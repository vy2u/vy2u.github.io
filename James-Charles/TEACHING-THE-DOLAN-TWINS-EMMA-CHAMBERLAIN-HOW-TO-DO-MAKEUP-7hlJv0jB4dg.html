back to my youtube channel first today's
video I'm joined with Maya sister squad
first today today we have something very
very special planned
Jake is going to be doing her makeup
without actually doing her makeup you
may be kind of confused how he's gonna
do that James is gonna be wearing a
blindfold give me another chance
Jake okay James is gonna be on the other
side of a wall and he's gonna be telling
us how to do our makeup and he's not
gonna be able to see us and we're gonna
walk we're gonna love us dividing the
you know dividing it to say like that
because they know that he's in a
different room okay try again try again
well they're gonna see it I'm like 10
seconds anyway what texture is the wall
styrofoam here's the cat there's there's
gonna be a little divider between us and
James and so when James is like he has
to explain it to us
he can't touch us or see us yes this is
probably hard for me because I can
definitely man I am a little bit of an
egotistical person and I definitely like
haha I also enjoy helping people too so
this is gonna be really hard for me to
try to explain this to them without
doing it and I probably gonna get really
frustrated sister what is your
experience in makeup oh my god I was a
cheerleader and I did like pretty crazy
eye shadow for that the girls on the
team would like make me do their eye
shadow because I was like actually kind
of good please take that with a grain of
salt okay but like I don't think I'm
gonna do too bad today okay don't let
ones are going down you don't I mean
don't winds that sounds weird okay grace
an honest go how do you think you're
gonna do today on a scale of what on a
scale how I think I'm gonna do on a
scale I think I'm gonna do good what you
just did on a scale how do you know that
I just hate one today today we're gonna
do seven okay I'm trying to win this is
it is it a challenge yes alright let me
try to win this challenge
okay what has been your makeup
experience the only time that you
my makeup and I did half of your face
okay are you ready I don't know what any
of this is to be honest
all right I promise you and I promise
myself I'm not gonna be like oh and and
do like oh I don't know how to do makeup
and make it really because it's funny
when it's not really funny
okay so first we're gonna start off with
your foundation so that's gonna be the
tan jar that has a black cap to it did
you find that there's two of those
neither of them were jars well it's like
a circle it's like a longer fit that the
long one was Emma's shade take you the
back of your hand and put like three
squirts on there but shake it up first
tell me a little bit sister sister
separated yeah oh my god she knows
you're not squirt like three two forests
worked on the back of her hand four
squirts this thing's running all over
the place
yeah you're gonna need a lot looks a
good big goop now use the bigger end of
the button how am i okay well I was
gonna say how am i doing but you can't
see me no can Ozzy so you put on my ear
too late it's on it pounce it yes it
kind of hurts when I go on my eyeball
don't push so hard no they are my actual
eyeball what and then make sure you get
your neck too and your ears a little
orange oh is it the same one that
Grayson you oh yeah this is pretty too
tan for you yeah I'm kind of pale there
should be another shade there what do I
do now it's all over my face me over
James I'm you use Grayson's foundation
that's not our problem I put the two
ones there for you specifically
you said the tan one not the pale one I
said a tan boy aback so you're gonna
grab um it's like a tan jar with a black
cap on it yeah it's okay no you know we
can't have flashback Mary flashback Mary
was she was cute oh okay I'll make you
necks it was gonna be concealer so we
have tart shave tape in there you're
gonna draw two upside-down triangles on
your face so you're gonna go basically
right from the inner corner of your eye
downward you should have said on your
eye before I started drawing it on my
face jeans what is on your face so you
basically want to draw a triangle
connecting the inner corner of your eye
like are you doing some alumina or
anything on my face right now yes that's
exactly to tell that we are all green
socialblade because we're part of the
Illuminati and then bring a little bit
of that concealer up to like the side of
your nose to a sister snatch Naz yeah
now I also put a dot right in the center
of your forehead above your eyebrows
like right in the middle got it okay no
this is a prank no okay another center
of your ten who invented this
can someone me did you really know do
you feel like around Ted so like it's
hard for me to find it but yes okay and
then like draw a line like underneath
that like tracing the bottom of your
cheekbone all right now time for powder
you gotta set it blend my eyes into yeah
you didn't say that okay now you're
gonna guard the laura mercier
translucent setting powder it's like the
bait tub with the cop okay open it up
and pour a little bit into the cap okay
this smells kind of good the powder
supposedly vanilla yogurt a little bit
but in a good way
and you like I'm gonna going to look
like flashback Mary I think this is
where my downfall is no there's a lot of
other places that you can fall down
later
now we're gonna contour so now that
you're all flat skin tone and you have
your concealer on to brighten up the
center of your face we need to use
contouring to chisel out the outside
edges of your face it's nap time
yeah let's do it where is this brush
jeans it should be it's in there it's a
it's a bigger brush yeah it's this I
can't see it I don't see it angle on a
brush it's just it's a mushroom cat mmm
turn to the side and there should be it
still really got a slight angle like one
end to be like taller than the other one
no some of the brochure should be
talking yeah there's more like that but
it's dark brown you said a light one
there's another one that's white and it
might have like some kind of brown at
the tip of the brown no sis
oh wait yeah yeah yeah but it's like red
don't tell me it's not red I can't see
it well you will in the future
hold your James don't tell me this is
not red well someone sit down future
James okay pause this video text me an
apology right now and you're gonna want
to dip into the metal
shade and the bottom row bottom ooh yes
are they're gonna want to use that to
chisel out the corners of your forehead
and then also your cheekbones how would
you put on there the whole thing okay
great now we have to contour your nose
so there's a brush and this is when we
snatch up so there's a brush and they're
angled fluffy brush but it's small and
it has a pink handle and it's dual ended
now you're gonna dip into this contra
palette again but it's the bottom left
shade not the bottom metal and use the
fluffy and what I'm going to do this
trick Gemma knows don't blend it like
all the way down the side to like just
keep the two lines like right at the top
center with a little bit less sisters
that break it made fun of in middle
schools whose main nose was so small I
thought it sounds like the opposite of a
problem 100 reading an issue it was like
your eyes are so small it's so weird I
was like dude that's something all evoke
Twitter are creating it yes you are
there is none see James and Emma getting
political play so now we're gonna grab
the blunt okay that took me a second be
like understand you're saying is that's
not English that's Miranda sings grab
the brush it's um it's has a black
handle it's fluffy and angled okay all
of them have a black handles that's not
gonna be my attitude okay and it has a
little bit of pink on the tip so yeah
those we love a good piggy tag no hey
now put that right on your cheekbone
kind of like on like the apple of your
cheek right kind of like above your
contour okay what's the apple of my
cheek like what what Oh Rosie do you
mm-hmm
now you're gonna want to grab the Beauty
Blender once again and dip into the
powder and we're gonna bake this and
make a video not cooking so really get a
lot of the pink on there right
the pink yeah use of the powder the
powder the pink powder the Macklin no
James you need to specify the Dana put a
little bit right on the center woman
what put a little bit kind of a lot of
bad you said that we good
this is not bully James Charles time
who's helping you
Thank You Grayson love you okay now
you're baking yep that is evident is
that what it's called yes sir bake in
the oven at 300 degrees babe doesn't say
you and I already have pretty like full
eyebrows so maybe we should just get
filling the man yeah there's like a
silver container in there do you see it
at the bronze oh yeah okay so you just
feel like brush that through your brows
and like kind of like brush them upward
so just gonna like put them in the right
place I think they're in the right place
well yeah but like making sure that get
long don't argue with me just do it not
going to do it and don't listening to
you Jean yes we're doing so good until
now no I'm on do it I tried James oh
this one's even more first no I was
doing so good too
do you think I could like clean it up
with concealer yeah nice okay I feel
like that good sister help you're gonna
grab the concealer again and then in
there there's a brush that has a black
handle and it's like a it's a flat like
square brush you're gonna define
underneath your eyebrow like you know
how my don't was very sharp yes you do
just go right under the brow and like
carve it out it's like making like a
lime does that make sense or sense okay
great well not be able to see your help
is so sister stressful okay how do I
like blend that out it's a fluffy brush
it has the block Brussels in like a
brownish top mmm 335 yes yes yes I'm
doing what I love doing you said yeah I
put a little other concealer on there
you done how often do you do makeup like
this every day usually or every few days
whenever I'm filming holy yeah does it
go round brush in there it's a kinda
like a dome shape and like it definitely
is already dirty with concealer on it
all these brushes are dude yes they are
but this one is like dirty with
concealer on it okay
did you find it yeah is it big it's like
kind of bag it sits in between big and
small yes medium medium yes got it I'll
then use that to pack the powder on top
of the eyelid to set everything in place
you probably did use the powder that's
on my shirt to pack everything to say to
employees humbly I ate a little bit of
it and it doesn't yeah that's pretty
good
can I eat it if you would love to I know
I'd love to we're all hungry so yeah it
tastes like vanilla yogurt oh my god
that's what Grayson said that's what I
said before
oh did you just do
James overworking me he's not feeding me
baby powder it tastes so good try it and
you sure you need it
yes sort of God a little bit like boys
like it's on your tongue whenever you're
blending it it's so good it'll well I
mean no but anyway
oh my god how much you eat Aang wait
Matt's will see that much so I like do
look like flashback Mary with a little
bit of contour right now I think I'm on
the right track with some nice little
eyebrows they're not that bad anymore
they were way worse before so feeling
really nice and confident and fresh and
clean about it and good and good and
fresh yeah yeah okay i shadow all right
what are we feeling um let's just like a
warm smoky eye look so grab on one of
the foffy brushes that I gave you that
has white hairs and probably has a
little bit of light warmth on the tab
now on the top left-hand side of the
palette there's like a mac and cheese
type color yes yes dip into that one
lightly and then you're gonna put that
right in the crease of your eyelash okay
I kind of know how to do this okay cool
we'll see how this goes okay cousin what
are you doing I'm trying to do my eyelid
crease but it's giving me a little
trouble I can't get in I can't get in
the inside of my eye does it matter what
I've only got like the outside half of
my eye I'm gonna fall out but I mean
that's that's expected right how much
are you using I mean not that much but I
just also didn't have my brush enough
well sister James listen to me you know
you're gonna be outside have like the
outer edge like towards her temple yeah
yeah why had you get on the inside
because it's a fan brush that's why it's
not that big what are you doing the
brush I'm sucking it
I love hitting okay grab another fluffy
brush smaller than that one
okay and probably should helping burn a
burnt orange shadow on it Oh hope that
whistle I think so now you're gonna want
to dip into it it's like a burnt orange
there's no yes okay the one next the one
on the right of it is no the one on the
left of it is the more orange of all the
right of it when your advisers
colorblind we'll just go at this color
okay gray and you wouldn't want to play
tap off the excess because you don't
want too much of that color and you're
gonna want to put that also in your
crease but more on the outer like the
outer half
kind of like blended and like as if it
was like like a hook like kinda like
going from the outside of your eyeball
- like upwards into the crease like
kinda like ground by shaking a little
bit like a drag queen
oh but like any good way though it
should be the same color but you should
pack it like right and I'm like the
outer area of your eyelid oh did that
already wow I'm a step ahead of you I'm
done
okay okay next okay I think so next up
is gonna be um the glitter whoa yay
sister spark oh oh oh hey did I why it
was really good okay I'm ready to cut
the crease then we're ready to cut the
crease okay love when you're never cut
the crease there's like a rectangular
object in there and has a gold cap and
it's like how do you remember all I'm
just like thinking right now holy how do
you remember all this so since we just
ordered a pizza right picture like a
corner of a pizza
I knew this better be the cheesiest
thing ever shut up so start from the
tear duct and go up around dad like
towards the middle of your crease and
then fill it in so the entire inner half
of your eyelid is litter tilt your head
back and look in the mirror
so then you have access to it without
having to like access to it I've
unlocked access to my eyelid
how's it look actually not bad like I
mean it's not my best work
this is like the tutorial for somebody
who like it's like me
it's an attainable look you know what
I'm saying right now it's time for
eyeliner I need a support that I want to
skip don't get that option when James
Charles forces you into doing things
that you don't want to do excuse me have
you ever done a winged liner before no
oh okay let's get into this line okay so
grab it's like a brown stick got it it's
shimmery it says Tom for you on it okay
there's two ends to it
why does they can really really tiny
point and ones like more of like a felt
tip marker point got it you want the
felt tip side okay so you're gonna start
off by drawing a line from like a very
thin line from the very outer like
corner of your eye it should be like
thin then yeah right about that um how
thick
did you make it um that's what she said
I'm when I get nervous I start saying
that's what she said jokes I could clean
that up and concealer though I think
basically it's like your boyfriend
cheats on you right and you thought he
was the man of your dreams he was
beautiful he was perfect and then you
know a new man comes into your life and
he's like thirty times hotter not only
that listens to the same type of music
as you not only that but also I'm not
gonna say that on James's channel and
moral the story is you're now winning
right it's like the best rebound you've
ever had and that is how I'm feeling
right now with this winged eyeliner
except for that I am still lonely and
single that's the difference
me it was good that looks good woah
really yeah not he found of you days
where you lose me James why
hello yeah I was focusing I think that
step just ruined it for me what did you
do
you ruined now James I did not what the
fuck ever I just ruined it no Greg then
I'm so pissed right now why cuz you can
ruin my face I just actually ruined my
wing blinder I just learn how to do it
so Wow
I'm so pissed right now why cuz I don't
want to lose okay so next gonna be
laches do I have to pick these up with
tweezers yes now grab the many pair of
scissors in there you want to trim off
like a tiny little bit on each end of
the lash on it okay now there's the glue
in there got it okay now just paint that
onto the lash band okay so is the glue
on there yes
okay so you want to like blow on it a
little bit I'll grab it with the tweezer
okay tilt your head back slightly and
put your face I close to the mirror and
then you want to plop your lash on going
from the center of your eye and place it
like right on there as close to the lash
line as possible and then once the
center of the lash is like on the center
of your eyelid use the tweezers to make
sure that the outer corner and inner
corner are both on your eyelid fully so
just take the top okay tape whoa really
good and you want to put it down as
close to your lash line as you possibly
can
so it looks like it's growing out of
your lens if that makes sense
it didn't stick I stuck it right where
you told me to take the lock off okay
and then put more glue on there and then
blow on it a little bit now like we've
it around a little bit don't put it on
right away it's like wait for it to get
tacky it's so cute how you're focusing
so hard on me yeah use it work okay now
we're gonna put on mascara on the upper
and lower you're gonna put it on the
upper lashes really carefully because if
you go on too hard it can pull the wash
off so you just kind of want to use that
and do it lightly to blend together your
real lashes or the
make ones and just kind of brush them
upwards I put my something Iowa's are
crying no I'm a man if you don't leave
their mascara chunky like it's really
easy to not do that right I don't
understand
oh wow okay yeah I'm good okay
oh my god James you're gonna hate this
should I blend out the baked now I'm so
sick of it yeah you can get rid of it
now we're done with last chance
so first we'll have a big fluffy brush
and wipe off the baked powder that's
sitting there there's a big header on me
it should be whip it all
did you already wipe it off I blended it
in how long ago when I first put it on I
think oh they were supposed to be there
the whole time
is there no powder there anymore no no
really
Oh where'd it go I don't think it was
ever there really okay so first you're
gonna want to spread to your face with
the fix+
like every something on my flake sister
spreads oh now dip the brush into the
highlighter okay and put it on the very
top of your cheekbones I'm actually like
not bad at highlight because I really
that's the easiest part yeah it's just
like right on the cheekbone I'm like
right at the top are you glowing for the
gods glowing for the gods sister what's
next okay now there's a little pencil
brush in there and four three one yes
okay I mean you're gonna dip into the
highlighter again okay and then you're
gonna use that highlighter and you're
gonna want to put it right in the inner
corners of your eyes okay
right like under the arch of your
eyebrow but below it oh yes I do this -
okay great on your brow bone okay show
you how my nose that's my part the nose
see how i'ma basically told like an
exclamation point so like draw a line
right down the center of the bridge
right in between those two contour lines
don't make it too wide or that ruins the
illusion and then stop right before the
tip and then leave a little space then
put a dot right on the tip like - blind
all the haters 100% yeah they give a
face like a good spreads
chuckles when I first probably yeah
don't hold it too close either - this is
giving me trooper phobia it has a quartz
in it what does this doesn't it
no it's disgusting good is it are you
sad I'm hoping in the highlighter again
for the sake of beauty beauty is pain
all right good yeah no I lost the final
stop yep liquidy doodahs oh yeah
okay so it's like a pinky nude shade and
it's bullfrog got it all right now just
fill in your lips just like normal
I'll just follow my lip boy yes on the
top lip you want to over line just a
little bit slightly you supposed to look
super do use a little bit yeah just go
slightly over your top lab uh-huh I just
want to like draw the lips N and then
