welcome back to my youtube channel for
today's video I have something very very
special plan that I actually don't do
very often and that is a review I really
don't do reviews that often mostly
because I have my favorite products that
I like to stick to an every single
makeup look but also when it comes to
reviews people love love love to share
their opinions and if you love a product
you're eating somebody's ass or you're
being paid to do so and if you hate a
product you're jealous you're angry
because you're not on a PR list or who
freaking knows every time I do a review
and I read the comment I could just feel
the brain cells being sucked right out
of my head but when I saw this launch
and when I saw the price tag and you
guys know exactly what I'm talking about
based on the title of the video I'm
talking about the brand new Kylie
cosmetics 360 dollar brush that I had to
show you guys the Realty I am gonna do
my entire makeup routine today using the
brand new Kylie brushes I'm gonna try to
use every single brush in here in some
difference that with my makeup routine
to show you guys if the brushes are
really worth the three hundred and sixty
dollars I haven't even started yet but
just going into it I will tell you guys
they're probably not gonna be worth it
so I picked up dupes of every single one
of the Kylie brushes from morphe I'll
tell you guys right now they are much
much much cheaper so I'm gonna doing a
1/2 my face using the Kylie brushes and
the other half my face using the same
exact brush do and we're gonna see what
style looks better in the end before we
get into the flow review I do want to
disclose something because this video
will not go all the way up my Fenty
Beauty video went I absolutely love
Kylie she's honestly one of my role
models I think she is beautiful and I'm
very very hard-working woman I am very
proud of her and her makeup line I think
so it's been absolutely incredible and
she is obviously killing it regardless
of what you think about her those are my
opinions you don't have to share them
not being said I am NOT on her PR list I
did not get these brushes sent to me
early in the mail I was actually gonna
have to wait another two weeks to get
them and order them just like everybody
else when they went online to the public
but major shout out to my baby but Kris
and Dominique who let me borrow her set
early I'm gonna give these brushes a
fair shot if they are amazing you will
see if they suck you guys will
definitely see I really could not care
less about the fact that I'm not on her
PR list
like I said beforehand influencers
literally cannot win I love currently
but I'm not on her PR list so apparently
I'm so angry
so hopefully this evens out the playing
field so I can give you guys a full
unbiased review that would have been
unbiased Vergara
last by these comments Oh there are a
lot sometimes now that that is all been
said let's jump into the damn brushes so
for the holiday season Kylie cosmetics
launched chart silver luxury brushed sat
which is right here it comes with 16
different brushes and the set of all 16
retails online for three hundred and
sixty dollars oh my god you get all the
brushes and a little silver carrying
case with them as you can see all the
brushes have little white hairs some of
them are duo fiber and some of them are
just a regular brushes and apparently
Kylie said on Twitter that these are all
real hair as well they are not synthetic
so that means they are I think not
cruelty free and not vegan so if that's
something that you were very out of it
about this brush is probably not the
brush that for you I've talked about
this a few times before but I per say
I'm really not the biggest fan of brush
sets when people ask me what types of
brushes to order I always tell them to
go through a website and really pick up
brushes that they know they're going to
use based on their different steps of
their makeup routine everybody has
different techniques and different
brushes that they like to use for
different things and I think when you
order a brush that they're always gonna
be a few brushes in there that you will
literally never touch simply because of
your personal choices when it comes to
makeup and that is really okay but it's
obviously money down the drain I will
say though looking at all the Kylie
brushes laid down next to each other
they're really hard not that many
brushes that I don't think I would pick
up and I feel like I could get a good
use out of all of them so at least
that's a really great thing if you are
someone like me though and don't like
brush sets all the brushes will be sold
individually online as well when the
full set launches I'm gonna go through
all the individual prices as I go
through my makeup routine but all
together these brushes equate to three
hundred and seventy eight dollars and if
you buy the set it takes eighteen
dollars off and goes to 360 what a steal
on the contrary I told her of all the
closest dupes I could find from morphe
and if you order all of these sixteen
brushes your total comes to one hundred
and fifteen dollars but if you use
Co change or ten percent of your
purchase which you've definitely should
it becomes one hundred and four dollars
which is two hundred and fifty six
dollars cheaper than the Kylie brushes
now that we have the price is all fully
broken down let's go ahead and start our
makeup on this side of my face I'm gonna
use the Kylie brushes and on this side
I'm gonna using the same dupes from
morphe and we're gonna see what side
performs better
let's go sir do my foundation today I'm
gonna use my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation do you guys know this is my
all-time favorite and for my less on my
face I'm gonna use the Kylie brush
number two which is the large stippling
brush this brush has and his
multipurpose face and body brush ideal
for blending liquid or cream makeup and
that retails for $30
the closest dupe I could find for morphe
was the mb5 brush as you can see the
color is different but obviously they're
both duo fiber brushes of a very very
similar shape and this one is $10 this
is definitely an interesting feeling you
guys know that I don't really do my
foundation where the brush is that often
and also this is a duo fiber brush so
it's really not that dense which is
definitely giving us like my coverage
but oh I really like this for the neck
so big so it lets me blend it in easily
that was good but over the face I don't
know how I'm feeling for a duo fiber
brush I'm honestly pleasantly surprised
with this application it definitely did
a really good job of giving me even
coverage all throughout but I will say
that census is duo-fiber
you can obviously see that there's a lot
of product in the brush now left over
and it's really not that dense so I do
feel like the coverage as an S fill as
normal if I applied it with a sponge
looking in the mirror the application
looks absolutely identical on both sides
they both honestly did a really good job
of blending it out the coverage is
decent I'm gonna take a little bit more
of that on a Beauty Blender and apply it
to my nose because both brushes did
leave my nose a little bit sad and you
guys know that is always a struggle area
for me these brushes both did a
perfectly fine job of doing my
foundation except one is $30 and one is
$10 and Kylie's line she does not have a
brush dedicated to concealer and I
personally never use the brush when it
comes to concealer either so I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply my shake paper
in the shade light as normal before I go
in and blend this out I'm going to cream
contour my face today using my benefit
hoola stick you guys know that I really
don't do this that often but Kylie does
have a good a cream contour so for my
Kylie side i'm gonna using the kylie
jenner brush number seven which is the
medium stippling brush and these retails
for $22 and on my morphe side i'm gonna
using the m49 to literally the exact
same brush and this retails for eight
dollars I'm gonna put this in in the
hollows of my cheeks
on the jawline and then in the corners
on my forehead as well
oh just like the first brush as you can
see this is doing a really really great
job of blending everything out there are
no streaky lines that everything is
looking at really really seamless I'm
not gonna go over to the morphe side so
before I actually use these I thought
that these brushes were really really
similar shapes as you can see from this
angle but if we turn them to the side
the Kylie brush is actually a lot more
thick than the morphe brush I am
noticing right away that I have to blend
a little bit harder for the morphe brush
and this shape is actually not gonna lie
a little bit better but then again $22
$8 here's the Kylie side and here's the
morphe side once again application looks
exactly the same I'm just gonna add a
little bit of shape tape right here to
cut the contour and then I'm going to
blend everything out just out my face to
place today I'm going to using my
setting powder mixture you guys almost
my all-time favorite and for my Kylie
site I'm gonna be using the Kylie brush
number three which is the medium tapered
brush which retails for $28 and
originally for the morphe side i had
picked out the m5 30 but now looking at
these i'm realizing that these shapes
are nowhere near similar so I definitely
will take on that one and instead I'm
gonna be using the morphe r3 brush which
retails for or $12 you guys know that I
usually use my Beauty Blender when it
comes to setting powder so this is gonna
be a little bit interesting in this
definitely a little bit babe to be an
under eye setting powder brush but you
know what we're gonna give it a try to
see but this is very very round
I would definitely prefer a more tapered
brush to do this something like this one
from its segment like this can really
get like right under there as you can
see but I will say the fact that this
morphe brush is a little bit more
tapered and synthetic I feel like it's
applying the powder better because it is
a little bit more dense and kind of
packs it in there whereas the Kylie
brush is obviously real hair so it kind
of feels a little bit strange to apply a
setting powder with but once again
application looks exactly the same to
set the rest I face in place I'm gonna
use in the Kylie brush number one which
is the large powder brush perfect for
blending all of her face and body
powders and this one retails for a
whopping 48 dollars the closest to buy
could find it was the morphe m42 for the
shape is slightly different but they are
both
huge dense powder brushes except this
one is $10 so you're saving yourself a
whopping 38 bucks I'm just going to take
this brush and tap off the excess oh my
god whoa that actually caught a lot of
powder I'm certainly not mad at it let's
go ahead and try the morphe brush oh
whoa
once again picked up a ton of powder
once again application looks exactly the
same for bronzer today I'm gonna play
the benefit hoola bronzer and I'm gonna
use the Kylee brush number four on this
side of my face there's some retails for
$26 and on my morphe side I'm gonna use
my a matte 5 to 3 which we chose for $15
what I do like about these brushes is
that they are pretty dense so when I go
and would like something like bronzer
like a cream contour and kind of stipple
it into my face and kind of blend it it
doesn't pick up the product underneath
which it's a really really good thing
gonna do the same exact thing on my
morphe side once again applications
exactly the same next for a more precise
contour I'm gonna go my Kat Von D shade
and light palette as always and I might
kindly say it I'm gonna grab my number 5
brush which retails for $24 and on my
morphe side I'm gonna grab my m4 l5
which retails for $8 and as you can see
these are literally the exact same brush
just gonna tuck that right into the
cheekbone and then same exact thing I
really doubt you can tell on camera but
in person I feel like I can tell just
because I look at my face with makeup on
almost every single day the bristles on
the amphora Pfeiffer morphe are a lot
softer so it's making I'm much more
diffused contour wears on like highly
brush the brushes are a lot more dense
which makes it a little bit harder for a
diffused application but to the everyday
makeup person nobody can tell it looks
the exact same must be real next I got
apply my blush which is gonna be a Mac
peach is my all-time favorite and from a
Kylie site I'm gonna be using my number
6 brush which is the rounded blush brush
this retails for $28 then on my morphe
site I'm going to use my g1 brush which
the closest dupe I could find this one
is $8 now looking at these obviously
this is I said that I've brushed I would
really never use this for blush that's
definitely more of like a buffer brush
for like blending in found
you know what sister Kylie says it's for
blush we're gonna use that for blush oh
yeah I did not like that I would just
never reach for this shape or type of
brush when it comes to blush application
I usually use my e4 brush which as you
can see it's very very soft ankle tilt
let's do get a very very like diffused
light wash of color this is very very
done so I'm probably spooked to try out
the g1 oh my god Kylie side
Murphy side it certainly doesn't look
bad I would just literally never reach
for those brushes when it comes to blush
ones like contours are all in place I'm
going to bake my face as usual using my
Beauty Blender while I'm baking the oven
I'm gonna go and quickly dry brows off
camera then it will come back for the
cleanup process Kylie did not release
any angled brushes so I'm just gonna use
my eyebrow pencil and I'll be right back
alright sisters back to business I'm
gonna grab my tart shape table as always
my Kylie brush number 14 this one is $18
and my m22 for $3 you guys know that I
usually do my concealer application
using a flat top concealer brush so I
really don't think that I'm going to
enjoy the application on either side but
the brush did fine
to stop my eyelid concealer in place and
primed for eyeshadow I'm gonna use like
Kylie number 10 brush this is $20 and is
the large shader brush although it is
super super dense this is literally not
an eyeshadow brush I don't know what she
thinks she's doing calling this a large
shader brush trying to get this to put
any eyeshadow on the eyelid and make it
like any sort of defined or blend it out
it's not happening really do like the
shape and density of this brush for
packing on translucent primer to the lid
but this is classified as a large shader
brush that I would literally never use
this for any sort of shading on the
eyeshadow so I think this would be one
of the brushes that like I said it's
useless to the set for the more of you
said I'm gonna grab my ab five-to-four
brush and this one is $6 so you're
saving yourself $14 just to set your
freaking eyelid concealer in place I
want to do it very Kylie I look today
and I do have a red carpet later on so I
don't want to do anything too too
intense I'm gonna grab the MAC Cosmetics
Act
Patrick Starr i shadow quads I am so
happy and proud of sisters are for these
amazing collaborations they are so dope
so I'm just kind of doing a fun eye look
with these today for transition shade
I'm going to dip into this light brown
shade in this quad with my Kylie number
15 brush this is the tapered blending
brush and it is $20 and on the morphe
said I'm gonna do the same exact thing
using miami 513 and this one is $6 oh
whoa okay not gonna lie this feels
really really nice on the eyelid next
gonna dip into it this shade right here
using my Kylie number 12 brush this one
is $20 and I'm going to use the exact
dupe which is the Murphy I'm up for 3 3
which is $6 interesting even though
these brushes are two very very similar
shapes and sizes the Kylie brush
actually doesn't really taper out on the
top it kind of stays the same density
whereas the morphe brush does taper out
a little bit more so I think in this
scenario I do prefer the m43 3 from
morphe simply because it allows for a
much more blended application I'm next
going to dip into this brown shade using
my number thirteen brush this is the
small shader brush and it is $18 and on
the other side I'm gonna grab my m15 3/4
morpheus same exact shape this one is $2
I'm just gonna pack the shade or write
on that outer V it too deep out that
edge and then pull it slightly into the
crease same situation with this lash
brush as you can see over here it kind
of looks a little bit unblended
that's because the top edge doesn't
taper off at all it's actually more of a
rounded thing it makes it really really
hard for a precise application in the
crease I'm gonna go over those I just
make sure they're really blended out
using my number eleven brush from Kylie
which is $16 that is this angled
blending brush I personally hate these
brushes and think there's literally no
point to them they do absolutely nothing
but just for the sake of it I do want to
use all the brushes and for the morphe
dupe is my m5 16 this one is $6 for my
eyelid I'm gonna grab the Kylie
concealer brush this is the number
fourteen brush that I use for my brows
earlier and dip into this shade right up
in here and I'm going to give it a
little bit of a spritz with some fixed
puss and then I'm just gonna pack this
right on at the inner eyelid I know this
is a Kylie review but wow sister
projects snapped on these shots they
look so good
for my lower lash then I'm gonna dip
into that same warm brown shade on my
number thirteen brush and also my m15
three brush that I'm gonna use this to
define it
oh that was way easier with that brush
and then finally with my number 12 slash
m4a3 three brush I'm gonna dip into the
original transition shade and just go
right over that bottom edge alright says
there's off-camera I quickly just went
and applied some a wing liner on a both
eyes to snatch up this look popped on
some lashes these are the new bounce I'm
dragon lean minis and then of course a
mascara to blend them together looking
on the mirror this eye look is beautiful
sister Patrick you killed it with this
collection but that is not the focus of
this video let's be real both of these
eyes look exactly the same
let's go ahead finish off the rest of
the face I'm gonna grab both my big
powder brushes and brush away the bake
before we highlight I'm gonna get my
skin a quick spritz of my mac fix+ just
to kind of meld all those powders
together because let's be real we
definitely have a lot on today for
highlighter on my kylie-san I'm gonna
grab my number eight brush which is
these small fluff brush and dip into my
honest sauces to Hollywood illuminator
you guys notice my all-time theme and
this one retails for a whopping up $22
she's gonna give this a slight spritz as
well and pop this right on that you own
oh whoa okay obviously this is doing a
really great job of applying a blinding
finally I mean damn I will say though
once again this brush is not really
tapered on the top it is kind of more
like slightly rounded almost even flat
and it is pretty dense so it's
definitely not like blending it out as
much as I would love it to my morphe
said I'm gonna grab my our 31 brush this
one is a total of five dollars once
again giving it a light spritz and then
popping it on the cheekbone yep same
exact glow you guys know when it comes
to held in my face I usually will reach
for an M 501 brush obviously the shape
is very very different but I am going
for exact dupes today I do wish this
brush was more tapered like this one for
a more precise application but you know
what we can't always get what we want in
life I'm gonna go back into like highly
number 5 brush and just make sure that
my contour and highlighter are nice and
blended together and not looking too
and say my something on the work he's
had at Miami 405 next we have the number
nine brush and then do my Harford this
is the morphe 3 one you guys know that I
really am NOT the biggest fan of fan
brush especially when it comes to hiding
I just don't like the application work
around this I'm gonna use it today just
at the sake of the video this one is
twenty dollars and this one is five
dollars I'm gonna dip into the slightest
bit of artists Couture Illuminati and
just place that right on the high points
of my highlighter I feel like that did
nothing once again make that did nothing
can people just stop making fan brushes
literally this has been a PSA James
Charles hates the eye brushes and last
but certainly not least we have the
Kylie brush number six team this is a
tiny pencil brush this one retails for
eighteen whopping dollars compared to
the morphe m43 one which retails for
five as you can see they are both tiny
pencil brushes i will say that the more
if you want is a little bit more tapered
so that is my fault but let's be real
based on a trend of all the brushes
we've tried so far they're gonna perform
exactly the same for my inner corner i'm
gonna be using one of the tarte chrome
pots and this is the shade of top yacht
this is a trick that I tried a few days
ago and I absolutely loved how look this
is just so bright and blinding and of
course I'm using my Kylie number sixteen
brush I'm gonna spread set the slightest
bit and just pop it right on you see how
bright that is oh my god this is
literally the best thing that ever it's
so freakin pretty hello I recognize I
just went head and throw any lip quickly
off camera this is the ofra liquid
lipstick in the shade
and that completes this luck as you can
see here we have the Kylie brush aside
totaling at three hundred and sixty
dollars and on the other side we have
morphe brushes totaling at one hundred
and four dollars now that I face is all
complete and I've used every single one
of these brushes from both collections
let's go ahead and spill the tea once
another Kylie brushes on line let's be
real we were all shuck as held by the
price point three hundred sixty dollars
it's actually for a new brand like Kylie
is way way too high that being said
though almost every single product stage
release in the past has been pretty good
like I said I'm not on her PR let's so
everything that I've tried from
has been a personally bought from me not
being paid to say anything but it is
pretty good stuff so major props to
Kelly for that based on Carly's past
product history it going into this I
really didn't think that brushes were
gonna be bad at all and let's be real
they really weren't most of the brushes
did exactly what they're supposed to do
and one of them being number seven in my
opinion even performed better than the
dupe from morphe on the other hand
however there were a few more view
brushes that in my opinion outperformed
Kylie mostly being the eye brushes a lot
of the blending brushes specifically
number 12 did a really really great job
at packing the color on there but I will
say that I wish they were more tapered
all the tops of these brushes are very
very rounded which is great however
they're very very dense at the top and
don't really taper out which makes it a
little bit harder to get a more precise
application it's actually when it comes
to crease work overall what I recommend
the Kylie cosmetics silver luxury brush
sat absolutely not the brushes all did
exactly what they were supposed to do
and applied the makeup perfectly fine
just like normal
now the brushes are fraying and they
aren't really really good quality I just
don't think it's worth the price point I
really just can't justify spending 360
dollars on her brush set when there are
brands out there like morphe making the
exact same dupes for way cheaper I mean
literally I think the cheapest morphe
brush was $2.00 and the cheapest Kylie
brush was $18 I mean there's even like
BH Cosmetics out there where you can
literally get the same exact brush set
for $15 don't get me wrong I really
really love Kylie but that's literally
some people's entire like house payment
or rent payment or car payment like that
is just way too much it is not like
these brushes are literally doing our
makeup for us or face tuning our photos
after I'm not gonna tell Kylie how to
run her ban because clearly she's doing
a perfectly fine job on her own she paid
almost 500 million dollars last year
literally a living legend but I do wish
she would make her mice a lot more
affordable so more people could get them
and not just a beauty gurus all that
being said though if you are a huge
Kylie stand like myself and you want to
support her on this brush launch at
least you know you're getting good
quality brushes for your money alright
