welcome back to my youtube channel so
I'm currently holding back in Europe for
the holiday season and I'm of course
with sister en not playing this game
again when he wasn't he brought in
California a few months ago we had so
much fun throwing our videos together I
know he looked like he wanted to die the
entire time but deep down he definitely
did enjoy and oh yes you're just a liar
not only did we get to have fun quality
sister time tell me those things
together but you guys absolutely love
them as well they did it so well I got
so many comments said that you guys all
the videos sister in gained a ton of
followers on Instagram which was so dope
and he's definitely been enjoying the
fame so for today's video we decided to
step it up a notch and I have all I wake
up here in front of me back home in New
York we set up a DIY filming studio and
today we're gonna be putting it in drag
and you said it out this No
so do you know like anything really
about drag all I know is you makes you
look like a girl oh hey do you like
anything else
well I know it's not when you're
transgender it's like for performances
good okay yeah
so the art of drag is basically it's
just for performance purposes and to get
everybody excited and to get you to put
those bills in the drag queens panties
so today we're be putting even though
jaya hills and things that you guys
enjoyed the last video so much give us a
thumbs up and seedling it to 200,000
likes I know your sisters can do it that
was good
we love that youtuber in training so
that further ado if you'd like to see
brother Ian I guess get transformed into
sister en that was clever keep on
watching
so this will keep the makeup oh dude
this is just crazy
this is gonna keep the makeup off you're
doing a glue stick forward we have to
glue down your eyebrows so we can give
you know I can't do that James you're
not going on like this no no you got
glue in there
you're not gluing my eyebrows
Walmart on Ian's base makeup when we
post the original video so many of you
guys thought sister in the soul track
but not only didn't get enough alright
but you also got a lot of interesting
comments a little weird phone to be
funny to read so and I'm - you guys
today so our voice said no don't see
their name why not this DM says hey in I
know this may sound a little weird but
can I see a picture of the bottoms of
your feet no what are you doing open
your eyes and look there you go
no don't raise your eyebrows one girl
asked for my snap and then continue the
conversation e on by saying do you know
how to calculate the percent by mass of
water loss by the chemical Assessor
needed some help with her chemistry
homework wait so how do not look
recognized in public - yeah really
what's like the where's and what's
happened you so far
I think really where that's happened I
haven't actually got like a lot of weird
sister covers either you guys are
usually pretty good which I super
appreciate and some other boy 80 asked
have you guys ever liked the same person
at the same time
well naughty question but show the
camera what you guys got each other for
Christmas
it's November 1 - I don't buy anything
for Christmas for him Oh Louis easily
asked you can be someone really famous
who and why soon as that voice hello
suicide voice those guys are they
robbers
yeah that's dope why would say probably
know Kylie so it definitely has a pretty
hooded eyelids as you can see doesn't
have much validation it opens its eyes
so I'm gonna make his bra March pretty
high tonight so I can give him some
bigwig liner to kind of completely fake
his eye shape so this should be
interesting
Allah asked biggest lie you've ever told
each other I wasn't gay last few idiom
swap positions what do you think Ian
would be famous for and what does he in
think you'd be doing without theme
obviously a really good question go you
Kayla I think you would definitely be I
don't Phoebe making YouTube videos but I
think you'd be like famous for like
buying sneakers for sure that's what you
already do what do you think I hope you
doing if they wasn't we're going to do a
magnet school cuz their grades are good
thing is how do I be studying some weird
thing I personally don't like it morphe
35o palette use code James for tempeh so
I'm going to use this to set the
concealer underneath Ian's brows
beautiful and then I'm gonna be using
the Jacqueline help out of course
shutout charmville

they've seen preschool forecast or any
girls interested in me and because of
you look how girls like from like yeah
really let's started talking to me again
once I mean yes I don't know you how
does that make you feel
I guess Pat the turbo last what would
you do if you were invincible for a day
invincible or invisible hope you know
who's better at reading someone asked do

cuz I'm not gonna embarrass myself
I got points off in eighth grade oh my
music test cuz I couldn't sing thanks
for trying
hello yeah make up oh my god holy crap
we're stopped hello Patricia asked
what's the worst thing we've got in
trouble for I don't think the worst
thing I've ever gotten to a four is well
this is gonna sound crazy by in eighth
grade I actually got punched I went home
with a headache and he actually ended up
breaking his arm which was like nice
karma so I got called in to look up I
got called it's like the school
principal's office talk about it
obviously and I'm expecting him till I
get in trouble right
and I literally get called in and like
Dean is asking me what happened like are
you okay what's going on and I explained
to him like this kid makes fun of me all
the time and I finally stood up for
myself and they front of him back then I
got punished and I started out he
literally goes
mmm that's where your sarcastic mouth
will get you I was like oh no miss bitch
so I literally it went home and of
course like might well itself literally
just hopped on Twitter and started
tweeting about it and I was like this
then he literally called Mia again at
the next day I was like I thought you
have some few choice words to say on
Twitter and I had literal printouts
like all my tweets on printer paper
and I was like oh no girl we're not
playing this game today I know your ass
is not about to blame me for the fact
that I got punched I set up for myself
it is so important to not victim blame
and then I walked out of his office
Sturridge I guess it was really kind of
like getting a tool but that was the
clothes that are under getting in
trouble
that's a pretty good kid now we have all
ice completely in this looking so
beautiful and I'm gonna apply it the
lashes and I have these custom stocked

highlighter and let it glow James what
is that you're singing I don't know yeah
oh yeah oh okay you tell me no cuz

hair change my outfit that's a joke I'm
not changing my outfit well you're not
wearing that yes I am we'll be right

you learn something about the art of
drag that it takes oh it's not fun it's
painful so you know like you obviously
think you look crazy and I'm not used to
seeing yourself like this could you ever
