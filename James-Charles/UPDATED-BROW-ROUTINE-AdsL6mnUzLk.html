back to my channel says the very very
start of my Instagram feed and following
in general my brows ablaze and saying
that are very very controversial as
always that widely talked about people
either love my bushy defined brows or
they hate them with a passion and they
describe them as things like Lego or
caterpillars but either way they're
still talking about them which in PR
sense is very very good relative what
people think though my brows have
changed very very drastically from the
start of my Instagram career they have a
much more natural feel large and in
charge but much less sharping like so
for today's video I thought I would sit
down and do an update a brow routine
because I don't think I've ever actually
done one on this channel before and I
get so many questions every single video
ask me how I do ever else because for
the most part I do usually do them
off-camera to save time so that being
said if you want to see how I get my
very very natural yet bushy largeness
charged and defined brows make sure you
keep on watching
alright so I already went ahead and I
did my base off-camera stopping my
foundation concealer powdered my entire
face did a little bit of contour and
highlight disorders look too weird and
then baked my face as well and then it
wiped it off I do this in every single
video and then my next step would
usually be my eyebrows which I usually
do off-camera just to save time
Oh like I was saying today we were going
to be doing my Bravo changes that I do
in every single look whether or not it's
on camera my brows have changed so
drastically since beginning my Instagram
career so I thought it would be
absolutely perfect to sit down today
auntie nipples edits at cosmetics I give
you guys an updated brow routine just
honest eyebrows today I'm just going to
grab the a benefit precisely my brow
pencil and I'm just going to take off
the bottom end to use the spoolie and
I'm actually just going to start by
brushing through via bra Harris and
brushes an alternate I'll pour it just
to see kind of how big and bushy
eyebrows we are just to get a good idea
of those wear underneath filling in and
what areas don't need as much of the
product first product I'm going to go in
with is the brow bone conditioning
primer and I'm just going to take the
top off and I'm going to do that to you
Gillian time so I'm just going to run it
through the brow hair just like a primer
for your face this is a primer for your
brow hair so
get some light and ready to full product
and really ensure the arousal of all day
long and it also makes like I said
before your brows as full as possible so
you get a good idea of where you should
be putting the product and getting
around on week and I'm just going to go
back and delete one more time just to
evenly distribute that product with the
brow hairs and once again it push the
hairs
if you have any shape our hands this
would be a perfect time to grab your
tweezers and pluck them out before we
get too far into these filling in and
there's the brow routine
I'm just really carefully putting out
any stray hairs that I know are not
going to be in rough shape I do get
asked all the time to like who does your
eyebrows only conduct or you get them
done and I actually do my brows
completely myself I've been tweezing my
eyebrows for a very very long time and I
do consider myself pretty good at it as
discipline I also please a lot of my
friends brows as well and have made some
fantastic brow transformations if I do
say so myself but I really do like
tweezing my brows I would not trust
anybody else to whack or the res out I'm
just way too scare and obviously as a
beauty guru I have a very very distinct
style or what I like my brows to look
like but you are someone who wants to
get them soda or please please do this
is definitely not like an easy thing to
do in any way shape or form and if you
don't trust yourself please leave a true
professional because I've seen many
Ferrothorn stories
my poor mom is someone who actually is
definitely over plucked eyebrows when
she was younger and a she regrets it all
the time and she's always asked me to
draw in her brows for her which I always
do of course but the poor girl barely
has any eyebrows left so definitely be
careful when you're plugging and go to
professional if you don't trust yourself
to actually fill in and shape the brows
that I will be using once again see
precisely my brow pencil in the shade
number 4 I like I like to tip it this
because it is super super tiny and
defined so it really lets me get really
really light and defined lines and in
this front area - I can really sketch in
those tiny hairs and make it look
realistic I don't like to start on my
brows I kind of sketching out the bottom
line so I'm just going to start in the
front here and I'm going to really
really really lightly if they're going
to shape out the bottom outline
as you guys can see my brother's really
do not have that much of an arch either
so when I'm in this inner corner I
really like to start kind of low and
pull it up at an angle creating more of
an arch effect that isn't really there
and then of course if I make any
mistakes or anything looks too harsh
I'll just witch over to the spoolie end
and I'll comb really lately over it just
to blend out throughout this entire body
I'm going using the spoolie and that a
lot is kind of switching back and forth
back and forth to get the perfect
results when I get to the outer corner
I'm going to take it the template number
two really lightly flick it out towards
the end and I'm just going to sell one
tiny little window just like that when
it comes to shaping around you're
obviously going to want to do what works
best er cliches but I find for me
personally the I relate to file browser
goes up and then clean it out I don't
really like when my brows goes down I
feel like I have like a very very tall
face so I like to kind of widen it as
much as possible to my plane this brow
out towards like this area resident
towards the bottom of my cyber I get a
much like wider more masculine effect I
guess but do whatever works best for you
I'm not grabbing a pencil I'm going to
start defining the tail so I'm just
drawing a line up here connecting it
right down to that foot then like I said
it growing that fully to just blend over
each transition like I said I do like to
fake a little bit of an arch on my brow
unlike before once again I thank God
those old brow days are over I'm going
to what start by dropping the pencil I'm
going to really lightly sketch a upward
line if anything I like be a bottom on
my browser you're going to find but I
don't like the top to be a super design
as well because that's what we get into
like the Lego Sharpie style bar that I
used to have a on trial is over up done
with temple
never wanted to get again when it comes
to the inner corner of the brow I really
like the hairs to be very very wispy
lucky and I like there to be a natural
ombre style at the front to the tip of
the brow this part obviously being a
whole lot darker I'm just catching it a
few tiny little hairs really really
lightly
the front here just to kind of give it a
little bit of shape but not doing any
real going in and then once again
describing leave fully on the end of the
precisely my brow pencil and just
brushing through the brow hairs
dependent brush them up in the right
direction and to blend through the
products and making sure that there is
no area where it is very very
concentrated
you know what any sparse areas we don't
want any it's our four areas either the
goal is to have that nice ombre where
everything looks very very natural but
still defined what's that browse all
roughly put in place my Mex M is going
to be to grab my favorite concealer
which right now it would be at arch
shape tape and just put a little bit on
the Box on my hand and then we're just
going to clean up that brow I'm going to
really like they follow the line that I
sketched in using the brow pencil and
like I said before and does not need to
be a perfect because II now and in time
where we get to speed up any mistake
regardless of what product steps or
techniques to use and at your brow
routine I feel like this is one step
that is absolutely vital no matter you
walk as far as what your shape is or
make about your style it if you like
just cleaning up via bottom of the brows
me that looks so much more defined they
can look a whole lot cleaner and I would
definitely recommend you to do this if
you don't already do it now that the
brow is all smashed and defined my last
and final step is going to be to going
to be a benefit gimme brow gel in the
shade and number three I absolutely love
this brow gel because the wand is so
frickin tiny you can really get in on
the hangar to make sure you're not going
to make any mistakes I can't even tell
you how many times I've gotten my brows
to look so frickin good and then I
bought into the brow gel and just got
like one round line or smudge little be
the worst thing in the entire world so
like I said I really really do it like
this wand just like they go steal under
the brow actually really really good a
brown gel it's an absolute necessity I
think it good protein it's just you guys
s bagels on your sweatpants are chilling
product and the hairs are going to start
to move around so the shell was really
interested to hear stay at lock in place
in the rock and move in your brows would
be all day long no matter what you
alright guys I just draw in some laughs
and a quick gloss and that is the
completed look and video for today my
brow style has changed so much since
beginning my Instagram feed thank God

defined brows using only a few products
