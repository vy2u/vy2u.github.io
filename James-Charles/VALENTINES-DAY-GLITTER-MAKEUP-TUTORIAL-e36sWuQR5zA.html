stoked oh hi sisters dreams Charles here
and welcome back to my youtube channel
so I've been so busy lately doing so
many different shoots and so we
different projects that I have really
had any time to get a creative look done
so today I really wanted to sit down and
throw something together that was cool
and conceptual it is officially February
which means this month is Valentine's
Day I'm not excited it is my Luther
holiday because I've been single for it
for 17 years now and let's be real it's
going to be 18 in just a few days
because unfortunately I will not be
sharing this special day with anybody
special and I'll be staying at home I
thought I would do a more non wearable
look so today I created this super fun
glittery pink inspired valentine's day
luck with hearts it's cute I don't know
what else to say if you guys like to see
how creative this let's just make sure
you keep on watching
to begin today I'm going to prime my
face using my eighth benefit
Porefessional primer as always if by
some miracle we do end up getting a
Valentine's Day kiss we're going to get
a whole lot of sweaty and a whole lot of
excited the last thing you want to do is
sweat our makeup off the foundation
today I'm going to use my holy grill my
makeup for ever ultra HD foundation
stick in the shade y 315 a few guys
commented on my last video asking my tin
pre-primary nose like usual and it is so
my favorite trick but I lost my Mac
concealer that I always used for it and
I've been way too lazy to buy any one so
yeah as always I'm gonna use my guitar
shape to concealer to conceal and
highlight my face
I'm feeding to the basepart today pretty
fast you guys did see me do the same
exact routine literally 50 million times
you all know I don't really like to
switch out my products and as I look at
super intricate so I want to make sure
all the focus is teaching guys how to
achieve this valentine's day look
bronzing consorts identities maker
accomodation the council and a shade and
light palette the murphy r7 brush and
the m4 35 and then i'm just going to
bake my face quickly using like cody air
some powder and a powder puff so while I
face is facing in the oven at 350
degrees I'm going to leave this on for
about five to ten minutes and while that
bakes I would normally go ahead and do
my brows but today I want to show you
guys this game that I've been loving
lately I have an absolutely addicted to
playing best fiends lately I'm sure you
guys have arisen because a ton of
youtubers have talked about it so major
shadows Christian for sponsoring this
video
when they originally reached out I was
like no thank you and then I actually
download the app and started playing and
then I was like oh you know what yes
thank you this is so fun and not even
gonna lie I've been playing it non-stop
Bessie's is a free adventure puzzle game
where you connect objects of the same
color to jesus loves you guys all man
sat out your hear me sauce all the times
out like escape rooms and like wanting
to escape from prison one day and all
this weird type of stuff I know I'm
weird but I like thinking and using
strategy so this game is literally so
much fun for me since it is February and
this is a Valentine's Day tutorial I
thought this would be perfect to mention
this entire month up until February 26
there will be a Valentine's Day themes
characters and all types of puzzles that
you can solve and there's going to be a
special types of Valentine's Day as well
so make sure you play it then I'm
probably on at level 34 that I just
sorted playing a few days ago so I think
I'm doing it pretty well so far
and if you want to check it out the link
will be in the description below to
download for free like I said I really
been playing non-stop so let see if you
guys can beat my level comment down
below how far you are and good luck
sisters and may have got a little bit
distracted but at least I beat the level
but now that the Vegas all done I'm
going to go ahead and just wipe it off
so we can move on with the rest of the
face to start my brows today I'm going
to use a benefit processing my brow
pencil in the shade at number 6
I've been doing my brows a lot more like
light and fluffy lately with the pencil
as opposed to my usual honest al vog
brow and honestly I'm kind of like
loving it so maybe we're saying goodbye
to the James Charles brick of an eyebrow
RIT she will maybe be mad with this new
style of brawl that I've been loving
lately as I said I like to kind of fill
them in as least as possible and just
shape them and then I'll use the gel to
kind of brush the hair upwards and then
fill in any gaps that I have to take
them look really light fluffy and like
natural and then depending my eyelid in
place using my morphe e45 brush and some
more tarts tape tape concealer and then
just going over with my translucent
powder just off my eyes today I'm going
to be using my very very damaged violet
balls wholly realized shadow colors I'm
first going to talk with my m4 for one
tubing into a why ensign and putting
that in my crease as a transition color
I'm just putting this in my crease in
circular motions and when I get to the
outer corner I'm also going to pull this
eye shadow out and up in it like a
outward the winged e shape next going to
grab an M 4-3-3 on the same shade wine
and dine and deepen up my crease and
outer V
I'm also dragging whatever the excess
product is on this brush into the lower
lash line because we're going to have a
lot of stuff going on down here and then
to Hima em for for one with no pass on
and just blending out those edges
I'm next I'm about to shade a teddy bear
on the same brush and deepen up that
outer corner
that's going to take my 35b and my m56
to would zip that into that blood shade
just to define the very very outer part
very super gentle and light with this to
be careful but it doesn't get too dark
and messy
this look is taking a whole lot of
blending and for some reason my eye
shadow is not being cooperative today I
mean a really surprised will ever be a
video with James Charles where something
doesn't go wrong honestly probably not
clearly it's not this fun to do a half
cut crease today I'm going to use my m17
0.0 and this world pink shade on my lid
after got my glitter glue at home
classic James so I just use my eyelash
glue and some craft store glitter both
things that are typically not safe and
just did this house cut crease I would
not recommend that strategy I would
definitely recommend using regular glue
and cosmetic spray glitter but when
you're me sometimes things don't always
work out for the lower-left-hand I'm
going back in with my m4 for one and the
same shade wine and dine from the violet
vodka and I'm going to start to blow out
that bottom shadow I'm also making sure
to connect that pink up to the upper
lash line X I'm going to grab a teddy
bear on the m4 33 and deep enough that
outer corner
and I'm of the 562 in the block on the
35 B I'm going to just how to be at
lashline
so the lower lash a time to be gluing on
all sorts of different styles of glitter
I'm going to use this really pink fine
glitter pink little bit a little bit
more chunky and indeed pink heart
sequins
oh my god this is pretty uh I sort of
have in mind my upper and lower
waterline using my NYX jumbo eye pencil
in black bean to make the losses blend
together then I'm just going to get
Miami 213 in the black shade from the 35
B just make sure there's no skin showing
between the waterline and the lash line
alright guys that is when I all complete
of course obviously a - the lashes I'm
going to do is the one off camera
quickly to save some time then we can
finish up with the rest of the face
alright there we go that is the finis I
look for lashes today I'm going to pop
on the Lily lashes in the style of Janet
okay so I just found a video with Tana
mojo and I found out that apparently I'm
like the only person in human history
that puts on mascara ten lashes so today
I just did lashes and over the Pala
mascara to blend them together and that
was the easiest and eyewash should ever
go onto my eye and I'm very very angry
that I did not know this sooner the
amount of times that I've been putting
on a lot and it literally felt like 20
minutes so you know gluing it down a
million times
oh wow I feel betrayed I feel like who I
feel left out like I read all of my
comments and letting out a single lot of
you has ever come with his saying Oh
James you should try to put on your
eyelash first and then do mascara for
because it'll make your life a million
times a year instead of sending
seventeen years putting them on for once
you sisters have let me down in life
however stronger so off with my Anasazi
moonchild palette in the shade pink art
using my morphe M 501 remember you can
use code James for 10% off all morphe
products and then I go layer over top
using my star crush little palette or in
the shade rosy future and you can use
coded jeans for 50% off all their
products I'm also going to use the same
highlighter can highlight detect my nose
for less today I can be using the ofra
liquid lipstick in the shade of the guna
Beach never mind okay I take it back
okay let's try this again I'm going
using more free liquid lipstick in the
shade
now I don't like this one either well
last time I'm going to use Santa Anna
from Oprah hopefully this color will be
it
honestly whatever at this point hearing
them I still hate this let so I'm going
to layer the shade Angeles on top at
this point I don't know where we're
going with this honestly just like
giving up but I think this is the best
we're probably going to get today we're
done I just put on those two little
lipsticks then I added that highlighter
on top from star-crossed minerals and a
little bit of glitter no busy words
let's look anyways somewhere just go all
out and be extra and I'm going to set
this in place with my all their settings
right because after all this I do not
want this to come off
I think Urban Decay send me a message
that they want this to come off because
I just ran out of things oh god all
right guys and this is the completed
Valentine's Day glam I really really
hope you enjoyed this video I'll see you
guys before Valentine's Day with the

luck on finding somebody for the day
