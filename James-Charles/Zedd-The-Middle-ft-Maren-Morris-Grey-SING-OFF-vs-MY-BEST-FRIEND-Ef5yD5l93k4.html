I wanna be in like all the time
ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm picking it up picking it up I'm loving I'm living
I'm picking it up picking it up picking it up
Take a seat, right over there sit on the stairs stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Wait could you turn around cuz I wanna be with you
Havana ooh na na
Half of my heart is in havana ooh na na
He took me back to East Atlanta na na na
Ayo I been on, sis you been con
Bentley tits on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been off, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off
All you gotta do is stay, a minute, just the your time (I like it like that)
The clock is ticking so stay
Oh tell me you love me, I need someone
On days like this I do, on days like this (I don't deserve this you look perfect tonight)
I woke up in Chris Brown's body
So now this all turned into Freaky Friday
We out here drippin in finesse
It don't make much sense
Got me drippin in finesse you know it you know it
I just had to let you know you're mine
Hands on your body I don't wanna waste your time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
I got new rules I count em
I've been running through the jungle, I've been running with the wolves to get to you
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Is that it?
I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting a little tired of the pop music.
What no this is so fun!
Can we throw it back a little bit?
What?
Just trust me
No. I don't want no scrubs
Scrubs is a guy that can't get no love from me hanging on the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
Say my name you say my name
When no one is around you say baby. I love you
You ain't running games
Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out got me singing like
Na na na na every day, it's like my iPod's stuck on replay
Always gonna be another mountain always gonna wanna make it move always
Always gonna be an uphill battle, sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
This is real this is me I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda-
Really, all-star?
Oh Shrek, sweetie. I am so sorry don't ever
Oh man, I think we should bring it back. You got a little carried away
You asked to throw it back in the first place
Here we go
Haven't I made it obvious
Haven't I made it clear
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Tell me where your love lies
Wish I didn't spend the night, underneath the sunrise
Tell me where your love lies
I'm in love with the shape of you
You push and pull like a magnet do
and when my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Just say you won't let go
It isn't in my blood
Just say you won't let go
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle, no no
Yeah, we killed that!
Hi sisters! James Charles here welcome back to my youtube channel
I really hope you guys enjoyed this little sing-off between myself
