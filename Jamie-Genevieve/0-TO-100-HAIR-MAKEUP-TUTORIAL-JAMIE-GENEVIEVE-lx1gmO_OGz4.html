I am going to show you how to get this
entire look as well as here and I do I
do talk about it later it's not much for
here tutorial but it's basically how I
meet right here not frizzy and look a
little bit a little bit more healthy a
little bit more cool and I'm also going
to show you how to create this entire
makeup look this look is actually when I
did last week in the vlog and you guys
really want to see it so this is me
creating the tutorial for you yeah it's
just basically my go-to everyday makeup
I've got a couple of meetings today so
this is exactly how I like to look when
I go to meetings but you can also read
it whenever you want if you would like
to see how I created this look then
please stay tuned hello
so this is me up just woke up so I'm a
bit but we're gonna tie this hair over
the way this is crazy so this is
basically what happens when I wash my
hair and then let it air dry and I do
put some products and it's try and keep
it healthy but I'm gonna show you guys
how fix it in like five minutes I start
with her face this makeup I died in last
week's vlog is pretty much like most
standard go to everyday makeup I've got
a few new products here to try though
and it is really really quick and it
still like super glam it's mostly skin
focused like most of my looks these days
but we're just gonna jump right in I'm
gonna run through a skin cured really
quickly because there's three products I
use in the morning that make a huge
difference
first is it my kills iris extract
activating treatment essence I spoke
about this a few times you just get like
two drops on your hands rather than
scaler push that and then I use my daily
driving concentrate oil from Kiehl's
everyone knows I love this it's so good
I've used this for months and months and
months so just rub my hands together and
push that in and then lastly I've been
using this new moisturizer this is Lila
rich or whipped cream moisturizer from
drunk elephant this is brilliant it's
really nice and late and it's got one of
those pump action so you just push down
and then whatever product you get is
enough for a full face and neck I'm just
gonna rub that together my hands push
that into my skin and then the magnetic
and that is pretty much follow us in
mornings really really simple keeps my
skin not too clogged up and fresh we're
going to go in with the
centi Pro filter soft matte instantly
touch trained work on a name one pump of
that is pain I've been using this pretty
much every single day I'm just going to
put that in the same two videos or I
cannot wait to put makeup on today and I
just like to rub that and the Saturday
videos right over my nose as well chain
in my forehead okay for foundation I'm
gonna go in with my NARS natural reading
long my friend ation ye much the pumps
unless are really small so you need
about four of them and then I'm just
gonna put that on with my iconic London
buffing brush I really like this brush
and I got a few comments from you guys
last week in the vlog asking what for in
Dacian I've been reading and I have
pretty much been reading this I'm trying
to get my hands on darker shades of my
life sale orientation because I really
do love that too and I want to kind of
properly taste out what one's my
favorite it was those two but this is
amazing I just went in dampens my Real
Techniques brush because I forgot how
much I liked that with this foundation
and I feel like it goes on really
quickly who isn't even a little bit I'm
gonna add some coverage now with my
concealer this is the flawless fusion
ultra longwear concealer from Laura
Mercier this is brand-new and this is
the shade 3w like to try that side feels
quite creamy I'm gonna go over at Mellet
we're just gonna blend that why feels a
lot more hydrated and then the Tarte
it's me my eyes look about this small
there though so we're gonna go in with
some powder I'm gonna go in with my
Charlotte Tilbury you brush flawless
finish predator you guys know that I
absolutely love this stuff I really do
recommend that I know that it's kind of
more high-end but it's just so gorgeous
I'm just gonna say that like I usually
would now I'm gonna go end up with the
Hillah quickie quarter stick I use this
whenever I'm doing Phil glam every time
since the Maldives
because I finally tried
so good so just literally chuckling like
that there's not much method there maybe
I'll try it blend away with it well that
makes it really quick and easy next I'm
going to take my butter gone sir when
you face B and I'm gonna check that on
with my Smith 1 1 8 brush and that's
just adds a little bit more warmth and
it's a it's that quarter as well and it
just kind of runs up all of the usual
Elios all Murphy's and since I started
using that loads of you guys have picked
up a lot of you guys have said that you
love to and it's just excellent next I'm
gonna go anywhere as my Mac powder this
is the shape she'd start it's called and
it's actually called the highlighting
powder which is a little bit misleading
though bit misleading was obviously the
contouring powder but they call it a
highlight powder and I'm just gonna go
in with the same brush get a little bit
of that and then just contour at the
very back it's like a more
three-dimensional to use more shades to
contour and what do you have tiny touch
of that to just bronze the sides of my
doors and you guys know I just use a big
brush for this nothing too serious
and then I don't you know under here
this is cold shade sir and in this one
is the highlighting powder in late sweet
as it number 105 brush from zoeva and
I'm just gonna use that underneath the
contour and I'm just kind of cleans up a
little bit you can use that just under
the eyes just to mattify a little bit
more and Haley I'm really excited from a
highlight today so I'm not gonna do that
quite yet but I'm gonna go in with my
eyes now Derek's a egg I've got the
naked petite heat and this is just such
a cute little palette and you can see
it's all just really readable neutrals
it's gonna be so good for me traveling I
think so I'm gonna go in with the shade
horse build first which is just this one
okay this is just a little blank canvas
brush and I'm gonna go in with that
horse pale color and this look is super
natural in the eyes but it's just enough
definition to carry off the lash and to
make the lip look really complete the
look look look look complete and another
thing is you don't believe me school
that darkness si which makes it really
and I'm doing it before my eyebrows
because I want and I'm just using my
usual when doing her strokes and I'm
gonna use a slightly more dense brush
and the same shade next West wild thing
which is just here just to go underneath
hi oh yeah I just realize I didn't seem
you guys I'm gonna do the same thing
another say just hot spell and whale
thing mixed together and then I'm gonna
county that whale in shape that's really
Orange a1 just up into the crease a
little bit and that it was just my
everyday smoky eye just enough
definition use a nice warm shades but
it's just so easy so the product I've
got here for highlight is new to me
really excited to try it oh this is the
dull light famed rate which is the
darker shade this is just so cute I'm
sure it's just like it started off like
an Instagram trend but you can get in
Topshop now so when I was in Topshop the
lovely gonna haul it gave me like a bag
of stuff to try it because long story
short I got governor bag and I mean
someone stole it and they give me some
more stuff which is really nice but this
highlighter it's made to be unbelievable
this is the shade shine bright and I'm
just gonna use it with a little so we've
a powder fusion brush you know I love
this brush that once before it's mirror
face first I'm just gonna use my old
nature this is a new pollution
protection one and I'm gonna go in with
this she's got some real highlighting
absolutely beautiful it just do the
usual bets for hey it's just above the
arch my play I'm gonna swap over top
smaller brush and just do the tip of my
nose give his bowl and then my brow bone
as well that's pretty good I'm going to
just quickly warm up my face again so
systematic of 150 brush just epic huge
powder brush
Nickelback head just after applying that
high layer blend everything together
that's crazy
last dude our eyebrows back in the goal
okay so the way I've been doing my
advice is really easy it's just
my benefit precisely micro pencil in the
shade number four I'm just gonna brush
through my eyebrow and then West this
new super blonde here I actually really
like her dark eyebrow I remember even
when I was really young I used to look
at girls it's really really blonde hair
and dark eyebrows and things they look
just so cool so I'm gonna just use this
pencil the define of flow and then join
them with a natural grace I kind of
bring that a little bit lower and then
on the arch I actually bring that higher
and then I just slightly expand and
drape so that's it really blossomed off
the gun I'm gonna just fill in the
middle part and then I love to use this
really just to brush through make sure
the products all even I'm just gonna use
the old strokes in the front you can see
that they're friends like it is way
darker what you can do is you can get a
little bit concealer just put Pitt bit
on the back of your hand got a little
angle brush here and what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna really neaten it up
underneath its gonna make sure that it's
a solid layer first grab a little bit
concealer not too much and then we're
just gonna tell you that up and then I'm
going to use my 3d brow tines this is
actually in the shade number two also
from benefit and I'm gonna just cool
through the hairs and this I actually
make some look a wee bit later because
it's got that kind of gold a reflex
through it the brush is actually really
really good for getting a little bright
here's at the front and that is a severe
braid okay and I'm just gonna do it the
same thing on the other side I'll do it
on camera but I won't talk you through
it
okay a little crazy just not just beer
with me I've got my lashes with glue on
I'm using the lovely lashes and the
style Miami and I'm just gonna check on
some mascara that says the new iconic
London mascara I don't know what's
happened and the industry at the moment
but I think someone's got like a new
mascara formula because this that's
absolutely brilliant and so is the new
baby fat one as well like I feel like
everyone she's got this amazing new
formula from Miss Cadenet and it's
really good for a bolt in my lashes as
well which is obviously it's different
important to me love a big thick bottom
lash by the way if you ever get mascara
on your skin you just let it dry and
then usually spoolie and it just comes
off top kit I feel like because I use
such thick eyelashes I can get away with
a really dark blue because my lashes are
so black can it takes away from the
darkness of the brave her Gorger there
nah I'm just gonna use my extra little
buddy I caught a canoed lip liner which
is one of my faves it's a really really
nice color and I'm going to use my
maybelline superstay matte and on nude
lip color and the shade driver this is
one of my new favorite all-time nudes is
so nice
i order my little LC because i feel like
it
she flawless and then i just need to do
a mental wreck freak my vehicle
underneath my eyeball
okay know that makeups done it's paper
here let's free this crazy brightness i
mentioned that this is just what my hair
goes like mary i think it's just because
it's really really bleached the first
thing I'm gonna do is brush it and I
just gently make sure everything's free
no I don't know if that's technique
would work if you have super Street here
or well actually believe it occurred
here it would work I hear you're
actually still a little bit done and the
three products that we really like can
our first is the way Rose hair and body
oil so you can use this on your body you
can use it your hair this is my second
ball and I use it just all the time for
the ends of my ear and then no to do
this fail as well and then recently I
got a package through from igk really
really cool your products best one is
the mistress hydrating here balm and
this is the rich coconut oil gel and I
use kind of both of them to be honest so
to show you what I do just know you
might eat it I'm not gonna lie it's a
really simple easy thing for me to do it
so what you do is just grab one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
pump oil rub that in your hands and you
just start really good through your hair
and I kind of scrunch it with the oil
this all happens because I've got my
hair done by Nina X when I was in New
York and this is what she did and I was
stressing over and she was going end to
my hair it was so much oil I was like
this is just gonna look so good easy
size prompts and don't be scared to get
up at the roots so I have pretty dry
hair naturally anyway so maybe that's
why this works so well and then also
because blonde can make really dry this
gives it
relation and texture and make solutely
super shiny and then now I'm going to go
in with some hair balm that says the
mistress one just start off small and
then with that stuff I can I go through
it in sections and it underneath as well
a lot cuz most of my friends is
underneath oh that's the sales career
I'm gonna get someone a nice plane I got
my hair done
basically it was clean we blow-dried
that we spelled it with cuddles and then
we did this so this is just playing with
the natural texture of your own here so
if you want to stay lit you can you can
put cuddles through your hair and then
do this and it's just a lot of pleading
around we're going with coconut oil gel
knife this stuff's a bit thicker you
hear smells really good to have to doing
this and I'm gonna warm up with my hands
first and that's pretty much it I'm not
really sure if that counts as I hear
tutorial because I know that I basically
just put tons of product than my hair to
make it look way but there you go that's
how I do it like I say it's the ghetto
who did it before so I killed my hair
first and two cuddles and maned at it
and it looked unreal it looked really
really good but for me some of this
really don't get it here for day-to-day
that's where it's totally fine it
doesn't bother me at all and then if you
were to slip this old back into the
couple bun or even like a little pony it
would look really sleek and hydrated and
separated and quick ooh so yeah I hope
that counts so you guys that is the
entire finished look
other than that I will see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
