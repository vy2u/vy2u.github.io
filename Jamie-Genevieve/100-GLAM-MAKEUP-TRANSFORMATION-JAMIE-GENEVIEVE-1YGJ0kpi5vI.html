I'm going to be showing you how to
create this entire like a super glam the
most graham that I've done and the
longest time because we have everything
going on we've got a smoky eye but it's
a blue smokey eye we've got later we've
got glitter
we've got lashes we've got fill face
boot feeling the best looking the best
that's all everybody see how I created
this look then please stay tuned
yeah first things first get my hair on
my face
the trainer I am going to be using as
the Too Faced hangover to explain where
I've just been really really liking it
because it gives me that beautiful dewy
bones to my skin
I'm just taking two pumps of that
rubbing my hands together and applying
that all over and end up not a little
padded so no works to perfect the next
product I'm going to go in with aids
actually my eyes we're going to do eyes
first today because I'm doing something
real special this is the shape tape
primer I've been really really leaking
it and then we are going to use those as
we're just gonna screw it onto the eye
oh very right up to the brain now I'm
just gonna set this I came out with my
Charlotte Tilbury flawless finish powder
and that's just so that I can wear it
makes it so much easier to blend on top
these are at the makeup geek pepper
pigments I think they're absolutely
gorgeous I used these yesterday but the
code I'm gonna use today are the teal
and the kinda darker blue is well a
length of colors down below this is from
yesterday but it's still got blue in it
so that's fine and we're just gonna use
this brush to start applying the blue
into the crease it's going to be like a
smokey eye but with a bit of color it
will be super gorgeous I promise I'm
gonna go in with the blue first and even
though this bright color is really
pigmented they actually blend really
nicely as well gotta close with my nails
and I'm just using the side of the brush
to make sure the blames looking nice and
smooth now I'm going to go in with the
darker color
just right here and we're just gonna
start building up that should we be yeah
I'm just gonna go in the crease first
onto the lid a little bit and then when
you need to you can go back in with your
fluffy brush just to blend that I say
that they blend like I've been dreaming
so easy and I don't actually don't think
that that's really popular with really
bright eye shadows something's fighting
them quite chalky but these guys are
stunning I don't know how this is gonna
go because this is really different
tones than what I'm used to but the next
product I'm going to use is the block
party shuttle by dose of colors this is
the shade caffeine queen which I am
we're gonna spray the brush for maximum
impact and we're just gonna put this on
I just love these eyeshadows so much and
then we're gonna enhance because this
sparkling eye shadows are actually
silver which you can see no starting to
pick up when we went with the darker
blue and just intensify this crease a
little bit more I'm just using a teeny
tiny two to four brush from zoeva one of
my faves I'm just using really taking
the circular movements to make sure
that's all nicely blended before I do
any laner or lashes I'm gonna go in with
the Tarte white clay pot and this is
gonna be the best thing for the inner
corner for eyes I'm just going to take a
little eyeshadow brush pick up some
product and we're just gonna stamp that
and then Acronis you can see how bright
that is right and we're just gonna use
the same brush with no product on buff
that out a little bit now that we've got
the fight on to make it a little bit
more natural
I'm gonna go in with the K key Beauty
highlight palette and number one I used
this yesterday and it's beautiful but I
want to use the lightest shade today
this white gel liner before we do the
makes it so strong that shadow I've got
mileage has the most gorgeous silver
glitter reflux I'm gonna intensify that
with my next silver glitter and glitter
primer a little bit of the butter Cramer
on the back of my hand and I actually
like to use a fluffy brush just to apply
a little bit of this onto the lid I just
feel like this makes it go out a little
bit less blocky it goes on a little bit
more random notes on that I want to do
some later I'm going to take my hair
cosmetics superhero laner remove some
wings far mascara I'm going to use the
it cosmetics superhero mascara I've
actually been really really liking this
I said it crumbled and another video but
it comes off really really easily and I
actually really enjoy that because it
wants to tug at my eyes
it does actually last all day and it
comes off it leaves a soever I'm really
liking this actually lashes we're gonna
do the Lily lashes in Miami lashes are
on time for Bros same technique I've
been using for a while this is my
benefit 20-footer a poster or GL and
this is gimme brow and all I do is go in
with this first and name this when it's
drying out and it's so easy
actually I'm a flippin liar we're gonna
do foundation first as the Charlotte
Tilbury flawless filter and I like to
just use this on the kind of high points
of my face because it gives me a really
beautiful do you finish the my
foundation that I've been an absolutely
love a to come to this mmm yes he pumps
a murderous gonna buff this into the
skin an explanation Cornwall is just
been absolute best I've been using it
for a fear little whaler actually and
religion Old West so well now for
concealer I'm gonna go in with my NARS
soft matte concealer and Beauty Blender
and we're just gonna pack this stuff on
it just gives it the most beautiful
light on dry and flawless for night now
we're going to use the Charlotte Tilbury
probably dark to say it everywhere and
by everywhere I mean under eyes and
smile lines cause I do not like fire
everywhere where our base is done we're
gonna finish off our eyes I'm just gonna
go in with the same colors that on the
top underneath eyes okay we need
something bottom mascara to finish off
the eye brows I'm going to use gimme
brow right through them and build it up
now is that our eyebrows and our eyes
are finished we're going to go in with
bronzer which is going to be my NARS
casino I absolutely love that this
bronzer and I like to just bring my
bronzer down my neck a little bit to
make sure there's no lines and they in
it to highlight the face I'm going to
use the tkw new highlighting palette and
I'm going to end it with this shade here
