channel today we are going to do
something a little bit different a
little bit fun I'm going to tell you 20
random facts about me so I've seen this
video and going around you should fail
whale mode and I didn't like the idea or
her because I would love for you guys to
know a little bit more than me let's
just start when I must tell I you x'd to
set with my little coven
I think she must have been her into at
the time and I would swap her to ten
pieces look at split up to a penny coin
for a one pound coin the positive pain
was better than the time I convinced
know that my coin had more valued do I
was for prayer for money
Chris I'll admit I absolutely hate
grating cheese I'm not scared of it I
just hate it it makes me feel sick I
hate this feeling of the sweaty block of
cheese and my hands it's like hey I just
don't do it I don't do it I just don't
do it at me watch either by the cheese
or Jack has two divinities I named
nearly all of my pip Jack even when I
was really small so like I had a dog
called Jack from when I was going to
eight years old
before that I had a rabbit hole Jack my
granny the other day told me that IV had
two fish called Jack and then I met Jack
my boyfriend
Jenny I fell in love with Jax knows 15
and I was near accessible and Scotland
and he was my friend
big brother and I cannot remember me in
him it was Rivera Jax's that you just
saw this kid Stephen I'm like I was
saying I'm so obsessed we did not start
going out properly until I was 18 19 but
yes love at first sight I doesn't
actually really real a cup until I was
like 15 I did not have any interest in
Rico
whatsoever when I was younger the most I
would do is maybe like green glittery
eyeliner
with North God I thought I was like the
cheese thing ever again that my high
school days I thought I was the coolest
because I had braces glasses and I had
our home dye job on my hair so I had
like my natural color with flashes away
through the I did at home I saw so why I
thought it was amazing
I hope really quite a lot for that when
I was in school I used to go to skiing
my friend I've been skiing since I was
four years old and there is a boy that I
really fancy and one time on the way
home from skiing lessons I plucked up
the courage to ask him out on a note so
I wrote on a NORAD please will you go it
with me and he said no he said no and I
broke my heart when I was little me and
my mom and dad used to go to car boot
sale if you are not from the UK carpet
fields are playing once with a yard sale
but everyone kind of goes with their
cars and nice set and look like car park
of the field and you basically fill your
own and I used to get so excited
about this because I look at all my
stuff and be like who would not with my
stuff nice just amazing and I also just
behind me Judy so I would get my
strength I put pink on the string and
tie them off and make little clasps for
them and you get so excited with making
this Judy and selling it I thought I was
going to do really well I think my mum
bought a necklace of me and then some
exchange early from lady bought a
bracelet and then that King died when I
was really small
I had a slight obsession with facing
people every really bad face debate
family members my dad used to just put
his palms flat on my face so I could
waste it and my cousin used to bring her
friends over and I returned
right then it was bad I think it's a cry
for attention personally when I was a
very 13 years old I fell into a big box
of glass in the garden which was from
our window we had been smashed we took
all the glass and put in a boat and my
mom said Ginny what you don't follow
that big box of glass and I did I failed
in both the glass and I've actually
still got a little bit of glass in my
arm because I cannot see getting it too
you know it doesn't hurt anymore
but you can feel it you can feel it
rolling around in there when I was about
3 years old I jumped off a bit and put
my arm right on because I remember I
don't have to actually into the work so
when I was 3 I hope this I'm jumping off
a bit and then when I was maybe about 5
or 6 I was learning how to read abate
and my dad he is a baker he is he's got
more bike so when you're on a motorbike
you're going at that speed that you have
to tilt your body when they're going
corners and I was waiting at a debate
with stabilizers and right daddies like
lead around the corner TV leader and
corridor so I was just sitting it's
pretty much stationary and I displayed
please and burn and out test fault and I
still think it's his fault even we
bought me sweets in the leave the
hospital and we'll your fault that one
time when I was younger my granddad
thought it would be really really fun to
go and see a bad wheel so he took me and
my two husbands into the car and we
drove me really kind of our up north and
to go into your very field I don't think
it was fun I think it was smelly I can't
really remember it I think it's one of
those things that might have kind of
blocked out a little bit but yeah that
happened my first ever job was a kid
soft play so it's like one of those big
centers you go to rest your children and
you go and you let them into it with a
big huge jungle gym and
played in their slaves places that they
can pee and be sick and I used to have
to throw kids parties when I was fifteen
I smelled like chips all the time I was
going to say when I was younger reversal
spell the kids I lake is film a movie or
a song a lot
I'll just in repeater I'll play it on
repeat until I get back over like I used
to sit in more Alice and wonderland and
then rained it and water all over again
and rained it and watch it all over
again and then maybe watch my favorite
set and then I would watch it all over
again and then even just know that goes
nuts at me for this but I will just
listen to the same song in the car all
the time and saying really low really
badly
people ask you the question clay law and
a lot of people are surprised when you
meet me in real life but I am a tall
women I am 5 foot pain which i think is
like 173 or 76 centimeters I'm really
called black me do you so we're healed
yeah dude I didn't ever that well I'm
Abed women I'm all women I was a
studious gamers and I was under a spell
kind of armor suppose but I used to say
four hours and errors and plea riemann
ratcheting Klein and spirals and uphill
games and something like child games I
shall have my playstation 2 with
simpsons hit and run i have all the
spirals they moved it onto my ps3 and
then jack saw applications for which i
have lacked and quite for as though and
i finish them but that I'll get it and
I'll set that and all this plea until
finish it I used to does not leave the
house in the field goes ok I'm system a
game since when I was watching everyone
else's fact the Kenna included their
fears or something within like I
genuinely have no fears month descends
at the white I don't like spiders that
March I went ghoulish crazy over holding
them like I totally like you don't
bother middle and there I love didn't
and - bother me will snake and any
animals don't bother me more skewed
animals I personally think that dying at
the hand of an animal would be like
liquid which imagine Jimmy James we
YouTuber die by getting en by a shark
that's better
I have seen every single episode of The
Simpsons and first part every single one
when I do my makeup as I'm not filming I
will just watch programs and nfm
cleaning I'll carry my iPad around and
watch programs if I am editing I can
have something on in the background and
a derp and still be able to watch it I'm
good at multitasking like that but yeah
I've seen every single episode and I've
only got one season like the Gothic
Widow but I'm saving it until like I'm
not well or of course a week off and
just sit and watch it and cry so here
it's amazing because I was on Twitter
actually some windows right there
asshole
and my last fact if you want to call it
fact is just basically another
representation of how weird I was when I
was young I used to get dry spaghetti so
you know the steps of spaghetti I used
to get those get two of them and there
was a specific Tom and Jerry episode
that the Jerry was leading an orchestra
or Torme I can't remember one of them
was live in an orchestra at look like a
big canal like saying I don't know I
don't know anyway I used to stand in
front of the TV and my parents and
pretend I was conducted in the orchestra
must be such a spaghetti and then every
so often I would just cool and then
stuck it in the roasted AAA
I just loved that I thought it was great
1/8 always eat roast potato or for my
monthly off my mom when she's cooking
yep
so you guys that was some random fact
about me some of them you me I was not
already some of them you may really have
not wanted to know but hopefully you
know me a little bit better
I would love it soup sure I would love
it if you guys wrote in a comment around

little bit more with you guys other than
that I feel like this by delivers give
