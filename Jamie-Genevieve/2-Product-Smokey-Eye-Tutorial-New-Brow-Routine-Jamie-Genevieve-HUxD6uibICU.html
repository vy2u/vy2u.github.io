hi guys welcome back to my channel and
see if you're gonna do updated daily
routine because I have like my eyebrows
grew back I think with summer coming up
and I'm hopefully gonna be going
somewhere relatively nice at some point
I don't want to have half to die bruised
for when I'm not with many of you couple
thing that we have sort of community
so I've like them growing a little bear
and I'm using all honest as a Beverly
Hills product because I am finding name
the base I think it's really easy to get
your place totally on fleek no it's
really easy to get your face that can
sharp and dark and sculpted just who you
want I'm so I'm using then and then I'm
going to use two products to create this
eye look it is the easiest smokey eye a
row and as two of my new Charlotte lb
products I'm using two of them one of
them one of them and that is my new
eyeshadow pencil from Charlotte Tilbury
that I'm going to be using the saw I
will show you how to do that if you'd
like to see that stay tuned and I'll see
you guys next week bye
I'm just kiddin you dog oh say hello
hello YouTube he's absolutely amazing we
only got two days ago so I use a fresh
little baby he's nine weeks old
yesterday and he's going to the vet
today yes joy thank you
makes me very well-behaved and he's an
absolute delight me and Jack are very
happy starting off with Anastasio
Beverly Hills in chocolate this is the
depth a pomade Palmer I don't know and
I'm just using I mean Mike to eat in
brush to create the lure line of my brow
then I
memik on the tops order Alain parallel
and I do cannot overestimate my art and
I make the brows tree or then it really
is using quite a lot of product and I
create like to moist and my brush first
then I just draw Alain straight to the
front of the brow and then instead of
coloring the blow and I select the
product upwards notice that I didn't
start from the front of the brow I
though I always start in the middle of
the brows or the front isn't too strong
it makes a massive difference making the
arch really defined
then I'm going home with the tinted brow
gel by anastasiya and this stuff is
great for caught in the hairs and making
them a little bit darker and as we can
look really really neat I also like
pushing up the front of the brow just to
make it look fuller then I'm going in
with Kevyn Aucoin skin enhancer and SX
all four with our Ella Massacre angle
brush just to really sharpen up the brow
take away any kinda mistakes or Mason s
and just because it's a little shade
lighter than my skin tone is a nice
highlight around a blow blend that
concealer n top and bottom then I'm
going in with justify eyeshadow by
Illamasqua and there's a weaver fluffy
crease brush and I'm just using that as
my transition shade so that's the
product one of the two that we need for
this eye look and I'm just using that
right along the crease and I kind of
round shape then I'm gonna go under the
eye with the product as well it's a very
light product perfect for a transition
shades so you don't really see it too
much but just make sure it's perfectly
blended this is the color chameleon
pencil by Charlotte Tilbury and bronze
garnet really beautiful - extra
fantastic pigment and I'm just using
that in my waterline
all over the top of the lid though these
pencils have some serious staying power
you don't need to worry about the most
recent throughout the day
tried-and-tested so I've colored in the
fill lids and I'm going can i underneath
the lash line and the lower lash line
then going back in with my fluffy brush
and I'm just going to blend all that eye
so blending out the bottom and then I'm
blending out the top into the eyeshadow
shades surprisingly easy to planes as
well a really really nice quick airy
makeup and they have quite a few colors
actually as well I'm going over again
with a pencil just to get the peppermint
really strong and to get like a nice
metallic shine and then I'm just going
to buff away any edges just to make it
look nice and seamless going with a few
coats of mascara
top and bottom obviously
and then these are just really cheap
Peter lashes I've got off eBay but
they're nice for just adding a little
bit of film it's apply those once the
glue is tacky make sure that all blended
in and that is the finished book super
easy a nice warm smoky eye with two
products thank you so much for watching
bye mm-hmm-hmm are you hungry baby dog
how do you feel being a dad Jack do you
feel paternal yes oh you're so beautiful
