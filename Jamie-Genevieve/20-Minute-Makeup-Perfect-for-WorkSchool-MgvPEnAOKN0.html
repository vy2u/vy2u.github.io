week we are going to do a 20 minute
makeup challenge so basically what I
asked you guys on Twitter this morning
it was a little pool and what you'd like
to see and you chose this so I just
thought this was a good idea because
quite a lot of makeup looks I do or
maybe a little bit more intricate or a
little bit more glam or they take a
little bit too long so this is I really
think it's easy natural makeup and I'm
using a couple of new things which my
site about a couple of things that I
bought when I've been overseas and yeah
I did challenge myself to do this in 20
minutes I was looking at the camera
recording time and I feel personally if
you deduct the time that I spent looking
for things breaking things dropping
things and talking I then definitely 20
minutes are late
yeah I just think this look is really
fab for school or it's a really nice can
I look for a good work and obviously the
easiest thing is what you can change the
slip to be read propel penc anything you
want so obviously I did neutral because
that's me and also I have blue here for
the moment
blue green teal mermaids I've heard and
passing so I just thought a neutral it
with Luke nice with my murmured here the
first thing that I show my youtube
family it and I hope you like it
I hope you liked this tutorial if you'd
like to see how I create this like
stitch and excuse my sporty face okay
let's do this so first thing we're going
to start off with is both the drain face
face as always and yeah excuse my spotty
feet I picked it don't know why also
City so we're going to use Bobbi Brown
face face all over neck
this is mechanical to look when I'm a
rush when I sleep N or yeah and a rush
which is quite a lot at the time to be
fair and then I'm going to get my face a
little spray of the lemare face mask and
this is by no means a necessity and your
makeup routine I I love it
that's it
it feels expensive Nathan we're going to
do is I'm going to go in it with the
hourglass foundation in golden this is
the new stick foundation I picked up
when I would are we and I'm just going
to draw this on my face this would be
bit dark
Sileo beer I don't really use enough for
it to lit too dark
I literally draw all over my face like
this like I said this is a quick makeup
this is what we do in moon in a rush I
go right over my lips and I'm just using
my Smith 1 1 5 brush as always but I'm
I'm going to bring that down my neck as
well because it is too dark for me but
because I repeat Han and because it's
got tattooed I can't do it anymore you
can I'll just name it so this color
matches me really nicely when I've got
feet hang on if you look it stain I'm
just going to pick up between my brows
cover up my sports destination I really
like it and it's a lot it's like good
coverage and it gives your skin a really
nice luminosity but it does not wear as
good as other foundations so it's just
like I'm a bit too creamy I think but I
really like it and then obviously
because it's too dark for me what I
would do now is when with my shoot tip
concealer from Tarte and the shade
light/medium I'm a future for this
concealer have you certain maybe a video
I'm just going to draw triangles
triangles I'm just going to highlight
with this and that's going to bring the
kind of foundation color back to my
color probably not a baby but this is a
good way to wear foundation just are too
dark for you but you like the texture
and I think stick foundations are a
really good way to get your makeup on
nice and quick I look nuts and I just
blending that down and then I'm actually
going to swap my brush now second so
this is the Real Techniques contour
brush and it's my favourite under a
blending brush could you get right
underneath make your eye and it's the
quickest good and you can see that I'm
gonna bring the color back and then in
real life I still weird it matches this
lady's nightmare if you didn't know why
I
I can't film for filetes because I broke
more energy like everything else on this
ad my SD idiot
Buddhist bronzer and late medium at this
is my new favorite bronzer I met talked
about it in a video because I haven't
done a video since I got it because I've
been bad and we're going to use this on
my cheeks and I kind of explain it it's
just the best ones I've ever used in my
entire life I like to use just a little
bit gonna say to my dollars and the
brush I'm using as this method one one
eight and like a good half Indian is in
all seriousness for it took five minutes
highlighter okay I'm going to use to tag
at all goody and our new goody so the
first one I'm going to use is the new
Lord of mercy devotion base Eliminator
and this is the latest one and I'm going
to use that on my cheekbones guys you'll
love it mm-hmm
it's so pretty it's like gorgeous so
even though you only got 20 minutes to
get ready you still be the shiniest guy
and the author shiniest guy in the
classroom then I'm gonna swapped a
little eyeshadow brush to get the tip of
my nose
hey good desire Oh
now obviously Laura Marie is not the
cheap hair but the other highlighter I'm
going to use is an old favorite of mine
just find it and I'll clean and our
makeup it's called shuffle the cards
from Topshop and it's just the most
beautiful it's actually an eyeshadow
this is when it was an eye shadow
somehow I use it as a highlighter in a
video in the adult brother is a highly
oh very strange
so I'm going to use this with a little
louver face focus brush I was going to
pop that on top and it goes the most
beautiful can a pinky sheen but it's
like a dual chrome so it's like golden
and then it changed pink it's just the
base you need to go and get it it's only
like eight pounds if I remember properly
now we're going to move on to eyes I'm
going to go in with landlord pimple and
my concealer brush and I just put a
little lately it on all over my eye and
I'm going to go in with my little makeup
palette that I made and I'm going to go
in with this shade here at North LaSalle
a weird one with a sheet here to mattify
my lids doing all over then I'm going to
go in with the shade for rappy and my
crease my buff that shade wrap it
underneath my eyes as well I'm just
going to use the size of my brush to
blend that up towards the brow and
because the highlights already there it
makes it so easy with here and they
diffusion an eye shadow then we're going
with we bit the Kookaburra shade and
just literally put that in the very
crease just because it needs more of and
I've caught blue here at the moment so
called trust to take and eye makeup
that's I'm talking about I'm going to
jump to different state my Tarte is
contour palette and it's the combination
of Sheila and wait one with this color
here and let's just put a little touch
that mmm
snatch that's what she says so I might
say that I'm using her contour palette
and it would put a little bit of mascara
on just now I'm just going to use my
mess happy from L'Oreal waterproof
mascara
nice face so just apply that to the top
and bottom lashes and my favorite trick
quit I don't have much time but I still
want to do Kane a glam me crap is just I
just want like a little false lash on
top and it's like so easy so the last
one is I've already used these twice
excuse the band they are really really
nice they're from Tarte and their their
nuit artist Pro collection this is
really difficult so yeah why I would do
it if I was going to pronounce Sharla I
would just wear this so it's just the
matte soft smokey eye wear with mascara
but if you add a filler lash it makes it
more dramatic really and it takes to
safe ken so I'll just put my glue and
just now and then when I'm waiting for
them to dry and with my brows so I'm
going to use my Rimmel blows s we row
jail and the shade medium brown and I'm
gonna pop that on now
and even if you've got finer eyebrows
you can use this first and then you can
do what I'm going to do in a second I'm
going to use a pencil just to define
them a little bit more and now I'm going
to go in with my bro Peter and it's
urban decay Bray pencil I'm just going
to use the very end like the vivid V tip
of this little pencil just to do a
little bit more sketch in through the
ends my brows just make them a little
bit darker just get them a little bit
thicker and darker towards the ends and
then what you can do if you want as you
can use the very tip of the pencil just
to sketch underneath the brow to make
that a little bit fuller look into two
minute bros what time are we on 19
minutes I'd tell you dad a little good
that doesn't go where those two my brows
my lashes are no dry so I'm going to
shove those on
and all I thing to do is let I don't
know what to do
probably nude okay fill in your a cliff
you've got one that makes you look very
completed I'm going to do the nighthawk
lipliner from urban decay
I'm going to born out or back a 28 Saudi
but it's the neatest brown in brown
innit
I know use Kate a lot the same stuff but
at least you know I'm telling the truth
and what you can do is you can powder if
you would or if you want to be gluey
like knee I'm going to just spray
another little bit face free on top mmm
that's me then I hope you guys like this
look is the quickest I feel like a lady
so I did it in 20 minutes
and if you have your stuff can a lead
out and you know what you're going to be
using you would get it done quicker for
sure but I am there's some tapes you can
mess out as well like lashes you don't
need to do that especially if you're
going to school or work when it comes to
lipstick you don't need to develop play
on it you can just shove on the lipstick
there's a few things that you can do to
save time but I think this is the can
almost put together look that you can do
super quickly
sorry I just looks like my Haley again
so I really like this look it's super
simple it kinda reminds me of one like
act like a Kardashian can it inspired
look and I hope you guys like this
