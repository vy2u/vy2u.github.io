I am going to show you how to do this
entire makeup look so lately I've been
totally inspired by like the main news
babe from makeup obviously this is not a
pity we can't this is not like true to
the time or anything like that this is a
very much 2017 spend on a nineties
makeup so this is like what you read and
quite a lot lately if I go to look I
suppose and I see you guys a sense it is
kind of loose especially when I'm
vlogging and things like that you guys
are going to asking for tutorials on a
makeup look so here it is
if you would like to see how actually
it's a slip stitch in my rod I'm such
hate D Hulu let's get started the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my Kiehl's daily reviving
concentrate you guys know this we're
gonna take four drops of that sort of
into our hands and we're going to place
that all over now that's going I'm going
to be using my Bing team bronze by the
SD edit I'm not sure if you're still on
you should before but I have been using
a clear better new lace and it's
basically like a hydrating glow
moisturizer primer I'm not pretty sure
but I really do like it so it's quite
like a tan color but when you rub it n I
just get the most beautiful glow to your
skin so I like to use underneath a
foundation and also by itself I wouldn't
buy yourself an elderly and I reser
because it kind of like orbit apart to
not wear makeup and I was like well I'll
just shut this one because Ted Clinton
on makeup I got quite oily you have
something on your skating eyes like in
the air too but I just like to use this
all over I put it right into my hairline
and you don't need too much of it woman
right I'm gonna go straight in with my
pigments tech versus the iconic London
pigment stick which is basically like
this foundation stick that does
irrational keep my superior in so this
is too much commitment and it's a little
tiny retouch dark for me now on fashion
eye and please do more
I'm just going to use it anyway and then
I'm going to highlight it switch to the
color and I like to use my oils and
things like that
underneath spec foundations the cause I
wasn't to be really do you know now I'm
going to take my buffer brush from
ICONic that is usually cool handheld
like it's like this in your palm perfect
idealistic it'll actually just blend
your foundation and like two seconds and
another thing I've used this brush for
and putting makeup on my body so if
you're like highlighting your chair or
anything like that it's amazing for
putting makeup on your board you add a
little bit of tomato sauce criminals so
I'm gonna bring that so manic trash is
fine please peel see and I before we
start to warm up the face I'm going to
actually use concealer so I'm going to
use my Maybelline it is her daddy and
she like you guys know I really like
this stuff simply make sure got tons of
products a bit much
we gonna be highlight and then I'm just
going to blend the concealer with my
Beauty Blender to strengthen that on the
skin
I absolutely love that word pen same
painting on the skin princes and I'm
going to use that concealer just a tiny
bit more coverage looking good that is
looking like a nice base now I'm going
to take the Pegman stick and shave D
point through to do some cleanup
contouring I'm going to do with all the
usual kin a spot
come we'll start off little and then go
better so if you've got that much fun to
say I'm going to take the sculpting tool
brush and we're just going to use that
to gently blend we do that seamless I
think it blames these little toys these
brushes are like this softest and then
I'm just bringing that concert slightly
up my cheeks
once it's all blended as you feel like
you're going all over to Ozone like I
have you just grab these lands are are
even your buffer brush and you sweep
that way perfect
so we're looking super glowy never have
to say it a little bit of makeup
otherwise especially you couldn't slip
about all day so I'm going to take my
pr4 in one face mineral makeup Andy
she's late turn I've been using this
non-stop I've actually hit the pan if
you look physical state I were just
going to say amethyst pays are a few use
circular motions add a little touch
coverage as well which I like so it's
something elaborate this look is that
it's not as contoured as my usual it's
more just and kind of natural bronze so
I'm gonna go in with my NARS Laguna
bronzer exciting to my new one until a
it and would work with my Charlotte
Tilbury blusher brush actually but it's
a perfect bronzer brush and I'm just
going to warm up my entire face and when
right over the cream contour forehead
and I were super bronze I'm going to
crap my eyesight with the lingual pay
pot by Mac my one love from the one true
love I'm going to call my kick that
little leg little downloaded and I just
used the top of my beauty blender to
pack sour orange because a goal-line
really nicely
it doesn't call to cakey it's just like
just the weight of it of product so sue
me win well I'm just going to correctly
take my Christ pager over my eyelids say
every time and I'm just using so please
talk just to make sure all that creamy
products getting really pushed in there
looking at these guys come on asleep
I'm just going to show you one blow and
I'll show you the difference rate this
tutorial is going to be flippin full so
I'm going to take a silly brush through
my eyebrow and I've been trying to draw
them in lately so they are a lot busier
than normal which I'm raising and the
thing with I kind of name is fume Dubrow
is you want it to be pretty pretty sick
so I'm going to actually start at the
front get outside and nice and low zone
and then I'm just going to fold a
natural shape and then we're going to
extend the grill a little bit as well
and then we'll do the same thing on top
I'm just going to start about a
centimetre end and I'm going to border
in a natural shape maybe just slightly
outside an actual shape when I 1000d I
hide a kind of reference image so
basically just googled name is
supermodel makeup and it came up with
the exact look that I was like lake as
you know I mean so you can see the
consolidator just stuck her I'm gonna
slightly darken the end and I'll
crazy-looking is what I'm like too much
 to them obviously back then people
didn't like trip Carver's of roses you
know I mean I'm going to take my brain
mascara no this is an issue why I'm not
going it's a Dorothy shade
Christmas
and then taking that product rate
through and then I'm just going to take
a little flat brush and I'm just going
to lightly pave you up
I'm not got any products on it I
literally just wanted to get rid of that
little smudge and that for me is fine so
you can see the substrate and it doesn't
take long at all because the words of
them are foundation so I wouldn't pop
off camera and do less to this exact in
two seconds now I've got my bro's on I'm
actually going to quickly save my face
with the urban decay d slick makeup
setting spray this is the oil control
one so we're just going to totally to
set that makeup and then I'm going to go
in with my Beauty Blender enter my P
raposo I want to say just the the most
oily or videos rather really works
I thought uncle' variable individual and
I've never tried that let's get into the
eye makeup which is totally some color
actually is really easy from winning
into brand new tart
cle-cle 50 pink palette obviously these
are eye shadows up here and then you've
got your contour shades down here but
you can also use these shades to
highlight it's a multi-purpose palette
but we're gonna use those and I'm
firstly going to set the whole lid with
the color side and then I'm going to
start building up the crease with stone
because I'm going to keep it pretty cool
tool and today because I am such a call
for the warm colors not today so I'm
just going to end with the light shades
bloom of the shapes on my trying that
right down and then we're going in with
that color stones I'm gonna buff that on
to the list firstly and then carry
around the crease because once again OS
was making me cup as the daughter house
bugged water eyes at all it's like
really focused on the crease and that's
pretty much it for taking everything
I've got to not start glint and we up
and remember guys
period make up this is not that is are
CarMD spend on a negative makeup and
it's not the Canadians grunge makeup
it's more like a more like the
supermodel makeup that's what I serve
now I'm going to take my Sigma e-40
seven with the shade stone again and I'm
going to go right underneath my lash
line right into the coroner and then I'm
going to buff that out with my Mac two
to four as always for the quick run Jim
and I went to install on the leg of used
to eyeshadows so far I'm going to take a
tiny little grasses of smack two four
seven and when when Messiah shade
solstice which is the latest color and
I'm going to do that underneath my brow
the world apparently in the nineties and
it's just going to help that crease
color it blends really nicely too I'm
going to go and all over the list with
the shade and sticks just here it's
still quite dark but I need something to
mattify and I do want it to be super
bright no way to go and do mascara and
lashes and we're going to see her Raluca
I've got an eight French six or my Lily
lashes in Miami or these not so large
and in a mascara I'm using right now as
my pure silly charged mascara F fabulous
I'm on such a mascara hate right now I'm
veins and all the good ones so I'm going
to build up these lashes super chunky
okay I'm just going to glue up these
lashes declared I'm using I've always as
my dual blue with the green rating
ignore her grubby that says oh yeah
we're going to glue these up then pop
along well I'm waiting for my license to
Dre I'm going to lose my Charlotte
overly potent sculpt brush and I'm just
going to go down the size or mine horns
and that's nice blinders kind of perfect
because it's actually not too warm so if
you remember like my Mac gave me sunup
put an orange twinkle on so I'll make
sure that it's all kind of patted away
nor Crazylegs at any sense but it tastes
like skip just wait and hear as well so
just kind of set them on for a sec and
then the heat of my oil can start to dry
the glue even more so they're not
perfect just now but when they start to
dry a little bit more that's an aquarium
I squeezed let's do it let's next we're
going to see highlights for left I'm
going to use the Rimmel lip pencil in
the shade cappuccino and we're going to
go right on it and I'm going to kind of
accentuate the center part of my lips
there cheapest ball
so this is like the perfect nineties lip
liner because it's a super cool tones
but still like pretty dark groaning it's
and then on top we're going to go in
with the bait because mate ex blondie it
multi stick this is one my favorite nude
lipsticks I'll show you why it's just
perfect
I'm going to put that on all over and
then I'm gonna use my finger just to Pat
it in so that for me is like my perfect
nude lipstick and then know that we've
been that these lashes are ready to be
properly fixed so I'll just use my
little tart lash pill part give them a
little squeeze and that is how you get
can a seamless lashes but you're not
really anyway no no I think it's time to
highlight I'm going to take my iconic
ones and Eliminator job this is a brand
new bottle I ran out of my old one so
this is the original shade I'm just
taking one drop I've learned my lesson
wonder where's my beautiful inside and
we're just going to hit the highest
point for the cheekbones and I'm going
to cut just as tiny ously touch on the
animals and that is it our male said one
ball of these like that muscle a
stimulant nearly a year and I used it
like all over my body
all the time it's clearly the stuff
lasts for ages but it just gives me most
beautiful glow to your skin it's
stunning and now I'm going to do a teeny
tiny touch of the Too Faced love late -
traffic highlighter as SSD shades
blinded by the light and we're going to
get some on the brush I'm just going to
say at that glow and if we're going to
do exact same thing it does the center
of the nose I'm using my dose of color
shader brush this is such a good brush
for nose highlight and because it's
sauce then can get that really pretty
line just understand a little over ten
Randle's
perfect I'm actually gonna highlight my
record I'm going to keep it kind of
darker now all that's left to do is be
you tomorrow so I'm going to take my car
buoyancy mathematics blown lip liner I'm
going to do my usual little shred
cultures here just a kind of theater
wine and then I'm going to do a fair
color at the size of my lip as well and
then I'm going to keep my bro grounds
I'm just going to walk it over a little
bit I hope you like it

was lower but I just thought that
