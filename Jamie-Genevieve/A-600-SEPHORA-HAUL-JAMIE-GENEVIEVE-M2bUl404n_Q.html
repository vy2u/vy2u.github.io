know how I'm sitting they can do judo
today I thought I would just a little
haul or a big haul
I was recently in the States I am still
slightly jetlag this is the first time
I've done my makeup and I've actually
liked it since I've been back so that is
what we're doing today we are going to
go through my supporter purchases from
when I was wait I went to Sephora two
times and I dropped some serious dope
obviously if you don't know others guys
in the UK do not have support yet don't
ask me why
completely men in my in my opinion
basically I bought a bunch of stuff and
I'm going to show you what I bought so
there's a lot of stuff to get through so
there's some stuff I'm not going to go
into too much depth some stuff I've not
tried yet some stuff I have some stuff
is repurchases so let's just get started
the first thing I'm going to go through
is I've got a fat stack of face masks
now the first ones I'm going to show you
are Sephora own brands they are actually
really really good I've got a green tea
eye mask here these are great for when
I'm on the plane and stuff like that
green tea is relaxing and refreshing so
I love an under eye mask this is the
charcoal nose strip the charcoal no
structure basically those things you put
on if you get hard and you pull them off
and it peels out all your blocked pores
with it not try this affordable in brand
but I will and I'll let you know how it
ends next we've got the anti-aging and
smoothing orchid face mask these are
just sheep mask obviously it's a super
easy to use nourishing and appealing
avocado face mask and then lastly we've
got the anti fatigue and energizing a
pomegranate face mask so I really like
these they're really affordable a finger
six dollars each or something like that
and yeah I'm just I'm just a fan okay
next I have a bubble sheet face mask
this is from Glenville not trying this
one before the ones I usually use are
from rodeo so this is the glam cool
bubble sheet oxygenating deep cleanse
mask really like these for whom our skin
is feeling pretty congested and their
friend because it makes you feel cool
all bubbly I got two products from
bullsháá
dunno if I'm saying that right boss yeah
one of which is the sake
main hydrogel mask really like these try
the other one before I think it's the
charcoal one they come in two pieces and
it's the jail and there's Britain's
firms and hydrates cheap masks are great
I try and do at least one a week to keep
my skin feeling vibrant and fun and then
this one from Basquiat is not a face
mask it is a foot mask and these things
are crazy you put it on and basically
exfoliate softens and smoothes peels the
skin off your feet one step to peel and
reveal B be smooth feet so I just was
really interested in this because I like
a gimmick so on the back it says D 1 D 4
to 6 and then D 8 so it looks like on
day 4 to 6 that's when your feet start
really peeling kind of gross but you
know I'm up for anything and then I
picked up two dr. jart
rubber masks I've got the clear skin
lover which is here and what you do is
this little thing up here you pop that
open you put it all over your face and
then you place the jail or rubber mask
on for 30 to 40 minutes so I've got it's
clear skin lover which tightens and deep
cleanses pores and then I've got bright
lower visibly brightens the look and all
the uneven skin tone I'm going to try
these out next products aren't the silly
little oil that's like stuff that you
just need so I packed up these do all
cotton swabs these are just loads and
loads and loads of cotton taps q-tips
corn boots whatever you want to call
them and they're really really small so
I just thought it would be good for
makeup and also that in a really funky
little case so I was sold by that I
picked up a new dual glue this is my
favorite lash glue as latex free and you
paint it onto the lash with a little
kind of brush that comes in and for me
it just keeps your lashes on all day
ot I picked up a Sephora one brand
sharpener it's got the large bit and
small but I've already got one of these
really really good I always lose
sharpener stuff expert
on makeup sleep so remember the trend
for everyone was using tape to get
really clean lines and their makeup this
is basically that but me for doing
makeup so I just thought it would be a
bit safer
so you know whenever you know know maybe
I'll start doing that again so I just
thought I'd pick this up just to try out
some more licks I got two new lipsticks
one of which is one of my favorites ever
this is beta Beauty they're both fake
Beauty this is the multi stick in the
sheet blondie it comes as a super chunky
lip stick tape and it's just one of my
favorite nude lipsticks ever I have one
already and it's run out so I've got
another one and then the other one I got
is the new amuse-bouche liquefied left
now I saw this it's gonna be a liquid
lipstick but it's not it's like with red
lipstick so it's still really really
comfortable and I've got it on right now
it may be one of my new favorite colors
this is called caramelized and the
texture I like the packaging I like the
component a lot and a texture of this is
so gorgeous just a step darker than
blondie I've got it on right now with my
liar lip liner from Urban Decay and I
really really like it super comfortable
these are both 97% natural but basically
means that they're food grade and then
this one I think is even more natural
but it doesn't say enemy love these a
lot love the brand a lot that excite
says this caramelized one may be one of
my new favorite lipsticks in the Ale of
doom which is basically the cute
miniatures I picked up a really cute
little small cuddly beauty elixir this
is just a really gorgeous tree spring it
has the nicest
spree it doesn't like oh yeah it's like
a super fine mess I use this a lot on
flights and stuff like that i use it on
my flight home keep just getting that
super energized smells really really
fresh it's like the first deep breath
you've ever taken and your life so I had
this and a big sized
Ragno and I thought I would just pick up
a little size this time because it's
good for traveling before we delve into
the skincare I go one product which is a
bit luxurious don't really need it going
anyway this is the Tom Ford so little
Blanc
so live long body oil I do have
three Oakland super fresh and coconutty
it's really really somebody and before
the oil smells completely insane so the
idea is that you use the body oil and
the fragrance to have a more
long-lasting perfume experience but I
just really like it Tom Ford is gorgeous
the smells are really really beautiful
as you watch my channel for a little
while you'll know the kind of sense I
like I like super deep Doody this one
isn't easy though Tom Ford the kind of
sense that they come out with I usually
like I've got quite a few there
frequences so I just picked up this body
oil it was not cheap but it was the last
one which made me think it was super
necessary okay no I got a whole bunch of
skin care and some of this was
recommended by Michelle oh one more
makeup product I picked up the Santee
sponge not tried it yet but coach'll had
one could mean push already on this
Chuck together and she said it's really
really nice and it definitely Beauty
Blender oh it's a little bit fresh
basically it looks like a Beauty Blender
from this angle but it's got a flat side
here which course you said is amazing
forget underneath your eyes it's got a
little flat point here what you can
imagine would be good for something
but yeah apparently it's really other
things it feels softer than a beauty
blender and when it's wet as well
especially it's super fluffy and nice
feeling super bouncy so I'm excited to
traders skincare so most of these
products were recommended to me either
by kushell or the Sephora lady or
Samantha so Sam uses this brand here
it's called drunk elephant so this is
the drunk elephant TLC's to carry baby
face show this is the resurfacing
serum and basically I used last night
and I really like it it's just like this
it's like a pump or tote so I took about
two pumps in the back of my hand and you
put an even layer all over your face
leave it for 20 minutes and then you
wash it off and what happens it's pretty
crazy because once you've had it on for
20 minutes I went up to the mirror and I
rubbed my skin and all my dead skin
literally bowled up on my face and came
off so your ornaments use this once a
week you're not meant to you
same time is using any other vet annoyed
but is basically the chemical that like
resurfaces your skin so this is a pretty
intensive product again not cheap at all
but everyone's raving about it so I have
to get it we don't recommend it my
foundations going on so nice today and
what I saw or what I've heard from Sam
is that her scan all her texture is
literally just getting sexed so I'm
lucky I don't have much tape showing
stuff but I do have dry skin sometimes
little areas that I want to work on so
I'm very excited to keep on using this
so once a week that is what's happening
or one to two times a week it says and
I'll be apply it to clean dry skin they
say and I go a little cute oil what's
that it's the virgin Marilla luxury face
oil hydrate and replenish it's only
three males but you get it as a little
say it you get this for free basically
when you buy this because it's so
expensive very excite to try these
something else I've got from drunk
elephant is the TLC from booze glycolic
and they serum I can't use this at the
same time as use in the BBC show when
this finishes and runs out I'll go into
the snow try it but basically this is
like a more gentle version of this so
you just put it on every night before
your moisturizer and it does the kind of
similar thing strips your skin of all
the dead skin cells so what something I
quite like about this brand is that
nothing has a saint it's all quite
natural it's all super natural actually
and it's totally free as well made in
the US
so I'll let you know how I got almost
that's gonna try it the next thing I got
was a replenishment it's Mikey
Somerville eradicate spot treatment a
lot of you guys ask me what I use in my
sports and stuff like that and it's
always this it's just brilliant I
actually picked this up clean I was
hanging it with someone came as well and
I've used ever since so whenever you get
a sport or a blemish you literally just
use a little cotton buds just to get
some of those product and you apply it
directly onto the blemish I usually do
this at nighttime and then by the
morning the blemish is either super can
zone or go fairly good very very good
worth of money this is one of those
products that I have actually used
dupes for an cheaper coffees orbit and
they just don't work as well so this is
one of those
I would probably suggest spending your
money on this product was recommended by
one of the ladies at Sephora watermelon
glow at sleeping masks
I've just seen here it's got a heat and
hyaluronic acid EDG is one of those
things that I'm not meant to be using
when I'm using the BB facial but is a
really cute little tub and yours might
use this at Maine time you can use it
every night yeah you can use every night
so I'm excited to try this but the thing
that made me buy it is this smell it
genuinely smells like like watermelon
sweeties it's really funny texture it's
a jelly and Wow I've actually gone
through that really quickly I'm prepared
on over there got more stuff these two I
picked up not really thanking much and
they're bloody brilliant so this is the
pharmacy green clean makeup melt away
cleansing balm this stuff is absolutely
unreal you apply it straight to your
face it turns into an oil and literally
all your makeup comes off you do not
need to double cleanse with this most
cleansers do see you should use them
twice to make sure that all your makeups
off and all the dirt is off your skin
you just need to use it once I still
take my makeup off with a white face
just because I do require a lot of
makeup and I want it to work the base it
can so I would usually use a weight and
then put this on and then take it off
the warm face cloth and then the other
products are got from pharmacy is the
sleep tight firming night bomb with air
Kaneesha getting envy but basically it's
like a solids
oil that you scoop out apply it to your
skin it melts down to oil oil and is
super hydrate and whenever I wake up in
the morning my skin still feels really
hydrated and bouncy and firm and that's
exactly what I want and I really like
the packaging it's the white ceramic
with the little wooden might finish chic
very cool and the last product I got
which is probably the most extravagant
if I can say that after all this crazy
stuff is the hair before men for it
superfruit night treatment now this
again is one of those products that's
gonna get rid of all the dead skin cells
I'm gonna be really careful when I'm
using all this stuff because I
all exfoliate and it's all forgetting my
dead skin cells off it's all for a big
surface in my skin but I am very excited
to try this cool shell has had it before
and she bought another one she said it's
absolutely amazing this is all you get
and I'm sure it was like 80 something
dollars Oh
does it smell nice no oh and it's gonna
go in a different color on the top but
let's just not think about that this is
what it looks like again super chic
really really cool all these products
that really cool I'm excited to have
them all on my nightstand so what you're
gonna do is this as you put it on before
you go to sleep apply generously to
clean skin massage gently so the minute
its natural butters absorb completely
into the skin you can use it through the
day
but use mainly for best results so you
don't you just put it on weird it must
be good though because it was nearly
sold over to me when we had to leave
scavenge through the drawers to make
sure we could get it on my side and you
cannot get this from Sephora but when
you're using anything like this is so
important to use an SPF through the day
and then obviously the one I use is the
Chi press Helio tropic a little bit of
that goes a long way I think I was using
too much at first but I use it every
single day it's going to SPF of 30 the
type of SPF it's in here is super
natural so because some SPF said I
actually really put your bad for your
skin this is not and I absolutely love
it and I use it underneath my makeup and
it always works really really well so
actually says is sunscreen and primer
it's bronchitis which I get from Co PT
so really recommend this when you're
using any products like this but I'm
really really excited about basically
changing the skin and having a whole new
face
apparently that it's what I'm going for
so that is that you guys that is my
Sephora haul like I said we do not have
support out here so when I do go to
Sephora I do purchase quite a lot don't
get confused this is my job if you think
I'm completely crazy for spending this
much money on skincare and stuff like
that just know I do the legwork to make
sure it's good before you guys buy at
the moment the things that I would
really recommend are definitely be Kate
Somerville this baby face she'll I'm
really I'm pretty sold on even though
only use it yesterday from all the
reviews that I've seen everyone's saying
it's absolutely insane so don't be
surprised when it sells out and then I
really really really loves to sleep
tight firming night balm because I
actually really wanted a nice make him
because I don't actually use appropriate
cream I just use a moisturizer so that's
it
something came with a nice little spoon
to normalize so you guys I hope you
liked this little video or just
something to ease me into forming again
after my trip this jetlag has killed me
this time around I have been not myself

very room stealing at the mace that is
my beauty room and tried to try to
slowly but steadily clean and it's
horrific the rumors tell me please do

videos like these if you like holes and
things like that please do also let me
know what time the law what you would
like to see from me from now on
