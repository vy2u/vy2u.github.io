I'm going to go through this entire
affordable makeup look so pretty much
everything I've used is more high street
or more affordable that you can find
online I don't ask you guys one of my
latest videos before are your favorite
drugstore product and I'm gonna call it
in a list of things that I would go and
get and I mean the time and you would
like to see how I created this like
speeches fun fact did you know that I
have to get this mug made because I've
got a boy's name and I want a little
much sunshine and it says Jamie on it -
Jamie's a boy's name and the UK but my
favorite mug I've had it since I was a
little porky furrow start with her eyes
that's going to be mostly drugstore
obviously but their stomach products I
have not yet saying that works for me as
good as high-end so I'm going to be
using a Canaanite remorse a drugstore
but the first thing I'm going to use is
my laying low Paint Pot just cause I
feel like it's really important to get a
good base especially when you are
working with drugstore shadows obviously
the pigment is great and the shadows I'm
going to use but I just feel like I want
to make sure I've got a really good base
on there and I've yet to find a good
drugstore eyeshadow base so I'm just
using those leave a bottom to us just to
get that overspray up to my brows so I
break already
because I'm still pretty light my
favourite product and I do her about
like the oh she was wore down there good
night on my eyes well I do like the next
red pencils oh yeah I'm still further in
there Mike I just used my usual blood
products today and get the most camera
cause this tutorial would then be 30
minutes long
okay once I have clicked my eye the
palette I'm going to use and the next
blog contours all palette and it's
really beautiful and you've got your
snail shadows in the middle
you got your cuticles your shades these
are shirt or grey colors I didn't use
you today and then you've got your
highlight so you've got a Goldy
highlight and then you've got more of a
kind of pink pedal and highlight so I'm
gonna go in with this color if you're
fresh and say it my life first first and
foremost I'm not
rush I'm gonna warm it up you lift eye
shadow color and the palette you can see
the late shadow a crusty pigmented so
it's brightened up my leg quite a lot
but you're taught Spain for obviously
we're going to go pretty dark pretty
dark on the old guy shuttle so for my
eyes I'm actually going to not use these
discs I'm going to go in with this corn
clear shape first and we're going to
build up in the crease and just use as
much macro runs a quick blow on it
I'm just using a cosmetic two-seater
brush and we're just going to start
building that color up and exceed what
is the quantity Rasheed exactly not all
really warmed by late care or I've been
using it in my crease when I reach for
this palette and it blends really nicely
backwards and forwards like usual
focusing it most on the trees and then
just using the side of my brush just to
kind of blend up towards the concealer
underneath my brows now I'm going to go
in with the other contour color just
here and I'm going to do the same thing
it's going to go in my crease again
and I'm not blending it quite a time
because this color is obviously darker I
do really like the next shadows but one
thing I will see if you get quite a lot
of Fallout hence why I'm doing my
foundation last also little ghost clay
diet for dramatic so it just makes sense
to do foundation last on this key and
then I'm actually a bootable and a
coroner and I'm just going to start
building that absolutely as well now I'm
going to go in with the shade here it's
kind of like a nice warm plummy putco
we're when with my to do for it from
zoeva and I'm going to slowly but surely
start building that up in the air a
corner I feel like the Pegman could be a
wee bit stronger than this one but even
though it takes a little bit longer to
build it up you can still get a really
nice chunky color but it is a really
beautiful shade and then I'm actually
just going to bring that right over into
the crease obviously this brush is a lot
smaller you can get rate and exclus and
clear that day I'm just going to do this
all Wow blackness that can fit me on so
I'm just going to get to my cellar while
start one a little cotton pad I'm just
going to clean that up to side so that's
really a program in and then if you need
to
can I help the blend goal a little bit
just make sure the dip back into your
original transition shade and then that
hilt can I blame any darker colors now
I'm going to go in with the shade here
it more of my cool toned purple and we
went Westby wheeler 2 to 4 again
I'm going to build that up in there a
coronary and carry that on and to
decrease I'm actually equal to just pop
that one and letter coroner as well
start getting at a sport late and again
I'm going to go back in with the
original transition shade and just dial
that back a little bit and I'm going to
build up that really dark cool purple
cool tones kilt or a pulse and just pop
that back and cheese now I'm going to go
end with the next single shadow and
rosedust this is one of the aposematic
shadows really really play and look at
this look really good pigment and
whenever one with my finger with that
and just pop that into the spotlight
then when I boiling it with the glitter
glycerine next as well this is great if
you see me use the two feet square of
glue then you'll know that I really like
that one as well but this is pretty much
it's essentially the same thing but much
cheaper and when it just goes my finger
with that wheel I've actually mixed it
with the prismatic shadow and I'm just
going to place that on and that means
you get a reemployment intense color
with the shadow as well and learn I'm
going to go in with a little touch of
the the Royal glitters from X is real
and that's that's really good under
supply that another makes it look super
shiny and just like to be praised then I
actually on the other eye for eye bed
and I really liked it and went back in
with the prismatic shadow to show you
one and I just cannot use my finger on
top again and it kind of dialed it back
a little bit actually but it's really
it's really really really gorgeous now
I'm going to go in with the dark purple
shade here and I'm going to smoke right
under my eyeball I'm just using Mozilla
two two for today
this is pretty messy I'm just going in
with the first pointer transition shade
and just connect Dustin out and then
this is real just to dial it back a
little bit and then I'm squaring the
retouch more pain for the way know
you'll seen it on Twitter or Instagram
or forever I've been really really
loving the next epoch a cleaner and this
is just in black and it's a really good
juice for the Kat Von D - brilliant
it's what the same kind of felt tip
brush tip so it's gray it's just what I
want I'm not hugely keen on as fun
and the kind of spongy felt tip liner
suggests the cause I don't know
instantly and I'm going to start an
inner corner and just suddenly all over
and we wing it right out now if you look
on I was right to the end of my brows
I'm going to copy that another fade and
I'm not you're worried about underneath
because I actually cleaned it up with
eye shadow as well and then I'm just
going to go from the tail of the wing
and drive it back now I'm going to end
it with a small more fake in five or
seven brush this is a great little brush
for detail and then we're going with the
dark purple shade again and it's going
to really smoke my lower lash line into
this way and then that means that I can
clean it up and that way you've got a
really smoky lower lash line good night
and that way and then something I did on
the top which I really love doing it's
my favorite thing to do with the wing is
I get the black shadow my styler same
little M 5:07 brush where my crease
meets the way I'm going to smoke that
end with Lords of black eyeshadow and
this black eyeshadow is pretty great
considering the price of this palette
look at that followed that's a jeweled
curved silver bear cage that's off quite
good and I'm just going to drive that
black into the crease a little bit now
we're going to move on to mascara play
on my lashes drying out of the last days
I'm not actually using a drug to relax
just the cause lashes are something I
feel that I would rather can spend a lot
bit more money on and obviously you do
get good drugs for lashes like I know
the islur have quite a lot and eat nice
can I still sit and thing is something
I'm going to be looking into a little
bit more black eyes I'm going to use a
global trend line flashes from lovely
lashes obviously to profile for us
because you can get one
beautybay so I'm just going to pop my
glue and I'm using the house of lashes
glue nice really good really strong and
I thought I'm Yoona siding and the Pro
Shop indoor mascara from Maybelline I
got given this in a PR book and today
they're actually the first day of China
that prettiest little brush I'm not sure
about it to be honest that people are
actually packed on my makeup up because
we're hopefully going to be moving soon
or definitely moving soon a little body
where we're going to be moving actually
great clear actually clearly doesn't got
up it gives you nice long soak black
lashes and the brush even was weird
safely at your lashes really well
tonight quit like that it's really easy
to do your bottom lashes with gel
Calicut and again I've actually a few
glasses a couple of times so I'm just
going to go over the little last bag
with my black eyeliner thank you to our
face makeup on are - no pain meds are
lost and the box is a makeup so I'm not
going to actually be used in one I've
moisturize my face with my Kiehl's
moisturizer and I'm just going to put a
tiny little touch of master
extraordinaire is from Maybelline onto
my cheeks just - can I get more of a
ghoul it's really dark it's really dark
so nice I'm going to use as the
Maybelline marks and poreless as a semi
foundation and I really really like it
I'm going to go on the back of my hand I
do use a fair bit and I'm just going to
do my little dots I really like this
shoot I feel like the foundation might
oxidize a little touch because when I do
this it looks like it would be a nice
match or maybe we were too late and then
when I'm finished it kind of looks kind
of looks a little bit and a little bit
turn actually a so journalist it's a
confrontation on and I don't normal why
I like it so much but I just feel like I
really nice even coverage when I do that
and even though it takes a lot but it
came to dot the foundational and I feel
it's really like no time at all to
Blizzard the random videos FV heavenly
skin CC + perfecting brush it's the
estimated crush
ad to display kit for foundation in
general and I have to bring this over
lick because like I said it was a little
bit more time I don't really like this
trendy so I think it's a really nice
coverage if anything I will probably
have even more of coverage but it
definitely does a check with concealer
if you are going to add color though it
was it was pretty warm when it's on is
probably my favorite drugstore
foundation moment once I'm going to go
and missing Maybelline
amines are I that's a is a really fat
concealer you'll see me use a few pains
before because the foundation is just so
me touch warm for me to just use it
pretty much everywhere so the foot the
crisis and then I'm just going to blend
and I'm going to fight when you use my
little Urban Decay diffusing highlighter
brush and then I like to just bring that
concealer right under my eyes that's a
really nice brush to blend this
concealer
and not only does that can I add light
to my face but also I just a little
touch more coverage as well which is for
I'm looking for now I'm just using a lot
of the leave out luxe crease brush with
pretty much no products on it to just
diffuse the concealer it's for my eye
shadow meets it tonight and we're
contouring my face using the lighter
shade first of all and give my little
Charlotte Tilbury corn to brush I will
just start and right in the back of my
cheek and working are we doing I
actually really like the color of that
and then just using my foundation brush
just to tap it back a little bit
obviously I'd like you to Poteau one
because I drink powder usually but also
I've not really framed a texture when I
really like so I decided not to use one
but it will back in with this color
again if it can't close and hit that in
the back from a cheap rate but then I'm
going all usually says late sophomore
four head blend that down a little bit
and then just under my chin so I only
has one and then I'm going to use the
same brush and just a quick sweep and
then carve out just the top of my brow
it helps my launch of the globe it's
Lema actually and then the cream is a
little bit it's underneath mine as well
one thing I feel like I need to do
sometimes as I've done my blows before
our foundation is just go through them
again with some gradual so if I'm really
excited about it and I got a lot of
compliments on it when I posted a
picture when I was using it is that
highlighter here so I actually use this
one and then I put a tiny little bit bit
of the gold one on Israel just to kind
of give it a little bit more warmth I'm
just going to use my fan brush from dose
of colors to start applying that I just
go in a couple of times and I give it a
rub and she glow and then I like going
up obviously and just do it can I sort
Oh CRS is really great and if you
imagine you could use that color is this
portly in your eye makeup that would be
really play as well so between my finger
and apply that in different minerals and
pass it back a little bit and I'm going
to have to put a little bit then run off
when you line it with this brush you
know and see if that makes a difference
it's easier to get into the product
anyway very go
ignore the fine brush idea and then we
warmly gold one on top I think actually
known for lip color I'm actually going
to go in with the shade down-home beauty
which is by next and I'm going to line
my lips which is a kind of nice can a
darker Brown but I would really really
blame dead
starts feeling my lips I'm just going to
pass it back a little bit help blend
that length and Tamila I'm going to use
the more feet liquid lip obviously
that's technically as a drop of it is
super affordable and I don't actually
how it is kind of cool for more face to
look over that but I'm sure some of your
other youtubers have one refused so
nipping is little silk so that that does
the shade for Jim it's most foods of
color and their liquid lipids little is
my favorite color and our liquid
lipstick range and I'm just going right
up to the connect darker Brown lip liner
and I'm going to hold it and they look
like lipstick I just like the top and
then with my friend right and I would
have to clean off a little Pearson so
you guys that is the finished look I
hope you really like that and I really
want to create more of a connect on
junior can I go in a style makeup using
more affordable products you guys know
that I'm slowly but surely building a
collection of all my favorite can I
drugstore affordable product so in keep
an eye out for more tutorials like this
