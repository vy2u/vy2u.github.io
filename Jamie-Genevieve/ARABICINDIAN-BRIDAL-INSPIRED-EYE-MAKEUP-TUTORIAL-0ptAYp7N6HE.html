I'm going to show you guys how to do
this super glam kinda Arabic slash
Indian bridal inspired Anika I was a
bigger market for a long time and I had
a few Pakistani and Indian clients and I
was always so excited to do her makeup
the cause is really dramatic and as
really fun and for a makeup artist to do
that as the most makeup I've worn my
face and a long time and I feel like
Hale
I love it so yeah I'm really inspired by
the style of makeup that comes with
Indian Brazil I'm doing it in a way that
suits my really Scottish face I will
have a beautiful almond eye shape so I
kind of try and create that using shadow
techniques and Lena and things like that
so this is further ado if you'd like to
see her actually is that I look station
fine let's get started the first thing
I'm going to do and grab my Lea little
Paint Pot by Mac you know I love it I'm
going to keep my Beauty Blender and just
take it Azir and pack this primer on all
over really into the no corner as well
youtubenation smooth and national pick
I'll have such my poster week salud make
sure it's nice and sex but not too crazy
and maybe not create photo here as well
because obviously our blames quite long
once I thought I'm going to go in with
my pure light tan pressed mineral makeup
this is just a payment over the lake and
win a powder that down quite a lot
just take your mouse mess 1:1 to these
new ones and putting it down the power
that I've used to be is the hood of UK
textured shadows palette the rules board
Edition I use quite a lot of colors on
this but I'm also going to use some milk
advantage just to help blend out because
this palette is beautiful but I don't
feel like it's the easiest thing to
blend so I do need something else to
help me to the first sheet and we're
going with is strand always just here
and we're going to start building up the
crease and I'm just going to do
normally I'm going to look straight
ahead into my meadow and use my Mac so
two four and I'm going to start building
up and I'm bringing that quite far and
decrease quite far and Sandra corner and
then we're going to use the side of the
brush just to start to ring their face
now this is where I kind of struggle to
get it blended another fades to be
honest I'm going to use the shades blur
from the milks mythic stack I'm going to
start using that very sage just to blend
that out I'm going to keep the calendar
there to say slightly the Leighton seems
feel a little bit funny to you guys and
then I'm just using that blur shade just
right over if we're not blended just to
help get that smooth transition now I'm
going to ball end to the shades panel
just here I'm going to start blending
that into the crease ultra and I'm
bringing that enter that in my corner as
well the defense with best look and my
usual looks as if you look here the
shadows blended quite far onto the lid
so I'm going to cause my eye over and
start to bust that onto the legs just
here so instead of seeing it stain on
the crease where can I move an on to
shoot that's part by who want it to be
super smoky I know our core and are
coming in and then I'm just going to
blend that Hannah shade right into the
crease and to the inner corner and I'm
kinda picking up water products then
packing on and then using the size of my
brush just to blend out and don't be too
worried about coming down here because
we're going to clean all that up Leona
me and I've been super late with my
brush and just using the kind of fade or
the brush to help blend that a really
below that color date now I'm going to
change over to the semester to 30 brush
and I'm going to use the shade coral
which is just here so needs can a dark
gray and we're going to start blending
that into the crease as well so packing
it on in the outer corner and then
bringing out enter the truth
just taking our time to build up that
Dex making sure we're coming on to the
light a little bit and then making sure
it's native lingo and again I'm going to
drag that under here we're going to
clean that up enemy and then I'm just
going back in with my Mac two to four
just to help blade though it's always
good to move on to fluffier brushes even
after adds into kind of darker colors
now I'm going to go end with the shade
monitor just here it's a really
beautiful pen even though you don't see
too much all of it it does add that
cannot warmth to the eye look it does
make a difference
I'm just going to bring that onto the
lid here this is really thin a corner to
be nice and bright
now I'm soaping into my two to four
brush by Weaver and I'm going to go in
with these black truffle which is just
the black eye shadow and the palette I'm
going to start building up that or a
corner so I'm really stamping on that
black shadow and then I'm buffing that
down again because we're going to clean
up the enemy and then I'm going to bring
that just onto the legs super close to
the lash and then I'm going to bring
that up into the crease just a little
bit so still creating that v-shape and
then again just blending that out with
my Mac to toothbrush any fluffy brush
will do but you guys in order L love
this brush I'm using the warmer colors
from doing the transition shades just to
help blend that black onto the lid on
the light I'm just going to take the
shade bead which is just a really nice
late matte shadow and I'm going to bring
that from the inner corner onto the lid
and that just keeps everything nice and
matte but I also add some light into the
makeup now I'm going to take the don't
do C DOS
I do not know it spelled do C II from
Kat Von D I was just at event this
morning and I picked this up it's one of
the metal crush eyeshadows and I'm going
to use my
I know somebody used my zoeva 54 this is
just a kind of classic eyeshadow brush
and I'm going to pop that and this edge
of that look at that pigment man and we
put that into centered as I just wear
the black cannot blends into the lid so
then I'm going to take the heavy metal
glitter and deseed Midnight Cowboy by
urban decay and then I'm just going to
use this right on top of that shimmery
eyeshadow and then I'm going to Pat that
and with an eyeshadow brush now I'm just
kind of looking at both my eyes seeing
how darkness gone and I'm going to add a
little touch more black just an outer
corner before we did Elena so just pray
in there a corner and then I'm going to
bring that all into the light a little
bit more the lens all that out with my
fluffy brush and D shade Hanna and it's
warm torn let's clean this up and see
her lookin so the way I do this is I
just grab a makeup wait wait for news at
the moment are the next be gone makeup
wait they're pretty strong I don't know
if I would love using up all of my face
all the time but they're really good for
this kind of thing and I just get my
rave wrap around my finger and I've got
Neil's so I can just use the nail to get
a nice sharp line if you don't have
nails you can use a credit card you can
just put your card in there and use that
but I'm just going to start underneath
my eyes
and that just gives you a super-sharp
Lane be careful that you don't use any
or anything to oily because the oils
will just cannot carry up and start and
mention up your Hawaii channel but
that's a really good way to get a nice
sharp plane without using tip and now
let's Delano
avvocato ng event I also picked up a
brand new super liner so I'm going to
use that and the later I'm going to do
is actually really easy because you've
got that leg to fall all for your flick
and then I'm just going to make it come
out moderately Specht on the top but
Iquitos you got gory into that a coroner
and next look
cool wonderful Elena go into the black
shadow again and I used to do this all
the time but we're going to do is we're
going to smoke and that leaner and
easiest way to do that I just place your
brush and the crease just with the
crease meet Selena and pack on the black
shadow right there and then you can
cannot drag it up and enter the piece
you can blend easily but that for you
want to put your black shadow right on
the outer corner and that just gives the
illusion of superb almondy beautiful
eyes even on little rain petit I'll in
mine
I'm just going to keep on blending that
is really what takes longest in this
look I'm just adding in my panics and my
warm Browns just to help everything
blend together build up that day and
then swap brushes and just go away with
the paint this is just the next 17 brush
at 5 I'm going to go over that painters
in here and then it's something that
really helps blend out just at the great
board is gonna miss a highlight so I'm
going to go in with my melt cosmetics
gold or they just will ductile a fur and
I'm going to highlight my brow bone and
that just helps the braid would
obviously pop but it helps blend up
there as well and then now I'm just
going to highlight my inner corner for
underneath my eyes the first thing I'm
going to do advanced is going to
tightline under the waterline of my eye
so the product immune for that is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills waterproof skin
color and Jick this stuff reminds me a
lot of the envelope 17 North 77 black
liner which a few views that you'll know
it does not come off and it's good way
so I'm going to take some of this and
I'm just going to fill in my water right
and then I'm going to tightline my eye
as well which I hate doing very
intrusive and then oh that water is your
pod and then I'm just going to take the
same gel liner and I'm going to do it
right at my inner corner and the tear
duct Jesus that's the source Becky dog
hair in mine is perfect I'm looking
close up and I'm just going to add a
little touch more of the glutes are just
up here while I'm waiting for that to
time I'm actually going to glue up my
lashes these are really old bloody
lashes and the sail can you guys know
demo favorites I prefer these over the
Mykonos lashes know my new feeds and I'm
wore these no joke like 20 times though
at least I'm just gluing them up for a
black tie let's do underneath our eye so
right what we're to do is I'm going to
go underneath my eye with the shade
panel and a little bit of magneto henna
and Magneto and I don't actually have
any product underneath my eye I'm just
going to do it with eye shadow wire with
women a lot that cool cool I like that
was bare and then I'm going to go in
with my tier 2 4 brush that I use as a
black shadow and a pink color and then
they kind of mix together and you get
that smoky pink and then buffing that
out as much a tube forward as you can
see even go back in with your white and
just clean it up again and you can
obviously do that with concealer as well
once you've done that all you have to do
is mascara and lashes mascara I'm going
to use as the Maybelline push-ups in
gels Gado you guys know the elders of it
and I'm just doing an 8 quart of my top
lashes just enough to make them nice and
black and then the bottom lashes I'm
going to try and build up quite a lot
I'm not more makeup like this and so
long and I'm sort saying that all I've
got to do today is go to its furniture
show
that's a license on and our great text
if you're like me and your your lashes
create a law and is once it's on and dry
just go over it the bond with a little
bit of liner and that just makes it
super black you can't really tell if
there's any kind of glue fell on them a
little bit more seamless so you can
pretend that you were born with the best
eyelashes in the planet known eyes are
done I'm actually going to head off and
do my bro and finish the rest of my
makeup because the next video that I put
up you're going to see my entire new
foundation routine so I'm just going to
do that for the champion and I'll be
back in a second and I'll show you the
finished look

bit more intricate it could be a little
bit longer and when you guys set in here
