i am bringing you this look i have
teamed up with Rimmel and I created this
look exclusively for super drunk if you
are n superdrug in the next couple of
weeks you may see my face on the Rimmel
stands it's a really exciting
collaboration there is the slick which i
think is perfect for all more full if
you call it full so I'm excited to get
back into the kind of grungy autumn
winter looks and and yeah there's one
other look that I created for a remote
which I'm so sure you'll see very very
soon but if you would like to see how I
created this entire look then please
stay tuned
you know okay so first thing we were to
do is we're gonna start off with primer
this is the Rimmel Texan perfect primer
and it is the one I use credible Pro
multi-action it does everything it
smooths
brightens three services mattifies
protects all the good stuff obviously
favorite eyelets probably my favorite
drugstore a Marie I'm just gonna put
that all over my face I've already done
all my skincare and a little bit goes a
long way for this primer and I did just
like rubbing it into my skin everywhere
is not particularly mattifying it does
hold friend-ish not all day but it's not
super dry or tacky so I just put it
everywhere now I'm gonna go straight
into foundation I'm going to use the
lasting finish foundation and the shade
400 natural beige this as the comfort
sedum foundation I'm going to take a few
parts in out in the back of my hand and
I think I'm just gonna apply this with a
brush okay and I've used this foundation
of bunch of times and I really like a
little bit goes a long way with this
foundation I took three pumps in the
back of my hand but I don't think I'll
actually need all that it covers up all
my redness I don't know if it's a go
over my lips as well you don't need to
do that and then I'm just going to bring
that day money a Chloe but I like that
color on me if you've not tried this
foundation I really seriously recommend
going enter
a real Kohner and just give it a try
because it's such a beautiful texture I
probably is one of my favorite drugstore
foundations as well that's primer and
this foundation together are really nice
yeah it look fake I feel like I've done
my whole face I've still got tons in the
back of my hand
only maybe start with like one or two
pumps before you go home for concealer
I'm gonna use the wake me up concealer
by Rimmel also obviously and we're just
gonna highlight under your eyes and in
the cone usual center areas
I'm going to use the insta-fix single
just to dump in a sponge this is quite a
good trick and formation you can see
their last ages and not please so it's
good at that and I think this concealer
does Blanes really nicely with the
sponge I prefer using a sponge with it
just going right under the eye that
blends into the foundation really nicely
obviously all these products worked
really well together because they are
all from the same brand so they're all
kind of made to work together I'm
actually gonna put some concealer on my
lids as a primer this is like one of my
new friends that I do and it seems to be
working really well I think it's just
one less product to have in your makeup
bag as well
you know I just totally brains up the
eye and gets it ready for some eye
products I'm just gonna push a little
bit more foundation with my sponge into
the center of my face for a little bit
extra coverage I just like the finish
that this foundation gives my skin and
it's nice - it's not her duty but it's
not as definitely not too matte either
it must be the confer exceed on this and
the foundation that makes it feel like
that mm-hmm
we got a base next I'm going to take the
insta-fix and matte powder this is just
a really nice translucent powder I've
used that a bunch of times and I'm just
gonna take a brush and I'm going to
sweep that just over my eyelids just for
the concealers nice and matte and then
I'm just gonna go under my eyes for the
moment this is the fab powder is totally
translucent and it did light weight as
well even though it's pressed is really
sanely milled so I'm just gonna powder
that much for the moment because we've
got some cream contouring to do for
brows I'm going to be using the blue
this way bro sheep filling Poteau and
this is just a really fine powder that's
super easy to your eyebrows really
really easy and what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to go through my brows you'll
see it just adds a nice
une of depth to the brow it's not too
dark I told the lucra Dunes pretty
dramatic on the lips I'm not too
bothered about having super the same
dark eyebrows I think the whole look
itself
trae strong I just want to make sure
that they're a little bit darker just to
match my hair the color I'm using is
medium brown and the powder just quotes
the here's a little bit but it also gets
rape
behind the ears so what we do this first
I like to make it a little bit darker
just yup I like this color it's not too
warm I don't like how warm breathe
through my brows and then what you can
do as well as you can kind of build up
your arch a little bit so I'm going to
do that but it makes such a subtle nice
deference and it's really quick now
we've done that when you use the clear
brow gel from normal to bro this we
throw Joe and this sets the brows in
place but also kind of diffuses the
powder but I love how this gels like
super thick so you can get your brace
standing nice and straight up at the
front and it just totally looks and the
Sheep all day so even though the Luc
defines are still actually played pretty
natural never saw our brows I'm going to
go in with the enter do contour stick in
a shade medium and we're going to
highlight and contour you get tons of
products in this but when it just starts
to contour so I just put into my usual
cheek contour gel this colors great it's
not too warm but the interior is not too
ashy because if it's too actually it'll
just end up looking muddy and gray on me
I'm just gonna go all the usual spots
cheekbones forehead and I'm gonna go
range my chin
I'm gonna leave my nose I hope for the
moment and if you've seen in my channel
before you'll know that I like to blame
this on first so I'm just gonna use a
sponge and because we've not powdered
the rest of our fascia it creams playing
super
easily if you powdered already and
you're trying to play in these and
that's when it can get a little bit may
say a little bit mucky and you see that
this gives a really nice warmth to the
skin it's like a subtle contour
one of my favorite corn boys from Rimmel
for highlighting as using the highlight
part of the contour stick so I just like
to use the side of this deck
oh so Gorge it's quite subtle but and
the right light looks so beautiful it's
not too much at all
I'm gonna just take that on my nose as
well okay this ball I'm gonna leave my
forehead just now and then I'm just
gonna blend that and with my sponge as
well if you aren't very much makeup you
can stop here for your skin and you've
got super shiny expensive looking skin
and the creams as well be we are really
nicely throughout to do but obviously we
gon be going in today we're gonna go our
wee bit more dramatic driving are those
gorgeous that we're not finished I'm
gonna take the Rimmel natural bronzer in
the shade Sun go and I'm gonna just go
straight on top over the corn cherry
extreme control is done we're just gonna
start to warm up this face and the
bronzer goes on top of the creams really
really easily you guys know that I don't
like to powder my whole face anyway so
it's really important for me when I'm
using products that the Lyra nicely and
they don't go too crazy when I'm
starting to like buff my bronze are into
the cream contour and stuff and then K
can be slightly smaller brush I'm just
gonna run that bronze I don't I say to
my nose right up to the start of the
brow that just gives that nice kind of
skipped quite heard effect and if you
want to meet that look we're not sure
you can just use a sponge to kind of
lock that into the skin
oh I like this to finish this off we're
going to use the Kate scope from Pilate
and number two coral glow and we're
going to use all of these so I'm going
to use the contour first with a little
small contour brush I was going to
slightly intensify the contrary I'm
actually really happy with that right
here I'm gonna go in with my slightly
bigger brush I'm gonna go in with the
blush part and just hit slightly above
the contour and then go onto the apples
of the cheeks a little bit just to warm
the face up that a little bit more and
then remember without the cream
highlight we're gonna go on top of the
cream highlight with this powder
highlight and that's how you get a blind
and highlight as my favorite little
combo my friend products to get that
blend in highlight the powder
highlighter itself as in super chunky
glitter or anything so it goes on top
with a cream really nicely you don't get
any kind of clogged product or anything
and then it's really it's nice to sit
from the front you can't see it it
doesn't have that cast but it's good we
really just do it above the brow just
lately because I just gives that
luminous look to the skin and then
taking a slightly smaller brush I'm just
hitting the North so the end of the nose
the little exclamation mark would do and
then the kiss ball as well so that is
our skin pretty much done I'm good as
Santa just know we're again at the end
start fixing Gore spray this nozzle
gives you a really nice sane mess it's
not one of those sprays that you go it's
nice and then no we've done that I'm
gonna just powder with the edster
effects in my project again I'm just
gonna go don't mass mailings because I
know that Twitter crease and then my
chunks that gets oily and now my friends
is like my perfect skin for JTD or if
you come up perfect for evening then
we're gonna move on to eyes I'm gonna
zoom you in a little bit closer and the
eyes for me is probably my favorite part
has makeup this product here
this is the remote magnifies Jill and
eyeliner is magnifies Julian you've got
two different colors so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to go
in with this color here it's the nice
warm brown color and honestly I was
really excited to film this part of this
tutorial because I just could not
believe how good it was to be honest so
what we're going to do is we're going to
take this and what you're just going to
go all over the peel of score just
obviously you can see that and we're
going to take that right up past the
crease so note on that I'm going to go
straight and I'm gonna do one eye at
time cuz you need to blend this and you
just go over it with the brush pick up
low as a product and then add your using
your brush the product kinda warms back
up and you can blend a son who's going
backwards and forwards with my brush and
it does dry so you have to work a wee
bit quicker but even though it's
metallic
once you start bleeding Dannette you get
this crazy like easy peasy transition
I'm just gonna use my Beauty Blender
just to take that back a step like look
at that look at our color I'm gonna see
if in another day no good I'm just gonna
go in with my brush and start using my
window wiper movements just to start
warming up and in little circular
movements up towards the braid I
absolutely love that it's a really
gorgeous color as well it's almost like
a kind of perfectly braid but I did this
for the photo shoot
everyone can believe that it was just
one product because it looks like a
bunch eyeshadows doesn't it and honestly
it lasted so well because once it says
it says so if you were to do this and
maybe even put with more eyeshadows on
top of it that's not going anywhere
just like that and I'm gonna do the same
thing underneath my eye and then I'm
just gonna use the same brush to blend
that I like I just think that's so nice
once I got to that stage of the part of
the photo shoot I actually said you
could totally leave us here at mascara
nude lip and it's like such a nice
daytime look but I will make
darker so I'm gonna take the removed WOM
eyes palette that says this palette and
the shade golden eye and I'm gonna
actually take the black from this and a
little small brush and I'm just gonna
intensify the outer corner and because
all the pencil that was just buffed out
it's super sticky the shadow was on sole
well and then I'm gonna just slightly go
under my eye on the outer corner and
what that is doing is it's just elongate
in the eye and make it look a little bit
more dramatic and we're doing it right
close to the lash line but they were
also going up and this little v-shape
and then again just go in underneath the
error corner of the eye and then if you
need to you can go back in with your
first buffing brush and just blend that
black then I'm just using the bank
buffing brush just to bring that black a
little bit into the crease
now I'm just gonna take exaggerated
eyeliner and black and we're gonna do a
nice little thin line above our lash
line just on the upper corner just to
kind of where the black has already so
I'm just gonna stop that one and that
way you get the kind of more elongated
eye but your lashes aren't gonna get
lost in the liner and then I'm gonna
stand little dots underneath my lower
lash line so when we put bought mascara
on the bottom lashes look super sick
that's a little tip that I learned off
my friend makeup Sheila before I do
mascara I'm going to use this little
gold shadow in the middle and I'm just
gonna put a tiny touch of that in the
center of my lid with my finger and that
just gives the slight illusion of a
sport like I saw pretty just gives that
a little bit more dimension big one with
that sight now the lights are st. and
I'm just gonna pull up my inner corner
so I draw that one first and the pigment
on this thing so good it lifts it out
for inner corner and then what you can
do if you want a little bit more intense
get a little bit the highlight that we
used earlier and just pull up that in
the inner corner as well this little
duel pencils probably one of my favorite
products to be honest
well I've got my highlight I'm just
gonna highlight my brow bone just using
that highlight shade from the Kate
sculpting palette and highlight and
obviously helps blend whatever is next
to the purple and so that just looks
much more play into it now I'm going to
use the wonderfully real mascara with
nylon fibers this stuff is so good I
love it drugstore mascara so I'm just
gonna take a little bit time to set and
really build up my lashes so once you've
done one quarter go onto the other side
and do one cool and then work my way
backwards and forwards until I've got
super thick chunky lashes and I
absolutely love that eye look I can't
believe that I don't have in any lashes
on and I like it this much for the lips
you totally have a choice either you can
just pair this with a nude lip and it's
a super weird about date night look
depends and on hope all jar so I'm just
gonna pop on these steam liquid lip and
the shade more cracked this is a really
gorgeous nude so I think that itself is
a total finished look I think it's
gorgeous
but we're gonna do double dark today so
we've got dark eyes we're going to do
the dark life as well so I'm gonna take
this off and this was what was on the
campaign image is I'm going to mix these
two colors together though they're both
the steam out liquid lips but when it's
mixed together they're blue iris and I'm
gonna mix together midnight as well
totally up to you how you do this I put
one on top of the other before and it
was totally fine but what I'm gonna do
to make sure I'm just super neat is I'm
going to take it I'm gonna put it on the
back of my hand
so I'm going into the chip and then
going on the back of my hand you do not
need to use the back of your hand you
can use a palette or the top of a
product or anything but as that X is X
makeup artists don't you ever stop me to
recap artist but when I was a makeup
artist I used to always work off the
back of my hand it's just one of those
habits yeah I don't think you ever
shake I put both goes on the back of my
hands and I'm going to use a lip brush
to apply this and it makes the most
beautiful dark dark plummy color and
then I'm just going to apply these with
a brush
now that is double dark the last product
winning is is the lip art left top court
and these are n gorgeous shimmers look
how beautiful that is
I would be sauteing did you just put
that on my face what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take a little bit again on
the back of my hand and I'm gonna pick
that up with my fingers and I'm just
gonna Pat that on his head under the
lips and that just gives the lips such a
luscious like I don't wanna see 3d
effect so obviously I'm 3d I'm a paracin
but it gives the lips a little bit more
dimension it's not as flat it is tis the
season for glitter top cause those
sectors this time will be so garage so
you guys that is the finished look
another thing to mention after you've
been wondering what's on my nails part
of the collection as the Superjail
Dremel polish in the shades Arbonne
purple and then I use the super gel
topcoat on top to make them super shiny
so that is what I've got on my class I
really really hope you like this look
it's super exciting for me I'm very
excited to be part of this campaign if
you do see me over in a boat and super
drunk then please let me know because
I'm absolutely buzzin it be in the shops
but yeah apart from that I will see you
in the next tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
