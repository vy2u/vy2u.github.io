hi guys welcome back to my channel today
I am going to be showing you my
favourite product of 2017 as the names
of journey Lee so I'm not too late I
have been a reborn whale buyback I'm
feeling much better
everything's ok and I thought I would
just do a roundup of my favorite
products for 2017 if you have watched my
channel in 2017 you'll have seen all of
these products I'm not going to go into
them too much this is not a review video
it's just showing you guys for my
favorite products so you know what to
buy I have a lot of stuff here a lot of
stuff so I'm just gonna kind of rattle
through it the first product we talk
about is less beauty right here this is
the nude photography fluid opacity 12%
it literally doesn't say anything else
order is like a primer it's super
gorgeous and beautiful I know that you
guys have sold this product I have and a
lot of websites everyone says it's
because of me this is the best thing
ever I guarantee that I'll wear this on
my wedding day it's like a really
beautiful shimmery primer shuri's maybe
the wrong word it just gives your skin
the most beautiful glow and then when
you put your foundation on top it looks
so flawless and if totally it's
absolutely gorgeous as well I think
everyone should try it
they have different opacities for
different skin tones as well like this
one might look a little bit Ashley on
deeper skin tones they have a tan barish
and I flipped in love this
the next products are I'm basically
going through the things that you guys
know I'm gonna speak about first so the
gifted mascara from tar this mascara is
absolutely amazing I have used it today
I need a new one I love it it does not
crumble at my face throughout the day I
have tasted this it pairs some training
sessions
it does not swear off it does cry off
I'm a crier I cry a lot of things mostly
animal videos on Facebook this comes off
when you're crying but it is really
really good but recently I have been
using this one here this is the Mac
hot and law ha - naughty lash is
phenomenal is the best mascara
for building up really really chunky
feet looking eyelashes and I am over
this one because it's cheaper and it's
easier to get worldwide I think this is
really really great
I think this one is great great great
for building really dramatic lashes I
love it from my bottom lashes you can
use the pink brush to get a really nice
thin layer of product and then if you
twist from the purple section you get a
really chunky fill mascara wands for
building up those lashes this and seeing
me through 2018 I can order to tell you
the next product is a Mac product also
this is dark tan bronzer I used to use
this all the time when I was a maid
forest I used to use that I had my kit
and I've just recently fallen back in
love with it
I know Jews give me Sun throughout the
years we'll which is another shade is
the mineralized skinfinish that is the
contention of the Poteau that is the
formula I asked loved us for bronzer I
liked a lot of bronzer I weighed a lot
of bronze I read a lot of makeup and
that's really really suits I absolutely
love this and I will say that I
absolutely love every product here
because I really do I really really do
next product is shape tape it has been a
while since this came out and there is
nothing for me that has comment let's
match this I absolutely love it
I don't really see much about it it's
from Tarte cosmetics and I would love to
know how many of these have sold since
it launched because as the most famous
concealer in the world
I absolutely love it I used to shave
medium for reference that leads me on to
my next base product this is the why
sale all iris foundation I've been
through a lot of foundations this year
and I got this on a trip when I was in
Morocco with myself in October I doesn't
start using it until about a month ago
because I wasn't the right color for it
now I am this is B D 45 this is my
favorite foundation ever i flippin love
it it is more mad than I usually go for
it by I think it's so gorgeous I really
really really really love it I think
it's definitely worth going and packed
up a sample at least to try it but with
my skin which shows can a normal
combination and set so beautifully I use
all my oils underneath that still in my
moisturizer and it lasts all day again
I've tasted s it personal training
sessions it does not move you may have
heard me mention oils there the Kiehl's
oils I have used for years now this is
the daily reviving concentrate which is
the oil I use in the morning and this is
the midnight recovery concentrate which
is why I use at night sad story coming
up in the last three days I have dropped
both of these balls and see how their
can I have fill they were fill they're a
knife soaked into my carpet there's
worse things happening in the world
every day but it was a moment in my life
that would not like to realize these
oils I use as part of my skincare
routine but I also think that using this
one every single day it makes my
foundation going so smoothly my skin
always looks hydrated always looks can a
glowy and healthy and then the red
negative company it's just fantastic it
keeps my skin really supple and
moisturized throughout the night
absolutely love these I know that there
is a counter in Glasgow that when people
go and get this oil people call it the
Jima geneviève oil I'm not mad that my
name is attached to this product because
I absolutely love it I think everything
that I use a lot these are the products
that I get the most messages about to
say thank you for recommending them
because they just work there absolutely
reason that brings me on to my next
product which you may have not seen me
talk about unless you watch a skincare
video but this is the Kiehl's iris
extract activating treatment essence now
it's at a huge big bottle I use this day
and night and the morning and at night
even before I do any skincare at all
just on a clean face and what you do is
you basically put two or three drops in
your hands rub them together and then
push that onto the skin and that's just
really really helps with any absorption
of your skincare products and makes your
skin it's so much more susceptible to
moisture sore gorgeous and I have been
having I kind of opened
time with my skin over the last few
months I basically scaled back motor
teen a lot I only use this the toils and
a moisturizer and my skin is back to
being really really good I think that
this helps my oils work so much it's not
a thing that everyone says that you need
but I think it makes a huge difference
and your skin cure working and this
bottle you only need two or three drops
more than a night so this'll literally
will ask me you will over a year well
over a year so unreal I love it you hear
that you hear nothing because it's
finished I need a new one this is the
new talent or a coconut tanning water if
you've watched three of my videos you've
definitely seen me talk about this as a
face spray that has tanning agent in it
which basically means that you get a
really really beautiful tanned can a
glow I use this day and night is great
you build up such a nice color on your
skin
honestly it gives you a really nice
natural looking tan you never make
mistakes with that I basically split as
Friday night but I basically split all
over my face and then down my neck and
then down to my chest or this whole area
bronzed all year round I use this like
there's no tomorrow I really really
really really like this as eighteen
thousands it does run out quite quickly
but to look healthy and glowy and tanned
all year round
I'll pay that eighteen points I will pay
that but I do get sent it for PR so
there's that the last face spray I have
is a Mac product this is the sex+ but
it's coconut I think it was literally
like last week or that we could before
Mac have brought back older fix+ cents
so you've got coconut and then here I've
actually got rules and lavender and the
original so they are brought back
permanent which is so exciting I
remember when these scents were released
I notice had flavors when these scents
were released ages ago they were sold
out everywhere it was so difficult to
get them and now they are all year round
so I'm absolutely buzzing the coconut
one is beautiful it smells like holidays
I would take this on hold you with me
just as
raishin spray I think the smell is
beautiful and obviously fix+ is such a
staple item in your makeup bag because
you can use it too late I share those
you can use it to prep the skin for
makeup you can use it to rehydrate
makeup isn't actually a setting spray it
doesn't say your makeup in any way it
just kind of rehydrates everything which
is what I kind of like so I really
really love this I'm actually just going
to quickly mention another product
that's nearly finished which I really
want to quickly mention this is great
for hydration but I do really love the
old mate or say Italy from Urban Decay
the only thing I would say about this is
it's not the base mail but this build
disappears really really quickly and I
really do think that this keeps your
makeup on I think I actually spray this
on my face every single day yeah every
single day and it really does help keep
your makeup on and again you can use
this two way I shower doors and things
like that as well so these are my two
favorite sprees I actually tweeted about
half an hour ago because I had all this
makeup out in front of me but I felt
like I was forgetting something
and I asked you guys what makeup you
think of when you see me what do you
think of and so many of you guys said
Baker or pearl and I totally get it why
because I do absolutely love it but I've
not used in months I've actually not
used it in months I think it's in a
drawer somewhere but vehicle opal is so
gorgeous it's a really beautiful
highlighter
another highlighter that I've actually
lost from the moment that I think is
stunning and the Lauder Gayler gilded
honey that highlighter it's so beautiful
and so shiny but the one that I am going
nuts over right now is Mac or darling
again this is a product that was really
difficult to get your hands on when it
came out at first I have never had it
before
until now I was done shooting with Mac
in London and they had one for me
because they know that I wanted it it's
what got on today I think it's the most
gorgeous highlighter right now the way
the products pressed as well I've been
using this a lot and it looks like
nothing is really going
nothing nothing usually be picked up so
I feel like this is a really
long-lasting highlighter I think the way
it shines is beautiful I use on my body
a lot and I really like
as well I'm so happy that this is my
life man I think people would be pretty
disappointed if I then mentioned Lin
little Paint Pot Liam okay put my Mac as
a eyeshadow base I used it so much like
last year and then this year I actually
just ran it over it dried up but I was
at the very bottom of it and I just
stopped using it I really really
gosh--oh up in actually I don't go show
up and that much so and then pick up
another one but the same time I got my
old darling highlighter
Crestor Mac had a lien law pport waiting
for me so it's back in my life fun fact
I actually have lien law tattooed on my
wrist because no one can understand me
when I say lien law layin low
yeah so I love layin low the next
product is sweet potent this is the Kat
Von D locket blotting powder initially I
have used this today with het pan with
officially hit pan I think that this is
one of the best powders out there I use
it every single day to go underneath my
eyes and just to say it the metal of my
face really lightly and it's really good
for added on top of your makeup it's
been on for a while or something I just
really really like it really good
translucent powder when I'm buying
makeup or when I'm talking about makeup
I do try and think is this an easy
product for people to get because if
it's not it's a nightmare
I know but I'm like there's some brands
that I love so much you can only get
them from that one website in the
Midland will wear and the Shepherd's and
fortune and blah blah blah so that one
is really easy to get a hold of the
other pair I really like this year is
the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish that predators really gorgeous to
run out of all that went on to this I
really like this as well I think I kind
of even Stephens in my eyes but at the
moment I really really really love this
I have two eyes shadow little pots here
if you've not seen these before these
are the chrome paints from tar and I
just think you're so gorgeous
I've got Park Avenue princess on my eyes
right now which is just really really
beautiful gold with a little bit of
Midnight Cowboy Leto this is also my
favorites this is the urban decay bed
makeover
it's so gorgeous my favorite glitter use
every day just get that fever over the
way but these chrome paints are so
amazed and pigment is nuts like the
pigment of these is so crazy I just
really loved them I think they're
gorgeous
I love using them on my eyes these are
my two favorite colors this is taupe yo
and this is Park Avenue princess they
are so gorgeous if you are making a
tower order or you're passing in Sephora
really recommend going and checking them
out because they are so gorgeous the
last product from tarts that I have here
is the latch applicator I've not done my
latch tutorial yet a lot of you guys
want me to do one because I wear lashes
really really sexy lashes with no Lehner
all the time my eyelashes stay on all
day I never have any problems I think
it's really don't at this little till
here so it's basically just like
tweezers that are shaped to your eye
that don't have any sharp edges so you
can pinch your lash to your lash line
and honestly without this little tool I
would not be able to do my lashes I need
it I need it always so this little thing
is a lifesaver I was trying to think her
eyes shadow palettes that I've loved
this year and I say they've been so many
amazing eye shadow palettes that I've
tried out that it was like it was like
too much it was overwhelming I think
I'll do a whole other video on my top 5
eyeshadow palettes or something because
there's just too many but the one I want
to talk about today is the morphe 3502
I'm not actually the Miss Victoria on
this before but this palette so
beautiful I've got it on today it's the
easiest thing to work with it's super
affordable it's just great and I also
really like the new packaging for morphe
and the new logo I think it's way more
classy you feel like it's a little bit
more like a luxurious product as well I
haven't going traveling on Thursday
means I go to New York and in Toronto
and I can guarantee that I'll be taking
this with me to do my eye looks right I
love a warm brown eyeshadow everyone
know is that ever gets mad at me but
they're the best okay and this is what
I've gone today and I think it's
beautiful
is really really gorgeous the next
product I don't actually have because of
Renault but they are the lashes that I
have one right now I've also got another
pair on my desk right here
they're everywhere in my house so
everywhere these are with the Mykonos
lashes by Lily lashes they are the best
eyelashes I've ever wore in my entire
life I think they're so fluffy and dance
and dark I've started cutting less of
the length away so they really go the
whole length of my eye and I just think
that there are the most beautiful lashes
in the world I think they're stunning
like if I was to make an eyelash it
would be so similar to this I just think
they're so beautiful
and Lourdes you guys ask me all the time
what eyelashes do you have on then comes
a 10 I've got these bad boys on we're
nearly there I have three lipsticks to
show you at the very end but the first
product I'm going to talk about is the
glossy a boy bro this is in the shade
dark I use this every single day I love
it for a brow gel the other think
there's much to say about this product
apart from it's a really good place it I
love the way that it makes my bracelet
really makes them fluffy I always use
this guy first before I use my brow
pencil which is the precisely micro
pencil by benefit these two together is
how I do my brows every single day it's
so easy I'm Way less committed to my
eyebrows no than I used to be I do them
last open my whole makeup I'll do my
face then my eyes and then my eyebrows
so these just get the job done super
quickly and I think that they're both
really good it's middle up stick time
so again if you guys watch my channel
you'll know that I absolutely love nude
lipsticks favorite thing in the world
weirdo everyday get in trouble for
wearing them every day so I throw in the
odd the odd red lip or purple lip just
for you guys so the three products I
have here I really love and these are
what always at my handbag like I had to
go to my handbag to get these out the
bag to show you guys because I've always
got them with me the first one is a mood
a little swatches for these the first
one year is Yash by Mac and it is just a
really gorgeous nude it's perfect it's
not to paint I hate a new this really
really
thankee it just doesn't suit me at all
but I think that it's really really
gorgeous the next one is by bite Beauty
and this is the multi stick and the
sheath blondie
this is rano like when me and Jack are
in New York I need to go to Sephora and
I need to get three of these because
they are this is my favorite knit life I
think of all time and that's that just
there you can see that that's this yeah
SH and this is blondie
this is just a little bit more Brown
favorite nude color ever it's beautiful
I think a little tiny bit later and it
would be like my favorite of all time
ever and then the last lip product I
have for you guys is by dose of colors
and this is the lip gloss and undressed
and it is just stunning
these are all exposures so this is the
lip gloss and Andres it's just flat and
beautiful I don't really loss that much
but when I do it's always less color
it's really pigmented it stays on the
lips I'm really nice we it's not too
sticky it's not too gloopy
it's just flippin perfect it's gorgeous
okay you guys everybody's to make it
today and well done I hope you like my
favorites visio this year it was a
little bit different there was a lot
more kind of skin care that this year
and I'm sure that I've forgotten a bunch
of stuff but at the moment these are
products are always in my makeup bag
they're always in there I use them every
day I think they've made a difference in
my skin the way were makeup goes on the
way my makeup lasts they are tried and
tested totally and yeah I really really
love them as always I will like
everything that I've just talked about
down below so you can have a little read
