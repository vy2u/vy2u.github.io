pounds down to 13 29 I feel like I'm on
QVC or something you want this you get
this for half price and it's also
actually a really cute little say so you
could have got this for someone for
Christmas which is great sweetie
you guys might not remember every this
is a long time ago
when I was mayor far as one of the
felines make up this is this Viva kill
spectrum palette and I used to use these
palettes all the time yeah 15 eyeshadows
in there and it's meant to be
2850 and it's down to 20 to 80 so these
are great really really good for your
cat and also if you're just want an
experiment I really like these when I
was can I practice and that's how my
Instagram started me to practice and my
makeups I used to use these palettes all
the time the next thing I've got as a
really nice gift I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to give this one over
looks I absolutely love these so this is
the less works deep sleep Haven the
candle and it is really sweet
it's an abuti that all white frosted
glass with a kind of shinny this works
rating on it see what you're doing
basically late that's in your bedroom
before you go to sleep and it helps
promote a really really deep sleep I
have actually been using the pillow
sprit version of this for the last two
nights and at Aulani works i've been
having great sleeps
it smells gorgeous it's a mix of
chamomile and lavender with a 40-hour
burn time I don't know what I'm gonna
end up doing with that but I probably
want to keep it for me and that is meant
to be 21:25 and it is down to
1488 these are the Alpha H liquid gold
looks resurfacing body cloths these are
really really good if you wear fake tan
and you need to get off they have the
same glycolic acid I want to think like
well guys if I get that wrong all the
time no I was bloody right it's got the
same glycolic acid and beautifying
botanicals there's a textured side which
is folks fully and and in a smooth sage
which restores hydration that's upon us
and luminosity I do my feet time I've
not done it for a little while but
basically if you wear fake tan really
really good forget and they're gonna
excess off if you don't it's just really
really good free exfoliating
I use glycolic acids and stuff like that
on my face instead of exfoliating quite
a lot yeah I'm very excited with these
you get 25 cloths these are meant to be
27 pounds and they're going to do it 13
points 59
so the next thing I've got here is a big
ol pouch and this is from storybook
cosmetics and this is a rush sets it's
actually a beautiful I'm gonna give
these as a gift to someone already know
who I'm gonna give them to but I hope
Gorge is that it's a proper metal handle
and really really really nice soft
brushes if you know anyone that's a
crazy Disney or finest tea fanatic or
just really likes cute stuff these are
great actually can't believe the quality
of them because I saw them all Overton's
to go and stuff like that but when I
actually go I was like man these are
heavy they're lovely you get four
brushes with metal alloy handles I'm not
going to take them all because I'm
governing I thought they were gonna be
like cheesy plastic but they are
ditching off and then you get your cute
little pouch for them as well very sweet
they wear 45 pounds and it's 36 paints
next product I've got here is the nude
y'all know that I love nude the nude lip
bio lipid concentrate now I have opened
and I've tried that's because I I know
other absent of these products it's just
the coolest concept ever I wasn't sure
what it did until I tried it on and oh
my god
it's a lip plumper so you use it day and
night I use the last night then use it
this morning Africa but as soon as you
put it on you feel it working and your
lips literally go sumptuous luscious and
large it's amazing sign so this is down
from 38 pounds to 30 points 14 very fun
next product about here is the brilliant
skin by sand and sky this mask has been
going super viral and I did actually try
and my vlog last week really deep clean
and really detoxifying and it comes like
this and as a little brush for you to
apply it that is done it from 39:52 3160
a very good gift or cheat for yourself
if you follow a lot of people and
Instagram this stuff could you will
definitely have seen it do I think it's
great yeah
really really nice mask next what I've
got here as the Mario Badescu drying
lotion if you've watched my channel for
a long time you'll know that I really
like these kind of treatments for
blemishes and sports and things like
that but I think this is what I actually
started off using and it's great to try
it if you've not tried anything like
this before it really really nice and
it's also down from sexy nose to 12
pounds 80 the next bracket boat here is
from lovely day this is called mellow
mallow and this is a marshmallow and
sweet almond creamy cleansing gel I've
only tried a couple other products from
the strange but it's really really nice
it's all vegan and cruelty free and it's
really like natural ingredients it's
just a really nice gentle cleansing gel
it's for sensitive to normal skin types
and it's just really sweet as in so
really nice package and stuff so it
should be 17 pounds and it's down to it
11 pounds maintain I'm excited to try
that it's like it's one of those brands
that everything is really really natural
so it's kind of not stay into doing I'm
like that it just it basically gets the
work done I know a lot of skincare
brands that I like that actually they
don't believe in or really perfume
skincare products because they are not
actually they should work like they
should do something but I do think it is
all actually but that's next product
I've got I actually did try yesterday
Nate this is the Antipodes avicad or
peer nourishing night cream it's quite
bad you get 60 mils of it the first
thing that you see on the top is that it
is an award winner again this is a
really really nice natural skincare
scientifically shown to stimulate type
one collagen production and human
fibroblasts sales by up to 92% again
it's one of those names natural skincare
brands that doesn't really smell too
strong but gets the job done really nice

dry skin or if you have dry skin
yourself then this is
Asli it felt great on my skin last night

next nail court here is another lip
