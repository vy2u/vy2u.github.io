i am bringing you my kind of version of
a christmas-gram
lick Rimmel London got in touch with me
again and he wants to work together
again which is great so I have brought
you this look using mostly Rimmel London
products which means as a affordable
makeup to victory which is a good thing
considering Rimmel London are holding a
competition all you need to do to enter
is pushed your Christmas glam looks with
the hashtag get ready with limo
make sure that you act Rimmel London UK
and you could be under the chance of
winning awesome Rimmel goodies and E
Instax camera which is those cute
cameras that you snap and then it's a
guy shake it you shake the pool what's
it called names in camera okay feel like
I'm cleared for you today and I came out
more subtle grungy eye with more natural
brows because I want my focus to be on
these guys my glossing it nude left
they've brought a recollection of
lipsticks for Kate you know Kate Moss so
they've brought the most gorgeous shades
of lipstick for her and there's cute
cute cute roars of packaging I don't
want to create a look can I be styrene
that's a beautiful nude lipstick that
has been brought it I feel like just for
me if you'd like to see how I create
that slick stay tuned okay so we're
doing it in a little bit of a definite
order today first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna prep my eye with my Mac Paint
Pot and Liang law and I'm just using my
finger to do this just again these even
beats under that eye as well and that's
just fine so any kind of beans
discoloration and it's going to make our
eye shadow show up a lot stronger and
last a lot longer as well next thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go and lift the
magnifies Rimmel pallet and this one
it's called London nudes calling and
it's just like a really nice pilots got
a couple of Martin it's in their first
dating I
transition shoot and then the rest of
them are actually came out a little bit
surety but I'm going to show you how to
make this work to get here and these
kind of grungy glam smokey eye so I'm
gonna go in where they're shade to your
first with a fluffy brush and I'm just
going to blend that all over the primer
and that's just gonna say everything
like you shell and make a lot easier to
blade now once that is on we're going to
go in with this shade here which is like
I'm Matt the lilac a transition shade
and then I'm just gonna linger and in
the crease for drugstore Brian Deese it
build up really really well actually it
takes a little bit longer to create the
look that your one end a but for the
price point it's worth it once that's on
I'm gonna swap over and use a smaller
brush like this we bought two to four
and we're going with this sheet here
which does have a little bit of shimmer
through it but once it's on the eye it
doesn't translate too much so I'm going
to use the two to four brush just to
darken that crease up
don't worry too much about any meds
because it's not in our foundation yet
once it starts to get built up nicely on
the top I'm going to actually smoke this
underneath just using the two to four
and darkest shades again and then once
I've kind of got most of the darker
purple one I just use my fluffy brush to
help blend that again no but we're going
to go in with a little bit and the
shimmer from the palette I'm going to
use this nice light shade on my brave
one to highlight and then I'm actually
gonna trace this sheath on the lid which
is like a maze can you could really look
that just act like a really nice bright
born highlight I'm going to use that
same shade on the inner corner and then
I'm just going to use a flat Urban Decay
brush to place that can a gray lilac eat
all shades on to the lid and I'm
actually I'm going to mix the sheet with
the shade here just to meet her a little
bit later for a pop or not
now I'm going to use my scandalize
rewarded mascara by Rimmel also and this
mascara is just great for super thick
dark washes because we've not used any
later today and we're just using the
shimmer the black lash is really really
stunned over against the eyeshadow so
you don't even need policies no matte
finish we're gonna do skin the primer
I'm going to use as the wild top secrets
primer I actually wanted to use my
primer from animal but ojala
I can't find it anywhere I think I
might've accidentally gave it to my mom
but I'm the reason I'm using the way I
feel when it is because I think that
they are really great tips for each
other so the section 21 you'll know what
I'm talking about I'll link it down
below anyway it's white and it's blue
and I'll link this down below as well
they are so similar in texture and
feelings but obviously a really really
different place points so I'm just using
this primer all over I'm just talking my
hair pay my ears on what's quite ugly
I'm sorry foundation I'm going to use as
my match perfection foundation by robot
hey you guys know I love this foundation
I'm using the sheet 200 soft beige and
I'm going to apply it straight from my
Beauty Blender I just love it it's a
great color for me it's a really
beautiful texture it's amusing because
it's obviously sweet yellow too and it
covers all my redness even my lips yeah
I've been using this foundation for
every well know so I really think it's a
great budget foundation and you can see
as soon as the foundations put on the
eyes pop so much more you can really see
the purple tones you can see how dark
they are I think without my skin being
nice and covered they kind of got lost
in my face a bit but now you can see
them I'm going quite cool time to die
when you use concealers I'm not going
too high I'm just gonna blend that into
my hearing lane a little bit know that
my foundations aren't and winnable in it
with the matching concealer this is
match perfection concealer in four feet
soft beige and it shows one of the tubes
the east
and concealer product just come straight
up so I'm just going under my eyes right
tip of my nose doesn't stand it over my
nose my little chin as well and then I'm
just gonna blame them first with my
Beauty Blender
now let's concealer and it goes with a
foundation so it sets on it really
beautifully fab coverage obviously
that's what I'm using it for just a
little bit out of coverage and my kinda
center areas and under my eyes once the
concealer under my eyes is mostly
blended I'm actually gonna go in - I
kind of fluffy brush and I'm just going
to use this to blend the concealer enter
that eye makeup to get a really nice
smooth blend and then what this does is
it just take these up underneath I had a
nice kind of brightness but it also
makes the smokey eye sad shape as well
just gonna sit under my eyes with my Kat
Von D powder and my Beauty Blender and
let's just stop anything from moving
through the V it takes away any kind of
excess product as well and it can excess
oils and that is actually all I do I
know what other people say it like their
entire food but me personally my skin is
just not upset at all when I just obtain
you a little bit coverage with my
concealer I just added a little bit of
coverage just to say to my nose
that is for your at night and is the
most kind of read any I'm going to do is
I'm going to bronze my face up I'm gonna
use the NARS Laguna bronzer and my
morphe in full to crush just the usual
and then the usual adjust on the sides
of my nose up to the brow underneath the
nose and that the sculpt it was just a
lot of that not too much now I'm gonna
need to steam brush and just dust we my
under eyes and then what's left is just
super buff day smokey eyes which is must
Eve okay far let's look I'm gonna keep
her really drawn is here so I'm not
gonna use any blush art I am her my
reckoning is my highlight this is my
bear cut will pull highlight and I'm
just using my it's a Weber fan brush and
the night school cannot up the say to my
brow as well I've not done my iPhoto
after at all and then just a little bit
my nose I'm making small now I am
sufficiently Christmas highlighted I
started gonna play naren with more
natural bruise which is pretty great see
I'm going to use my bread and chocolate
and just mimic little bro here's
just like that and you can see the
difference already it's not much but
it's enough because going to bring them
out go to the front and then little bro
here is again from the front
now just to get the bros that a little
bit more natural-looking I'm gonna use
my sort trick so I'm going to spray a
little bit of my setting spray into the
sort then I'm gonna use my steely from
the end of my brave words to run it back
and forward until I get a little bit can
I throw off there so once you've got a
kind of for me it's a scatter wand or
spilly you just run it through your
brows and that's the trick set your
brows it but it also meets um look
thicker I think like the soup sticks to
the hair is which makes the hairs looks
like how it makes them exactly where you
want them to even if you've got stubborn
bro here's like me it means you can get
them sitting nice and straight up at the
front
which makes them look super kind of fill
and natural I just think it looks like
supermodel browse for my lights I'm
going to be using food normal products
that I really really like and the Kate
fact means anniversary lipstick and this
is in the shade borehole note which is
stunning burn orangie brownie note I
love it I'm really excited to bring us
today and I'm gonna use a slightly
darker lip liner and then on top I'm
gonna pop on all my gloss gloss which is
super super super super hydrating and
it's got a really great machine offer as
well so that's what we're gonna do today
the lip line I'm going to use is liar
from Urban Decay it's just my kind of
favorite darker liner brush that I like
and these pros I just thought something
quite stand out for the lips would be
pretty
so once the let's our light I'm gonna go
straight in with the lipstick which is a
little bit later than the lip liner so
it's going to give me any skin and
nineties on rillette
now you guys is the finished look I hope
you like that and I love that using
these budget Brown products and get an
effective look so all they remember to
upload Europe très masculin loops onto
instagram and hashtag it get ready with
Rimmel make sure that you act the rebel
London UK and then you could be in with
a chance of winning
loads of remedies and and Instax camera
I hope you guys like this look and I
will see you next time with another
