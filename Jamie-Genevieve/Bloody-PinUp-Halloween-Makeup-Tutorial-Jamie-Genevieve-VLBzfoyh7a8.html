week I have brought you a little
Halloween tutorial really really simple
actually and it's actually not even a
Halloween tutorial if you don't do the
tears if you don't do the tears it's
just a nice makeup to be fair really
really simple to do you don't need much
product at all apart from what's already
in your makeup bag the only thing that
you may need if you want to buy it as
blood thick Bloods and you can do a lot
of DIY stuff with the Bloods all I would
say is make sure that what you're
putting new your eyes is allowed to go
near your eyes okay I don't want any
blind people and when everyone going
blind over let's look so what I've done
is I've just paired up with a really
simple we've acted it all I have not
recorded her to do this because I'm
awfully here and it took me about 20
minutes to get it and neat enough to
record so if you like to see how I
created this lick station okay first day
as soft ocher all over the lid as always
so soft ochre is just a paint pot by Mac
it just helps a shadow stay in place all
day all night and it gives you a really
nice color appeal as well so I'm just
going all over the lids just a light
layer on underneath as well if you watch
my videos already you will know that I
use this every day every single day it's
once you've got a nice layer of that and
the brush I'm using is just a wee jewel
fiber one unbranded by it does a job now
I'm just going on with a Smith to see to
brush and I'm going to use the anastasia
beverly hills palette the shadow
Cuchillo world traveler and we're just
going to go in with the shade soft peach
which is the latest in the palette and
I'm just going to use that all over the
crease first and foremost really good
pigment with these eyeshadows so you
don't need too much but I'm just
blending that up to the concealer
underneath the brow and only then
they're loyal wet free of product now
I'm going to go in with the shade Morel
core which is it can a light brown shade
it's really warm and I'm just going to
use that on the crease this area is
quite like a 50s look so I'm trying to
keep as true to that as possible
maybe just a little bit more dramatic as
it's Halloween and I'm just swapping
over with our morphe m3 sleazy little
brush just to offer a little bit and hat
that had product owner would just come
back in with molecule fiber that are
used with mistletoe coat just to lean
back throw in a little thick so I went a
little bit harm their weight a little
bit crazy I'm just gonna go in with a
really light shade of eyeshadow really
shiny one asper placing on the Laura
lights to give that a little bit pull
and I'm gonna go in the inner corner a
little bit as well I'm gonna go in with
the shade fudge and the Anastasio Pilate
and I'm just gonna place that under my
lower lash line and then I'm just gonna
plain that I with the warm brown shade
we've used on the lid already with a
little pencil brush now I'm going to use
nabla magic pencil which is just a
really light pencil to get that pop and
your lower waterline and I'm just going
to use that right along far let's look
the liner is probably the most important
part and I'm going to use the gosh laner
filter this is just called intense
eyeliner pain and I'm just gonna get
these flecks nice and romantic
now I'm going to go back in with my
pencil brush and I'm going to use a dark
brown shade this is fudge from the
palette and we're just going to
intensify the crease then I'm just going
to go in with Mac upward lash and black
and give my lashes a generous coat
underneath as well obviously to finish
this look off I'm just going to add a
pair of m1 all-fours by ill to Adolfo's
lashes while that lashes drying I'm
going to show you one of the funniest
textures I have ever seen I put on my
Instagram just like I wrote a while ago
it's basically sandbar and his diet from
Lion King Simba everything the light
touches is for you highlight but Dad
what was was shadowy places over there
somewhere that is really going to her I
was gonna pop this flash on these lashes
are honestly the best and I like that
for the skin on this look it's pretty
similar to my everyday foundation but
we're just gonna do more dramatic
highlight contour so starting off with a
little bit of fixed price or half the
bottle and then on top of that and when
it was straight and where that Laura
Mercier foundation primer which I'm a
sign-off
I find that when I use there's my friend
Ian Joseph tend to last a little bit
longer
I've already done my eyebrows obviously
and I've done a wee bit more drastic
than usual and quite strong but he'll be
once that is kind of some kind I'm going
to go in and worth my usual
Illamasqua foundation in 8.5 I'm gonna
get a decent amount on the back of my
hand until apply that much news then and
none she blended beast brush which is
the r01 brush and I'm just gonna pop
that all over at methi's quite a decent
coverage so just enrich looks with this
brush and can't even out the under eye
area just named go NATO over the lips
for a head
I've already kinda half done my hair
because I wasn't ready to record it
because I've had
yeah I'm really really about that here
so just kind of done a quick victory at
all those 15 on that just making sure
that you've got a nice blended bass as
the brush let's see what fine Everett
that's Halloween liquors electorally
doesn't get Halloweeny until you put the
blood on so you can kind of just use
this as an a specialties tutorial if you
don't want to do Halloween obviously if
you watch other deals already you'll
know that I use this foundation every
day against the base coverage it lasts a
long guest and it's just majestic and
every single way now what I'm going to
do this is another reason I love this
foundation is that they have a weight
version so what's left over the back of
my hand
I'm gonna mix that with fertile daughter
weight and then I'm gonna go in with the
Sigma soft blend concealer brush which
is just a really nice brush that's good
for using with liquids and I'm just
gonna mix it on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna guess where I'm gonna
highlight and then cuz it's just a
foundation the texture it blends
beautifully and she place that just
blend blend blend if you're into it
really can I have your makeup like me on
a day-to-day basis you could totally do
this as a highlight anyway this is quite
strong especially since it's not to put
any of the shimmer on you it does with
you
does look really nice sufficiently high
wages for my contour I'm going to go in
it with these we bought lots highlight
brush which I like using a contour and
I'm just gonna go in with my usual
market dark tan bronzer and we're going
to just kind of carve out the cheekbones
I'm gonna go quite heavy with us I find
that powders tend to blame these are on
top of this foundation I really like
just blending straight onto the
foundation without it being purged up
don't already but if you use something
like Double Wear maybe a little light
powder and before you do something like
this otherwise make up at Kiki we're
going to draw a little back and forehead
just to sharpen up the contour and when
you're going with the second mark
concealer brush again and I'm just gonna
hook underneath that coins on either
side now y'all know how much I love
highly so well this is like highly or
normally paint paint so you're going to
put a lot of the odd
I'm just gonna use the media loot
manizer by the balm Beck fan said he
called innate city Yale awaits or if
you're super panky it may look a bit
funny but most it's going to unsub try
go on illusion tonight so we're just
gonna apply that's unusual spot so cheek
bones right under the eye and I'm gonna
Halloween makeup tutorial right now but
I left elf this morning and I was trying
at my eyes open at all singing like the
sign a song and then I was like she was
emotional and everyone's happy I was
gonna get her place it's because sadness
let's play again and yeah it was like a
new ball but I don't think I'm what
excited but Christmas and Halloween this
year hey bats
alright I feel bad I was taking that
highlighter right onto the forehead cuz
I do want to look like a little doll I'm
gonna go under the contour they don't
tell me I'll explain
I will die highlight okay and that is
how I am going to leave the skin for
this look at the moment and let's do
let's okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna rub the can of excess of keeping
the highlight and the foundation their
own types and for this because it's a
Halloween look I would definitely
recommend using a liquid lipstick for
this look so I am gonna here is that one
I've had for a while from Elaine claim
because I have no other ones that are
any connote similar in color and it's
like a super dark red it's called
Wicked's
I'm just gonna put a light layer on all
over not too worried about the like
layin in anything
oh well and now once I've done that I
want this to be pretty neat so I'm gonna
go in with a light brush this is just to
be in yx1
and I'm gonna I've got it Florence on
the back of my hand and we're going with
that and then I'm gonna use a lip brush
to get the nice neat sight
just to get a nice and dark once you've
applied that you just keep on kind of
going over and over with layers of the
fly dope once you've got your desired
sheet once you have your lip on and
you're happy with it and I do really
recommend using a lip brush with liquid
lipsticks instead of using that okay
because you can never get I'm just super
sharp like unless you're like a wizard
yeah so that's looking at say oh if I
were totally just wear those I probably
will today after I take the rest of it
off but no for the Halloweeny part so
what you can do is you can map out here
at the tears are gonna cool I like doing
that just to make sure that they're
gonna be so they're not all like the
same laying I've got a live a lip pencil
this is just a make up forever
waterproof one and I'm literally just
gonna map out where they're gonna go so
I think I'm gonna have maybe two and one
Satan three on that other so I'm a
weirdo because I've got my nose piercing
on this side I don't want to say to you
if you're heavy with latent detail so
I'm gonna do two on this not three on
this site and I think have one starting
from the outer corner well this pencils
not drawing I'm gonna have one you can
not even barely see that I can kinda see
it and we're going from there one from
the inside and we'll do one from the
middle as well okay that'll do for that
and we're gonna do two on this age I
think what I'll do is I'll have one
coming from inside and then we'll do one
of them I don't want to have one and
it's a theory so you'll have this one
about longer yeah we're just gonna have
I'm Caitlin doing what we're gonna start
with that and we can change it if we
need and know what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go back and that's a liquid
lipstick infuse and I'm going to use
that and we're paint on the tears first
because this way the ink on move
underneath I know I'm going to bring it
there like looks like a little bit
underneath my eyes will like my eyes are
kind of filled up and they're just kind
of pulling over cuz I'm just so upset
okay I'm nineteen fifties and I'm sad
I'm gonna go right under the eye with
like we lipstick there know what you can
do as you can kind of round off some end
and that gonna make something look more
like to your drops I feel like I want to
do a little one of the ends here just
even up yeah put it a little one here
now what we're going to do is we're
going to go end with the blood
so what I'm going to use is emulated
every Asian blood you can get this
online and I will put the name of it
down below and let just tap it into
Google and you'll find it before though
you don't have to use this I know that
you can use corn syrup and red food dye
you can use scab blood you can use
actual run earbuds but the run your pod
for this look is really amazing because
it will just run down your face so the
reason I like this is because it's
really tacky it comes in a chip I'm just
going to squeeze out about and I'm just
gonna use the same approach that I've
used or my work to end my eyes and I'm
just going to pick up some of the Bloods
and I'm just gonna place it and lanes
down you're the tears and I'm gonna go
right underneath the lash line as well
because that stuff's kind of shiny it
goes out a really good effect something
that I did in the previous flu it kind
of cuts at this look last year sometime
AI
arched the brows up here which made me
look sad all time good thing about that
was as it's super sucky
and it kind of dries which means it
would run down your feet it does feel
sticky or kua it's Halloween you don't
really mean to you it's almost like I
kind of sad pinup ghetto and that but
it's a look that I really liked from
last year it's really really simple I
don't quite a few clients as well but
you can actually appear this with like a
nice tray and you're done so that's the
finished look
I really really hoped you liked it it's
really really simple Halloween night
yeah and it's quite good because it
doesn't take too much skeletony that
should just pack some tears on and if
then but man see that's fine because I
am a mighty crier for sure when I try on
my everywhere so yeah totally
I went away and I added a little tiny
little bit on I expanded some of the
tears and I did a little beauty mark
just to make it that a little bit more
fifties babe
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
Halloween tutorial and who knows maybe
I'll have another one before Halloween
comes whoa thank you so much for
watching again guys and I will see you
next week with another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
