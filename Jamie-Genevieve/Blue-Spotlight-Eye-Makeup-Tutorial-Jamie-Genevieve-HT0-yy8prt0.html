today we're going to go over this spot
Lee I got going on here so this was
actually a request from my nail tech who
gave me these beautiful talons today hey
I love ru I've had two I've had to call
them something it would be Princess Elsa
frozen mermaids yep that's what I call
them so they're obviously blue and I've
got blue here and I decided to use blue
of my eyes as well so feel free well I'm
it like going through the products I
just use different products if you don't
wanna use blue and you don't want to use
believe you'd do neutral which is still
readable you can do red paint purple
thank of the rainbow you could do any
color from the rainbow totally up to you
and I to us blue obviously because I am
feeling that vibe as I'm not sighs I'm
not a blue as in my boots but I'm just
taking the color right now it away so
yeah I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and if you have any ideas on what you'd
like to see you next week please help me
up enjoying I'll see you next week guys
bye okay so starting off with Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot usual and I'm just gonna
do it elite dust in about all over my
lids underneath as well
going in with my sugar pills sparkly
palette and the color is candy crush the
only blue
I'm good you're late dusting of fat all
over creaks blending up towards the
eyebrow candy crush is a beautiful light
blue and I'm obviously feeling the Blues
these days not seriously I'm quite happy
but the color is good so bringing out
upwards towards my prey and Gwen right
under the eye as well
and I'm just using my zoeva luxe a soft
definer brush super fluffy then I'm
going in with my zoeva luxe pencil brush
to theory and my Ella masca Wolfe
eyeshadow chocolatey Brown and I'm just
gonna go straight and it's my inner
corner and popcorn the color they're
blending it out towards the same tire
and underneath and then the same on the
air outside
I'm gonna draw a V shape so going up and
my feet and along the lash line
underneath as well
just leave in the center Oh making sure
that it can I say I mean near the pupil
neg why packing with a fluffy brush
we're gonna buff that out because the
sugar pal shimmery shadow as Mason salt
is really super easy to play and soak
one in there as well
you going to end with a little bit more
pros are just using that to make a bit
darker then we're going to go in with
Ella mask eye shadow in sex which is the
best way I shadow on the market I would
save and we're going to pack that on
yeah in the middle and that really makes
it pop and then back in with a candy
crush blue color alright and then I'm
going to use the Urban Decay cosmic moon
dust I shadow just like this and using
it with a slightly damp brush we're
gonna pack on that color so it's really
sparkly
and underneath just over the plate cool
then I'm going to use a steel alright
stay in place WRI pencil and this color
is teal so these pencils are gorgeous
they come in all different colors so you
don't need to get there but great ones
but obviously I did Google and the water
line and the dark part and then known
spotlight then in the spotlight we're
gonna go in with next pencil and milk
the jumbo pencil which is just my go-to
backhand with a pencil brush and roof
eyes shadow just to make it a little bit
darker
and just blending that out with my soft
definer cool added a generous coats of
mascara I'm using
Illamasqua Atmos quarter and I'm going
to add on a pair of LM a scout flashes
and 17 which are really cute iron like
EOC they obviously have our drama as
well sorry guys I have a cold again
story with my leg make sure that glue it
thanks I'm tacky
work with me here if you're struggling
getting your eyelash and gets better and
hold underneath your eye use tweezers to
please flash all in your lash light
there's some things the hardest in the
world and that says done I hope you guys
liked it
