week I thought I would do a drugstore
slash know what shitty cosmetics makeup
I don't want cheap as to his body who
wants Cheadle and this a is it going to
be like from though obviously I went to
boot so if you're in the UK you're
watching this I got everything from
boots today and I went and I went in and
I wanted to spend twenty five pound and
then I spent Erica - but I will show you
the end why that was I know a lot of you
have noticed that most of the makeup I
use in my tutorials and higher than once
then save the only reason that I really
got all that stuff is because it's my
job it's my job to have all this makeup
and from a care and to try and show you
guys what it's like so I thought I would
go other into the skill I do a drugstore
shop and do makeup so I'm really
surprised with the results really
surprised if you would like to see how I
made the split agent okay let's start
with wake me up concealer anti-fatigue
if they can read it glow and the car I
got with ivy which I'm pretty sure is
the lighting gear right for that
and I'm just going to use a sponge this
is a nine shape for in one sponge I'm
going to push that in this is the first
time I've ever used these things so
we'll see what happens
what's really rude but anymore
Wow I certainly does wake up I love that
so edge really really peel I do feel
quit peel but no it's time for a
foundation so I just packed up the week
makeup finish in his well because I was
actually shopping with my little cousin
and she would say almost something today
it's me
so we'll let's do this the color I got
is probably wrong soft beige I'm going
to apply this with a 90 angle pure brush
brush and first an ultimate Beauty
Blender the top let's see what this
looks like
well I color thank goodness
smells nice Oh so that's trailer flea
that's the me say pious ornate it really
many things can be it's clear late but
the coverage is good and it covers
everything you wanted to I'm really
happy I picked up the red color just see
if it spelled well I guess
additionally here's a tiny bit of
concealer over my eyes because my budget
did not allow me face primer
yeah yep you've been 5050 bahah oh I'm
just putting one more on because I love
it I can't wait to go forward with that
and see if it's nice there as well
that's it the freshest I've looked in a
long time I am exhausted today I am so
tired okay my brother Lester pros so
picks up the normal again I agreed I got
so much random stuff and scores it was
to buy one gate taking two half trades
so always so much tracks in a budget so
I got four things from Revell and the
third is this eyebrow pencil and I got
dark plain pink here but I don't know
what to do with it
so yeah let's have a go at that like
okay do you know what this is this is so
much easier as well it's not the easiest
going from a pair a pair of type in
Seoul but thinking just like short
strokes and I'm just going to use with a
little bit of foundation with an angled
brush just to clean up brai
that's totally acceptable there's makeup
leave it inside
I made a mistake say we've got sealer
hey so I got a little eye shadow
that's create the pad which is are just
going on D cuz I can just I can just put
it up holiday yeah we're going to put
this on our eyes ro screen you sense a
highlight
double double whammy two birds one stone
so this is really quite fresh look today
if you hadn't K Creek yo
and this is just $2.99 from natural
collection from boots and the shadows
called will just delete you mascara
obviously what I was buying this stuff
I'll actually just got the stuff that I
would really need to do a look that I
could leave the house with so this is a
natural collections again everything
that these sales 189 and this is the
lash belt mascara creates thicker lashes
for extra volume so let's try this okay
it's not bad
okay a little mother but it was $1.99
and the scatter i usually is as 2012 so
if she divided this Moscato you lose by
10 this is quite good
sakuya good thing next as cheap cool I
do not want that okay I bought Persia
and this is a little blush blusher
called copper Brown and I just thought
that it was the rating a color that I
can kind of chosen on my cheeks a little
bit but I'd color the same time so
highlight and Bush know contour and wash
it's easy to give you this little freaky
brush I'm not going to use this you feel
free I can't do it
so I'm going to go in with Matt normal
angle brush from zoeva and this is a
cute color oh that smells good yeah
I actually really like that I think
that's probably suitable for like
everyday just chess linen more clunker
this is actually really good stages for
cleaning up as well let's go back and
with that little cute I shower door and
use as a highlight
great you can't really argue that is
also what Natan a that's really quite
good we're going to offer oh so shiny
last but not least I got a little updo
so first thing I got was always like a
nude lipstick and this is the keep more
strange and Rimmel so this is the fourth
piece of my Rimmel collection of court
now and I've actually used these before
and I think I love them but I've never I
never ever going to leave boots or super
jogging anything to get things like this
so I'm glad that this is color 42 and
the pants like all is just natural
collections when they annoying again
considering the painter I usually buy is
like eating poems as plate please isn't
it so likely I've got a super dark like
really really dark because I think
Leonor and SLE affair I'll probably just
use it all over as a pencil so let Elena
lips first
that is one of the best pencils I've
ever use it's so firm or update time
that would be handy
so this pencil is called it special and
I think I love it
it's super dark but it's hard as well
like I just use law to that and it's
still really far it's there like at
point love lol continue use that I'll
put that maquette as well because
basically see here log at last and then
this it is 42 in the keep Martin it
I love it I love it
that's definitely one of the nicer nudes
I've tried so that's the finished look
so I think let me go this way my choice
ol Kim to 3272 so it's a little bit or
what I wanted to spend 25 and if I hide
the board with the lip liner and I had
to bothered with a concealer something
like that I would have made that but I
would have rather I've got this done so
Foundation which is the rebel selfish
and waking up foundations eating to name
there then I saved Iona got the lipstick
for 274 because it was half crazed and
then I bought the concealer which was
the rebel London we cannot concealer and
that was number ivory the name was
overdue and that was the palest one and
I used that highlight and chisel and
pick will look it may be a bit too late
and and then I got the grey Pinto no I
much prefer anasazi that blow I love it
and I think you get much more precise
with it this is good for daytime but see
close-up it's not as neat as I like them
and it's really difficult to get out
with a pencil
unless you've got like a lot of time on
your hands I shouldn't have a lot to in
my hands and we've got bourgeois blush I
know that was eight pounds I didn't need
to buy that but I really really liked
the color so I bought it so see if I
hadn't bought that I would have read the
budget to the butcher or sure call me
Joe
three things from natural collections
which was the mascara which is just
black lash belt don't mother don't buy
it then it's place all lip liner
syntactic and their eyeshadow all and
well all this is fab
I got this as a highlight and that is
the shiniest highly
oh and I'm not going to go into my braid
but I would definitely buff a little bit
that I drew and they're so badly made
the pants just follow so you can go and
put it in your Z palette in the one
route nor the pigment when they name for
it amazing me he said so yeah I've
actually I think my eyes have been
opened to drugstore short thing CMake
and you call it drugstore shopping that
we call it boots or Superdrug are you
can take school days ago as a good girl
so guys thank you so so much for
watching and I will see you next week
