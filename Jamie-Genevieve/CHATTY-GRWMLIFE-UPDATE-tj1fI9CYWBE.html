I'm just cannot working through a new
I did my brother's off camera because I
actually get them like the olden days I
used my Charlotte Tilbury very well but
in an actual River in them which came to
corn which is why I used to use all the
time in and yeah we like that that are
weave it sparingly that dark unusual but
you know changing changing things up for
my skin and women second Matrix CC cream
if you have an Instagram you'll know
this is my new favorite thing as X psst

really really clear that the mantle cuz
I Lindsey reward and it's cool it's a
sport I keep two times on the back of my
hands it's actually not that much my
shade is medium and you get 32 mils of
product and the chips but we're going to
do it and we do my little dog thing with
a little Milnes hundred oh so I asked on
fire I was like guys what would you like
to see from me and you said a lot of
people so just check it they just me
which is fine I love doing them and a
couple people said Phil coverage so that
is actually totally still coverage and
and also because I'm not feeling my best
caught Jack thank you cool that'll be
good screaming filled tons better and
then a lot of you guys were asking the
front of selfies just or tutorials
actually I'm up for that
so I'm going to and we're such that oh
and we do a video and it's all going to
be all word of some favorite things when
you think so really I've adored that all
over so they can spread out and when you
the brush blend and this is actually the
heavenly skin CC skin perfect and number
seven or two at Cosmetics fresh new look
at this is that not amazing so I've been
reading there pretty much every day
since aboard
so the toilet I was nervous to use it
the cause it's a CC cream and obviously
I like a foundation and ally get to be
still coverage behind I bet the kids you
know what I'm like with reading tutors
would usually do it by rare
determinative so cabochon way
have an air cannon ccq Musil privilege
and Lydia's at weapon limit at
photograph beautifully
I saw do it just amazing I don't know
how I've not tried it before I remember
there was a big high provided I will use
a smaller brush to get in between my
little members but I remember there was
a cute a parade it was like what it was
like YouTube saying wasn't it and
everyone wanted it but I was literally
I'm Esther bought so many times always
my suit I'm just here to reinforce the
good reviews and I love it and I'm just
using the excess in the back of my hand
just to push into my nose area
how great is a roll a little bit and all
right it's like for concealer I'm going
to use the Tarte Amazonian clay
waterproof trailer or concealer and it's
gone dude should all these days it's
like a lipstick political it fits or
would have tried of sight under my eyes
mmm and I'm going to do it over rate I
like I like the application cool I'm
actually just going to blend to Emma
this brush as well Wow right I like that
my face is I've been amazed and I'm
going to I the two days after Bachmann
said this is the third day purchase or
create sort of you've had basis with
poorly remember I like your teeth are
movin course would have heart but today
I did add a little bit size so I just
went over to do this I'm going to weigh
in it with my little Neela spender and
supply my land roll up to the concealer
because always been a car by pros I own
anything so I'm just going to apply that
up to the concealer and I'm going around
go underneath my eyes well cool and then
I'm going to one missus Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish
pergurt and I'm going to go underneath
my eyes and over my eyes to say
everything and I've been doing this
instead of bacon and it's been working
really tough so a quick update for you
guys means that you're actually in
process of trying to mitosis so
everything we've it up in the ears
moments but we start packing just in
case so all the way literally
and boxes behind their every to disease
decimate an embryo or just slowly
working through the whole house getting
rid of all the crap we've collected by
accident and just packing everything up
I'm really really really excited but all
my goodness
moving hoes and trying to buy a house
and trying to do all the shipping
paperwork and stuff and probably the
most stressful thing I've ever done
mentally but probably if I am sick
because every day of them what can we
kind of get stuff done it's been really
crazy we're gonna absolutely pusher
Ariel I'm going to contour my face with
my Mac dark can go inside I used to use
as all time and not used everywhere else
so I'm really liking it and this using
my Smith one-one-two brush sees and
we're going to go on top but obviously
I've not powdered this CC creams but all
apparel is going so beautifully on top
of it and that's just really warm that
my skin I don't know how is the rs.50
seen once is like perfect match for me
it's really great I'm so excited about
the feedbacks I go from my chemistry at
makeup on Instagram that was so exciting
and so I'm really buggin to do more than
extreme stuff again because let me
remember when I used to create the whole
time and then I worked in onyx when I
was doing client and then I've gotten
cut out of a rock when I was just doing
glam makeup all times movie eyes all the
time so it's really really fun to do it
something a bit more creative let me
know if you ever wanted to do tutorials
or more creative stuff obviously I know
it's not as popular and people really
care as much about it as we can be but
if usually want to see it nailed it up
for you guys but if I want it rolled
funny ones to film because it's just as
a creative person it's not a tensor
component I discussed it angle to make
up really well there are systems the
systems in wacky stuff so this is
Thunder Dominic's I like to warm my feet
up a whole bunch when it isn't like
doing my launch and stuff interpolation
Gatien is that you can always move
around afterwards yeah I can't like to
go right up to by even L finish with
graduate days and you skip out in the
air and he guys work so enjoyed a lot

oranges I'm going to apply a little bit
of blush I'm going to use my Charlotte
Tilbury powder and sculpt brush and

stopped using it you've been in that
wrote down and I'm going to flip my fan
brush up and just blend that up towards
my temples
after watching
a less Deluxe's video I've thought
highlight many minor ones because this
makes my nails look slimmer and we're
not going with these shades mixed
together again and I'm going to just go
down the bridge of my nose so it's all
you it felt pure extrinsic really always
the need to know keep this ball good
okay thanks tonight but more like a
night it will do so active palates here
I've got the Modern Renaissance palette
and I've got a passel golf palette and
we're actually use a better board I got
governor as PR which is really really
far and I'm really grateful and I use it
yesterday and I use these three colors
it was really really cute I think this
is the kind of palette you reduced for a
pop of color or if you're lovin colors
and that's all you can mess will come
together and do late year underneath and
plate on top Republic scooting so I'm
just going to use a pop color and not
sure what when you buy when you use this
to build up in a neutral base and I'm
going to use one of these colors on
cinnamon hey guys it means
so I've already modified my less
excetera and we avoid a tricky she's
here and when I multiply my lid once
more one more time so tell me guys what
would be about 10 or 11 who you lovin
queer you being who you've seen just
give me a little update below let me
know what war because it's been a while
since I better try it with me then we
went with the to draw Sienna who I'm
just going to build up that crease
Jack's a weird moment he is gaping
ingredients for us to make econ each
night I cooked dinner I know I don't
know what's happening to me I'm domestic
it and we're gonna get sick
it was actually like selling healthy and
yeah I just weenie and really healthy
I'm loving it annexed are not really any
rings and yeah just be kind to eat super
healthy and if you know fewer body so if
you've got if there's any Instagram
accounts that you guys love that are
like inspiring for like body and fitness
and healthy en please let me know below
cousin folder them all and just
everything we cannot pump unless you
deny 54 best remark by the way and
displaying that up for some time and
I've actually really meant the way
things blend when you do
very low with concealer and much that
rate way up these shadows are so
stunning I really do recommend more than
magnetrons palette to anybody who is
looking a couple of words because it's
just beautiful
I want me to do a brown eyes I'm going
to be a real car here which is just a
really nice orange shade and we could
see really much about is really really
nice
I don't know what we're going to do I
know that our to show pain for some
drugstore makeup if it's all good
question for you guys is there anything
from the doctor makeup that you love
today that you think I should get and
try because I do have I feel collections
but I want to work I will Morris I can
keep more tips more tutorials for you
guys and my left is born and when I'm
really sorry it's bothering me swimming
in I can't can't be helped
oh I may as well mention reveals the
reason I've got visas is because
vectored exactly moved on ad but let's
just use two step too far back and in
some light ends and in some fools it
looks like I had a dark tips because the
front teeth would cast a shadow over it
and it just really bothered me
and Max mail is real is lot flavors so
if when I'm talking you'll see that the
stage one is more the nest site and it's
nothing to do with less injections badly
and just as we my friend says it's
always been like that 11 directions
maybe accentuate its weight a slight
better so yeah my keeping Street well I
think make a difference to me and it's
difficult because literally when I made
and I'm Steven upon free server an hour
it's hard it's hard not a Chris I who
can it scrutinize your flaws and
insecurities and that you can warm in
small business I would swap and set the
password golf pala and I'm actually
going to use the she'd gloom this
beautiful greens and would fit up
underneath my eyes that would be nice I
made a quick cool whoopsie okay oh quit
love that I think this is the easiest
way to get a fall for color with a
weekend like two notes without your
comfort zone if you're not mean kind of
quite a lot people are someone to me you
love unnatural you love that neutral I
should see not matter or
I'm going to authenticate a fluffy brush
this is my eyeball totally crease brush
and we're gonna get in that green color
and I'm just going to really buff that
out
mmm
do you love it holy Bobby let's
focus in school thing I'm just going to
leave that an autofocus and you can tell
me why I buy this guy
okay that'll work it adds really great
and really from the dots here at the
moment and whenever when we receive
sizes number which is just account and
we're dark out my lashline yeah I'm
taking it look at me guys I'm like a
flippin rainbow and we blend that again
with my little brush quit love that and
I'm super woman's real cardigans really
warm shade on top yeah so when meantime
with hoes I think it's going to be
reserved forever reform so I'll actually
be able to do it up and we're going to
blow moving in and we're going to blow
up do it up and we're going to do like
progress support all the hoes we're
getting stuff done and it's going to be
is really really fab I'm really full and
expressive and I'm going to pack that
later shadow on all over my lid oh I
thought of a highlight on it okay okay
that's right and I actually doesn't
think about that but I think how we
clearly clues will commence this year
unless like 10 months away but I've been
watching Halen Anderson and her blog
channel is Anders and she blog NPD
I did not know she woke every day that's
amazing but they're all really really
late as well they're really nice to warp
space and artistic so yeah we say and
I'm going to try it and we're try it is
here good planet I just used the shade
roomier on the inner corner as we
highlight
and I like Septimus Catalan just bad boy
I'm going to speculate mascara from pure
again and other views in the last few
minor deals but apparently when I'm
watching youtubers I don't mind if do to
use products because usually I've got
the products that it says because do
recommend them
so forget Felix its products in athlete
I'm just fitting this has got our over
lashes i like this mascara a lot this
doesn't come off and we do a bottom
lashes which is slightly trickier as
mess let's get a little mirror
the last thing I'm going to use are true
pure full eyelashes and they're clearly
see as well they look like mine crashes
this is the sale chances are they look
like my glasses but they're actually
made of silk so they're truly free so if
you guys are one and make fail lashes
but also not mink

used these this fails like three times
already and you still look brand-new
okay I'm uglier one balloon

want to get my little tart applicator

lashes and then I've just got my lashes

Oh in my students realities or I want to
do the Royals I'm going to use Kat Von D

dream I don't want to do it my lip liner
first and if you watch I'm actually
going to do it over draw them and
different weights or a little under here
and then we will all right an aunt
instead of doing my Cupid's bow I'm just
going to cut straight across and then
follow my lip line doing asleep and that
has been overdone I'm recently just like

this little bit back and then where's my
pure spray again and my face is
