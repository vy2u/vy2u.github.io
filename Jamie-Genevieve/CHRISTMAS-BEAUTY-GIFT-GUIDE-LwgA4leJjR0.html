Wow hi guys welcome back to my Channel
today I'm going to show you my kind of
gift guides my beauty gifts gave for
Christmas
sorry this video was really some of you
may have to use this as kind of ideas
for what to spend my Christmas money on
because and I got home from New York
everyone five days ago six days ago and
I've been in my bed since I've not been
very well I'm definitely getting better
now today's the first day that I've put
any makeup on for a long time with
something feeling pretty good and yeah
I've got loads of lovely things in front
of me here that I'm gonna show you guys
I just think these I really can amaze
little ideas for Christmas time some of
the things are on the kinda larger scale
and then some of the things are just
really cute stocking fellows things like
that so I hope you like it this M was a
present from Tarte I went to the Jingle
Ball and Madison Square Garden with her
and they had these hats so I thought I
would wear that during the video to be
facing so I'm just really excited I'm
not going to go through these in any
particular order one thing I'm gonna do
and I'm gonna let everything that I talk
about going below I now have the link to
the product and I'll also have the place
because I can't remember the places for
everything
often top of my head there's a few
things here also this isn't going to be
an in-depth review of these products
this is just the product why I like it
why I think it's cute for Christmas and
that's pretty much it
first thing I'm going to show you is
right here so every I'll show you it's
the Emma Hart it amazing it feeds
Christmas bauble so this is really key
idea because you can actually hang this
on your tree so it's really good winding
it for a stocking fellow and inside you
get the Moringa cleansing balm and you
get a professional jeweler action
cleansing cloth I'm not actually trying
this product yet I'm gonna try it I'm
going to put on my chi and we used on
Christmas Day it lets you open it up now
is actually like a little warm up you've
got the cleansing balm in here and then
you've got the face cloth on the other
half really to shoot the next thing I've
got
and also tree decoration is the by Terry
Baume the rules
as a pair lesson lip balm so it's just a
really nice look back up right it is a
super luxury brand and again it's just
something that's next to hang on the
tree my face it's early as fast it's a
really really cute pill pink lip balm
it's not too much at all at which to
everybody and it's good for all ages as
well the next thing I have here it was
something I got through the meal really
recently is the new 30s pro ball to go
and their little contour palette I see
little because it is a little very shiny
so instead of having the four
highlighters and the two contour shades
you just got slightly smaller pan but
you've got to my lights here and you've
got the contour color and the highlights
are actually really beautiful is my two
favorite toys uprightly in that palette
so yeah really really cute Oh stocking
filler the next product I have our from
Ibrahim little bit of so far but in its
just a really cool brand of this
up-and-coming is we here cure so we here
Pierre is all over the internet right
now you owe your favorite youtubers and
instagramers are using these products
the reason I got these products is
because I've been seeing all my kind of
failure youtubers and Instagram is using
these products so we and a miracle here
at brands hair care brands I have the
hair oil here the texturizing it here
stay and the treatment mask I haven't
tried the treatment mask yet
in sight but inside you get tons of
sashi's so it's eight to try that and I
have tried to hear oil really really
nice nice and lightweight perfect for
here obviously some oils can be a bit
too thick
snails beef Oh and then the text I can
hear spray is really nice as well I just
tried a little bit through my veins and
actually got my hair done and it just it
does just add extract and make sure
you're kind of look a little bit more
undone really really like that I just
think it's cool to try something new
Christmas if you're buying this for
somebody they're gonna be put in place
because I can guarantee that they'll
know what it is the next thing I have is
by we WTI and it's the multitask
multi-max so you open it up I
accidentally cut this open rather than
just open it so and you have three
months in year you've got an
anti-wrinkle cream mask with bee venom
you've got a ready glow exfoliating mask
with brown sugar and then you have a
beautiful egg mask with golden root and
it comes like a really cute brush to put
your face masks on and obviously there's
three little pots are single-use so it's
a great way to try new products or
actually buy in like Phil sighs thanks
oh I don't know if you guys I love
getting stuff like this participant
it makes me pamper myself um Christmassy
rather than kind of faff around all day
out that we face masks on shell what
else you know what it is the next thing
I have is something that I've seen a lot
on kind of beauty guru blogs and
websites and beauty care corns and
things like that is the bloomin
tranquility cleansing balm by Sunday
Rayleigh and it is a huge bed cleanser
and the tiny about red amazing reviews
online so it comes it goes you just open
it up and it smells beautiful
I actually kept the box because it says
exactly what it is it maringá matter
cocoa butter - sugar based cleanser so
does it just check all your oils away
and then at tangerine and sweet orange
essential oils with smell
today trophy free paraben free fragrance
P that's not fragrance free it smells
like the natural things in the actual
bow
it smells great I can't wait to try this
but I can't really I want to see it yeah
look it comes in a really nice a big box
with all the ingredients like the toilet
and you just massage it into your skin
and then remove it using a warm cloth
and it can be used as a state when
cleanser or a hydrating mask the next
thing I have is if you are buying a gift
for someone maybe at work or maybe like
your boyfriend's mum or someone that
you're just maybe not quite sure what to
get them this is my new fifth thing it's
ISA so I'm not actually used this brand
much at all but I saw I always see it in
people's nice bathrooms so on Instagram
and things like that people that have
been to grabbable homes they have stop
with this and it smells me in it but
it's just super chic as no it's really
really nice and if it doesn't wash their
hands hopefully everybody hopefully
everybody washes their hands that I just
thought that this was a really really
nice gift this is just the resurrection
automatic hand wash the reason I got
this one is because it was the best
rated it was that had the highest
reviews and I just thought this is a
really nice gift to get somebody and if
you're not completely sure maybe put
their skin types like or a blah blah
blah makeup you be quiet pears in Israel
and if they're not makeup fanatic you
may get something that's gonna be a
little bit in their comfort zone
everybody wash their hands great choice
the next thing I have is it can tell
this is one of my favorite brands for
candles it's called I don't know how to
say it I've seen neon neon
- they are really really really cute
condos they are all 100% natural
fragrances for the maintenance which is
amazing because
quayle are the teens they're kind of
candles that you get that are really
heavily saint-saëns
they are like no good for you to pretend
you
we believe in that stuff and if you
think about it burned in something it
can releases wherever it's burned into
the ear and then your breathing that in
happy bomb and what can I say I have a
happy mom for her Christmas or her
breath in one year I was looking at
all-natural candles and I found this
brand and I just loved them they've got
a beautiful one with new lolly but you
have this new Christmas range it's
called Christmas wish you open it like
this it's a fans can tell snakes and it
has it really beautiful pull down it's
just speckles of gold it's got the can i
brand it in the phone
mmm and it smells stunning it smells
this is called Christmas wish sprinkled
with 18 karat gold good I'm glad in mind
it in cinnamon and tonka bean it smells
like something that could be a lush oh
it's beautiful
I'm gonna see that Christmas Day who
doesn't love the kinds that transmit
same and that's one just that it does
just melt super Kristin see quite
ceremony so if you like that kind of
thing or you think someone else well
it's a lovely gift the next two things
I've got are just little small things
that I thought were really cute
the first one is a Tony moly mask to
emily is a really great brands buddy
it's Christmas
can you believe it Merry Christmas
your mace so the next thing I have is a
mask from Tony moly 20 molly is a really
cool brand and they do I think it's like
Korean skin caring
obviously lessons and Korean so I can't
read it and I can't really say this word
either but all these masks enemies and I
just picked this one because when I
haven't tried it and it's for skin
purifying which to me means please stop
freaking out which would suit me just
fine at the moment and and yeah they're
just sheet masks you put them on for 10
minutes
amazing stalking fellows they're only
like six pounds each
roughly and but coordinate like cope you
in things like that they've just got
less and less and less of these sheet
masks so I I would just grab a couple
and pop them in some install cane
I just love it I used these probably
like once a week or twice and feeln h to
Boucher I don't think that every single
cattle needs our boy anyone it doesn't
make up needs a beautiful insight so I
have a brand new one
and the beauty blenders are just a great
way to apply your makeup you know stamp
in the sponge and you use it all over I
use it most of my tutorials though I
highly recommend picking up just at
least spare one for someone stocking
they will be eternally grateful because
they're not looking like this did
anything I have is actually part of my
Sephora haul from New York but and I
actually bought myself it for Christmas
so I thought it was a really cute thing
to add into my Christmas gifts ideas so
this is the touch up base the other kit
I started seeing everyone using ketchup
over in the States and I got Superjail
because they don't have it here so when
I was over there I picked up this set
which has the one-step Camila cleansing
oil the Polish classic race enzyme Pozzo
do skin mist and then the suckle
moisturizing rich cream so it comes in a
really cute purple box you open it up oh
and it's just got all the things laid
out nice underneath it's all kind of
these cute sizes to try out so you're
not spending all your money on something
you're not sure if you like you're not
and then you've got the little cannot
best sailor stick the tells you exactly
who to use all the products I see if
they kind of make its thing for last
because it's a bit of a rascal item this
is something I bought for customize
myself two years ago and this is a brand
new set because I need them basically
okay this is the zoeva luxe completes a
15 that brushes and a clutch so I'm
going to open this up so it's weaver
everyone knows is weaver
they're a great brand of brushes they're
really affordable but at the same time
you get your like more than your money's
worth i think the pressure
quality let's get this nice to let
approach and in any place we get cracked
in Russia's so I'm not gonna open all
these up today and if you want obviously
I'll link it down below but this is the
same set that I started my makeup brush
say when they're all artistry standard
brushes I use them all I love them all I
just think they're great I couldn't
recommend a brush day more and also it's
just such a nice gift for someone if
they love their makeup and if they want
to be a makeup artist even if they just
like clean with her own makeup but if
they may not have the right tools Vesta
is just the base it really got me real
on my way to be to make a pair of makeup
artists so I usually excited I take
Cletus and my gift paint the brush you
got really really no need go sleek
they're black and the silver handle
obviously there are other kind of stays
and stuff a link Oldham down below this
and when anyone ever asks me I say a
brushes I recommend I really recommend
these guys you guys will see me use
these and they even have Italy for to to
fall in there mmm-hmm brushes was
something that you were looking at I do
always like my favorite brushes down
