hi guys so fluidity of the D guys are
caused by MC coroner but notice so I'm a
bit nervous
we get enough footage in my laptop when
Jack brings out here at because what
will hopefully I've got it all but I
tried to put photos on my phone from the
SD card and it was really weird like
they were like half the fall was in
black coat very strange any fluidity
should give me a SD cards or vlogging -
no one's going to be completely sane it
woke up a fight this morning across the
jet lag I'm still tired so I've got lot
of leather underneath my eyes and that's
what's good that's what's going to
happen
refill men are lookbook and Iraq's is
not done one before it so I'm going to
give it a good school and but a guy is
here a Fleur and Palin and Anna do
lookbook from the rig and I'm yes so
we're going to go over going to Rancho V
which we don't know what the dressers
because it's exclusive and we had to say
that I think to see that if we get
burned by a rattlesnake we can't see
which is exactly what my plan was I
wanted to get back right now snake quite
YouTube ad sushi I can't do anymore
my face oh my god hi guys welcome back
to my Channel today I will talk about
anxiety mph first of all peer mentoring
them and if you have to their troops and
bridge
obviously very many professionals these
are my favorite things favorite
lyrically cat I got your side show ever
like I spent an overview art and I'm
Erica let's play multiplying people I'm
going to Bellinis out or back Oh
Gabrielle and Nikita look at this
amazing blue hi see that wacky to you
know big stinky dog today's a good day
what happened how in my life
was great I got some nachos
we're not going to music normally on
comics i a essentially take that these
are no clinical kala and see where then
I would understand to the call we
finally flipped and me that oh my god
today they will happen more go to the
tail and then for some reason they don't
have a room journey we hack we like an
extra like around 20 minutes to get your
control room so then I'm using I did
agree graduate an extra hour and 20
minutes to get you can accessible for a
file in here and called our time with JV

worry we were like ha ha yeah she's got
worse
- oh can you hear my voice
we are at the JW Marriott hotel and park
friends yesterday I told you guys we
took at HD air turbulence which is such
a shame of course I just think they're
really basically the quadruple jailer
obviously they had a lot for checking it
so we're really getting at urgent but
everything worked out really fighting
because we got to the festival and put
ed in pain but something that happened
excuse me the prince is too much if
something happens
the triple gala part of me and security
because you're not only that in and I'm
nervous because they can possibly keep
those cameras from me because it does
have a detachable lens but because the
distance with a small camera it should
be fine so I don't know whether to risk
for an upset if I do they'll have to go
all the way to the hotel to the camera
in my room and I'll be annoyed but I
really chose what's the first update
today we're getting ready okay why I'm
going to do some face to the Lumiere cup
because yesterday it was super rustic
we're just so busy suddenly got trying
to do my makeup the way I wanted to so
I'm did it to say that my voice is gone
I want to see you Travis Scott which is
amazing so I was obviously singing and
the voice I've got to know but that's
okay because I feel like a rock star I
just dropped my camera on its face and
it didn't work for about 10 - I can't go
through that again
we're shooting as a new camera because
work heels were amazing enough together
the camera on the plane here at UQ guys
- any cameras when he guessed it is it
and it doesn't have a lens on it but
this camera they could take this off of
me and it's broken
sure is actually broken we're gonna bang
I don't believe you I remember I was it
meant out precisely on a five-part nine
and I'm very I'm possible for Kelly
Michael board and everyone else is like
Kayla and everyone else abortion is
foreign and Alafia and then we create
this first I'm ready
this is where I'm wearing the top of
shorts then a little kind of shirt side
and I wake up about a secular I'll
really curate my makeup so that it can
basically make up I hope you guys like
