going to show you how to do these people
and most of all my god there are three
of my head how did it happen I must
 me
so the Ilyich takes two seconds but it's
amazing for Christ Guam it's really
really a little wedding gift or
something like that and the brave pick
even less pain than that so if you'd
like to see how I choosed a slip
stitches okay let's do it
XS camera doesn't work quite well it
needs me so I'm just struggling on you
know first thing I'm going to do and
obviously prepare my legs with some lien
law I'm going to use my little mulatto
diamond from Real Techniques which is
actually really good but I just prefer
my Beauty Blender
I do prefer my because I do but they're
little little spikes get right in there
you know maybe I want to do in effect my
lead Westby Charlotte Tilbury ear brush
flawless finish and they're super chic -
so even though it looks can a
translucent here it does come in sheets
and I'm just going to set that all over
I have been using the powder under my
eyes been a beacon and it really is
pretty it's not as like heavy fuel in a
map or my face you know never going to
do some shadows no that's it and we use
a little bit mixture of shadows today
I'm going to use some milk cosmetics and
also we need some Charlotte Tilbury as
well so the milk may take a shower what
I'm going to start with and see she'd
the lurk I had to fill it well but
recently I got a really lovely PR
package from mill cosmetics
where what are those shadows and I just
been using them non-stop they're really
beautiful
they're so great so I'm going to use
this first with my Smith - 3 - brush
building that up in the crease and then
I'm going to kind of elevate
open-face obviously this is a really
kind of neutral shade it's a pair of a
transition shade and just I'm just gonna
bringing that up and out to get my eye a
slight lift and the core is my legs nice
and matte it's just glazing on the
products just going along here and
that's pretty much it for that shadow
this is a really quick easy look right
away
the next to nobody went with and this is
rubbish this is my new favorite I've
been using them and you've got me on
Instagram and you look for products I
use you'll see that users use all the
pain so it's good for them at the same
brush and it's going to build that up
and please
so I've got a mirror down here and I'm
just held in my head back slightly and
that way you can really see your crease
and we're working and it makes
everything it's a lot easier and then
I'm going to kind of run out again a wee
bit as well and then people underneath
my eye I'm going to swap my brush to it
these necessarily makes a little small
brush and I'm just going to do my lord i
smoky as usual
and it's really back and forth with my
brush under here it kind of mixes with
any concealer that left over and then
that just means it's going to want all
this all day although and then close we
set out on Drive already quick sweet
tiny file is gone and I see that effect
little shadow is how easy the don't
camera do it and I'm going to go in with
the dolce vita pilot I did or CV tub and
wouldn't use the shades here which is
just it just cold hot I read away
mistake really beautiful called shoot
and my fam dress always say I've got
really long nails just now so it's a bit
annoying but I'm just going to pack that
on to my lead
that's so gorgeous I just love it other
than I've ever found a saddle that can
look quite like this and then I'm
wearing with the sheet here which and
the most gorgeous and her corner
highlight and blue ribbon highlights
some we avoid with my 231 brush from
zoeva and we're just going to pack that
all in this inner corner and then a
little touch just under the blue now
you'll know as to the best eye is a lot
more heavily than this one and that is
because I feel a little bit a question
or talk so these are the eye jewels from
Tarte in the shade white gold you've got
a really enough fine metallic liner type
product here and then you put the
glitter and all I've done as I just got
the blood type and I'm just going to put
a little bit all over and then using my
finger I'm just going to Pat that in
and move around a little bit so it's not
so the lobby I know it's not a technical
term but I've used that term before and
you guys seem to know one tool we have a
back in with the beautiful gold issues
here and I'm just going to put out on
top again because that glitter glue is
quite where it sticks a lot there and it
gives you a really nation so far later
today you'll notice that my latest
actually it cannot include up a lot more
so usually when I do my liner I didn't
really Street over today I've got it
like coming up through into that and I'm
just using my clipper liner and cut one
G as
Farah lashes today I'm going to be using
the twin lash from lovely lashes these
are stunning they're nice and thick one
thing I would say and I would not
recommend eating these if you don't have
lean towards the chorus the band just
really suck going up so it would just be
a better better pallava get in the morn
so I'm just using my favorite do
brush-on glue delete x31 it kind of
looks a little bit blue just going to
put that on first and then apply some
mascara for mascara I'm going to be
using the cyclic mascara from pure I
think I've used in the last few of my
videos now I don't really like it it
builds up enough volume but it doesn't
crumble all to your three stood in the
day and it really is a career - it's
really thick although I will say if you
try it will go over your face because I
was trying at some Art Fair I don't know
something about dogs
I was crying by the little occult me
never left my lash for long enough it's
ready to go on and the cause got an ace
laner it's gonna be super easy so I'm
just gonna pop this one today
I think I feel really pretty look for
eyes
I think it'd be really nice if you were
reading can accommodate or gold
accessories paired and I some said it's
not real and you know clearly up sees
the train and I don't everyone I didn't
do my shows because I wanted to show you
guys how I do don't know because it's
the easiest quickest thing ever so many
are left by Relativity and this shiz
Canady color building same color girl so
I'm going to go under right here and
start at the front and it's what is
almost like a BH very designer but I
just think it's softer and easier to use
so I'm just going to under here making
sure that nice and chunky man control it
and then I'm going to swap over to just
above March and see straight wait
they're already better
oh just use your finger and put that
mistake away only the mistakes made in
life or it's easy to get rid of
and they fell down I go through the
bravest disabilities to make sure is
nice and diffused and then go in with a
v8 bro jail I really do love this stuff
it's just super solid keep the reason
and please wait for the boat and I like
to meet these periods to stand up a
little bit more black tape for both and
when you use relatively legendary blows
and machinery I said this wrong last
time kappa k dies obviously color
because it goes too far
anyway I call that character and
apparent up Institute and no in another
language so I would need to share cotta
and the legendary bro jail and this is
just really really nice and dark and it
kind of seconds up the here Israel you
guys are quick kids look at its may feel
anything and that's the finished look so
much for my eyes everyone develops and
I'll be right back ok that many tennis I
just used the lip pencil from urban
decay and the she'd start naked which is
really nice and a pinky nude and then I
use Haven Gail color lip and cheek from
from nude spectrum really made sheer can
lipstick but it gives a nice color so
you guys I hope you liked this quick I
took it does somethin Apple it was
really really quickly
obviously it neutrals so if you don't
like neutral look I'm really sorry but
you just start for your whole Mutual's
eye tutorial please do comment
underneath if there's anything that you
guys want to see that need more colorful
and if you've got 12 hours rails

recreate some of those but today I just
