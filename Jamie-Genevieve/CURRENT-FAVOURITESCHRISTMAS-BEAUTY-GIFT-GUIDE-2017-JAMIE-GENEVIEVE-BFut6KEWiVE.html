I am doing a gift guide and I know that
I'm really really it's the twin is it
the same bro I am late to the game 1x1
by I asked you guys on Twitter if he's
telling me to do it and you all said yes
I know all of you will have your
presents already and things like that
but this is almost like a little kind of
favourites video for me as well because
when I was kinda collecting these
products together I was just trying to
think what would I be really excited to
open on Christmas Day what kind of
products that I think it's cool that
kind of stuff so I've got a bunch of
stuff here it's just like my favorite
things it's things that I think are
really nice for a gift all different
places as well it's all beauty products
more sleep but it's in a range of
products a range of gifts that I would
be really excited for and then some
things I've got here are more just like
a kind of general brand idea that I
think would be really cool to get some
guests from if you're watching this as a
subscriber think of X just like I can a
favorites video obviously you might see
some favorite things in here that you
can write down for your Christmas list
or something like that if you are a
family member or something like that of
my subscriber then hello welcome I'm
gonna help you for Christmas everything
that I talk about it's gonna be less
than thin below along with places so you
can have a look I will do my best to
find places that are going to deliver in
time for Christmas if you were to order
these things tonight so I'm sure that
the last deliveries and things that are
over the next couple of days hopefully
we're not too late so I'm just gonna get
into it I'm not going to go too much
into the products I'm just going to show
you them and tell you why I like them
and where I think they'll make a good
gift
so the first products I'm going to talk
about are from a brand called glossy a
glossy is a really cool new brand that's
just come to the UK I absolutely love
this stuff if you are a beauty junkie
you will have heard of this brand
already these two are the body heel
products which is a perfecting cream
which is like a moisturizer for the body
and then you've got your daily oil wash
a really beautiful shower cuttings or
bath cleansers these three products are
awesome but honestly glossy as a brand
general have a lot look at their website
the stuff is amazing it performs so well
I have yet to find something that I try
that I think no that's not for me I've
really liked everything another product
from them that I think surely kill is
the glossy BAM calm this is just like a
nice Universal lip balm whatever balm
you can put it anywhere really really
like a really cute little stocking
filler or just something that is cool
brands the cool thing for Christmas
absolutely love their stuff the next
product is something that I talk about
on my channel all the time if you are
watching this video and you have watched
other ones before you love heard me
speak about the nude photography fluids
opacity 12% is the most beautiful primer
and it's basically like a really nice
shove it on the skin it's unreal
underneath foundation and it looks
stunning in photography everyone that I
have seen that spotless because of me
absolutely loves it it's just one of
those products at amazing it's 20 pounds
if you're purchasing for someone who
does watch my videos they will be super
proud of you for annoying to get this
product is just phenomenal it's amazing
the next two products are lip products
and I've got two here they are both from
Santa Beauty Santa Clau a universal
gloss and we also have the standout lip
paint and this is in the shade
uncensored both of these products are
huge online right now they're both went
viral I really can both this one here is
a nude gloss and that's when here is
more of a matte Sammy matte lip paid
which is super pigmented so depending on
what kind of person you are one of these
in a stocking or as a gift is so great
really nice for a secret santa or
something like that as well I know you
can pick these up online but you can
also get them at Harvey Nichols
absolutely love these I would be so
excited if someone was clever enough to
know how much I would love this and Russ
talking because it's a really cool brand
it's just new this year these are great
both of them next I have little
eyeshadow palettes these are by food of
beauty and I've got three different ones
here these are the obsessions palettes
there are only 25 pounds and n side you
get named shades a little mixture of
matte and shimmer they are all super
gorgeous this one here is the electric
obsessions which is obviously really
really bright that you're not dive into
this one yet but if you know someone
that
really break colors or you yourself late
break colors this would be perfect
this one here is the more of obsession
so if you know something that likes
really nice perfectly tollens panky
tones the next one would be perfect for
them and then the one that I have used
the most and a lot of FD worn Brown
obsessions s palette is absolutely
gorgeous I had a few friends this year
asking me for help and what to buy their
Secret Santa or their friends and this
is the first palette that I went to it's
just beautiful it's so good for everyday
it's a really nice little size perfect
for me for traveling so I use it all the
time and I just think these pallets are
really sweet the next thing I have here
are eyelashes so we've got a pair from
head of beauty these are these Samantha
lashes they're my favorite lashes from
the huda beauty range they're gorgeous
they're synthetic the last loser uses as
well I just think lashes is a really
nice little thing for a stocking filler
again or as a little gift I think these
are really cute and then the other
lashes I have here are the Lele lashes
and Miko knows I wear these all the time
the are low and what expensive at 30
pounds but they do last up to 20 uses
and if you look after them maybe even
more but I use these lashes all the time
so for someone that watches my channel
or you guys yourself if you wants you to
create any of my licks these are the
lashes that I usually wear for really
dramatic looks these ones are more
dramatic the Samantha lashes it a little
bit more natural but both are really
really nice if you just need a filler or
your budget is quite small a nice thing
to look at our sheet masks so these are
some of my favorite ones I absolutely
love this egg cream mask I think this is
by too cool for school it's a really
nice little face mask I think it's only
five pounds so it's a really nice
silicon filler or just something that
you can shove in with a gift I really
like these bubble masks are really fun
again something that went really really
vital this year so this is the bubble
sheet by galangal glam glow is so famous
for face masks and things like that so
it's definitely a brand that everyone's
heard from just really like these ones I
think are really fun really deep
cleansing and then the last one I've got
here as the snail Kerr the Tony moly
intense care snail jail hydro mask I
think this is about
so the less that they blow all these
masks are just really really well known
in the kind of beauty community and
they're really well known for being good
the next thing I've got here are the
dose of call our callers because the
colors are spelled American these are
the dose of colors let's say so NSAIDs
each one this is the Snuggle is real set
and save each one you get three little
lipsticks these are the matte liquid
lipsticks from dulce colors I actually
have this one as cold let's cuddle very
sweet but that's not as gorgeous like
I'm really excited I'm gonna take out
right now because this is for me
obviously you can see that this knit
I've got one just like a really really
nice peachy knit then you've got more of
a pinky and then you've got more of a
kind of brandy move and then you've got
more of a pinky one here so these are
really nice notes and then the other one
we have here is the Holly base eight
which is more red so you've got a kind
of dark plum I've got a darker pinky red
and then you've got a darker to it I
know you can get those the colors on the
UTB I'm sure but what I'll do is I'll
look up the base website there is a
chance that you can only get these from
district colors in which case I'm not
sure if they would arrive in time for
Christmas but I just thought these days
we're really really cute the next thing
I had in my gift guide last year just
because they are always relevant and
never going out of style and is the
beauty blender so they really cute thing
about beautifully I don't know is that
you get saw many different colors I had
another run through all the cocoon
so you got your blue orange you've got
your kind of pink marble your great
beauty blender Pro which is black
they're just really really sweet I love
these and say the stalk and everyone
knows how beautiful in today's everyone
uses be playing toys
I think it's just a really nice guest
that's definitely gonna please I always
like a new Beauty Blender and that
leaves me on to my next product which is
the blotter Ozzy by beauty plain dark
and I actually really really like this
because inside you'll see it's got a
matter here you've got your little pouch
here your little pad and what you do is
you can just blow away any excess oil
and when I am open about I always have
this
me and forever lip color that I'm
reading and that's all I need to touch
up the cause that's just brought to be
the oil but it also mix I don't really
just can push your foundation back and
you can care smooth out any lane so I
will use it under my eyes and things
like that it's so simple but it's so
good the next thing is skin care skin
care guest and I have two guests here
from Kiehl's if you good thing about
keels as it's available in so many
different stores that you can just go in
and get these things from and obviously
I'll link away to get these things
online as well that's when you here is
the high-flying gentleman recharge and
refuel from toe to toe with our complete
getting cure squadron any year you have
a face wash moisturizer a body wash and
you get a shave lotion as well which is
just a little small one this is so so
sweet for the guy obviously I'm gonna
give this to Jack
obviously giants ed and they're sure you
know they already know so that's one
present ribbond but I absolutely love
these the common in these poachers
honestly see when I travel all my makeup
and things like that or in these pouches
almost skin care and stuff I love using
these pictures for when I'm traveling I
said I create really really good for
overnight it's really good for holidays
kills it's just such a good skin care
brand it's so names and this stuff even
though it's for guys Gators can use it
as well there's like a studies show that
men don't buy the same products as women
and life sort of like blue or black or C
for men on them but these products are
to pull the unit's a its but I just
think this is a really nice way to get
your guy and his skin care if he's not
already and that leads me on to my next
one it's such a shame because these came
from Kiehl's PR and you see that this
one's got really cute back right that's
one it's missing but this does come
really really cute pockets as well and
here this is another skincare saying I
just need to get the name of it
that's it yours with love the skincare
set 5 it's fine it's got so in here you
get your ultra facial cleanser which is
gorgeous I use this a lot when I'm
traveling so I've got lose a little
minis of it you also get your ultra
facial moisturizing cream I used to use
this all the time until I started
playing a bit with otherwise the 30ml
size of the red Navy
the concentrate I absolutely love first
laws of you guys have went and got this
because of me and see that you love it
too I use it all the time still I've
been back is that again it just so
happens my skin's back to be an amazing
coincidence think not you get the cutest
that will dearly reviving concentrate
and a little travel but which is just my
favorite thing ever and again you get it
all and a really nice Super Bowl pouch
which is just gonna it's the seeds to a
bag it's so easy to keep your toiletries
and stuff and I just think that both of
these six are absolutely brilliant and
then obviously because these things are
NSA you save quite a lot of money by
getting the same and not the individual
products so kills you're winning you're
winning a Christmas the next thing I
have is another product that I think
would be really really good for you guys
if you watch a lot of my videos or if
the person that you're buying for
watches a lot of my videos but this is
the you Tennant own coconut chaning
water this is the product that gives me
a really nice glow in my skin all your
own and summer I do go home with this
and I spray all over my neck and chest
and face and basically it's a really
nice little built-in fake tan it smells
like coconuts doesn't smell like feet
and I just absolutely love it
and I know that Lords you guys totally
sphere by the snow the only problem is
it sails out a lot now which is annoying
to me a new book that I absolutely
spirit by this stuff my next product is
a makeup bag no you don't obviously get
all the makeup that's in this bag but I
have been using this buy this is from
the skinny dip and I've been using this
bag since I got governor and it is so
good because it's so back it's like a
really nice big bag but the best thing
about it is when you unzip it at first I
was like a moment to get my hand like in
and out here
but it pops up it makes its or or pen
that you can actually set your bag up
like this and you can fit so much makeup
in it because of this as well you don't
have any restrictions but you're done
you just close it back over zip up your
bag it's honestly the best makeup bag
aerosol something that I really liked
and it Christmastime if I'm getting
people like a few bets a few million cut
boots a few skincare bits I'd like to
put it in a wash bag or makeup bag or
something
I'll use it for child and twice already
and I can set my filthy sand here no
problem and that's a lot coming from me
next one I have here's me but we owed
and there's another present I've got for
genetic which is just annoying but this
is a pure bank and I absolutely love
Maine some maintenance is great here
it's a bit dirty but I've got this
really cute white one with the gold
sides and as a portable battery and it
charges your phone up Litzy details
dinner what I like about it it's so
small and late because I had another
battery pack it was so huge and heavy
and I just here taking it everywhere
this one's amazing it's only 13 pounds
from Amazon and you can get it on Amazon
train so it comes like super quick
everyone needs one the next two products
I have are here clear and this is
brand-new here carrots by Sam McKnight
and these are the coolest hair products
ever
I love we I love we loads and loads and
loads I think it's really really cool
and I really love Janet King as well but
these products are so amazed and they
smell so good
the packaging is so cool I've got a
couple of them here like I use them all
the time if you were to get someone a
gift I know you can get this on coke
beauty but if you were to give someone a
present I would give them the cool get
old texturizing spray which is
unbelievable really really good for
making you here sucker it smells great
it's a nice big tub it's not cheap but
it's not crazy expensive I though I
would say it's the same kind of places
as we and then you also have the Lisa
kettle dry shampoo these two products
are so stunning it's just like a new
brand as well so it's not really been
spoken about much but I guarantee it's
gonna blow up over the next little while
it's already totally blown up but I love
these hair products so much and I just
think the packaging is really cool it's
all kind of pastels but if you're in a
gold trim just beautiful
I've got two more products and the first
one is e perfume this is the amber
perfume by laboratory perfumes and this
is one of my favorite smells ever at
Jack I absolutely love set I absolutely
love it it's totally unisex people
compared it to creat a low and if you
don't know what cleaners it's this
amazing aftershave that costs like 300
pounds this one does not cost your
underpants
it costs sixty five pounds which is
still on the kind of more expensive end
but you do get a hundred
no and honestly it's just the most
beautiful perfume ever when I wear this
I get stopped all the time people ask me
what it is all the time boys love it
ghettos love it it's just like a really
good old room don't em I don't even know
how to explain it because that Keith is
just so different and so is this but
that's perfume honestly it's great it's
not I wouldn't even call it like a pair
of him is an Eau de toilettes I actually
love it so much that I bought the candle
as well but I've not let the candle yet
I'm saving it and then the last last
products I'm going to talk about our
candles these are the veil of Freud
candles they are not cheap there are 45
paints each but they are so luxurious
and gorgeous I've got two here I've got
one that's actually like right now this
is called lion and then this one it is
the bill at Freud candle you can get
these on coke beauty as well they're 45
quid each like I said I think quite a
lot of you guys are the same as me my
favorite kind of smells
I like smoke layer though it's super
like musky like it's I don't know how to
explain it but it's like a super rich
intense expensive smell and I just
absolutely love them these candles are
my favorite they're so like luxury like
I might even let this one yeah and it
smells amazing like I just always have
it here I'm sure you've seen these my
favorite kinds was by far they are
compatible to like that teak and I
actually prefer these ones the depth
teak I really loved that secret I just
feel like these have that little touch
of luxury that I would like in a 45 pen
candle that was quite a lot of talking
these are just literally a handful or
quite a lot of my favorite products
right now products that I would be
really excited to get over the kind of
Christmas time even when I'm sitting
