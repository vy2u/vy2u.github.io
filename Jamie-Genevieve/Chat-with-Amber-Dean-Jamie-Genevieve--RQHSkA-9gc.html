hi guys of my channel this week we are
back I say we because I'm with my friend
amber am Dean and I'm Brad is visiting
me from Barcelona
you will hear shortly that she is not
from Barcelona she is from the states
the United States so amber is over
Virginia master class tomorrow and we
thought we'd just have help up later
what does bladder mean yeah good job all
these shiny new words oh this always
shiny new the captivity and when she was
back to somewhere this piece more
English maybe the barceló garden even
years all these words and I'm gonna be
like oh you're so troubled but no one's
gonna understand you later today we're
gonna be having a chat and yeah we just
really hope you enjoy and I can't tell
if I've got pine guys or smokey eyes
it's being a onesie no I think they just
smokey Panther so amber has been to that
school I mean once before
yeah but just for like a hot British
like a D and then Nina ever made
hopefully emulate I don't know yeah and
then the tell Evan DS ago in London and
there's a few things that I like to
count abuse means that IRL we've been
like in sir friends for a while now yeah
we can change something forever it feels
like and there's a few things I've said
that ever has no idea like I said that
gives me book and she was like the book
the book what's the book and I was
saying mistake it makes me so soft or
amber the government work means I'm a
loser
and talked to each other like see if
your chops with something means that
you're like happy that you're happy but
do you guys know Scottish slang I feel
like it's not as well-known obviously
American slang everybody knows yeah well
that's because there's information films
yeah I can't stump you on that one yeah
well you see I don't know because he
went out watch Scottish films
I get really clenching if I hear another
Scottish accent I'm like but then
obviously the sounds that you grew up
watching are forced his name by making
films all of them so are you quite used
to getting American people on TV and I'm
something solely see what that's party
yeah so that's probably quite we're
better at you're not saying and you
Polly like some when was the first thing
you hear - Scottish accent that's fast
wake up we could see the first time I
had an immense night and was like
doesn't he so I'm sure that there's me
aids man Kade yeah a lot of our
conversations have been like I turned 19
ask Albert do you have to overdose pizza
and she was like that was me the
language barriers though all the time I
keep asking her to repeat ourselves
she'll say like I'm used to her saying
girls like
ghettoes them with her yes with her
Scottish Twain but I always thought
getting over for the first few days I
thought she's saying ghettos Gettle yeah
so you think I was going all those get
too loose yeah by many
gonna ask you like over and over again
to repeat something that you have to
like put on the American accent yeah
that's something that every literally
helps if I can all understand poverty
and I'm just going American accent and
go oh my god
I mean girls oh my god come over here
come over here to me screaming good
stuff but yeah if I needed really hard
not to quote the our tactical team
because I think it's me scent and they
get so much fun and I find it really
hard to copy her I think I'm in it yeah
it's not as hard I wish it's hard I can
I think I can do English but I probably
still sound stupid when I do it can you
do New York I can do like an old Jewish
smoker from like Long Island go honey
you're lucky I love you come here you
look hungry honey honey come here
yeah like hungry you're lucky I love you
like come here Amba having yourself
sweet
I hate freshmen but you're lucky I love
you honey you let Mia love you well
that's own that they might even send my
boys conversation you've had is a in
Greer's custody and SS estate no no a
society member we were talking about the
population of Scotland and the nice I
said he looked at San Diego he said yeah
but that's a state right you didn't
notice a small thing in a large state am
ta my geography
I realized is really bad but we're
getting here I only know what geography
because I've been in certain places like
if it applies to my life yeah I know
like for example oh I've never been to
Asia like any Asian country so it's like
one big mess over there
I just don't know where anything is yeah
but now all these European countries
because I've been here for so long I
know but before I got here like I had no
idea about anything does it feel small -
yeah really small because everything to
me feels massive because I'm from tiny
little Scotland today I feel safe and
happy
five million small people they have all
these numbers here is because she is
staying with me for a few nights and we
have class tomorrow so even though me
and amber are busy to say the least
Doka ready for you not much new makeup
but she's better at that than me I'm
such a slacker yeah I never had the
channel obviously which I've got a link
down below with her Instagram zero which
is the main site

bad at uploading anything because I live
