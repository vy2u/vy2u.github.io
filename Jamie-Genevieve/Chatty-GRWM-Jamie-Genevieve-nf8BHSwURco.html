going to just chill and get ready
together because last week I saw a lot a
few comments saying that more sick of my
like little short videos with tutorials
which I can totally understand I would
get bored after watching fear those so
today we're going to be ready together
I'm going to talk nonsense I don't know
how that much talk about to be
everything seems to people in old age or
apart from my dog drawbar being nice
life is good life as well and I was
saying you'll hear me see and the
cameras so there's a few things that I
need you to call me below but you need
to tell me about cameras you need to
tell me what kind of videos you need to
tell me when and f you like me to vlog
and I would like to know what you want
me to walk about and I'd like to know
vertical entire lines going to go and
those are the main things I'm sure I'll
mention more things through it vigil but
those are the things I would like to see
down in the comments feel free to number
them 1 2 5 and give me appropriate
answer it's like an app like a pop quiz
or a taste
yeah this bill in case so as you do that
I would just be deleted and as always I
will like everything I use down below in
the description box
ah if you'd like to see how I got ready
to be please featured this is the extent
of the here that I do or the other boots
s so takes about 10 seconds and but if
you like to hear I got my make up to
date and what we talk absolute nonsense
patient nice get made it together
I had a hellish morning you you know I'm
so sorry baby Joel but my monies to get
written it don't you steal anything
going when I go please please just call
my going let me just quickly explain a
few things
you ain't notice that I am rather
swollen and
and I'd love my eyes that would be
because my beautiful puppy Drogba
decided to throw a bone at my head with
his mane and it had me literally square
between ID and its age really sore it's
really sore and then when I thought I
couldn't love him anyways he peed all
over my bed all over my bed so I've been
ready to film for about three hours and
I had a Gore and changing wash my sheets
because they were covered in dog pee
which is delightful
so yeah apart from that everything is
just hunky-dory I haven't even done one
of these before so I am just gonna start
talking but let's do makeup at the same
time so this is my new fear thing
this is luscious new moisturizer called
magical merengue it's amazing it's quite
late it's quite solid so it feels almost
like a solid oil and then when you put
it on it is matte you will need a little
bit as real and it's like a matte
moisture day so that's a trainer as well
and I am completely obsessed so yeah
guys I'm not really interesting I'm not
that interesting what can I tell ya so
if you've got me on Twitter which is G
me underscore Genevieve you may have
seen me talking about maybe vlogging in
the future which is a bit nuts for me
but yeah and thank you very much
they CA I'm gonna go use my Anastasia
Beverly Hills and Diplo poor meat
anesthesia as I would call her because
I'm not American I'm just going to use a
little Mac to with angle brush and my
depth range really starts to dry out so
I've just been mixing it with inglot
duraline and has been similar so let's
just start doing that I've pretty much
narrowed it down to two different
cameras I'm really sporty really a poor
Joe sport blues
I have tweeze my leg off by accident
it's okay it's okay
would you look together the camera at me
are going to get the canon g7x or the
sony e5 100 if you got either of those
cameras let me know let me know what one
is good and all I need it for as to take
pictures for Instagram because I am so
over using my fault it's my least
favorite thing in the world
so taking pictures for Instagram and for
recording vlogs which would be fun don't
really know what I'm gonna vlog about
considering I'm not interesting yeah if
you're going ideas for that as well let
me know the coins I don't know what blog
but I know some of you wanted to see my
house I've not done that yet cause my
house is I'm hey it's an absolute riot

lot of work done like I need a new
kitchen I need a new bathroom I need it
rewired well so needs painted floors

floor is all sanded see it literally

boyfriend calls as what jack says he
says it's a light and ski or junk
because I love clutter
I just thank you when you own like
someone's house and its pristine I get
nervous a bit setting down in your bear

so as you look slightly different
because but in your glam all the
everyday then you're not glad everyone
thinks that you're dying of I'm really
serious illness and I have to see people

moisturizer on as my trainer I'm gonna
go in with L my skin base as always I'm
gonna do my foundation X which I you
don't usually do but I've started doing
it recently because it makes me tackle
my eye makeup a bit differently which
I'm trying to do it because the one was
to be the same all day and I'm just you
hi leo brush from Illamasqua to roughly
blame that end before at beauty blend
over top I love this foundation this
foundation gives new life it gives me
life
I just cannot roughly buff that then
when I'm going to want you to read it

just gonna cover it in the face okay
roughly got that on I'm going to go
anyway so provided I my camera look so

think this may be the darkest shade and
I'm going to go in with my Beauty

like 17 and I was like a delinquent I
was too young then enjoy it I don't
enjoy it but I didn't do anything I
didn't like travel about anything like
that so I'd really like to see more best
time so if any of you know where to go
first good please let me know so I mean
Jack can go and have fun together and
I'm just going to go over that BB cream
with Real Techniques Real Techniques

the foundation so it's not as obvious I
love this stuff I mean like her braid I
am oh I totally will just use like a BB
cream and whole day I talked about like
its next week I'm actually not going to
wait for another week five antigens and
disgusting like up I wonder what we know
I'm just going to go in with a lot about
the foundation silly
during my hand I'm just going to tidy up
that contour perfect okay let's try a
brand new product this is Jade are to
kiss me at X star powder and Audrey like
the name of the Audrey Hepburn and I'm
really buzzing to try this so I'm just
going to go on top of my cheeks I'm just
using a Smashbox fan brush when my new
feeds oh hi
this is good ah oh look oh good that
holy crap look at me to say good job
Jared cosmetics this is genuinely the
first okay this my feeds Wow
oh hey so yeah make one bigger go this
is like what identity I've got a couple
of points at masala one at leat later on
that's pretty much all identity and they
record in this video obviously and
putting it up on the tube but apart from
that I'm killing today there's this
really good day I'm obsessed with this
everyone should ask me what's on my face
and we was going to ask me one of my
things fab video log sit up but wealth
changes are that you know I'm so used to
grinning like soft and gentle which is
super pain this definitely makes for a
new sheet and I like that it's got this
to stop it from smashing - I want your
join your league clip over that little
plastic better name you cause cute
packaging I'll get I'll get them that to
have that as well hey let's do wear eyes
so I'm going to use Elizabeth Arden
advanced iFix primer this is amazing by
the way and all those beside is like I
know people don't really think about it
as me crap as much but it's actually
good that we could put that on over just
using my little finger is anybody else
get really up to the post mine doesn't
come they got all the gigs I earned that
I thing I don't know
making a postcard or something I get
nothing
also the put fun definitely comes for
every time the de France sees it now
these two always be here affluent school
if you were getting post you know you
know that you were getting at free with
skill what their friends why different
different day a different generation my
poplar is like the wolf highlighted
going the world and I love it
okay let's do the eyes Berkeley huge I'm
not using ages the Vegas leads pilot by
makeup geek beautiful so I'm going to
start off with the sheet Mirage which is
like the latest one like everything see
on top of this play right and just going
so smooth it just sticks like straight
way it's amazing putting a little bit of
that later shade on my brows born rule
do this like a minimum a cream know
what's wrong with me I'm supporting and
we're going to color desert sands which
is this one here and it's just like a
really nice matte camel color so we're
going to Matt first and I'm we go right
in the crease I love that shades they
don't do that so over drag that color
underneath my eye I think as soon as you
do that he looks a week at so bright
gorgeous like Jordan I died back
underneath to cover your real eye bags
I am absolutely upstairs for Jaclyn hill
at the woman I think she is my spirit at
all see the push day with what's in her
title bag I'm gonna go buy all see but
cooking blown away somewhere I just want
to prepare myself properly for the first
time I want to have like a phone charger
a little portable one I want to have an
exhale ones for the plane
I'm switch so good let's leave that
there so go ahead with a little bit
lighter shade Mirage again and just go
over my lid make that super bright and I
think okay I like a corner to do
I'm going to use a small mouth is really
small but it's deluxe crease brush
receiver and I'm going to go in with the
sheet better being which is just here
and I'm gonna darken up my outer corner
but just a little so I'm just talking
about crease and the outside a little
bit I think I'm going to bring it the
shadow up a little bit yeah so I'm just
get my breath and just flick 1/8 the
corner a little bit just so it's not
surround let's go ahead right guys this
is a new thing that I'll test both now
blow you might have heard me talk about
them before this like Italian dragon
shows in Milan and magic pencil is like
I can see their pencil but it's the only
thing that is second off to actually
probably paint the waterline clean color
which me drives up massive sort let's do
that it's the Bears it's so great you
can use a full range of reason to
presume I think it's a bet wait for that
and let them scatter I'm going to use
the Mac up for - and black which is the
one with the tiny little brush I mean
some eyelashes I don't mix on my wedge I
stuck to a piercing yellow that I'd worn
already in old order b-17s and it'll be
one Sensex I'm sure there's been some
clumsy searches ok let's wait for the
brush to dry so I'm planning to do more
videos I'm doing Linda need you guys
help with ideas so I think a like it has
any specific videos you want to see like
I make to another makeup collection one
that was quite I've actually never done
that before but mainly talk you through
I've got this is like all modeling stuff
I have here and then I've got all my cat
in the salad so maybe I could take my
camera and do a video in this at one and
I can show you how like I store my cat
and stuff like that we could do a hair
tutorial with jasmine who works in onyx
with me where I've got
I thought if you've got if you've got me
on instagram you'll have seen it before
but it's like they make votes it'll dry
we could do that flattered if you really
want to see it I will show I think I can
even do like a room a time or something
like that that's pretty very lashes on I
can do like a video with my favorite
brushes actually that might be a good
one because I'm quite obsessive brushes
is these lashes even stuck together to
the band cleats echoing on which is much
better if you've got a later on and I've
not done actually whoa oh my god they
might feel good that is genuinely the
best eyelashes are over warm life and I
made them Cadle okay let's do lips I
have another new thing jarred cosmetics
Hydra matte lip color and serenity so as
I kinda panic but I feel like I know you
a punk I'm away I know that I've bought
camping here I love it so we're going to
start off by lining light with Charlotte
Tilbury all up sheet and iconic nude
fever lip liner edwood boom
look at the difference okay
Nevers later let's a lot let's go in
with this lip color I got to write this
year very excited
