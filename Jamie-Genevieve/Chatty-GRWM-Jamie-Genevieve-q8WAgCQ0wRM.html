so sorry am i looked at my youtube
channel at the last thing that i
uploaded was me and sounds cuny which
seems like a long time ago
let's just see that but a lot happens
and in I've been in Thailand velocity
weeks but yeah today I'm just going to
get ready we'll use some new stuff I'm
just gonna chat with you guys because I
miss you
I make sure Lords and we've not done
this for a long time I'm just gonna get
started you know who I'm gonna actually
do my skin first I picked up Marc Jacobs
foundation and for that in pates I get
to direct for me but no actually it's
going to be too late because I am a
grown little beer I'm a brown beer I'm
peeling ah my skin is flaking and I just
brought my camera for the millions time
just the era in trying to hook this guy
up and I'm upset brought up to tell the
truth so what I'm gonna do well that's
Marc Jacobs foundation and it comes up
with this little dropper right and you
may put four doors on that's not a
foundation for me but I'm going to do
maybe I'll be bit more than that and
then I'm going to make it a darker
foundation when it makes it with skin
because I've got a dark skin B so I can
use it so let's just do this
oh no yeah it's gonna be too late that's
not five dollars that's about a million
dollars but mama likes coverage and I'm
gonna get my smash one one five brush
this is the ultimate foundation brush by
the way it's changed my life needs a
wash but in we'll do that later and I'm
just going to go into the local loads of
God of skin visa darker version the
darker one yeah I'm going to need that
and I'm just kind of putting that in
this space so everyone's going to hope
it plays together this is the story my
wall has a lot of coverage and I have
too much quadrature for me Wow
you do not need any of that foundation
I've made an error crap ray okay let's
play sportsman so
you don't need that much okay guys and
so yay if you follow me on Instagram or
Twitter or YouTube or anything you
probably know that I was in Thailand for
a couple weeks here with my boyfriend
and we had been a vampire over two days
and no child oh just the kind of holiday
we were needing to be honest the bull
food working pretty hard and so it was
really nice
not much to report from there we just
had the best time ever
some bees swam in the sea this is the
wrong color
haha I'm gonna go over my lips cuz
they're pick me off
holy sh h holy great I'll go be a good
color at once
I've got bronzer on okay it's a good
coverage the color dye uses light beige
late beige is too late okay
you guys it's just nice to see the pros
say some things okay thank you some work
out till stop and so I'm so happy to be
home so happy to be home happy to be
back to work happy to be recording again
even though I just put my camera I'm
kinda ignoring the fact that just
brought my camera because that's like
for hemorrhoids not six months out bloke
who plays just the lens but yeah I've
got I'm just recording on my Sony just
now let me know where that size cuz see
if it's good I'll just use this it
probably will take half as much time
uploading it onto my channel as well
just pull the other thing okay if I've
learned anything from that experience
John used Marc Jacobs foundation the
wrong way with instructions and put four
dots on your face because I this is the
most coverage I've wore since a little
bit 15 years old I'm going to warm this
up I got a new
blusher from Stila and it's heaven it's
Haven it's Matt it this is actually
Fieldy contouring bronzer and nice and
it's this is the Lake but it's
perfect for me so I'm going to go ahead
and warm this up today
ba-ba-ba-ba the names like make sure
that you still in the house sometimes
whirring kisses opened the door and left
the building they mom I'm done
this yeah you guys not much else to
report
apart from I was at the gyms morning for
the first time every two years and it
was really difficult
yeah I was really difficult but then it
last day long but you know what's and
I've signed up I've got a year's
contract which is just about as much
commitment as I can handle
so yeah I'm going to try and go to the
gym more I'd like to get fat and healthy
see how that's just bringing it to life
everything's going to be okay I should
call this video how to fix your makeup
when start school all this bronze out
head yeah so I'm upset about breaking
mccannon but I actually have good vibes
about this Shani
maybe it's going to be better maybe it
will be just the same because it's a lot
easier to work with so yeah video is
wise what you can expect in the next
little while when I was in Bangkok I
went to Sephora and I bought some stuff
so I'm gonna do a little hole and I'd
love for you guys who just like me to
underneath what could have ideas you'd
like to see and guys I'm not done
anything she really ah recorded wasn't
any this year apart from my cutie of Sam
oh let me talk about that so I began in
a year before I went to Thailand I was
in London in Paris with Samantha who I
have talked about a lot many times many
times before I went to me oh it's weird
me speaking about run over clothes she's
a friend
no we text often it's weird
I still feel sometimes a little bit find
girly but in I don't know I just I think
she's just such a positive great person
to have um she worked hard she does the
same thing as me online and things like
that it's nice to have someone that you
can relate to and talk about your work
with so yeah that was one of the
highlights of the year glad to say
because that you just started but you
know it was amazing so yeah I'm really
buzzing I'm gonna I'm not going to be
uploading every Thursday anymore I'm
going to be uploading as in Wayne so
some weeks maybe you'll get to video
some weeks maybe you'll get three videos
some reaps
get any because it's a crazy week so it
just frees up my schedule a little bit
more and so if I'm talking beard I was
at the Danish the game and they all know
how I feel that it's in it's not good
not good and yes it's the same tooth
it's the same to that guy and it's
hurting me right now I'm really I'm
going to just start recording I think
probably more in general and it's going
to be great
Oh totally peel and occlude the my brows
first as well because libraries kick me
around 20 minutes today Queen I'm
feeling like doing them properly
I'm not being carving them out as much
these days and CA I can't write C
because I was still like it so I did it
off camera because it does take me a
long time and I'm not gonna put that
lovely in law and you know I want to put
some of this Liam or Mac Paint Pot all
over my lid just use my fingers for that
because that's why I dunno because you
get much more evenly R which I did not
know do is dim tools the bournemouth so
yeah I didn't know what was in my my
makeup today and it's absolutely in the
D it's with your clock and afternoon but
you know I had stuff to do this morning
Dan asked dog gem so I had a bath I had
a midday bath watch some TV in the bath
I don't have a TV in my bathroom I use
my laptop propped up on towels as we all
do and over to the nice so I'm just kind
of easing myself back in and watch more
left for holidays
cuz I think if I went straight back to
working as much as I was at Christmas
time I would have a small mental break
oh that's okay as well okay I don't know
what to do
hey I'm winning one that's just what I
do what I don't know what to do
I wore a tie look at my Instagram and
late hmm whatever not done recently well

nice detail look yellows do that this is
one of my little treats that I got
myself and supporter in which I'll be
featuring in my haul but I got the
target
