get up if you didn't know I lost my
camera and Ailee alone with my passport
and probably the remaining shades of
humanity that I'd like so that's why I'm

and could I bought the camera earlier
yes did I know what are you doing for
sir um oh you try to condition well if
you guys follow me you'll know that I've
been on the hunt for the perfect
foundation for about seven years now and
I've yet to find a foundation that I
love the most that does like everything
I wanted to do I don't know that it's
out there but anyway so today I'm trying
a different one I'm trying luminous silk
which I've actually tried before but I
just didn't like the color range all
that much but I'm trying that one and
I'm mixing it with their maestro cloner
she
fusion makeup bi-phase elixir ox tonight
sunscreen broad-spectrum SPF 30 which is
that what I look for in a five so
anyways I'm gonna try to mix them and
see how that goes okay I suspect it'll
be very doing I'm going to use AA
favorite of me make our ultimate
coverage complaining cream someone asked
me a few people have asked me what
colored I am I am nude and it's pretty
perfect if I'm honest all you need is
water pump as well oh you know I'm gonna
do one pump every time I see that
something happens and I need more than
one
oh I just love it and then I'm using
it's math 105 brush obviously obviously
obviously although we've been oh wow I
believe just put my eyebrows you never

we bought the $15 be proud of water it

water in a Karen but everybody what
lives for it
what can make region Hey well Janey you
know I was thinking probably how they go
to the box and to like neutrals where I
actually got private problems Craig
crazy for me and it's Kat Von D shade my
palette which I think you'll find as you
chose I need to do further investigation
here for the research so I asked you
patrons of Chinese Channel have you ever
experienced like first redness first
symptom redness along the lash line
second symptom couple days later
flakiness and dry skin like peeling
flakiness and genuine sword from the
calves on D trooper liner the tattoo one
how your experiences I need to know it's
pertinent that's has happened to me and
so I'm trying to like track down if it's
that or if it's something else or if
it's like to accommodation of things I
don't know
yeah I thought I told you guys about
this year actually when I got my life to
my botox and I actually got filler I'd
say to my nose so my friend using the
longer sets in these lines just seeing I
didn't want to boast about it and
telling you at work and it does work
because my friend Asian wife's an unholy
amount of time and I'm going to use this
late one underneath my eyes six who are
you doing I'm putting on my face true
poop no it's I think that I was just
what ASCII of you did you know is it a
girl taking a little oh I smell it turn
you into yeah Wow did you inky pinky
part I'm gonna go for a really glowy
sunny cast Luke today could be dog okay
what the fellow blendin want sex
and so from my Scottish family out there
I highly recommend that you take a
little trip to the beautiful Bank of
Canada it's a really beautiful place
everyone thinks I'm going to move here I
kind of work with to actually take me
and ask me if I am coming home Marc
Jacobs spotlight glowstick I apply this
in several different ways it one of
which is straight from stick Pat hang
because otherwise it'll move your
foundation around yeah just looks
amazing already and then I like to bring
it up my tent poles just like so and
then what you can do is I like to go in
with my foundation brush and a little
fat product and then I'll just use
painting rebuffing movements not too
much because obviously you want
foundation to move okay I play the Marc
Jacobs falling on and is looking for a
Chloe but we're not finished no sir
we're going to put Baker or pull on top
and this is the ultimate combo of life
every time I get my eyebrow I'm just
like maybe I shouldn't do me come
anymore no way you're so nice that guy's
perfect know what I do with the dogs no
I'm a strong boy what would you say the
biggest difference between Canada and
Scotland is and whether the scenery
well Scottish sceneries play as well
it's not differently well let's see if
it was the sunniest karagöz Obie stores
nice move the people are nice as well as
Canada okay what's your biggest
difference between America and Scotland
now you're opening a can of worms I say
this on periscope yesterday I went to
maitika on the information that it was
going to be like home alone takes and
say friends things like that not like
that
guys I told it's really cool and early
Vegas in New York were all generally
cool but movies and TV shows kind of set
you up for a feel and that's why I'll
say and I said that's because they're
all actually filmed in Canada well no no
no but a lot of them are a lot of more
like set in a certain area but they're
actually filmed in Canada in fact
although it didn't help they read it
history it rained and VJs which never
happens every New York le was probably
the nicest and it wasn't even that home
yeah
where's my brothers like oh so trash you
compare like raising me yes no Jeannie
um okay I'm going to use the cream and
powder eye color from Tom Ford and naked
bronze I feel like I should tell
everyone how much it cost because she
made me buy it - it was $69 I believe
Canadian before tax so you put on like
this cream product first it looks like
you put on the little green product
first and then you put on the powder top
but the powder isn't
like the dosa cause one is oh dammit I
accidentally did the thing that chick
asked me to do that I was so mad about
well I bought the Tom Ford ones I'm
comparing it to the DOS colors but
anyways it's not as like that it's not
loose powder on the top it's like a
pressed kind of powder on swab um so I
think it'd be a little bit easier to
work with than the just cause one but
we're about to find out right now so
pretty let's see oh that's fantastic
see I told you that you would have
exactly that reaction and you'd be sad
you didn't buy it
punching it I've got a spoolie actually
I fooling you call this pillow here yep
more mascara one I guess I call it's
believed because you're in a beauty guru
nice - my god
you got your so quick I'm just going to
do my makeup and if you really want me
to do a tutorial with this oh well I'm
not going to explain what I'm doing do
you have a Mac to tip over let's see no
I do not I saw it I don't have mini Mac
brushes need a dry I put two two two
four and one a week with them Mike my
brushes and swings always see Justin
Bieber yeah yeah bitch I'm smoothing it
was actually good I like I couldn't help
but think that he was going to he were
going to mean I want to say felt in my
heart I said I was excited if he asked
me to go backstage I'm gonna go
backstage
she did say that I said that I think
I've really believed it my heart but I'm
happy
okay now do your best American accent
connealy American I can do some X and
when she talks Tyrone what I'm really
good at her and you know what I don't
well I don't think I agree because I am
cool goofy dog you're gonna be here
still goofy that's what she says
she goes you're stinker year-old that's
amazing
don't diet you just gorge no oh that's
why I just that's my voice my night what
juice yes which happened this is
something that I learned about Janey um
she is very very intensely
and sudden onset needy of juice every
now and again but it's not like you know
should go home
thirsty and then like a little bit later
being like how I really want some to
like something to drink
it's like immediately she's like I want
shoes and then we need to go to juice
immediately right then it's not like oh
I want juice so like let's go after
we're done here it's like let's leave
where we are right now go find any place
that sells a beverage and then go get
juice this fire is character flaw cool I
am fine with that
I just get really thirsty and then I get
dehydrated and then I get panicked so
I'm like I mean just right now and
that's it I did a video of log actually
if you've not seen it there over me
getting my lips my botox done if you're
interested to see it and I quit a lot
you'll know already that I've had my
breast augmentation which I'm going to
drive a dual one as well because I'm all
healed now and I've been living the big
life for about two months now I'm going
to do a video on it as well I need some
is making juice your Boise no yes to
anything that you're not feeling good
about you can change and I don't want
anyone to think it's about it today if
you feel like you want to get something
to cause a vanity because it's what
pretty much nothing to do is about you
if you look good you feel good then
that's great but even the game yeah well
I just don't see the difference between
like especially I comes to things like
ellipse it's like you over line your
lips to make it look like you have
floats anyways how is it any different
just go and get it done I think you know
I don't know it's just I just think it's
weird that people get cranky well
like that because it's just it's first
of all temporary
second of all who cares I just think
it's funny just when you get so cranky
but something that doesn't involve them
yes it does not concern them in
slightest if I could we could say that
about many things
you sure kids on yeah let people live
there's a phrase that I like mm-hmm
living lately baby when I try to
American slash valley girl accent partly
on that kylie jenner horrifying what was
hey guys so this is my new lip cat
I might say I put a lot of effort and
then I know that I made them myself but
I actually do really love them this year
is just about realizing realizing things
and just being Kylie Jenner
I love these lashes dude I just wish I
could freakin use them more maybe a few
pictures kind of I know it's cuz they're
like really like thin and sensitive so
like when you pull them off they look
great they kinda just almost look like
you're pretty lashes they're so thin and
like nice are they Toto truxedo another
like 20 bucks
Oh for one year oh your man oh oh my god
I can't believe it so soon before we
leave and I'm not anything more than
that come on our week I know I could
another week would be like the perfect
amount of time at least I'd be ready to
go then Jamie belongs in Canada Scotland
okay that's just the situation there's
not much Scotch right here is that of
the label Campbell fight yeah
really much really much very much well
look at that how different is my makeup
today okay Marc Jacobs our bait let's
see the different which ones what colors
do it sorry chase our honey thing oh
sorry
yeah what's choice I don't even need you
to answer my question I know that I
would try this one yeah I think it's
great funny me if he doesn't know me
sometimes matching fatals we don't
usually raise unless a time just on that
side that isn't weird then I don't know
what is if that isn't like just a
calling to for us to be or as message
from other state mm-hmm oh my god ah
that looks it is so nice on my like a
few lovely I'm going to put me but later
on they were really nice formula mmm-hmm
you should use this actually how you put
on your blush ready no this is one saw
the original formula for you how do you
still have it because I just use it
very sparingly no way oh my god hmm I
hear blush I'm done I think you're the
only person who's quicker and make it
than I am but that said if I actually
like really gear down focus and did it I
think I may be faster I think I'm not
actually that quick I think I've just
changed I would quick when I had to make
my mole routine which was like rose
first kid 20 minutes
I take ages clean up my eyes name to the
skin I would quit cricket doing all that
so now that I've got my routine is
quicker I'm jammed I love these things
do you I really do
I look nice on you are these little
Lancome juicy shakers
I really like them they're similar to
the YSL Tintin oils but she looking my
feet I think this would end up not being
as messy because sometimes be Tintin
oils it the oil that comes with a
packaging I like the module for these
and I just done nice they're like very
like the nice light wash of color you
make up something you come to one lips
thank you Jeannie I even you've loved
eating that's why we're finished and I
think that we always look more similar
we've done are made from yeah that's
true I don't think we look similar at
all when you don't want to break your
jaw but I think that after our meeting
suddenly it was I'm always like oh we
kind of like matching mm-hmm and a we I
just don't know what to do it from here
I don't quite feel like and so that's a
trendy we did our here beforehand as you
can see because we can't do here we can
manage but I hide it in private but it's
not the kind of thing that we feel like
we can sit down and teach so what I'm
going to do that yet yet and thank you
so much for popping in I'll have more
videos for you soon know that I have a
new camera and yeah I'll see you next
time yeah thank fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
