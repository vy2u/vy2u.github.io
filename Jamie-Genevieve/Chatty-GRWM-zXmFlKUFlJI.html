you like to get ready let me see please
stay tuned and I hope you enjoy seeing
it all and HT we're gonna work oh my god
by the works
listen for dogs thank you ready bud
nice Iranian here's your phantom and
stunning and gorgeous don't stinkin I
got a new button add a new land
I don't know light and a backdrop it
let's just make up real straight good
start so I'm going to use my Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation which I have
been really liking actually I go I wear
to go and then I just doesn't reach for
it for a long time so I've just been
applying it haphazardly with my fingers
and then I'll blend over the beauty
blender saw you guys how are you how are
you it's been a little while in a hot
minute hot sick I've not been here for
the longest of times I've been on the
goal I fear a fear of it recently yeah
I'm just really excited because this is
my first time with China my new my new
say out and I basically what's done is
I've moved my makeup area completely out
of em as it's in my living room it just
there I've moved eight there and I have
like behind the camera as my kitchen but
I've got a really weirdly bed kitchen
and I don't really cook that much so we
never use the space and we had to get
rid of the kitchen table which we know
about sad because I do like eating food
at the kitchen table so I don't know if
you remember but I broke my camera lanes
the longest time ago I just replaced
that lens like two days ago and I came
home to a parcel and it had my lights in
it but you're too soft lights now I used
to have meringue late but block meringue
late as well and I've got two soft boxes
either say to the camera and then I
bought a backdrop but only this is a
blind kit this is drop this is drop this
blanket actually it's quite mad it's
just like a backdrop
holder stick a big metal stand and you
just clip your your backdrop onto it and
so I got that as well and I got enough
proper type quad for my hammer so it
doesn't fall and break because that's
why I happen last thing this is a test
this is a trial run I'm going to see how
that's set up is if you have any
constructive criticism please do tell me
and if you've got everything it's good
eat please please please tell me but
yeah we're just gonna make up today I'm
going I hope you're doing your makeups
this is a gay baby with me which means
that your main to the kitchen veggie as
well so basically I came home and I
don't know if you guys ever get this but
when I've been traveling and I've been
stealin hotels or like Sam's fliers
really nice and like minimize so I came
home and obviously through everything so
everything I put everything in the bin
everything in the trash I started moving
stuff around because we're hopefully
gonna be getting this flight than up
really soon so the last possession is
the bear so I've just been throwing
everything at me yeah I really like this
foundation actually I don't know why
I've been at first but to be fair I
don't put all the Beauty Blender I don't
know what efforts the usual for this
foundation but it's been treating me
nicely another thing that I do know you
may have seen this on sales video but
the cat 1g transistor paper when I first
got this I just tried to open it my
favorite so I just get my dog Beauty
Blender and then and I have seen every
single youtuber on earth do this before
and I don't know why than do it but it
makes the world of difference my face
does move with I watched a couple of it
but it was just for a known there is one
that was jenna Marbles and it was there
anything she learned in 30 years and it
was hilarious and it wasn't really just
funny it was actually really it was nice
yeah I watch that and then I was Helen
Anderson she's our youtuber from the UK
and I watched her with your body
confident and I thought it was amazing
I thought it was really great and it be
she basically was just saying I've done
it when you just watch that but she's
basically to see in the only the only
reason she started thinking about
body or feeling cannon negative towards
yourself in a room boy it was because of
other people and social media obviously
and it's just it's just nice it can I
think sometimes that your body doesn't
the funny at all your personality issues
me that you are yourself they just
really picked me up and I was I also
watched American Horror Story obviously
I'm actually gonna spray my face I
bought this new thing in Sephora
it's the cordially beauty Alexei and I
go on it proposed luster like shoes is
it okay and disgusting that visionary
just knowing I've had I really I'm not
very good set with that one for the road
buys me so I just dust away and then I
like to use this just to get Matt look
away nice so I think I'm just gonna do
something pretty easy sorry if you came
here for a in-depth tour deal I'm almost
week which is really nice mmm me and
Jack they're just getting some some
family time in before I leave again so
on Sunday so today's Monday on Sunday
and going I'm just gonna use my ultimate
be pallet don't mind me
the Sunday I'm with the Belfast which is
fun I love Belfast so much I cannot wait
to eat it
I'm really excited to over I'm doing a
master class and I had me over there
which will be fine and then I'm home for
a night I see they're friendly and I get
home I'm home for a night and then the
next day I fly out to Los Angeles to in
Hyatt with Too Faced which I'm so
excited right I've handed out the nice
feeds it feels wrong feel like an ethos
and when you use a really warm shade
from ourselves and actually and my new
favorite thing to do is just to you warm
colors rate a night side mmm nice Oh
lips like I'm doing another boring smoky
eye and I've got less the videos that I
really want to get me but if you guys
have any ideas I would love to hear them
and then obviously Halloween I have to
do
for Halloween this year I've got some
really nice fluttery lashes I'm going to
use today as well I think that would
look just fine I think I'm going to ask
Jack and indeed to me there's loads of
stuff out there so much so I'm going to
wait till I come for manatee when I go
to the cinema with me see what he says
I'll let you know on Twitter
I'd like to know what people's opinions
are on American Horror Story also I'm
not sure okay I need to discard still
very bad mess miss Cara it's the million
volume million lashes L'Oreal work it's
amazing
the only thing I will say about it is
that it's got a plastic brush so when
you poke yourself in the eye actually
it's the sort of thing I wrote right
let's try and get your lashes on
also I have no Neela's on I'm so aware
you don't need to say anything again I'm
done tomorrow the one thing I do live a
bit not happen deals owners hope easier
is tap eyelashes let's take these
eyebrows they are crazy I probably
should have parked them beforehand
I'm obviously elongate them as long as
possible
eyelashes so much better and took two
seconds and then something I've really
been loving is getting my little brush
this is just the smurf brush it's the
two or three teeny teeny tiny little
angle brush and I'm just going to bring
the front of the rose don't quite a lot
like you know I feel like this Dark Lord
Dynamix the art should look higher all
my stuff smells it wash I have to see
you guys you should be pretty exciting
but Christmas at wash this year
everything likes it's so good we ended
up with too much stuff to bring home and
our pieces so in mascots get in shape to
me it's getting meals so as soon as I've
got it in I'm gonna do a little hole of
my favorite things I think let me know
if that's a good idea or not
but if you're really cool so take me but
it doesn't take me that long at all I
think to be honest a quite slapdash
these things and I just find one the
cause I like I'm being so pushy anyway
and fatal looking I was one of the Cure
after it like soo pretty amazing
I just great as for contour I've been
doing it slightly later not for any
other reason done I have been and so I'm
going to use these two here from the
Shayla palette from Tarte mixing
together just a little touch rate at the
bag and then what I like to do is just
get my bronzer with my Smith 1 1 2 brush
the famous 1 1 2 brush and I'm just
gonna go around the tip of my nose
highlight a I'm actually gonna use the
shimmer palette again let's use the
highlight and the Sheila palette I've
been really liking this are actually two
liquor plays are aged really really nice
and it's just so easy if it's all in one
palette and then I've just been using my
finger to go my Cupid's bow
and then once I've done my little 10
miles out of school over that with my
Beauty Blender and just Pat that and now
I don't know what to do in my lips
who needs okay I'm going to use a Tarte
lip paint this is the color good range
so it's quite a dark room do I have a
look limit post character oh okay and
subscribe to send me the Christmas star
so this is all there Atari's i Jay
Leno's there is a really cute set with
their lip paints so it's got eight of
their lip paint and then for blushers
with a lip brush
Wow Christmas primarily I feel bad
because these are all actual presents
like we see in the back to from' so I
feel like I should actually give them
paper which would be a nice thing to do
but in two I'm going to use Nighthawk
liner from urban decay and then we're
going to use grunge lip paint by Tarte
and this is be a real ace it's a good
abyss phone door
okay I just darker than I thought but
we're gonna go with it so just let's
look close stunning but the lip liner is
far too late which is my fault
Wow and because I've already beat my
face I'm watching use any powder to use
more of a spray oh I so you guys that is
me finished and I hope you like this
video I hope that I caught you up
somewhat and I'll see you next thing
crack crack crack crack crack pretend
that my nails are cooking together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
