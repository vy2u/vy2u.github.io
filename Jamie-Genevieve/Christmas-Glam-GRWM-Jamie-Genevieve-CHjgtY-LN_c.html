terrible and so I had to have two
different stages of that so like last

say brush your teeth and don't eat as
many sweets as writer because there's no
good in yeah so I had Rick Cal and then
they put my little fake filling in so I
was doped up on pink colors for what
felt like forever and then the next day
I flew to Belfast to do master classes
so I did three classes in two days which
was uneasy
in the all pretty much sold out and I
made some really cool people and we did
some makeup to go though so that was
amazing I was really cool it's kind of
put me is gonna kinda give me the edge
like I think I wouldn't do that more off
and I love doing like classes and master
class and stuff like that so when I
rides in Belfast and basically on the
plane the protection of the plane it
means my felon like loose and all this
stuff that they put and must tooth to
like grease it almost went down my
throat and a spewed when I go to Belfast
so I was horrible then I went to make
splotches the sound I was doing in and
did some teaching so we did three
classes to first date and then a seat
overnight and then I did one the next
day then I went home and then the next
day I was in my old work I wasn't David

with us flippin here in these sparkly
eyeballs

okay let's prime this skin of main
bet effects class nice great I had to
buy another one because I've even from
Belfast the skinny little airport lady

on my face until it was really stuck he
like glue so basically I was walking
through the airport and I had he was on
it people don't know this I'm like 5
foot 10 with no heels on I'm too tall
people think I'm really small I am NOT
small I am tall I don't particularly
like being really tall I don't think
it's I can see or people that's quite
good but part
that yeah it doesn't really thank my job
at all I think it's a good thing so he
can buy the thing that just get on the
roof
so yeah walking through the airport I
had heels or inch I was about sex with
two at least at least textbook to Peter
Naveen my name's Jimmy and I had twice

phones that I must first all that I
worked there and here I just love skin
beasts and I messed it and it was really
nice on top of this train row so I just
8.5 so yeah on with my story um yeah so
I was walking I wait so you know you get
customs I put only because I was only
traveling with my hand luggage so I put
my little hand luggage same on the real
what to call my flippin clothes off my
jacket my shoes so I was standing
vulnerable going through this stupid
machine but I had to do this I had to be
my arms up and then they scans me and
then I saw my little case get taken to
the nori a look was down the wrong so
Emily offered it okay they've pulled
over for some reason and there was me
talking to my kids I forgot a bit like
Jordan or something up in writing our
family and the we women she must be
having a bad day because she was
miserable miserable women in pools or my
case equals s jerky so I'm like yes is
start pulling all the stuff and then I
realized that I'd left Matt oh of course
such a bad sport my hairline is weak one
of those release or ones and I realized
I'd left my my nephew pushy bomb in
there and I was also sorry I can pop
that and math behind luggage and she
just takes it a mins post chief bomb and
she looks at it and she looks at me like
that she thought I was a man and I was
like dude I'm not man I am a tall strong
powerful woman and don't miss me because
I'd been working my ass off and I need
to go home no I got taken off me
that's that and I just bought new one
and I'm happy again but yet getting
questions of being a drag queen I'm not
wrong being a drag queen obviously their
makeups always fantastic so the anything
I was a bit tough for myself but yeah I
hurt my feelings a little bit
I don't look like a man no no be a black
me but a few things wrong with your
mallet a that female up here
okay I'm wondering here is a little
sweet peas we've Isis a cream cheek
brush from sweet from Sevilla Baba I'm
going to use this to blend my foundation
up towards my eyes maybe I don't know me
this is a lot of Italy smokey let's just
concealer to do in naked skin concealer
I would not have talked about this
introduced before it brought genuinely
changed my life in a big way the way I
got color matches I just went in and I
said can I get the three legged shades
because I knew in my mind that I was
going to use it for highlighting and not
going to it I just know was going to use
it for Haley and so I got got two light
shades in and then forgot to give one to
the salad I for what to put one in my
hair and I hide it my bag and I was like
I'm gonna try this you're obviously no
one told me yes yes everyone does
everyone was talking about it and I was
like a shout it's almost like see too
many people are talking about something
I'll be like yeah I'll come I'll get
enough bedrooms got it getting nice and
bright underneath I George Neace with
this look is see if you wanted a darker
you can do the waterline black and so
okay and if you do want to be as
fabulous as me then you don't need to
put lesser on but whose kids are you
kidding great I'm going to use a little
angle brush and ma oldie but goodie Mac
bronzer and dark tan so just like this
I'm I'm going to use that just to carve
out my cheekbones at first I'm not gonna
using yukine's
I if I was gonna animate a husband or C
on clients always use creams because
it's a client and the painful of service
kind of thing but see myself I feel like
I like to look the best I can without it
having to do is watch ever yeah so I'm
just going to use powders on top of my
foundation but because I'm what set a
foundation
it's not a pure dry so the thing the
foundation always kind of mix with the
Pozos and just use us to warm up my face
and key sports at first so like doing my
chair learn the chick born I feel so I
practice it they're in league YouTube
stuff after just two weeks like see when
I think iterator my YouTube brushed it
was obviously like last month when was
it like a month ago
and season saying I've only missed one
video and I do like weekly videos I
really miss one and then I must turn a
roll doorway guide I given this up I'm
gonna be here until the bitter end
those can't wait until I've got a nice
background so once I met sue Sibley
warmed up I'm going to go in with
another funny thing that was meant for
my drugstore favorites but I just had to
start using because I wanted to stay
away this is the collection contour and
highlight palette highlighters crap but
see this color for contour and again
amazing so I'm going to use like the tip
of my little brush and when you go just
under the contour when I say under I
mean the contour you oh my god this is
amazing I'm going to look so Christmasy
when I go and get my Christmas tree
jungle doing moo-moo-moo I have some the
most trusted person in the world is
right now with Starbucks and get a
Christmas coffee get my Chi get the
light get home one on DVD it's gonna be
amazing
it's gonna be amazing oh my face hurts
from the day oh the worst ever and
highlights her what shall we use alright
okay I got a new according to your wine
in law de gallo right especially funny
because apparently I sold on QVC
I hate QVC I hear QVC especially makeup
stuff I'm like sharp but apparently
that's brand started on QVC rate you've
got a matte side for how you light all
right you've got Shemin a side but
they're both like proper highly urge
like they're both so nice so what I do
is I just get my fan brush and I mix
them together but wait TC this thing and
hot like and use look at AHA so excited
I'm also going to put oil in everywhere
it was quite funny like see in the bail
first classes I was obviously like it
was like a class like youtuber newly
homeless I was doing more makeup
governor pence in touch and obviously on
YouTube a candy they liked the bad bits
like when I think ice the exercise like
that no I usually do I do usually leave
them in in be it the class was really
good and I was doing makeup and relief
and see when you see the way I highlight
in real life people are like what are
you doing I was like this is why I do
this just this is the way this is the
way it happened
you need to just embrace it and enjoy it
like I do so yet people were a bit
nervous when they saw it was a big
little bit that's strong and whenever
when with soft and gentle and talk just
to show you that one guys is really
really nice but is a little bit late so
I cannot go in with a soft and gentle on
top and just to cannot I don't know just
cause ready just cause it's amazing I
feel like going on a Christmas day I
don't know I feel cute see this paper
here this is Mac accentuated great
shaping codes aren't Mac at Sanchi like
accentuate and so you wanna use this
underneath my eyes it changes my life so
I'm going to show you the other side
it's prevailed and we can get it online
so I'll link that for you just to make
sure you know hey I'm going to stamp
that on and give it a little sweep and
all it does is it's got like a slight
brightening powder to it in my flight
showers Rio so I think it reflects light
but it's c4 crease underneath eyes it
makes it like no happen it's amazing so
I just give it a good sweet buff Senate
my foundation and it will steal your all
be see on a day-to-day basis I really
lipstick every day and I love it so much
but I'm gonna do it but expect just
because I can
the eyes are powerful but they're not
too purple if you don't mean and they're
more just dark and then go so again a
let's do this
Christmas after all and my hair is going
to be really really curly I'm gonna take
it down to you know I think I'll be
quite nice okay let's do this
okay put that outline and this red
lipsticks nice but is we but panky from
you I'm going to use a liquid like
estate decisions to be latent rain red
velvet one because the red lips like I
warned I don't have I need to buy it
okay I'm just using little layers to hit
on fourth and there we go still
introduced before it's actually easy we
go that's like ultimate christmas-gram
so I had a quite like that see you is
another plaintiff rice and then putting
the lipstick or and I think it goes on a
lot easier like if you're not too
worried we're getting up your Street
Street Street edge trimming really let's
get these pink roses that will do right
so what Jasmine's done she's parted my
head already so this please been a good
date and we're going to take this out
first so what she does she use a bank
battle-torn I could wish HD am and she
cuddled my hair and I wouldn't really
mess this up and she's gonna show aren't
me rate she cuddled on my hero and they
just put it in pen cuz that's what these
are cold and she just used these be so
I'm just taking this I'm going to keep
my time so I'm just taking these out but
by bet and she said it's gonna be really
springy whoa your rages yeah right and
when it can I gently tease the cuddles
out and then I'm going to use my fingers
to make it bigger so yeah let's just
call this quiz wheel okay uh-huh
I feel like Marilyn Monroe they okay
I've got a special brush this is the
bowel mean expansions brush which Ivan
just uses it really lightly like this to
kind of keys the cuddles out that's why
I'm getting nervous because I think I
was wanting to extensions for oil but
see without short here you could
definitely never do this and I know she
does that put it back right here oh I'm
soaked rested radio you kidding me see I
could never do this by myself Who am I
this is best oh my god that's amazing
can you see that uh-huh she's incredible
so the way she got that was pen cuddles

big thing and then I just left the end
