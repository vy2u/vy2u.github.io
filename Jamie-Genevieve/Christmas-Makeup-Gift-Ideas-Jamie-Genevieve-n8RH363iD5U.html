this ends up being a walrus heads make
up Christmas list that I suggested on
periscope if you don't know I am on
periscope now and I am loving life on it
my parents cook farm are hilarious and
yeah we have any loot I'm pretty much
everything this is an idea that I had
when I started failing school and I kind
of thought you know like people don't
really know what to buy here let's see a
few for example I could get oh and your
boyfriend knows that you like makeup but
he doesn't know what it is that you like
that kind of thing is infuriating so
this is going to be a pretty simple
video of me just seeing products and I
know that you'll love because I love
them so I had the trouble of going to
shop so I've got a few things that I
have had for a long time that I've been
using for a long time that I like that
is going to be in their Christmas list
and I have a few things that I went
shopping for because something that I
wanted last year the whole reason I got
this idea was last year I read the pen
chased em of things I had seen that I
really liked and when it came to
Christmas I was open in my presence and
I was like this is exactly why I once
had how did you know I'm almost like so
you've been chased so this is going to
be like my pen chase board but to you
guys
so there's roughly 12 things here that I
really love obviously if you don't want
to know what I am showing so it's a
surprise for you I recommend that you go
and put your laptop in front of
whoever's buying your Christmas presents
right now you put in front of them place
plate and run away in cause you're yours
oh wow
and in that music stellar surprise and
then if you're just watching this so you
can make sure that I'm recommending good
things then you can just give them a
list of what I think that if you are
boyfriend husband mother sister forever
that you're watching this because
someone's like to put the laptop in
front of you and be like here you go
like this and you can know what you want
for Christmas
if you're one of those people I'm gonna
put it down it really simply for a year
I'm gonna see what the products are
basically and why I think your loved one
would love them and I'm also going to
less absolutely
single thing down below with links to
where you can get it so it's gonna be
like literally the easiest custom shop
of your life so there are a few things
that are good we stock and sellers and
there's a few things that are even more
expensive that we make for like a cannon
a spec phrasing let's jump right in
first thing is ah skincare gift which I
bought myself when I was doing mine
chase turret this is the gift of God is
skin and it's a Charlotte Tilbury say
it's always travel state and then there
you've got your goddess skin clean mask
which I saw keep more ads on it I was
like what I need that obviously you've
got Charlotte's magic cream and you've
got wonder glue and since our focus
beauty flash bounce or these are all
things that are great for keeping your
skin and check it comes in at 29 pounds
I personally got this from Selfridges
you can get it from the Charlotte
Tilbury website and you can also get it
from any Charlotte so buddy Koko so I'm
sure so this is one of those states that
they've advertised for Christmas gifts I
have been using the products already a
little early Christmas present to myself
and the are fab so this is a lovely we
guessed second guess second product I
should see there's another skank here
but it's the Bobbie playing vitamin
enriched face piece so this is I thought
it was a moisturizer one of my clients
told me to get this because it's lecture
to enjoy life I've been using it for
life to these and and it's fantastic
it's such a nice base
it gives yours and that beautiful
luminosity that when it sucks out so
it's super orange it is a vet minute so
you've got tons of Ekman's in there it
feels fantastic and it's really good as
a base for makeup so the best is fab
this is a wee bit more expensive I'm
sure it comes in at 29 39 50 or 57 50 I
got this from Debenhams I'll target
there below as always this is just a
really nice skin care but especially I'm
going on holiday in Germany and I'm
gonna take this with me just keep my
skin and shake so number two is the
Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face of
because I'm flying through this I mean I
number three is another primer for
engine you can make up so these kind of
products are good for everyone
that's why I've picked them they're good
for absolutely everyone and then
what I've got is the Ella mascot
readings vo soar again keeping my theory
theme of winter literally destroying
your skin this product it comes with a
little spoon in and I'm just going to
use my finger here as the most majestic
highlighting frame I saw F so I'd excuse
my broken nail
f your loved one or even if you're just
watching this yourself for your doll by
like any fan of my youtube will be a fan
of this to be honest
look at that vidiians it's just amazing
it makes such a difference so I've been
using this under my makeup for the last
week and beautiful stunning so what we
use is a skin care then the face piece
and then Illamasqua primer just your
skin and super hydrate it is properly
cleansed and it's roughly paint from a
cup so the LMS carried in seal you can
get that from the Illamasqua website or
you can get it from debenhams as well I
mean then a couple products are a little
cute little stocking fellows so first
bang areas it'll go to lashes I always
get like getting a little bit of lash
for Christmas I think these are fab and
it's good its low because Christmas
obviously what's next new year so see if
you are going out for new year or even
if you're at like me and you wear makeup
everyday
these aren't green or first glance I've
got is the M one or one that these are
even more natural they are double
layered so they're super fairy and the
second brush I have is m106
so these are super fill they're
absolutely gorgeous on and the goal with
pretty much any eye makeup
I think but those of the line are really
super smoky eye both of those lashes
aren't fantastic
so they come in at seven pounds fifty
each you can get these straight metal to
our website I've been using ill daughter
for over a year now and they are by far
my favorite eye lashes so there are
fabulous little stocking fellows the
likes products are lipsticks and lip
rellenos so these are staple items in
anyone's makeup bag so whether it's
someone who is will do makeup or just a
little bit
everyone always kind of goes for
lipstick and lip liner so the first
combo I will show you is what I have on
right now it is plum lip liner and mess
up sticks or meth lipstick is probably
one of the later notes from Mac it is
satin finish but it does last a long
time on the skin and then the lipliner
I've got with that is plum so this is a
bit darker but see for that on buddy
length is unbelievable this is a new
favor main especially with my new purple
here these like for nose and lips folks
are donating so the lipsticks come in at
1550 Aetna lip liners I'm sure at 12:58
or 14 I kind of membrane the next left
core I have is morning coffee let play
now and yeahshe lipstick so I'll put
that next to my hand
yeah schlep stick is a lot more on the
yellow we say that's a little bit deeper
and it is matte so matte lipsticks are
probably my all-time favorite and the
lip liner I don't oh I got it the lip
liner as morning coffee which again is a
little touch darker but it is such a
beautiful mousse so we've got your kind
of pinky plummy nudes at the top and
then you've got your brownie nude with
Yash snakes product as Santa's lip scrub
by lash back one of the one or a skin
thin when are rich your lips you can get
a chart they get it sore and if you like
written looks like you're gonna need to
fix that so what I've been using it is
Santa's web scrub this is 100% a the
bone so it's made of sugar and it's
slightly coca-cola tip and it's saw as
this it's delicious try and just use it
what it's for us what you do is you
basically get a little bit of this scrub
it on your lips and then anything that
it's getting things like that comes
clean up off and then you can let the
sugar off and it tastes fantastic forget
your lips nice and full and smooth and
flick free this is a must this is only 5
pounds 50 and it's from lush and yeah if
you know me I love lush so obviously
there's gonna be a little bit of lush in
there the next one is a biggie this is a
biggie and the reason I've gotta end
this video is because it is super
popular among my followers subscribers
all that just so basically this is
makeup geek and these are the eyeshadows
that I have practice of what you do is
you buy these individually in these cost
roughly and feral imp owns the match
cost five pounds and the foil cheats
which I don't have any in here costs
$7.99 I think but these are honestly the
best eyeshadows out there right now and
I love this palette that I've made this
has been featured before and my
favorites video for October or September
I'm trying to think these are my
all-time favorite shadows mostly though
exactly for example the look I've got
today I could use clear in this this is
just like my go-to palette I love it so
much so I'm going to last down below
every single shades in here and I'm
going to do my top five of these which
means that you don't need to buy them
all because obviously this palette costs
a lot of money and if you're wanting to
get your loved one a beg beg players in
this they would probably die if you've
gotten this they would probably die I've
had a lot of people messaging me on
Twitter and send Sheeran pictures of
their palettes that they've made that
are just like that's because the winners
of the same thing or the Summum about
what the exact same eyeshadows for just
pull yourself up but I'll give you my
top 5 this sex may be top sex I'll give
you my 12 sex shades that I go to all
the time that I've run out of all the
time so we'll do that but this is a big
place and and I honestly if you're like
proposing this year to your girlfriend
or then you should probably get and this
is butternut up a little bit another big
place and I've got here another product
is there is a we've our rose gold and
brushes so there are a lot here this is
the full range of the volume to rose
gold these brushes I've been using these
brushes for over a year now and they are
by far my favorite I find that they are
really cost effective but the quality is
just insane so these are like my
favorite favorite favorite brushes and
this is the full set of the new range
what what you can do is you can go and
be sleepy but just where I recommend get
them from and you can buy them
individually as well so see you just
want to get your Paris on your loved one
and I brushes you can get a nice a or
you can get them
say or what there's a link times a
weaver's profile and it means that you
can go and have a look at the role but
there are a few in here that are like
totes totes feeds so first one as the
lux face-full case this if you've Harrod
I know we're talking about highly and
this is the brush you need see for
highlight and this brush is absolutely
insane so it is the one one for luxe
face focus brush the next brush is the
luxe face pain that's brush is crazy
I've never seen it before it's got a
really really stumpy low-end but see it
for its Teplin foundation or your cream
coins all right absolutely unreal or
even parlor concert you can get away
with using like without pressure on
these brushes which is five so that's
brush as the locks face paint brush the
one or nine if you're wanting to get
your left on some brushes highly
recommended or school time for sure for
sure last but not least is the alien
perfume this is their essence absolute
so this is the strongest of the alien
stains to be honest I think all of the
alien scents are absolutely stunning
especially the classic purple bottle
I have always loved these perfumes but
lately I've been going to this I'll use
hardly any of it that is because you
only need like one spring wine spray and
your you'll be staying over all day if
you're looking to get someone some
perfume for cosmetics or if you're
looking for it for yourself definitely
gets us a little smile next time but you
are in the fragrance hole or you see it
okay guys I hope you liked this video
very short and snappy but this is
actually my favorite Christmas stuff I
am looking at it all right now and if I
go give that for Christmas I would be
delighted if I didn't have it I've
already got it don't get me at Jack
please Donna these things are just
things that I person I think a really
beautiful and I would really like to
receive as a gift if this is just
something you're watching for yourself
these are my November favorites and I
hope you all enjoy your Christmas
shopping and I will see you next week
