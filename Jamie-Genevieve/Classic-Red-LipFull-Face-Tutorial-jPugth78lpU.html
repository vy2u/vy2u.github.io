be the label up so what you do is you
can connect your little leaves

leaves and then it kills us logs so the
ma game is to get a certain amount of
these colors or Saturn avoid of slugs

I put a like down below for you to go
and download it and then we can job I
can our best fiends ie group and about a
week's time for your all and my state
okay let's just make up so basically
what's happening right now is Julianne
Moore and I'm a bull crap and I'm
working all day in a silo and I've only
got a couple weeks left so I'm at work
in nine till five what a pretty standard
day actually which is nice and straight
after that me and a couple of friends
are going to go up and see Beyonce so I
am so excited
but basically what I need to happen
right here and then I already got to see
on all day only it to be nice all day so
what I've done is I've used my Bobby
Brown face base which I know works and I
have been used in less primer for a
while now and it's amazing it's the
hangover x2 feast Kramer and it smells
like coconut and it's really nice and
it's a really complete texture and put
that on top of my Bobby brain and it's
just saw mmm like see right now with my
my vitamin enriched foods and that's all
at my face smells a quart deal but
because my we have a pillar I'm just
going to use the big car with a tiny bit
of the luminous seltzer usually I've got
one pump they're cut to problem yourself
see apps widget it around so using my
Smith one run five or viously we're
gonna stuff without on all over good
thing about this tutorial is this touch
the quick I usually get ready sometimes
I get myself home was too much pain to
the cord so I end up just sayin and
taking ages videos 2d I did what any
normal person would do and I snooze for
45 minutes so yeah I thought this was
going to be a really good Levi be able
to do it just showing you guys exactly
how I get it in the mornings considering
some things like mess out states and
exactly for example I'm doing a
foundation first it you were to started
doing anyway but just in case I don't
think I've done that many videos of me
doing a foundation first so that's
pretty cool
and then when best fiends wanna touch
and one to ten sponsor the video I was
like yes under eyes so I've been using
as concealer if I can find that yes
don't be using this concealer for Santa
gotta everyday sent Agathe
it's called tar sheet tape a the best I
don't know ah someone's gonna ask me
have a feel about it compared to creamy
concealer and I probably like a bath
fire every morning look how the co huge
the tubers is a huge troop I think it's
like double the size of the creamy
concealer and I like to put reckon
sealer everywhere so and it's got a huge
by top to see the week you can see those
really tiny little appliqu here the
sheet tapes like chunky so it covers
tons of space and you'll just see I just
love that I think it's amazing I think
it was really nicely and I'm going to
show you how I say tonight shaken and
then that we routine I've done every day
since I've quartet has really made a
difference well how do we do monitors to
make sure perfect day okay really happy
with that coverage and yeah I just love
the product
she keeps done something special to my
face okay we're going to put on the the
laura mercier secret brightening powder
and I get
I fear we better on my brush and I just
still not decided what to do with my oh
yeah okay
and I was genuinely worried a pro dirt
Adam went just underneath my eyes but
you see how great and smooth and make
them it also makes my eyes look really
small for with nothing on them so let's
fix that and when you go in with alien
little pin pop as always guys I know
that I'm firing through this really
quickly but this is real time and I got
work if it worked hit em lean more
people as always and as always of course
I'll list everything down below maybe
the brush our pilot is really stupid
it's a baguette is a weaver what's
called the fleas pain vegan brush but I
just love it for the planet because it
does in about five seconds and tail is
of the essence
okay and then I'm a big beard or I'm
going to go back to my skin and I've got
my favorite ever product Marc Jacobs
gooseneck I think honestly I think this
is one of my favorite photos that's come
out this year and I'm doing my bit cut
off all my life my love my everything
and that's what you are all in for and
as for me doing the feel phase highly or
challenge I'm not sure if you really
really really want me to do it then I
will
and again and I for you guys underneath
this video telling me to do it then I
will
okay never bit applause my skirt up and
I've just been using my dark tan from
Mac my man utilized scan finish my MSA
and it's so nice or bronzer up I know
what I'm gonna do today I want to do
pretty much the same makeup I did
yesterday by then take a picture but
it's sort nice it's a really quite
different from usual
but considering I did it yesterday it
can be called able to look because I've
done it to do at all and it's quick it's
quicker than a big old smoky eye super
bra okay better blush so we're going to
use a tight one I love this it's called
sensual I use it a vide of life I'm not
a huge fan of uh shows but when I find
one it's so natural and it's just really
lovely so when it comes out when I find
one that a lake alta sees every day at
what you can do now I'm I'm going to do
this in a way Chanel Lisp a leader in
translucent
- and I've used this for a quick well I
really do like it a what I like to do
with it is get someone running brush I
liked it buff my contour slightly with
it and it paid her is the skill
underneath it was not because I'm still
using my brush but it's a similar so
much thing hey I like my country to this
shortly to do so if I'm offending anyone
I'm not sorry
okay let's do price so I'm going to use
my Anastasia beloved number seven mini
sable brush brush through my brows get
rid of any excess product cause
obviously I do my my face first now I
get reduced of my gross so I just brush
through them that's get rid of the that
gets rid of the most part and then we're
going to go in with a dark brown deck
blow seemed altered seem old and I'm
just going to comb out my brows
I think over I mean just pencil a minute
if you guys want me to do an updated
tutorial on how to do Fresno and because
it's changed again obviously I do my
skin fresh though and let me know to be
through the techniques pretty similar
but different order and all that suppose
it even more natural maybe I am yeah I
custom only 10 minutes off my makeup
time by not carbonate so it makes a huge
difference
okay I'm happy with them I'm old membra
closure dentro so it doesn't go out and
they're a beautiful and my bro bail bail
mask
I still go between gimme brow and Robel
to be honest but their stuffs it real
nice it's Ella maskers new bro chill and
it's got three fibers on it
so it kind of builds it off as well
which is nice considering I've got even
more actually Pablo's this can I get to
be a bit more depth and then always just
kind of brush the front straight up my
eyebrows are so dark naturally that I
find it quite difficult to get a an
ordinary blow so I thought about
bleaching them but then I remembered the
time I shave the ends off and that
wasn't very good
I'm gonna win with an eyeshadow brush
I'm going to use this color here it's
just beaches and clean by makeup geek
it's the nicest transition shade I would
say and I'm just going to use that all
over my lid just to sit the lien little
pimp port and then I would easily but
underneath my belt just to say that
because I don't get Rea up underneath
the lash line with my little area bottom
Mercier powder and now I'm going to oil
it with my burger semester brush which
is the 232 and we're going to go in with
the shade from makeup geek fluffy and
I'm just going to create a leave at a
definition of Micra fees nothing crazy
I'm going to leave it pretty natural
today my eyes I mean my skin I'm fully
aware I've got a lot foundational
now we're going to use coffee to wake
ourselves up
we're going to use Kat Von D tripper
obviously baseliner
a broom and I'm just going to use that
yep I'm going to do it tiny little
flicks different but it'll be nicer
promise
and you see how that just totally
elongates my and gets ready for its and
lashes okay so I need to meet this one
the same as this one curly this one

meet yesterday so I've got a really
lovely me package from hoster lashes and
and the lashes I'm using are a little
tiny and get the straight temptress
