tutorial so I'm gonna do a creepy doll
look for you and I'm going to start off
after my base I've done my foundation my
contour my brows and planed my lights
I'm gonna go in with stealth eyeshadow
by Illamasqua and I'm gonna pop that all
over my lid I'm gonna go under the brows
as a highlight everyone that my
Illamasqua shadow and dizzy I'm gonna
pop that all over my hair I and my
creases whip then eyeshadow forgiveness
by Illamasqua and I'm gonna pop that
just over the eyeshadow just to give it
a bit of a bit so it's like a darker
from color but down that's my blending
brush by Illamasqua and I'm going to
just blend that out making it nice and
soft
both eyes so just making sure it's
really nice soft blend then I'm gonna
win with my Ella Massacre pencil in
elite which is a great fright going in
my waterline making it as quite as
possible and I'm dragging it under the
eye as well you can extend this as much
as you like I just chose to do it a
little bit then we're going with my gel
liner by Illamasqua
and I'm gonna draw in my made-up
waterline under my eye and this is
what's gonna make your eyes look bigger
it can a creepy doll weave and black eye
shadow but guys upsetting by Illamasqua
and will buff out that Lane a little bit
smoking it out under my eye and when I
go in with dizzy eye shadow and just
blend that out a little bit more just to
kind of match the top and making sure my
eyes are nice and round as well back in
with the gel liner and I'm gonna do it
math flips so they're not as big as my
usual look but because the doll it was
what came around it eyes that's what I'm
sticking to so just doing nice flex on
both sides
the steel liners five for this cause
it's also black
back in with my obsidian eyeshadow I'm
gonna darken up for my crease a little
bit just using my eyeshadow brush and
blending it out with my blending brush
again we're just making it a little bit
darker going on with my lessons which is
the lush lash by Illamasqua perfect for
Halloween but I wear these every day
anyway so applying them on both sides
obviously then I'm gonna go in with my
bottom lashes leave our ela mask as well
cannot remember the number of outfit on
underneath propping them underneath my
makeup water laid and this is what
really makes it look realistic
and with my beguile pigment which is
like a really sparkly white pigment and
popping that in my NRI and with a big
fluffy brush I'm popping it all over
math dates letter everywhere that is a
really good highlight in pregnant as
well you can also mix that with your
foundation if you want it's an all
little qu n with my liquid liner our
best this is cold and I'm going to draw
on my freckles for puffing on a little
spread of vehicles all over my nose and
cheeks and with my fav lipstick T's by
Illamasqua and this is a perfect nude
clapping that on all over and then
laning with corner pencil which is a
really dark brown but it's perfect if
you want an ombre lip so I'm over adorn
my lips quite a bit because I want big
juicy lips
well equip more tears just to get nice
three-dimensional beautiful lips doing
my healing little cute pleats you can do
a bauble if you want and that's my look
easy Halloween look hope you liked it
and I'll be back next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
