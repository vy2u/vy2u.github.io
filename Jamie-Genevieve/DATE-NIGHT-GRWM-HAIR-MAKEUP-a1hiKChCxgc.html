well because obtainable a little bit
there or doing my hair so i saw her
throw that and for you guys first things
first always i'm going on a date
but that makeup is suitable for any said
a lawyer you guys will think that makeup
a little bit too grungy for a date it's
a little bit too much i would not be
with jack if he had any connect severe
feelings towards parity my makeup jack a
super support for me and what I did
we've been together for so long know
that even when I went through my ups
phases of doing bright pink up she says
it's getting much that cutie like you
look closely to the exclusion key does
knock your hair to my makeup he thinks I
look good all time but yeah you guys do
your makeup for you to inject for anyone
else
I'll be watching so yeah basically I'm
going to take that picture today and I
wanted to look saw week if you guys
would like to see how I got ready today
please stay tuned
hi okay we're going to get ready again
so you guys are so nice on my life get
ready with me thank you so so much so
this is going to be date night further
major is to pair my skin I'm going to
use the friction perfect primer from
Rimmel if you guys seen my really old
videos you more like this i fab
on a good I really made texture and
masking tape is kind of combination oily
I would say a little bit dry in there
and I've ordered on my skincare so I'm
just popping us on all over giving it a
little bit of time to think and I really
do like that I think it's a nice
consistency and I will meet for that in
a second I'm actually going to go ahead
and
my eyes I think I'm going to use a
modern Renaissance palette and a little
bit from the male stack cuz they're my
favorites at the moment so I'm going to
go in first with raw Sienna from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette I remember now
Sheldon UN yeah I'm gonna do my eyes
first so I'm gonna go in with the raw
Sienna color first and start to build
that leaf and the reason I'm going to do
my eyes first today is because I really
want to do a super super smoky eye
crease in Wales
I'm just building that up in my crease
as usual I've got my eyebrows already
because no one's got time for that I'd
like to be honest building up that rule
of Sienna beautiful transition shade
it's a really gorgeous color it's
perfect it's a perfect warm tone to
blend out like black eyeshadow which is
what we're going to use today pretty
excuse my hair that's going to get sex
layer at moment Jax having a busty
bubble bath I got on my bubble bar from
lush I can hear homogeneous being nice
building up and what we're going to do
is we're going to do the top of our eyes
and eyelashes and relief underneath my
eyes until after my foundation and
concealer because someone commented
saying why don't you do that and I was
watching some other youtubers and they
actually they do that technique so they
wait until this done all their
foundation to do underneath the eyes and
I can totally see why it makes sense it
looks a lot cleaner
I'm retired every such as prior so cell
building up important tip for an orange
a little bit note but he's just here
very similar in color and everybody born
with these shades reveal guard this is
my favorite color in the palette all do
you sleep this is my semester 32 brush
and I'm just going to start building
that up in the crease also and we don't
want to the like just a little tiny bit
cause that's a regret for the black I'm
just going to wing it out all I'm just
going to start dragging these eyeshadows
ah life that's a good thing about these
eyeshadows Azhar so beautifully
pigmented that you kind of start going
to win it out and we're going to excuse
me whoa look at this stuck okay now
we're going to start my art from the
milks mate
Dark Matter sack obviously I'm going to
start packing out onto my lips I'm gonna
actually zucchini because we need more
feet in five to seven we're going to
start like Bob real it's a nice black
eye shadow over everything so liver woo
and I'm finished
happy birthday genic so I'm literally
just selling the kind of lower legs
which Lutz what pen crazy actually the
Uglies makeup I've ever seen but I'll
show you that's going to get better from
here good thing about male shadows
obviously the crate hard to get it for
those in the UK is the worst bet hundred
percent
they're amazing I never one of my
favorite eye shadows of all time I am L
to get them individually now so you
don't need to kind of wait on the stacks
although I do definitely recommend the
dark matter and the rough stacks they
are for real the next eyeshadows have
ever used my toilet I'm going to wind
with my little stressed 230 brush and
I'm going to start blending that black
height with realgar again I'm just going
to go write a mystery recording garceau
war hopefully it's going to help it just
moves a little bit yeah bear and then
one thing that I've I doing this ilex
that I was going to make sure is I wind
up slightly I don't really like a really
rounded black smokey I like to kind of
color it a little bit but when you're
using kind of black eye shadows is a
little I cannot boxing for law by some
forces the warmer shadows to help blend
and then back into the black to get the
right shade and a commitment I should
see that and when bathroom was not I was
not used to associate when I was my my
two to four just to start really buffing
that I and I'm going to go back and it
was the too fair a time when wins a
black I'm going to buff that into my
crease heard your bath Lotus was a nice
I'm going back to miss real guy and then
blending up black I do more so you
really want the black to kind of go over
the crease could see if you just focus
the black on the lower lid it can make
your eyes look pretty small and I would
say that the key to using black
eyeshadow is laicism work because if you
just go in the black bowl over it's
really
the blades out back in the real garden
can someone please recommend a program
for me to finish petty little liars and
I do not know what to do with myself
through a CD who is a bee Spencer
another fake nails but if you've watched
that you know what's alternated Spencer
really and not easy by the way I don't
think French alluring well I definitely
think this is one of the trickier
makeups to do I was to me I'd like to go
like for brushing her hand I'm going to
pack that black onto the lid again and
then I was a better father imagine that
my foundation already and it was all in
there and that would just be super I'm
shaving okay I'm going to start the oh
oh of course should just like so and
imagine all the do my lashes just home
in a week and do my beats I'm losing the
back end oh so now that stop survivors
are done I'm going to go straight in
with my foundation and when you use the
marks perfection through Indian burger
mouth any she'd Soviet and I take three
pumps which seems to be quite a lot but
Alex Lee pumps and when it do this all
of these are luminous foundation pretty
much pretty much every day since at a
little trip I think it's great at last
meet super long it's fine when its mate
cause we're bringing it for dinner I
want it to last ages
I'm just doing my little dot saying
excuse and Neil's they're actually
really really cute they're like a nice
links and it's all more Neil but I'm
going to put Taylor and a week and I
wanted a fresh set of acrylics so I'm
having a break and then when he gets
very sick quarterly okay now that's all
I'm gonna balloon just using my stress
one on two brush when you treat the
hermeneutic and then once I start
playing that I never actually too much
bending show so I think all that you
only need two pumps cool as close to
your library as you can we blend it into
my hairline
and the reason I will over my left is
because I've got such a high color in my
lips that it really puts me off for them
to a makeup
and by high-colored I mean that they're
really pigmented so you can see they're
really rare I think I really like tank
probably it is I do not like pink
lipstick because my lips are so pink
naturally okay fronting sealer I'm going
to use my heart shape tape and leave
shade medium and the reason I'm using
medium let's put them a little bit more
time the news I just don't want it to be
crazy bright just all the usual spot
this is going to add that extra coverage
Queen I need it and it will go super
flawless finish the end of it I'm going
to call my brush over to Urban Decay
diffusing highlighter brush just to get
right under my eye that makes it look
even career zero and see you here
yep super full coverage and far no we're
going to set our makeup so I'm going to
use the match perfection powder by
Rimmel also and this is just and
translucent again if you guys been
watching my snaps my YouTube you know
that I've been really loving this pose
oh it's sort sheep but it just gives
your gun soil so I just lately cannot
put a favorite photo underneath my eyes
my chinny Chinchin
pretty much Romine knowledge as well and
in my forehead and this has been tried
in taste bed and it seems to just
totally set on makeup something move and
get oily but it's still breathable a
tablet cakey all the good things okay
let me back in so now I've got under my
eyes all set all done and we will end
with my Smith 55 brush and I'm going to
use real car underneath my eyes I'm
going to leave all of that and what's
not but you'll see it it all comes
together
gonna go in Wesley she burnt orange and
I'm just going to really Buffalo's edges
and I'm going to bring that on top and
make sure that everything up here is
nice and blended
you can see that just kind of tapers off
okay
just open my eyes up I'm going to use
the thick awake pencil by Taric that's a
a nude pencil is just going to brighten
up my waterline now I'm just going to
use an all set of lashes these ones
I'm sure the unicorn off by lowly lashes
and I'm going to check on my two feet
better than sex mascara while this is
like vintage Jewish you interviews is
excluded allocable off camera and
finished off my mascara and suck on my
lashes I finished in my makeup I'm a
 idiot or what I did was I put on
the lashes and I'm in a little L corner
highlight using my backup or pull
highlighter this one I never been a move
on to the skin because I feel like my
face looks super for I want this and a
pause and look at that oh I have to turn
ur huda beauty palette so I'm going to
use the gold sand wire underneath pink
fan
I think goat sounds for a deeper skin
tone because this other person should be
better company is the 3d highlight
palette by cwe and what we do is we
first go into the cream which is called
Capri I'm going to push that on then I'm
scooped it on already
oh my god that's awesome Rajic oh I'm
happy butter nice and then I'm going to
go in with the shade Santorini and I'm
going to use the cat 1g brush to put on
size beautiful you know I was worried
that I would like the cream part but it
actually really helps hold the products
underneath will if I have Beauty Blender
at the moment I probably would have to
oil abused Lindo that's printable and in
kick once left now we're going to do a
little noise and whenever when she it
was the shared Santorini which is a
poser color and I'm going to go ten
million dollars that's stunning
that's ornate and I'm going to give this
little yell actually playing okay
now we're going to bronze and contour
and I'm just going to use my Mac start
time for those I love it and when he's
must mess one one two
right underneath my chinny Chinchin
to make it just a tune and then
obviously my forehead as well it's on
whatever does make up I feel like a
sassy beer so undress actually camcorder
in the parameter must be more than
anything making sure it's really nicely
blended everything seems to blend until
that foundation really well considering
have not powdered it down really like a
payload underneath my eyes but I've not
powdered my cheeks or anything and when
I get to have canet cheeks I cannot
blame the up sort of a blush and I'm
going to assess what a spot of blusher
on I'm going to use my usual risky bite
art because I wanted a super neutral oh
ok she's meant to be but low down here
and my pet for that and get your powder
brush the brush that you used to apply
the project and then I just cannot blend
it back a little bit okay tonight to
contour my so many Livermore a m41 to
brush and a lot about my dark tan
bronzer and I'm just going to go down
the side of my nose and then skip just
where we meet the probe and then I like
to go underneath just here because it
makes me think I've got other we've got
my button nose press the dream I'll
actually a handful by the corn terminals
but this is virtually all ado I'm gonna
go in with my Kat Von D tattoo liner and
Mad Max blood and just selling a little
freckle
so I'm going to use my Rimmel lasting
phonetic lip pencil and she cappuccino
to line my lips I want to put the color
on I kind of get them out of that slept
a little and that helps blend the canal
lip liner and a little bit and I'm going
to use the milk matrix lipstick initiate
knit which is a super 90 left with a
dark lip liner but you know my babe
right and I'm just going to add a little
touch more contour cuz it's not it now
so when you use my care naquan
sculpting powder in the shade medium I
just won't be my eyes really quickly
with my brow gel
to make sure that everything in please
and they don't have any powder on them
negative on to the here portion of the
tutorial but I'm not very good at you
guys watch my videos you will know I'm
talking about it here but you all wanted
to see me coma here and potentially
brand myself but I'm not going to read
too much into some other quick writing I
have extensions I have one and they are
here jeans and my favorite things in
life my hair and create diary I don't
think that people really watch them here
that much anyway so yeah we would
revisit so I'm going to do some dry
shampoo and I'm just using my tangle
teezer to brush out see if I can play
tricks that I probably yesterday and
then I put like ended up putting it in a
bundle to the picture so it's pretty
like it's currently by a loop a tape of
water the driver has been reuse is red
can pill put board a 3d extender this is
an oil observe absorbing dry shampoo
actually not use this before but I do
like Vidkun and it's not white which I
like woo that's pretty I'm still kind of
getting right here ready I'm going to
turn on my tall
this is the GHD battle palm so it's like
that I bought it and the airport wallet
in duty-free because obviously you get
money off for your buy from gypsy and I
going to absolutely to the goal but
they're going to use it until recently
oh so I'm going to put half of my head
up come on okay
what's that - what last is bottom as
much full length of extensions so now my
hair is down is completely brushed out
and I'm going to be honest the only
reason that I know how to do this is
because I watched desi Perkins tutorials
on Hoshi car over here at like beachy
waves and I copied it so what I do is I
get a little section put the bottle on
move it going and in color
back away from Musti I open the barrel
live it down do the same thing move it
down and then when I get to the end I
just cannot pick it and that's what's
legs and I don't hold it for too long
Gigi is obviously a really good blonde
for here as I get super hot they get the
job done and so brand that I trust a lot
of people use cheaper peer tools the
winnings I bought this one in particular
because my hairdresser uses it Jasmine
from Guang telling you dessert and so it
does the guys at Weber and yeah is
virtually real from me so on the other
side we literally do the same thing but
backward so we get the pure top curl it
back we're researching move it down curl
it back to have its own curl it back and
then likely just pull it at the bottom
and it goes just a really nice weeds
I pretty much as coffee daisies here
tutorial so if you actually want someone
that moving with a little bit more that
what they're doing I highly recommend
going and watching that and you can see
my expansions here
they're super gonna but I'm actually
getting a hair transformation by the
time this video goes up I'll probably
actually have my hair done don't see
that oh yeah I'm completely used to sit
here but I'll learn how to do this and I
let you do it all the time mrs. Hurst
over here now unless I wear it straight
or again at Bullard right but it still
loves doing and then I get all my one
here from the top because it's crazy
spec my one here is really sick so these
I've got sentences for links more than
anything and then again I'm just going
to grab section I'm not to purchase with
my hair like I'm not making sure the
sections are perfect probably not ideal
to do this with too much for words in
your here link I use a heat protector
when I first washed it but since they
don't do the curls Mihir really see time
so that kinda how to dry over here is go
and she totally should wash it before
you fail it like this but I miss all
that comparison I mean once you've done
then the next day you're still usually a
little bit curly so you just need a
little takes to take and use for a
couple of strange cuddles through it
look I'm looking more and more
presentable by mistake and snow at the
top part so like I said I've got a lot
of boards in the top if you look it's
really curly down here and play straight
up here so I just get sections and then
some things that will do is
an extension and just kind of tie and
cuddle my own here and to the extensions
a little bit if you're a hairdresser and
you're watching us I'm school
authorities and then at the front I'm
pretty quite about this so I just get
the carrot curler or the bottle just for
two seconds because that's how you end
up with super dry bets that breathe all
you need and them to move in the right
direction and then since I'm just going
to kind of go around the top and curl
really quickly just so it has the right
shape that looks pretty short Lear's
just c'mon shoot moment here is pretty
short actually and get all the top bits
and as long as you repent up putting
them through the curler just once it
won't look too flat and Street and then
I always mess the back so let's just get
the here at the crown of my head oh this
little guy I'm just going to cut a
little shady bit things looking not bad
I've got a little backcombing brush here
and I was going to get my here at
McCrone brush a little bit and I was
back home right there so it's a little
bit solo and then I'm going to get my
text I'm in here straight from way this
stuff is the bomb is so so good so I
just go my hair a lot of I guess you
hear a really nice texture without being
too glossy it's a really nice matte
texturizing spray and then when my ends
are looking like this I don't get my
tangle teezer and I just kind of brush
out the cuddle a little bit so there's a
little bit more beachy for the wanting
to be too joined together and then all
this have to do is go around and just
get any added little bits a little
cuddle that need it careful because the
season a little bit I don't think I
would get home from stupid and it's
always tunnel and then another thing you
can just check and get a little better
world is fingerprints on that ignore
that I've got the second a little big
common area and you doesn't matter if
you look at my hair from the side and
then execute you've kind of gone in a
little bit too much for the straightener
to add some light back here here I'm
going to use the way here oil love this
so just like a little half pump really
rub it in your hands and then I'm just
going to kind of go through my here go
through my own in so Matt Williams
here's money or smooth them out a little
bit and then all of the members to turn
your hair tool and that is my hair and
makeup done you guys I have no idea what
I'm gonna wear yet but when I do it for
a date with Jack everywhere forever at
world someday is adding extra sassy some
dudes I literally just wear t-shirt and
jeans so I'm not say to do if I want to
include that in this module let me know
down below if you would like me to
include outfits and stuff like that
because I definitely can do that and
future for you guys but apart from that
hope you like the makeup look that's one
of my favorite makeup little used to do
a lot back in the day batting like the
kind of illamasqua disease to just
little smoke all the time it's been a
while since I've done one on my channel
so I hope you liked it and then yeah
this is her so my hair now which is
pretty good for me considering is
alertly not be able to do anything at
all I hope you guys liked this tutorial
and other than that I will see you in
the next one bye

break getting close to done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
