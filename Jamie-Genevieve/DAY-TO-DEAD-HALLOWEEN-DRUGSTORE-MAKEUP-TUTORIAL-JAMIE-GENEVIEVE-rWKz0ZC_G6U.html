I am gonna be showing you how to go from
a beautiful normal Dilek and to this I
have collaborated with Rimmel on a
couple of shoots a couple of looks
exclusively for super drunk so this is
my Halloween one if you guys like to see
how I created this look then please
stitching so people always cannot worn a
transition from day to night this is
gonna be our transition from day to dead
I'm really excited about it actually I
think it I was really cool when I did it
at the photo shoot anyway so I really
hope you guys liked it but basically I'm
gonna show you how it's hard les canaux
natural date natural as natural as I get
they look to a really cool Halloween a
skull look so you don't need to take
your makeup off you don't need to start
again as you just got back in from work
you can work straight from this it's
super easy so I'm gonna show you guys
how to change it up the first thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna change our
eye makeup slightly what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take the exaggerated eyeliner
this is Rimmel a liquid liner and I'm
gonna put some flecks on my eyes move
them you in a little bit
okay so Street we were getting more of a
connect evening you look with Arabic
dramatic flex there's something about
putting makeup on top of makeup that I
just feigned
the base like my favorite makeup I do is
always been I just work on top of what I
had already okay so now we've got the
start of reflects I may go back in and
make them a little bit bigger what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna take the
magnifies jewel pencil this one is back
to black and it's just it's black
basically and we're going to use this
site here which is a little bit metallic
and I'm basically just gonna run this
all over my lids to make it super dark
like it's just crazy how easy it is to
layer these together I can't believe it
when I was doing the full of we're
just going straight on top this side
about how the really nice canal luminous
finish it's got a little kind of flecks
of glitter in the earth but it's really
really pretty
we're gonna use that all over and I'm
just gonna go up to the crease for the
moment we're gonna I'm gonna blend it
out a little bit and we're just going
over the pencil and I'm blending that
into the crease you can see how easy
that was now I'm going to smoke here
underneath by quite a bit
so I'm gonna start with the same sides
and I'm just gonna go under my eye we're
just gonna blend that thun same brush
there are ghosts we're starting to get
somewhere super dramatic already now I'm
going to take these scandalize coal
pencil and this is the shoot like we're
just gonna call inner waterline this is
a waterproof pencil so it lasts
absolutely ages so I'm just gonna go in
my waterline and you can see it does add
a lot of drama and i'm going to
tightline my eyes who gives me the
heebie jeebies this is the Kate Moss
sculpting palette by Rimmel and I'm
going to go in with this shade here and
I'm just gonna blend my crease a little
bit make sure it's nice and matte and
I'm gonna bring that color in my inner
corner a little bit too now I've got
about mascara
already but I'm gonna go in with the
rebel volume colorless mascara this is a
super chunky brush but it gives you tons
of volume which is what I want for
Malcolm to wear falsies of their sleep
but I do want my lashes to be nice and
dramatic so that's just as the volume
that I need and then I'm gonna use tons
of this on my bottom lashes as well
mMmmm
sassy smokes I'm gonna jump into my glam
eyes palette and golden eye and I'm
gonna go in with the black shade first
and I'm just gonna intensify I wanted to
be quite matte and quite black or the
outer corners and then I actually make
wonder Neath my eye was that - just a
bigger corners I'm looking at the
campaign picture and I'm good to go
under my eye with a little bit more
black because it was a bit more dramatic
mmm and then I'm just gonna go in with
the black I'm a fluffy brush and I'm
just gonna blend that into the crease
just a little bit more yeah I like that
I might just make my flex a little bit
bigger
actually I'm gonna go over the whole
liner and after going on with older the
shuttle is just it's a little bit more
intense I'm gonna go in with my other
magnifies do pencil and I'm gonna just
really highlight that inner corner and
you know what I'm gonna do wouldn't
highlight my brave one with this okay I
would say I finished so that was our
eyes it's super smoky I absolutely love
this eye look I want to weight it all
day cuz this is cute
first thing which is woody get rid of
any lip liner that's on my lips already
good that gone and then I'm going to
take this scandal eyes Newt pin so this
is actually for your waterline but I'm
going to use on my lips today so I'm
just gonna blank those eyes and do worry
about it we can freeze they are too late
for your skin to them because it's not
gonna matter because you're not going to
be able to see
anyway we're gonna do this skull nose
now so the way we're going to do that is
I'm going to take the Rimmel Kohl pencil
again that we used in the waterline and
I'm just gonna roughly sketch out a
skull nose my nose really annoys me here
and the product I'm going to use to
actually fill it in and this is tried
and tested and it works so well steamer
liquid lip color and this is the shade
pitch-black so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to use the applicator and
I'm just gonna fill in my nose it helps
that it smells nice
and because this dry stain mat it really
doesn't move I'm gonna bring this part
up a little bit and then what we can do
from here as we can wait for that to dry
think over if another coat that will
work really well and I actually managed
to stay pretty neat tidy there what I'm
gonna do now is I'm actually gonna start
shading my face so I'm gonna take it
kind of Beck eyeshadow brush should you
sister
yeah I'm gonna use my eyeshadow brush
from earlier and I'm gonna go in with
this palette again the golden eye glam
eyes palette
we're gonna actually go straight and
with this metallic and even though it's
shimmering it still does a good job so
we're gonna get that we're gonna start
at the back and we're gonna work our way
forwards and I'm just gonna follow the
natural contour just named mmm
spooky once you've got the star of the
canine great conture for miniatures and
when you go back in with the Kate
contour palette and we're gonna go in
with the contour shade this is initiated
coral gold by the way this palette we're
gonna go in with the contour shade and
I'm gonna use that on top and that's
just gonna help blend everything now I'm
gonna go in with the contour shade by
itself and I'm just going to really
start to contour this this head of mine
and then I'm gonna go back in with that
gray eye shadow
we're gonna contour just like the
temples just in here and see her that it
just gives that great perfect everything
else trust me but it's just kind of
ghoulish isn't it
it is spooky anyway see when you're
using your brush you can actually feel
the whole little part of your skull just
here that makes me sound like I think
I'm stupid
not the whole part in my skull you're a
little Tim pulse okay just like that and
I'm gonna take a tiny little bit of that
gray shade and I'm just gonna go just
turn that part of my nose just contour
that a little bit
basically any way that you contour
usually just do it again but with I kind
of gray are you shadow and then I'm
gonna go take that gray shadow again I'm
gonna go under my lip I'm actually gonna
take my bag
culture and just go right my job
slightly I'm using the bigger brush
because it makes it lace can I
concentrate it but anywhere you can get
those great ones coming through it will
just make it look super creepy and sheep
we're getting somewhere I can see that
my nose is dry but I'm gonna go over it
one more time make it that little bit
more dark now we're going to sketch out
our teeth so the teeth are really really
easy all we're gonna do is we're gonna
do a straight line from here
oh and then two lanes coming down to
kind of mimic a Joel but it's a really
simplified jaw it's not overly
complicated look it doesn't have to be
enemy so we're gonna do two lanes and
the we are actually failing this easiest
is I place my pencil here and just move
my head just like that let's sketch
these legs dude I'm gonna take a look at
my picture always have a kind of
reference picture I just think it makes
a huge difference it makes it much
easier so I'm actually looking at my own
face from the hip photo shoot there's
like one thing gonna cover no match in
your corner and then one coming down to
mimic the jaw shape basically cool I
really don't think I was gonna get that
first time and then another thing I did
was this just to bring that down to meet
the chin so the paint slide is by the
way for that was the scandaleyes
waterproof I've used that for all the
lines so far what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna just start to blame those a
little bit so I'm going to go back in
with my glam eyes palette back in with
that grey shadow and we're going to
shade under here I'm not gonna change my
brush to slightly smaller brush and it
helps a lot because the color is so
creamy before it says you can move it
around and get that really nice blend
cool I'm gonna bring that contour just
down to meet the line
and these can have v-shapes what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the I'm
going to take the sharper end of the
jewel which is black and I'm just gonna
fill in that shape and I'm only gonna do
it at about here and then again we're
gonna go in with the part and we'll go
in with the gray first and we're just
going to start to blend that and then
when you go in with a clean brush and
I'm just going to buff out any edges
would it bring this Lane a little bit
further in with these looks because they
aren't victory as you can do whatever
you like honestly but yes this is just
the basics that I like to follow for
this one look that I think looks pretty
good
a lot of its going to going back and
fixing little bets and things like that
and then if you need to you can use like
a concealer brush just to tidy up
anything I think it's time to do the
teeth now so I'm gonna do is I'm going
to go back in with my ninja pencil go
over and I'll let some more tight I'm
gonna take a little flat brush just like
this this product here I'm gonna go in
with the matte black part but it will
end with my brush and I'm gonna use the
product with a brush to get these
straight lines so I can get my teeth so
let's just start with a side of rice so
I'm basically stamp annulling on and
that way is really easy to get home
safely
your teeth should be so obviously we've
got four teeth we're gonna do the same
thing
and I'm just going along my lips now
so they look crazy at the moment but
we're gonna go back and make them darker
now I'm going to go in with my
exaggerate waterproof liquid liner the
same I use for my Flex and I'm going to
use that to just define the teeth make
them a slight extra bit longer as well
basically make them darker and more kind
of defined so we're starting to get
somewhere with the teeth I'm just gonna
take a little bit extra time with my
little glam eyes palette on my eyeshadow
brush to just make sure that everything
is really nicely playing dates the next
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take the color precise liner and this is
24-hour weird but it's it's white so
basically what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to stamp this on an end between my teeth
or my teeth and it's just gonna make
them pop a little bit more like that
basically looks like a chest now but
something that I learned on the photo
shoot was just to press it on rather
than like trying carlomon it just didn't
work so that just makes the teeth pop a
little bit more something else I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take my scandalize cool
pants again and I'm just going to color
it in my lip line like where my lips
meet and then I'm also just gonna make
it a little bit thicker just adhered I'm
gonna take a little small brush and
let's color it here from the glam eyes
palette and I'm just gonna highlight my
cheeks all the kind of highs points this
is like a little bit gray so it's a
little bit more or there we go
boom just cuz we did doesn't mean we
can't highlight so it just gives it more
but I kind of Edie gray highlight and
I'm going to do the center of my nose to
it and I look at my chin actually and
we'll just go ahead and do the forehead
as well
oh that's cool you can leave it like
this if you want but something I said -
I actually thought was really cool
as I actually overlay my top lip with
black so I'm gonna do that to show you
guys what it looks like and then I'm
gonna slightly contour my nose just a
little bit more and then that's how it's
done
so pretty easy so we're gonna do the
Cupid's bow just like that it's just a
cool little addition I thought let's
concert or nose just a little bit more
it just looked a leave it darker and the
photo shoot so I'm just wanting to want
to match it you know I now what I always
like to do when it's kind of more
intricate Halloweeny Luke says I'm just
gonna sit for a little while and the
matter see if there's any little bits
that need changed I can see here that
I'm gonna take a little bit more black
shadow and just buff this out I don't
want any weird lanes my blending so you
guys that is the finished look another
thing to mention as my nails this as a
dremel nail polish it's part of the
retort water collection and it's called
Rita's black and it is gorgeous super
shiny oil slick black so I thought I
would pay my meals for that cage and you
know spooky spooky I really hope you
guys like this look I was so excited to
be part of this collaboration with
framel especially because my first ever
YouTube video was actually it's called
tutorial which is really really cool can
a little bit our throwback there and
other than that I will see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
