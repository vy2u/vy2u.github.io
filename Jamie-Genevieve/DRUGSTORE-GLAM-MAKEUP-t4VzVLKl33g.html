I am going to show you this entire list
I see you guys acting Oh time for a
drugstore only video and it just so
happens that recently I teamed up with
loyal for their new foundation that
would be infallible total cover I'm sure
that you guys may see a little laughter
of me coming up my tattoos so I'm using
it covered up tattoos but it's also
really beautiful in the second but very
Shores create that's entirely even just
loyal Paris
todos obviously super affordable grams
which is great so if you'd like to see
how I create the slip stitches first
thing I'm going to do is go and repeat
color riche eyeshadow primer that is
super easy to use all you have to is
draw or interior lines obviously because
her pencil type product is important
super smooth to it so you can sketch on
all over the lids and then blend out
west eat but it cannot a shadow that
from you betrayed a shadow brush I'm
just going right under the boughs and
then a corner and then they're not
really down onto the face the reason
we're doing our eyes for is s take a
look at the corner edge it's so dark and
it be sort of edge is all the black eye
shadow fill or into your foundation
once that point I'm going to use the
matte shadow and number 107 which is
Matalin Antonio and I'm using a fluffy
brush just to apply that all over and
what's best is do it and it's just
certain that sticky chain marks or the
shadow doesn't go on to second dark when
you start trying to blend that I for a
warm transition shade I'm actually going
to use the Ghulam ruins and she number
two and we're just going to use this
with a photograph and we're going to
start building our up and decrease the
cause I guess I look a super dark you
need that remains warm 10 dozen shade to
help blend everything seamlessly black
eye shadows would be most difficult
Charlotte of live so let's really
I'm just going back and forth it's a
fluffy brush then you're great at center
corner and then we're going to now I'm
going to start to add that that is the
smoky palette number four by law do
products as well and we will end it with
these two darker shades and the same
brush to start building up that dip in
the crease if you need to even go ahead
with a can a cleaner fluffy brush and
that Bruins oh just to help blend
everything out once you start to get
that a little bit darker I'm going to
swap em to eat
smeb lately smaller brush and I'm going
to go in with the single shadow and
100's which is black and I'm going to
use that get a load of that shadow on
the brush and then the basic type Heidi
struggles and to apply it create quite
hard onto this
the lid but the build up really will
what you do just need to kind of filled
up it's almost like a kind of waxy
texture so once it starts to build up
its super dark pigmented - really good
and then I'm bringing that rate up over
the crease to blend and with those warm
kind of really understand sheets and
then just swap and back to my fluffy
brush and the transition shoes to help
will end up like and butter lettuce
foundation last now I'm going to start
to build up the lower lash line I'm
going to use the infallible guilty on
its wait forever earlier I pencil I went
right along the lash line and I'm going
to drive that slightly underneath as
well these pencils are really pigmented
and creamy - great and now I'm going to
go in with these two colors again and
that's a shadow palette I'm going to
smoke that rule Ashley and then I'm
going to go in a 50 black eyeshadow
again and just filled up that smoke a
little bit more oil
I'm keeping Netflix cupcake grungy I'm
not going to do an inner corner
highlight I do however one nice chunky
lashes so I'm going to use the full a
superstar X favorite mascara this stuff
is Christian even it's not labeled fiber
mascara that can it get in your eyes and
annoy and edit it so it's got a normal
mascara pros so I'm just going to use to
build up my lashes and then you go into
the second sight which is also just like
a mascara but it got fibers mixed with
it so we're not actually putting kind of
dry quality fibers near your eyes which
is always always it ot summarize but you
can get a really nice buildup on your
bottom artists especially I'm all those
with long lashes see speed and I'm just
going to clean up now that I have done
it let's move on to the skin I am fully
aware I look a little bit melted in the
wind
first thing I'm going to doing with a
plate my skin with the infallible
mattifying beef let's get a little bit
for my fenders and I'm just going to
work that in to the center of my face I
don't need too much of this because even
Alaska and oily I do like it kind of
work and weirdly finish the foundation
I'm going to use is the infallible total
cover foundation I absolutely love this
stuff I recently worked on the campaign
been in London the foreo palace so I'm
really excited with it it color I'll use
is a 24 which is golden bees I will warn
you it's a little bit warm for me but
what's the connection sealer technique I
use without foundation obviously this as
a doesn't party this is a same a few lon
I'm going out lips or a heavier than my
usual but you'll see it you'll see all
come together so I'm just using my
Beauty Blender again now you can even
cover to that I'm not going to close
with any guys either keep them
relatively free a product give a little
red North Rudolf over there
once you've gotten a profit of that or
where obviously the Isaac super intense
mode now many go and Westby and farvel
total cover concealer palette less
things far it's probably broken a more
late to medium skin tones but you've got
to appreciate their for complexion and
then equally super color creates the
Ravinder is really good for adding
brightness to the skin and the green is
really good for in a covering business
I'm going to add with the brush and the
latest she's just here and I'm just
going to apply that and all my usual
highlighting areas and then this kind of
check actually really helps with a
foundation to match my skin tone for
jobs who want to Mason bronzy and I'm
just going to keep going back
now obviously I have used my mask on
primer I'm using my concealer so
everything is looking pretty silk
coverage at the moment I'm going to wear
it with the too much highlight that as
the liquid illuminator and the shade
golden glow and I'm going to use that at
all the kind of highlighting points of
my skin tool is my cheekbone a lot of
touchable dubrow's a little better than
can I show it on my face as well
actually I'm just going to use my Beauty
Blender apply that and this just goes
the matte foundation a really beautiful
glue and makes it look a little bit more
like skin it's a really nice way to
really feel coverage transition so just
use a cooler note well that is still
kind of where freshly applied I'm going
to go edit with beeps you might
highlight and this edge the a seagull
theme to a sequel and watch this yes and
then if it contains my finger to apply
that instead soon yes okay I'm going to
grab as it draws it again and I'm
actually been cool under my eyes one
last time with my rocking a flat loss
usually because I want this to be super
grungy I know if you've smoked out a
little bit too much not saying I've done
it bet you feel you've done that a
really good which tavio and would it get
the too much super blendable
co-directors this is city CW golden bees
and when you get that and just tailored
a underneath my eyes and that just pays
everything up much easier and then when
you go back end with the flowers
Ron's Bonzo and with a bronze and
quantum of it and now because the look
is it's strong it's a strong look I'm
going to use a nerd
let black oh this is the lip paint
Locker and see she'd one one that go on
this village it's really lovely it
smells good
and it feels really made some molest so
actually it's going to chuck a little
eater that would buy it fails and then
my spirit can have kept with these
people afford it is just too perfect and
you know and that is the finished look
obviously I've some little pony but
a what am I going to go to look for go
and I asked so that I feel a little
sassy sassy queen I hope you guys liked

cent of you and I'll see you in the next
