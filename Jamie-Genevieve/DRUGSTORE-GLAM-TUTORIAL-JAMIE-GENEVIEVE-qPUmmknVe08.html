I'm going to show you how to do this
entire look using all drugstore products
we did it on the cheap but we do not
look cheap I just thought it would be
really really fun a nice fun easy video
for your girl who is jet-lagged I really
really hope you like it and if you would
like to see how I create this look then
please stay tuned hello
first things first we've had an issue
I'm not gonna go get my nails done and
he followed the flogged you'll know that
there was a snowstorm here while we were
trying to get to Mexico and develop the
biggest adventure ever and visa vie I
have no nails and I have had no nails
and I painted my own nails I know that
all the nail polish is it checked off so
if you are only here for me to click
money at the end just sounds like flesh
there's no one else
okay let's get started drugstore baby
everything's gonna be super affordable
so I've already done on my skincare the
first product everybody use as the
Rimmel fix and perfect makeup primer I
have used this tons of times I really
really like it I think it's one of my
favorite drugstore Primrose actually it
might be just one of my favorite flavors
I'm just gonna use this in all the usual
spots look at my pick bc hands just
gonna rub that in my face
and yes i was in mexico had the best
time ever still smelling tequila okay it
was really really funny but that's why
i've got a little bit my time today so
we'll see how my foundation cause I've
not used this foundation before so I've
not really matched it yeah Oh see so I
developed that and it leaves a really
nice moist can is my sixth sense cleaner
actually it doesn't have any screen in
it though I decided I'm ready these my
skin turns super smooth not too slick
every rubbery and don't like that
feeling foundation I'm going to use this
x1 and visibly liquid foundation and the
shade 6.0 shake whale there's a business
foundation has a really good friend of
mine Charlotte has been the pest that I
need to use this non-stop she says it's
the best I'm just going to use my usual
smith one-one-two brush which needs
cleaned I'm gonna clean my brushes this
week hmm
color looks pretty good but yeah Charlie
says this is the best vacation ever and
it's got some serious hype obviously
because it's affordable which is great
but it's made to peel these home I don't
know if you made to be honest I spent
two British that Max is perfect and I
had some redness on my chin and it's
gone so it's good coverage it's
definitely not to like do we know I've
got loads left in the back of my hand
too and I know that this foundation you
can get it in bits in the UK I'm not
sure about this dates you guys for the
states can let us north down below I'm
pretty sure it's more readily available
over there maybe we should try close
sponge arou I'm gonna go in with this
sponge okay I have my Real Techniques
sponge and I'm gonna try and apply a wee
bit more just to the areas that I feel
like I need a little bit more coverage
now you see it goes on a little bit late
so definitely oxidizes a wee bit not
matter this foundation I'm really
intrigued is to pour other products work
on top of it like this is got a really
unique finish I don't know how to
describe it I think it's quite matte
skin like pigments even a complexion for
a perfect coverage that is almost
invisible yeah actually for concealer
we're gonna use the instant anti-age or
user I by Maybelline anyone who has been
here for oil will not really like this
that says these she's late alright I
think it may be a little bit too late
for me and I was right we're just gonna
work with it and blend it I'm gonna pick
up some one of this definitely because
its belly and I'm gonna prime my lids
with this too Mike's just highly her
face you know
coverage I'm ready okay just blend this
them and see what it leaves ice I really
hope this works eh okay it's okay how
safe you guys it's all gonna look peachy
peachy at the end ah
I was looking so good I really ruined
that this is because I have what you
call a chopper my shoulder because I
can't see that I'm tired because you
guys make fun of me when I say that I'm
time and you'll turn it into a short
game I'm just gonna work with that it
might turn out good it is the foundation
look great in the concealer is great
okay just don't leave me no I'm gonna
make this work you're gonna see you do
I'm gonna win with just one more pump to
the foundation I'm just gonna try and
blame this guy in I am going to hurt
around your eyes this is the next three
stick to sculpt palettes and this is a
little easy a little can I yellow banana
color I'm gonna use that I'm just gonna
set my under eye on my lens it's all
gonna come together and you're all gonna
be I'm gonna add some orange into
my skin now and my brothers are going to
be using as the butter bronzer by
Physicians Formula
I think it's $15 which is leave
expensive but it's definitely drugstore
I checked and you can get it in the UK
as a way of saying I think it's called
eye hair which sounds not like you make
up website but it is and I will take
that they blow this bronzer is well
loved by me I love it so much
wait till you see what it goes to this
foundation it's gonna make my hair spec
last time I had a foundation on it was
the best Mac it was leaps into beauty
and you guys all seem to really like it
when me so maybe this is a good tip for
it I feel like it has a similar
finish different texture going on but it
lands up looking quite similar yeah I
wanted to sweep a little bit about
bronzer underneath my eyes and get rid
of that brightness to the concealer is
great but I need a different shade
unless this is you see you I'm gonna go
back into my
be set to sculpt palette and I'm going
to use this dark shade here and we're
going to just contour the video backs of
our cheap ones and the brush I'm using
just a really nice skinny little contour
brush from Smith I think that contour
always looks a wee bit more realistic
when you use more than one shade if you
just use one shape it looks like this
one color if you use this it's just like
a shadow will you use a different color
to add a little bit dip and I'm just
gonna use this banana color Oh
for blusher I'm going to use the Milani
baked blush in Luminoso you get a little
brush with it I'm just gonna use the
same as my bronzer brush and tap in
there oh nice I just like to go unto the
apple of the cheeks a little bit but
they mostly kind of here where the
bronze our ends on the cheeks that
foundation feels really mad and I don't
actually have a drugstore spray that I
love to base so I'm gonna use my pure
hydrating spray I needed that so we're
never going to use a matte foundation I
just feel like I need a little bit you
know for highlighter I'm going to use
the Maybelline master chrome highlight
and achieve molten gold and I'm just
gonna use a little to leave a brush for
this this is really good after wearing a
matte foundation to add a love a
highlighter just at the braid one cause
he adds that shame back into your skin
as well as always good I think we need
to do a noise I'm gonna go back in with
my little butter bronzer and my bronzer
brush I'm just gonna contour the sides
of my nose really quick hitting it
roughly I'm no nose artist and that's
just optional is getting lost in your
face and I'm just gonna use a little
clean ish
eyeshadow brush to do the Boop and then
I like to just tap I feel like the
foundation was like the perfect color
and then I just messed up by using that
concealer that was too light so I'm
gonna crush cool it's a bigger brush and
the purple ones aren't we're just gonna
do a little I am going to
quickly off and do my eyebrows and
I'll be right back and we'll do our
eyeballs together okay guys my brows are
on I am going to zoom you in I will do
so the palette I'm going to use today I
have used two days this is the morphe
35o palette is for great i absolutely
something love it i have traveled with
this palette a ton of times no because
it's got everything I need in it and
none of the shadows have smashed it's
all good to feel the baby so let's just
get started the first shader when you
use is just right in this top corner
it's a really nice transition shades and
the look that I'm going to do today is a
little bit more smoke cute on the
underneath portion of my eye and we're
gonna drive back waiting as well it's
kind of like a makeup I did I was in
Mexico and we're just gonna use this
color to really start to blend our
transition shade and we're not going to
go much darker in the top but all this
is like one of the things I did with
Leslie couldn't make it look really cool
I'm just using circular motions in the
crease and then don't be scared to go
right in your inner corner and blend
that up towards the brow because I just
gives a really nice blue notes soft but
smoky of face makes your eyes look
sexier in this palette I definitely
classes drugstore because it's got all
the colors that you would ever need an
eye on is at your side I think it's
brilliant
the internet is absolutely really really
nice and salt &amp;amp; glam really tray and the
next cone woody Boyd miss is this one
here and I'm just going to go in with my
finger and I'm actually just gonna push
that on the lid and I just adds
everything a little bit shy Merrick
nothing too serious as a really nice
pigmented creamy highlight shimmer color
so you can just pop it on we're gonna
leave it like that far underneath the
eye I'm going to use the m500 seven
brush which is best for me here it
really really makes them small and we're
actually going to go a little bit more
as she colored with this one so it's
still a warm my friend but see her
darkness says it's more of a neutral
Brown I would say it's not got those
three severe red tones in it I'm gonna
go in with that and I'm just going to
start blending that during the lower
lash line and you can see that color I
just make sure I sit super
and tens so I'm gonna stop here and do
the late-night no delay that I'm gonna
use is not drugstore but I can tell you
a dupe for this that is drugstore and
it's the exact same I feel like it's
really similar to Kat Von D tripper the
one I'm going to use as the tart
maneater this one's really good and I
think it retails for about 16 pounds
definitely not the worst price I've seen
but the next I'd pick pink later it's
unbelievable it's so good it is really
really black it's got the same kind of
brush tip to it as well definitely get
that one I'll link it down all I need to
go and buy another one because I don't
have it I think if through because it's
finished so I'm gonna go get another one
but just pretend I'm using that because
it is the exact same and it retails for
about lace so we're gonna do a rings
knife I always start by going along the
lash line first and then I like to keep
my eyes open as I draw out the wing and
then I'm going to go from the tail of
the wagon and drag it back I am really
 this up so when it gets like
this I'm just gonna be huge
and make it work I thought weighing is
massive at least it's sharper so I'm
gonna get a little bit my foundation on
II straight brush and we're just gonna
tell you this end up why another thing I
don't have is a good eye pencil Kohl
black eye pencil that is drugstore I'm
looking and I'm looking and I am not
seeing anything I don't feel like this
is super important so I'm just going to
go ahead I'm really sorry if you're
disappointed but this is the Makeup
Forever aqua exhales insult and the
shade black is really really good and it
cannot call our Kajal pencil I don't
know if I'm saying that right cause
y'all pencil should be good I'm just
gonna go end my waterline and I'm gonna
make that black I'm also going to
tightline my eye which I hate doing
and then to smoke oh I would have dried
that pencil in between my little bottom
eyelashes and onto the skin a little bit
to grab a teeny tiny little pencil brush
this is the Mac 219 and I'm going to go
back and with that dark brown and we're
just going to start so much you know
that pin so the eye shadow just fixed
the pin so really well it helps it
smudge it and they were gonna bring that
shadow and we're gonna go right under
this way not the whole way up though
just like half way and this is like my
best tip together yourself and whatever
came out almond eye shaped more like a
cat eye and then when you get my bigger
fluffier brush I use underneath this is
the more see if Cypress of it and I'm
just gonna use that to tackle the
eyeshadow and help pull into a little
bit further I blend it up underneath my
quite a lot but you just can't tell
because it's such a dramatic way I'm
going to take another fluffy brush and
I'm just gonna go and shade that we used
on the crease color was this one I'm
going to go in with one just a bit
darker just here and I'm just gonna
found out that crease a little bit more
because we ended up doing such a big
wing and cause it's so warm and light
compared to underneath it's fine it
doesn't really make too much of a
defense I'm gonna go back in with the
highlight just to highlight the inner
corner and then I like to kind of bring
that highlight up here doesn't get mixed
eyes really open and fresh and clean for
eyelashes I'm gonna use the dull Beauty
lashes and the style Frankie I believe
that these are only sold and total but
they are stunning and of course hanakos
could leave it absolutely love it thank
you have a sale that's named after me
which I'm super flattered by but I'm not
sure it's completely legal should I be
getting some kind of money for that
where's my money so I'm gonna give these
lashes a little trim
we're on them the glue I use as the duo
glue with the green rayon as if the leaf
takes free brush-on glue super
affordable on the best so I'm gonna get
my little why she said you know far it's
Kara I'm gonna use the new necks worth
the hype mascara it's made to be really
good I've not tried it yet but let's get
our goal you know what it's nice it's
definitely not really competing to the
benefit bad cow buying mascara or the
new iconic mascara is absolutely amazing
it's called boom lash it's the best
mascara I've used in ages
Seifer if someone like me that uses love
every day I think I just need a really
good mascara for my bottom lashes and
it's hot ones I don't really care
and this one's good but I feel like I
couldn't go and get my lashes so chunky
and long on the bottom I'm really liking
this eye makeup though okay that mascara
is actually really mean it actually
makes your lashes look Lee or weeding
the West beads everyone you're super
well we're waiting for our last it to
dry I'm just gonna hit my little freckle
on I do not like this product so I'm not
gonna mention what it is but I really
get a new little freckle pain you guys
have recommended words to me which is
very handy and I don't appreciate that
how amazing are they oh my god laws of
their sales are super similar so I'll
tag dopey even below I know you can get
some sales on Dolby website some sales
on false lashes top coat at UK and then
some other Beauty be I'm pretty sure
I'll link that below but these lashes
are really great okay let me write will
do her lips so I'm really really like
maybe this makeups looking actually I
don't think it looks too too similar to
my fills face of slipping expensive
makeup to be honest okay it far let's
I'm going to go back and use one of my
saves that says the Rimmel lip pencil in
cappuccino some really beautiful notes
just watch
those are lying and then I'm going to
use my favorite ever as the maybelline
superstay Matt ink part of the UH nude
collection and this is speciate driver
