we're now in the studio at the moment
but we really we are going drugstore
shopping today
because it's been ages since I did a
drugstore look on my channel and I want
to get excited about again I've got some
stuff at home but I'm gonna go into
super drug and boots and silver bone and
scoop it out and I want to do a super
glam look because natural makeup
drugstore tutorials are really easy
because the phones like a drugstore in
Dacians these days are really good and
stuff so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
try and find make a sec eyeshadow
palette some good lashes maybe some more
glide tire we're gonna blow inside or do
they have a bronzer that I really like
things like that so that's what we're
doing today I'll see you in the shops so
if I get these two mix them together
that looks good
middle pair don't clip yeah yeah my crop
know everyone always likes I'll keep it
fresh but keep it a sure path I said you
need yeah if I say no is Emma can you
and you've not done before good but
Parrish be composure let's bake our
faces full of bacon you'll ever see me
do but I always do that's a go no not
that one in touch
not that one but we could hat man or
color why would you do that
none of them a man it's nice
he'll catch a travel case this is the
one that everyone is talking about it
because cheap train treat our
apprentices just as good so popular so
those four things they sort that's a
bargain
why am I not try this Ben totalizer
we don't have a composer for trains
you're gonna use that one yeah yeah good
that's on the side going again why how
much are they usually roughly one more
than that
keep them easier supermarket sweet
where is it Eileen oh yeah flat get it
I'm gonna if I sit maintains second yeah
it's good
hi guys welcome back to my channel again
I know that we've just been shopping and
we've got a bunch of new makeup I think
and total ass Paris has been quite a lot
but I did buy other stuff at the same
time so my total was about 100 pounds
but that for a fill face a hundred
pounds in the luxury world would
literally buy you like two three things
so it's not bad for the filthy to make
up especially when it looks I see really
similar to my usual makeup but it's up
to you guys watch the video let me know
what you think there was a few hits a
few messes that you will see I really
really hope you liked it so if you'd
like to see her I created this look then
please stay tuned today and first thing
first is primer this is the Rimmel
effects and perfect makeup primer it
smoothes it resurfaces it brightens and
modifies it protects I really like this
framework so I'm just gonna put this on
all over just a little bit we're just
gonna rub that in my pure skin it was
doing so good and then I've been
sabotage
and also this little bruise right here
is from my botox stuff up I'm not gonna
lie which is starting to work for our
foundation i'm gonna be using the
maybelline superstay 24-hour fill
coverage foundation and i have two
shades here warm sun in caramel beige I
actually think that warm Sun might just
be enough but I think of any end of
mixing them maybe right one and a half
pumps we'll see how that goes to apply I
have an adorable little Real Techniques
grunge which comes in a little handy
travel case which it fits in when it's
fully squeegeed out you know when it's
wait when it expands so we're going to
use this type fire for in Dacian today
and it was $6.99 for this in the little
travel case and I actually think this is
great because dirty beauty blenders ruin
the insides of makeup bags and I
actually think that that color is gonna
be perfect
I never apply my foundation with a
sponge anymore
see this is the thing I think that you
get more coverage with a brush I need
all the coverage today man oh because I
know that I like this foundation and I
did not like the way it's going on with
that sponge right okay I'm gonna put
that to the side real quick and I'm
gonna apply the race with the brush
there's some good coverage do you know
what this will be really good for
me when I'm MC tan but she is not that
turn right now I do not know how people
can put their makeup on like pretty you
know what like people already have their
hair done and stuff I can't do it I need
my hair to be like so that foundation I
would say is pretty matte I have the
revolution conceal and define fill
coverage concealer and contour concealer
this went super viral everyone is
comparing it to shape tape I managed to
get C 5 and C 10 I think I'm gonna go
with C 5 first because it looks like a
super high light in color and I actually
have not used this year saved it for you
and four pounds four pounds okay
we're really going through it today I'm
going full glam
Jack's we getting tattooed when it comes
home he's gonna be like who are you
don't know who you are
you look good you though gonna conceal
all my usual spots and I'm gonna use
this as a we highlight or as well so I'm
gonna blame them first and then I'm
gonna use this as an eyeshadow base as
well because that's what I used to do a
shape tape okay that looks excellent Wow
okay it's it's quite quickly so you need
to work quick fast I can I'm struggling
to get rid of the lanes oh I almost
don't want to put it on my eyelid that's
when I start looking really crazy you
know
okay that is a fill coverage base I love
it I'm gonna use the same color on my
eyelids just a little bit and we're
gonna use this as our eyeshadow base
we're gonna use powder this is the
Maybelline master effect baking and
brightening loose powder there's the
second shade I feel like there's two
shades this is like the peak oh wow
no it's quick yellow I'm not gonna put
it on this sponge because I really just
don't like doing that I don't think I'm
gonna use my brush and I'm gonna really
just put quite a lot on I think that
that works for me better than a sponge I
just use my brush okay that concealer
say it's quickly it does really remain
me over the shape tape you know and I'm
gonna just sweep that away I'm just
gonna get my face a little spray or
something you can use whatever you want
this is not drugstore - I apologize
really mad
scares me it scares the flippin leaf
right at me okay I'm gonna go ahead and
do what I usually do it and finish my
skin off and then we're gonna go into
eyes okay so the highlighter I have here
is another revolution product this is
called the straw highlighter let me see
how much that was three pounds I have
been a luxury lady for too long I'm
going drugstore baby so we're gonna
apply this with my usual brush this is
the shade gold addict but you love me
some gold and I'm just gonna apply this
everywhere it takes a little while to
build it up right that's taking actually
quite a long time to build up maybe if I
weigh it my skin oh I don't know if you
can tell it's got a little bit separated
but fret not I have another this is also
three pounds and this is the brand
obsession from boots and it's like a pan
so you can build up your own palette and
this is the shade parallel h1 or - yeah
so that's kind of filling in the gaps
from the other one no chunky ah right
we're just gonna work with that do you
know what for three pounds they're fine
but I really wouldn't be using these
again they're just really yellow I am
putting these two highlighters to the
side because I'm not happy I dead
forever find my sleek copper plate
highlighting palette that is gonna save
the day
I can tail these sleek ones are much
nicer I'm gonna bronze that now and I
have a new bronzer this is from NYX
because I was looking at bronzers and I
thought that bourgeois verse where the
chocolate Salil bronzed it looks like a
little chocolate bar was 9 pounds or
eight pounds and this is eight pounds
and I think mixes better makeup so this
is the matte bronzer and deep tan and
I'm just gonna warm up my face and I'm
just gonna use this on the side of my
big brush just to slightly
bronze up the nose bring that down my
neck slightly just so we're all matchy
matchy
next is eyes and I'm really
treat a bit this because i swatched it
right I just watched it that's all this
is makeup revolution reloaded neutrals
spelt new like that's new trials to
first thing I'm annoyed at is the
stacker which I actually think was put
on by Superdrug doesn't come off so my
pilot looks may see already but it's
fine because it was also four pounds
from an eyeshadow palette liked with
this many colors in it 15 colors yep so
we're gonna use this today I'm gonna
zoom you in and let's make these as
dramatic but highlight looks okay we've
managed to save it
the first color I'm gonna use is this
metal guy right at the bottom and we're
just gonna blend that enter a crease
there's no matter in this palette and
I'm just gonna blend that color into the
crease I'm just using my usual little
Wendel wiper movements soft circular
movements to start blending that right
it looks a wee bit parity but that may
be me I'm gonna go in with this shade
it's just one step later and we're gonna
use that to try it buff it out for one
color that's kind of crazy like see what
I mean the pigments the decent I just
need to work out the best way to wear
these shadows and work with them it
looks nice though now we've got to this
step I'm actually gonna do a little bit
of a different look than I was planning
because I really want to taste zip
pigment so I'm gonna take a flat brush
and I'm gonna go in with this gorgeous
fiery or dingy red color pretty much the
reason I bought the pilot by the way and
I just want to push this in I'm gonna
push that in all over the ledge and
we're gonna try and really build it up
and I'm gonna bring that right up and
pass the crease
holy moly we better follow but that's
fine we took another brush and I'm gonna
blend that same color into the crease so
that orange color is pigmented it's not
probably as pigmented as I would have
liked it to be but for four pounds I can
I can stay I can stick around far leaner
I am going to be using the Maybelline
eye studio lasting drama
gel eyeliner 24-hour it's like the
little gel port and they give you this
little brush with it which on one side
almost like a lip brush and then on the
other side it's like I have one of those
sponges that everyone hates so I'm just
gonna put the cap back over that end but
I'm gonna use this little lip brush part
I have not done gel liner like this in
years so if I really miss out please be
gentle with me I remember when I was a
makeup artist people would use this on a
client because it just didn't move so
we're gonna do some wines today this is
gonna be okay
as this might take me a little bit more
time than usual I can see that glitter
through it and it's really annoying me
but that was my mistake the little brush
is actually created when I used to use
jail I used to use a lip brush to do my
gel liner it's great it's just a little
bit small I've got really big hands and
it literally is the size of my finger so
I may as well use my nail to do it so I
will not keep this I will be by it and
work I'm gonna repurchase this in the
right color and they'll use a lip brush
for it because that was really fun I
have not used a gel liner and so long
and I do think it gives you a different
look than using a felt tip liner
something that's great for covering up
Shamy eyeliner is mascara and lashes so
the mascara I'm gonna be using as the
lash sensational lash multiplying
mascara this is one of my favorite
mascara ever it is absolutely
unbelievable and then I have a big
little pair of pink Eagle lashes this is
this fail nada
and these are sold in super duct
retainer which I actually think is
definitely still a drugstore trace that
they're not mint but you can reuse them
loads and loads later up to ten times so
that's a component a time which is
pretty good considering whispies are one
use the only thing about this mascara
that I'm not buzzing about is it's quite
difficult to get take off it just means
that you have to spend a little bit more
time taking your makeup off and that's
not a bad thing so I'm just doing this
and I realized I have not done under my
eyes so we're gonna do top mascara and
lashes and then we'll go under our
eyeballs
I think I'm mascara it's great it's
really sticky like oil it sticks to your
lashes if you really build it up and
make sure lashes super long we're gonna
highlight our inner corner while we wait
and I'm gonna just use this gold right
here and the sleek palette this is the
corporate plate palette again when you
use this color to do my break one and my
in a corner I still need to weep from my
lashes to dry so I'm going to go in with
the gorgeous red color in the palette
and I'm going to run that underneath my
eyeball these I think so I've actually
used these types of lashes before and
they're really nice but the band is
stiff as hell so we're just gonna give
it a workout I'm gonna do it my little
freckle note and I think this is a Max
Factor later but it is a stupid cheap
it's like rounded and that's just what I
used to do my freckle and I keep on
telling you guys I hate it but I'm still
using it once later so I must not hate
it I'm sure it's from Max Factor and I
just stamp on from effect all already
yes I quite like that because it's
really dark it's more like a leaner any
of the bruise stuff that's try to use
it's really wishy-washy and I quit like
my faithful to be nice and dark I'm
gonna shoot off-camera and quickly do a
little natural brow and I'll be right
back to finish off the face okay we're
doing good I actually feel like I really
like this eye look I'm really happy how
it turned out it's definitely not
perfect but I don't know if that's just
me
maybe I'm not good at eyeshadow anymore
okay for lips I'm really sorry but I
thought that maybe you guys would more
appreciate me trying to find like a
perfect nude than having to do a great
color because I just don't feel like
doing a great color okay so I have a
bunch of lip liners I bought because I
ran out of this this is the Rimmel
cappucino lip liner and it is one of the
most gorgeous nude lip liners that
drugstore so I really recommend this one
but I want to try out this revolution
this revolution brands like caught my
eye so I'm gonna try out this color here
is chauffeur I bought a couple of colors
but I want to use this one first to see
what it's like two pounds fifty so we're
gonna use this to line our lips nice and
big as usual let's leave it Pinker than
I was expecting but that's fine I feel
like um I feel like they remind me of
the Urban Decay lip liners the way that
they are super soft and then they start
to dry but these dry quite quickly so I
like to spend quite a while over drawing
and things like that and I don't think
you get as much play time with these but
it does look nice Nathe color it's just
like a little bit later
liar from urban decay for what stick I
have here and this stayed on my hand all
day and night and I wash my hands and
had a bath and it was still in my
flippin hands so this has very long last
thing may be a good thing it may be a
bad thing long we're at matte finish lip
lacquer by makeup Academy D plays it's
good oh that is a really strong smell
Wow
okay right I'm just gonna pattern you
see the smell goes away not yeah nice
color smells gone I probably won't be
reading that again I can already feel
like it's really dry but for three
pounds it's not bad especially if you're
a makeup artist when I was starting on
Instagram I used to do a whole face of
makeup and then just take it off like
after I got a fool so if you were doing
that then fine I have a lip gloss here
from revolution this is the color b-roll
and I tried this yesterday and I really
like it so I'm gonna put this on top
this has a smell to is not as strong and
it's more like caramel that other smell
from the MUA lipstick was like chemicals
and fruit it was so weird
that smells like caramel and it's not as
nice so n total like I bought two
concealer extra foundation and I bought
this shadow thing that I didn't use
because I didn't like it and I also
bought like extra lip pencils I think
and taught all do you know what I'm
gonna do it I'm gonna add up and put it
right here in the screen for this whole
entire face apart for my brows but all I
used was eyebrow gel and yeah that was
it eyebrow gel so you can get that from
anywhere I actually think that this
turned out okay there was a couple of
products in there that I was like what a
bitch but I actually think that this
turned out really nice so you guys let
me know down below if you like the stay
love video it's a little bit different
from me if you liked coming shopping
with me I really had fun doing that so
we can you know we can keep that up if
you like let me know what you think of
the look do you think it as as nice as
my usual makeup do you think you can
tail its drugstore I'm really interested
to know all your thoughts donut below
and other than that I will see you in
the next video bye I need to tie my hair
up
smells ever really good words that
nothing you've ever seen clapping man I
look crazy
Oh God but I have to keep using
dramatized that's not word black chrome
it's not even black it's got glitter in
it
 okay we're just gonna use it anyway
