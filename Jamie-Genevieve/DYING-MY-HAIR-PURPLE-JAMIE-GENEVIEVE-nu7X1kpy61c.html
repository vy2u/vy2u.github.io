we are having a fun time with our hair I
have had blonde hair noted for
absolutely ages as you saw mr. royal
you'll know that I love bold hair colors
i had pink and teal and half white half
black like i like my friend hair colors
soak little got in touch with me and he
asked to work together and I thought
what better time than to make my hair
fun again the collection I'm going to
use a declared all color creed semi
permanent hair color and it's over it's
what in your cereal is so I have the
pink here this is called Flamingo and
leash use orchid as well as your violet
and my plan is I'm going to mix these
together with a little bit conditioner
and we're going to call my blonde here
and make it fun basically on the box it
shows you the color at this time then
you've got this chart at the back so
obviously I put blonde here I don't
think in mind adults are going to be in
between this so semi-permanent it
gradually fades and 15-plus washes make
life a little longer or more porous here
that is really what is very feminine
semi-permanent means it will last but it
will end up washing out which suits me
just fine as well yeah our music
failures so the first thing we do is we
put the Box well and si you've got
instructions are we brush and gloves to
apply it and then you've got your color
you've got your choose color so I try to
put a lot you get vegetable color I'm
going to make some fill one of these I
think Phil want a purple and pink and
Mexican conditioner because that we it's
also Kokomo conditioning treatment for
your hair which is good and then
obviously we've got the instruction here
always make sure your vision instruction
protest color may stain yes the pit
called in well applying yeah I'm going
to change entire gold t-shirt when I'm
doing this applying petroleum jelly or
conditioner or in the healing to avoid
staining and one we need is I'm going to
squeeze the color into a ball I'm going
to try it with the brush but I'm just
going to use my hand to really like
caught all my hair and then dry here
with the dark towel so basically first
thing was is wash until dried my hair
we're gloves and with section off my
hair and quartet and
is on you it for 20 minutes or for
bolder results you repress dirty and
then you rinse it steadily until the
water runs clear okay so it's kind of
let's go to look a little bit Umbreon me
obviously my roots are natural know
they're really dark and then the ends
are all blowing Vanessa's extensions so
I'm just going to dynamics engines my
own hair it's actually pretty dark well
as if you don't want to die you're here
permanently
you've also got a range of like hair
makeup which is a really cool idea so
you've got sharing those goals brilliant
amethyst and you've also got brilliant
debate there's actually causing more
shades and Nessie's are just because I
was saying and I'm going you the hair
makeup sticks I'm just going to go Phil
Phil pale and when you go ahead and just
dye my actual here but these are great
if your orchid I would as fun here but
you can be for shape we're good we're
going to do to the real side we're going
to do the whole time I'm going to go how
shower wash my hair and I'll be back
we're going to put the hair dye oh and
I'll be back I am still praying myself
oh come on makeup still faint so what my
hair brush and all my hair I told ride
I'm going to section my head off and put
it up here I'm going to get a chip of
the tank and the prep pal I've got
Flamengo and orchid and I put on a
really old black t-shirt because the
Hollywood shop owner and I don't really
care if I get color on it I'm going to
put a whole chip of each and the ball
and I just read that and it's actually a
living 11:00 loving that 11 series of a
semi-permanent color and respect shades
of the color makeup and just put it in
the chipper purple
after I'm going to get half that you've
been create a lot and then pink so they
look like this so both playing in the
park pal and I'm going to put some
conditioner and it just use whatever
conditioner you usually use and I'm
putting a fear right in there and then
I'm going to use this brush start mixing
it and the way you've got too much
products because spirit to have too much
than too little
geez this is bright
they're really beautiful it's not as
violent as before it's got a little bit
more warmth to it and ready for describe
heights but by better make sure we cover
it all
I'm going to use the brush whoo why
don't we have funding it again
something for the odd and then what you
can do is you can up look at that so
I'll just make sure you get all your
here I'm not going to take it right to
the root because my hair is brown anyway
the little brush is actually it really
helps fun risk is it but by but make
sure recording heal properly and I'm
going to go in with a pheromone attend
and just really massage and I used to do
my one here all the time and because I
put makeup on I'm not bored with I'm
going to hold in my hands and then paint
that on top of my glove and then massage
in there look at that
Diana's not actually that hard at all I
love it already
we've done the first layer and the tip
metal clip and put it down on top of my
little clean area once you get your
little routine you get it's pretty easy
and also actually think you would
struggle okay twenty health care it's
not difficult at all because it's a fun
color you can see exactly where you're
putting it so you can see if you've
missed any boats as well and mixing it
with a conditioner makes it kinda like a
treatment so obviously we're leaving
this or gonna leave it on for like 30
minutes
so imagine it with conditioner is like
you're giving your hero treatment that
the same thing was dying it and I just
kind of run my fingers down and massage
that into the year normal blood and I'm
just gonna literally whack
Lord more on top massage in the end I'm
going to put some in a little bit higher
it up just to make sure I don't have any
around on little blonde streaks I'm just
going to get all my hair on the top
give it a little twist and I'm just
going to pin it then please we're done
so it's all in there it's looking good
20 minutes for the car to see it and
from bull the result with statements I'm
actually going to wait statement it
because I actually love the color that
it's turning already so very minute and
I'm going to wash it off I'm going to
come back and sail it and see how else
whoa so I'm just in a little bit
research I can tell you guys what's up
the clean old color Cree
sanded permanent columns and eleven
cheese and a bleaching as well and then
the clear doll color cube here at makeup
comes in six shimmering shades so it's
like ten pewter color and it washes up
shampoo this is really good for people
that don't want to like permanently
percent even semi-permanently Dyer here
so good way to try out some fun colors
and you can just wash all so and we'll
leave this off now wash out and it'll be
right back
okay the shades reveal oh okay so all
that's left to do now is stale up my
hair I love it so I'm just going to stay
on my hair I'm going to dry it and then
give it a nice little soft curl and it
will be right back and show you the
finished finished look
that is me time you day I cannot believe
how vibrant that I can't leave her nails
in my hair field
I think Mexico condition I obviously
still get devise and see and of course
it a semi-permanent
when you start to wash oh that's when
you start getting that really made kind
of hastily look to the hair I'm actually
really proud of myself because I there
was never as the best at doing this but
I actually really really love it it's
just the kind of change that I wanted
obviously after my sentence where I had
kind of start to blonde here it's that's
how good I can all do sake naturally but
it's so I can't believe it I love it
like a whole new here to here cuz I
never having colorful here that just
brings its fast of next so you guys let
