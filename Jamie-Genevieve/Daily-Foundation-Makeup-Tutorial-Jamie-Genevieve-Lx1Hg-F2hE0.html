I'm going to go over my foundation
routine so I've done my eyes my lips
already and I'm just gonna jump in and
do everything I do to my skin on a daily
basis this is probably the easier
version of Emporia obviously I take a
lot longer than my contour and things
like that but this is my daily
foundation routine thanks so much for
watching see you see so started off with
a primer which is loaded Mercier
foundation primer all over my face and
then going on with skin base number
three but just a few shades too late for
me during the center of my nose middle
of my forehead under my eyes is will and
it's kind of like triangle shapes just
to left any kind of darkness I've got
there and the brush am using is just a
small buffing brush and put a little bit
of the foundation on my chin and the
sides of my jaw line as well going in
with a begger dual fibers we've our
brush this is called the stifling brush
I'm just blending that and underneath my
eyes again just buffing it into the
plain row and this is going to act like
a highlighting be underneath my real
color foundation stepping on my actual
color foundation in between the
highlight and just buffing that on I'm
not too worried about going over the
highlight because it was shown from
behind from underneath I've gone all
over my foreheads as well just buffing
in absolutely all over the face this is
the my actual foundation color this is
skin base and eight-point-five I'm just
making sure I'm covered in all areas of
my face blending it into the highlighted
base going around my brows with a
smaller brush just up blends in the
foundation M so it's a perfect finish
I'm making sure my neck is blended and
going over my lips a little bit as well
so when I over draw them the lane is
very very crisp going in with my dark
tan
mineralized skinfinish that's what I use
to contour so the brush that I'm using
is as a weaver luxe highlight brush and
I'm just following my contour and
buffing and circle motions upward
to blend and to my cheeks I don't mean
they're being almost I kind of Laden to
my core into a cuz I like a strong corn
so going on the corners of my forehead
to give my face a more oval shape and my
jaw as well don't say to the nose as
well for a slight contour then I'm going
in with studio doors can finish by Mac
and I'm gonna blame that on top of the
corn tear but just a little bit and I
start from right at the back of my
cheekbone and back at the weed zone just
to give my face that overlook again this
is perfect topping Mac's new mineralized
skinfinish which is a beautiful
highlight so going over the cheekbones
and down the center of the nose a little
bit and a touch of the forehead and a
little bit on my jaw line as well I put
in a little bit of a highlight on my
Cupid's bow as well just to bring my lip
so a little bit further using LMI
scholars powder in zero-one-zero a
completely translucent powder I just
powdered the center on my face or that
outside of my face can still get a
little bit chewy throughout the day and
that as my basic foundation routine
finished keep an eye out for a Gatorade
you with me soon to see my more dramatic
look thank you so much for watching
again guys and I'll see you next week
with a new tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
