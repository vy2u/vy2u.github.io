I'm gonna show you how to create this
entire look and I know I like a little
bit
she's long I got some new hair for the
week I hope you guys like it this is
probably my friend Betty over you see it
so yeah I hope you guys like it I got a
couple of requests for this makeup look
it is really really really easy it's
probably started to be my chemical -
look it's glam enough for any occasion
but at the same time it doesn't take too
long if you know what I mean so I'm
using a bunch of good products a few
favorites a few new products and if
you'd like to see how I create this look
then please stay tuned
hello this is what I look like and it's
gonna get fixed right now so the first
product I'm going to use is my Estee
Lauder advanced night repair bunny story
if the Lord was the first place that I
worked and the makeup industry so we
take one two three four five drops of
that and I know it's called advance
negative here but when I was with the
SEO team the head makeup artist said to
me use it day and night just use it DNA
and I got this big huge tub of it it
says my name on it and it's 115 mil you
can't actually buy them in a rear but so
features you can get a 30ml in a 50 ml
recommend trying it 30 ml first and see
how you get on with it but I remember I
used to love it and I don't know why I
don't use it anymore I think maybe it's
just because some old thing I want to
try new stuff but I might say it amusing
that again skins loving it I've got a
little bit of congestion here and that I
just can't seem to get rid of but I
think I need to start doing so maybe
peels or something but next product I'm
gonna use as my Chi press helio tropic
this is a great sunscreen it's all
natural which is really good for
sunscreen quite a lot of sunscreens the
ingredient that's actually the SPF is an
actor that good for your skin so this
contains I think it's iron oxide zinc
oxide 20% and that's what makes
a sunscreen by I really like it's a
moisturizer kind of primer and sunscreen
I like to use this that my skin next
product as my photography fluid 12
percent capacity favorite thing in the
world 20 quid of heaven so I'm gonna
take can I like five drops to that as
well and we're just gonna rub that onto
my skin this makes your skin look saw
glowy and radiant and beautiful but it's
also amazing and photography but the way
that it reflects your skin make sure
it's going to look super smooth super
hydrated just gorgeous
absolutely love it probably one of my
top products of the year actually that's
quite a good idea let me know guys if
you want me to do I know it's quite
early on but a best of beauty 2017
because I messed the boat last year I
was too late I think I've found more to
new products really late this year once
that sighs it's time for foundation the
foundation that I've been used and
pretty much every day is the hadou
beauty-full filter foundation I
absolutely love it one pump is enough
for my whole face this color is Chaz
Lynch's it's a little bit dark for me
now actually well it kind of matches my
shoulder was cool with it so the way
I've been using this is just applying it
with a brush I think that's the quickest
way to get it on obviously that's makeup
as something that I do that it's really
quick but with a wing or the wing no
absolutely love this fun day showing I
think it's me so it wears really
beautifully
it's a beautiful finish it's photographs
really well I think it's great
a lot of people have been asking me for
prefer to the same tea and I do and I'll
tell you the reason for that I think
this is easier to work with sainty if
you use a really certain way then it's
amazing but there's a couple of times
that I've tried to build up thin and
it's just gone really funny whereas this
one I can build it off I can apply
different products on top you don't have
to worry things like that but I think
the first time I use this foundation I
use two pumps and that was
the really really sick so tired
tape we're gonna assess in all of the
usual spots like the four dots
underneath my top ten anywhere we need a
little bit extra lovin well better
coverage my foreheads pretty messed up
great now and then I like to just use a
little touch right there and then I'm
just gonna use the same brush to blend
that out this brush is the blank canvas
cosmetics s22 brush i bag delivery of
these in a PR package and they are
lovely really really nice brushes and
then I'm just gonna pushing that into my
skin I'm gonna leave the under eyes to
last the cause what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get some of that concealer and put
it on my lid as well because this look
actually doesn't have much eyeshadow in
at all and then I'm just gonna bring
that up here see how quick that was it's
literally a two second and the nice
thing about this makeup is actually of
water this week I would have last week I
would a couple of times sometimes when I
was just chillin like I've worn at the
dam but my hair done she bloomed and
shot and award at an event as well
actually and it was just really nice
wore really nicely it's not too much and
actually I got a compliment or Mexican
at night as well as someone was like
what do you do bring it up down my neck
a little bit now we have a base next
thing I'm gonna do is take my Kat Von D
translucent powder and she's late
it's definitely not completely
translucent it does break it up but I
like that I've been using this powder a
ton the same way just over in my legs
under my eyes I don't know what it is
about this powder but it's so fine that
you can actually just put it anywhere as
I like to put it on mass mailings
it works really really real with a
foundation anyway onto my forehead as
well just mattify out those the textures
not kind of shiny I don't know think
about the huda beauty foundation that I
found I actually prepared it without the
primer I prepared it just with my usual
canna skin
underneath I think it wears a little bit
more natural I think with the frame
where it can get a little bit too matte
for me bronzer as Mac it gives me son
the usual and I'm just gonna warm up my
face and this is when my foundation
starts looking a little bit dark for me
but I do like bronzer
maybe I'll tiny drones naturally today
maybe I'm gonna brought into an a-cup as
well just because that is looking a
little bit pale today it runs up my
forehead now I'm gonna grab my Mac 150
brush and this brush sure is Marc Jacobs
lanes and last night lanes and last
night and I just like to use this site I
don't like it being too dark so I just
grab a little bit of a mixture here and
I'm just gonna apply that just above the
broad inside because I use blusher in
this tutorial lately and everyone is
like oh my god you look so healthy
that's what I'm trying to do we are
speaking through this you guys this is
exactly the point it's a fast and
effective makeup tutorial so the
highlighter I'm going to use is that
we've been different for me but this is
all for a highlighter and Rodeo Drive I
recently got a PR package from Beauty B
and always said I didn't actually
realize it all from a stock there but I
tried it yesterday and I pretty blinding
so I create a quick okay but who do you
know what I mean I'm just gonna apply
that and I'm started kinda bringing my
highlight down slightly just so you get
a nice glow from this front you really
don't need much of those you walk it
about looking like a disco ball we're
gonna do the usual sparse skip its ball
I'm gonna change my brush to a smaller
one to do my nose oh that's crazy
I'm gonna Pat that back on my nose and
then that is just a good way to come out
make sure everything's blending together
nicely the brush I'm using by the way is
the 134 luxe powder fusion brush from
zoeva it's my fave I'm gonna just
highlight up here this is one of my
favorite places to highlight to make
sure my skin looking healthy and glowy
it just gives a really nice shooting on
the skin there's one more thing that
I'm gonna do today but I want to this is
my little Tartus
Pro goal to go and this contour shade
here is my favorite so I'm gonna take my
smith one one eight brush and I'm gonna
contour my cheeks a little bit more and
then my nose with this brush as well
just like that and then for noise I like
to just get the brush and get it right
down the sides up here
right and where my broom meets my nose
you see the difference
sculpted and because of me is my big
brush it's just a little bit less
concentrated so it doesn't it doesn't
look as sculpted and this brush I don't
know it seems really bad but it just
fits in this little butt really well if
you need to you can get your friend
ation brush and just make sure that it's
not on down the center or the nose but I
really like that I think it doesn't look
too dark and a safe one or anything
that's what more was scared of skin is
finito apart from I was like to spray it
with something I got a bunch of stuff
I'm actually required in another video
about beauty because they've got loads
of sales on right now and I got a bunch
of new stuff to try and all of that I'm
actually really really excited about
I've been trying it out this week and
this is the cover FX eliminating spray
I'm gonna use that just now shake it oh
I really like that it's a really nice
next look no crazy and your face so I
would go off camera and do my eyebrows
and I'll be right back Jack says K mine
well I'm doing my brows strugglers
gayness bows chopped off once a like
that that's what's happening he's
getting neutered castrated they call it
is okay
castrated it sounds barbaric that's like
so doctors came in and he's asking what
we can do from to be nice I think we
should go and get my new buying cat new
bed new blanket new toy scrambled eggs
for dinner after some eyebrows I use my
iconic London bloke ish and I'm so
obsessed with us and my eye were brow
amplifier and dark brown see if you're
needing a new brow gel
I highly recommend
going and picking this up and trying to
because I bloody love it really good for
making the hair so nice and thick I
really like that I think it must be
drugstore if it's either yeah I just
think it's great and obviously the brake
cushion is like one of my favorite
things ever okay so for eyeballs really
really simple it's basically just I
really need a let flex and then liner
and that's it so I'm gonna take one of
my new brushes from blank canvas this as
the e20 brush remains in the other car
morphia leave a brush and this I'm not
using this and it's fill effectively but
again something that I think is amazing
and maybe should be on your trust miss
list or something but this is the warm
Brown obsessions palette by a hooded
beauty I've been using this a bunch it
still looks like it's hardly been used
it's a really gorgeous little pilot
really really liked it so I'm gonna take
the nude shade from that and put it all
over at my knee to zoom you in I think
as cameras quite dark today guys I'm
sorry affairs or working on it I'm
taking that nude shoot just the almond
light sheath and the palette and I'm
just putting that on all over and then
I'm gonna take a little bit of this
color here which is just a really nice
brownie transition shade and we're gonna
just put that and the crease just for a
little bit of eye contouring you don't
want anything too crazy but you don't
want it to be completely blank but this
is a lovely little palette really thanks
for traveling I took their specimens
when I went to London last week so you
might mean just a little touch of shade
then nothing else and I'm gonna do the
same thing underneath my eye but I'm
gonna mix these two colors together just
so it's a little bit darker and I'm just
gonna rub that under my eye with the
brush and that little trick great
definition but it also stops your
concealer from creasing and that's every
time pretty much we'll see how it's
looking but I'm sure that that's me time
for it later I'm going to use D once I
get the dog here off it will you use the
non stop bueno and this is by touching
sole this is like
say yeah and what we're gonna do is
we're going to do some flex no these
flights are slightly different to the
ones I usually do because what I've
started to do is bring them really high
up here so I'll show you so you can see
how that follows my lash line up the
weight usually when I do flips I wish to
bring them straight out the way but I've
started doing this I think it's really
flattering to my shape so I'm gonna
bring that back in itself okay same
thing another sight nice know what I
like to do now is I like to bring the
liner in here just to connect it up and
then it just keeps a little bit kind of
going back and forward and making sure
they're both even it looks a little bit
crazy just now because I don't have any
mascara on but I'm pretty happy with
that
something you can do if you feel like
you've messed up a little bit which
actually I do all the time it's get a
little bit with your concealer so I'm
taking a little bit more of my shape tip
with a teeny tiny angle brush this is
the Smith 203 brush you can see it's
just super money teeny tiny and I'm
gonna need that up and what you can do
is you can go in with your angle brush
again and just drag that down for
mascara I'm gonna use the Tarte gifted
mascara now if you watch her vlogs we
weekly vlog and I've been going to the
gym and I've been kind of trying out
different mascaras because I know that
some people don't love reading
absolutely no makeup at a job and some
people don't don't yet just the one go
completely bare face I've been
different mascaras and seeing what one
workspace and this does not move as
probably my new favorite mascara let's
just say that in every single video and
the lashes I'm gonna use are the Lily
lashes and the sale Miami I have three
favorite styles from Lily lashes and
they are mykonos can and Miami those
three sails are my absolute favorite I'm
just gluing these up and then while I'm
waiting for those to dry I'm just gonna
start putting on my mascara and you'll
see the difference just looks way more
human and it is really amazing for
building up your bottom lashes but you
have to go in a couple of teams that
like come on that looks so much better
now I'm just gonna stick these little
lashes on with my lash applicator from
Tarte so the way I have my little
freckle is I'll actually just get my
little liquid liner that I use for my
wings a little dot and then before that
dries I go in with my bright pencil my
throw beer from Urban Decay put it back
and then sometimes what we'll do is I'll
go back in and just do it one more time
so I'm starting to look more and more
like my bad sales and to finish off I'm
going to do my lips which is going to be
the Urban Decay lipliner and conspiracy
you guys know that I love liar like
plainer
this is Lake liar but just a little bit
darker so I really really like this and
then again I've got a product from Ofra
and this is the color Bailey or and I
tried it yesterday and it's beautiful so
I'm gonna use that
and now I'm just gonna go in with this
liquid lipstick and we're gonna kind of
blame the lipliner in the same time
if you want to be real smart about it
you can take your little angle brush my
earlier and just sharpen up that lip
line so you guys that is the final look
I hope you do like it like I said
earlier this is just a really really
easy go to look it's a little bit
different than my usual can I rendered
smoked I I so I thought that I would
film it for you guys and they saw a
couple of you guys asking for a tutorial
so here it is through the week last week
when you saw this look they let that I
hide the one was a little bit different
it was blondie multi stick by beauty
which is one of my favorite is I'm art
but aren't IP it died it died so I'm
gonna wait until them in the States
again then I'll pick another one up but
Marvin that I hope you like the slick
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
