I'm going to show you how to flick
valino fresh thyme
I had them tutorial on later before but
it's a little bit dated and it's not the
same steps as I follow note so I thought
I would do an updated tutorial on how to
get just beastin one blade oh really and
yeah if you'd like to see how I created
this I like stay tuned
I have already played my eye with lean a
little pin port leaing law pin port from
Mac and it's just the super feature one
that I always use and then from the
original chocolate bar palette I've set
the product with white chocolate and
which is just the latest ship and the
palette and yet now we're going to go on
top where salted caramel just here just
to start creating nice day
my mac brush is still dirty from
Halloween so we're using a different
rush today this is the segment tapered
blending brush and I do like it it's not
as good as the Mac one but Sigma brushes
are obviously really good place so yeah
not bad not bad at all so we're just
using that salted caramel shade and the
crease start building that up and then
as always I cannot make it slightly
darker just in here now obviously we are
focusing on layer today so I'm not
putting as much shadows I usually do not
as dark if you know what I mean and then
I'm just using the side of the brush to
place that and achlys an end we can
apply a little bit more flat to my face
just to help that and I'm going to win
with shade marzipan though just here as
my brow highlight which is actually a
lot more Goldy than usual but I'm great
time today and I'm just using my Smith
to 5/6 brush for this nice and precise
nice and flat and I just crease
when it won't make my system s23 to
brush and the she'd milk chocolate which
is just here and I'm going to it
slightly dark not release a little bit
not too much though I don't want it too
dark and then because we've got that
Remini highlight on already it actually
makes everything really easy it would
move it too easy
he'll come cheer now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take my Smith to five
sex brush again and the shade marzipan
again this semen to blow your highlight
and I'm just going to do a nice wash it
out when the lids I think doing this
just makes everything a little bit more
neutral a little bit more notch so as
really showman here actually the split
computer what I usually do usually stick
with my Mars but yeah I just I was just
feeling that get a win for now no for
the leaner part so like I said I had a
tutorial it was one of my really early
on tutorials in my youtube career and
and I was showing you guys how to do
Lena with tape so tape works late it's
fine to do it on yourself there's a
little bit of push and pull whether you
can use tape on clients and things like
that so tape is slowly but surely can I
get input to the side so this is a super
easy way and it's actually it's less
faff it's less it's less difficult I am
and all you need is concealer and a
little angle brush so the concealer I'm
using as Mac nw20 and studio finish
concealer so it's it's a very
recognizable little pot and the brush
I'm going to use is this Weaver this has
been robbed dogs I use it so much I'm
sure this is a brave line brush a link
it down below anyway and it's just a
really really tiny tiny firm angled
brush now all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
get a tiny little bit this concealer so
I just go straight and in our school oh
okay
obviously I've done this I already and I
just want to make sure that the state
used to work for me and things like that
before showing you guys and it does so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
look at my
in the meadow so see I'm lookin in the
matter have a look at with angle school
obviously this is easier to do when
you're doing both your eyes at the same
time so obviously I thank you guys back
at home we'll be doing this on both eyes
also this is my step for clients as well
look at yourself make sure that you're
getting your legs the kind of same angle
and then you go in with your angle brush
with the concealer and you just draw so
see can you see that line all I've done
and it looks like I've actually cleaned
up my eyeshadow which Angelou's quickly
but what I'm actually doing is I'm
tracing Mullane and because this
concealers slightly lighter than my skin
tone I can really see it and then all I
need to do now is follow this concealer
line with my eyeliner so the eyeliner
I'm going to use is my Kat Von D trip
right this is my favorite my favorite
eyeliner of all time I personally like
to start an air corner so I just get my
later I was find it easier to look down
anti-matter note with my eye calls but
it is slightly open if I slightly open
and I'm just going along the lash line
hey I make a little bit thicker in that
or corner
so I've got a nice line right along my
lash site and I what I'm going to do and
I'm going to treat would follow that
concealer line all the way up to match
so it's just pretty much for the end of
my blowers less is quite a long flick
you don't need to do it this long but I
always can add remain quite low
I'm going to get slightly thicker just
here
and then a good thing is if you make a
mistake so it's a little bit further
than which I'm not happy about you can
just go back and make your concealer
brush and you can go end at the end and
just neaten that up and what you can do
is you can just gonna play around
obviously my life should make a huge
difference and this look so soon as
they'll actually school line alum or if
it's looking okay or not but I'm looking
in the mirror and then slick and same
I'm going to pop some mascara on oh so
I'm going to use might artist mascara
and which is just black to create nice
full looking lashes and I'm going to
focus extra mascara on the bottom lashes
the lashes I'm using CR the huda beauty
flannel ash they are just really lovely
lashes I really quite a lot and I just
find a new look hey so I am happy and
I'm using the deal glue that I always
use the green brush-on glue it's not
putting the layer too green another
script you know the drill so West liner
I just think a lot there's a lot of play
around with that there's a lot of kind
of neaten it up and then this concealer
truck - they really works for me it just
means that you know that you're not
going to be leaving with blue liner and
then once you're finished you can just
kind of blend away the concealer I don't
even really need to blend it away in
this kit in this case I didn't use too
much but yeah it's just the easiest
thing ever and it means that if you're
like me and you like to do your kind of
foundation first these days then put in
tape on to get your liner we just take
that foundation right off again so just
a little bit better and then it spotless
LaShawn I'm going to use my heartiest
lash applicator my favorite thing ever
if didn't already know
and that is finished okay guys and if
you're wondering about my lipstick I am
waiting fortune by Tarte is one of their
new lip paints and and if you're
wondering how I do my brows I can link
down below Meili it's predatorial using
salt that is exactly what done today but
I did trim my brain here so it doesn't
look so ah as always you guys I'll link
everything I use down below if you try
this trick and it works for you please
do let me know on Twitter or Instagram
or any of those good things and I'll see
you next time with another tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
