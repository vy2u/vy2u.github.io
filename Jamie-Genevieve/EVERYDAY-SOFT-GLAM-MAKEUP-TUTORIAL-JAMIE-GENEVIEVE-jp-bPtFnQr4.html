I'm gonna show you how to create this
entire look is something that is really
different from me it's just more kind of
natural and still go on but we've gotten
lashes alone the coverage is not as full
not strong a contour you know
everything's just a little bit more
skills back for me and then I just tried
something a little bit more fun on the
eyes using a couple of products that I
have not used on this channel before so
I really will be like it if you would
like to see how to create this look then
please stay tuned so let's get started I
need to get my freshly blown out here by
Jack Baxter my face I have already done
all my skincare it is done
my face looks fresh let me know if you
want an updated skincare routine I kind
of want to wait until the slope guys
going this I've called them tequila he's
my friend
not really prema nobody used to be is
the Y sale Oh leverage primer this
stuff's brilliant it's really really
nice underneath the OL iris foundation
which I really do like as well but see
this time my she doesn't sit anymore so
I like still using this trainwreck do
this and you can see it just runs it's a
really liquidy formula it's really like
if you formula but I like that because
it just sanctuary in and I just use that
came out all over I'm not so worried
about that I would say to my face rub
that but it's got a really nice texture
to it it's really light citrate and it's
not like a good easy layer before your
friend earrings like that so I really
really care if foundation I'm going to
used to be as the L'Oreal Paris Pro glow
foundation they have recently brought us
to the UK is exclusively available on
Amazon so I know for a while it was
really difficult to get as I picked it
up months ago maybe like a you go in the
states and I tried oh and I liked it
but it's basically a medium coverage
radiant finish we're gonna try it so the
cars I've got here are 205 and 209 I'm
gonna take a little bit the 205 in the
back of my hand it looks okay but I just
want to turn
a little bit because once much my buddy
I'm just gonna apply it with this brush
here this is like a tart brush and I
kinda wanted to do the layer coverage I
don't know how it's gonna go I've got my
concealer I've got my tart tip concealer
so we can add coverage but yeah I don't
know what other case I'm going for today
at all but I've basically been looking
on Instagram a lot and I'm the CM like
really beautiful shimmery eye makeup
with no false lashes flawless skin
that's not totally covered you know it's
a very different style of makeup than
I'm used to really nice and fresh
looking and I can still see my skin
through it which is actually it nice too
I think what I steiner's cut out even me
out and made me match was good I'm gonna
add a little bit of the two five shades
just in the center see if it can build
up a little bit I kind of never using it
and then my idea was once I've got a
nice base of the solid I can spot
conceal with my shape tape yeah and
build coverage that way rather than have
really full coverage all over but the
reason I really wanted to get into this
foundation and try it probably is
because lost her Lux Katy swears but at
least she loves that like she even
message me and say it is lit it does
look pretty nice you can really see the
finish of the foundation is really nice
I'm gonna go in with my shape tape in
the shade tan sans this is dark I think
I used to use medium underneath my eyes
but I'm trying this thing where I go
with
closer to my skin color and it makes it
look less dramatic I'm just gonna do my
usual sportster I've covered a Twitter
one set and then just here is like my
problem area right now so I'm just gonna
do that - even though and I'm also gonna
use this as a shadow base so this is
from the same set as the turret ones own
Lisa don't even
as funny guys I'm just playing that in
little circular movements the hill play
into it I'm trying not to move it around
too much
this is a nice size bro I'm not sure
that I would use that foundation as I'm
having a bad time with my skin like I
know that I'm really lucky with my skin
and my skin here seems to be working a
treat I don't have too many blue coats
or anything it's a powder on my face I'm
just gonna use my favorite this is the
Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish powder in the shade number two
I'm just gonna push that judgest we
don't want it which is the middle of my
face and by pushing it in it means that
you're not wiping away all the coverage
you've just spent on your oil building
our I'm just gonna take another smaller
brush I'm just gonna powder underneath
my eyes I'm just gonna quickly set my
leg as well while I'm at it
to bronze I'm gonna use my butter
bronzer
look you guys see is the light one or
the normal one and it just says bronzer
on the back I wonder if this is before
they brought another shade but I feel
like it's quite light it doesn't look
like it would make much of a difference
but it does and I'm just gonna bronze my
face up just a usual spot do it a little
say to mine or scoop thing
okay the winds are right up and the
brush I'm using right now is the Smith
one maneet brush I really I really love
Smith brushes I think we're nicely
bronzed
I'm really trying to stick to this
natural ish vibe I'm going to give my
face a quick spray of the all nature
secondly by Urban Decay this is the
pollution Protection one the highlighter
I'm going to use it's wee bit different
this is the NARS highlight and 40
difference for difference and I'm going
to use this just on the top of my cheeks
don't like usual usual places everywhere
pretty much this is not super late the
resin tank actually lovely
Genoa is not chunky but I think that's
it's not chunky highlight right but it's
got the PR package and I know that
they've got a really lovely shade range
so it cares for all skin tones this is
the second lightest I think it's
actually not even that light like it's
not what super light maybe if you're
super pale it's not gonna be the one but
I think this is really pretty
and then I which was actually really
good if you're pale mmm-hmm
I feel like I'm so conservative today
it's good it might be knows that a
exclamation mark oh I'm going to just
highlight my browbone with a lot of
shadow brush that's highlighters buff
like it's a nice bike pan you get to 14
grams I really don't know if that is
good or not
I'm gonna use my little Milani blush
chart in the liminal so I think is one
of my favorite blush here tonight I
don't really use blush though maybe
that's why cuz a friend when I like
there's gonna use that to come onto the
apples of the cheeks it's so cute
don't I look happy and beautiful I'm
going to genuine eyes I'm really happy
with the way the skins look naturally
for eyes I am going to be using at the
pure boxycharm palette this is what it
looks like it's a really nice mix of
shades there you've got no there's
actually not that many warm Browns in
here which is you know nude for me I use
the palette tons when I was away with
them and its really lovely the pigments
are beautiful the aisle if I'm gonna
create to do is I'm trying to go for
something a little bit more supermodel
II go I'm not like Instagram I'm talking
like red carpet beautiful timeless glam
not asking so much first thing I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go in with the little
transition color I think I'm going to go
in with this orange guy here it's cold
Nicki we're just gonna pop that in the
crease and we're gonna bring that I just
- can I
the beret and I just wanted to do this
transition because I want something
matte to create that really nice blade
up towards the brow and they are
thinking about you're gonna use quite a
lot of shimmer and eyeshadows today I
have been super inspired by part
McGrath's Instagram videos if you don't
know what talking about just look up her
Instagram and play whatever look I'm
gonna go before it's all shimmer all
over I underneath a little bit of a
darker shimmer and then watch this
beautiful right
that's what inspired me so I've never
really done anything like this before
but we'll just try it together okay I'm
gonna go in with charm right just here
we're gonna cool all over the lids we're
gonna go up to the crease I've got
another product from the Neos
intensifier oh and also I feel like the
filter that's on those videos it really
makes the metallic standard and I do
actually have a Pat McGrath pilot aboard
at the last time I was in the States but
I don't really want to use it so so it
costs one hundred twenty-five dollars
before tax and honestly I don't ever
feel a bit doing a tutorial with it
because how many of you guys want to
spend $125 in a pilot you know pretty
crazy okay so we're doing shimmer all
over I'm gonna start to bring it up wool
I'm getting some full of it but I've
already printed my face so it should be
the same yeah brush you know me from the
back it's quite a lot I'm gonna go in
with a slightly more fluffy brush and
I'm gonna go in with this color here
Alliance and we're gonna start to kind
of smooth viously it's a shimmer
maybe I'll go in with this color and see
what happens this is atl atlanta that
more like what I'm talking about this is
so weird
doing a shimmer all over I just want to
be amazing okay what I might do is go
back in with my fluffy brush and just
use little circular
to help blend them all together now I'm
gonna go end up with DC and Alliance
which is the darker shimmer and I'm
going to go all underneath my eye it
does actually look really nice but I've
just got so much shimmer under my eyes
now I don't think the shimmer shades are
made to be blended like that because I
have to let her all over my foundation
now I'm going to try and patch this out
that actually worked okay so when you're
doing this I makeup if you are doing
this eye makeup do your eyes first
I've just had to add more coverage under
my eyes which is fine this is this deal
up magnificent mantle eyes in the shade
Kenton absolutely beautiful look at that
so I'm going to take a little Mac brush
little like normal eyes shadow brush and
pick some of this up and I'm gonna bring
that pretty high up so when you look
forward you can still see it and an Old
West these little ports of Steel a thing
you get a liquid with it but it doesn't
make you look chunky enough like I like
the weird texture this case I gave it a
little spray of the Urban Decay all
nighter and it seems to actually be
working bare so I take everything I said
back is this why people practice their
makeup pollutes before they film you
know what we're all friends here you see
my trials and tribulations I'm gonna go
right and matter coroner with us just to
add a little bit a date that I'm used to
- scheme' D for me right now a medieval
end with the shades do it here that's a
super pigmented so I'm just gonna take a
little tiny bit on this brush and I'm
gonna just smoke it into my era
coroner's and I'm just gonna use it tiny
little circular movements yeah that just
added a little bit more drama
romantic do it a nice little touch that
underneath the eye or coroner almost
like may see you know may see wool
glaives but it's super definitely for me
but Yolo for this look I'm not we'll see
what happens but I didn't want to use
false eyelashes so what I'm gonna do and
I've got my little lash curlers from
House of lashes you get my eyelash with
a curl and I'm going to use my iconic
London boom lash mascara this is fast
becoming one of my favorite mascaras and
I'm just gonna add a real serious cool
of this stuff and I always can I like
take away the excess because that's how
you end up with some being too chunky
yeah it looks good and I'm gonna just do
a real cool on my bottom lashes as well
that's my Scottish really good for
bullrushes for my eyebrows I'm honestly
not sure because I could happy leave
them like that but what I'll do is I'm
gonna use my Venice at cabrillo know you
guys make up seaton that I am part of
the brain is hurt bro heroes but you're
really excited about and it meant that I
got said all the right products and I
used this for the first time I love the
place in my brain pagelet I was a little
bit I never have tried this I know I
love this and now I want this to be one
of my favorite things it's so good so
I'm going to take a little bit of that
on the brush that comes with I never
used the brush that things come with but
it's great so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to use this ten hands
this shape Vanessa's this year for by
the way I'm just gonna sorry at that
arch I'm not just seeing this but I
think I like this way better than the
Anastasio stepbro
because I was using that for a while
again
and it's very easy to use I think the
product is difficult to pick up in the
brush I think it's too late to boat a
little bit especially when you've got a
dark color and now all that so to do the
lips so I'm gonna zoom you out we'll do
them together
Wow I really like this makeup I feel a
little super feminine and pretty okay
I'm going to do my quick 3fl for what I
think what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to use my Charlotte Tilbury iconic
nude lip cheeks which is a really good
lip liner to enhance the center of my
lips make them super powdery like normal
and then we're just gonna put kind of
natural as your lipstick on so let's try
this first and you don't have done there
I've just Lane the center of my lips
this is crazy I'm just throwing out so
many new techniques out there I don't
know if this is going to look good but I
basically lamed until about here and
then just feed it into my natural lip
color because I just want my lips to
look kind of natural ish
I'm gonna try a driver by me believe you
guys alerts as one of our favorites yeah
a little bit I'm going to do to make
sure everything blends in and should use
my finger so you guys guys the finished
tutorials I hope you made it this far
I know there was a couple of moments in
there that we didn't really know what we
were doing
that is what makeup is all about it's
all about sitting down and having fun
and I just thought I would do it on
camera for you guys today so I really
would be like it's a little bit
different from me but I am let me know
if you like it down below this is a
super different scale than for I suppose
I'm known for I don't want to try
something more can a may be simple and
easy and a little bit more timeless as
well I think this would be great for any
occasion at all for example I'm going to
the gym in a couple hours so I really
hope you like this tutorial and I will
see you next time with another one
