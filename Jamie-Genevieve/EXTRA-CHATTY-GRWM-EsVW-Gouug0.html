palette hopefully when I'm in New York
I'm going to try and see the guys from
church it's been said I've not seen him
since Bora Bora but I'm just going to
use this palette see because I love it
and it's assumed because somehow
actually not going to be petty angry
it's a beautiful palette and the Pegman
to me is and the court is incredible so
don't think that just because we went on
trippin with heart that we would lie
about the quality of the product because
I want this palette so much oh no one
would is doing neutral iron I really try
not to do that neutral I the pop color
hose that I say for next year more than
anything because there's a few things
that have been happening that I'm not
really going to chat about a movement
but basically nature's shaping up to be
pretty exciting can't we can't wait can
we

really strange today so sort of it I'm
going to dust be my undereyes just hey
so forever faith in the urge to join you
to some guide which it looks like just
nope I promise it will be okay so I'm
going to go in with the obviously this
is my favorite color in the whole planet
I'm going to use that underneath my eyes
this is my favorite step ever because it
just stops every sense increase in your
my lash line
when you're doing this part if you're
stressing out and you think wow it's
just it just looks too much just add a
little bit more a little bit more I
guess brush a lot more fee and 507 I'll
be ready for my New York vlog it's going
to be amazing and my Instagram is going
to turn into a travel Instagram
obviously because I'm going to be taking
some snaps taking some snaps of some
coffee some coffee with cutes for one
top very Instagram herbal this is
definitely my favorite she personal care
to do and then I love to blend up
towards the glow with my brush at the
same girl

on the inner corner okay I'm going to
use the shake trendy which is green so
if any of y'all come with me and see
that my looks
Harold and you chilly it's like a do
dual chrome so you know oh and then I'm

everyone's excited for the holidays
whether you're sailor breathing or not
hopefully you'll have some time off span
or your family
I feel so colorful shorten we need some
lashes and why I do with these are cold
yeah actually I think they're called you
mean and they're just lovely lashes
super cute I'm going to glue those up
stuff come on do mascara and then I'll
show you milena for everyone that's
asking I really good my Christmas gift
video again
I'm still touched at how many of you
have asked as I and the bastard again
which is Nathan so I'll be doing that
when I get home from New York so it's
pretty much for last-minute panic bozos
I'm trying to think up this Jason else
of what to tell you guys I always think
I'm not spoke to your new jizz and then
when I got to film on like yes or were
see multi more Julie unfortunately I
missed the two fees party and nearly
I've got invited and I thought I don't
know they accepted work over that or
without paying the first week in
December so I was devastated to
Messick's it look like a blast and there
were so many of my friends that I've met
through YouTube that really oh and I
never get to see them some of them are
in Australia America all over the place
me oh my god no I know what these lashes
are the cocaine these are the cans
lashes oh man they're so nice one of a
few bad items Jim you in for the whole
soy guys I just got too caught up in
there the chatty part and they get ready
with me part just using my little tart
doodad to squish them on honestly the
best creation ever
okay I think I did it I'm not gonna lie
and I'm not the easiest thing in the
world to do because you can't really see
um I'll do like it though okay okay okay
oh um no crap same stuff here it
does it says my favorite new that was
Robin okay I'm just going to clean out
oh well that's not actually bad as I
thought I've never lived in empty so I
look from far to him not am organized
for that but I will see that I have
completely hit the pattern on my NARS
Laguna bronzer I'm a big fan of it I
really really can't I just use it with
my little my little my bag aim for two
brush and just going to do a bronze no I
really honestly think it's great I don't
know whether it's just beautiful on top
of this foundation mixture but what I've
been doing is I'll use this bring up the
my neck so I'm actually just Brandon
like normal with a big brush in my NARS
so just gonna go all over it's not all
really contour Ethan and then I'll go in
with my Smith one-one-two brush and my
Mac dark turn blue and say which is like
it's quite quite a bit darker show you
the comparison it should look a testing
tool isn't it go all in with my dark tan
which I think's more pigmented as well
and I'll just build that up a little bit
and that's been my favorite thing lately
they're just a little sunshine during my
nose I'm just going to use it my bag for
all poll for all team sake I don't want
to use any liquid highlights just
because my scanners if you're gonna be
the extra oily basically I'm feeling
hormonal and women later I don't want to
put oil on my face so I'm going to use
my bare foot or pub and this is going to
bring light into my life ah mm-hmm
really everything's fine ten - you don't
like it you can check yourself in the
reflection edge just highlights an
important bit so when you use at the
brophy start by over here and people
always ask what is it like compared to
blow ways I think it's pretty much the
same honestly I think it must be the
same one of the same products for some
like to do the ends on both of them
first make sure that the highest point
of your bow is the arch as well okay and
then I'm going to use just the tip of
the brow pencil to sketch underneath I
like to bring this back a little bit
Lord date as well and then I'm just
using we here leak strokes from the line
just get it looking a little bit thicker
at the front drop right here my eyelash
the huge so I'm going to grab a little
bit of my favorite until a Maybelline a
razor eye and this brush is a little one
called the smudge out the two two
sections Weaver but I like to use it
because if you look it's like a little
kind of firm shader brush I'm going to
grab that
and I just like to sketch a clean line
is right at the front of my brow and on
until it makes it such an offence it
makes the Blues look like a little bit
like like oh I just got home from an
all-night Benj - well would you like a
job skin down okay lips
I just wanted to Nativity that's all I
want
you know what I'll show you I can do I
went to village I'm gonna do what I like
I'm gonna do a wood that's it that's the
end of it I'm going to use my slick
stick by Illamasqua I've been back love
the notes and I'm going to line my lips
I'm going to use colour-pop lippie stick
n cookie which is Matt and this is
actually one of my favorite lip products
and for what brewed it but I just found
it so ah it's such a nice nude so take
this Matt I don't think it adds should
promote I think it goes on really really
creamy but it does last longer than a
sheer lipstick would and then I'm just
gonna powder like this Center my face
because I just feel like an absolute
grease ball today although I will say it
I have a skincare tutorial coming up
really really soon and it's a sponsored
video so fat Grainger gears there maybe
skip it but I'm yeah I'm showing you
guys all the lip stuff I've been using
and my skin has been amazing up to like
yesterday so you guys that is me
finished
I am ready I'm really really excited I'm
going to actually when you're gonna go
and edit this video and put it up
