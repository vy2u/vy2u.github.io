week we were going to do an updated
contour tutorial so I think I'm using
pretty much all brand new products since
the last one the last one it was quite a
while ago so I think I'll be really fun
to try all this stuff and yeah I've been
trialing laws new products recently and
I can't wait for you to hear what you
guys think and make sure you like and
subscribe if you would like to see any
of my future videos and if you'd like to
see how I climb to her and highlight my
skin stay tuned okay let's do this so
first thing we're gonna do is stop
getting excited with my beauty meal
every it just came Oh can't wait soften
it and enjoy so the first thing I'm
doing is I'm taking it some Mac Medina
great formula softening lotion and I've
had this for ages and I don't really
reach for it all that often but it was
really really good
so indifferent use that to cleanse my
skin okay
now I'm gonna take my vitamin enriched
face base from Bobbi Brown if this was
in my Christmas makeup gift ideas video
and I've been using it for about a week
now and I say it's one of the best
creams of use on my skin for underneath
makeup Israel so they just smooths out
your skin and it's super hydrating and
it surrounds I think like orange
cheesecake or something like but I hate
cheesecakes ordinal hired thing that
needs better is negative remember so
we're gonna rub that in twice again
avoid then my eye you know obviously cuz
I've done at my blazing IV cup already
I've been it seriously it's fully
Etruscan recently
okay so nice and red next thing I'm
gonna do is take and there's another
product for my Christmas gift idea video
it's the vidiians feel from Illamasqua
I'm going to take a little bit of that
not too much I'm just going to take it
from the light and I'm gonna pop that
just at the highlighted parts of my face
I love this it's cool to Li change
through your foundation if you know me
already you'll know that this is only
the first day
okay that was the baby I would happily
walk around my feet it's just like this
and be happy
next I'm going to do it I'm going using
a foundation I've been using this image
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation for
last to release roughly and it's
definitely my new favorite I love this
and I'm going to scoot up a little bit
the back of my hands or two pumps is
usually a little bit too much but
because hundreds of automatic make up to
the elite want that extra coverage and I
first struggled to put this on my skin
at the best thing I've found is there's
a weave arts getting finished brush I do
like using sponges but I'm very lazy
so no I can't something's off I'm gonna
rush I can't avoid going and getting the
sponge prepped you don't even think that
it's all this it's can finish brush it's
the one or two leave a brush from the
drawers golden at volume two okay and as
my favorite so what do I get a
foundation and then I'm just gonna stuff
all that on all over so just a patting
motion but all over and you'll see in
the coverage is just I'm seen
and when I've been using this foundation
I have been using these two primers
underneath and it's last and me all day
but I do find using these the full
motion to this foundation to be the best
and when I use the sponge I actually use
a lot more of the foundation leaving on
the rise quite a few English in just
like so I'm going to use concealer to
buff that or line so the coverage of
this foundation I would say is medium
but Belle's ball two Phil and si one
added coverage I'll go in with a
concealer though for league sports and
dark circles and things like that
let's just idea what it use my old sieve
that says and naked skin concealer from
la hora de que urban decay and the shade
late neutral and I'm just going to use
this at the highlighted points of my
face
so just for a kind of put the highlights
at almost their radiance feel and then
I'm just going to use this little jewel
fiber brush I don't know here I go of
this I'm pretty sure
just had no one blonde Jill fiber brush
and place you can get them off eBay and
things like and I'm just going to buff
this concealer in and that's just what
I'm going to go underneath my eye
makeups this is how I keep my smoky buff
concealed it's in time my foundation and
do the states please okay I'm gonna
leave that blended just like that for
the no I've been very big dark eyes to
do have that guys okay the next thing
would wind up with as the film-star
bronze in ghoul from Charlotte Tilbury
this is something that's just recently
came into my life and I am big fan after
a few tries so I'm gonna use a sculpt
powder first and I'm just gonna check
out my cheekbones and we do a little bit
more forehead as well and a lot that my
job I'm just going to show you how I do
that
so starting from the back of the ear
okay so starting at the back of it here
back the cheek
and she's a small movement from the moon
tone and then little circles just to
bring that contour up now I'm going into
a job that's more actually not
underneath anything else I suppose and
then I'm just going to go on top of my
forehead and they'll go I taking about
the large foreheads but I still contour
a little bit
and now I'm going to use it in the kind
of contours of my face or say to the
noise and the brush I use for that was
this Weaver luxe highlight brush in 105
and its really good recording - nothing
just glue this exact shape that you need
to get a ton at the back of the
chipboard and things like that and we're
going West a day later partner and I'm
just gonna it's cold I can delete highly
or so for me it's a little bit sheer I'm
going to use that just to a decade a
nice little warmth to the face so we're
exactly cheap ones
yeah absolutely like that that's
actually love thing so if you wanted to
create an actual can a bronze and
highlight or I would just stick to what
I've done here and I'm gonna do just now
is I'm going to go in with mac
accentuate which is a shaping pose or
boats for highlighting aim it's this
code here I'm gonna use this underneath
my eyes there's a product that you can
get it in in some Mac stores so I'm just
going to use bags under my eyes and that
just kind of left everything and you can
adapt from beneath the eyes and also say
it's any cleanings as well so it's
pretty good and started using that all
of him and clients and it's probably my
new favorite product for furnishing a
makeup
it's just saw highlighting underneath
the eyes and so if you want to be quite
natural with your highlight and contour
I would leave it like that it's just
like a nice soft chisel and I can a late
glow I'm gonna go ahead and make it up
her and stronger so I'm gonna go in with
my favorite special clear blush by Mac
in this is just a powder blush it's
matte and you can get it all your aimed
let's go so I'm gonna use this rate the
back of my cheeks the key to access to
users voice to it's all that you can
because it is a pleasure you can get a
call a little bit more on to the cheek
with this note what would have going way
is my zoeva luxe face focus brush and
this is a new eyeshadow I got from nabla
it's cold water dream there's a nice
adult but look at them you see that
Jesus so yeah I'm a big fan of that so
we're going to try this in the face for
the first time
sooo days it's so beautiful
may I try again
I'm so happy today
okay well I think that's me living my
base life that's gonna ever happen
geez now all I do is fix my hair and the
lipstick and it'll be right back
and oh that's it there it was I added a
left so I used still in like twenty nine
and something else
invasion invasion a high drama like
stick house matte lipstick so I spy
jarred cosmetics as well everything that
I've used I will less the down the wall
for you and I hope you like to update
its quantity total so and thus a line I
usually do cream contour or nama kinds
but obviously on myself I find this to
be really easier and the most time
effective way to get my contour on so I
can leave the house and do things I hope
you guys - like I said you'll be back
next week with another one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
