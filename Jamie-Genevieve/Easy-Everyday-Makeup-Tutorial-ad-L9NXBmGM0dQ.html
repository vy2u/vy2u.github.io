week I have teamed up with Rimmel London
to bring you this super easy super quick
makeup tutorial and which is perfect for
it work screw all anything quite chilled
and oozing we're doing this look as
because we are celebrating the launch of
the new app so basically what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you how to
use the app I'm going to create this
look and then I'm going to get you guys
to use that on me so basically what you
can do is you can steal my look so I'll
always I'll last everything that I've
use down below but what you can do is
you can use this app on anything so you
can go on your favorite instagramers
account you can go and you can use
magazines you can flip through your
magazine and if you like someone's
makeup in that magazine you can steal
their look and I'm going to show you how
to use the app in just a second but if
you'd like to see how I create this look
and if you like to steal it at the end
please keep watching okay so the way
that we use this app I go in the lap and
Lourdes or just what we're doing right
now
perfect so it's so pretty easy to use
you can still do it quite just what
we're going to do today and so let's
steal the look okay so it comes up like
this so I could put my we face in there
just no but there's no makeup on it so
there's no point in doing that in the
picture that I found that I like aids of
Kate Moss so I look at my laptop and I
find it this really nice picture to keep
more it's when the wheat milk Foundation
was launched and I just think your
makeups really really pretty in it is
really nice kind of soft as well which
is what I've been digging and she's
learning the week and up for injection
so what you do is you grab your phone
can you see that so I'm getting our we
face in this box yeah oh here we did it
so it's killing the look it says you can
try it on which is the button at the
bottom so we were going to try the lick
on so we're going to play this try on
and then you try on to look can you see
but basically it's raising it just shows
you exactly what the makeups going
look like on your feet cool and then
what you can do is you can match with
Rimmel London and it shows you all the
products that you'll need to create the
look genius so I have a few Rimmel
goodies em and I'm going to use these
products to create a similar look I'm
going to do a wee bit different so you
guys can steal my look so I'm going to
use a lot Mike sportsy first I'm going
to do is I'm going to put my base on so
this is Faxon perfect by roma des jahres
smoothes resurfaces bright ends
mattefies and protects everything so
does actually everything we wanted to do
it so I'm going to get some of the back
of my hand
and we're going to put that one all over
Wow you do not need that much of this
stuff
nice I feels really good actually so
must I concentrate that frame right and
my t-zone oversee and we're going to go
in with the foundation now and the
foundation I'm going to use is a wake me
up foundation and we just got tons of
button bitman seeing it I'm asking to
throw my hair up okay let's put this
foundation on so I'm going to get a
couple of pumps that and the shade I'm
using is 200 soft beige which is a nice
warm tan color because we're going to be
a bit more of a Sun Coast look to do so
I just stepped in that foundation on all
over and I think this is one of the most
popular foundations everyone's loving
the glue and then I'm just going to put
in back in I had to go over my lips a
little bit just because my lips have
such a high color that I find them quite
distracting when I'm doing my makeup no
no okay so once that is on I'm going to
swap over and we're going to use the
match perfection turn one can see that
in highlights sir
so if one of those ones it's got bleep
in at the top and the color I'm using
there's a soft beige give up we squeezed
to bring the product up we want more
squeeze and I'm just going to use that
and the high points of my face pretty I
would usually put my concealer my nose
onto my forehead and my chin as well and
it's nice because this is a two-in-one
highlight or you can bring the tray up
your cheekbones as well then we can
blend then again with the same brush
just a foundation brush that witch put
in a to reduce season myself
super easy to blend and it goes such a
nice finish good coverage as well from
Rio de Janeiro's I'm going to go in with
my state my long lasting trace photo and
this is in the color warm beige 0:06
and we're just going to Pat this on
underneath the eye just to mattify that
day and then I leave it in the center as
well so because we're doing a nice cat
gluey more
scan focus look that is why I'm using my
rotation factor so I'm doing my beast
first every said now we've got our
friend issue on we're going to go end
with a little bit of highlight okay I'm
going to go in I've just tried us in the
back of my hand because I've got that
other one but look at this
haha so this is the good to go
highlighter so it's a it's a cream
highlighter which I've been use and
clean highlighter should be real now and
you can use this before foundation you
can use it after like I'm doing I'm just
going to get a sponge pick up some of
that product and I'm going to just bring
a set along my cheekbone that is
beautiful love it
another thing you can do with this
highlighter is because it is liquid you
can mix it with your foundation so that
goes a really nice glow to the skin and
general and then you can still go in
with a little sponge and just kind of
intensify that when your cheek points
and now it's bronzed up the skin I'm
going to use the natural bronzer from
Rimmel this is 0-2 too sudden bronze the
color so it's just like a nice dark
brown really and I'm just going to pop
that as I cannot overall call into it
but I'm also just to warm up the skin
just what I was one and so I just wanted
to do it something really fresh and
sunkissed
so that bronze I was double it up it's a
really nice contour actually my skin's
like a nice and warmed up my highlight
is still popping let's move on to rose
so first I'm going to use is the Rimmel
row this way and it's just like a really
nice broke jail if you will and we're
going to use this through the bro here's
first and then we're going to just fill
in any kind of sparse areas with our
cannot pull meat product so let's go
through the bruise first and that is
kept them a really nice can a regimented
sheet make sure that here's our all
going in the right direction and it's
slightly tented as well good and because
I've been using this product on my brows
that are actually growing in better so
I'm pretty happy with that
actually I'm going with the eye primer
anything I'll do it's quite a nice late
look so it's not to concentrate so it
was not gonna depending on the ice cream
or too much so I'm just going to pop
that all over my lid just to get a nice
even toward and as for eyes our eyes are
going to keep it super late and easy and
natural so this is actually like a
perfect going to school / it going to
work
makeup and if you're not too bothered
about reading too much makeup during the
day because it's so quick so I'm just
going to win with an isolate is a doll
just to mattify that all down and that
just pretty much stays that let make
sure nothing is going to crease so I'm
just going to run with a really
pigmented show any shadow if I can find
my brush and I'm going to go right in to
the inner corner with this we go and
then I'm going to go on to the lid as
well
and then this is a really good tip so if
you are not wearing false lashes if you
are just going to go a bit more natural
if you use a shimmer right down at the
root of the lash when you put your
mascara on your at the blackness and the
thickness of your little mash is all
released and though the mascara I'm
going to use is the scandalize mascara I
think it's one of the rebels most famous
products to be honest and it's just a
really good black mascara and we're
going to use that to build up some nice
thickness to the lash desam mascara is
so good low can you see that see for
someone like our lashes every single day
usually so when I usually just romesco
I feel a bit bold but that is actually
really nice and finish looking I'm going
to go in with a little braid for me just
to thicken up my eyebrows a little bit
just because I'm keeping it super light
on the eyes and the lips so I kind of
want something to be the focus and I
love a nice little private moment so I'm
just going to go ahead with this Paul
need and I'm just going to slightly
thicken up the rose
Nathan we're going to do it as my lip
and we leave my skin my eyes like that
just super flesh it's a pretty easy and
super quick and the lips I'm going to
use is the Kate lipstick and number 40
is just a super lovely hood nice and
light so I'm going to use a liner to
just line my lips first this later nose
once the lips are lined just an egg and
a color if you want it to be a bit more
natural you can use a lip liner that is
closer color to the lipstick I use quite
a dark one but you'll see why in a sec
then it's going to hot ass lipstick on
and when I look it's really big like
this I usually just get my finger and
I'm just going to get the lipstick I
could rub into my lips and into the lip
liner and then just for good measure I
would put tiny little more about
highlight along so I'm just obsessed so
it's weird it looks super light in the
packet but then as soon as you get on
your sponge and then if you are any kind
of oily like me you can use the powder
just to mattify it go in the center and
I don't mean to get oily through the day
and I use this foundation before and I
really like it and I've used it without
powder and it's usually fine so you guys
that is me done and I think this is a
good change from what I usually do my
makeup like I'm keeping it super
efficient easy and simple and then
obviously it using a model which is
really affordable which is great and the
products is still totally do exactly
what you wanted to do so back to this
app what we would do now is we're going
to steal my look so I'm going to use
this mirror just to make sure I can get
my face in here done stole my face try
on my own makeup again actually
well so you guys have seen how easy it
is to steal my looks of what I'm going
to do is I'm going to stay at Paris
Estelle for five seconds so you can
steal my looks all you to do is get your
double ad click here on steal the look
and you put the little box on my face
cool
okay so what you can do if you don't
quite get that pause the video on when I
am building still steal my look and then
see what products that they will say for
you to try so as always I will like
everything that I use down below I'll
see you guys next week with another
