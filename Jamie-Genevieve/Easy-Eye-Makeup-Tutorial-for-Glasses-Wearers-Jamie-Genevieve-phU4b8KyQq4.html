I feel glam and Claver hi guys welcome
back to my channel I had a thought with
different this week there's something
different
hmm of course most of you wouldn't know
that I have indeed especially for days
so I have work laughs sighs since I was
every 12 but I only need them for
computer work thumbs
I say selves I mean watching TV
everything when I was at school I just
have to use them for writing work and
train much every life immediately I'm
editing your videos for you I'm actually
reading these bad boys I have teamed up
with Optical Express and we are bringing
you three tutorials on how to apply eye
makeup general makeup whatever a few
rear glasses contacts and alike all to
express at a massive company the deal
wear glasses they've got shot they've
got like your store week when you get
your eyes tasted and you can pick your
flames with only the wooden brand or get
you for what should a design your
glasses or you can actually get reason
achievement so we've teamed up and I'm
gonna help you guys see the way you get
it to work them for you guys today is I
have come up with
I have a cup tutorial that it's perfect
for everyday wear whether you're like me
and your glasses are coming on and off
join with you or whether your glasses
all day every day and that's eye makeup
Luke is gonna define your eyes it's
gonna give you that drama without being
too heavy or non-existent and it will
last you all the nunc I think that's
like stay tuned okay okay so starting as
always worked an eyeshadow base because
you definitely are going to be needing
that this is it soft ochre by Mac which
is one of their pin paws and I'm just
applying that with his Weaver face shape
brush but I just love how chunky it is
for applying that product you know so
applying out all over up to concealer
underneath the brow and not as much
underneath this team and then I'm going
in why
a Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and my
Viva soft definer brush we're just gonna
use that under the trees
oh I need a mirror I can't see this look
is a lot softer than my usual that is
suitable with or without glasses as well
when it comes to applying your product
make sure you're using quite a generous
amount just loose nice and mark then I'm
gonna go in with eyeshadow ice cream I
make a peak also and again I would say
that this is probably more of a daytime
look
do you have time for me anyway I'm just
going to use that under the brow just
here just to get a nice highlight my
glasses show my eyebrows some of you
will have glasses that are a bit bigger
which it means that you can get away
with not having as perfect brows which
is obviously the name and I'm going to
go in without ice cream shoes and I'm
just going to put a little bit of that
over the lid and now I'm going to do it
the light now so I'm going to use Ella
maskers precision ink and a Beth's which
is a super super black I'm gonna do
reflects it relatively small because my
glass has come to make here anyway so
they would be hidden so starting off
just in the inner corner
and then bringing that flick back down
on itself
and now I'm going to go in with Mack
pencil and fear lane which is my new
absolute favorite pencil I am a woman
obsessed I'm just going to tightline the
whirling so I've colored on the water
line and I'm gonna go above on a really
easy way to do that it's just there
squeeze your eye I'm going to go back in
with my soft brush and we'd go in with
Peach Smoothie just underneath the eye
and then a little bit of vodka which is
this really beautiful chocolatey Brown
personally I'm not massive fan of
reading eyelashes when I'm reading my
glasses usually I would take them off
beforehand or make a point of not
reading eyelashes but what I do like to
do is get a good mascara we're just
going to give me loads of volume a nice
thick black lashes so I've picked the
film noir by nabla which is a relatively
new brand to me but I absolutely love
them an Italian brand you can get it
online and I'm just gonna give my lashes
a couple of coats of this
amazing let's mascara Elise plays me
every time oh good
and now you're ready to disco another
really important thing is to make sure
you let your misguided dry my eyelashes
are quite naturally curly
so I'm by that I mean the curl up the
way so if your eyelashes a bit
straighter I definitely get a with an
eyelash curler and give them a Carlos or
Z point more upwards because if they are
straighter they will flap around in your
glasses which is not ideal so I let that
dry whoa why I got a green this thing
ever and that's the finished look so
easy really simple especially for me
totally always available with no glasses
on Israel or which is great but as you
put your glasses on your eyes I look to
find the are definitely there and it's
quite a classy way to have your own
makeup python thank you so much for
watching this video guys if you liked to
see more licks on how to makeup when you
your glasses or contacts please stay
tuned thank you so much guys I'll see
you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
