I'm gonna go over des look I've got my
eyes just now and I've been cheeky and
recorded all these and one day I'm sure
you know already so if you'd like to see
my browser toriel you can go here and if
you'd like to see my whole video which
I'm wearing this makeup you can look
here alright so this look is really
really simple but it looks quite
glamorous because you've got a better
glitter and obviously Valentine's Day is
coming up we don't balance if you want
bring it on one day if you want really
go to church really good it's good
thank you so much for watching again and
I'll be back next week with another
tutorial thank you guys so starting off
I have trimmed my eye with Mac painterly
paint-pot
I'm using the Ziva rodeo Bale palette so
this is quite a warm Brown it's going to
be the transition shade so I'm putting
it in my crease with my blending brush
by his Weaver and I'm blending that up
towards the brow and under the eye as
well
it's quite a blown-out smokey eye were
doing so don't worry if you blend I'll
be a bit further out than usual and a
nice thing about this look as you can
stop it anytime and it's quite weird a
bowl so you don't need to go as dark as
I have to do that there is a trick I
learned from tres be holding your
blending brush a little bit higher to
blend up towards the brows it just meets
blending and absolute didn't come true
it makes it so much easier making sure
that it really really really blended
gorman with a darker Brown shadow into
the crease just to intensify that a
little bit and again under the lash line
making sure again it's really nice and
blended even the way it was quite a bust
out look I do want it to be quite smooth
look hang
going in with the darkest color in the
palette which is just off black with a
faint sparkle to it which makes it
really easy for blending I am passing
out on just with the same brush all over
at my LEDs and making it nice and dark
and then I'm just gonna start blending
that up towards the Browns that we've
already played in days so if you were to
start off with the dark shades it would
be pretty tough to blame the outboards
just until your concealer or flame-o so
the transition shade really helps going
on with a small smaller brush underneath
the eye with the same black shadow
making sure it's nice and buffed out
this is Illamasqua pencil and Sofie
which is our black pencil and I'm using
that and the water lane and then buffing
that out with the small tube brush again
this is two-faced glitter glue and
placing a little bit on the back of my
hands and using my ring finger just to
Pat a little bit oil in the center of
the eye this is a far better glue I
think it's probably my favor so using
your finger makes it creat diffused as
well this is toilet let out by Elaine
came just using a small brush I'm gonna
dab the glitter on top of the glue just
in the center of the eye the cause of
glasses quit dark and the shadows crepe
back you don't need to worry about your
positioning too much a little bit of
mascara by Illamasqua
just to darken up the lashes top and
bottom Bob and then washed I'm saying
male 3 making sure you do the large
stones it meets the lash nice and packet
so when you go to Pretoria actually
sticks there is nothing worse than a
watery blush it does not work looking
down and motor and placing them on with
tweezers it's probably the easiest way
to put on lashes for me and then just
get the lash and your fingers and it
rule your real lashes between them just
to make sure that they're really secure
a little bit mascara just to finish off
and that is a complete look this is a
really really nice easy simple look that
you can make as dark as you like as bold
as you like or the soft as you like so
it's good for all occasions I hope you
like this so it goes and if you like to
