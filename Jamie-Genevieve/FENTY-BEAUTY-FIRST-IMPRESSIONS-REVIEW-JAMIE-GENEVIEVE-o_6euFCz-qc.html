finally here
oh my god I have here the Finn T
collection so basically this morning I
will cut the quarter past floppin v
Craig the preface on and when to
Edinburgh which is where Harvey Nichols
is which is where the only fancy concert
in Scotland is so I got up got my ass
out of bed got really went through and I
got to see the collection super early I
picked up all the things so basically I
just wanted to get a collection and try
it out this is probably the makeup brand
that I'd be most excited for this year I
feel like everything happened really
quickly they did amazing all they're
kind of press around it and all that
kind of like sneak peeks totally worked
on me like I've even got my Fanny jumper
oh and I'm like I'm hate it's gonna be a
first impression slash review I've
actually never done one of these before
it's so this is the way I'm going to do
it hope you like it but basically yeah
I've got all my face right now and if
you would like to see how I created the
look then please stay tuned
oh my god oh my god I'm so excited
right it's doing skincare first much
disco Chuck I thought this is not what
reviewing but I wouldn't use my Chi
press I was huge give it a fair run you
know and this is the Chi press
antioxidant do I just love that I feel
like when I use it my skin's always
super calm and my friend eknoll actually
well it's like a hydrate and layer
without it being too much but I'm really
excited about this stuff
I just hope a whole and somebody's and I
really hope it's like my new favorite
foundation because I'm actually not
hired the foundation that I've been
obsessed with lately like I've just been
mixing laws together and it has been
good but I want something amazing
I'm just taking my kills daily reviving
concentrate and that is my skin ready so
obviously I've got mascara lashes and
brows on already
because fainty doesn't have a full range
of products like ten
there's no eye shadows and all eyes on
products and technically there's no like
lipsticks or anything like that so I
bought bunches I bought a lot of
stuff I went through it to the lane this
morning I got gifted two things metal
moon and this stick chili mango like the
phones that really excite about so I'll
gifted these two and then I bought the
rest this stuff it came to just under
200 pounds but I got a lot of stuff like
the foundations only 26 pounds which is
totally fine I'm winning my fainty
jumper to celebrate the occasion
I'm just gonna go through I'm not trying
to any of this stuff though other than
on the back of my hand I don't know if
my foundations gonna match me I don't I
don't know but we're gonna make it
working right before first thing we're
gonna try as the st. T beauty by Rihanna
soft matte pro filter and instant
retouch primer love the package n really
really cool really cool chic packaging
lovely brands and the coder literally
killers will absolutely love their
packaging of the products like the
component and I'm going to use this in
the scent or mo see it's super creamy
it's not like one of those silicone
primers like one of the girls on the
counter I said that she had this on and
she's got dry skin and it was still
gorgeous or as mad someone they're gonna
use this and I said in my face smells
nice gentle it's not too fragrance feels
great on as well it's not slave D or
anything like that it's not too oily
obviously it's a matte primer so yeah
I'm just liking it smoothing out my skin
yeah I like this I like this I can tell
you this to me usually I think because I
used so many makeup products I can kind
of tell if I like something away
and I do like this so that's good
can't member here much as I think it's
26 pages are really 21 pounds someone
said that they base the prices of Mac
which is amazing I honestly thought it's
going to be more
not obviously it is really she can
charge whatever she wants
first impressions that's nice offices
trainers we don't know until we've worn
all day foundation profile our soft
matte long wear foundation I picked the
shade tuning tea if you don't know you
have to shake this by the way you have
to really sheet but she said because
it's so pigmented and apparently throw
and said you only need one pump but I
like a lot of foundations we'll see no
no I don't think this cars gonna be okay
we'll make it work
maybe just one pump for this then but
what I'm really intrigued about is all
this makeup is all of its skin and ghoul
there's no bronzer so to speak there's
no problem sir there's contours which
I've got yes I go that's what the
concealer says like a concealer culture
I'm getting ahead of myself
so really the foundation first there's
forty shades forty shades everyone's
really excited because it's gonna
hopefully match everybody
oh let's finish maybe okay I'm gonna
take three pumps I don't think what
pumps gonna do it I'm gonna use my
Beauty play inside they do have brushes
paint you have come out with brushes yes
got a match mmm matches its look it
looks a little bit dull on me this color
both see though and yeah there's forty
shades everyone's really excited right
because it looks like everyone's skin
until it's going to be cared for over
month notice this is a matte foundation
there she's kind of crazy for me but I'm
excited and someone else is here and one
of the girls on Kiner
say that they will be coming out with
loot or stuff but they basically wanted
to start off with everyone's favorite
for Indian they want it to be everyone's
favorite foundation for coins and they
say this and they're totally right when
you love a foundation you will go back
and you will get that foundation forever
yeah I was right it's a wee bit greedy
for me but I know that I'll be worn out
the undertones look amazing their loads
they're like peachy undertones but then
at the same time Ursula to like warm
undertones all undertones pink
undertones
like everything maybe should have got a
couple of the foundations don't think
didn't think oh wait I use three pumps I
feel like the pump screech small 32
metal and a ball of 26 quits
I just took about a couple of pumps
there it does dry down okay
cuz I tried nothing back in my hand like
look you can see we put inflation that
on and it's going darker cuz see what
it's gone dark hurts perfect
I'm so glad so yeah it doesn't dry tone
I said oxidize and someone said what's a
dry down and what I would do is I maybe
wait and watch people on YouTube use it
what I wouldn't do is maybe buy it
online and if you don't know your shades
and told us is going to color chart
I'll actually just got home from the
open end and I'm just talking it on
quite like this oh do you know what
would be a good tail I'm gonna go and
try on wedding dresses today and Kara
and shower that are gonna be there and
there will know as they say they think
my skin looks good on Lois goods
basically okay so I'm gonna use maybe a
bit four pumps for my whole face using a
Beauty Blender they did launch brushes
and they do have their own type of
sponge as well they look great then pick
any other mop cuz I didn't want to buy
the whole collection because I saw that
man of God planted wedding dress tonight
so I'm just gonna add in this last look
back coverage I feel like is good
coverage though yeah it's definitely
better bow this have a little close-up
grace it's covered every third night but
you can still see my skin it's mint it
be a matte foundation I do definitely
think my skin looks matter than usual
but I have somewhat a glow in my skin
new that's the oil zoom you can see the
texture see I think that looks really
nice color wise like good okay we yep
like that like that let me tell you to
see how it wears and Jack's gonna
literally edit this video and get up ACP
so if you are literally watching this go
and check mate my time and I will update
you guys on how it's more so next thing
we've got these are called the match
sticks matte skin stick
and this package and this is my favorite
right however it means is that as they
got six hexagons
that's right these these are for
contouring highlighting concealing these
are like the concealers and it come just
like this and you rule up
that's so much product to get it must go
down a little bit - not as much product
stuff what you would get like look at
the size of that I thought maybe it
would be good down a little bit more but
you never know maybe you don't need much
over maybe it's worth it how many grams
seven point one seven seven point one
grams of product I don't know if that's
good at all see that has got dark I do
you think so
feels good doesn't feel tight it feels
more mad than I'm used to but I like it
okay contouring oh okay
so you can feel the matte foundation
when you're putting these on and this is
the shade mocha and honestly I don't
really cream contour that much but it's
kind of the only bronzing product they
had so I had to try it
you know no I don't think I'm not very
good at it whew it does feel nice it's
not as a creamy and I thought it would
be but that may not be a bad thing
because if it was any creamier today I
could really run out really quickly and
at least yes magnetized curly right I'm
gonna blend that out first and then do
my highlight and so don't really like
doing it the same thing so I'm gonna
take my Beauty Blender
I'm feeling pretty good about that so
far I like the way my skin looks are
blended really easy and that has a nice
color for quantitated for me take a look
like Rihanna new snatch - Gianna oh I
like the way my forehead look head cuz
that can look sometimes that can look
really oily and quick easy sometimes
before a paradigm that's look quite good
realize your little by highlighting so
the color go for that
was bamboo hmm and it's also the
concealer the only thing I would say is
this is quaint Bank and it made me
quickly me I might just try it and it
looks the same like I've just applied my
highlight of my coins here and they both
look the same they both look d'orléans
like I've got a lot of product on with
this yeah I feel like a follow up
product on but the shape of their actual
products not changed which is good for
me like I saw for example the chemical
dieting ones if you were to use there's
much product you don't like nearly right
oh I know but I haven't actually tried
those funny though I do i do see
similarities and like the packaging and
stuff like that but i do i'm not held it
before but this package packaging feels
better it sweetens it feels like your
money like it feels like how much you've
spent on it as what you've got and like
the friend a sheen is like in a glass
frosted glass tube it's nice it's white
so it's looking dirty already but that
doesn't actually really bother me I do
feel like my skin's a wee bit more matte
than normal but I can expect that but I
like a little bit more creaminess when
I'm blended just taste a wee bit longer
who knows though maybe would be worth it
the last night that's landed nice I like
that and obviously a few like I think
what could really work well with this is
my level check for a drop oil on my face
and then blend I think that would be
amazing
I don't want to do it just in case it
made the foundation react badly there's
a couple of foundations I've tried it
with and it's like but I like that
greatness under my eyes I leave my
coverage I like the soft softcore clear
know that I've done my highlight and I
do feel like it's maybe we touch peel
nextreports try is the matchsticks
shimmer skin stick now this color looks
so amazing but
Oh talk to him off there oh there's a we
sponge at the top to stop it from
getting damaged which is actually quite
cool but I can't get it back in here is
the skin stick so that's like that it's
like pretty bright orange but someone
said you could use it as a blush so I
feel like if I don't this strategically
no so just just cream products or Foe
okay I'm gonna try and blend that out
nice I do feel too appealable so what
I'm going to do is we would have
finished off my face using the saintly
product this is how I highlight my
contour my blush all in one but another
thing you can use the chili mango thing
for is like your eyes I don't think they
say that you can use it on your eyes but
I would do it anyway to be honest
they're good for 12 months as well just
pretty good for a spec for in - Ernesto
right next thing we've got as the
universal blotting powder Lake this
packaging as well
really cool I just like everything about
I think it's sheep and this when I first
saw it remainded me of the came in a
corn powder not actually tried that it
comes with a little sponge that you can
use to block either tend to use these
too much but I actually don't tend to
powder that much so looking at my skin
not actually shoot I would painted it
but I need to try it so and someone was
saying that this is because Rihanna
stick of the crazy flashback and using
powder under her eyes and it being far
too like white for her and things like
that so that's why she made this
Universal one I'm gonna use this under
my eyes my eyes looking a wee bit creepy
and I had to Herson it I love that I'll
show you my skin and cool stuff at the
end
Ballack in the mirror oh it says here
Fanta Beauty which i think is quite cute
I like the detail here okay I'm feeling
good good I feel very natural which i
think is what it all about
and jam rolls so I think I should maybe
like just get used to that but I do feel
like I want to bronze because they don't
have any bronzers they've got the phone
obviously I don't know what's on there
but this is going a little bit muddy
here man I'm gonna try and just bronze
up my face I'm just gonna use my Mac
dark tan notes not have any Sun please
give me son and I'm gonna see how this
bronze is on top because they don't have
any bronzers yet but the Dead has more
of that matchsticks concealer highlight
our contour specs that may have been a
better tone for me I think I was deliver
ashy I think I'm of you to warm toned
for it what I like to be to move one two
and now I feel about there I know that
I've got bronzer on I don't think that
was anything to do with actual makeup
there's a muddy little section is still
looking a bit muddy but I'd want to
believe on the products I do like the
most exciting thing for me was
definitely older highlighting powders I
got three different ones the packaging
is sorted man like it's not gonna that
package in the cardboards it protects it
does a good job I don't think any of
them will be smashed or anything so
we've got an orc to go on here and this
is the same tire buta Han Keller war
highlighter and lightning dust and
crystal fire and it's got the amazing
thing you've ue placed in there and then
again we've got Fanny beauty on the
mirror I do like the packaging and it is
weighted I'm gonna get my brush I'm
gonna clean it off and in here you've
got the more subtle side for
highlighting which I can almost
guarantee I will not be using so that's
kind of annoying but like see this one
yep I'm going to use the more sparkly
one
that's good it's all about the skin and
the glow I think like that is absolutely
gorgeous super wet lookin it's nice and
finely milled there's no crazy chunky
glares I wish that it was just that one
for the whole thing well I should try
the more matte one but it does look like
a matte highlight spell nice they values
at my nose yeah it's pretty
I definitely do prefer the other one
though so lovely so I'm gonna use that
on my temples as well nice okay and then
I have another one here call metal moon
same packaging it's really cute it's
white but it's got I cannot ever decent
shine to it a lot of white package and
it's gonna get really dirty again I do
not mind but I may say I don't know if
you can see but this is like the whole
pan and it's got the same beauty local
press and the oh that's actually pretty
it's like a yellowy gold not that Remini
like it's not that sparkly but it does
have a sheen to it it's pretty but I
know the one that everyone wants to see
including me
trophy wife so this is the one that's
got the under net kind of gone and a bit
of a meltdown
yeah actually can't open this oh no oh

so I can open it and my nail just went
right and that's really upsetting
I've tried pushing it back I can but I
just got loads of product oh that's so
good and so it's not that easy to open
but that's funny that's me for having
nails this is the thing that everyone's
gone crazy for it is a super gold gold
gold highlight it's crazy but we're
going to use a tiny bit of it
I see tiny we'll see I think this is
doing they're gonna be the most gorgeous
on disc
tones but I'm going to try it remain
anyway you grab a little bit of it oh
okay it's actually nice as something
like Google though as pigmented enough
that you definitely use it on your eyes
as well I feel like you could do I
really cool him editorial makeup look
with this on the body or something like
that it's accurate okay it's actually a
lot more readable than I thought ever be
I'm gonna try this in the inner corner
desk oh yeah I want a smoky visible oh I
just feel like my skin looks super
healthy a nice I want to spray it with
something I really want to spray it with
something hydrate and but I think that
just me used to nor a matte so indeed
Shane what are you guys saying what do
you think my skin looks like you like it
obviously I never wear matte anything or
it's definitely new to me I do like home
my skin looks you can definitely see
where the highlighter is not all over my
face like usual in last product I've got
as gloss balm Universal look illuminator
and I was Shh shocked I was really
shocked that she only came out with one
lip product there's no other lip
products obviously you can use other
products when your lips like all the
sticks like the chili bamboo wine
there's tons of colors of these you
could use them on your lips don't know
if they're your man too but like yeah
look that's kind of cute like I like
that the Igor there's a lot of color
it's actually really cute super natural
fit it's quite natural makeup though
apart from the foundation which I feel
is heavy coverage I meant I felt up is
definitely making it feel coverage but I
am so glad that I could build it up you
know all my little butt concealer again
just cause that's what I do and yeah so
this is made to look gorgeous on every
single skin tone so if you've seen her
campaign but it wasn't stuff like that
you would have seen tons of models all
different kind towards
they would all
in this applicator was like a big old
door fit that's the color there
let's give it a swatch that's it here
actually quite pink for me but I trust I
trust the process Rihanna mmm smells
good oh this is such a definite loop for
me but that's that that's oh is it yeah
that's all the stuff I got what I'm
gonna do and I'm not going to give it
this whole review thing usually I get
things like two months late but I got up
swirling a wink all this just so I can
film it so I hope you liked it and what
I'm going to do before I wrap up is I'm
gonna put all the products that I used
the names of where you guys can get them
and the prices down below in the
description box what are my thoughts let
me just finish my face first because I
don't feel finished I feel like I need a
little bit more coins through so I'm
just gonna take a little bit of a cap
onesie and just close any just buddies
I'm gonna take my own name alright we're
just gonna let that sit alright I'm just
actually fixing my face I didn't I'm a
little freer car and some more bought
mascara I'm gonna show you guys a super
close-up look on my skin so this is what
my skin looks like so you guys that is
matte final look and I use all the fancy
products that I bought the two that I
was gifted as well and final thoughts
are I'm very excited I'm really excited
to see what else she comes up with and
if there are things that I think that
you should definitely try I'm really
excited about the primer in the
foundation because my skin I still feel
looks pretty luminous like all my
highlighting and stuff I'm excited to
see how it wears throughout the day
because obviously I usually used super
juice
additions and daughterly powder them
doing that much till using mattifying
products for me is exciting but scary
let's give it first there was no choice
but to try them out saying there was no
dewy foundation or do primer anything
like that yes
who knows maybe it'll be my favorite
thing I don't know I'm really exciting
to see how it wears and then I will be
tweeting all of it my makeup today so I
feel like it's looking good while the
black I'm gonna take some fours
I'm gonna take some flash before it was
as well and sex I'm up on sweatshirt
which is Jimmy underscore Genevieve Ames
you can check that I the highlight this
one here it's called kalabaw which I
think brilliant but the lightning dust
and fire crystal do for me I think that
is the latest deal they do go way deep
which look absolutely gorgeous but I
just know that I wouldn't be able to use
them on my skin tone apart from on my
eyes so this one here so excited about
this I think that looked gorgeous and
trophy rice I am shocked at how it looks
on my cheeks because I'm excited that
I'll be able to use it when I bought it
I don't think it's gonna be quite
gimmicky on my inner corner here is
looking quite yellow gold which I don't
tend to do I'm gonna get my gold today
probably not my favorite thing in the
world but I do like the way it's made my
skin like obviously I have not seen any
other videos on these products or there
people may have a really different
experience i well see I have very easy
skin for foundations and primers
most things will look okay or good and
actually have it weird that is how I'm
gonna be able to tell if I like her or
not but first impressions are very
exciting love the brown 10 and yeah if
there's something that I definitely
think you should maybe try out that
highlighter the lip gloss you can't
really go wrong with it suits everybody
it's nice one thing if I could go back
and look North by something it would
probably be the concealer part like the
concealer and the contour just because I
don't like cream contour that much it's
a bit of a faff for me under my eyes
looks okay but I do prefer the way it
looks with my usual concealer powder
super-friendly melt away yet again don't
really know if it's good or not until
later on in the day but I just wanted to
get this video done and up because I'm
to be grown-up adult youtuber really
hope you liked this video I hope you're
excited let me know down in the comments
below what you think how'd you think my
makeup looks do you like it do you like
the way my skin looks look in the
viewfinder I actually really do like the
way my skin looks it's different from me
it's a little bit more sat and a little
bit more matte and I do actually think
it makes me look less oily people do say
look oily sometimes I'm not saying I
don't like that cuz I do but I'm excited
to see how I like my skin like that's
and how it wears as well are you shocked
at what she brought are you sure that
there's no eye shadows are you sure that
there's no like mascara like jumping so
basic like mascara or lashes or anything
like that let me know in the comments
below
it starts gushing everyone already I
would really love it if you subscribe
and join my family because he has the
nicest time here on YouTube and yeah
apart from that I will see you in the
next video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
