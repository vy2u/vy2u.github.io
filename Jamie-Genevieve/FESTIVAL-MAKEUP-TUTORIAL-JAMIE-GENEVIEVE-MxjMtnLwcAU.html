I'm going to show you how to do that
Coachella inspired me cup every guys and
all I was at Coachella playing with
three weeks ago no it was amazing the
first weekend I went with the brand
kills from the UK and in the second
weekend I was there with next few eggs
and we had the most fun the most fun it
was awesome it was such a good time but
my favorite part of the festival was
definitely getting rid doing my makeup
get excited being more creative with my
makeup as well so this was the first
look that I desk when I was out first of
all this is the first look I posted onto
Instagram and you guys seemed to really
care so thank you so much for all the
love on this look I decided that I was
going to recreate it for you when I got
home so keep watching if you would like
to see how I created this look I hope
you guys liked it I love this little
naked baby okay
I've already done my eyebrows and risk a
jump into the makeup so the pressure
that I'm working off of as Michael
Taylor inspired makeup this is on my
Instagram and this is probably the most
requested look
there was one hour look that I really
loved and I had I cannot had dual piece
that was from the Gypsy train Cece Clark
she's and other influences from Donen
England she's great she actually gave me
a little can I had Jill's thing but
obviously at love gone it's lost is lost
in the Coachella abyss
I'm just going to get started the main
thing about this look is actually
readable apart from the kind of white
accent details that I'll do so I'm going
to the fill makeup and then we'll do the
kind of more accessible that ask so I've
already done my eyebrows I use actually
this is a new product for me I use the
brighter the sweet fiber pan cells from
Rimmel I got this in the meal couple of
years ago and it's really really good
actually so I'll use that first then my
row beater from urban decay and dark
zone and then I set my brows within
gimme brows and the kids to me which is
like a maze can a dark road jail and
then I went
it and carved I propose using the Tarte
ship Cape so rid your eyes first wrongly
to the total my advice and when I was
traveling the only neutral shadows I
took where the melt cosmetics shadows so
these are better than a few stacks put
together but by far my favorite stack is
the rest's tactical and we'll go and
receive shade blur and my Mac suited for
and I'm just going to go all over and
modify my base which as Lynn law people
then I'm going to go and mostly shade
unseen this is much loved by me
obviously you can tell and we're just
going to build up the creat a little bit
again using the Mac suited for it I just
saw it create and get ready for first of
all being home so I'm just a match about
a little bit glare on my eyelid
don't know how that happened but we're
just going to work with it I'm just
using at the usual motions Wendel cannot
wait for movement usual Mac you too for
keeping a brush nation high to help
blend up towards the globe I'm going to
zoom in a little bit so I'm still just
using the shade I'm seeing the male
shadows are honestly they're definitely
one of our favorite eyeshadow formulas
they're just so blendable and beautiful
I just love them but I'm actually going
to switch out though so once I've got
that kind of base on I'm going to switch
out and use some Urban Decay shadows so
these are relatively new to me these are
to initiate our urban decay eyeshadow
they are stunning so I've got the shade
ray left here and spiked
so got a nice orange and making a rig
and we will end with the Sheep spiked
first and the same brush the market
afford and we're just going to start
adding that into the trees you can see
that warmth straightaway these shadows
are really beautifully pigmented as well
as this shadow the same formula same
browsers are indicate but it was the
same size as the mail birthday again
we're just doing the same movements on
top sorry if you guys can kind of notice
my life my teeth aren't nearly straight
I can't believe it it's been so quiet
but my brain says I might have to get
them all for three days today as would
so we're nearly done guys were nearly
done I wish I could see that that's the
reason my accents were difficult to
understand but it's really not
I'm having some heart palpitations today
man I'm not used to coffee anymore I'm
not used to wake up this early get loud
got me got me feeling a certain type of
way and then when I get designed outside
why i i'm just using the side of the
brush careful and and that oh now I'm
going to go end of the species relish
relish and we're just going to use the
same brush the max or two for or we're
just going to concentrate that shadow
more enter the crease and honestly a
little teeny tiny bit onto the lid and
the good thing about this because
there's no liner involved so it's
actually super quick and after I'm
finished doing this tutorial I already
know that I'm just going to take the dot
we can equate accents off and just we're
at this makeup stick so I love these
colors they were so pretty and then I'm
going to go n Wesley shade below and am
actually can use sim brush get multiple
men order product and we're just going
to go all over our little legs and we're
just going to mattify that rate down so
not only is there's a confessional
makeup but this is tried and tested by
me and it lasts all day even in a horse
run so the mascara that I used when I
was we was the push-up angel by
Maybelline I you said the entire time I
was away and I have to say I will be
repurchasing this when I run out is
amazing I remembered I used this
individual and at first I was like like
her should be depressions but this
amazing it's really good so we're just
going to start building up those lashes
on the top I think the reason I like it
so much as a crumble and when it dries a
drive and it's not going anywhere
it's just a reason you I mean just that
just five simple easy I'm going to glue
up these lashes these are a little old
ones but they are the lowly lashes and
the style can
going to glue these up that is the is
beauty my glue fine glue and it's the
same as the deal with that I love the
one words are going to blues you to it
wrong with the green rating good eyelash
glue super important especially if
you're going to be ruined army public
for 12 hours and seventy plus degrees
Celsius you need to lashes to stay on
one point we're waiting for our last to
die I'm going to spec one of the seelye
devising contantly oil from Kiehl's you
guys original I love it
I'm putting on a bit five drops I've
already moisturized using my skin
Iceland
I'm just a pattern hydration is key when
I was in the desert I was using an SPF
underneath my makeup I don't have to do
any flash photography when I was over
there it I don't know if there was any
flash back but because we are at home
I'm not really using a happy so the
moisturizer that I use as the clothes
team the pure clay team by skin Iceland
get it in copy it or M&amp;amp;A it's my
favorite I love it I just got a new one
because I ran it yeah I bought between
that and kills moisturizer so I've
already put that on timber oil on and
the foundation I'm going to use to be I
have spoke about quite a lot on Twitter
and my supportable video but as the
Natasha and one arts foundation X
foundation I use this every day when I
was at KU Taylor I used everything rosin
daily till stop and as long as your skin
as well hydrated
a exfoliated as well this foundation is
bomb
so my extend tape is kind of combination
oily I get always blemish obviously but
yet you'll see you'll see this in action
in an hour what's a key all of it I'm
just going to quickly stick my lashes on
I love lashes
I agree them every day and are more
these so many times and are so fab the
only drama in my life the size of my
lashes I'm so excited I hopefully before
a properly like stick them all in there
now that we're all pricked let's just
some foundation
my beauty blender and I'm just going to
put to come to this on the back of my
hand and I'll show you guys how it plays
a little rain so the shade ages is
number 42 which is medium it was perfect
for me when I had a little bit of feet
times the Lord I've got a little bit of
a tan from being away so it's still good
but as a super year with one foundation
which I actually really like I don't
mind that it's a little bit more fuel
than I am because as you look at my
shoulders this is my natural talent and
woman it's still a bit later could have
cool oh great over there great red bad
boys and I'm just beautiful and and
that's on you can see that as a really
good coverage I like to bring it down my
neck and feel coverage it's definitely
no art film art foundation but it's more
mad than for examples it's hardly
interested to see more mad than the Born
This Way Foundation but it's not a
filmer on me anyway maybe that's because
I use my oils underneath I don't like to
film a presentation not massive makes my
skin look old old guy look at that two
seconds you've got beautiful coverage
and my powders gone really really well
on top which is really important for me
because I don't powder my entire face as
I was cute
Pyro's on top of our unset foundation
and it went or cakey I would be able to
do that because I refused program entire
face I just looks so bad on me
so no intro so underneath a nice cheap
cape
I'm actually using she'd medium at the
moment which is not actually that like
I'm just don't know on I like to use a
mesentery roads as well and my problem
area is actually the movement mostly
just right here so I like to use better
concealer there and we're just going to
blend that into another thing I was
doing when I was away when I had even
more of a tan so this is actually a bit
peel which I was using the hourglass
foundation the
stick and then using this just a little
bit of that and then you can let people
in and and that was the best coverage
over only the that couple of days that s
the same I just use a space field that
is there some full coverage fabulousness
so to say it my makeup I'm actually
going to use and this is quite new to me
I'm not talked about on YouTube before
by been using it every day I use the
pure for and one place my little makeup
and late pan so it's a little touch
lighter than my skin tone but it does
actually match me pretty nicely and when
you use the Kat Von D shade + light
brush we're going to use the shoot part
and we're just going to sweep that
underneath eyes to say and then I like
to use this on my smile lines doing the
same to my Lords as well just to kind of
centrally other support and I like to
use it on my forehead and I was doing
that every day when I was away and I
don't know for that that might be a
contributor as the final make it was
less than I'll do my let's finish our
eyes and then just to quickly finish off
my eye makeup I'm going to go in with
the cheese spike and just a cat smaller
brush I'm going to use this mess - it's
very brush I'm just going to draw
underneath my lash line and smoke that
out and nice to see that this eye shadow
would look unreal
on every eye color especially the blue
and green brain it was kind of more
compliment but you've got blue green
eyes the familiarised pork so much and
I'm just laying that out a little bit
more it with my Charlotte Tilbury eye
blender brush that's it's the nicest
warm smoky eye out of my diary and then
I'm going to going with a tiny touch of
the relish color and just pull and the
kind of outside of my eye just do get a
lot with more dimension and then always
like to do is to build up the bottom
lashes I'm going to use the push-up
angel mascara by Maybelline maybe you
really believe and that makes the whole
cannot enjoy with darker with like
adding shadow
I feel like that subscribers got bear as
it's got older it's going to clump here
so it's just like it's a current little
annual perfect so that if I have a
conservative mindset love and money and
now we're going to go in and this is my
new favorite brush for this we're going
to end with Matt give me son
not director I will pick this up just
before a went away and it's just a
little bit more warm toned I think the
art time is a dark but it could almost
look a little bit dark pink so listen a
wee bit more can ask Warren toward I
wanna see orange Bedouin see orange
we're going to use the Charlotte Tilbury
powder and sculpt brush and this is my
favorite brush for starting to build up
corn cereal we're going to start adding
all the time and when I was doing this
liquid all the way I did a super quarter
by that I mean that was really really
bronze and just starting at the top of
the ear like usual worked my way down to
the corner of the mouth using small
movements and making sure I'm really
buffing that into the foundation because
I'm not putting the beast and then I'm
going to use a little bit very much all
and then the forehead forehead is
important so I cannot go ready to put
them around my hairline and then
actually bring the bones are quite far
down this plane just cuz I want to be I
want to be the most bronze I've ever
been in my entire life okay
give me the space to be that person and
integral too much you get your little
powder brush from earlier and you just
little circular movements you can above
that back and then I'm going to go ahead
with my morphe BM portal to brush it has
my favorite bronzer brush and it's going
to go light sweet all over I still just
kind of solve it from being a tart and
always going to bronze up the entire
face and I love using this brush for
going down my neck now I'm going to go
in with the Bahama Mama bronzer and this
is such an amazing contour shade it's a
really deep ash brain and you Cal it'll
touching this onto my Charlotte Tilbury
brush just to build up that quanta a
little bit more and then I'm actually
going to go in with that brush and that
color and I'm going to snatch my nose
just a little just one times
a little bit and it's not actually that
noticeable and you're like at all on
pictures and on film it looks and makes
a big difference
no a bizarre story when I was away my
vehicle pal smashed smashed on the
bathroom floor instead time where I
worked on Coachella
I would delighted to find a little
parcel from milk cosmetics with your new
digital dust highlighters in there so
this is stargazer which is beautiful
I'm wondering if maybe as you try the
golden one to become in a really
beautiful book the packaging for this is
actually just so beautiful and I'm
actually going to mix to them to get
exam a bit more time today I'm going to
use a little bit Holden or and a little
bit of stargazer we're going to
highlight this isn't over faces so the
brush I'm going to use is the morphe are
three I was quite a delivery of more
free stuff yesterday and I'm really
intrigued to see her like the highlight
brush is good and I'm going to put in a
little bit of golden aura oh my god
these are slit enemies and highlighter
and I'm salt ready two girls from Mill I
wish it has these four going away oh my
some are just mixing those two together
as you guys are thinking that you really
want to get one star gazer from my skin
tone and later would be lovely
and then golden or from my skin tone and
darker it'd be lovely because I can get
away with using both if you are any
feeders than I am then I think it may be
a little bit too golden aonian for the
center of my face I'm just going to use
a stargazer
with a little eye shadow brush I'm gonna
do my Cupid's bow and ten men dispersed
over a nose you're really constraining
and then what I like to do is describe
my bronzer brush and just blend that
into my pointer a little bit and then of
acid is going to send especially cold
for a kind of Morton natural is the
wrong
more looking at evening makeup with both
kind of physical parts I'm going to use
my Kat Von D Barone and it's called Mad
Max Brown just to fill in my little
friend curl better and then I totally
forgot to highlight my recorder when you
use stargazer for mail again obvious I'm
going to do in the little noodle it must
be whip I'm going to use the Urban Decay
wire lip liner and the part reinforce
lipstick and skinny bit favorite I love
it for a lipstick in so long last and
it's super an audition
it doesn't actually give you that crazy
life because it's still kind of creamy
it just blends really nicely and you
need to worry about looking like maniacs
Creole red and once you find your lip
liner again I just use the liar lip
liner by Arvind I've started actually
giving myself a Cupid's bow again and
I'm just going to fire at this lipstick
on and blend right over the lip liner
and then I'm going to finger blend in
and that is the ultimate knit what I
 love it it's my favorite color
it's not the kind of news that makes
your teeth look yellow it's just like my
life it's perfect if I could make
lipstick I would not be that far
although honestly I think it's so
perfect and it's the creamiest to smell
good
so it's really much which I actually
like I think that's fine I'm not really
buying a lipstick for it to smell
hommies and you know at this point I'm
going to actually save my makeup and I'm
using the OL nitro from Urban Decay love
their stuff it's completely anti over is
not under it at all actually people love
it it's worth the hype thanks Lee I love
the new packaging
I think the urban have changed up a
package and lately on they're in a
makeup crate and they've got new
products that can help keep your makeup
off and stuff I think it's just really
cover I love what they've done so Vettes
bra
I set my entire face I'm going to go in
with a little touch more powder just my
smile lines
my chen i'm a forehead county what'd you
find 42nd beg me use a little bit more
tighter i think it actually looks basic
i don't think it kind of oily as before
parts of money to proto right there i
can see i can see you right here i think
it made from the grievant more
airbrushed not look airbrushed but you
know what I mean
good so as you're not going to face well
if you're just checking about and you
want to look like a summer princess stop
right here but we're not finished this
is actually is going to take me two
minutes to meet this interface for
makeup you know that so all you need and
this is my favorite product for this is
the next white liquid liner and we're
going to just do some accents onto our
makeup to make a little bit more boho
like I showed you in the full it's
literally it just I'm just going to do
it it's going to do it not gonna be
nervous so the first thing is a little
line on your lip so it's up to you I
actually have another lipstick here that
was going to show you guys so this is my
favorite lipstick at the moment but if
you wanted something that's a little bit
more long-lasting and a little bit more
matte then I highly recommend it the
tart liquid lip and soul tips I'll do a
little swatch comparison these are my
two favorite lip products so if I show
you this right here and skinny debtless
swag go on and investors salty the matte
lip pimp
so they're both slightly similar they're
both really needs for me those are my
two favorite lip products I'm going to
stick with a lipstick at the moment and
we'll get my weight leaner and we're
going to do a little lines on the left
so I have a purist own so I'm just going
to go from the piercing to the PSA if
you don't have a PSA you can draw the
line the still weird on your life or
what you can do is you can buy a fake
lip bag you can get and pretty much
everywhere Amazon eBay and I've not
bought one because it wouldn't expect me
anyway because of this piercing but they
do look really cute it look really real
and all the girls that were red in them
so that they look they felt really
comfortable so I'm just going to use
this we've got a lane it looks cute as
anything and you can't deny it the next
I'm going to do is I'm going to little
dot along the top of my nose they're
really easy especially we've got product
like this you'll actually just thought
oh oh oh man I'm really nervous than
yesterday
I've done five little ones and I'm going
to do more along the top
maybe I voted for this makeup see and
I'll just be really careful okay
and then when we've got the dollar so
and you can kind of go back over them
and perfect them if you to pick someone
we know a little bit more seeded and
then the last thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to do it two lanes across my
nose
so the way I do is I just kind of do a
little door where I want the legs to be
and then I'm just going to go either way
so I get a nice thin tapered Lane
I'm going to I make the top lane a
little bit longer in sucker
cool and then the last I'm going to do
as a line during the middle of my
forehead
Wow posted oh I'm going to get my little
ankle crest I used for concealer in my
brows and I'm just going to try and tidy
up a little bit
that is what's incapable I'm not doing
it again
three days in that happening you know I
actually don't mind it's a bit messy no
disrespect okay most important thing is
it's 10:00 in the middle okay and as ten
meadows and then when I was away
