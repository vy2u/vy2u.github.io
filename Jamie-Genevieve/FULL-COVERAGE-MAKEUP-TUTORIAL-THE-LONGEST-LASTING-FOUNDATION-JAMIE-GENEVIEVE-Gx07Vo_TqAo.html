I'm gonna show you how to create this
entire look I am using a bunch of urban
decay products urban decay reached out
to me and asked if I wanted to put the
old mayor products to the test now you
guys know that I am obsessed with this
product right here this is the all-night
your Saints pretty but I'm also going to
be using the foundation and the
concealer I filmed the campaign for the
concealer ages ago in the foundation I
haven't used a bunch but I'm not sure
why because I think it looks absolutely
amazing so I'm also gonna be showing you
guys the new Born to Run palette if you
would like to see what I think then make
sure you watch the video as well as the
film makeup tutorial I'm also going to
be doing a chicken to see exactly how
long this makeup is gonna last so super
excited team of Urban Decay again and if
you guys would like to see how I created
this look then please teach it yeah okay
first things first is skin and we're
gonna use the Kiehl's
glow formula skin hydrator I know this
is a really gorgeous moisturizer it's
got a lot bit of a 10 in it but I love
using this underneath matte fill
coverage foundation because it just
makes them a little bit more skin like
plus it makes your skin glow and it
skills which means it's good for your
skin because all stuff is next we are
going to take the Urban Decay all
nighter foundation this is in the shade
6.0 which is pretty yellow in tan but I
am quite yellow in tan right now my face
is always later and Pinker I do not know
why sabotage and I'm just gonna bust
that in with a brush when you are
picking out this foundation just be
aware that it oxidizes a little bit so
when you realize that and you get the
right shade is absolutely amazing for
staying power and it looks unbelievable
in photography so nice so I'm just gonna
buff that and all over it with a brush
you can see the coverage heard and then
with this foundation because it does
oxidize a tiny there I'm gonna bring
that down my neck and then onto just
this part of my ear the only problem I'm
having with my skin right now it is my
stupid forehead so I'm gonna cover
for those blemishes but this foundation
does such a good job of covering and
it's definitely the longest lasting
foundation I've ever trays so I only did
two pumps and I've still got a bunch
left in the back of my hand and you can
see the coverage over my tattoo it's
clear so if you're looking for a really
full coverage foundation then bulk of it
a try for a concealer I'm going to use
the only two concealer to match the
foundation this is the shade medium
light neutral and I'm just gonna
highlight all the usual areas
I actually was in Newport Beach which is
where his office of Urban Decay's and I
filmed with this concealer before it
came out as me finally getting my hands
on it
that's concealer as unbelievable the
steam power is crazy and it looks so
good underneath your eyes so if you've
got dark circles this is the one that's
all good it blends really nicely into
the foundation now that's all blended in
I'm actually going to go ahead and put
the concealer over my lid as an
eyeshadow primer
I don't just blend that in with my
foundation brush as well
now before we set with powder a little
trick I like to use as the all nighter
setting spray from urban as well and
spray in your face when you've just got
your cream products onto your foundation
and your concealer and then we set with
powder and it just means it's not gonna
move now you can see that I am soaking
of what I like to do just lay that dry
in now I'm gonna take my Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish powder
and we're just gonna pray down under our
eyes and our eyelids in that set
as you can see that coverage is so good
now it's a bronze the skin for this kind
of long-lasting summer skin tutorial I
really like to use a cream product first
just because it gives the skin that
really gorgeous finish and then to say
it with a bronzer so I'm going to use
the nude Stix nudies all over face color
and the shade Bondi Bay we're gonna use
this taken a slightly warm up and
contour the face now if you're doing
this after applying your foundation just
be sure that you're not putting the
cream on top of anywhere that is
powdered because that that is
a good recipe so we're just gonna blend
that in with our foundation brush okay
so you can see that gives a really nice
natural cannae summer go to the skin
nothing to a Sidious not much commitment
there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go in with my NARS Casino bronzer and we
are gonna really bronze up the face
because there's nothing there then
bronze skin in the summer so I'm just
gonna go on top of my cream bronzer with
that once I've got my kind of first
later bronzer on I'm gonna take a bigger
brush and just do that again and this is
just gonna make it kind of look a little
bit more bronzed everywhere and then I'm
just gonna bring that bronzer down my
neck saves and my nose just a little bit
my face is pretty matte so I'm gonna add
the light back into my skin and I'm
going to use the Becca opal highlighter
but first I'm gonna use for all nighter
setting spray again so when you do this
it says it's all the powders it makes
them go right into the skin and then
when your skin is slightly still damp
that's when you put your highlighter on
and it makes it Pauline dang you will be
sugar and again we just need to wait for
this to dry and then we're gonna quickly
put on or highlight so I'm going to take
this and we're gonna highlight all the
usual spots
I love highlight and above my brow when
I've got a mount for in de chinon
because it just adds that Shane and go
back to your skin Cupid's ball top of
the nose and just the bridge of the nose
and then I like to Pat that in with my
fingers absolutely obvious with this
skin so know that your skin is fine I'm
gonna shoot off-camera really quickly
and do my eyebrows and then when I get
back we'll do our eyes with a very
exciting in the palette okay
rows are on and let's do a nice okay for
eyes I'm gonna be using a palette that I
am really excited about this is the
brand new Born to Run palette by urban
decay these colors are brilliant I am
really really excited about this palette
and today I want to try something a
little bit different I know you guys get
super bored of me with my usual warm
brown smokey eyes but I do just love
doing them but today I'm gonna try out
the green colors that's what I want to
do so I'm gonna be using this kind of
end of the pallet I really want to use
this color right here wonder lust I
think it's gorgeous and then may be able
to like a nice play and a corner or
something so we're gonna focus on this
color right here but it still swatch
test oh it's gorgeous it's just like a
really beautiful khaki clean and I know
I've got green eyes but I never do a
green eyeshadow ever today's the day I'm
just gonna powder underneath my eyes one
more time so if we have any fallout it
will be easier to clean up but I'm just
gonna go for that guy well let's start
with that color
wanderlust it's green and when you go in
with a fluffy brush and try blending it
into the keys just to see what happens
oh okay
we're gonna read that fall over that
same cause whew there's way far away I'm
gonna use a little flat brush just to
start putting that on the lid Oh
color is stunning really nice green I
quite love that and you know what I feel
like it's a very urban decay look I feel
like our going to care one of the only
brands that use shimmer all over the
lids like quite a lot in the campaigns
and we're gonna blend that out with a
clean brush I think their eyes per se
gorgeous I know that it's not a perfect
blend up here but I don't mind it
because I think it's quite a grungy
color alright okay love that oh thank
god
okay let's use that color again why ever
never done could be nice before this is
great oh I'm so excited for this palette
you get a really nice bag better with
this palette as well which I am pretty
excited about I'm gonna go in with the
shade beg sky with my finger and I'm
just gonna Pat that onto my legs oh my
god that is so nice
okay I'm actually just gonna leave the
top of my eyes like this I think I'm
just gonna take a little brush and my
baked opal highlight just highlight my
browbone because that makes the
I shadow just blend that a little bit
more it's really a handy little tip and
actually I've had a thought I'm gonna
take that sheet again big sky just here
on a brush once I've got plenty of
product I'm gonna spray that with my
only or spray again we're getting a lot
of uses out of spray today and I'm gonna
use that just to intensify that color on
the lid right love that I think when I
put lashes on with this it's just gonna
make it look I'm just gonna pop on the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara and
my pre-loved
Miami Lily lashes this is actually a
nice look if you just wanted to be a
mascara throw it out there I am going to
relax the city but if you fancy just
ruinous with mascara I think that it's
really pray because the LED is so bright
well at worth waiting for our lashes to
dry I'm just gonna drag the Wonder lost
color I'm gonna just drag that
underneath my eye just using a teeny
tiny brush and then just bought a
mascara while I'm waiting for my lashes
to finish off drying I'm gonna pop the
Beco highlight in the inner corner then
one remember the last eyes
do you know a shadow makes me feel like
a badass I swear to God just gonna
quickly do my little freckle I'm gonna
zoom you and we'll do our lips and
finish this look off okay far lapse
because we've gone with a pretty green
green eye I'm gonna go for a nude sorry
okay well I'm pretty much using a fill
face of Urban Decay I thought I may as
well go for a liner as well this is the
liner and broken you guys know that my
favorite lip liner of all time is liar
by Urban Decay but literally I had five
and there were all of it this size that
throw them out so I'm gonna use broken
and then I'm gonna use an oldie but
goodie this as the blondie multi-step
bite bite Beauty which I've not used in
ages but it's a really gorgeous light
lighten it
so you guys that is the finished look I
hope you really liked it I have to say I
am so impressed with the eyeshadow and
how exhale down about how my skin looks
so what I'm gonna do to really put this
to the test as right now it is half past
1:00 in the afternoon and what I'm going
to do is I am going to go out me and
Jack have a bit of a day plan we're
gonna go for a food into the cinema and
then when I get back I'm gonna film an
update and show you guys exactly what
this makeups looking like to see if the
owner or it does last well not only but
I'll do and yeah I'm really excited to
see the results I think that what I
really hope that it's gonna last all day
so I'll chicken about ten o'clock and
then I'll do a little updates through
the day as well so ten o'clock will mean
that I'll have had the foundation on for
eight and a half hours which i think is
pretty much all my yeah I really hope
you like this video I will see you in
the chickens and other than that I will
see you in the next video alright
hello just a quick check in Jack night
went for a really nice late lunch
and then we were gonna go to the cinema
but we didn't end up going partly
because we didn't know whether we could
be bothered and also I was too scared or
skinny from haha it's currently 831 so
I've had this makeup on for seven hours
I have not touched up a thing I've not
touched my face my let my eyes nothing
I've actually hide this makeup on is
raining outside I've been out in the
rain with the dog a couple times
and I've had my feet I don't know what
it is right but I think when you're a
dog owner you buddy your face and your
dog's right don't ya
so they're not a couple of times as well
and I think the makeup is holding up
really well even the lips not that bad
coming off a little bit here but the
foundation is definitely a little bit
more glory I've got a little tiny dry
patch here from a blemish usually when I
do my makeup and I'm out for parallel or
whatever if I'm not in the house I did
not touch my face this is a thing I
never touched my face but pointer my
nose I forget and I'll sit like this and
I'll sit like that and I'll put my face
and drivers for and I'll just forget so
I have touched my face more than usual
by something this makeup looks Wow
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go
we're gonna watch la baleine I need to
make myself some dinner
and they'll do a final check-in after la
Valen before I take all this slap oh no
good oh I I really want to take it off
now you know when you're just chilling
you just want to be able to rub your
face maybe even put a face mask on when
you watch a program but I'm not gonna do
it I'm gonna keep on for you guys I hope
you appreciate it
oh my god so as 20 past 10:00 at night
so I've had this makeup on for nearly
nine hours and I think it looks snatched
sorry I'm so tired that okay let me show
you close up so this is what the
foundation looks like after eight hours
and I make up I suppose as well I have
not touched up anything I have not put
more foundation on I've not put more
lipstick on I have literally not touched
my face since I filmed this tutorial
earlier on so I am really impressed like
I'm not even blotted my face and I know
usually I am all Yoli so I am very
excited about this combination and we'll
proceed to keep on using this and I'm
going to test oh when I'm abroad next
well actually Jack and I are going to
New York really soon and it's really
humid there I'm gonna taste that site
when we're there because this is a
potential suitor for perhaps my way to
makeup because I also took a flash photo
of my face and it looked flippin amazing

all good I hope you guys like this thing
