I'm going to show you how to do this cut
crease and Lorelai cut pieces are
difficult and I think my body news that
I was filming because things started
school of it rolling towards the end but
we got the earth we go up there I don't
have quite a lot of people asking for
this tutorial so I hope that you like it
minute here and and if you want to see
her I created this looks peachy
okay so I've already done that I and
either obviously as usual I have
prepared my led with lingual Pinkpop and
I have set my entire led with the Kat
Von D translucent powder it's supposed
that I use all the payments while
creditable anyway the power I'm going
used to be and the more than a minute on
palette again I really love it I think
it's beautiful to a million faculty and
I'm going to show you how to create this
cut crease look so the first thing I'm
going to do is a wiggle end with the
color at Sanford ah I'm going to say it
my entire lid again and I'm going to go
in with fear about products and just
going to make sure there is no creasing
at all on my framework and just get my
eye that nice matte would be these days
I've been kind of threw it at my brows
first and for my eye makeup I do think
with the cut crease it's nice to kind of
do the cut crease price and then do the
grade just so you don't end up with
indigo - all day or anything like that
the next thing I'm going to written
Rinnegan must be shoed
berthed full inch and I'm just going to
use my max tortora brush my secret and
I'm going to pop that any crease and
start just working that backwards and
forwards a bhi chaar those are really
pigmented so you just need a little bit
at a time it's always good just to can
add F pen with a little bit fuller back
and then start applying rather than
going with tons of products an entire
blender so a little bit at a time as the
key to make sure you get that brush
nation high up it really helps with your
blender and if you look at this site the
 Reese is really elevated from there
try and connect keep my shadow assumed
shape so when I get to the end of my eye
I just kind of
shows all the street out and make sure
it makes blend it and bringing that
shadow right and here as well because if
you look at quite directly into the
inner corner I think the one thing of
cup juices that I used to struggle with
a lot more as I was nervous to put too
much product or in my eyes it's actually
really important to have that name can
have build up a product before you cut
that crease now I'm going to start
building the crease up with a little bit
of this color here realgar thin brush
and I'm just placing that any piece
first and then bringing it out that can
I see them same way and then when I get
to the side of my eyes again I'm just
going to elevate in that shadow shape
and then using the same eye brush just
to blend out right into my foundation
now I'm going to go in it with these
sheep Venetian red which is just here it
looks quite pipes to me and I think it
looks quite pinky on the eye as well but
we're building it up the it really kind
of helps the day it's all kind of tying
together I'm just using that same brush
again if you struggle if you feel like
your blends to bag maybe swap have
smaller brush my hand is sweet and car
chases really stress new still and then
actually you need to I'm going to go
back into the rush transition shades by
orange and we've won with that and then
just going to use that color to help
blend out of pink now I'm going to go in
with my semester to Serie C brush and
the shade love letter which is just here
it's super great point but amazing when
you start in a layer on top of all these
other colors I'm going to go with this
brush too little bit smaller and it's
going to start building that operate and
decrease weight prior to the inner
corner again and then creating that
shape and outside as well they all know
that looking at self copies before eh
let me get sharp with the concealer now
I'm going to swap to my - to source from
deliver another favorite of mine and I'm
going to go in with the shade here at
Cypress number the darkest shade in the
palette I'm just going to use a tiny bit
of earth to start dancing up back please
if you look at how that I it means like
a kind of small amount of that color you
actually see so I'm going to walk back
to my two to four and just start
blending that with a little bit of that
Venetian red color and a little bit of
that realgar color is really more
oriented towards once I put the colors
on I'm going to swap to a clean brush I
said by luck see two to nine brush and
I'm going to go over to shade varamyr
just here and it's a really gorgeous
highlight shades and we're going to
start just on my brave one and that
helps blend as well if you're struggling
to get like many soft blend up to the
growth using any kind of highlighting
sheet to help everything gain much in a
straight and again if using the sytem
attitude for just the connector right
about shadow oak and then using the
bright orange color just to help that
diffuse into my skin when I was with a
little bit more of that directorship
sizes ombre and my two very famous mess
just going to put that right in the
crease and then a little bit that for an
orange and realgar shade just the
war-torn is just to help lift that again
okay now that our photo was on I'm
actually going to go straight and and
cut this creep you hear that the factory
but the factory next to my soft and flat
and it's too noisy Avery the product
values to cut all my pieces now as the
heart shape you as unreal for this job
it's really really pigmented and I use
be she's late so I'm going to put that
on the back of my hand and the brush
that makes all those easier and more
possible viewing it as the t26
smudger brush form to the Weaver it is
the perfect shape for cutting crease so
I'm going to go end the back my hand
pick up a sphere ended up for that I'm
going to start in my inner corner so as
you can see where I sort the crease and
here I'm going to just copy that
and then I'm just going to carry the
concealer on I'll eat cottage cheese
just a little bit higher than my actual
crease it just stopped any kind of dark
hair I will crease it on to the crux and
it just makes my eyes look bigger and
it's like the other thing that you want
to cut please to do basically what makes
it easier is that the concealer the
brush actually can oppose the crease
naturally you can do it rough first
you can see it kind of roughly done the
sheet and edit things can it save you up
and you look at your pigmented
and I've been that concealer rate under
to say my eye as well and then there I'm
just going to went and smooth out that
lay and then I'll explain consider kind
of Fargo nanometers realistic yet that
makes greatness now once that's looking
at things smooth and we went and mattify
it then we're way with the Morrissey MCC
3 and PC template that we used the first
stick in the map I have is nail stone
and I'm just going to place that on all
over this see not getting too close
to the edge yet because this brush is a
bit to the best of that I'm just not
buying a right out here and then I'm
going to swap over it to the Charlotte
Tilbury lip brush this is really nice
has got a nice sharp edge and willowmere
that same shades and I'm just going to
mattify rape along the line now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to highlight my
our corner using the same shade on you
to highlight the road here is Burma and
I'm going to use that same Luxy brush
that I used on the gray boys I'm going
to start packing out on and I'm not shy
with a stuff I want it to be so now I'm
going to start smoking at my lower lash
line I'm going to run with the sandwich
with a brush and I'm a she's gonna go
straight and it was - she's a lovely so
just here it's a pinky one and we're
going to start smoking out that lower
lash line
and then I'm going to go and lift the
sheet burnt orange and do it the same
thing this is just going to help that
pink times the show nicely though and I
still see and then I'm just going to
call over that again
with the churches or Mac once the car
seats you can or you can leave if you
like but I like Delana I'm going to use
my super liner from cat onesie and this
is the quest model flick for me so I'm
going to start an inner corner and then
I'm just going to kind of follow that
crease and then I like to get the tongue
kiss just here where the end of my eyes
it just makes my rained eyes look can
work in a cat light the last of the
mascara I'm going to use either the pure
big look mascara really nice I've been
using this just buy it too and it's
awesome if you build up a few times and
then the lashes I'm going to use are the
relative arches and my Kunal's these are
one of my favorite kind of style familiy
lashes and also we'll be filming on B TV
which is amazing for those guys in the
UK so I'll let def style down well also
less a few of my other favorite fails
just involved
while I'm waiting for my last is really
dry I am going to use the nude speak a
week pencil by tart it's really really
brightening on your waterline and it
does not move all the so what I'm going
to use that first for report relapses on
so that is the eye part finished and
then I'm going to show you guys how I'll
be doing my brows lately
so okay that was really stressful my
glow started to enroll really really
badly I might leave that in a way the
guys that is how I create my cup
stitches I'll be like that thanks fact a
little bit pear shape towards the end
but such as like these to happen to me
all types and everyday I hope you like
that and let me know if there's anything
