I'm gonna show you how to create this
entire I just scratched my own face I'm
going to show you how to create this
entire look it is super dramatic II can
amaze cool-toned blue sparkly eye
winning I hope you really like that I
have my hair tied back I mean business
we're here for the makeup that's it if
you'd like to see how I created this
tutorial then please stay tuned let's do
this so all my skincare is already done
and I'm just gonna go straight and with
my primers and things like that first
thing I'm going to use as the same tape
Beauty Pro filter matte primer this is
the soft matte primer I'm just going to
take one little pump on the back of my
hands and I'm just gonna play that to my
center areas and this stuff is just as
really a primer it keeps me in control
of the middle of my face it stops me
from getting too oily it keeps my friend
nation and really well and it works
really nicely underneath this foundation
I'm gonna use today I really liked the
way it looked after everything was done
next I'm gonna go in with my foundation
this is the iconic London foundation
stick this is the shade 2.2 which is a
little touch light for me if you can see
is they're pretty good marks actually
but I like a nice cap and foundation so
I'm gonna play this straight to my face
and then I'm going to mix it with my
other color that I used to use when I
was a bronze goddess I'm just applying
that everywhere and then to point one so
that shade was two point two this is two
point one which is are actually darker
you can see I'm just gonna put that in
between some of the other color and
we're gonna play in that end in the end
I'm just going to use my little handheld
brush this is the evil brush for my
chronic London it's the beautiful rose
gold one and this is the buffer brush
and we're just gonna buff that and her
skin
this makes really quick work of blending
your foundation and when I'm using these
thick foundations obviously iconic
London is the brand of the foundations
thick and the brushes they worked really
nicely together just adding more of the
tanned one and then I feel that you can
kind of build this up I think coverages
definitely meet jumbo buildable and I
like my full coverage this brush is
really good for going down your neck
because it's so big and Dawn blames
everything in baby hair get out of my
life from here I'm gonna go in with my
concealer and I am trying the all
nighter concealer by urban decay I
actually used this ages ago before it
launched and I really liked it and it
was so difficult to get my hands on it
so I just got it in the mail while I was
away traveling so I'm gonna try this out
today and tell you guys how much I like
it because I really do like it I used it
yesterday at loot salad although I must
admit I'm so used to the huge Bank
applicator from Tarte
that I find this little small one really
weird but you definitely don't need as
much product as you would with time it's
super fill coverage in the shade that
I'm using right now is medium neutral
which is a little bit dark compared to
this foundation I'm just gonna blend
that end with it cannot synthetic don't
brush my eyebrows are so bad this giant
line is really really Mesa Matt Mira
stain
they go together really nice there
actually if you think I look a little
bit different I go my breast ended today
and they are super dark I kind of love
it I'm only going to really go through
my brows with brow gel today I think I'm
just going on my lines with the old
nature concealer from urban decay again
I'm just gonna blend that out while I
put too much on there
geez Louise and I tried this as an
eyeshadow base yesterday and it worked
really well really nice now pray over on
all of the creams I'm going to contour
with the iconic foundation stick as well
this is probably the only time that I
cream corn syrup because these products
just blend together really easily so
this is the variation set in 3.2 it's a
kind of really nice ashy deep her torso
but it's gonna and it's not too actually
I can still cannot bronze with it
I look like a real youtuber and then
it's blend that and I'm going to use the
sculpting brush which is also the e-book
collection I always do this I always go
to hand and because it's a foundation
stick you're getting a little bit added
coverage as well which is absolutely
famous immediately this just makes me
think I should do this every day because
look at that not bad huh
next thing I'm going to do because I've
used so many cream products I need to
kind of set my face a little bit I'm
going to go in with a Kat Von D blotting
powder in the shade light
this is well lost it needs to play spray
no and I'm gonna head out underneath my
eyes and on my ledge as well just to
prepare for eye makeup that concealer
set on my legs already that's crazy so
what I need to do next time is powder my
eyeballs cracker because it's creased a
little bit but it affects that powder
that don't nose move anymore and then
before I add any more bronzer I'm going
to take Patrick stars powder by Mac this
part is amazing for me ken and I don't
do it that much but I love getting my
little velvet sponge from Elysee
cosmetics going in with the pointy side
and then just really carbonate that
contour I've noticed it makes a huge
difference and for tours
and that says probably the heaviest
glare I've done this year so far and
then another thing I've been doing is
just saying that the size of my nose and
they're just dirty
I'm gonna dust that we don't leave it
too long I just want to sit that little
part of my face before I do my bronzer
now I'm gonna grab my dark tan bronzer
by Mac and I'm just going to sculpt my
cheeks a little bit more I feel like I'm
literally getting rid of the jet-like
blamed by the lamed
I'm looking sufficiently crazy painted
your eyes let me assume you win this is
the 25/8 palette from morphe I've used a
bunch before but I thought I would bring
it back I would agree and I look that
I've done before that it was of our day
and holes you guys wanted a tutorial
because it's a little bit different for
me so the first column below is a one
brain but don't judge me yet
we're just going to go in with that
color and we're gonna start to build up
the crease and the brush that I'm using
as the semester 3 to brush this is one
of my favorite eyeshadow brushes but
here I created this eye look the other
day and loads you guys were asking for a
tutorial so your nose just backwards and
forwards motion into usual it's so
pretty easy to start your blends and
when it's a color with I said Stella of
a warm Brown transition but let me go
deeper you'll see that I'm switching
over to the killer tones and these
pilots I know the more forgets and a lot
of beef a lot of people think that
youtubers will you promote them for
their cords and things like that but I
actually really like Mary shadows I
think they're really good and they're
obviously affordable for you guys and
you can get them really easily on like
Beauty Bay and things like that and they
just perform really well once I've done
that I'm going to swap over to a smaller
brush this is this mess to 3/5 effect
and I'm gonna go in with this metal
shades here which is a really cool toned
Brown and we're gonna start building up
her crease again
backwards and forwards just pecking your
brush up and so you can blame the
transition shade and the deeper
together I don't want anybody good on
toilet we're gonna cover our leg up
totally anyway just picking up little
bits of pigment at a time and blend it
back and forth and then I'm going to
swap my brush over to just a little bit
of a smaller brushes at the 247 and when
you learn with the same color I'd really
need to wash my brushes before anyone
says but that jet lag is just I don't
want to do it I'm gonna buff that
underneath my eye and if you've been
here before you'll know that I do this
because I love our really smoky
under-eye but also when you mix your
eyes shadow and with your concealer
underneath your eye it really stops it
from creasing it's like a powder in your
eye again it just makes it look seamless
all day
I also if your eyes look hella big I'm
gonna bring that up just to kind of meet
any with the crease when we get to that
stage I'm going to go in with this color
here it's the second darkest color in
the palette is really pigmented but it
can give a little bit for light so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my little
flat brush this is two five three from
Smith pop it and in the shadow and I'm
just gonna press that light look at that
pigment and it's gonna lightly place
that on all over every gave we have like
already I'm getting fully but because
I've powdered my face already that's all
I told just dust off but what you do is
you kind of lean your face forward a
little bit
do not know if you guys didn't see me do
this
and then just build that up right up to
the crease right up to that a coroner
and again it's nice because that's color
so dark and cool too and a little bit
different you know and I'm just gonna
take a little bit about darker color and
then it's in session color I'm just
gonna blend those together and start to
smoke out the eye a little bit more
right how crazy is that that's just one
eyeshadow look at their friends so this
is my Kennedy 2d smokey eye do this you
like like BAM date night and then you
just need to take a little bit of time
to make sure your blending is all right
always going back home with your Becker
brushes for this kind of look I'd really
like to do my eyebrows last because I
don't know how big my blend is gonna end
up I might want to invade my eyebrows
you know so I'm just gonna do that with
the other eye and I'll just do it I
won't walk you through this one but I'll
just do it on camera so you can see
like I said it just takes a lot of
blending so for the next part we're
gonna jazz this up a little bit if you
like your mat and your neutrals then
this is a really beautiful just smoky
eye you can definitely just stick with
this but I'm gonna amp up a little bit
here I have one of the Tarte
rolling paints and this is called steal
the show got my coconut red plus my fave
so I'm just gonna spray that and once
I've done that I'm just gonna put this
all over my legs and it's just a really
beautiful midnight blue Gris like it's a
really lovely beautiful ways to wear
blue I struggle with blue eyeshadow
actually I don't bloody later but this
is done and then while that still just
drying I'm gonna go so I have to stay
like this I'm gonna go in with the nerd
heavy mantle cutter from Urban Decay
this is the shade gamma ray which is a
really beautiful blue or are you gonna
put that on top it's like a bluemix it's
over and the only thing about these I
obviously use these all the time but you
always have to kind of pop them out well
that's good I'm quit next thing and then
I'm just gonna go and talk with the man
till the shower again and I just packed
in that glitter right and then you can
kind of wait for that to start to dry
before you be blamed or anything so I'm
just gonna do that with the other eye
and I'm going to go in with acai first
and just start to darken up that crease
right into the inner corner because our
Dark Blues in there anyway I definitely
think you could do this look eyes first
this is quite a heavy eye to do your
friend Asian already done I'm going to
add a little bit more of the ARB
indicated glutes are just cuz I feel
like I lost some of it I'm getting kind
of like Pat McGrath are you I know that
the clutter is dry I'm going to go in
with the Marc Jacobs remarkable liner
that's thangs really good it's just
super super black I'm gonna add on just
leave baby slicks just like that to kind
of elongate the eye a little bit
I'm gonna pop off and do my mascara and
lashes and I'll be right back hey
gorgeous I'm going to use my brow
shaping mascara from Inglot this is in
the shade not sure start brighten though
and I'm just gonna put this through my
eyebrows because I just had them tonight
they're super dark so I don't really
need to do anything to them for anyone
asking I went to knife because the same
place I got my nails done and they just
worked a little tight one for me and I
feel so much better if I make up one
when my brazier nice and dark like that
I honestly have no idea it was natural
my eyebrows I've ever been I'm just
gonna highlight my inner corner I'm my
very own with my darling highlights and
for Mac just add a little bit of light
and I'm just gonna finish off my bottom
lashes one more time then mascara that
I've been using as the hot and naughty
lash by Mac is love it and then the
lashes I've got on today are the Lily
lashes and mikonos and I really like
them but I actually threw things that
they are really pretty severe for this
look like I think you could probably get
away with use and Westby repear if you
wanted what do you think is in you it
and finish this face okay so my skin has
stayed fairly ma actually which is good
and I'm gonna add the highlights back
into my skin using the iconic London
illuminator drops I'm going on a holiday
really soon and I'm packing these guys
too
shei my bad I forgot what I was doing
and I put far too much in the back of my
hand
he literally needs one or two drops and
I'm just gonna start passing that on my
cheeks and it just gives such a radiant
glow
do you guys know already that all of
these drops you've seen me use them a
million times and one bottle lasts so
long because you only really use a
couple of drops a day the weather being
the way it is having a kind of duty
highlight or rather than a powder
highlight looks way more flesh touching
the end and then if you wanted to get
extra bright and I have all this excess
in the back of my hand you can use a
little Beauty Blender just know it's for
lips I'm gonna keep it pretty pretty
natural because this look is looking
strong
so I'm gonna use my Urban Decay lipliner
in the shade stark naked and we're just
gonna align our lips
and then I'm going to bring that the lip
liner onto the lip and just kind of
color my lip in and then I'm going to
stick on the dose of colors undressed
lip gloss really nice lighten it and now
I'm just gonna add my little freckle in
with my I don't even over this from Max
Factor masterpiece honestly I wouldn't
recommend this it's just the thing I use
right now I'm looking for a really nice
little felt tip Brown later if any of
you can recommend they need to film a
fair claim so you guys guys the finished
look I hope you liked it let me know
down below of what you would like to see
from me next as always I will link

than that I will see you in the next
