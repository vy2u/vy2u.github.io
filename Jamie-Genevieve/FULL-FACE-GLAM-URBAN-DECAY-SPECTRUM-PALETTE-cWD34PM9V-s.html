I am going to show you how to create
this actually haul thing I did my whole
face today and but I'm going to be
focusing on the new Urban Decay spectrum
palette I got this through the post
through the meal I would use excited its
kind of inspired me to work with new
colors again work birthday with brace
which has been it's been a while so I'm
going to show you how to create this
kind of properly pinky smokey eye well I
better get in there
well Beth sass I'm just really excited I
hope you guys like it if you'd like to
see how I created this like stitching so
I have already used my clothes cream on
my skin which is by skin Iceland I've
talked about it a few times before it I
like it over enemy but that has been my
favorite moisturizer for underneath my
makeup lately it's been really fab next
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
in with my YSL top secrets instant
moisture glue Cramer I've been using
this consistently for the last two weeks
roughly and I really love it I think
it's beautiful
it gives my skin I really need glue it's
another nice light barrier and between
my foundation and my skin which I
think's been helping it helping this
condition of my skin as well foundation
today I'm going to use a drifter and
beneath the Droid recommendation I'm
gonna use my Rimmel too much foundation
and she 200 source page I got that right
I have used this I fear a few times I do
like to take two whole pumps on the back
of my hand and then I'm just going to
apply that with my Beauty Blender I
haven't used this a couple of times
before but since my Halloween tutorial I
can't stop using it I just love it I
think it's a really great drugstore
foundation I have such a high color on
my lips that I always go over them with
foundation always so yeah this
foundation is a really lovely texture it
does last really will if you payed it
properly but I just think it's a really
a beautiful finish it's not it's not as
heavy that's what I usually wear and see
there it feels a lot later as well and I
know you guys want me just gonna start
using can a more affordable makeup
don't understand I forget this is my job
so I'm really lucky to have so much
makeup from all different sides of the
spectrum but I'd love to it can I create
more tutorials that are a little bit
more on there and the budget brand side
so I hear you and I'll do that so yeah I
don't think that's really really fresh
really natural it the color for me is
really great I think I'm roughly an NC
25 and Mac concealer I'm going to use
which I have been used and you can see
is nearly empty is my Maybelline the
eraser I anti-age perfect and cover
concealer and this is in the shade light
obsessed base concealer well is that I
think in all honesty I still prefer my
Tarte sheep teeth but again something
that's still pretty easy to get and a
little bit on the more affordable side
this is really great and I like to just
go ring my nose as well so I do get a
fair bit of that but it sought an
expense so it's that I don't really mean
and then just going to boil it then I'm
going to just change and use a little
brush to go underneath my eyes this is
just as a Weber concealer brush now I'm
going to powder underneath my eyes I'm
going to sit so I'm going to use my Kat
Von D lock-it poser and translucent
Despero is honestly includable its
social days so I'm just using my damp
Beauty Blender to sit under my eyes and
you know what that's pretty much all I
do it's only my eyes that I sit I just
leave the rig while my under eyes are
bacon I'm going to go in with my laying
law paint pot and I'm just going to use
my finger to apply a nice layer of that
all over my eye to pray it for what's to
come
say thing exciting so I'm gonna go and
we do my brows off-camera
I'm just going to fill them in with my
dick bro and use some sort through the
front to make them nice and kind of
bitchy and then I'm gonna just take a
little bro do through the tube but I'll
be back here in just a sec for them
brazier on so I just used the sort
technique from my soup video and pretty
much the same products I use nothing
as well and the point wanted to know is
I'm going to sweep away this powder and
the relic far more a week than I feel
I'm going to set my eye with my Kat Von
D translucent powder just because
there's not really a color and the
palate I'm going to use that is suitable
so I'm just gonna set that I make sure
it's nice and matte might not like my
dress today and yes you can't see things
like that but yourself
just live love your base life and give
yourself a compliment going do it right
now go yourself a compliment what do you
like about yourself
I like my eyebrows today your turn I'm
super excited
I got this in the post and yeah I'm
really excited you guys are so
supportive of me but there are I do see
the odd comment thrown around that I
only use neutral eyeshadow that's going
to change today so I went on periscope
and I said what would you guys like to
see with this palette and the most
popular choice was the pinks and a
purple so I'm going to do a look with
the pinks and the purples today and then
if you guys would like to see more looks
with maybe the blues and the greens do
let me know and I will do that for you
so yeah we're going to basically I'm
going to teach you how to use pink and
purple eyeshadow and still look like a
dunk that's my goal today yeah I'm
really excited the powers beautiful
super sturdy it's a really cute palette
this is stunning this gym this UD gym
and it's pretty thick it's better than
the basics palette bad polymer dark it's
an expensive mirror great next size
right well rid route let's jump into
this I'm going to start off with the
pinks get my transition shades and then
we'll go into the purples for a little
bit of day okay let's go in with the
shade paranoia first which is sure MIDI
that I love over in the case so I'm
expecting good things
oh that's pretty that's almost
lilac and yes I'm using shimmer in my
crease never going to win with the shade
gossip just here which also looks kind
of shimmery but think that's that we are
feeling today we're just gonna start
darkening up that pink you already know
there's going to be glitter involved in
this look the brush am using is my Sigma
tapered blending brush they'll not clean
that Mac brush I need to clean my
brushes late now and yeah and I'm just
using little backwards and forwards
motions it's so easy because they're got
a slight shimmer to them although I
don't like I don't hate it at all
usually I'm not a financial shadows in
my crease but I am I really just want to
use this whole palette to create this
look so and I'm bringing that pink right
and here I'm not keeping up notes aid
reason because that's what the Purple's
going to do I really just want to all
this is Matt this flip tomorrow
okay I'm going on with this color here
sketch I'm going to use the tapered
blending brush it from Urban Decay no
it's a bit smaller and I'm going to go
in with that shades sketch and my crease
I'm just using the tapered end of the
brush to place that propel just right in
the crease and then I'm using the side
of the brush just to help blend that up
towards the pink just going to dust away
the excess that's why it's really good
to powder your eyes underneath before
you start playing with color it means
that you can just dust to be the follow
so I'm going to continue just to build
up that purple and my crease and then
I'm kind of left in the end can il be in
that and as you can see just to give
that kind of life I'm going to start
bringing that underneath my eye no and
I'm going to go straight in
we're sketch again the color I was just
using and when it when with the urban
decay it tapered blending brush again
I'm just going to start smoking out
underneath my eye
and then I'm going to go over top with
the shade gossip just here and my Sigma
brush okay one thing I will see I think
the Pink's have a lot more pigment in
the Purple's but that's quite common
Purple's not an easy color to formulate
as far as I know I'm not cause I'm tall
adjusted or anything but that's
something I've just noticed and product
and when I start building up that purple
again with the shaved ëletís which is
just here which is darker again that's a
color was using before and we're going
to go in with this one I like that shade
of law I think that is beautiful as they
create a nice day without too much work
pigments great and then I'm going to
blend that out with my fav painter shade
this is honestly my favorite color
already gossip
your work done is I've actually blended
this mochi right into my brew at the
front and then I left the tail my bro
here just underneath for your product so
I can highlight like normal building up
that purple a little bit more and I'm
just using the size of my brush just to
blend the colors all together make sure
there's a nice kind of diffusion feel
like there's a lot but pink underneath
my eyes now i'm going to take my morphe
aim at 5:07 brush which is just even
smaller and I'm going with that darkest
purple color delirious and go right
under the eye
yep that pigment amazing that weights
amusing I'm not going to use it today
but I just wanted to show you I'm going
to win with the shared pattern I adjust
here and I'm actually gonna push that
onto my lid so I'm just pushing that on
yeah I like that I'm just going to blend
this little corner again soca music
patchy I'm going to use the glitter and
ACDC which is Urban Decay's veils they
have email Elena and I'm going to start
applying that just onto my lid so I kind
of use the side of the brush to get all
the glitter off and then it's all nice
and then I just gonna use the brush to
move it around
I love these flutter laners I think
they're so easy to apply they last all
day that amazing you kid there's got
such a faint little point you can just
do glitter later if you want you can do
what over I'm just going to use my
finger just to Pat the excess a week
they don't want it to be too glittery or
white like I wore and then I like to
just go back in with my blending brush
and just go over the crease couple times
to make sure that there's no glitter
just hanging out in there yes I don't
really do like over this Luke I'm going
to leave it super colorful and just do
mascara and lashes so I just glued up my
lashes I'm gonna whack some with mascara
one I'm going to use my Tarkus mascara
from Tarte
so now I put my mascara on I'm going to
stick my lashes they are pretty much dry
and these are Lily lashes and I actually
cannot remember the style for the
aerosol wispy in so beaut and again this
little lash applicator just wins the
award for based makeup application look
at that boom so now my eyes are done I'm
going to finish off my makeup so first
thing we do is I'm going to bronze and
I'm going to use my NARS Laguna I've
used this every day since I've go with
it and I honestly love it Tibet it can
go so lightly partici
and I can't really tell what causes that
it might be dry skin it might be my
foundation finish but whenever I've used
this foundation then this bronzer it's
always been fine so I really do like it
I think it's like the perfect color to
warm up this skin whether to look Encana
orange and I'm just using my big morphe
in fool to brush and then I'm going to
swap back to my Smith one-one-two brush
14 feet and I'm going to slightly
contour and then I going to say to my
nose underneath my nose just to add a
little bit of Sun there highlight time
I'm gonna stick to my guns and go with
my old fave and when you use Becca
or pal just to get that glow you know
live my best life and I'm going to use
my Weaver fan brush this is in the
filthy say that I have tagged at the
bottom of my videos legal brushes are
super affordable and I just really love
them I think you're perfect for start
and I think they're great for makeup
artists and the quality's there as well
so I love using this fan brush
easy as that I look like I think it's
great and I'm going to use my finger as
always I'm not flipping you off
I'm just doing my highlight you know did
it bring up my temples lately I'm going
to swap my brush to this method to 5/3
and I'm just going to highlight my
browbone just there and that just makes
everything pop I'm gonna go in with
urban decay is broken
yeah I don't want me to use I'm going to
use when my new favorite notes I've used
this before never duel already
I'm going to use tire tears let paint
and salty so one of their new my ranges
and both super late so it makes for this
look because all the paintings on the
eye and I just like to use my finger
to just Pat that in and then lately I
have been making sure to take my many
cups I'm going to use my sleeo D spray
just to set everything that's what
opposed it's really to come oh nice
French so that's just say everything
I'll Whittle this quicker heavy-duty me
a cup of quick fill on and then it's
going to top up my little little dude
I'm a little free at all so I'm going to
squish my lashes on with my little tart
applicator so their own good and then
I'm actually going to go in my water
late with my nabla magic pencil and knit
and you can see how much of a difference
that makes it just totally brightens up
the waterline and that's finished look
you guys I hope you like it
I've really loved creating this look
actually it's been really fun and this
color
