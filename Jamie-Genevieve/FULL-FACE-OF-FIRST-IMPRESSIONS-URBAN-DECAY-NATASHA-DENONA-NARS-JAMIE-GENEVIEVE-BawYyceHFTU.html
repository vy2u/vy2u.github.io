I am going to show you how to do this
entire makeup look I'm trying to Lord's
inner products I know that the title of
this video says first impressions full
face i canna lied most of it as first
impressions most of it as new stuff but
there are some products that I have a
tried already or used for a while or
haven't found any new kind of products
to try from that genre
there's loads of new fun stuff Lords of
super impressive makeup that I'm really
excited about so if you would like to
see how I create this look then please
stay tuned hello
I'm just gonna jump straight and the
products that I've already used on my
skin are the kills iris I extract
activating treatment essence you only
use turocy drops and your hands rub your
hands together and then push that into
your skin all over really really like
this stuff and then on top of that I use
my heels daily reviving concentrate this
is my little baby ones that I use for
traveling very much the first new
product that I've not tried to is the it
cosmetics transforming moisturizing
super cream anti age armor a lot of
promises so it's super sailor my complex
peptide infused collagen hyaluronic
acids i toasted crack absorbing
hypoallergenic and allergy tested as
well so I'm just gonna jump into this or
it's a thick thick cream okay so I'm
going to take a little I'm a and I'm
just gonna drop them together it's got a
really gentle saying yeah it's not
strong at well it's not it's not gonna
bother me and it's super creamy but it
doesn't feel sticky or anything that
feels nice it does feel really
moisturizing so much it's great the
cause I've actually been using and I'm
very excited about this as well this is
the glossary solution and this is like
one of those like solutions that has
your assets in it so I've been using
this every single night what it can do
you know just a little bit because it's
really speeding up the sale process
so you're basically shading your skin
but it's really gentle and I feel like
it's really working on my forehead
mostly because I had some sky bang and
some pigmentation so hopefully that will
get rid of the pigmentation of my head
in my chin but I'll let you know how I
get on with this I've only used it for a
bit three nights so far the cream feels
great on top of that some conclude
quickly as well know for foundation I
have used X once before but it wasn't my
right color and this is the brand new
NARS natural region long wear foundation
the color that I bought myself was
Stromboli which is really gorgeous but
it's a little bit dark for me but I
bought it by itself one day and it was
when I was in New York and I had a kind
of high neck so it looked it looked fade
but I've got another color here which is
called Salzberg which is too late so I
think what I'm going to do is mix these
two together I think it should be
perfect perfect shade the pumps
replaceable I'm gonna take one night I'm
just gonna take two I'm gonna take two
pumps of each and we'll see what we're
left with I'm going to just stick on and
I know I've used s loads but I don't
have a new mattifying primer this is the
fancy Beauty promoter map framer soft
matte blue filter and smoothie touch
Kramer thanks have such long names I'm
gonna add a little bit of that Justin
must enter videos because when I use the
foundation first I just put it on with
my usual skanky underneath which is
pretty much just my moisturizer and my
oils and I did find it was a little bit
hoodoo I've got the two foundations in
the back of my hand I'm just gonna mix
those two together with my brush this is
my Smith 1 1 5 friend Asian brush yeah
I'm just gonna settle that on all over
and you guys know that I prefer a filler
coverage like a full coverage even
though my skin's way back to be in May
so I still like the finish that little
coverage foundation gives me that color
looks great I think there will be a
color that matches me I got this amazing
PR package that has all the colors in it
but I thought I would just use the to
fill bottles so I can see how many pumps
and stuff I would you
and I was gonna learn German oh yeah
that's really beautiful
I've not seen any tutorials using this
condition or anything yet I've tried
this theory from Nam but it was actually
you guys that told me that I needed to
get this ASAP so that's why I bought it
when I was in New York I think that tan
color will be perfect for me when I've
got a little bit of a tan so as a
beautiful it's definitely not matte it's
not super doing like it's not true
oh you're great like that the next
product I'm going to use I have used
some one video before but I want to try
it with this foundation because I
absolutely love it this is the old
nature concealer from urban decay
waterproof little coverage concealer and
this is the shade medium neutral when
he's underneath my eyes I'm gonna use on
my light as well as an eyeshadow primer
cause I tried that yesterday and the day
before actually and it was really great
and I just think as that little bit of
coverage that I'm looking for
it lets playing that in distress and see
how to get one it does say it quite
quickly you don't need to work super
fast but I would blame the G gold
candles this is me using lace and I did
last favor actually and it's working a
little bit so you really just don't need
that much photo it's what it cost this
concealer it's great Wow
okay I'm gonna pop this on my lid and
blend it quickly and then powder it down
I don't actually have a new powder to
show you guys but let me know in the
comments down below if you have found
any really good powders lately once that
concealers on I'm just gonna go in with
my Kat Von D powder at the blotting
powder and she's light mist fangs
brilliant and it's gonna powder my eyes
and I think I'm going to leave my skin
there for now I usually go in and finish
my bronzer and stuff but I've got a few
new things I want to try I have a little
bit of foundation last look at a college
man
obviously I've only got this foundation
on so it does look a lot bit more sleek
you know but you can still see my skin
to minister really nice and you can see
there it goes with it really makes like
- I like it can I taste the note when
you mix brands together to see if they
work on two eyes and I'm very excited
because I'm going to use a collaboration
product right now tres and Leanne as a
youtuber I turn on Instagram right I
have had the pleasure of meeting every
time she's definitely a friend of mine
and she has brought an amazing
collection with Urban Decay everything
about this collection is so tailored to
Kristen it's a really lovely
collaboration at like plan I show you
this you will see how Tristan as you've
got your packed agenda which is really
unique to urban decay they've obviously
made this just for the collaboration
it's all got their kind of pink neon
vibes really really cute and that's
straight here is the kaleidoscope dream
pilot what you can see is all super
bright we've got loads of different
colors in there you guys know that I
love my neutrals but this palette will
definitely come in handy because it's
got all the kind of bright shades that I
would ever reach for like a book I
always do like a pop of color don't or I
could do like a purple eye it's really
cool I'm really excited to try this out
today so this is the palette I'm going
to be using let's check some of the
pigments geez look I'm just gonna show
you her swatches that feels really
beautiful I'm excited to try I've got an
idea for my eye like today already
so that was the Kaleidoscope palette and
then the other night shadow palette I'm
gonna be used and as the the dream eyes
shadow palette which again it's got the
really cute packaging I think this is my
favorite packaging it's like almost like
melted lipsticks or something and then
it's got twists in the end or them decay
Oh in there and then in here we've got
our neutrals so we've got our neutral
palette so I'm going to be going between
this one
the Kaleidoscope pilot we're gonna be
testing the moat enemy here all the
shadows are matte which is great also
it's part of the collaboration
she brought a three lipsticks here we
have the comfort megamat and then
another comfort mat so these are the
colors we've got a kind of purple a
deeper color and then more of a nude and
then we also have a highlighting palette
what an amazing launch sughar three
shades good for all skin tones very cute
it's in the kind of standard three pan
the Urban Decay do they usually do it
with their blusher palette so that's
really cute - let's do this our makeup
first thing we do is I'm going to take
out this little brush I just never use
these weave brushes I've got my brushes
that are like I'm just gonna stick to
them I'm gonna first go in with daydream
and my crease and then I'm gonna start
building out my outer and inner corners
with these shades here and the
Kaleidoscope palette we have the shade
here which I think you pronounced alkene
which is like the space that room puts
on their fruit and stuff - Mexican is
cool so I'm gonna use that shade to it
and then what we're gonna do is a pink
spotlight I we're gonna try that so I'm
gonna go in with daydream first to start
building out of this crease backwards
and forwards motion is this colors nice
it's just like a really standard
transition shade but it's working really
well that is really nice so easy as well
I think I'm actually gonna go in the
street with this shade here now and
we're gonna start fellas and I the
cannot error coroners his colors imagine
so I'm just using little mate to the
product at a time and tapping it on I
wanted to think that concealer is such a
good eye shadow base and I'm bringing
that color up over the crease to start
playing tonight and I'm just used in the
matter of the actual Pollux is cleavage
I would really love to ask why the
shadows are placed like this because I'm
just really not used to it I'm not mad
at it but it's it's freaking me out
Wow so nice then I'm just going on with
my fluffier brush just to start making
sure that it's nicely playing that and I
was really cool the portrait color I'm
gonna go in with the shade talking
underneath my eye just to start really
smoking that I just a dark and dine that
over corner and inner corner I'm gonna
go back in with the DG my shadow palette
and going with the color 8 just here I'm
just adding tiny bits of that darker
eyeshadow and then I'm just gonna blend
that with the warmer shade again so if
your morning's your neutrals you could
stop here you could just add a gold
spotlight I if I'm going to do a Kristin
inspired Island today I'm gonna use
color so I'm gonna go in with the shade
Spitfire just here I'm just gonna use
this little farm eyeshadow brush just
here and I'm gonna go in with that color
iCup loads of product I'm gonna spray
that West my own nature spray also from
Urban Decay and I just sprayed my mirror
and I'm just gonna pack that on the
middle of the eye that looks cute and
I'm gonna bring it up and over the
crease a little bit this has almost like
a nice dual chrome effect to it
and then to add a little bit more
dimension I'm going to go in with the
heavy metal glitter and this is in the
shade cat coal which is just a really
cute kind of baby pink and I'm just
gonna do my usual gonna place the
glitter on and then I kind of tap it
with a brush that I used for the
brighter color and I've actually not
used this color of glitter before this
is the new colors from Urban Decay so
you guys know that I love like Midnight
Cowboy and stuff like that but they
brought a bunch of new colors and
they're V cute now that I've gone and
done this I'm just waiting for the
clutter to dry I'm gonna go back in with
the shade eight from the daydream
palette and just darken up my eyes one
more time what I'm gonna do is grab the
sheet eat one more time and I'm just
gonna run that along my lower lash line
just to tie it all together I really
hate this I'm gonna pop off camera and
do my mascara and eyelashes and I'll be
right back okay so mascara and lashes
are on the mascara I used was the pure
filly tears mascara and all the favorite
of mine but I just got new ones so it
still counts as in her product and the
lashes are the Lily lashes in this fail
can when I do an eye like this it's
quite nice to use a little bit more kind
of natural lashes so you can see the
kind of work that's going into the eye
shadow and stuff well work clothes in
Paris hello I'm just gonna finish off my
eyebrows I've just had them ten edge and
I really like them so I'm just gonna
stick a little bit of the glossy boy Pro
through my eyebrows and that's pretty
much it you guys keeping the brows
natural today and this product just
thickens them up makes them like nice
and groomed
and the right place because we're gonna
be skin focused today okay so know that
our eyes are finished we're gonna go
into skin and honestly I'm very excited
to my skin today because of course new
products the first one is the butter
bronzer by Physicians Formula
picked us up when I was in the States
one time and I've actually never used it
so I'm gonna go in with this and my
usual Smith bronzer brush this is the
one one eight brush I'm just gonna blow
her face up and I paired that this is
just stunning
very natural I even filled it up a bit
little that's actually really nice isn't
it it's blended on top of the foundation
nicely too I look so different to do
with a slate bronzer and rate I blue
Loken I've actually been looking for a
new bronzer because sometimes mink was a
little bit patchy these days that is
spectacular next product I'm very
excited about this as the Natasha de
Nonna diamond and blush palette and I
recently opened this in a PRN box and
and I was pretty excited about it
there's a blush in here honestly I'm not
breakfast on a blush at the base the
times I think when I've got a great eye
it's too much but the highlighting part
I'm gonna really get down with today so
I'm gonna go in with my fingers and this
here which is the diamond glow cream
base I don't know I don't know if it's
gonna be natural or not let's just try
it no it's beautiful
oh my god mrs. really excited it's
creamy but it's not difficult to use
it's not taking my foundation off or
anything
Wow I'm just gonna do super glowy skin
today I think we've got that on no
probably natural but it looks so
beautiful or in my actual skin next
we've got the diamond powder the glow
extreme powder and these two are trees
I'm gonna swatch that so this is what
they look like and it's just when
they're on see the shine beautifully so
I'm gonna just apply these I'm gonna use
this this as the chromatic result top
coat from also from the Kasia - no no
right you open it up and it's like a
little cream base and I actually applied
this to my bare face and it is weird so
it does look really blue but it's not
when you start patting it I don't know
what happens it just disappears now it's
time for the PO DOS so we're gonna do
this one first which is the glue extreme
and then your diamond powder and then
we're going to do the diamond powder on
top ah I know that people will say that
they don't like this because it's too
gluttony I can already tell now I'm
gonna put some of this on my nose that's
crazy nice no I feel like I need to try
a little bit of a brush but I'm too
scared I just dumped my nail into that
one I'm gonna do my lips tonight and
we'll have a look together and see if
there's anything else that needs done so
far let's I'm going to be using a new
product from Maybelline this is the
super state matte pink and the shaved
Ivor I mentioned it in my PR to boxing
hall as well and then I'm just gonna use
my stark-naked from urban decay liner
and I'm just going for a super basic
nerds
I felt like over drawing my lips a
little bit today and then I'm just going
to go straight on top of this guy which
is a really lovely nude I really like
this I don't understand these ones
that's the only thing they're kind of
like a I call it like a teardrop shape
or something
I just think I just prefer a like a
normal applicator but that is nice
I'm gonna add in my friend curls so I'm
just gonna use my all-nighter spray from
Urban Decay again I took one of these
little travel sized ones to New York and
I want to sleep on it event because I
use it that much so they're happy to
have another one okay I'm just gonna try
and start my hand out really quickly and
I'll be right back let's just leave the
here I'm not here dresser kind of let
