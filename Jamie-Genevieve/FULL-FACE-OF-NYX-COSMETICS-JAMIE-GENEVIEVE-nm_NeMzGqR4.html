I'm going to show you how to do that
entire look I am using all next kinetics
products which is super affordable brand
available pretty much everywhere I work
with some quite a lot a really fades
clear this video not sponsored by the
way just wanted to do it just being a
youtuber trying to share math or the
title is not click beat but there are
like 4 products I don't have from next
I'll explain later on there are no
important products I don't think I think
the most important things that I use are
knit semantics for sure so today we have
done a full coverage foundation in news
life obviously but we've done a really
dark intense blue nearly smokey eye
which I really really like okay cool
very different from me no one brain are
you pricked as you guys like to see how
I create this like same stitch and so ok
so I'm going to first of all paint my
skin because my new favorite thing I've
got new to everything basically I want
to show you so the first thing I'm going
to do is hydrate my skin and I'm going
to do that by using the ordinary as
coral Taylor
so polymer teeth solution to an extent
that when a daughter without means but I
really like it so thick one two people
it's eyes drop and this has just got
tons of open sea in it which is really
important for your skin and when is that
first onto my skin I really feel like
what's going to be change and super
rapidly by using that and my advance
rate in order to present those to mix
together plus all my hydration stuff
it's going to never look at lesson to
make a point
also there's a better secret that I've
been using that I'm going to tell you
about reading the course I've been using
virgin eyes is really really important
to use sunscreen because that is
essentially Behrman away the top layer
skin which means Muskaan's and get
called up which means one gets bought
all that good stuff so I really have
been using my sunscreen it religiously
this is the chytrid heliotrope X after
quite a lot of research on what's the
basic enough sunscreen to use this is
actually a sunscreen and plain rice it
right
Chris and it is Elliott so much as an
amoeba MacLean mark when I use those
first my favor you can always like bang
in and obviously protect in my skin as
well it doesn't smell like anything so
there's no smell to speak up but it's a
super sense sense and moisturizer but it
does all the potato stuff that we need
it to do and the most important thing
for me was that look nice with makeup on
top and that it does know because I
think moisturized my next thing that I
do actually believe morals yeah so I
can't hear it so fresh Sally unicorn
aces rappers others opposed the gimmick
but as you like it smells amazing
it's not sex like an oil in the cold
eyelash trying to blame me it's not BEC
like an oil it's one of those trying one
Sun know what's happened so there or
gorgeous difference from the drip and
it's not sick like an oil but it's super
hydrate and it feels more at the color
like it's like a watery it's a good
water to the oil but leave my skin feel
and really high tree edge and then go
away I love it I've been using this
under my foundation to last maybe week
and I really really like the way it's
working it the next day everyone joined
primer face looks with hand cuz I don't
care my face and I'm not going to engage
any quicker than I have to what I've
been doing is using the youth talent one
coconut tanning water
DNA or any morning and it may tape and
it gives you the most gorgeous ball I
swear I would never feel this confident
and no makeup but having a panel of
these makes a huge difference at first
as a bit narrow folks that ever is going
to go all in my hairline and stuff but
it just doesn't this is the easiest
thing for you just literally I give it a
little shake and then just like that and
then I get my neck as well it does a
coconut Stubbs night sweet time and I
have used it for a little while all in
all but this is the first time ever
actually used it more than mate
consistently for like a week in this
kind of my series is amazing and it does
Robert reporters don't do anything that
it just feels so good smells a cool cat
and each time I leave literally I don't
know what else to say about this thing
okay now we're going to go into the
actual me capsule death as E Kofi's next
product there are some parts I don't
have before we get into not quite see I
just don't have them and I just don't
think it was worth seeing and the tail
so the other things I don't have a
mascara and eye shadow primer so to
speak so I'm just going to use a
concealer and a translucent podo but I'm
moving to Y proposals products and I
don't have a glow channel as well so I'm
just going to get something else for
that
but everything else our goal here is NYX
NYX Cosmetics so let's start with the
foundation I'm going to use the total
drop friend Asian right I think I'm
actually going to end up being Mel she
has shoes called Golda and I'm going to
put that one for and then I might end up
late and up so you give it a good shake
I don't know how much to use that looks
okay it might look a little bit dark at
first but what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to highlight with the
concealer right I'm going to need more
of that okay
emerge completely blend that end that's
my rule
I've actually never used this before I
think I used it really quickly one time
on top of something else there's no
fighting music fight sales that is
gorgeous
oh my god am I love that what do
you think Oh seriously really like that
manifesting the tremor
obviously the drop in saying that
annoying you could probably just put up
the back your hands but I am finding
that super easy and then I'm just using
my beautiful ended obviously well that's
another thing I don't have this entirely
next is brushes and things like that I
will use next door to our house
in my mind everyone's kind of got their
own little selection of brushes that
they really like
I absolutely look at her exfoliant okay
nobody is there next HD concealer and
the shades B this is going to be too
late but we're just gonna work within a
very really good things about this I
have used it before never on YouTube but
I have used it before and I just think
it was a good concealer they need
somewhere to their I was in decay naked
skin so we're just going to use this to
highlight more than any sin I don't
really need to conceal any blemishes or
anything make nice cousin stench is so
damn good
okay so we're just going to light it up
a little bit to the face and I'm doing
their tutorial and the states that I
would do in your life and my makeup cry
always in my foundation fresh tonight
we'll see what happened cracks I do
remember that these dials will use have
a teeny bit fall out but I'm sure we'll
make it work oh and I had a very
squander
yep la look I'm going to use the
concealer on my leg just know as well
though because I don't have an H on
camera so I'm just gonna use a concealer
an or page it day and be honest I always
have the same results whether when I do
then it's always saying as long as you
lead you as a business mate concealer
and make sure you really coated it down
always okay no because it'll have a
peridot I'm going to just use to
highlight and contour pro palette I use
this time to time this is actually a new
one
because I've got another one I used to
sit and work when I worked in sorrow and
I used to use it all the time so we're
going to use best opposed oh and I'm
going to use this yellow shade here Pro
to my eyes and then I'm just going to
bring that right onto my lid and I'm
just Electric Code and under my eyes
without that and then we're do a
forehead
I cannot upper lip much in go just
foundational I'm kind of looking for but
I might just go straight and in stark
wanted in and stuff because that is what
I would usually do I'm going to go in
with the shade here this is a bit warmer
and it's quite late just to start as off
just using must submit one one two brush
yeah I really like this palette I think
it's so easy to use and it's one of the
only kind of quantity of pellets are
probably with use all these shades the
dark one maybe not on my skin tone
obviously but I could use as an eye
shadow but I just think next product
value for money is just ridiculous and
I'm just doing my usual state from going
straight on top of my foundation without
it being photos just cuz that's what I
do and it's going along really nice
pouring and now I'm going once
especially here which is just a little
step darker and asset morality so it's
more like a contour color
we'll use the first shade to
sentimentalize I need to enter the
quantum models properly but this is all
I do I like to just sharp the brush
don't either say and then I like to go
in here and loose scoop that 100 models
as well okay I'm going to swap end to my
charlotte hillbilly blush brush and then
I'm going to use that first sheet and
I'm just going to really warm up
everywhere else now I've got a really
cool illuminating powder and the shade
summer reflection and it Mac's been used
as a blush but it's what I think Annette
additions to it it's got some shimmer
and there but we focus it on the side
that Gorge that Sonic went on really
nice list now I'm going to go back in
with my yield shade in the palette it's
banana color and I'm just going to tidy
up contour a little bit I think I'm
going to go ahead and just highlight
just now so the product in videos and
going as Dore subdue this perceive gloss
Dona valence is going to ball because
I've already used some powder and stuff
but letters try it and then pattern that
end of my Beauty Blender seems to be
going on saying it's not safely to my
foundation or anything which I'm happy
about
I do like it I think I probably use this
when I've got no foundation on to meet
my skin looks super healthy and buttery
but when you're reading quite a lot of
makeup it's maybe not I actually it
looks really nice I'm not sure I'm not
sure you ever do that in this situation
but I just dead still there we go and
then I'm going to use this highlight
here and a palette let's do our nose
first so I'm just going to take a random
brush this with the Urban Decay brush
highlight for my nose down Eric Cooper
school I'm going to just take a little
bit this is actually Mex brushes part of
this away we go
kit and we get luck like that or there's
a girl just a little touch of that on
top of the Dewey part we've done see I
like that it's not too much I'm going
use a little bit close my below now I
hang on to school enter the eyes such
and probably most excited for I'm on a
neutral band not doing warm room I shall
be you'll all be built in all so the
pallets I've got here are the next
ultimate finish eyeshadow palette and of
course sugar high which is a really
gorgeous warm tone Peng keep earthly
physical electric which is blues pinks
and greens and then we have got the
smoke screen which is kind of small
clear colors but the sneezy right here
is so beautiful so we're going to use
these two I'm going to use these two
together because I do ones too great but
I want that dark navy to deepen up so
when you use these to see the pigment
and use is completely ridiculous
considering its drugstore honestly so
I'm gonna Jeff pochittona my eyes one
more time so I'm just gonna get another
powder again really push that and put
zoom you in quickie okay fellas
I'm gonna do it step by step and just
use both my eyes same thing excuse my
brushes they are your best to practice
but it's got all product offer us we're
at Sunday I'm locking my brushes today
first time but if I went with and this
blazing Matt Turk white I'm going to
start building up the crease so it's
kind of Leary developing off a crease
with a break color and but it does work
just is bet by but going side to side
and I look we're going to do today
you'll seen already in my control but we
really are really blue no grungy still
smoke so like nearly all over the lid so
I like to do the transition shade first
and then pack on and another back and
blend a little transition shoot when I'm
blending it dark color you know I mean
so I'm just going and you can see that
they're blends and
so easily like I'm so obsessed man
Seifer the place unless you can see in
that but as cat Corp it's such a
beautiful color I'm using my Smith to
see to that
there's a couple of things that I
probably wouldn't ever expected dog
store for an edge brushes and skin care
and it's just personal close friends and
I'm really lucky that I can choose to
get more high-end products but I just
think that expensive brushes are
expensive for a reason and assume of
skin care but when it comes to makeup
drugstore makeup used to be so bad
it'd just be so bad and no it's
absolutely amazing and you can get
incredible looks for super cheap and I'm
just using a brush and it's a little
just driving out to all of the focus
that once it got that on right you're
going to in a corner a little bit more
now I'm going to go straight and with
this dark maybe the mat maybe swap my
brush orbit a little bit more of a dense
brush I'm going to uses Weaver to see
for brush to fit flat brush so I can
really pick up that for that and I'm
going to tap off the excess for this one
because I don't want it full on my face
and I'm just going to paste that onto my
lid I look at that pigment it's
completely ridiculous I know that the
anastasiya subculture palette just came
out honestly one of the only reasons
that I would have bought that palette is
for a good Navy you got one right here
oh my god and it's not paid to be it'll
be the plays very obviously but it's not
going to fall apart and it just shows up
so beautifully
I'm obsessed so I'm just packing that on
and I'm going slightly over the crease
oh my god my eyes look completely
discussed in here then I'm going to swap
my brush and we'll use this mess to
force it on brush and the levy sheet
again and I'm going to start blending
that upwards into the transition shade
and I'm going to take that navy color
and a little street under my eye oh I'm
so up there and I have done the
dark I'm going to go back in to this
Gorge turquoise and I'm going to blend
that back out and then going to go all
over the need of it and just start
getting that really smooth transition
and then I'm gonna call any of the
turquoise and go under the Navy under my
eyes just to smoke gratitude and again I
say this in all my videos but I like to
do a really small key under eye because
it hides your eye bags and B it makes
your under eye last so long because
you're just packing on that eye shadow
it's not actually specifically because
it's all matte in the river Sun is
making sure that everything's blended I
really love it I'm gonna go in with the
Navy and I just like so can I take my
time to make sure that the blends are
even on both sides make sure it's nice
and packed or and nice and pigmented so
there's not going to be any too soon no
and when you go back in with my braids
palette and you can imagine how amazing
that pink would look oh maybe other pink
lipnick's let me know if you want that
and I'm actually binnacle and where's
this garage shimmery turquoise I mean
look at the beautiful words I'm going to
use a little tiny dense brush this is
the rever tooth they're a pencil brush
and
is going to pop man or coronary set as
an absolutely play it quite easily Paul
and air though and it fell it's super
trendy and cool but it's not pure like a
colorful only unicorn I'm just going to
get tweezers to open the stencils I
cannot do it with my nails so the bright
and new collection of four white Lee
knows and this is called BB photo it's a
blue and our personal water lean pencils
it brings it up like there's like shoes
which is really cute list of the blue
one it's just really really seen it
makes the eye co-op and Baines eyes up
so what were you notice I'm going to
shoot off and we do my mascara and
lashes because I'm not going to use next
for that and then I'll be back and we'll
finish everything off so right also as
we're all washed up
get them blue eyes so normally dubrow's
I'm going to use the new precision that
blue pencil from next and is the one
that's a lot longer it's got a longer
point to it and I'm going to brush
through my brows but I've actually not
used this before I really like the micro
brow pencil from next I think it's like
an exact dupe of railroads and the Robie
or by urban decay and all of those even
in the benefit one as well it's very
very similar so the shade I'm going to
use is salt ground which i think is
going to be a lot bit warm for me but
let's just see
I don't going to keep my breath quite
natural today I like em I like to find
an underneath thumb down at the front of
the actual blow and I like defining this
arch but I think what I'm going to do is
going to put some bozo through them so
you can see that the stress nice and
dark no and I think what you're going to
do is put on its side and you get these
amaz'n row here like strokes
it's actually an orchid color for me and
then I just like to use this ability to
make sure that it's brushed through
there's no harsh lines and you're build
up a product and then I'm just going to
bring up the archive
yes yes I'm and then I'm just going to
use my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel
just to seal that in place but next I've
got clear Brazil - ass that's what
you're looking for and honestly clear
brow gel like what we can you really go
wrong
nice okay I'm losing the ice washy our
guys were looking super dramatic and I
can I like it so I'm going to put these
two palettes of me honestly you saw you
saw her they work I'm going to show you
this less oil I'm never trying to
perform and cheat by it so this is
called hashtag messes everything lips
it looks like a matte liquid let's smell
good oh nice shut the glove BAM but
feels more oily obviously and then the
lipstick I've got we'll see what happens
with those but it called pinup pout and
the shade silk and it's introduced when
I saw this in the blue I am very like
doing it with pigment hood cement color
is wet late for me I think just know I
quickly collect it
I hope to nude revealed out and up or
some lip blue no yeah yeah yeah it's too
exclusive
still crazy I'd like that one be born
idol Atlanta I'm very excited about it
and I've never used it on a struggle I
bought it and it was sitting in our and
I sorta bag okay
oh my god it's so nice I have a feeling
that would run out really quickly about
their head gorgeous remove it for effect
do not would actually make serve on this
let London looks like an asset lot that
we little bit and when your London
that's much greater it was too pink
infinitely but I concealed it on my lips
if you haven't much better
you need a yell towards I think when
you're doing a blue eye refresh just use
one Jane matte lip creams and it's much
nicer ah this to show does not go with
blue eyes two minutes death baby I was
put on a little t-shirts so toxic on it
so you guys that is the finished look I
hope you like that I hope it over
deposed me for a not connect a blue
smokey eye there's not one warm brown
and st. I was really excited to do this
me properly over cause I work with
Mexico a lot you may seem a little thief
on their photos so I'm lucky enough to
work with them these are V I'm lucky to
have a lot of their product so I thought
it was really cool to sit down and just
show you that you can get a feel for use
of next makeup which is super affordable
but it is completely are actually
standard like I wish I had more neck
stuff when I worked in week apart I
think it's brilliant the things that
were probably most excited about are the
eyeshadow palettes and the foundation I
will use this foundation from the horn
like definitely I think it looks amazing
as doing enough for me it's actually not
as oily as I usually use like it doesn't
feel oily I think it's gonna last a long
time I'll update anyone on snapchat or a
people equation just like we don't want
to get back to you the only thing that I
would say for next for me doesn't make a
brand even better is the key right when
why should highlight list garage and add
the highlight actually does look really
nice but I would love to see more
highlights on them and
lashes because only thing that are doing
really lose is the lashes from there but
apart from that I am a huge fan of the
ground and yeah I really hope that you
like this tutorial and learned something
fun so you guys thank you so much for
watching this I hope you liked it and I
will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
