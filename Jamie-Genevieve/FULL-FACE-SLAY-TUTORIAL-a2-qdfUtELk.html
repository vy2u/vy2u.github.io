duty-free on the way home from New York
but this is my NARS Laguna bronzer and
I'm just trying to like finish it I hate
throwing away things I've still got like
stuff left I'm like mmm can use that
again so I'm just going with my smith
one-one-two brush I'm just going to
gently start to bronze up
and then I'm just going the usual scrap
and just going around my nose and in my
little melon forehead so I didn't feel
like Anjali weird look you can see that
they're basically this sun's coming in
my ride house and I can't film past a
certain payment afternoon I just told
you it was afternoon it's afternoon okay
I slept in and that's the God's honest
truth that's why I actually happened and
when it will end with my Kevin of corn
sculpting powder in medium this is
obviously one of my favorite things just
now see just a little touch of that
bring it back I'm going to dress this
powder underneath my eyes always and
then I'm actually going to highlight
just now as well you guys know how much
loss vehicle pulp back wall Falls
honestly it's one of my favorite
products ever it's amazing when you see
this do it really you don't you need to
work for it
so I just bring it right up my cheek and
I bring it right up to the brows way
line above all remember over could have
not done them yet and I'm just gonna get
a little 10 my nose on the go oh nice
Ellen Bert bridge of my nose I never get
this wall that's not gonna put my face I
can't tale it's like creeping over aa
tree there
Barriss up and not I'm serious maybe I
presume it's the leaks two seconds guys
okay guys thought I do apologize this is
how we're going to have to do the rest
of the video because the sun's coming in
and it's freaking me out
we're going to frozen eggs and I'm going
to show you one of them because it's
just going to take me a while because
I'm using deadblow again I'm going to go
and I'm going to do it this eyebrow and
then I'll show you how I do it this
eyebrow just because I kind of evolved
into on camera so I'm not will huh so
these pros are a little bit stronger I'm
going to bring you on UN so this pro is
slightly stronger than what I've been
doing as of late but because my original
dark em I can get away with having dark
I wrote in so I'm going to show you guys
how I'm doing this I have my medium
brown
get bro from a tostada Beverly Hills and
I've got my semester two or three brush
which is a key to doing this I brave for
sure I'm going to use my semester two
one for brush which is basically just to
smooth the spilly brush and I'm just
going to brush through that row and then
I'm going to use my little Smith 203
brush to go underneath and then parallel
line on top so if you guys again I've
been watching my videos for a little
while it's the same technique that I
used to use
and immediately that really can give
them a sharper angle and makes them look
a lot darker and it's a slightly
overdrawn my arch with blows I find it's
always easier to go around a natural
parameter of the brow and then kind of
push it out and then once I've done that
I'm going to get the brush really really
it nice and flat and sharp like a nice
sharp line and I'm going to sketch a
line for the front of the brow and then
with the excess product on the brush I'm
just going to brush that up and through
the here's this is actually a smudger
brush from as a weaver and I just like
to get that nice and sharp underneath
I'm not quite carving the mode but it's
just like tidying up that Lane and once
I've done that I'm going away with my
anastacio clear at bro Jill just to put
the breakers in place and then I'm
actually going to just meet these guys
to stand up a little bit more for the
front and that stuff is strong it's like
hair straighter your eyebrows okay and
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna finish this
eye and then I'll be back to show you
how I did it I'm totally like I'm just
watching Gossip Girl in between
recording so yeah I just like to go off
camera to see what I'm doing I actually
had no idea what I was gonna do with my
eyes today but I knew I wanted to use my
sweet peach palette the I'm sure you
guys already know they have brought this
back and it's sold out super quickly the
first time but is one of my favorites
these colors here are so lovely when I
first water are used it every day for
like a long time first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to go in with this
color here and I'm just going to mattify
my whole lids because obviously I've got
my base on it already
then I'm going to go in with the shade
Beauty which is just here with the same
brush the Mac two to four and I'm just
going to start building that up in Zeke
loose
obviously this is just a super basic
neutral look it's suitable for it
depending on your lifestyle it's
suitable for you then you can use this
to Tweel for a note makeup you can use
it for chart
/ you like I also hear a lot makeup
every day so this is like Matt kind of
everyday makeup but this is like what my
favorite looks and I'm just going back
in with that color please not on the
outside and then blend in that Ward's
then side I do like to bring my
eyeshadow quite far in here and then I'm
using the side of the brush to help
blend up towards the blue once that
colors on I'm going to go in with this
color here and summer young salmon or ah
Xing and I'm just going to build that up
a little bit more in the pieces well I'm
careful I'm not making the blend as big
so I'm being a little bit more careful
with my placement but then I'm still
going to blend that up and then I'm
going to go back in with the shade
peaches and cream which was the first
color and I'm just going to Pat that on
to the lid just to mattify that right
down
and I'm actually going to use that color
just a couple of times
underneath my just to stop any kind of
crease in through the day and that is
literally a it's a super easiest easiest
I shall do whatever but I love it it's
like my favorite everyday next I'm going
to do is the line art is a goat I don't
like that probably no I'm going to use
my Kat Von D tattoo liner and the she's
trippin favorite eyeliner ever use it
all the time and let's do this
now that's done I'm going to put some
glue on my lashes I'm sure that these
are lovely lashes and the shade boom
gone I'm sure that these are Lily lashes
and these shade can weather stunning
their super recipe I wore them before
hits I did a little bit grubby so I'm
going to glue those up first and then I
always leave them at for at least like a
few minutes to get nice and tacky the
glue that I'm using as always as the do
glue with the green right and it's the
latex-free brush-on glue s amazing now
or my gosh is this is a little bit extra
you don't need to do this the man your
mascara is absolutely Zin from Tarte so
I'm going to use that first and then I'm
going to use a different mascara on top
and I just find that this V my lashes do
not move I can get nice chunky lashes on
the ball on em and it doesn't crumble on
my feeds as well so I'm going to use
this mascara first or just little demand
your mascara itself is amazing like it
is really really good but yeah I just
went nice chunky lot nicer than a thief
thing and then I'm just using it my mad
lash mascara from the bar on top and you
can see how break those lashes all right
it's amazing honestly that's only really
like one quart of each mascara obviously
a Kangol other.we and your lashes can
end up looking quick spider de perón
tonight I don't really mean that as long
as they're not crazy junkie and I'm just
going to stick this little lash line
and then because I've used these flashes
before I'm just going to go over the
band with my liner eyeliners sisters not
twins they'll let I'm going to do is
something that I use for the first time
just other day it's the hood up beauty a
spice girl let liquid up SEC it's so
nice it's such a nice color it's nude
all this one wait till you see this and
I'm going to show you how I lean my lips
that day because I actually really like
them
when I have one quart of that color on
I'm going to actually go in with my
Urban Decay browbeat blue pencil in the
shade neutral Brown and I'm actually
going to line my lips with this all of
cause I don't really have a lip liner
this dark enough and also it's just such
a fine little tech that is really good
for it Kineton hansen issue and that
just makes it so easy to cannot finish
off the shape your lips and then I like
to difficult over all of them were cool
okay guys and that is the finished look
I'm so sorry
obsessed tutorial it was a little bit
slapdash and this is a look that I love
for every day of my life as always I
will bless all the products I've used
