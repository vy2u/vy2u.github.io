I am going to show you how to create
that Phil please glam makeup using only
remote photos me and crucial otherwise
known as coral beauty here on YouTube we
went on a remote Road checker and grass
court my home Tony so basically I got to
show her around and was really little
else what we did was we created a
framework which is much more suitable
for just like a kind of a Trinity and
then we donate a Matt Graham look so
that is what I'm really in for you today
I've got a whole bunch of our products
here including some of the new products
so I really hope you like this tutorial
and if you'd like to see her actually at
this lip stitches over town good night
okay start off I'm going to use the
present perfect primer this stuff as
companies this is where my favorite
framers of you to call I issued a lot
and then I actually lost it I go back so
this is the promote reaction makeup
primer move to that on over already done
my skin care so just put the paper on
note it smooth resurfaces radiance
mattifies and potat but at the same time
it doesn't get a totally matte finish so
you still have that connect the glue /
just feels so nice and it smells nice
and say so it's been like over coated in
it's not it's not too fragrance
next I'm going to win would be my
prediction so intuition it from Rimmel
as well that's a SPF to any invisible
coverage discipline protected skin and
the shoot I use is sausage and I'm
gluten mother of door-to-door so early
tonight and I actually had to try to
spend a until I made on durable
road trip and it lasted and the Scottish
weather
Israel so I'm gonna buff that kind of
approach
smells and everything that Dominic ever
so slightly but can you see how great
that as saw name that goes a beautiful
cover estimation tool but not Kiki at
all and then on top of that FEMA its
bill nation boy love it it's definitely
what am I going to go to drugstore for
initiative next I'm going to go n with
the max perfection concealer as the
matching concealer to the foundation nd
she steals their shape classic beige and
you have to kind of squeeze out like to
squeeze the tube get on the back of my
hand
and then it's got a little brush
attachment so I just put a product on
there and then kind of mask out we're of
highlight and some just use a knife and
I can see those are moles looking at
doing a lot about highlighting with it
as well those color is good because it's
not to tank or something to tell it's
making your little and concealer now I'm
just going to use a brush Linda I'm
using work in a patting motion rather
than kind of sweep in unseen orkney it
it keeps us all about them please and
then just kind of blend in we're just
great under my eyes once got a base on
I'm going to actually powder to snow
this is the master section of this
powder and do a little one that turns
listen I have been using this a lot
actually just recently when we really
and this is the only person I took it's
definitely in renewables it was powder
it's really even ease and kind of finely
milled it goes and computable spinach
it's not heavy at all on derive yet I
just really really like it some really
use a little brush I'm going to put
quite a quite a heavy say on the ride I
was patting that on
and I do obviously like to be but
recently I've just been to end greatly
quite a lot and para on with a brush
no thanks as well once upon that I just
kind of start to buff that into my skin
Matt makes is nice and smooth and just
mattify just in the center so still got
that glow so for my cheeks and things
but in the center Renee - Matt we can
use is going to laughs object no I'm not
going to move on to eyes from the
Linnaean three so midnight as a first
and two years of the base amounts going
to use the hide the Blue Ridge concealer
it comes in a can let's tickety-boo and
I'm just going to go straight onto my
eyes with this concealer you don't need
too much and then I'm going to blend
that and West eat connect doors
concealer brush no one started playin
joke we're just gonna go on top with a
little bit of that time to prepare art
from earlier and we're going to shape
our eyelid that is such an important
step if you want to flawless really late
will blend like eye shadow and let's do
one who's not with that Oh
so spread these slick little bc can't be
used as the magnifies palette by Rimmel
again and zero zero one keep camp and
we're gold so the first color and when
you go into is this one here it's a
really nice in a matte transition shape
we're going to start we're going to
start building that up
this season you know one deutscher
movement and then telling my brush
upwards to blend for two guys you guys
know the drill once it's on that I'm
going to go in with this shade here
which is old format and if the
convenient kanneswami's shade and we're
going to keep building up factories it's
funny this if you just let your eye
shadow at this speed I was probably just
real estate to do is create results pump
it up later always Philly if you need
help with your branding it does also
back into the later shades reduced price
and you use that at the connect help
windows darker colors okay a next date
I'm gonna start building up underneath
my eyes now so I'm going to use the
magnifies so this is the magnifies I
shall do you've got your canal eight
color here which I'm going to use lead
type I'm going to use this color here
sparks a really beautiful rust color and
when you hit underneath my hand you can
see how intense and literally just right
a lot of Lauren said it's okay just cool
and I explained that I'm going to use
the best color again in the palette and
match it and then I'm going to use the
first transition shades just to help
blend that underneath even more and then
I'm going to go back on top with the
smaller blending brush and the darker
purple shade and we're just going to
smoke that in a little touch more and
spill
now I really want to lend support so I'm
going to go back and rest this eye
shadow skill the magnified and I'm going
to pop the shimmer color all by my lower
lid I'm just using the side of the
pencil to make sure inaudible into not
going overboard
no that's fine I'm going to put a little
small brush and I'm going to go end with
this gold color here we'll just say it
that pin felt with a gold channel
certainly support even more I'm going to
hear to be scandalized to sudden micro
eyeliner ever been a different way
ah
they're delaying the further you can
slyly sometimes because it gives you
real precision as to your flex and going
to get an animation neat as well now to
smoke the wines and I'm going to take a
really tiny brush and I'm going to bloom
with the starfish color here where the
way meets the crease we're just going to
smoke that and a little bit excuse have
watched my you to turn for our quite a
while you'll remember that I used to do
this all the time I just get that really
beautiful almond-shaped eye and then
just get intensify the lower lashline
i'm going to go in with the scandalized
kohl pencil and black kohl kajal as
water to the drill you'll see how peg
into those and I always only control it
just a bit here I'll leave the inner
corners free of product just close
enough opens my eyes right up and I put
a little pop a little pop up in Oakland
pop I'm going to take the scandalized
dual pencil again I'm just going to go
in the inner corner to for that in a
corner Baretta and I'm actually going to
swap my palate to the ground eye palette
this is number two smoky bro - libros
but I feel bad soon enough and then I'm
going to go in with this can I highlight
color here we're going to pop that a
corner so we made some bright for
mascara I'm going to be using the brand
new volume sheet mascara and the whole
idea behind of Gangnam scholar is it
feels clunky for longer because you've
got this you hear that and basically
that are technology and save the mascara
that kind of freshens up the mascara and
take the chips so you don't get any
class so we're going to pop right up for
your court service
and a good tip for getting your bottom
lashes nice and chunky is using the tip
of the one and just wiggling that back
and forth underneath now moving on to
your eyebrows I'm just going to express
them through first thing I'm going to do
is we're actually going to highlight my
browbone using the highlighting color
and the glam I Charles Tyler again now
it depends on twinning is my eyebrows as
the professional growth in felt that has
been around for so long I used to use it
all the time so we're back to using less
this shoot is here so talk about mommy
parking but I I'm just making a grab for
himself and I'm going underneath and
then I'm going to go up on top and we go
underneath the front it's going to
create that nice line underneath the
front of the road and we'll use the
pencil and cute little can I hear like
strokes just at this one and once I've
done that can i top and bottom lines and
pressed it through a little bit I'm
going to swap in and use the nerve root
shake give it a little shake and it
basically as a POJO
that fills in your blows and I look to
certain so I just like to use it through
the middle part of my bro once done that
with one if you hide the blemish
concealer again and a little angle go
and we're just going to tidy up these
brows I'm going to go underneath the
front and it just gives you that really
nice sharp line make them look super
tidy and then go all the way cannot
underneath the arches will I am NOT
carbonate my entire brow I'm like to
just fix in really front part magazines
in the collect I do and then I'm gonna
go in with the row this we great feeling
deal with argan oil sweats basically
helps broken a rule as well just good as
a single great
there are eyes and are very surgeon I
just need to finish my think so the
first thing I'm going to do and I'm
going to go and winning is the 0:02
coral law and this is the remote country
and blush
Kate palette and robinette runs up first
I'm going to use the quantum parts such
a beautiful shade for quartering it's
not too warm at all now I like to just
cool Emma Jolene and on top of my
temples as well and then just inside my
nose as well using the same brush
nothing fancy
now I'm going to swap and have better
brush and use the coral blush just at
the bottom of this palette and you guys
know me I don't use too much luster so
I'm just using the tiniest little but
just to get a slight cool mature skin
I'm actually going to bring it onto my
ass apples my cheeks a lot as well
I reckon I'm a receiver bless them were
also there I'm going to take the good to
go
and as the liquid illuminator energy
she's not and he'll go
and when I fight the Eliminator using a
damp sponge onto the top of my cheeks
Amanda and we're going to up to my
temples a little bit and get this glow
and once you start get a good one
I'm going to use the highlight shade and
a key palette with a little brush and we
go on top of that liquid illuminator and
I could make that a little bit less AC
because earthquake paint color and it
settles that don't enter the skin and it
makes it look really smooth and I is no
bad

touches with lemon to it laughing
