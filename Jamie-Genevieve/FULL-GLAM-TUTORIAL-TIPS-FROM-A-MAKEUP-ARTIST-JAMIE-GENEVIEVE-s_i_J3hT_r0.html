week is very exciting so I have teamed
up with copiously and they have wanted
me to make this video in celebration of
beer one makeup artist week so basically
they have this huge campaign right now
and it's all about teaching you guys
projects top tips and basically you can
be your own niche prize
so I was really excited when it came to
me with this campaign because I was
makeup artist I am a supposedly
different you know really stop being a
makeup artist but I was practicing
makeup artist for 5 years before I
started YouTube and I was really really
excited to share with you some of my
tips and tricks so this tutorial is
going to be on this entire look it's
very old school Jamie I used to do looks
like this all the time so I was really
excited to create this look for you guys
it's going to be a little bit more
in-depth than my usual tutorials I'm
going to try and teach you guys as much
as I can about makeup and how to achieve
this look and as easy we but it go to
really amazed dramatic results it's a
dramatic makeup let's not lie that
strong cut crease that's multi-gender
and that wing all my favourite things
and one look is still coverage is
highlighted everything that I want to be
all the products I've used today can
obviously be found on cult beauty and if
you watch till the end of the video I
have a little desk angles for you guys
for copi and copii e are also causing a
competition where you could win 500
pounds worth of products which I'm not
mad before a default I'm looking if you
guys would like to see her actually add
this entire makeup artsy look simply
speeches anyone so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to do
my eyebrows the product I'm going to use
is the Anasazi at Beverly Hills Brewers
and the B shade medium broke and I'm
just going to fill in my eyebrow as
normal
I'm going to start at this one and I'm
going to create that line the whole way
around and this pencil is really good
because it fills in the little gaps on
your skin as well and I like to kind of
go slightly over on my brow shape
because we're going to clean these up
the concealer this time I'm going to go
right to the front of the road and then
we're going to do the same thing but on
the top and I'm going to start from a
boat here
same thing on the top and we're going to
pay that rate line through the tail of
the blue see how much better that looks
already
and then I'm lately going to go through
the middle section of it go make sure
there's no little gaps where the hair is
a little bit more sparse when you drop
by here and I always like to make the
arch a little bit higher and then and
think easily to break up the product a
little bit is just to use the spoolie to
brush through the brow as you know and
again make sure there's no buildup of
product in any certain areas now I'm
going to take my Kevin Aquinas skin
enhancer this is a complete set
concealer and Venini asbestos in the
shade FX or seven which is just slightly
later than my skin taut it's not too
late and I'm going to use my we bark
growling brush this is the three to two
brush and I'm just going to take a
little bit of that and put it on the
back of my hand you only need a tiny
little bit so the reason I like to use
at the back of my hand is because I use
my brush on it so you can just pick up a
little bit to product at a time and then
we're going to clean up this road so the
way I like to do that this brush is
really good for it because it's super
super strict so you can just use that
use the straight edge of the brush can
get that nice straight solid line and
then you can use the side of the brush
to kind of start dragging that toilet
don't we're actually going to use this
concealer at nine shadow base as well
I'm although the multi-purpose product
and I'm going to get a little bit more
concealer and then I'm going to flip my
hand up here and we're going to Cairo at
the top of the brow so again we're going
to use the flat edge of the brush I used
to absolutely love using this brush on
clients when I was carbonate rose it's
just the easiest thing and you can use
it flat on its side and again I'm just
kind of carving a boat from about half
an inch in and then bringing that right
go into the tail of the ribs and that's
where you get that nice sharp points now
I'm just going to use this little pencil
and just create little hairlike strokes
at the very front is to make
a little bit silly then I'm going to go
end with the concealer buffer brush this
is one for two by the Weaver I again
blend that into my skin and then onto
the lid no I don't use too much on the
lid I just use enough to get a nice
coverage so you can't see any of our
pigmentation on one Street and the best
brush in the back of my hand again and
then we're going to go right over the
lid because the stuffs autarky actually
actually acts as a really good eye
shadow base now that we've done that I'm
going to go to street and with this
poster this is one my favorite favorite
favorite produce it's a Charlotte
Tilbury ear brush flawless finish skin
perfecting my composure and there she is
- which is medium and when it takes
about that I'm going to set the lid and
that is perfectly mattified and it's
ready for that shot now just to save the
brow I'm going to end up with my
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel this is
probably one of my favorite clear
bridges on the market
I used to use it all the time and then I
decided I needed to try a couple other
ones but there's always will be one my
favorite and because it's clear you can
actually use this and you're here you
can use it to kind of smooth it baby
here if you're doing a really slick pony
to use this just to get the edges of
your here super slick back it's just far
it's almost like it can I hear Spri
texture pretty hard and crunchy on the
roads but it does keep the glow here's
and please all do I'm just brushing the
frontiers upwards and then I'm just
continuing there here's to the bloat and
their normal position and that supposed
to same philosophy sector growth moving
like eyeshadow I'm actually using the
Royal applause through eyeshadows this
is what it looks like really gorgeous
palette this is actually my fresh paint
movement but once to try it for so long
and then when I thought Nicole Beauty
website under the air this is what I
wanted to use and I am super impressed
Cyprien player so I'm going to go in
with my Weaver luxe soft definer brush
this is brush number two to seven and
Rabbinical end with the shade transition
first which is this one right here
and we're going to do it exactly that
we're going to build up her transition
so I'm just going to go and the keys
first if you guys have watched my
channel for a little while you'll know
how much I love the deliever brushes
they are sorta forwardable
but they are completely professional so
I'm just building up that transition you
can see the pigment fire it goes line
source smoothly there's no chalk in air
it's just a really easy easier a shadow
to use and I'm all about that like I'm
bringing that right end so that a
coroner if you look here up or the dark
great a mentor corner so I can create
that nice deep cut crease and then I'm
going to use the brush on it so you just
start winging that share the work now
I'm going to go n would be shade called
hashtag which is gorgeous
or in color and we're going to do the
exact same thing now I'm swapping over
to my 2 to 8 luxe crease brush and we
will end up with these shades kvb R
which is a really gorgeous deep kind of
Kwame Brown and we're going to start
building actually show up so starting on
the outer corner and bring in that right
end and I always like to go back in with
my other eye shadow brush the 2 to 7 and
just use that to diffuse the darker tone
into the transition shade you can even
use a little bit all the transition
shade to help blend just taking a little
bit support that I'm placing them on the
lid and then blend in and then using the
transition shade again when you need to
it's all about it just building up the
colors but by that you guys know I love
this brush it's did two to four from
zareba
and I'm going to go straight and with
the shade KB beer and then wood under my
eyes snatch don't have any planar or
concealer or any kind of my eyes and I'm
just going to use the natural oils in my
skin to start building that up and then
I'm going to start using the 2 to 4 to
build crease up a little bit more
reflective deBeer color and then I'm
going to use a teddy bear color and
start to go onto the lid
a corner that right there like my
favorite grungy I look you already know
now I'm going to go I'm appreciated
crystal which is just here in the
coroner at some really gorgeous
highlight color and the trophy for Lux
smoky shader brush and we're going to
highlight the browbone right now you can
see that pigments really to Lou I'm
going to bring that into the inner
corner it's a little touch more the
darker shade teddy bear now I'm going to
cut the crease and the way I do that
it's pretty easy but the most important
part is this brush here is the two to
six smudger brush by the Weaver is the
perfect shape for just place them in the
crease and drag and down and you get
that perfect coxy straight away so the
product I'm going to use to cut a crease
is actually the foundation I'm going to
use so this is the Baker ultimate
coverage complexion cream I used to use
a foundation all the time Jordan little
Y of salt I think I was trying out other
things but I'm actually going to take a
little bit of that on the back of my
hand and the foundation is super
different Maps so that's why I'm using
it it's really really matte it dries
down really nicely as well and I'm just
going to place the brush or I'm going to
take some of that product I'm going to
place the brush on and I'm going to just
mimic the other side so I just follow
the crease angle slightly higher
and then on to the LED a little bit as
well and then I like to use the
concealer buffer brush just to cannot
smooth out a little bit into the
eyeshadow you see how easy that was it
was literally to me terrific and it
makes that idea of dinner capture you
saw much less daunting easy-peasy
so now we're going to take our eye
shadow smoky shader the 234 brush and
we're just going to set that with thanks
a lot e which is the can is kind of like
the shoe that you would use to mattify
your primer and we're just going to pack
that on top of the foundation to make
sure it's all suits and we're not going
to get anything slipping around
so as you wants to stick for a matte cup
case you would start right here but I've
been dying to try this product and a
family tried it today it's the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glue I
shadow so I just give it a little shake
and we're going to apply this directly
onto the Coxes portion arriving cup all
that how beautiful is that I will say so
I just cannot keep my paws dry off a
little bit and then I'm going to use the
same brush I used to mattify down just
to kind of settle that product down at
the end just so there's no harsh line
when it ends and the match title begins
and then I'm just going to kind of
roughly Pat that and it's cuz it helped
it dry quicker how produced it come on
you yeah a lot of type I've got for you
for the cut crease is if you take a
really really teeny tiny fine liner
brush and City one side by the Weaver
and heavy beer which is the dark shades
you can kind of go in through the cut
creases and just darken the shadow part
and it can make the contrast a lot bit
more it's all using I'm going to just
take my little petite crease brush
4-2-3-1
and shade crystal again and I was going
to pop mine our coroner I calculate is
nice and dry
I'm going to go in with my leaner the
later I'm going to use is the next epic
and cleaner you'll see me use the four
million times is one of my favorite
liners because it's got that really
really gorgeous brush tip which just
makes it really really easy an artistic
brush so it's really easy to get that
nice defined flick and yeah I'm going to
just try and make this one a similar
focus I'm going to start an inner corner
really nice and thin and a little tip
for you I would start Nathanson and the
second part of the liner is right here
at the end of my eye and then I was
paper out to make that flick that is a
really really easy quick way to make
your eyes with more almond shape it is
really flattering and it basically meet
your eyes look bigger let's do this and
then I like to judge the length of my
wing by looking at the tail of my brow
so you can see that it comes out a teeny
little bit further than the tail of my
brow now we've got a little bit
fine-tuning to do but what I did there
was I keep my eye open when I draw up
the lane from a flick and then I keep it
open when I'm dragging it back and that
way I can see exactly what kind of shape
is going to look like on my eye okay I'm
happy enough with that way in the moment
I'm going to split up my lashes put on
my mascara and then we'll have a look at
it when it's done the lashes I'm going
to use are the hood up beauty file
lashes again these are last as I used to
wear all the time some very comfortable
with them and I'm just going to take
these full and my check for lashes or
make sure you cut them short enough so
my lashes accident start until them we
in here and that way they're just really
comfortable they're more kind of focus
on the outside of the eye that can a mix
it how about beautiful can almond shaped
also I cut off most of it from the ends
but I actually cut off a little bit from
end plate as well just to make sure that
they're super long and slovaks I like
quite a dramatic lash and my biggest tip
for lashes is to glue them up the Freder
your mascara make sure you're putting on
your lash glue and then you just sit
them down somewhere the natural curve of
the lash well lit and sit pretty happily
on top of the crater
put them behind me and then attainments
it for your lashes to dry you can do
your fill mascara and sometimes even
start your lips and that is pretty much
make sure that the last of a nascent
hockey when you're putting them on
you're not going to have to stay with
them to set the modern estimate that I'm
going to year's roller lash by benefit
mascara the reason I picked this one as
the cause it's got a really nice curved
wand which I really like for my bottom
lashes and because I realize every day I
don't really need to worry about how
thick my top lashes are but I do like to
make sure that my bottom lashes are nice
and thick and long and black the little
thing I've got here is called a lash
star so this is like a large applicator
and it is my favorite type of tweezer so
I'm going to take my lash and put my
tweezers and little applicator and I'm
going to place the lash from outside of
my eye and now these lashes are
synthetic which means that they're kind
of a lot with tougher to put on the
band's a little bit thicker hand why I
really like using these when I'm
wheeling liner is quite difficult to get
these stuck rate on without some liner
just to can I hide through the lash tip
phenomena and it just makes them set
super close to the natural lash line and
just set your folks and that is I finish
of the minute though that the finisher
I'm going to move on to skin my favorite
part the first thing I'm going to do I'm
going to prep my skin and I'm going to
use my tightest heliotrope pick
sunscreen and primer so this is SPF 30
recently I have found out how important
as duplicate your skin every single day
even if you live in Scotland and the
weather's are back and you live abroad
or in America is where there's mostly
maize and definitely you should be using
APA the reason I like this is it leaves
no white cast it is super silky and
smooth and makeup goes on top so
beautifully so I'm going to take some of
this and we're just going to rub that
into my skull a little forehead as well
obviously if you guys are doing your
makeup a whore you feel free to put this
on for you do eye makeup as probably a
little bit easier but you need to be
making sure that your reason that from
screamed
potential skiing now renascent protected
i am going to go end with the fresh
valley rules golden elixir 24 karat gold
infused beauty oil now i've used this a
couple times and I really do like it I'm
a huge fan of oil I think that they
completely change the way that condition
and skin makeup sets and face so I'm
going to take bit four drops of that
drop it into my hand push that into my
skin so we're looking at nice and glowy
and borderline oily and the reason I
love using oil so much is because I like
to use in a full coverage foundation and
it is very easy for fill coverage
foundations to look cakey on the skin
and that is what we are when I avoid at
all cost
now like I said earlier at the
foundation I'm going to use is the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion cream two
pumps onto the back of my hand I'm going
to apply that with my finger and little
dots on my skin the color I'm using is
the shade knit it's perfect for me it
was my little little town up up Gordon
so put that little dots all over my face
and it's just going to help us get a
nice even coverage and I've raised a
little bit over the back of my hand
just in case I need it I'm actually
going to go in with my oil again I'm
going to take a little dropper of that
and I'm going to put it directly onto my
Beauty Blender a bit five drops I'll
guess up one two three four five on the
face and we're going to start blending
this foundation in and I absolutely love
this technique because it makes the
foundation look so gorgeous and really
and even though I'm getting that full
coverage I'm going to bring up their
money a little bit I like to go over my
lips because I do like the natural
pigmentation or thumb I'm being careful
arrey my brows and then I'm using a
Beauty Blender just to blend that into
my hairline and not only does the oil
kind of out the foundation but it
gives it a beautiful bonus it's
naturally not really in that foundation
foundation itself quite matte now I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the
tiniest little bit on my camera quad
concealer put that on the back of my
hand we're going to work off the back of
answer that and we're going to highlight
under your eyes and then we're also
going to highlight keeping for the chin
and forehead now obviously this is
adding quite a lot coverage I actually
love having loved the coverage and I
love having shared renditions as well
but today just feel comfy okay and then
I'm going to really carefully blend that
right underneath my eyes just using the
side of a beauty blender and that as a
super dramatic now I'm going to use the
105 lot highlight brush or match the new
proposed oh and I'm just going to powder
under my eyes and iqs patting motions
first and then sweep and you'll see that
that just makes the highlight very nice
and natural but also produce at rate
those and that my friends is a
long-lasting under-eye I'm going to do
the same thing to the center leave us a
message and I'm leaving okay to my skin
nice and dewy and fresh now I'm actually
swap back into my eyeshadow palette and
use the shade hashtag with my luxe soft
definer and we're going to run that
underneath our eyes and that's going to
make our eyeshadow blend right into our
foundation
it also mattifies the concealer just one
more time time to add some definition to
the skin again so this as the bear car
sunchaser color and inside it's got a
gorgeous blush my opal highlight which
is my favorite and really nice ones as
well and I read tons really good reviews
on this hand prior quarter and we're
going to use this to kind of bronze and
highlight and add some definition to the
skin so the first thing we do is we take
my Charlotte Albany blusher brush this
is one my favorite brushes for doing
that and we will end with the blinds our
first and I'm just going to brush that
Mantar face and I'm just going down my
cheekbones and then Le Pew's make
circular movements just to bring that up
to my cheeks the forehead as well this
palette is for ideal for tile and it's
the easiest so under my jaw as well and
diamond X make sure everything to tie in
nicely and then I'm just going to do the
same back brush and just a a little
touch of those just doing the same
obviously we've used pretty real
coverage foundation so I just want to
make sure my nose does get lost in my
face now I'm going to go in with the
little blushes so I should see that this
is I think it's just patting sensitive
this is a Scott Lawson apricot blossom
and full pulse so I'm going to go in
with the apricot blossom I'm just going
to put the tiniest little touch of that
just above our blinds oh and then I'm
going to go in it with the lock code
refusion brush this is where my spirit
is Weaver brushes and we're going to end
with the awful highlight or you just
can't beat the my favorite highlight of
all time and because this brush is so
tiny you can get that nice precision on
where your highlight and and then I'm
just going to do a little touch above
the brow and then I'm going to swap to
my little locks pencil brush this as the
tooth fairy brush from zoeva 10 mana
north and then just do this teeny little
thin line during the very firm terminals
as well all helps you keep the book the
electronic fluid or actual products I
have used before and I really like so if
there's the Charlotte Tilbury let's
cheat lip pencil in the shade iconic
notes and this is the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick and caramel so I'm going
to lay my lips first and the way that I
like to do that is I cannot clean off my
lips on the back of my mind a little bit
because I do like to cover them as
foundation and I'm going to start my top
lips to do I'm going to draw a little
kind of V shape and then I'm just going
to continue and do the rest my lips so
the reason I like the sweatpants are so
much is because it's called cold lips
cheap and the reason is called that is
because it's so good for over door on
your lips so if you like to over draw a
little bit or a lot whatever and a
really nice texture and it almost looks
like wet texture so it doesn't look like
what liner everywhere it's super natural
and it's just a fab color as well I love
it so now we're in nice and early I'm
going to apply my liquid lipstick and
then way that I like to do this
straight from at the bullet and then
I'll excited over a finger
so you guys that is the finished look I
really really hope you like it was so
much fun for me to create that I do just
feel like the old Jamie this is the
