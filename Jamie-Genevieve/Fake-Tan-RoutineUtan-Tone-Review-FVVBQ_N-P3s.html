we are doing something different yet
again and I am nervous cause Jack's
watching me huge should you please go be
the bedroom go lie in bed and watch her
fall I am it's what we were going to do
today as I have teamed up with you turn
so your turn and torn is a fake tan it's
been reformulated and they are
relaunching it as well the research me
and the will they send me some stuff and
and I tried it and it is the best it is
genuinely the base Pete kind of her I
was golden brown and it's not hard
because I'm useless with feet kind so
it's not difficult it's not difficult to
do so that's what we're going to do
today is I'm going to show you how I use
it I'm not actually going to show you
how I use it because that involves me
being naked and pulling all sorts of
Konoe gymnastic moves to reach different
areas of my body so we're not actually
I'm not going to show you but I'm going
to tell you how I fit time how it lasted
me so long and I'm going to tell you
some key benefits or these products and
then also how to make it work for you
depends on what's going to when you've
got and the first thing that is really
important if it can is that you need to
look after your skin so I have been
having baths and I've been exfoliate and
in the bath and it's fully dripping
using as the body smoothing before scrub
which is one of you times products it is
just a really really nice scrub it
smells amazing and it's more it's like
really finely milled if you know what I
mean so it's really scrubbing
yesterday's actually lovely and it also
says it's got all the fruit oil sweet
orange oil smooth and chamomile and it's
got that minty and C so which are all
good for your skin so I've been using
that the last couple days the next thing
that I do is that I moisturize my skin
so you can just use whatever moisturizer
you've got something that's good to use
ere is the lotions so you can get
gradual glow everyday lotion which is
obviously it's just like a body lotion
you put it on and after exfoliating your
skin you can
stop hi it with your hands if you want a
boy if the Piper's much always make sure
you wash your hands after the palm of
your hands and in between your fingers
or if you're 110 to go quite dark quite
quickly you can use the weekly sales tan
which is the lotion so this one is a
medium lotion so it's not actually that
dark so you could use this first way
until the next day and tell you how a
strong color and then you can put on the
stuff I use to get super dark so what I
would do is I would exfoliate for a
couple days moisturize make sure my skin
is super soft shave your legs shave your
armpits whatever else you want seep and
just because you want to be nice and
smooth for putting your tan one now
there are two options
I've lost the lid on one of them so I'm
going to just take the lid off the other
one as well there's two options as to
what time you use you can use so this is
the feet time I use is the framing body
dark lotion so this is the lotion that
you put on it's the one that people
usually wear and this one is you put on
you let it dry for a few minutes and
then you allow four to six hours for it
to veil to develop I usually put on late
at night so for example you go for a run
live shower after I recorded this part
of the vlog and then I'm going to apply
it and then I would go to bed and then
in the morning average your strength off
just with water and and then what's
latest is my color so that's one year
you wake up in your brain and then when
you wash off you see that color whereas
if you don't like sleeping in fake tan
and you don't like putting it on for too
long what you could use is the 40-minute
time so basically what you do you can
leave it on for 40 minutes for a golden
glow 18 minutes for a sun-kissed tan 3d
plus arrows for deep bronze what you
would do in that case as you could leave
it for 40 minutes wash off and then it
continues to develop for up to 24 hours
afterwards so you will get progressively
darker if you want to go super super
dark you can put one coat of this on and
then 15 minutes later put another cool
and then you can leave it for the three
then wash it off and I really like this
for when and planning in the morning
because I can wash it off in Engel room
by D I like to turn an 18 about it's my
favorite so if I remember correctly then
of what I would do is I would tan at
nighttime wash this off in the morning
and then nights weekend for the rest of
my life because it does not come off
it's amazing so the times that I've used
this time before it there is like no
feeds to the tan at all in for a good
whale anyway it does start to obviously
come off it doesn't go flaky it doesn't
go pili as long as you look after your
skin what you can do is you can just
keep on moisturizing your skin after
your tan has been on for a couple of
days so I'll just put a little
moisturizer on or you can do if you want
to keep your turn up as you can use one
of the lotions and then use one of the
moisturizers that has pan in it just to
keep it up and keep it nice and smooth
my plan is I'm going to go for sure and
I'm going to take up all my makeup off
and then I'm going to meet you back here
and I by then I left on my body and then
I'm going to show you how I fake tan my
face yes everyone looks like this when
they go the shower ok so I'm probably
pretty careful because I don't want my
boob to fall in this video but what I've
done is I've moisturize my hands and my
elbows and my feet and my knees and I
have my met here so this is just a tarp
met that correlate use in and I'm going
to use one pump at a time and then just
whack it up so it's pretty dark from the
gate ball so it's good you can see that
with what you're doing and then I just
use circular motions up and down I kind
of blamed the end to my wrist at first I
don't go right over my hands as I don't
do my hands until very laughs and I'm
just going to continue this process all
over my body and then to do hands once
it's on there is my body I take what's
ever left on the mat and then I'll just
blend it down and then I'll do the size
of my fingers and save my fingers and
then just repeat that process through my
whole hands go over my knuckles in mind
fingers bent like this so it feels like
there's not much going on to be honest
but I know I know there is always
whenever I used to use fake time when I
was like I used to always wake up with
orange hands so this is definitely the
best way for me and then at the end of
it all what I'll do is I'll go and I'll
just get my hands of you rental water
anyway because I've actually got some on
my finger here nightmare so once I am
success late and I see successfully
let's give it over night until we see
throughout the whole work dope
anyway what I'm going to do is I'm going
to grab my guitar now a medium so that
stuff is pretty hard to get I'm not
gonna lie I know that they've just
restocked tons of stuff so I'm sure
they'll have it in stock but obviously
as always I'm going to link everything
down below and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make certain a little
pattern on here in wess mine wash out
and then imaginal gonna paint over the
paintbrush so you're going to see that
only it's false it out so I covered up
before but there's no hiding it now in
what I'm going to do is I've got a next
brush here is the all you brush and it's
just like a really nice a gel fiber
brush and I'm actually going to mix the
tan so that's why I was great at what
you do is this you push down and you
only need one pump to be fair so I'm
going to actually hang a little bit the
tan I used that says my favourites hand
so probably two parts moisturizer to one
part time and I'm just going to mix that
together on the lid I don't know if
that's what it's made for but this is
why I like to use it for and then I'm
literally painted my face so you really
don't need much of it at all and I'm
messing my brows out hey I just got my
hair done and it's darker at the roots
which is great because when I used to do
this with blonde here it was a little
bit risky and then a few ones have
actually going on all over I will use my
hands just to rub it in but I just love
this this tip makes me happy then I'm
just gonna use mind then I'm gonna blend
that down my neck but I've got tan
anyway so it's up to you if you were
makeup everyday like me you don't
actually have to turn your face but if
you do like to leave the house without
make up on then it's quite nice to be
what put subtitle your feet I'm just
gonna blend out with my ears a little
bit as well just so you can leave the
house and mostly Matt I'm really I've
gone very rude because I've loved my
face but I'm fully aware of that but I'm
going to wash my hand and I'll be back
in two SEC's
so I've obviously big camera body and
this is just a Jason gain or would you
call it
I rub an eighth rib at night going there
you go this is an eighth go this is just
a black make going from ear next it's
just there really makes late Jason good
and I actually like to sleep in this in
after done my fan just to make sure that
nothing gets my sheets but that's like I
said this town doesn't really transfer
it anyway and so ya know that's all life
to do is to go to sleep wake up tomorrow
and then your name wash it off so I will
see you guys kiniry oh I just woke up
Spanish and I don't think I did a very
good job in this town a city because I'm
I was tired but as always I woke up and
it's perfect
now to wash it off my body and then I'll
show you what it looks like so much
about em ignore my sports because it's
not good eBay so but I didn't put an
awfully kind of my face I don't think
because in this late and it's okay but
in a football my face looks a lot paler
so I will it in a for things after I put
one a little bit foundation I thought I
would show you how lovely and even this
planners so photometers hopeless if a
time as me I think I did not bad I'm
gonna put a little bit makeup and then
I'll be back to Tilly's work and fought
on the turn etc so that is me with my
makeup on obviously with the tan I
actually quite like to wear like your
makeup so not as much on I use just a
little bit of shadow liner and lashes
and then I'm using one of the Anasazi
liquid lipsticks this one's called
stripped and it's one of my future
colors at the moment so that's what it
looks like and normal daylight is super
tanned and when I wear fake tan I like
to wear more kinda like strappy brows it
was one of the Calvin Klein one it is
just super comfy and there's no there's
no like
male class for anything to rub on the
tan so it's really really comfortable it
doesn't give much in the way of support
but will is actually beautiful today so
I'm happy that's all my feet turnin
because I'm going to feel much better so
I like to put a little bit of white as
well because it obviously contrast to
the tan and the other than that I'm just
reading a Greek in a maxi skirt from
River Island and in a week a Couture
from hot shop with my foundation and
things like that I obviously have an
abundance of foundations so I have
really dark Pines eye mechs so today
I've actually got a mix of the Bear Cat
a wire sale and a really dark concealer
from the new to face collection so it is
nice and full coverage but it matches my
body perfectly which is what we want and
what I recommend if you only have one
foundation that's your color what you
can do is you can go into a shopping
center or like a Debenhams or something
like that and going to color match that
account or when you've got tan on I hope
you guys liked this video like I said
and hopefully I have all the information
that you guys need a fake tan and
something that's relatively new to me
and but I thought because I found this
town so easy surely people would find it
easy if you have any questions at all
please do comment down below and ask
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
write a brief summary of all the kind of
hints and tips that I give you guys and
I'm going to put them in an infobox down
the law along with links etc oh you guys
like this connect definite style of
video please let me know what you think
