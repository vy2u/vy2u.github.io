we are going to do i and electorial or
in that by autumn winter makeup I'm
really sorry I called this that you fall
because in Scotland we don't call it
fall
I call it on autumn autumn and then they
say I am good to do this look we're
gonna do a super is pretty glam to on
it's double dark obviously so it's my
tech and full makeup so this is probably
a little bit too heavy for you guys will
know actually that sort resume shows
what if you love the makeup like me this
you could probably get away with just in
the eyes and a good light love that life
or you could just do the dark light and
how they it cannot do di but I love
pavements again I'm just going through
it if you'd like to see how I created
this look stitching okay let's start
with this I as always full of beans I'm
going to shove on soft ocher they met
all the goodies and I'm just going to
use the Real Techniques base shadow
brush so because these brushes are
synthetic the cream product on it really
nicely so I'm just gonna buff that and
as always right up to the concealer that
I've put one underneath my brow and
underneath as well I think the key to
this product is just to use a small
amount if you use too much then increase
for this look I'm going to use that
Anastasia Beverly Hills shadow creature
world traveler palette so as majestic to
say the least and the color when you use
first is just the soft peach which is
the lightest shade in the palette and
I'm going to use they're all over my
keys so using the sugar pedal a tapered
blending brush this brush was and my
favorite brushes ideal and I always
reach for a day for one of my favorites
I'd really like to get some water
actually from these from this brand but
I'm just using kind of sweeping motions
and I'm buffing that right off into the
concealer underneath the brow as well
and then just
start off underneath the eye okay come
on up and then I'm going to use that
underneath the eye to start off my eye
makeup as well this looks come out this
looks quite dramatic so I'm bringing the
transition color right up to just
underneath the eyebrow the only way to
go in with the same brush and this color
here which is called Morocco which is
just the most beautiful warm Brown I've
ever seen in my entire life
it's really is that I were just gonna go
work on top of the crease again but
we're not going to go as high as a
transition shade again the similar
emotions with the brush just kind of
soft sweeping motions and I'm not
putting too much product on at a time
here because I want to be quite clear
with my placement of the product I'm
going underneath it as well pretty smoky
underneath this look I was so shiny I
absolutely adored it guys I'm so excited
my mum and dad have been away on holiday
for two weeks and they get back today
I've missed them so much thing with my
mom now I'm going to work on top again
with fudge I'm going to swap my brush
over I'm going to use the Smith 230
brush but she is just really really
beautiful your ass and we're going to
just go in with that cheese fudge right
into the crease the Pegman in these eye
shadows is a beautiful and you really
don't need that much product at all when
you're working a little bit goes a long
way and I'm gonna go underneath as well
I'm going quite far in here I'm just
gonna walk back to my sugarpill brush
and blend the edges of that dark holiday
I can with my smooth brush I'm just
connect slowly building up that color
just so it matches other states I do
norther this lick is pretty dark retorts
get in there a good tip if you feel like
your blends in
your dark colors be a bit too dark if
you're going to see this shade later and
use that to kind of dull it down a
little bit that works Lourdes I was
using my brush just to kind of wing
their say a little bit it's not a wing
don't look it's quite a rounded loop I
just want my eye shadow to kind of taper
it off just like that on the other side
as well for the next thing I'm gonna use
intense goose what is it
intense gaze off the pallet and I'm
gonna pack that on to the lower lid use
a little illamasqua eyeshadow brush this
is just such a beautiful kind of color
right there this is just a really
beautiful pinky toned color that I used
as a bead so I know this is Kate you
clean off very full of me like using
brains and paints but so right you're
just using that color all over the lower
lids and then I'm gonna kind of just my
brush off and we use the same brush and
I'm gonna go in with pink champagne from
the palette that sighs shouts always
kind of like the only one in the palette
that has some really coarse sparkle
through it I'm just going to use that
and my inner eye and a corner for the
next thing I'm gonna use to fix shadow
insurance glitter bunting eyeshadow
primer that's thing it is I mean science
all I do is I take a little bit just a
teeny tiny bit and I'm gonna use my
metal finger and I'm just gonna place
that on my lids with my finger I'm just
gonna dust it out all over benefit the
pink
why because you're using your finger
it's actually really evenly distributed
very handy to do and then I'm going to
use Mac
gold reflux glitter beautiful that's
what it is actually and I'm just gonna
use a fluffy brush to place that on if
you want to be in love with your eye
this is this tape that will do now I'm
gonna go back in with my Smith brush and
I'm gonna go in with noir from her
palette which is the black it's only
black in the palette and I'm just going
to intensify my crease a look better and
they will carry on underneath her
and then I'm going to go back in with my
sugar pill and a little bit of Morocco
which is the warm brain shade I'm just
going to smoke that I'm going to go back
in with the brush I use for the plane
right and I'm just going to soften out
the top
nextly concealer that's why I absolutely
love using concealer under the brain
because if you make a nose like I do
every day you can kind of use your
concealer to kind of almost arrays
mythix and then when I go back and with
the warm shades and I'm just gonna
buffer that Elaine that's doing my hair
then I'm gonna go in with mascara best
look has no lino and the mascara I'm
using is just the Lancome Hypnose the
new one and I don't like using light now
sometimes because I just when you will
look down with your last I just want it
to be spot colors when it to be gold put
that mascara on as usual
oh I forgot about that forgot that for
that you've heard me talk about knobbler
before this is not velvet Lane black eye
pencil this is just a totally matte
black eye pencil and it stays all day so
we're gonna put that in the waterline
after I get this eyelash in my eye
sick make a wish that's so much better
and then I'm just gonna kind of drag
that down in between the lashes no I'm
gonna go back into the scatter because
I'm ready for that and I'm gonna mascara
the bottom lashes lashes I am using for
this look right there Eldora in ueno
true they are double zero two and
they're kinda havior out in the corner
which is it nice if you've done a wig
like Steve if we were kind of we're kind
of focusing on that eye makeup rather
than like a flickering like we're kind
of doing a grown to die but if you still
like that cat eye look you can get that
by just use and flick those eyelashes
the glue you get with your daughter
lashes is absolutely stunning if anyone
knows for to buy glue it's like can I
lick got a blue hue through it and then
it
is clear they could rise really
translate like electric blue and then
it's like you can't get it off please
let me know because I have to use Lily's
little guys like one every two days and
I can't afford that many eyelashes
I am skin room dry now I thought putting
it on so it's really important to get
the lashes coolest of lash line as
possible just so it gives that kind of
seamless look like they're just my own
double beautiful lashes I was born
release were you talking about
they're mine what that's that is done
now let's move on to lips start off I'm
gonna use costo riche pencil by Mac
which is just a really beautiful matte
Brown yes I'm using a brown and I'm just
gonna hit laying my lips out as usual
that'll do not gonna get it over I'm not
very good at Lena maths but I get just I
get there and then lipstick I'm putting
use is it Ken by Illamasqua this is part
of their new Christmas range no not not
this is part of their newest range
collection earth I'm just going to pop
that on up with the bullet
lips are done and obviously when you're
doing a dark library it's always nice to
go around the perimeter with concealer
just to tidy up
and that is the finish that case I hope
you like it I hope you like the look
I've created for you
I absolutely love all the products I
used today especially that Anastasio
palette and I love that pencil is Weldon
a blue velvet Lane like pencil
absolutely faced with that so yeah I
really hope that you like this and I
hope I see people out there by rocking
their double dark look for fall I'll be
