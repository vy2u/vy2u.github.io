today we are going to do this skin look
so I'm going to take you through exactly
how I I pray my face how I do my
foundation how I contour highlight and
then I'm going to throw up stick on at
the end so I'm really excited cause I'm
actually going to be cream contouring
today and I'm going to show you a really
easy way to do it I'm going to show you
is that the whole ie
which is a cream contour palette and
this skin is saw photographic so if
you're going out it's perfect and it's
heavier than usual for me and it's kind
of like when I used to do my makeup in
the old days it's okay if you'd like to
see how I create my skin like please
stay tuned so I've always laid on my
eyes already and my eyebrows so we're
just going to go straight into skin so
to prepare my skin I'm going to use my
Mario Badescu spray with Harris and I
actually talked about that in my
skincare video as of late and I really
love it
next is obviously my Bobbi Brown face
base that's really really really nearly
ran out at this time but it's okay I
have a cotton bud so I'm just going to
get but oh so the skin look I'm going
for it really really glowy because I'm
going to be using cream as well as
powder and it keeps the look really
really perfect it's gonna look really
nice I did it yesterday and I was
obsessed so if you don't know about this
Bobbi growing fear space you need to
because it's best and I use it every day
I love it
next is primer and I'm going to use the
hangover XP merit from Too Faced I am
nearly ready notice actually it's a
really nice texture and it's got tons a
coconut lip so it smells amazing it
smells really fresh and and it's so
nourishing so I've been using the Bobbi
Brown face piece with us on top of that
for like a good month or something
though and
seems to work the bass they were going
to stop tried the next thing we're going
to do is foundation and I'm going to be
using the born this way to face
foundation so this foundation I've
actually not used on camera yet but I
have been using it a whole lot and I
really am and I really really like it
actually and it goes really nicely on
top of that framer I can do like a pump
and a half on my Smith one one five
brush and then a step load all over
first the color I'm using as late beige
I really really like this one do - no
actually and it wears the bill through
the day really nice coverage it does not
look cakey whatsoever I was really like
it and the reason I did my brows my eyes
first is because today I've got a little
bit of clutter on the go and that falls
on your face straight away if you don't
do your eyes first it'll just stick to
your foundation and and I just wanted
this tutorial to be like skin focused so
next thing I'm going to go in with is
shape tip by Tarte
is by far my new favorite concealer it's
sort nice and I'm just going to use that
under my eyes
and notice I'm leaving quite a big gap
between my eye makeup and eye concealer
and I'm going to go down my nose and
then onto my forehead as well and I'm
just going to blend that in again with
my smooth brush so I like to use kind of
dabbing motions first
well I'm going to dry underneath my eyes
as I'm just going to grab my little real
techniques brush and that's how I keep
my eyes really smoky underneath the for
a powder under my eyes I'm going to
clean pointer so I'm going to use that
iconic of London and multi-use
concealing sit and when I first saw that
I was really taped by the shield right
here because it is super actually but
it's still not too dark which is great
so I'm actually going to use this first
and I'm not going to map out my face I'm
going to just use it and like build up
so I'm going to go in with the shade
here first and my Real Techniques
contour brush and I'm just going to
start at the back of my face next to my
ear
and I'm just using the brush to get a
nice kind of Lane almost where I want my
contour to set and then I'm buffing that
line upwards and then once I've done my
teks I like to use the cream product on
the forehead and when you use cream
products to contour and highlight once
you set the my powder
Eddie lasts a really long time so your
skin will last all day but also in
photos it looks beautiful it looks
really nice give it a little bit more
dimension and I'm going to go in with my
Smith one to four brush but although
it's double Jamie and which is the
contouring nose brush pretty much and
when one with that same shade and I'm
just gonna and then I'm just going to
use the side of that brush to smooth
and then I'd like to do a little bit
just at the tip of my nose or so
so that's works for my nose shape and if
you're struggling I'm not a knowledge
contour expert at all if you just look
up on Google what type of noise you've
got and just put contour it in and it
will show you a really nice way to
contour your nose but this kind of works
for me
I'm gonna put that down a little bit
because it's quite heavy I'm going to go
in with a slightly warmer shade here and
we're going to just pop that on top of
our contour inner cheats
so we've it warmer so it kinda helps
with the transition man I love this and
then I could just use my foundation
brush it because it screams you can
really easily just move the product
around
okay let's highlight some so Matt you're
just going to go in the same brush and
because I've only been using really let
amount of the product at a time and
we're going to go in with the lightest
shade right here and I'm just going to
get a little bit that product and I'm
just going to step alit on to my
cheekbones under my eyes
and I'm going to blend that in as we go
so I think the most important with this
kind of look is to make sure that you
are blending and I find out a lot easier
to build it up like this than to draw
all out and then blend out and then I'm
just going to put that highlight right
in my forehead Thanks
and then I'm going to go back in with
this warmer shade and I'm just going to
buff that up the cheek again that's nice
so the next thing I'm going to go in
with is the iconic London struggling
stick so it's just like a really nice
highlight and stick but I use it with my
sponge and I'm going to Pat this on and
the reason I like that so much as to it
because it really makes for living
lately your ring Leah ring says we're
going to do so I'm going to Pat that
onto my cheek get that straw bond but
I've got a few traps Elise and I'm going
to be in hot places and I can see me
just using this by itself and I get my
skin that really nice kinda luminous
look healthy healthy ear so I'm just
going to use that on my cheeks you see
that gluey now I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
say my highlight with my back or pearl
quite extreme I know everybody used my
via fan brush so a lot of people say
that the struggle learing highlight is
like a cream highlighter and then a
powder highlighter I honestly don't know
fall is with my skin but my skin just
accepts highlight and whatever form it
wants to come in so it's something that
I definitely try obviously you saw the
exact steps I've used to create this
poor pen highlighter and try if it's not
for you then maybe just stick to the
cream of the poser but when you use it
in little late layers oh my god it's
incredible and we need a little bit as
highlight just and it put my nose little
10-man nose and then I like to just use
a
but in the Senate I'll keep it full of
notes hit Cointreau and I'm going to use
at the turret Park Avenue princess a
matte bronzer in a and the brush I'm
using is mr. right from two feet I love
this brush Supercross is tiered approach
it's the base for contouring which I was
surprised access quick beg but watch
this we do have a product like I will
definitely be doing this can see if ever
I know that my fall is going to be taken
or I just want to look real real nice
I'll be doing this good okay so once
I've drawn to this I suppose it does
gonna set in contour as well and I'm
Google in with my darkest contour and
this is the makeup Schaller version I
love this so much I've been using this
on my eyes so lastly oil as well but
this color here for just right in the
back of my : cleaner is perfect
Leslie blusher for a transition between
the highlight of the clauncher so nice I
am and then that's I use as a powder
just to kind of buff ate my quarter and
thanks I just really like this palette
and I think she should be very proud of
yourself so I'm going to first go in
with this shade here and I'm just going
to start who put that underneath my eyes
a little bit but see a little bit of
that just a diffuse diffused contour and
then I'm actually going to use the shade
here for contouring so I'm gonna go in
with the same brush this is my smith
one-one-two brush and this just gets
that date back Mike was the nicest color
over
and then I'm actually going to use a
little bit we're going to swap a brush
back to my mr. right brush the bigger
one and we need a little touch of this
highlight highlight blush to send my
under eyes properly I'm going to use my
laura mercier secret brightening powder
for under eyes i have mentioned this
once before and i use it every day of my
life I love it it's a really great
powder and I do not crease whatsoever
when I use it so that is the ear more of
the game oh yes perfect so if you wanted
you could Gore you could probably go a
bit later or a little bit deeper but I'm
happy with that now I'm just going to
chuck a little lip on and let's do
something really weird and different
student it I have to tell you that see
this Urban Decay liner I have gone
through about six of them at love them
and it's just one of their I just left
I'm the only crime I have is that it
runs it quit quickly like a school and
clothes are so creamy it just goes blunt
really quickly so I'm just going to line
my lips and I like to go straight across
my Cupid's bow actually a straight line
there
so I'm going to use my iced tea so
Beverly Hills stripped yeah it's so nice
it's one of my favorite liquid lipsticks
so I'm going right over that later and
you'll notice it Tina does it down a
little bit more now is my nude lip of
choice for the day
Jamie's top million new lipsticks so
what we're going to do is we're just
going to use a teeny little bit of that
Make Up For Ever HD powder this is the
Pozzo that everyone is using too much of
like you're using the powder to stay at
their entire face which I I just get a
little bit and just put it right here
and I don't know if that's what you're
gonna do but everyone's going nuts over
hope you use this powder and I was like
using a tiny little bit in the side of
my face
it might oppose me going in a center it
keeps the glue alive to lurk here about
I would say this is such an easy thing
look because if you look I've got tall
glittery eyeballs super sculpted skin
and it's a little bit like this can I
used to do it or myself so lately I've
been a bit more natural so this is kinda
back to heavy makeup it is definitely
heavy makeup before anyone tells me
wearing too much makeup I know and I
love it I hope you guys like this
tutorial as always I will link
everything down below that I have used
and yeah I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
