week we are going to do is super easy
super quick
first of all inspired makeup so
obviously is somewhere and it's festival
season there's lots of festivals going
on in Scotland UK and probably all over
the world which is great so we're going
to do a festival inspired makeup but
also I'm going to be using L'Oreal so
that's obviously a drugstore brand you
get it everywhere in the world and and
when I asked you guys on Twitter and
things like that pork anybody what you'd
like to see and quite a lot of you say
it's drugstore brands which is great so
me and Molly all teamed up and I'm going
to do this makeup for you so it's super
quick it's not that many products as
well which is obviously good if you are
going to a festival you'd want to be
taking a full makeup bag and then show
me oh yeah let's get started so the
first product we're going to use is the
brow artist maker which is a pencil type
product so it's got I cannot chunkier
pencil at the end I'm just going to use
that through my eyes right so I'm going
to start at the tail of the blue because
it's a chunkier pencil what I like to do
this is just paint it on top of the
hairs leaving the front for your product
at the moment it's quite good if you go
over your brow line at all you can just
use your fingers and it blends to be
quite easy and then I'm going to swap
over and it's got like a little tiny
brush another side you can pick it I
mean what I'm gonna do is I'm we're just
brush that through my blue which makes
it rebus officer very nice is Sarah and
then what you can do is you can just go
through the brows with a spoolie if you
have one don't worry if you don't but I
just like to use that just to comb the
products through a little bit more and
make my brows nice and bushy different
fishing is that the right word yes so
it's up to you you could leave your
braids like this if you like what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the
nude magic oh yeah
Savage I can't sleep friend nude magic
cushion Jude Law Foundation which suited
me before the town so it's a wee bit
later for me I'm going to talk more
about the foundation when I actually go
to use it but for the moment I'm just
going to use the sponge that's here west
of my little brush get some product on
my angle brush and I'm going to carve
out my eyebrows and this is really nice
because of the foundation it's obviously
not as heavy as some concealers so when
you use foundation in your braids it
Cady's them up it makes them stand out a
little bit more but it's not as harsh so
it's quite nice and soft so all out
those is it Newton's up diapers and then
it makes it so we're going with
foundation later we do need to go to a
coastal I bruise survivors are pretty
much done next we're going to do is were
going to move on to eyes I've quickly
pop V Kraemer out and and we're going to
be using their L'Oreal palette knit and
this is what it looks like super nice
neutral colors and the colors are there
as well which means easily stick one
palette and I'm going to go n where the
later shade here which is a matte canna
cream and I'm going to use my brush just
a fluffy brush and I'm going to put up
all over just to save my eye and I'm
going to go in with the super fluffy
brush and this shade here which is I
really like matte taupe color and we're
going to use that in the crease we'll
keep in my eye or pen I'm just going to
place this color and the crease working
it rien with side to side movements and
the crease and then when we get the
torso go I'm going to turn my brush up
on its side and use the edge of the
brush just to help blend out so what
phase one's but I would you can call
rate your cards and things like that
if you're like me and we were black
every day of your life and you're
probably gonna want to rock a smoky eye
that first of all I think first of all
you can be great grungy perfect so once
you've got that color build up I'm gonna
swell for remove a brush we're going to
take a slightly smaller slightly more
dense brush and I'm going to pack on
this color
which is a darker Brown it's a wee bit
warm as well which is good for blending
those helps and we're going to apply
that just increase as well but just a
bit more concentrated
I'm going to go back and slice left the
brush with the transition color the
first color and just blend that out a
little bit more and I'm going to going
with a pencil brush and that same dark
color here and wiggle under my eye I'm
taking a slightly more dense brush again
and I'm going to go with a second darker
shade here which is a really really dark
chocolate Lee Brown I'm going to pack
that on to the outer corner using that
v-shape that our IQ is so go ahead onto
the large and then back up and then onto
the crease I'm going to go under my eye
again but with the transition shades and
just cannot smoke that underneath and
then I'm going to use the second color
end which is a really nice light
shimmery shade and I'm going to pack
that onto the lid
we can do as well as they shoot it
really nice for an eyebrow hi ladies I'm
going to use a fluffier brush and I'm
just going to pop that on top of where
we use the foundation to cover the brows
now I'm going to use a really tiny tiny
little angle brush and I'm going to go
in with it's a black shade in the
palette and I'm just going to stamp this
across my lash line just to make my
lashes look a little bit thicker because
let's be real here who can use gel liner
and attaint now what we're going to do
is I'm going to use the mega volume mess
hippie lash which is a really nice
mascara that gives you tons of volume
I've been ridden s the last week or so
and I love it it's always good to get a
good drugstore mascara I feel I feel
like we did the best ones and we're just
going to make these lashes make some
chunky because we're not going to use
false lashes today so right in at the
root
mm-hmm so I'm going to do skin there and
we'll go back to ice with another
product so the foundation I'm going to
use is the nude cushion but as their new
super to equal foundation which
obviously I'm a huge fan of and if
you've been following me for a while
you'll know that I've been working on my
skincare so this is my skin with
absolutely nothing on it um and I have
been dabbling in lighter coverage
foundation so this is perfect what I'm
going to do in it comes where quite as a
compact you open it up it's got a nice
mirror on the top and it comes with a
sponge as well so the idea is that you
use your fingers you open this up and
use a little care sponge that's filled
with your foundation and you Pat it on
and then you pat it on to your face so
I've tried that and I do like it but as
a makeup artist I am going to be using a
brush today so I have two colors here I
have a lighter color which I'm sure it
is the color seven which I'm going to
use on the high points of my face and
I'm going to slightly darker color to
warm my skin up because it's super
gluing Joey M it was beautiful when you
do it like that so let's get started
just pushing that into the skin the we
sponge is amazing so see when your towel
and that's fine but if you at home try
it with a brush and I feel like you can
get a little bit more coverage if you do
it like this there's going to be the
circular movements just a blender and
good thing about this foundation as well
is it's got SPF so it's SPF 29 which is
going to obviously for festival goers so
this is me using the darker color and
I'm just kind of doing a slight contour
with it is closer to my shade I would
say
those 20 times really lovely just makes
your skin like the healthiest see ya
Jerry ah the dream so once your
foundation is on it gives you more
tonight do it late night late we jump
coverage we're going to go end with the
glamour orange litera so you've got your
ticket out here bronzing tone you've got
your peachy
I've got your gonna blush orangie tone
so I use these colors separately so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to get the slightly peachy color I'm not
just going to do a little late just to
that just under my eyes and you think it
would go play orange but it doesn't it
just lifts it gives a really nice lift
to the eye and then I'm going to go end
up with the C kind of mid-tones here I'm
going to quieter
and we want my brush to a slightly
bigger brush so I can start using that
as a bronzer now and then at the end
towards the end I'm going to mix these
colors all together to get a nice came
out to Lutter type nice
so what using a smaller brush for the
college student is whopping into a
bigger brush for the bronzing part and
then I'm going to slightly bronze ruin
my chain my forehead as well only like
the way that Pedro's gone top of this
window then I'm going to grab a slightly
smaller eyeshadow brush where these two
colors here and I'm going to contour the
sides Mentors it's the perfect color for
this it's not too dark and it's not too
warm so it genuinely just looks like a
really nice light shower door and then
these clothes are actually really
beautiful on the eyes as well so I'm
going to grab my fluffy brush and with
one with the orange shades just to help
blend go in with a slightly more dense
brush and a darker Brown and I'm just
going to apply that in the crease
last but not least we are going to do
lips so I'm going to rub off any excess
foundation and then always see a fit of
first of all thank you don't hand your
lips are going to be dry also a
nightmare if you're applying like a
really matte lipstick and you're in it
throughout the day
obviously festivals have limited
amenities so I personally prefer a later
lipstick so I'm going to use the sexy
BAM and as f I'll show you what that
looks like just now I gotta Finley not
to mention that these smell incredible
so obviously these aren't like a really
payment a lip balm so yeah that is my
festival inspired makeup using L'Oreal I
feel like you could just peer that with
I've also got like a bit chickened out
here because I had a curl J sturdy and a
little top knot and I know what pleats
which look really nice and obviously a
lot like kind of floral headbands and
things like that but this is a makeup
that looks beautiful it's super light
and it's fresh on the skin which is
great for when your face to bling and
also we usually nice like something out
of it different for you guys
I hope you liked this video hope you
learned something cool obviously I use a
couple of products in a couple different
ways which is great but something else
you can do which I like to do is if you
have any free curls like me that you
want to paint in you can use a little
brush and your bro marker just to turn
em on so you can get some fake freckles
for your festival and so these products
are really good I think I usually what
waiting to see 4 5 6 i7 I use 7 products
which is amazing to create a fill fees
and you can imagine how much space that
will take up in your makeup bag so I
hope you guys like this tutorial and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
