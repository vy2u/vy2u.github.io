week and we are gonna do pretty much
your face toriel so I'm gonna show you
exactly how I create this eye look and
that's skin I'm gonna show you how to
clear this lip as well so me and
interpretate which is massive shopping
center and guys wall where I am from
hometown whole time but we have teamed
up together and I basically have chosen
I basically hand-picked cherry picked my
favorite bet it's from Renee that you
can get in for junior makeup so I've
actually learned loads there's a lot of
brands that you can get really hate that
I had no idea you'll see me like good
mail about them Israel and I am just
absolutely loving this look I've had
this all myself so if you'd like to see
how I created that slick stay tuned okay
let's do this i so i have done my blows
obviously and i have concealer
underneath the arch and either planed it
might led with an eyeshadow primer so
when you was treating it with my shadow
so i'm gonna go in with a warm light
brown as a transition shade and i'm just
going to use that and the crease just
here and using quite a fluffy brush for
those nice and blended and then i'm
gonna drag that product underneath as
well for this color you want to make
sure that you're using a nice matte but
I owe nothing shimmery because all the
shimmer is going to be on the lid making
sure you're getting lots of pigment
there and I'm claiming that I've already
done my base foundation so I'm not done
anything on top of it yeah just a
concealer and foundation so I'm blending
into that and smoking that right up to
quite a high up from the brow cool I'm
going in with a slightly more tapered
brush and a dark ash brown shadow and
I'm just going to dark out the crease
and under the eye as well making sure
you're getting the product on there and
make sure you're good underneath as well
I'm not bringing the dart right into the
senator that I'm just kind of focusing
on the oak or coroner just now and then
I'm gonna go back and with my fluffier
brush and I'm just gonna buff that out
I'm gonna leave that shadow there I'm
just gonna mattify the lid ever so
slightly with a late cream shades and
then the exciting parts
this is Steeler magnificent makes little
eyes so that shadow is absolutely but
when you know how to work with it it's
absolutely incredible so it I put the
color in titanium which is obviously
silver but what I'm gonna do as you get
the cutest you get the little cutest
little tree so what you do is you put a
little bit of the mixing medium that
they give you really small things you
put a little bit of the mixing medium
that they give you and with the little
say it just one drop you don't need much
at all that's why you only gave me like
a teeny little water and then once
you've got that on so I'll show you this
is my little drop here
I'm gonna take my synthetic brush this
is just a synthetic paddle brush it's
quite a firm one and I'm going to tap
some of the shards also is a weird
consistency it's like I cannot clean but
knock cream that makes no sense but yeah
I'm gonna get back up some lunch door
and I'm gonna put it in with this liquid
I'm just gonna mix that up so it looks
like it's looking a bit mason to be
honest but trust put your faith and me
whenever I really you're doing before so
once I've mixed that up and it's almost
like a it still looks quite metallic II
but it's like a jail you just start
packing that on nights or
and create the bowl I just love that the
texture is so different to anything else
I've used we've got plenty of colors and
these um I picked us up from at Marks
and Spencers and then typically hate who
knew Marks and Spencers that amazing
makeup not me I tell you that and I'm
just bringing it left right up to the
crease because it's all Metallica I do
not mind if it creases because it's just
it'll be almost beautiful creasing eye
shadow you remember had nearly insane
and I'm going to get whatever his
lifetime a little poor you don't need
much I like that I think that's all ashy
so long and I'm just gonna place that in
the inner corner
if you know me I'm not back on like
shower but my goodness me I love this
and it's really easy to use it looks
quite scary in the port but the easiest
things to use and then I'm going to go
back and with my little crease brush and
the dark brown eyeshadow and I'm just
going to buff that and
oh I mean that is just often I am
obsessed I love it now we're going to
add a little bit Elena - let's look to
make it a bit more dramatic that says
the gosh eyeliner pin so easy to use see
if you struggle with your lane no get
this pain it is cheap it's really cheap
and cheerful it's just wrong the super
drunk and into being head when it comes
just like guys and see if we're just
getting a nice Fleck like I didn't use
keypad anything for this or super easy
let's do this
get in that Lane nice and close to the
lash line and now we're going to just
win there so so always making sure you
look into their side okay
no it definitely absolutely Zee we could
have nor mascara or and I'm going to use
the Hypnose mascara from Lancome
Malayali on my body I need to work my
fringe
there's so much nice French make up the
I don't know head planes and I got those
from boots and in Tiffany head I am
gonna just put these lashes to work just
gonna make them nice and dark nice and
thick I love it this little brush that
comes with it
it's plastic which I prefer to really
fluffy fluffy ones in which the same
plate is the lash beautifully and it
doesn't go all Kiki by theme you're
finishing your mascara I've used this
quite a lot of times already and it's
just like it was brand new
okay and making sure getting involved in
lashes well I'm leaving the waterline
blank for this looks all you need to
that clash is to gonna make a difference
I'm just gonna go in with a little nude
pencil it's hair can I meet this
waterline a lot with great hair
okay now that there I makeup is finished
we're gonna step on a lash so this is
the allure volume number 100
supernatural fluffy but they do add like
a certain song send to the looks or I'm
excited with them and I picked these up
from Marks and Spencers as well Marks
and Spencers what are you doing to me
your wedding so I'm not going to trim
these guys they are quite long but I
quite like it when fluffy lash for it
literally to go from the end of my high
to the inner corner so I'm just gonna
use a little pair of tweezers I'm just
gonna slow this LaShawn
and then I blow a really great type this
lash it's got a really nice thin little
band but I love going over it with the
pen the eyeliner paint just make sure
it's super black
as eyelashes on which just add enough
drama for it to look a little bit cool
but we're never going to want to scan
and I've already learned that my
foundation and concealer under my eyes
the best pasted little guy is not a
disappearance or ignore it ignore it
everybody cool and wear Chanel Universal
bronzer so I picked us up from boots and
interpret heads they've got a Chanel
counter in there and this is like a cult
beauty class I most makeup enthusiasts
know where eyes or they love tried it
before or they will want to try it
because it's nails amazing and it looks
amazing so I'm just going to go ahead
with that and just vinegars Real
Techniques buffing brush so this is
really for foundation but you can get
these from this super dark and I'm just
gonna get some of that frogs eyes so
it's nice and dark and we're going to go
on top of my foundation I have not proud
of my foundation dye own yet because I
knew I was going to use cream products
so don't pay it off reuse this guy and
I'm just gonna warm up because it's
actually like I don't consider it
anything like that but I do warm up the
same media's that I'm gonna be grunted
and I mean so it's going to be like
cheeks around your Chan oh it smells
like summer I'm gonna use it all over my
cheeks just to warm myself up I know
it's technically not someone anymore at
bar I want to love the tan like okay
like this takes two seconds even if you
don't wear makeup
if you don't Griffin nation during the
day see just a little bit of that stuff
to warm skin up and smooth it out you
cannot beat it it gives you such a nice
natural blonde and if you went to Hades
always you can just go back with your
foundation brush which this is just a
buffing brush as well and I'm just going
to kind of bring that back a little
bronzer fad
I've already done my foundation like I
said my favorite thing for underneath my
foundation
a magical Marengo which you can pack up
at lunch which is also put into brie
heads and that stuff is just phenomenal
it's like I'm at moisturizer that's got
it's perfect for like essential oils and
doesn't just beautiful beautiful
ingredients that are good for this game
they're great for can protect in your
skin for each end they're great for
hydrating the skin but the fact that
it's a matte finish so when you put your
foundation on you still get that Google
through from like your inner ghoul
because your skin hydrated but it's not
shiny and your phone is not gonna slack
off because it gives you that perfect
beads so it does actually advertise
itself as a makeup primer I feel as
moisturizer so love that so I popped
that one already I think that's like my
Universal bronzer setting so names today
if I do this all myself and I'm going to
go in at where another at Marks and
Spencers friend Diego de la Palma so
this is the bronzing pilots are
complexion hunts enhancer but I'm gonna
use this guy for contouring so it's a
nice beautiful matte bronzer and I'm
going to go ahead we're just your
average tall contour brush and we're
just gonna mattify the cheekbones not
too much but enough just together add a
definition I'm just gonna put a little
touch very much or not too much and a
little bit more forehead no money when
we're Topshop makeup believe it or not
Topshop highlighter and horizon so it's
just like this but I'm gonna use this as
one of the blinds oh so it's not late
enough to be like I'm a list of your
highlight like I like but seating adds a
glow to the cheek but you do tend to
lose they were going and taking autumn
when so your skin does loo that natural
glow that you get from so not that we
get any healing Scotland but I like
taking I'm Eric that so I'm gonna use
those and I'm just going to
and on top the corner like so just like
above the quarter circular motions and
that's just gonna warm it up would be a
bit more but it's got such a beautiful
finish to it it just reaches can look at
like at school and enter late and it
also helps to modify down there it says
Chanel Universal blowing so for my
highlight I'm gonna do something a
little bit different so this looks
skinny but it's not this is a Topshop
eyeshadow called shuffle the cards as a
highlighting eyeshadow law and as like a
year law with a pink pen relation to it
but all my words is phenomenal
I wore this when I was working in the
South Lawn and where the girls just like
why have you got your face and
something's in so it just gives off such
a beautiful changer that it's good
because you can use it on your nights as
well I'm gonna go in it with theirs and
a little kind of synthetic buffing brush
I love using synthetic brushes for any
kind of shimmer products so let go I've
got my eyes and like bears I like using
synthetic brushes so we're gonna get
quite a lot of that fronds out I'm just
going to start leaving that on I
remember
I like quite a lot of highlights I don't
need to be this much one if you don't
like but if you do like that's good I'm
deleted and it's just about what
different I love it
beautiful day a little bit down the
noise as always and a little button to
keep his ball how exciting is that you
came back tonight when your dad was just
like overly set glass just beautiful
perfect so that is me finished with my
skin last but not least we're going to
Gerry Lucky's so I spoke about this lip
liner before total bargain tip aliens
true boots natural collection and again
until enhanced or guess as well and this
is the amount of collections of like
liner and espresso obviously all the
products I've seen here I will les blank
down below the video I wish to start
with talking keep us cool
now we've done our lip liner I just kind
of like Kamel up so you drop together
just what kind of leans a little bit and
it looks like we're going to do is a
nude lipstick and a covetous note by a
Lord so that's one of their new matte
lipsticks and it's domain I love a
mallet or when they brought these out
was really really chaste and we're just
going to go on top of the liner on one
just so it blends in nicely
we're just gonna fill the whole weapon
what beautiful shade oh and it's one of
those like fixes will that it bought
that is sculpting sore is really good a
cute overdraw your lips a little bit
like me but it goes on that beautiful
satin matte texture and then it
mattifies actually like I take five
minutes or something so I absolutely
love it to bits so guys that is the
finished look I hope you like okay I am
so chuffed with the makeup and managed
to grab preventively hate I can't
believe that I could get all this
amazing stuff in all these products and
I st. area that I all enjoy work done
