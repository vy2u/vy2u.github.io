again this week with my third of three
number three of three videos that me a
nautical experience put together aim to
give you tips and tricks on how to do
your makeup when you do glasses so I'm
when I can I put these all in a little
secret folder sort my glasses video
subscribers can go and have a look so
first week we did quite a natural look
second week we don't quite a dramatic
look for eyes and in this week I'm going
to show you how to do this eye makeup
but I'm also going to show you how we're
doing skin when I'm wearing my glasses
so the main thing is keeping this area
like foundations being on which I think
I've figured out a really good way to do
it so that's what we're going to show
you this time so of the expresar
basically ah yuki glasses company that
do your lenses they do contact and it's
Dooley's and i so today's race or any
yuki their massive thank you guys so
much for all the feedback thus far on
these modules me not collect I suppose
really really thrilled with how it's
going down and I'm just really glad that
you're paying them useful so if you'd
like to see how I created this look stay
tuned okay let's start off with this eye
so I'm going on why soft ochre it by Mac
and as always as long as you've got a
good base I did eyeshadow just so it
doesn't crease and I'm just going to go
all over my lid there's stuff great
poise it covers up any discoloration and
the lid but it also goes quick tacky so
when you're using your shadows on top it
will not move and I'm gonna buff a
little bit of that underneath as well
now I'm going to go in with sweet smell
from the Reebok smoky palette that I've
just broken which basically it's just
like a nice warm blown transition shade
and I'm going to use that all on my eye
or going into the crease first
the brush I'm using as a sugar pedal
tapered blending increase brush that is
synthetic and super fluffy are actually
a little bit so this brush is good now
I'm going to go and wear the color ashes
a week which is just a fairly nice
Ashley dark groan from the smoky palette
still I'm gonna go use my is weave out
luxe crease brush and I'm just going to
darken up the crease of this eye and
underneath as well just like that with a
cool back and with my sugar pill brush
and blend the darker Brown it just a
little bit those tapes like to take
ensue so good then I'm going to go in
with revive the moon no release them in
which is just the lightest shade I'm
just going to go on this bit on the lid
it's good even though we're just keeping
this ledge quite neutral it's always
good to mattify it down just enough
increases now I'm going to use my
favorite magic pencil from nabla just to
just to break it up under here boom
precious is easy and I'm going to go in
with the makeup forever liquid liner
Aquilino which is a waterproof eyeliner
which is imported and actually glasses
like me my eyes tend to be more
sensitive when I've got them on so it's
good to use waterproof for the Rose so
that's why I like nice waterproof liner
and let's get this flick on you'll
notice Israel that this flick is a
little bit smaller than my usual
so it just kind of suits the glasses
more of everything is going to
concentrate it on the eye so let's get
this flick
and now just to dark it all up I'm going
to pop a bit of mascara on this is my
favorite Matic up Road lash which has
got like a teeny tiny little brush which
usually good for belt in the lash up so
for glasses these it's much better than
winning false eyelashes because it's
getting away you should get your bottom
lashes as well perfect
and I said I've done no that's just
kidding
I'm closely moisturized what I use my
favorite blush magical merengue eye
mattifying moisturizer that hydrates
your skin but also kind of prepares it
for makeup now I'm going to go in with
sex class split all of your fees so
flesh now I'm going to go in where this
is a new Italian right but I love it
it's Lamade collage professional so it's
French I will write it there wall so you
can see this feeling and it's a makeup
mixer but like you'll see is really like
liquidy but I love this as a primer I
see specially if you are oily or you
feel like you're to pop that one and you
feel like your makeups like the string
to do this works one Zoe's so what I'm
doing that all over my face I'm going to
focus it here because that is we're
obviously you're taking your glasses on
and off and it's pure nightmare to keep
your makeup and plate so I like I'm not
just talking about seeing glasses a bit
like sunglasses inside as well so it
smells like babies and a nicely perfect
no one forgot that way I can hang up are
we sick just to chill just to say we're
going with my favorite all-time skin
base foundation and eight point five
that is my color so we bit warmer than
me and your life but look at my shoulder
computer methey let me know I'm actually
blown and I'm using my zoeva
silk finish buffing brush
I must could pop that on all over
circular motions dabbing Danish Docs
that is like generally what we're doing
they do I love the finish this condition
gives me so I want a good coverage I'm
working today all video recording I'm
working so I want it to last me all day
and this usually does a pop that on all
over I'm just going to make sure I've
got underneath my chin don't forget that
bass giddy up I'm going to use my wake
me up concealer and IV I think it's
telling it's fine and I'm gonna put that
right there
we're gonna light that up right there
Noah's been the nose as well hey
whiskers and can I put this on my spot -
no it's far too late but it was there in
the home sports could you get my Beauty
Blender and then spray it with my folks
clothes so it's damn and then let's
blend this out so using this state
specifically it rained the nausea that's
pushing the foundation enter this cancel
but Ollie there's less my child of your
friend nation coming off and ruin your
glasses so making sure you're pushing
that and getting rid of all the excess I
kind of like be blamed in just the whole
middle of my face because that's the
area that usually slips around about for
an easy life I love just using these two
to contour and highlight my face and I
wouldn't really use much blowing so this
is kind of like a quick makeup this is a
Mac or one sexy brush exact same eyes as
we've our brush and the view one's much
cheaper so you probably just do that and
I'm going to go in with the Mac dark
time first and we're just going to
contour slightly slightly contour more
bronze the face up so good and really
cheap ones are bringing that up and I
like in this tree it was hoping my
foundation because it screaming it kind
of works into the foundation a bit more
it gives more of a natural glow
it's already forehead cheekbones
I know me better the jawline is will
fresh and groin no I'm going to go in
with my Smashbox fan brush and soft and
gentle by Mac kind of like the cult
highlight isn't it what and I'm just
gonna highlight my cheeks I use a lot of
highlighter I feel free not to use as
much but if you do we can be best
friends I'm just kind of picking up the
product like this so I'm having the fan
brush flat and I'm just kind of doing
this like scrubbing it on and then I'm
using that seem safe to the pause at the
product onto my face that's how you get
it that Shamy
I think the key is not to powder before
you put it on as well
down the nose just to say on earth and I
always bring a little bit just onto my
forehead to give that shiny sweaty look
that's my favorite well this is my
secret to get and its lasts all day
okay so LMS colors pays doe saw
important love it to Burt it's my
favorite one of my favorite products
actually and I'm going to go in with my
Sigma soft blend concealer if 64 brush
this brush is amazing I use it for
patron on my eyes I use it for this
trick so I'm going to go into top the
lids and get quite a bit proto and I'm
going to pack it on there so it looks
right so you may have heard the team Kim
baking before I'm pretty much going to
bake my nose but with like translucent
powder so I'm not doing it with any
color powder you can do if you like I
don't really get to your notes or I'm
just going to go ahead and pose erase my
face normally but I'm using this little
brush for precision sore you can see
definite undermines that's just totally
it smooths everything I am a close
everything down which is the best song
mood to that nother day and we're going
to do Ramon always smell swimming down
my upper lip and we do it a little bit
on my
for heat but forehead okay so see that
pouch out on left on my nose I'm just
going to leave that for the time being
it's professional not good just that
works it's done it's finished that is
like the math test of Matt scan you can
never get and I'm just going to going to
go around the bridge of my nose actually
for real glasses set so the secret is a
good primer and hundreds of odo okay
leave that like that just now I approach
it down a southeast as much as I want to
adult tend to use too much Provo just
because that can end up looking a wee
bit dry a wee bit dry let's get a lip on
this from elapsed I'm just going to use
the jarred cosmetics hydramat what color
and serenity I'm sure this is Manny in
movies color which is pretty cool
because he's creepy funny ugly so what
let's do
that's cute but they're not making them
okay in that is the finished look so
what we've done is are pretty neutral I
am not too dramatic not to be difficult
but you still get that kind of drama and
a please pinklet and what we focus on is
this video here so this is totally dry
to the touch which means when you put
glasses on you look many fun but also
when you get them back off again there
is no residue on your glasses and this
video is completely intact so to be fair
this works to an extent see if you are
outside it's sunny it's difficult it's
really difficult keep your makeup on
especially if your reading glasses or
sunglasses but this check I would say
helps is the only girl good like five
times longer than usual so I love it so
yeah that is the finished look I hope
you guys like to and I will see you next
week with more videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
