we are going to do a really nice smokey
eye and like I have on right now yeah I
just thought this is a really nice soft
look but still traumatic
you still look quick put together and it
doesn't take years to creat I would like
to see how I created this look please
stay tuned
look there's a thingy word I need to be
credited you okay yeah you love you so
much but okay so today I woke up and I
feel a bit sick but I feel bit better
tonight
so I thought I would record a video for
you guys so I decided that I was going
to show you this look here I've not done
I feel smoking every whale and then I've
not used makeup Caniggia so I thought I
would do that so I've already done my
base already and I've done this side of
my face I've highlighted this side and
bronze up as well so I've waited and I'm
going to do that for you guys on camera
so what I've used first and already I've
already done up in this eyes will is
after I use my shape tape concealer from
Tarte I went and with my Laura Mercier
and it's called
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder and i really really like it and
I've been using it underneath my eyes
and over my life is well before I do any
eye shadow and it's been holding
everything in place really well so first
I'm going to do is I'm going to grab my
makeup geek little palette these are
probably all my favorite colors at the
moment and I've been using these two
days I've just got them in a little
nabla Z palette type deal I'm going to
tell you as I go along the colors I'm
using about decided I'm going to put
down below all these colors because I do
use them all the time and I just think
it's a really great palette so first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
in with a bigger brush this is my
semester 2 3 2 and I'm going to go in
with the shade beaches and cream which
is just this one here it's just a really
nice neutral color and we're going to
put that all over the eye I'm going to
go into the shade frappe here which is
just a really nice transition shade it's
probably my go-to your transition
from makeup geek and we're going to pop
that in the crease and I don't know
whether at the Paint Pot I used so
obviously over my I what I used was my
lien little mac paint pot as always I
didn't film that for you guys because
I'm sure you've seen it before and then
I say it with the laura mercier secret
photo m and then i I'm just going to sit
in with us and I don't know whether it's
the powder or not but the pigment of
these eyeshadows is really standing out
on me today and if anyone's wondering
why there's more of a shadow on the save
my face I broke my ring light like
everything else I own a I brought my
ring light and actually to know what it
wasn't me
I was doing a way to make up a while ago
I'm just going to go in with my Mac two
to four brushes to buff that but it was
going to add makeup we will go and the
guy took my ring light and so I could
see what I was doing and the guy helped
me to my car and he said for as you want
I said I'll just put it in the boot
that's the problem and then when I took
it out a bit it was in two pieces so
it's a hunk hanging on my wall with a
few like picture hooks huh and that type
of role in these days no we're going to
go in with the shade kookaburra which is
here I used this new Liberty I love this
brown eyeshadow as my favorite I was
going to whack that on with as leave are
two three four just like the shooter
brush then look light shadow brush
everyone's got and I'm just going to
pack that onto my lids and that's been a
couple ik as I think I feel smokes
always a leave it's clearly just because
it obviously it's dark all over but it's
quite easy to turn to do it's quite
quick as well you don't need to worry
too much about blame then you only
really need to worry about blending the
transition shade because best part is
really easy to pack on the color and
then always going back in with my bigger
brushes to play in the edges oh I got a
new brush from Sigma M this is the
pencil brush the e30 and it's just so
small I really
I'm going to go on with the shades I
made a kernel which is this one up here
and another one of my favorite it's
super dark chocolatey brown we look
properly as well and we're going to buff
that underneath and then I would have
wine with my favorite brush
there's Weaver two to four and I'm going
to use the Kookaburra just to smoke out
and I'm just using the brush kind of
flat on its side to help blend that
downwards as well most of my looks that
I do I always highlight then or coroner
but today I'm not going to do that I
wanted to be smoky and grungy I'm going
to go back in with my little she drew
brush and I'm wig or mythical copier and
I'm actually gonna pack that on right
into my dark corner see that smokiness
I'm going to warm with my little pencil
brush from Sigma again the e30 and I'm
going to just put that made a candle
shade right across my lash line just
together leave it a day to the smoky eye
back in my 34 just to blend that out and
I'm going to going with that first mess
brush and I'm just going to smoke out
underneath again wet the taupe shade
okay I'm going to go in with my Kat Von
D dripper Lena as always as soon as
everyday and we're just going to do a
nice Ben Lane really really thin just
from the inner corner to the outer
corner and that's just this deck oh god
I swear these dog here is mine that's
why I'm going to die
suffocation of dog here I swear a brush
I'm like twice a week more than I should
probably it probably should have more
heroes we bought it and needed does I'm
super lucky I got a package from House
of lashes and I want to try this brand
for ages so these are the Peck c-lux
lashes they're just so nice they're like
full mink almost they're double layered
so these lashes are really nice I'm just
gonna put my usual do glue on the green
one that we can now get in the UK you
guys there I was underneath my last
video everyone was sayin that you can
get
- Fred no sore winner once my glue is
drying I'm just going to use my lights
camera lashes mascara from Tarte and
I've been using this everything recently
I think it's just a perfect mascara it
doesn't crumble
I just really love it okay I feel like I
could get more prone eyeshadow on there
I'm gonna go in with me but more cool
cool clear and just build that up just
here
maybe I don't bring it high enough now
we're talking the slide is so nice let's
do this nice let's move on to skin I
thought I would just leave my skin
frequent Oh on a way I'm - my eyebrow
I'm so crazy to see so in my last video
I asked you guys if you'd like to see
updated editing and then I realized that
it generally takes me two minutes to do
my brows notes so I thought that's why I
thought I would come up with a look and
so what I'm going to do with my brows
I'm going to get my Anastasia number
seven brush and it's just the base
little angle brush I've been using this
non-stop and I've actually got quite a
few I bought a couple of them in case I
lose them I'm chasing a chase so I'm
just going to brush through my eyebrows
first am I just tweeze my eyebrows now
and just clean all that kind of shape I
like in things so yeah I just find that
easier so when it comes to grooming
eyebrows you can either get mark stated
order them yourself then I'm gonna go in
with my depth Road as always it's dark
brown which I'm actually going to go and
get medium brown because I tried that
and I actually suit me lot bay so but
I'm using this in the meantime and yeah
I'm going to my brow so starting off at
the bottom like before and just create
in that Lane underneath my brow and then
I'm going to go on top and do the same
thing and I'm just going to follow the
hair first because I'm going to over
draw the eyebrow once I've cannot
partially filled it in once I've kind of
filled it and where the heat already is
I'm going to
about them and then that's how I can
orbit all them make sure that they're
symmetrical good and then for the front
I'm just going to get a little bit more
product make sure my brush is super
small so you see that angle it's like
wrist wrap and we're going to judge the
sketch and at the front of the brow
so I've just sketched a lane for the
front and I'm going to brush the hair
through so I kind of brushed the line
upwards more towards the center of the
brow and then when we get to the front
I'm leaving the link rate defined and
then remember you can always use the
spoolie another side of the brush to
help you brush through the product now
I'm just going to use a lot more
products and I'm going to push the art
to a little bit more on this side no
other than that I'm going to go in with
my gimme brow from benefit and this is
the all package and you get much cuter
packaging though but I'm still working
my way through this tube and when it
rushed through the tail of my brow first
and then just I brushed the front
straight upwards so I trim my eyebrows
I'll brush all the hairs up like
straight and then I'll turn them so I
can really brush these heroes buck words
so I get it nice and cushy at the front
my brushes always run away from me I
swear a pilot might run loose a visible
number arms toad oh hi boss sucker
okay never would have went with my tart
concealer this is the shape tape this is
what I've been using under my eyes for
the last like two weeks and I love it
it's amazing it's my favorite new
concealer I like it better than not the
color I use is light medium and am I
just going to grab a little bit of this
on the back of my hands just a tiny tiny
little touch from the stick and I'm
going to use my little Smurfs through
your toothbrush I think this looks
really much like a like a little lip
brush almost it's just really really
thin I am and it's got those nice fibers
you can use whatever you want I do
prefer a kind of lip brush idea for this
I'm going to grab that concealer on up
the brush and I'm just going to neaten
up the arch of the brow
and I just needs I'd be set up and then
I'm going to wearing it with my backhoe
or pile that looks really sad and needs
replenished ASAP and I'm just going to
pop that on my browbone lovely
so now we're done with frozen eyes and
we're going to highlight so I'm going to
use my March II hope school spec as
always I want is the soft surface I
can't even tell you I can't even tell
you can't even begin to understand to
explain and my favorite way to use it is
with my tart Beauty Blender and and I'm
just gonna bounce that on my cheek and
just even that by yourself I would
honestly be tempted to leave it because
it looks so beautiful and I just can't
cope with life when I've got it on so
I've already done my little nose I've
already got my ten-man nose so I'm
actually just doing my cheekbone here
and a little bit on the jaw just for
that healthy cool now I'm gonna go in
with my sweep this is the rose gold
looks fun and I'm going to go in with my
Baker pearl again and this faithfully
optional I love doing it because it's
really really cool it's ugly and I'm
just going to pop that straight on top I
bring it quite high up Brenda I just
because I love it pretty much
hey I'm going to use my Mac dark tan
it's just a really nice bronzer if you
return and obviously I've been wearing
tons of time so it just really suits me
just like so now we've got that
highlight and we can't take away hi I'm
going to use my blinds art and then the
highlight it'll slightly mix with the
blinds or just in the middle and it
gives just a really nice blend so
instead of you putting highlight over
see bronzer and it kind of kicks up dust
and then your highlight ends up down
here um it just looks nicer I think so I
always do my highlight frosting and I'm
just using my Smith 1 maneet brush
and I like to go underneath my jaw just
bring that the son died my neck love
that my forehead and then I obviously
use my smith one one five brush to do my
foundation I just use that just to clean
that up and it's nice to do that on your
forehead as well if you've got to be bit
too may know the Brawn that's me now
we're going to use my favorite part
blusher st. sure it's just thirty nice
blush so the blush I've been using no
one else now there's all this life to do
okay slips and I bought a new thing
yesterday I'm not trying to get a man
it's there NYX NYX soft matte lip cream
in London so to my camera obviously
guide and I took my Bablu that's why I
look different so the lip liner which
I'm currently sharping and I'm going to
use is my oven Daqi liar lip liner I I
think I've V bought their sleep five
times though okay which means I like it
so I'm going to use that first
tribe lane my lips and I really try this
my lip cream ah that's so nice it's such
a nice texture for him for blending your
lip liner lovely ah
and so this is the finished look I hope
you guys like it and I just think this
was quite a good tutorial for dinner cat
new guys up on what Miley is kind of
techniques of vince'll I like doing my
bees they're my eyes and in my brows
just because you can get that nice crisp
line on the top we're using your deck
