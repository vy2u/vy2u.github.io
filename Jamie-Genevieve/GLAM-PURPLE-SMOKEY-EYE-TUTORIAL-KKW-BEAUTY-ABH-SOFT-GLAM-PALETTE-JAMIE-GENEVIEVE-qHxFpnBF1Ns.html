I am going to show you how to create
this eye look I use the sinus secret are
they
I haven't using the new kk w ph shadow
sticks in this tutorial along with the
soft palate a new lip color smell so i
just thought i would sit down and do a
fun little idol for you guys if you
would like to see how I created this
look then please stay tuned okay I'm
just gonna get started I have already
done all my base makeup my base makeup
on my brows so I will link everything I
have used down below I just thought you
guys have seen me do my foundation a
million times I've not got any new
techniques or anything so this way we
can focus on the eye makeup so the
problem will you say I have used before
I used that I put up on Instagram I
asked you guys if you would like a
tutorial and y'all said yes the product
is the new k'kaw I've been calling them
the shadow sticks so basically they're
like a stick a shadow and these are in
collaboration with a glam masters when
our Guinness are Janice I'm so smart if
I say that wrong I say things all the
time and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
swatch all five shades for you because
this is what made me super excited to
see them and I'm definitely going to be
tried at the other shades so this is the
first shade Janice the next shade is a
short side which is a really beautiful
obviously this is a nice blue this is a
really beautiful copper next one as
comic King which is a gorgeous gold they
are all really fun today and creamy and
nice first point here is dramatic ko
which is black target is on my white
t-shirt don't be mad and then this is
the shade that I use and I'm going to
use today and it's moyer which is the
most beautiful burgundy purple color
wait for those to dry I'm gonna go in
inside the eye makeup
my shape the shade I'm going to use as
the
moyer shape the lovely pert pump and
resume in a little bit the way that I'm
going to use these as a would interest
draw all over the lids and then we're
going to blend it so you have to work
quite quickly with these to do dry down
I will have anything on my line at all
the first time I use these I feel like I
made a mistake by putting them on top of
a primer that was powdered you don't
need that these are really really strong
I'm just gonna grab a couple of blending
breakfast the brush I'm gonna actually
use is the blank canvas
a 22 brushes just a little bit more
dense and then I'm just gonna start
drawing on my eyeball and our really
pigmented I go right up here all over
right up over the crease I click on
create a loop and I take her time and if
you need this airbrush just swap over
and I like to just really buff pages out
with the fluffy brush okay so that's our
first base down and then what I like to
do it is just go on top again and I'm
gonna keep my blade a little bit smaller
so I'm just applying a little bit less I
don't we bit more just onto the legs
today I'm just gonna blend that with a
fluffy brush again and I'm going to go
end up with same product under my eye
and then I'm gonna just blend that out
with a slightly smaller eyeshadow brush
doing one eye at a time just the cause I
want to make sure that the blend is nice
and I'm working between both eyes I'm
worried in case it would dry before I'm
finished laying then okay we're going to
work with eyeshadow and taupe so this is
going to do the same right now let's do
the other eye I hope I - to do the same
thing and I'm just using small brush to
play with the product and we're going to
do another layer we're going C to the
base products all 15 assists and we're
going to start really blame tonight so
the first shade I'm going to use first
of all I'm using the soft long pilot
from honest
see oh this guy right here well loved by
me ouch they really really do like this
palette ribbon about empathy shade and
dusty rose we're going to take our brush
that we just used to blend out the
product everybody's gonna start helping
this say it's gonna go around the edges
of the product and we're just gonna
soften out the blend and that's just
mattifies the jail shadow pencil and
makes it super long-lasting now we're
gonna add in a little bit of drama to
say so I'm gonna go in with this shade
mulberry just here and we're gonna
darken up the outsides and I'm just
using my little small smooth brush the
two four seven through the shadow and it
also just might size it down a little
bit more as well when I don't this eye
makeup it was a lot more rounded but it
was exact same steps and it lasted all
the other my makeup at 7 in the morning
and I took up all of that May at about
11 p.m. and it lasted all day no
creasing no transfer dang it was the
best now to add a little bit of
something son fill it we're going to use
the shade sultry from the software
palette and I'm just gonna put that on
top of the center of my lid it doesn't
cannot meet the look to break or
anything just adds a little bit of
shimmer in the sand oh this is the
champagne pop by Becca highlighter I'm
just gonna pop that on my inner corner
oh I just add a little bit of brightness
to the look and I actually think I'm
gonna go in with the shadow pencil and
would wear my waterline yeah let's make
sure the blending stain and I'm just
going back in with the deeper mulberry
shades and a bigger brush just hit it up
a little bit more smooth I really like
this oh let's add some mascara and I'm
not
and what a delicious today I might just
leave it so I'm just going to use the
Maybelline lash sensational lash
multiplying mascara and black might
serve like bottom lashes now we're going
to do our lips and I'm going to use my
favorite liar lip liner by urban decay
and I got this through the post this
morning this is the pom-pom not as
disappointed either it's definitely not
pomegranate it says Parramatta this is
by NARS as you get on paramount like
pigment and I'm just gonna fire this on
I should make a really nice darker and
mood so you guys that is the finished
look I hope you didn't like that you
know that ice washed all of these
shadows text before we did the makeup I
just want to show you that I hope it
works the same as the first time I did
it but there is the shadow sticks there
right watch this like I really rub in
and they're impenetrable the only thing
that happens when I do that is the
shimmer to stay pretty tightly but
honestly the pretty damn good so I hope
you like this that well I makeup
