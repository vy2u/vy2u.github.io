we're gonna do something a little bit
different so I have teamed up with Co
Beauty again I am so excited for this
collaboration basically this campaign is
all about experimenting with makeup and
doing something you usually wouldn't do
so the campaign is called hashtag make
me so for example this look right here
is make me instaglam and if you're
looking for a tutorial on this look it
is the last video that I forgot this
campaign is all about trying out
different techniques and playing with
makeup from the 26th of March - the
names of April Kobe they have free
shipping and I actually have a desk a
coat for you guys which is CB make me
Jamie and that gives you 15% of all
orders over 25 pounds there are some
brand exclusions that will pop and the
dome bar just so you guys know when I
read this brief I was really excited
because basically the first part was me
starting my makeup like this so you guys
know that I love silkworm I love
Instagram glam this is a cup key so
obviously it's super glam makeup and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
remove all this makeup and then I'm
going to try something a little bit
different so the look that I'm gonna go
for it next what you're gonna see me do
right now as the essentialist which
basically means it's like the essentials
for example I'm used to super full
coverage foundation I am NOT gonna do a
full coverage foundation today I am used
to running lashes I'm not gonna wear
lashes it's gonna be a really fun makeup
I've got some new products here to try
that I have been testing over the last
few days and I'm really excited about
how this makeup is gonna look first
thing I'm gonna do is get my hair at my
face and then we're gonna take this
makeup off let's take this face off
first thing we do is take my lashes off
and the product I'm gonna used to remove
my makeup is well loved by me I'm almost
running out and this is the pharmacy
green clean makeup melt away cleansing
balm with echinacea green envy and I
like to been using this for a long time
the reason that I love it so much is
because when I got it I was told that
you don't actually have to double clean
so what you do is you get your mate I
took it
so much and wait till you see it Mel I'm
quite exactly it was me Oh and once it's
on it's really cooling it's really
really gentle as well you just melt away
your makeup obviously try not get it in
your eyes but if you do which I have
done before it doesn't sting your eyes
make sure you get right in a bit of
mascara right in the braise and you can
see it just starts left and all the
makeup off your face
don't be scared to use a cleanser like
this if you have oily skin my skin is
kind of like company how I look my skin
is kind of like combination oily and a
lot of people with oily skin are scared
to use oil cleansers and stuff like that
but actually it's totally fine for your
skin and it's actually quite good to use
oil if you've got oily skin because oil
is like blue tack it will stick and it
will just pull any excess oil off
without stripping your skin once you cut
to this stage I'm going to go and put
some water on my feet mix it together
with water and then I'm going to use a
physical to take this off so I'm on the
back in two minutes looking less crazy
hopefully haha and the air you have it
so that was just one cleanse of this
stuff and I used a bit of warm water at
taking out emulsify in the oil which
helps pull more makeup up and off your
skin and then I use a warm face cloth
just take it all off
honestly it leaves your skin feeling
sore days and so clean if you want you
can like take a cotton pad and you can
see that there's absolutely no makeup
left on your face it's so good I
absolutely love it and it's also really
really natural so I've been using this
for a long time and I have never broken
out because of it this is my own doing
so just ignore that after that I'm gonna
use my I can't see this brands name I'm
really sorry copy or model V yes a model
this brand here right and this is the
queen of Hungary mess like it's like the
most fine decadent mist
I've ever seen in my life so I'm gonna
use this to tone and shut my pores oh my
god it's such a cheat it just makes your
skin feel amazing and it smells like a
spa next thing I'm going to use is my
chi press antioxidant do i've used this
for a long time this is actually a
replenishment I ran out of it and
I use this just like a serum so I take
about this much on my hands rub them
together but don't just push that into
most good it feels great and on the
bottle they call this use as a hydration
layering piece in your skincare wardrobe
so special my skin is feeling it's super
fresh and hydrated now I'm gonna go in
with my Chi tres Helio tropic SPF this
is also a trainwreck all over my face it
works really nicely as an SPF it's a
natural SPF as well so it's good for
your skin you don't need to whatever
putting any nasty chemicals on your face
it feels great the only thing is it
doesn't smell amazing but because it's a
function and skanky area doesn't bother
me at all now once that's on our skin is
hydrated and clean and protected so
we're gonna go on to the makeup first
product I'm going to use I'm really
excited about this as the charlotte
tilbury flawless filter Hollywood
flawless filter for a superstar at youth
glue and people who thought it was a
very new shade it's not of their
foundation it's almost like it kind of
tented moisturizer or something that you
use with your foundation to get really
nice glow it does give a little bit of
coverage but nowhere near like a
foundation so what we're going to do is
really drop this this is a little bit
tanned
too can I bring my skin color back up to
March and I'm just gonna put this all
over we're gonna use it all over their
face right we do see the finish it's
just really stunning
it's very Charlotte Tilbury right let's
just say that admit your skin look super
Hollywood's
red carpet expensive all that good stuff
right let's start without much and see
how we get on
I had to just use my fingers last day
but it worked really will oh my god I
love it I'm actually and really excited
to use this when I'm on holiday and
stuff I just think that gives your skin
the most beautiful finish and it's crazy
because I'm obviously you saw me put it
on it looked really turned but once it's
blended in it's like same it's just like
I really
luminous like BB cream or something
that's how I explain it and I've just
my fingers and you can't see it that you
can't see any lanes or anything everyone
use this a couple of times but I like it
to add a little bit of coverage just on
my kind of blemish a videos and then the
very center of my face I'm going to use
my camera cornet skin enhancer this is
the shade s x11 I'll show you it it's
pretty tan I'm going to use an eyeshadow
brush I really fluffy synthetic
eyeshadow brush I'm just gonna place the
concealer over every blemish say to my
doors
I just want my skin to look really
expensive and super mortally there's
another youtuber that I really like
she's called Gina Gina shake it I'm sure
her name is sorry if I pronounced that
wrong and she recently did a video which
I'm absolutely obsessed with and it's
called boy be my favorite part of the
whole thing was her video on Instagram
it was beautiful I saw her spot conceal
do a little better brows mascara and a
cream corn her and she looked insane she
looked so good and it was like the
perfect natural makeup so that's what
I'm kind of going for today so I'm just
using this concealer to kind of even ate
my skin tone a little bit more that
Charlotte Tilbury stuff really did work
though I'll show you my skin close-up
when it's done and I'm gonna take a
little bit concealer over my lips cuz
that's just putting me off and see
because it's on top of like a luminous
base you can't really see when I've used
that uncle who read my nose as well
oh my little broken capillaries
underneath my eyes with the excess on
the brush next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna go in with the nerd stick
knitties in the shade board IB which as
the contour stick that I used in the
last tutorial and oh my goodness I just
love it so I'm gonna go on my cheeks
we're just gonna get some shapes her
face I might actually just go down say
to my nose underneath and I'm just
blending that and with a foundation
brush making sure it's all blended then
it's blending really nicely into that
Charlotte Tilbury skin product this is
so stranger that bronzer like night it's
just so strange
Putin bronzer on skin it's not feel
for me but I do like it let's do it Bros
so I'm going to use my usual product
which is the benefit precisely my pencil
but I've gone for the shade number two
which is later than my usual and when i
zoom you and it will do our brows
together though let's just brush our
brows and then I'm just going to get
them a really light fell in at the front
oh this is good actually because this
color is so late I can go quite hey
behind dead and it still looks super
natural and then I'm gonna just be so
that's arch a little bit you can see
that their friends is so straightened
using a brow product that's this late
but has given me exactly the look that I
want I'm just in the same thing to this
play fill in the front down and then
beefing out the arch again I don't have
seen be for now that's not very
appealing is it okay and then the next
product I'm going to use I flip in love
this is the benefit 24-hour brow center
gel and weighty see how it makes your
natural brow hairs look I'm just gonna
go ahead it's got like a little spooley
side and then a big spill aside I'm
gonna go I'm if the bags Billy say first
and really caught these hairs and it
gets to here right from the root courts
it with this gel so you can get that
really beautiful feathered effect to
your natural brow hairs it makes them
look slightly darker because it makes
them wet and then when it says it's say
like it won't move for the rest of the
day they go almost like hard they bright
hairs and then I'm actually gonna make
the front hairs stand up a little bit
more it's time for our trim for my
little bright here so I'm just gonna
take these are these scissors are the
base by the way these are the Anastacio
Beverly Hills
scissors I'm just gonna go along the top
and give these hairs a trim use your
visa Billy to pick up any of the hairs
that fell then I'm gonna go back in and
really just get these hairs done enough
pile of got you zoomed in we're gonna
cuddle our eyelashes this is the Haven
accord
eyelash curler I have been trying I
quite a lot of eyelash curlers recently
and this
is my favorite one then for mascara I'm
going to use my iconic London mascara
the new one I've been using this a lot
lately and it works so well it's really
really good so let's use this and then
I'm gonna add a little bit of mascara to
my bottom lashes as well Minister Mew
then we've got a lot that mascara on I'm
gonna do my lips this is the Charlotte
Tilbury lip cheat and the color iconic
nude I'm just gonna sharpen this pencil
up so it's nice and pointed of course
that's look as supernatural I'm just
gonna fill in my lips naturally first
and I'm gonna bring a little bit the
pencil on to lip and just dab our way
and that's gonna be our lip corner I'm
gonna bring that color onto the lip I'm
gonna over draw slightly on the top
don't like a kind of navies left like a
nice creamy nude but because it's just
let leaner and nothing in the middle it
will wear so nicely all day and it was
still lasts long and it's aged so it's
kind of like perfect for highlight I'm
going to use the rmx living Luminizer
it's like a bomb almost and the first
time I ever saw there's something
someone I was out for dinner and a
friend had it on and she turned her face
and I was like what is on your skin it
looked like health glue from within Lake
she's a good person and it's coming out
of her face it was perfect so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to tape my
fingertips just my index finger my
pointer grab that Pat that into the skin
they'll do the 10-man doors and then
what you can actually do is get a little
bit of X and just Pat it on your eyelid
and it gives a really glossy
almost like a kind of oily led it's so
pretty
and then last but not least I have my
new freckle pin so this is actually a
tattoo I brew marker and it's by the
brand stale Nanda oh it's Korea
this is the color ash brown and I'm just
going to use this to enhance all of my
freckles so I'm just gonna go over like
even the ones in my cheek a little jar
one my huge I've got one right in the
middle of my chin and this is really
easy because it's got a point to it and
you can actually get a color later the
next I may actually get it and try it
doing vehicles in general in real life
that just looks like my real freckles so
let's look about nothing on my skin at
all like I was just born this way I'm
gonna get my skin one last queen of
Hungary nesting oh no it's done you can
ice like my bag head helps doesn't that
fresh outta bed
so this is this can close up you can see
it's just really fresh that glow and my
cheeks is like morning June the flawless
felt earth from deshaney primer thing is
really nice really really fresh it just
kind of brings up my tan in my face a
little bit as well did I do good for my
