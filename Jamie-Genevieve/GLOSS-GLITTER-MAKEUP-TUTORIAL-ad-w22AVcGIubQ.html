I have teamed up with Beauty B and I am
going to show you how to create their
super easy it faces look if you go on to
edited by the ECB it's their blog they
actually have their own version of this
video as well so this is called the
gloss and glitter eye tutorial so really
I'm going to show you how I do my whole
face but and oil at the eye you'll see
that there's kind of like I think I
gloves on the top but then underneath
we've got the glitter is right up my
street so thank you whoever as saying
that that's look to me you obviously
have watched my videos so if you would
like to see how I created this like
stitch and we're going with my stellar
occultation and the next foundation I
have actually used a few things before
it comes and I cannot drop her bottle
see just go and drop that into the back
your hand I've got like maybe like a
pump and a half and then just apply it
with a Beauty Blender that stuff is a
beautiful I have used it I had a whole
tub over a whole bottle and I actually
went right through it this renovation is
just really really really pretty it's
really gluey as well nice for a winter
especially just because it does give
your skin that hydration so this is just
gonna be a really beautiful French
makeup really easy one of the easiest
tutorials I think I've ever done but
still really beautiful for Christmas
time so if you guys are doing your own
Christmas makeup if you're going to it
for a party or if you're meeting with
friends this is ideal and I'm just going
to conceal my eyes like normal
I'm just going to slightly warm up my
face before we get into the eyes keep it
soft today I'm going to jump in it just
now and do it my brows I'm going to use
the Anastasi our roadways in this shade
medium brown I'm just gonna brush room
first
and that does me except grace like I
love that still there a little bit can I
darker as well super easy to get nice
fluffy fresh blows now I'm going to go
into eyes I'm going to use my art deco
or high-performance eyeshadow steel
which is French Champagne and achieved
at number 16 and we're just going to use
this all across the lid
and I'm using that right up to the
crease so when I go in with my shadow
brush like this one here I can just buff
that out like a kind of smokey eye these
pencils are really really good because
they are creamy enough to blend out but
once they say it do you really say wow
I'm gonna do the same thing underneath
my eye
on the top of the eye I'm going to use
the fall and jaw locks
this is really beautiful so it just
comes like a kind of lip gloss and once
you pop that on I'm just gonna pass on
all over my lids it just makes the eye
look like there is a gloss on but
because it's major I actually last a lot
longer than my real blows with
oh that beautiful is that I'm upstairs
never would I have thought to pick this
up honestly you just put that all over
the eye shadow we've already put on
underneath the eye I'm gonna use a mix
of two different glucose I am going to
use one from la splash I've used this
before and a module this is the shade my
tie and is the most gorgeous gold and
then I'm also going to use the let
glitters which are amazing these are
stackable so also I've got bright clean
under here but I'm going to use this
over up here and I'm going to mix the
gold nacelle bar up and put it
underneath my eye so let's do the silver
first and then we'll put on the gold for
the club's to have something to Spectre
I'm going to go back in with this pencil
and just Pat that on underneath and then
I'm going to use a can a small firm
brush from zoeva
just to place this on so I'm just going
to the gutter first and then to cook
glutes at all if it get on your face I
just kind of tilt my head forward and
then place the glass at orden like that
once you have most of the silver
glycerol and just Pat that down as much
as you need to you don't need to bring
this all the way down your face
obviously but it's P really neat this
little containers really cool so I'm
just going to tap some glitter onto the
top using the same brush and then we're
just gonna put the gold on top and that
honestly is so beautiful when you mix
the gold in the silver together now all
of that this look is messing is a chunky
lash I am going to use the pure beg look
mascara can you see the Sun that's
coming in my window is a nightmare
and I'm just gonna bail these lines out
to make them as thick as possible
you could difference in these eyes
that's amazing oh my god I think this is
my new favorite mascara can you see the
difference in my eyebrows right and once
that is done all you need as ellipse so
I'm going to use T average Cosmetics
lipstick in nude and I'm not even going
to use a lip liner today
just gonna pop up on by itself and then
use my finger I'm just going to slightly
stick at my place
and then once you've kind of done one
quart of mascara you can always go back
in and do another one once it's dry for
a bit more thickness and then with the
lipstick again just an a skort
you don't always need lip liner it's
quite nice just to use your thing go to
dull it down a little bit and the
Jerrica make its lips it's a really nice
and nice and matte and that's your
Christmas ready and that is the it
finish that cute guys I hope you liked
it this was super different for me it's
like minimal amount of products it took
me the dog about 15 minutes to do this
whole entire look so I thought it was
maybe quite good to do something a
little bit easier on my channel a little
bit quicker and a little bit of a lip
product so it's actually so much to be
for sponsoring this video I have shopped
with you guys for the longest time I
remember my beauty parcels were in my
life when I was a makeup artist and I
was just studying so thank you so much
and I'll see you guys in the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
