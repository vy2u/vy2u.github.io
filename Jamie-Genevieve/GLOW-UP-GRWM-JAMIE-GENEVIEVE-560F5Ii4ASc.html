week I am bringing you a chatty get
ready with me nothing too serious I want
to show you how to get this entire look
using some new products you know just
just a good ol just a good ol makeup
tutorials like the good old days if you
guys would like to see how I created
this look then please stay tuned we're
gonna do our makeup
drop a hot milk early see Thomas fix his
face
so can't do any questions I do have a
onesie on my ice is freezing okay
apparently summer ends on Sunday summer
ended a long time ago for me it's
absolutely freezing here so first thing
we will do is play for a base I'm going
to use my kite press heliotrope ik
sunscreen this is my favorite thing ever
I need another one already is a bit
crazy but I have noticed that my skin is
being really really good when I've been
using this and also it's protected me
from sun exposure which is a bit of a
joke cause I don't have any sun exposure
Oh once it's done that we're gonna win
with my new favourite products of all
time this is the nude photography fluid
or party to a percent this one here it's
20 quid of cold beauty the only thing I
would say is it gets a little bit messy
but that's probably my fault but wait
till you see this
I'm just gonna put five drops on the
back of my hand honestly if you like
your skin to look healthy and beautiful
this is the one I've got all my friends
won in it it keeps it on sale I note
there lacks in my cheek I went on and I
bought two more they had some left but
keep an eye out to address the situation
it was a mix between a wedding accident
and a boating accident okay so this is
getting fixity that is why I'm getting
ready because I am leaving
my house I'm going to get my nails done
enough if you watch the weekly vlogs
you'll know exactly what I'm talking
about
if you don't ski no I'm just gonna pass
my Kiehl's delete reviving concentrate
you guys know that I absolutely love
this stuff I'd run out there for a
little while but I got a new new one
and I was gonna Pat that on and that is
such healthiest again even if I'm not
doing any makeup one day I will always
do the list of these things ok
foundation I'm gonna use the next total
control drops when I was getting on my
makeup is actually I've got it leaned
out in front of me today you know I just
thought it would be a little bit more
prepared so either a word prepared I'm
just gonna drop this on my face just
like this cigarette girls right that's
that's quite a little courage you don't
actually need that much of it we'll see
what this looks like it looks like a
baby a little bit late and what a
beautiful and identity
oh that's thing that's foundation as
14-pound right and it's not that big you
only get 13 mils of it but if something
is so great and you only need like I
don't know how many drops I had there
but that's for still coverage if you
don't use as much coverage as me you
wouldn't use that much all that highly
recommend at least trying to vote oh man
you know it's bad when your arms are
getting tired
oh so if you guys watch the vlogs then
you'll know exactly what I've been up to
but if you dawn and I've been home for a
little while night I've had a lot of M
videos going to that work for work
recently and by that I mean it the
response ID is just to believe that it
can attain and fail and I've been it's
super busy so it's been really difficult
to sit down and fill them up here we are
I'm gonna use my sharp I'm gonna use my
tire shape tape and medium underneath my
eyes
I hate these bags yeah so we're just
gonna start at doing a little
to the house we moved in here and the
end of me I think so it's been it's been
like five months and we're not really
done much yet but we're start and we're
starting to do some stuff to the house
just getting it prepared for our we
every small renovation I don't use as
much tip underneath my eyes these
things are actually okay and one of the
reasons I'm so tired
I was watching Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows Part 1 we all know what
happens at the end of Deathly Hallows
Part 1 honestly even though it's a
filming I know that it was filmed ages
ago and there's nothing's gonna change
every time I watch it I just really hope
that when that idiot throws the maze and
it goes through the porthole I just wish
that it didn't go through and every time
I'm like all of it won't go through this
time it's a film and obviously it's gone
through because it's a film it was Tom d
visible I think that's what you call
hope I feel like I'm gonna work quite a
lot of makeup today I'm not really sure
what I'm gonna do I know what palette
I'm using because I'm quite excited
about it because it's a super affordable
palette and I look quite a lot of makeup
artists watch my videos so I thought it
would be if I was still a makeup artist
this would be going to my cat for sure
because it's really nice
I'm just preparing my eyeballs with
Tarte shape shape as well I've run out a
little more pimple and I really need to
pick up another one but I have not been
shopping in the longest time but
works good see what I mean though I
think that photography starts
photography fluid through the hills it
says it's an advanced colourless
claiming fluid that uses the next
generation at nano prismatic particles
to reflect light and balance undecidable
hues contains technologies can scan a
pure better specifically in photographs
and we were not me Wendy I swear it's
good so I'm gonna powder donut little
Bart's my face with the fakie beauty
Universal predator just that's great
I've got a couple of little blemish
blemishes
my head I'm just gonna put it up under
my eyes and then over my so yeah after a
what is Terry poor and I was a weight
quite well just thinking about how it
could have been you know didn't have to
be like that do you know and did not
have to do that the dhobi it was just
probiotic no I'm gonna broads my face
I'm gonna use my knives at Laguna
bronzer it's been ages and I've just
been going through my makeup recently
trying to tidy up flash like can I get
all the stuff out that have not been
using for a while so what to use my
Laguna bronzer with my Smith one one
eight brush and when I just start
bronzing up my face good already I
really the color of the guna oh my goo I
cannot wait to look normal
I'm going to just use this same but
brush just to get a little bit of
bronzer doing this a to my nose see when
it's one tire I hate using too many
powders on my skin because I just start
lookin like a cakey monster what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna shoot off
camera and do my eyebrows and it when I
get back we will do our peepers brows
I've started in a little bit darker just
because my root is so low note it kind
of matches it looks kind of crazy just
hang about you'll see a little piece
together and the eyeshadow palette I'm
going to use as the we take this off so
you can probably see it but as the
morphe 825 ear palette and I got this
through the post from Beauty be I'm
gonna check the place that said 19
pounds which i think is really really
good for a pilot at their size and it's
called cobblers face which remains mean
of Christmas which means that I'm gonna
probably be using acrylic
a real flat of brushes at the moment
because the olga stolen I'm just gonna
go in with one of my iconic London
brushes and this peachy shade the light
is she in the pilot
we're gonna just buff that all over as a
mutant okay I think that'll be same yeah
I don't scare you so I'm gonna go in
with that peachy shade and I'm just
gonna buff that all over the legs make
sure everything's nice and matte swap my
brush over for one that's a little bit
more tailored to the crease this is my
Smith 2t2 brush and I'm gonna go and
wear that shade so just here I'm just
gonna start building up that crease so
if you don't see the flog basically if
you don't know me and Jack weekly vlog
and which means we sell my week and then
we add up every single Sunday at 4
o'clock early taboos and one week I went
to Marrakesh I went to Morocco with why
I sail it was awesome reason but Gatwick
- to lose my suitcase so for three days
/ two days we were in Morocco my
suitcase was just sitting in Gatwick
Airport they finally found a terrorist
before we came home and they said the
contents of the bag which included my
makeup bags and stuff and then by the
time I got to go at work your poor
someone had taken my makeup and all my
brushes it with my suitcase so someone
stole it and they're kind of waiting on
my makeup which is pÃªche not happy mood
at all so yeah that's what happened I
lost a lot of makeup I have I have had
to write a list of what was lost because
British series I got in touch with him
and he said that look at me 50% of the
value of what was stolen
there is also one of my good seat belts
was stolen as well which really sucks so
yeah that's what happened so I've
actually been piecing together my little
cat again because if he imagined I was
are we on a trip I took all my favorite
stuff so all my favorite stuff got net
so I'm just kind of building it back up
some companies I doesn't tie any
companies will get in touch with anyone
asking for stuff but some of them are
companies that I work with quite a lot
got in touch to it away and were like oh
can we help can we send you
which is really really nice that's just
the one color you can see it's super
pigmented oh boy I can't leave I said
that I'm gonna go and with this ready
shade obviously and then I think I'll
probably go in with this really deep
brown and then obviously we have to use
one of the shimmers when we're doing
this but I'm gonna try and make it super
dramatic so it looks a little bit
different than my usual I bailed it up
Anna Coren are mostly but I always can I
bring it n to my inner corner because
and I've said this before it seems a bit
stupid but that makes I think it makes
me look super midi like it maybe I don't
know what makes my eyes look I got more
intense so I just like it especially
when you use a warm color to do that so
I'm just going over at all with that
ready color its warming it all up very
nicely called prayer space that's such a
good name I think I'm going to start
blending underneath my nose so I'm going
to go and with these smaller smooth
brush which is 2:30 and I'm gonna bust
that same color the Brady color
underneath my eye I just think that
pilots good colors so I'm gonna go in
with this color just here and I'm just
gonna go in the air a corner that's nice
I don't think it's building up as much
as I wanted to so I might just leave
that then I'm going with the black so it
that's like my day-to-day eye shadow
look I know just stick it back lash on
and be done with it but I'm gonna go in
and I'm gonna do some liner yeah I'm
gonna do some liner so this is the alias
splash art can take slim eyeline artwork
cuz I just got a new one of these
through because it exploded on a play
and ages ago but I actually really like
this later and I checked on beautybay
and it's like 11 pounds which is quite
affordable and it comes in a nice
component and stuff it's like a nice
tomato rose gold but actually good it's
got the same brush tip as the Kat Von D
as well so I do actually just really
like it actually I'm gonna go in with
one of the sparkly or shadows first one
and we're going with this proper copper
one right here so I'm gonna get a little
flat brush so come on in your spray
a little flat brush from a vehicle della
Palma Diego de la Palma a lot of product
comes up which is good give it a little
and I'm just gonna apply that okay yeah
that's good
I'm just gonna patent it to blame the
end to the shot a little bit more good
great last hour later and I so what I
think I'm just gonna do my wings and I'm
going to quite high up Oh
okay so the laner is not really going on
to the corpora Cheryl very well sort of
maybe would have actually done that
first but it will be okay cuz I'm Finn
lashes on
now I'm going to take my little Smith
crush again and I'm going to go in mr.
black shadow in the palette there I'll
use the Smith to face city brush in the
black shadow and this is one of my
favorite steps for a smoky eye it just
makes it look much more put together
alright shadows are actually quite good
too the black one and I've applied it
I'm going to go in with the fluffier
brush and blend the end I'm just going
to mr. ready shadow in a fluffier brush
just to move that black around a little
bit when I used to use a tiny bit of
that black under my eye there a corner
would it do my lashes and see you for
Berlin Mike the last I picked up I got
this so sue me
these are the glam lash collection and
she get them for free mark doesn't
premark get in my onesie keep him warm
and they're only a fiver and you look
great so they've got the little saucer
written on it then you've got your
lashes so let's try to use it I think
I'm going to trim from the end face
because we really want to lose too much
of the length of these so I'm gonna glue
them up with my usual glue I do leave
that then strike I'm going to stack one
of my benefit roller lash I've been
using nice old him lately
really
I always feel a bit silly when I've got
a really heavy eye makeup on and then we
scared I always think mascara makes it
look so much better
well I'm waiting for my lashes to dry
I'm gonna go and with that nice ready
color one more time just to try and left
out any a sheep arse
I think that's what's happened when I
use the black over yeah that's better
let's see what these lashes look like
well they were definitely not drying it
the binds a little bit it's tougher than
I thought it would be so and I didn't I
don't have bend it so you need to get
that we've been first before you put on
your eye they are really nice they
definitely look more sympathetic when
they're on the eye but they're nice
trail give this one a bend yeah that one
went on much easier they're amazing for
premark lashes man that's crazy one
thing I will say this one is fake here
than this one obviously because they are
so cheap these kind of things happen but
it's not it's not over it's not that
noticeable okay time for a face we've
done our eyes now I'm going to highlight
my face using the laura geller gelded
honey this is like the gelato gelato
highlighter and I've been really liking
this actually isn't that so nice and I'm
just using this my favorite brush for
highlight and it's the one free for luxe
powder fusion brush from zoeva good
enough and then I'm going to use a
little eye shadow brush just to do my
nose and then I actually need to do my
browbone and once I highlight my present
one I always just give it a little blend
with my fluffy brush to make sure
there's no crazy
harsh lines I'm gonna add a little bit
more bronzer know that the rest of my
face is all done bringing it slightly
onto the cheeks a little bit more again
there all we have to do is no
our lips so I'm winning is where can it
war seal up to me so first of all I'm
going to do a nude lip right let's just
get that out of the way and I'm going to
use my liar lip pencil by Urban Decay my
favorite ended a lip pencil of old wing
girl laid our lips
and then it looks like I'm gonna use as
the be alert and dirty lipstick by
Smashbox in the shade nerves this is a
matte knit nice color right I'm just
gonna pop this on it's super light like
mess that's fine that's crazy late so
what I want to do is I'm gonna really
pass it back don't know about us now
just gonna pack it back a bit like that
like even that looks much better
wait we're gonna use the Charlotte
Tilbury nude to Kate that's much better
that's what stick as crazy it's going in
there give to somebody else pale I
usually like Smashbox lipstick scissor
but that one is just a crazy color okay
and then I'm going to go on top with
dose of colors lip gloss and Andres this
is a really beautiful really like earth
color I'm going to use my little turkey
s Pro blow to go and this shade chisel
here is a really good contour color so
I'm gonna use that just to get a little
corn turn on okay I'm gonna go and fix
my hair and get changed into real
grown-up clothes and I will be back to
