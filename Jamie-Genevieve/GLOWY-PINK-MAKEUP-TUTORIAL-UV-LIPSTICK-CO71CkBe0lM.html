I am doing this makeup so you see me
create this look I'm using all Kiko
products people got in touch with me and
asked if I would like to create a video
for them for this I said yeah because
I've seen it tons of you guys asked me
to do a review of people makeup to
celebrate 20 years in the industry Kiko
I really think capsule collections every
single ones from March that is nice
capsule and the products are called
active flu but they are these amazing
neon and pencils and these gorgeous love
sex
so it's all about kind of being creative
a dimension with your makeup again which
suits me because I was kind of stuck in
our neutral right
I suppose the nude lip rut I'm sure most
of us could call it started really
really excited it's a little bit over my
comfort zone isn't it these products
have a special neon quality to learn
which I will show you guys close to the
end of the video what happened is
basically the look itself is completely
wearable and then underneath a black
light or UV light these products totally
shine me on like a crazy it's so cool
if you like to see her actually it's
absolutely stitching so the first thing
I want to do is maybe I have here the
Kiko Milano active blue primer and this
is a matte fine beef beef at a colorful
to look like great orange so we're
really intrigued by this in a red on the
box that acidity started on like it's
like paint so you start ribbon to end
the color all the way and I'm just using
that and your center of my face just to
mattify everything don't know my
forehead as well so I can arrest so my
face free product because I quit like
being do if a your differentiation I'm
going to use as the Kiko skin tone
foundation that has an SPF of
steam and there's highlighting the
liquid radiation CS in two shakes folks
and then I'm just going to pump it on my
hand just to hear that one and then I'm
just going to apply this with a Beauty
Blender all over mm-hmm
and I'm gonna go all up they always do
color that to create the sheen I'm using
as neutral or tea and actually as much
internet previously obviously I've just
been a waste or a wee bit kind of a lot
about three times the lift on coverage
and probably medium I'm building it up a
little bit for definitely as luminous
which I like that looks really pretty
and as covering my sports is making
yellow tone which is what I usually use
sort of covering up my redness really
nicely
I have you will be pumped no that's all
it or not these blend super easily
it's not safe really in on my skin or
anything like that it actually looks
pretty natural but still booger coverage
next we're going it with VP called
natural concealer in the shade zero
three and I'm just going to use this
underneath my eyes I keep it for all
their other usual sports and they were
actually use train touch just like any
blemishes currently marking Pat that and
politically blender as well
I thought that I'll actually connect all
the foundation presents point names
accord the foundations pay match I'm
looking to sweep some poser underneath
my eyes just to say that I'll do the
same thing my forehead and let road
memos that was made based legislate put
some bronzer on so bringing you my key
called flawless fusion bronzer pose oh
and there's a good taste of the
foundation to see if the vulnerables on
smoothly with both coated and all over
because that is something i really like
to do i think the finish is really play
the blonde is going on smoothly thank
goodness and i'm just going my brows are
slightly smaller brush and I'm just
going to do so the middle of as usual
that is the main space basically I have
a stockpile of these eyeshadows but as
the water water I struggle and she 204
the use it as a highlight so I get a
little brush pick up do you see that
this is a Kiko eyeshadow 200 these ways
crazy viral available to use as a
highlighter because it is like a total
way looking highlight and I don't know
why I don't use in a while but it's
beautiful Hercules is a I'm defending it
right up here Cupid wall oh my girl now
I'm going to swap over a little
eyeshadow brush and we're going to 10
mine the nose I'm just going to really
quickly head this blush time this is the
sheer diffusion and she'll blush to 0-3
a really cute pink go to your colors it
remains a little shimmer brick but all
matte maybe a semi matte and we're just
going to brighten up the cheeks and I
like to do this after highlight cuz it
just kind of ties everything together
and I'm just using it to keep cool
number 10 brush this would be really
good sauce piquante and actually now
we're in a quicker pop open do my brows
and my eyeshadow primer
and I'll be back and a hot sake and then
it so now I have my eyebrows on we're
going to do our makeup I'm going you win
okay so I've got some cool stuff to see
rest the first thing as the active blue
eye shadow palette and it's key cool by
Arthur a basic scholarship accounts in
injury so if you're look guys for the
pilot is super bright so we're going to
use a little bit of it but the first
thing I'm going to do it is going to
take my Bruins art from earlier and I'm
going to start building up my crease so
this is a really good way if you don't
have transition shades and your palette
you can just use your bronzer it's
always going to be a really nice warm
tool as long as you're both good max I
should say that this one is just in the
face of the brush that they helps in
that a little bit just the years you
guys you know in a little window wiper
movements that's nice see that's a
really soft crease which if your mind
and it's a bat mascara and that's a
really beautiful deal with we're not
doing neck a day no no no sir and I'm
actually going to go ahead and I'm going
to buff a little bit left underneath my
eye and this is a good check to stop any
creasing happening if you just buff your
bronze all right right underlie I guess
delusion really soft shadow also stock
your under eyes and creases industry
really like a really nice I mentioned
today a really good starting point for
an eye makeup now I'm going to go in
with the best shades here it's just
called shades number of two and the
palette so it's just a really nice kind
of tangerina color and I'm going to do
the exact in fairness start building
that up and macri's think this lips can
end up being like a really pretty sunset
type and then I'm kind of taken that
shade and I'm going on to the leather or
so slightly and then I'm going to use
the side of the brush just to start
buffing that out now I'm going to go in
with a slightly more dense brush and
this pink shade and I'm going to do
pretty much the same thing but just more
onto the lids and moving a focused and
rate and Max fees payments given either
eyeshadows
they're millions and really easily and
these colors are actually super fatty or
green eyes and blue eyes specifically
because they will sleep really really
contrast and then obviously pink will
contrast with the brain ages immensely
to know I'm going to run with a smaller
brush again it's got a nature can
appoint to it and I'm going to go in
with the pink and the purple kind of
mixed together and reputable Antony fry
the start will and that I've Martha just
gonna push the end of the park pal and
then back into brush from earlier and
we're going to use the pink - really
although okay I'm actually with the prep
I'll load onto the lid a little bit and
then I'm going into my big fluffy
eyeshadow brush with the tangerine color
and I'm just going to blend all that it
makes you super blue note and that my
friends is a great as I'm going to go to
eyes because I'm actually doing a pink
lip today I normal I'm clearly a loss
that officially lost it if I preventable
in fact with our highlighting water I
shadow and winner partners and a coroner
and the reason it's called a water I
shadow because you can use on way or dry
and use it dry it's super pigmented so
if you were to use it way it would be
career and I'm just going to highlight a
brave one please a little black and Hank
now I'm going to use the key call
unmeasurable link mascara and black
obviously and we're going to start
building up these lashes gives me long
bottom lashes all over the sky is it's
really weird brushes that end up being
really good ah
pull pull most of the night oh my gosh
two balls even for mascara and then I
pull myself in this week and I was gonna
be okay baby be careful when you're
doing
I died letsa knew it Wow
I'm going to quickly set some lashes on
and then we're going to do our lips
which is probably the thing I'm most
excited for because a I'm not going lips
for years on YouTube
I just never do a pink lip and B it's
not just a let's take it off from
Sevilla cool it kind of freaked me out
but it's in pain I'm obsessed so two
seconds lashes are all in yet let's do
that I mean favorite way to show you
guys
so basically NZ stuff I got saying I
would say these three pencils one of
which is black one is a kind of bright
pink and then one's more of a cool prank
so when the warm pink and one's a cool
pink
I definitely think much all that until a
red neon same now listen entre great
usually are
so I'm going to do this what's first on
a shipment and also pmfs actives little
neon Neal lacquer and I was playing
spoon so put on one of my nails and it
instilled normal if they put on your
kisser
so I'll show you the lipstick and I'll
show you what it does
so I'm going to twist it up on the bar
if I'm on sharpening pencil mu sterlet
the would later goes super creamy
the almost rainy of the Urban Decay lip
liners are kind of clearly within the
dry zone
super matte and waterproof and I'm going
to check this lipstick one so that let
that pain film is called zero one and
there's lipstick if you'll do what is
real so they match it's definitely been
mat perfect and then there's me with a
bright strings look so the name is
amazing it does make your teeth look
yellow Google quit late seventies a with
the pink eye in the pink lipstick I bet
all that yesterday I like a cactus I can
I put a little bit of makeup trade oh
it's all that foot care so I saw and
then I painted my one nail and people
watch the corners
why you see me on look at great but I'm
not sure a name I'm a little boxes all
day and this is basically a blue light
now I'm going to make this room as dark
as possible to show you guys what
happens under blue lately you deal a car
dog
oh my light see here's our code so this
is a dark doesn't get my room returned
I'm a little light can you see that I'm
finally I don't have a bright or light
but if you can see I struggle to focus
look I'm here yeah oh my god you can see
me nice so that blue light basically
makes is like Guzzi cool wall Goudas and
it makes some little like white it's
amazing it's amazing so I'm going to
show you swatch these so there's a black
pencil and the RL super to me for the
black one you could use like it's a
phase let and body painful so imagine
you were going to a festival like a rush
I had best for Coachella honestly living
so stick around here wouldn't like a
festival or something I used to practice
oh excuse me
I'm just getting some swatches in the
back of my hand and you'll see the
difference in the two pink to a lipstick
because when I've got one as I would
Isley from me is a lot more readable
because I want such a cool toned pink if
I get really close oh you see it there
to look at the black chains like blue
and then these go super super bright
it's crazy and then my nail chains neon
as well so even like the nail polish is
second imagine you had these on in the
club and everyone thinks that you're
like tragically play make happen in your
left start shading freaking UV this
amazing social idea so you guys that is
the finished look I hope you like that
it's been a little bit different for me
just because it's pink wet
honestly I never do a pink light but
when I tried it on I actually quite
liked it I think the last time I tried
to go pink lip I had bright here a
little just a little bit a little bit
too much for me
