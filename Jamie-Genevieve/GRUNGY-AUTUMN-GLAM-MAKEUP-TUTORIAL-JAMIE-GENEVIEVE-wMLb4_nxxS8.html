color obviously eyes on something very
true to mas tail this is my jam right
here keep an eye out over on Instagram
reserve because there will be a
competition to win 500 pounds worth of
Kult beauty goodies as you guys like to
see how I created this whole look then
please stay tuned lick and there's a TV
with my face on it I can see it's my
focus first thing I'm gonna do it would
prep my skin so I'm going to use my fav
K press and helps didn't do you can see
how much I use this and I'm going to use
the Kapus Helio tropic pot of shade this
is my SPF so first of all the
antioxidant do and I just drop
four little drops on my face they rub
them in and end it for the heliotrope
egg sunscreen I just get about that much
you really don't do much of this stuff
at all
and it's not the cheapest so probably
good thing
the next product I'm going to use as the
Neal this is the photography fluid or
pasty 12%
I don't completely understand this
product but all my good witzy see it
so I'm just gonna do two drops on each
cheeks you don't need much this at all
and that stuff is not super expensive
I've seen loads of people raving about
it online but what they say is you use
it underneath your foundation or you can
use it by itself and it totally sorts
out your skin tone and it goes you're a
really nice radiant look on your skin I
bloody love that and apparently it makes
your skin look amazing in photography as
well it's almost like it looks a little
bit like an illuminator but it does we
more than that so now we're skins all
crepes we're actually gonna do it eyes
first so I'm gonna use the next proof it
waterproof eye shadow primer and I'm
just gonna pop a little bit up this
one's quite translucent but I've heard
really good things about this I'm just
gonna pull a little bit on and it's
gonna blend that it was my fingers and
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna
get eyes first because we're using some
glitter and then we're gonna do our
foundation and then we're gonna do our
Brides know that primers on I'm going to
take my next HD finishing powder in the
shade
banana and I'm just going to pop a
little bit of that over my lids but I'm
really working that into the paper I
don't want any sticky parts the palette
invidiously is the Venus to by Lane
creme and I'm really excited because
they're gonna realize that they stalk
their Sun cult beauty but this is one of
my favorite palettes and it went missing
the makeup artist so these are the
colors here I absolutely pussy look this
palette I'm gonna use the shade mustard
first and I'm gonna start building up my
crease I'm just using a fluffy brush
actually zoom you in I'm just gonna use
that mustard shade and my crease and go
backwards and forwards and start to
build up that transition shade this is
your deep transition shade if you need
to you can go in with a lighter color
first the reason that I absolutely love
warm colors and my crease is because
I've got pretty nice it contrasts really
really nicely but the same goes for blue
eyes it looks great with blue eyes and
it looks really beautiful and
complementary with brown eyes as well
and also warm shades just seem to blend
a lot easier they give a really
beautiful transition and you can always
use like a cool color on the lid or
something if you really want it to
contrast so what I'm doing is I'm
building up the crease and then like
usual I'm trying to my brush on its side
just to start bringing that out into the
skin a little bit now I'm going to go
end it with the shade jam and I'm going
to go in with the same brush and I'm
gonna start building up that orange
color and the crease and then I'm going
to bring it into the inner corner as
well see a lovely warm has a little bit
I think as palette it's parasol perfect
for awesome winner with these grungy
warm tones if you need to you can mix
those two shapes together just to help
the colors blend on the lids and it
helps give you that super buff that
effect I'm going to bring those two
colors and mix them together a little
bit I'm gonna bring them right and to my
inner corner kind of just like in here
this just gives a total MIDI MIDI look
to the eye
what's my favorite I'm gonna take a
fluffy brush with this shade Jam just
here and I'm gonna start buffing that
under my eye justice
who the shapes go ahead and making sure
le cat and also having that orange right
underneath the lash line
contracts with the lashes so when we put
a little mascara on it will look super
defined so you can see my green eye
colors poppin then when it going with a
little bit more of that orange shade job
and just go in my crease again my god
pumpkin eyes or war now I'm going to go
in with the shade mud which is just here
it's like the most gorgeous deep
cranberry color and I'm just gonna go in
with those leave a two to seven I'm
gonna start applying that in the crease
but onto the legs a little bit as well
and this is it's gonna be a nice first
step because we're gonna put some cuts
it on when I was a makeup artist
these are my favorite colors to use on
pretty much everybody because they're
either gonna contrast in a really
beautiful way or they're gonna
complement the eye color I think that is
the most people that's probably why you
mostly see warm eye colors you don't you
tube more warm I'd tutorials and I'm
gonna go in with a little bit about mud
shades and I'm gonna buff it with my
fluffier brush from earlier now that
most of my eye shadow is done I'm
actually gonna go in with the touch
insole non-stop swiss black eyeliner
it's got the same brush type as the NYX
eye later that I really like and I'm
gonna use this I'm gonna get our super
dramatic wing like old-school Jamie
so the way I'm gonna do that I'm gonna
start with the lane coming out of my eye
and I've just drawn it back just to the
very edge of my smoky eye okay
there's other side
boom so easy to use the subtle way no
I'm really intrigued about this brand
actually I saw when I was in a major car
and everything was sold oh it's like the
new k-beauty that the it thing now I'm
gonna take my next glitter glue
absolutely love this stuff so affordable
just as good as any other glitter glue
my favorite and I'm gonna put this on
all over my life and ever gonna put some
of the SATA he'll bless her and they
shade lick me wait Lisa daesil gorgeous
and SATA hell as a beauty brand from
Scotland so look at that color
okay oh my god just went all over my
desk bloody hell it's gonna take a while
you know so it's really dark really kind
of grungy oh my god it's literally all
over my body so I'm just gonna Pat
that's quite a glue all under my legs
I'm not worried about my liner and I'm
gonna have to go over that again anyway
and the reason I picked this shade is is
the cause it's a super deep Auburn that
will look so gorgeous with this look
super autumnal and then a little check
I've got is the brush that I use to
apply the glitter glue
I'm gonna go street and to the glutes
out with this brush and that means that
the glitter will stick to the brush as
well so there's less fallout and I'm
just taking my time to put that on
now that the clutters on I can see that
the rest of my eye look is not dark
enough for us so what I'm gonna do when
he was ashamed mud and a fluffy brush
and I'm just gonna blend just where the
glitter looks a little bit those join
egg I'm just gonna pack some shadow and
we're just gonna make this a little bit
smoky a little bit darker so I'm just
blending that much shade right into the
inner corner and then I'm gonna go back
in with my fluffy brush and just blend
that deep shade again know that the
glare Zorin I'm going to go back in with
my black liner and I'm just gonna go
over
my last thing but honestly I find it a
lot easier going back over later rather
than going on topic literally straight
away it just does not work for me and
other eye shadow slash million products
I've got to tell you about are the new
bleach london single shadows these are
three pounds each
and I'm gonna take this super yellow
gold and I'm gonna pop it in my inner
corner and I tell you what it reminds me
off flippin totally amazed by Fanny B so
I'm going to take a little firm brush
and pick up some of that leaf or that
pigment for a frequent so I've got a
little pilot made up here and they do
loads of cute rates so for three pounds
each and pray and pray and yellow is my
favorite color in the world I'm gonna
pop on my mascara this is the benefit
roller lash mascara but before I stick
that one I'm going to take my Samantha
lashes by her WT I've not used these in
absolutely ages but there was such a
favorite of mine for so long they're
just really gorgeous and West be
beautiful and because of the little
rounded plastic brush is so easy to get
your thought and lashes nice and build
up a problem I've been having with
summer scatters lately is that the canna
seem to melt onto my face a little bit
through the day like dark patches down
here with my concealer and stuff I did
not get that with this mascara I'm gonna
take my little lash star fill this is
just like a really easy eyelash
applicator to I'm gonna pop these
brushes on they're so fluffy lookin for
synthetic lashes so now that my eyes are
done I'm liking this pray crazy with no
foundation or brace on so we're gonna
fix that so the first thing we do is I'm
going to take my quarterly beauty elixir
I love this stuff a dry note for EJ's
but I just got a pack
I'm gonna take some of that on a cotton
pad and I'm just gonna clean away any of
that glitter that fill my face and now
it's time for skin primer I'm gonna use
it's the touch and salt feel like honey
feel like honeymoon skin bees and I'm
just gonna put some of that in the back
of my hand
it's so speculate look at this but this
is this is what was sold out all the
primers from this brand or sold out when
I saw them in store
oh my god it feels so good it smells it
great don't have to feel that sticky and
matte face this is so bizarre
and once that's on I'm gonna take one
pump of my Baker ultimate coverage
complexion cream one pump of l'air my
lesson you did not need much of this
stuff at all but I used to use this all
the time and I went away from it just
because I was trying other stuff but it
will always be one of my favorites and
I'm just gonna blend that into my skin
have you cleaned oh that's that's great
it's really really good coverage the
color I use is the shade nude such good
coverage and I like to probably put the
most coverage right on my nose just
because that is where my foundation
seems to fall off during a date see her
good coverage that is one pump man the
colors not on my Bridget I'm not too
worried about going all through them a
little bit I do looks so much like old
school dear me like their dark eyes and
pale things now that my foundation is on
I'm gonna go ahead and take a little
angled like blood blending brush and I'm
gonna go in with the RMS Beauty
uncovered up concealer and shit 22 this
stuff has had so much height on Lane
I've used it a little bit but I'm not
used to and I still look before so I'm
very excited to see what the deal is so
I'm going to miss that brush and I'm
just gonna go under my eyes and using a
little brush like those as a maze don't
forget and the coverage that you need
underneath your eyes without damage
your eye makeup okay it looks like skin
I'm not joking it looks like nothing is
there but it does cover so really nice
texture think Whitley that we must go
let's know that can see there's really
weird it's like really light coverage
but if those cover what you needed teeth
I'm gonna take my Becca bronze born died
sunlit bronzer and I'm gonna just use
the same brush here and I'm gonna warm
up my face and for me the color I like
to use for bronzer as pretty warm I just
love it because it warms up my skin it
always complements my eye color I think
I've got a lot of mix of both undertones
I think I'm pretty pretty yellow
undertone but I do have more told paint
through my skin as well helping a lot of
their Scottish Henry Carr neck so I just
like to use a nice warm bronze and then
when it comes to highlight our exact
same I love a gold a warm champagne a
highlighter and I'm just warming up all
the key points my face like think of it
like a kind of butterfly and already I
can see that I'm starting to look more
human and that bronze there is a really
lovely texture I just thought like plain
straight into this guy and I only got
this about a week ago but I've been
using at Tynan's and I just like the way
it blends really easily into my skin
obviously I don't powder my whole face
at all so I need a bronzer that's going
to go on really nice and easily blend
nicely no craziness and this is that
really nice tour and it's can i light
this god can i really undertones in it
but basically it's not her orange for me
because I do like to use quite a lot of
bronzer to add a little contour to my
skin I'm going to swap my brush a little
smaller one I'm gonna go in with my
Cavanaugh corn sculpting powder and
medium and this has got that really nice
a sheet one but it's not too dark so it
basically creates like a perfect shadow
on your face so I think sometimes it can
get a little bit twisted see when you
start using - one more color to contour
that's what it can start looking
that crazy so we're going to use this
just right at the holes of our
cheekbones and that's how you get a nice
contour and I feel like to you it's just
a little touch of that doing the same
for my nose I'm actually going to mix it
with the bronze Oh after that my contour
and I like to call em of the bronzer one
more time and just go over make sure
that everything is nicely blended this
is the nude specks highlight Inbal face
lip and I knew T's you'll have seen it
on Instagram but this is the shade
alumina aid and it comes with a little
brush on those sides which I won't be
using not gonna lie but on this side it
goes it's also kind of glossy Barham but
it picks up the light saw beautifully so
the way I'm going to use is I'm gonna go
in with my fingers and because my
foundation is still mat see the glue it
gave sure this is a little bit at a
decent pink which is funny because I do
usually use a gold any color but because
it's like a bomb it's saying if it was a
pure intense pink eyelet or I wouldn't
be using it but because it's like a
glossy BAM I really like it oh it's
beautiful it's so easy to use and this
is the kind of thing that would look
absolutely amazing if you didn't wear
foundation so if you were just I don't
know going to the gym or school run if
you don't have time to do the Phil
foundation if you put a little touch of
this just where I'm putting it
cheekbones and your turn poles it gives
you such a youthful pearly pink igloo I
just look super healthy and if you need
to you can use your beauty blender just
to push that into the skin take away any
excess and smooth it in Elaine's
this is the cover FX custom enhancing
drops and she'd sunlight this is Matt
horn blips I would put a little bit my
hand if you look right here it's like
super super reflective and super
champion II so I'm gonna take just that
little bit it was in my hand
and that is my
and I love a wet looking glow because it
does look more natural
not that I care about that but it does
just look so healthy what I usually say
healthy expensive skin sheers out the
look of your foundation so this
foundation that I've used this super
matte and super sec like silk coverage
which is great for me but I wanted just
a little bit added glow if you love it
here you stop you can stop here but I'm
going to put the tiniest little touch of
gilded honey by Laura Geller and this is
so gorgeous and I feel back in love with
it when I had to bother my friend
Amy's makeup boxes makeup for three days
and she loves this so I'm just gonna put
a tiny a little touch of this right on
my cheek bone in that set and though my
nose and when your lyric screams and
Pozos gives you much more of a kind of
3d gives you more depth and then I'm
gonna go in with a little eye shadow
brush and I'm just going to highlight
the end of my nose and just go in the
bridge just highlight my brow bone when
you use the kind of gaudy highlight or
like this it brings so much warmth to
the look and because it's been such a
warm eye it really complements oh my god
I feel something good no and if you've
done all the skin and when I go in with
my next powder and a little one to six
luxe cheek finish brush but I'm not
gonna use it for my cheeks and I'm just
gonna powder it just right under my eyes
and even though this is the shade banana
it has a little bit of color in it but
it's not too much and I'm just gonna do
it in between my brows as well and that
just mattifies my skin down a little bit
know that her face makeup is done I'm
gonna go in with my Anastasia Beverly
Hills
blow ways in the shade medium brown I
use this color
kano regardless of what my haircut is it
shows a super nice muted rose color you
can use it when you've got pink here
which I've had you use if you've got
fuel here which I've had
literally there are cannanore rules when
it comes to pros these days and I
obviously have quite an ashy route and
super blonde the ends so it suits me
perfect it's like right in between those
two colors and all zoom in a little bit
and if you feel like you need to warm up
your bro color at all you can use a
warmer row gel so the way that I do my
braids lately super quick so quick I'm
just gonna go and at the front nice and
the law down I just like the way that
that can I mix my arch a little bit more
dramatic
so basically create a line underneath
the braid here I use little sailor
strokes to create brow like Harry's just
at the Front's I don't want to make them
like a super block through and then I
get this Billy and just brush that
through and then I go straight to the
arch of the brow and I just build it up
and make Excite gives me more of a kind
of arch look so easy but it gives me the
look that one I don't really tend to do
that dramatic abreu on myself these days
just for cause my eye makeup so dramatic
my skin is usually really dramatic as
well so I just leave it there and then
to give the brows a little bit more
thickness and a little bit more color
and warm them up like I said earlier I'm
going to use the tented ratio by
anastasiya again and the shade chocolate
and I'm just gonna lightly start in the
metal of the drive and just work my way
through to the end this stuff's really
good it's like hairspray for your night
phrase it really does laughs and then at
the front I'm gonna cool the hair so I'm
also gonna get them to stand up a little
bit of straighter and I just gives my
face a little bit more stillness a
little bit more thickness a little bit
more shape but that is exactly I'm gonna
leave them right now and the last little
product I have is another new text
product I wanted to keep these in the
box to show you because when you buy a
product from them you get this really
cute little ten and then in the lid
there's a little matter so it's really
good for topping up on the goal and I
don't carry out so that much makeup with
me so it's really cool and then you get
a little lead that also as a sharpener
as well because these are quite chunky
playing cells so the lip color I'm going
to use is the shade entice and it is an
intense matte lip and cheek pencil so
you can use this on your lips in your
cheek as well and this is the color here
is a really really beautiful and I'm
just gonna pop that on but they are
really creamy do my usual Pat then I'm
gonna do my usual thing I'm gonna use a
lip liner named Philip like I'm gonna
use as next sweet
matte lip liner in the shade London and
I'm just gonna use this just as define
my lips a little bit more because I just
can't do the whole know that playing
everything it freaks me out and the note
sex lip pencil goes on super creamy but
it dries down really quickly I'm gonna
find out a little later on so you guys
that is the finished look I hope you
really liked that it was super fun to
team up with cold feet again obviously
you guys know that they're one of my
favorite peoples in the world so I
really really hope you liked this look
as always everything will be linked down
below all the stuff that I used and
things like that as well any kind of
chords that I mentioned earlier and all
the information that you will need
