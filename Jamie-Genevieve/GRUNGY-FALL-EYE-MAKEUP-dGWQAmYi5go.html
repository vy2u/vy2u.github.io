I'm going to show you how to do this
grungy autumn a smoky eye hey I could
try and make it colorful I asked on
Twitter I'm gonna do a colorful makeup
look what color would you like to see
and the most popular by far was like
orange and prep pulp so I was like okay
I'm gonna mix orange and purple together
and it's turned a low dose and I was
like this isn't great I swear I'll bring
out a colorful one and it really really
soon but if you wanna see how I create
this eye makeup stay tuned and if you
want to see how I created the skin I
have done my first connect Instagram
videos so you can check out on my
Instagram which is just Jimmy Genevieve
and yeah I hope you like it Boop okay
I'm going to show you how to this eye I
have already claimed my eye with leading
law Primera pin port I know people
struggle to understand me when I see
this product by what they blow and the
pilot we're going to use there is des LM
icicle and I feel like me cannot
remember what it's called by will the
cut up and I'll pop at the law but it
I'm really beautiful I think it's the
rose gold pilot I'm not sure but even
it's fantastic for all because you've
got all these kind of warm colors you've
got your nice tarnish shimmers and
you've got news particles as well so to
me the colors look quick bright and
palette and then in terms of put them on
my ball it became a grungy smoky eye a
mattifying the plane wrote with this
color here and then I'm going to use
this color here for the transition
shades mixed with a little bit this
orange and then we're going to pack on
this really dark purple on the lid sort
of actually I'm using my Mac two to four
brush and Alaska shadows are beautiful
obviously they are very very pigmented
and they give a really beautiful
finished eye makeup but one thing I will
say they're not the easiest to work with
you have to put a little bit more time
and effort and love and care into your
eyeshadow
that's fine but it is worth it that's
why I'm CMDA and then when you're
blending these shadows I'm using went
away for movements with my brush kind of
face and outgrowth and then to the side
I just tackle the site with the end of
my brush and that helps submit out no
we're going with that beautiful dark
orange and we're going to start getting
that smoke and the crease
and I love that using colors like this
underneath my eye without the pulse I'm
going to do that today
and I'm just using my Smith 2 4 7 brush
for that mmm is I'm not sure beautiful
and I'm just going to blend that it with
a little bit of the transition shade and
my 2 to 4 brush now I'm going to pack on
with a little to leave a brush this is
just like the classic shades or brushes
and I'm going to pack on this dark
purple color here and we're going to see
her back with I really like the
assortment of colors in this palette as
well there's enough to get a little look
to it and if you are a fan of matte
eyeshadows lmax is definitely start a
brand that you should look at because
they are the math test was pigmented
shadows when I worked for illamasqua I
learned using these eyeshadows so when I
went to like makeup geek I find it
really easy to blend everything together
on genetics and mix in the burnt orange
and the dark purple of my tutu for brush
from Mac and I'm just mixing it together
and I'm going to use that to help me
blend I like to help my head back so I
can see that Lima creases and just buff
those colors together with the meat but
we clean off on my sweatpants put a
little bit more of that purple
and then something I love to do is just
highlight upright born with that shaped
here I think this is slink there's no
additional listed shadows on this
palette because its own a prf package
but I'm sure it's linked with what other
mice conceal secretly and it's the most
gorgeous bro Haley is really for
highlight in your face as well and see
that I'm going to go back up with my
tofu for a tiny bit of that shimmery
shadow and I love using that just to
help diffuse up here now I'm gonna pop
some glue on my lashes these are really
cute little ones from tire the new Tarte
Pro range
please don't ask for tape there I know
they're just the West Beach Pier but I'm
just going to glue those up with my do
glue the green brush-on glue the glue is
not actually getting I think someone
thought I was meaning that I mean the
little bit that says dual screen and
then I'm going to use my mad large black
mascara I just found this when I was
cleaning through my makeup yesterday and
I put it on and it's great and it's got
a really nice curved brush so you can
get right on it your lashes it has a
news I'm I'm a fan of it and it gets
your bottom lashes really well okay shut
this lower lash on I've got nails again
so I need to use tweezers and now I'm
just going to let that dry a little bit
and then I'm going to give them a lot of
squish together but I love my makeup it
reminds me so much of when I worked for
other masks I used to do this kinda make
up all the time and I would use daughter
ki liquid lipstick from Kylie eye I
bought like four things from her and the
last time I used a gloss and loved it
and then I tried this out yesterday and
it's beautiful so I'm gonna fire this on
no lipliner
concretely
ah perfect for full I'm just going to
fill in my little freckle with my
benefit red pencil number four and
that's a finished look you guys I really
did try to make this a colorful look I
swear I hope you liked this tutorial and
I will see anything
