I would assure you pretty much forget
this entire look I am using some fun new
products actually it's mostly new
products and yet pretty much just wanted
to do a makeup tutorial like the good
old days a nice grungy spotlight i it's
been a little while as you guys like to
see how actually it this look then
please stay tuned we're gonna do eyes
first they see you however you eat and
i'm a hot tamale today i am using an
exciting new product from iconic London
that's as the new eyeshadow palette so
I'm going to do my eye first obviously
you can see exactly what I'm doing right
here it's very grungy sultry spotlight
eye
the first thing I'm going to do is take
my Mac Paint Pot in laying low and I'm
gonna prick Mac prep my eyelid I'm using
my zwieback concealer buffer brush just
think I think slate layer of that oil
and I usually use my Beauty Blender but
because I've done my eyebrows first I
just went a little bit more precision
but when it went everywhere and I'm
actually gonna use a little bit of this
under my eye as well and that really
helps take any darkness we like look
it's actually a really good color
corrector no this palette comes with a
mirror on the top and then you've got
your 20 sheets gonna show you guys color
amusing and point this I'm going to use
this color first just to mattify mullet
and then I'm gonna go in with this shade
here the kind of peachy color and I'm
just gonna start building that up in the
crease this is quite a light eyeshadow
so it's not really dark enough from our
transition shade but I'm just using that
just to start building building
something up you know it's actually
really gorgeous by itself if you're
wanting more of a match a natural d look
now we've done that and we will end with
this shade here which is a really pretty
burnt orange kind of transition shade
everybody just do the exact same thing
and I've been quite firm with my brush
and I'm going in those went away from
movements and then I'm gonna use the
sight of my brush to start taking that
out because even though we're doing a
spotlight I are really don't
my salute to Rend because they'll just
go with my big room fees we were in an
inner corner as well build that up
no I'm swapping it with my is we bought
34 and this shade here is the darkest
color in the palette so became a dark
chocolate brain and I'm gonna start
really building on this eye and I'm just
gonna start building that on the outer
corner and inner corner I'm trying to
keep that just in the outer corners
well the in the corners right now I
don't want to bring it to the middle too
much and then to help like that I'm
gonna go end with this sheet here it's
kind of like a rosy red and I'm gonna
use that if I brush cannot on its side
and I'm going to go over that dark brown
matte you're gonna take that rate
through the crease because it really
helps the depth of the lytic we start
getting all those colors now I'm going
to go in with the dark shade again and
we're just gonna start packing out on
top again Oliver I added a little bit
the pigment at the time and then I'm
gonna go in with orange shade and go
under I just with the same brush that
spot the center of the lid I'm going to
use this sheet here and it look at this
pigment really good the shimmers in this
palette are included in trade so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take my
two four seven brush get that pigment on
the brush and then squish it with my all
nighter spray bartkey and Skoosh means
pre Scott terminology and I'm just gonna
press that look at that it's bright I
passed that on to Mullen I like to do
this with my eyes half-full pen so I can
see that I'm putting it in the right
place because if you do a spotlight in
the wrong place it can make you look
like you've got
all slightly crossed eyes while we're on
the shimmer portion I'm gonna highlight
my browbone it before going in and
making sure I'm happy with the eye
shadow and I'm going to highlight my
browbone with this color here it is
again so bright I definitely love the
shimmers in this palette and I'm just
using that dry on my brow bone and it's
nice because the shimmer in the middle
of the eye is obviously gold and then
around the braid Bourne is more of a
chemical pink tone so it kind of
differentiates it a little bit now I'm
just going in with the darkest color
again and we're just gonna make sure
that everything is nice and blended and
intense and I bring in the dark brown
shade slightly up onto the upper crease
just so I can get that kind of winged
out shape I quantified and also brought
a new range Bob lashes these are 3d self
lashes so they're not mink
they are silk and I've already got it on
here and I really really like him so I'm
gonna glue that up this veil is called I
doesn't say over my books I mean I've
had the taste box or I'll look up for
you and I'll link it down below
but I really like these so if you look
they're really really fluffy and they're
right days which means that the kind of
peak and the middle but they've got
these names gaps which are going to make
it really really easy to see the
spotlight so it's me so I'm actually
gonna trim from either end so I keep the
medal too long guys
oh excuse my nails by the way I was
shooting yes and my here actually so I
was shooting yesterday and I had to get
my nails P and Ed's
and he doesn't turn either them very
very good I don't think that the lady
has been a nail tech for too long but I
need to get them done tomorrow
mm-hmm now I'm gonna stuck on a cure
shadows I'm going to use the benefit
roller lash and the Rimmel scandaleyes
reloaded both of these together make for
really good chunky long lasting lashes
so use the scandalize first but I'm
going to use benefit roller lash on tap
and it really separates the lashes it's
good well we're in for that last to dry
I've got a kind of new thing in my
routine and it's just when I've been on
holiday because obviously see if you
look great great time so my body it
always gets a much better tan than my
face and I am over it so what I do know
is when I'm getting ready I'll either do
my makeup first and then Skoosh lifts or
scooch this before doing anything but
this is the refreshing coconut tanning
water from Newton and tone and basically
it's a really nice coconut
facial spritz that has thick tan in it
and it's fully builds up a tan which
makes my skin look healthier obviously
more glowy it's more hydrated and the
time itself helps make my skin more even
if you know what I mean so I'm going to
spray this so put that on first and then
I'll use my chi press heliotrope pick
sunscreen and I'll spoke about this and
the last two videos but I'm all about
that SPF I want to look like a newborn
baby both whoo I'm 60 so I'm just gonna
block the Senate before anyone asks no
you do not get feet and fingers doing
this because you're just rubbing the
product then and I always wash my hands
after somebody a cup enemy so just make
sure you do that and you'll be saying
since I've been using this sunscreen as
a primer oh my goodness my makeup lasts
so long if I was doing that photo shoot
yesterday my makeup was on from food
8:00 in the morning until 8:00 in the
morning until 6:00 at night and I was
doing shooting so basically that's under
like really strong weights and it was
really really hot in the studio as well
so yeah I'm a big fan
everybody's it forever alas is still dry
in time actually zoom you out right now
so I'm gonna start on my foundation so
I'm going to dream a little favorite
cornball which is might artistic
foundation in the shade tan sand and the
Make Up For Ever HD sick and achieve
wise feet six fries and it's just my
favorite thing about it honestly the
easiest it takes to save Kenz I do use
more of the tart stick to be fair and I
just use this in the middle just for a
little bit of extra doing this and also
to make the color just a slight touch
later then I'm going to get my heels
dearly deriving concentrate my life my
soul never is gonna drop that on my face
and I'm just gonna do it on my cheeks
and I tend to be because I don't think I
need on my forehead I think my forehead
can get great shaking itself drive me
try really really quickly sorting this
is much my motions I've tried this brush
a couple times and really liked her it's
called the blank canvas cosmetics it's
all eight brush yeah CEOs great and it's
so much faster than a Beauty Blender do
you see how I mean it's literally two
seconds and then I'll leave under my
eyes for a concealer and Beauty Blender
that's what I'll do
yeah I'm happy with that okay when you
can see up well oh my gosh great so I
just shoved that on hmm I like that
see those lashes are really gorgeous
honestly I am gonna be needing to stock
up on those okay concealer I'm just
gonna use my Tarte shape tape and the
shades tan for this I have a few little
red marks on my head because pics my
face I want to build up the coverage of
my chin under my eyes obviously I'm not
gonna put too much under my eyes and
then I want to do a in the face of mine
or
and then I would have Beautyblender and
I think when I'm focusing on coverage
and we don't want it to go that's when I
like to use a booty playing dope yeah
right under my eyes I don't want to
change in either eyeshadow so I'm just
taking my time oh my god I don't have a
drop right here at my nose this is sworn
to da ting now I'm going to use my sheet
and light my cat onesie I don't think
I've actually used this that many times
but I saw someone use it and it looked
really nice so I'm going to use this
yellow torn under my eyes to say it and
to brighten them up and actually wake up
and I'm gonna use it just in all the
high points of my face I'm gonna use my
eye shadow brush that I use for my eye
makeup and I'm just gonna run that over
a bit of conceals near my eye shadow
just so it kind of blends in a little
bit more okay I got a delivery today
from makeup forever and I got a couple
of new things and I want to try them so
the first one is make up forever
profusion bronzer someone was talking
about this and said it was amazing and
I've wanted to try it since and I'm sure
it was Verizon Ali I'm gonna just use
this with my Charlotte Tilbury blush
brush it's really creamy oh I love that
gonna bring it down my neck I'm going to
use my little buddy brush the powder and
sculpt brush I'm just gonna focus a
little bit on my cheekbones that guys
that make me run a favorite bronzer is
the creamiest powder over it doesn't
look oily asshole it doesn't look dry
that's gorgeous and the color of it is I
think it's number two so just open do it
full fusion to side L 2 Phi by make up
forever
need to sort your numbers or your color
system because it's a nightmare
I'm going to go back in with a Kat Von D
and I'm gonna go in with that pie chart
the banana type one you want to try it
on
yep I try underneath your contour this
is marvelous
oh my god I love that one so ok
highlight I think I just want to use all
parts okay I'm gonna use Becca or pal my
all-time favorite highlighter of all
time multi in fear powder highlighter
should say and the one three four brush
from zoeva you guys if you don't have
either of these things then you need to
sort a dust brush and this for highlight
and it's just the dream so I'm gonna
blaze the cheatboys I know
feel it like an angel I want to bronze
under my nose I'm going to just get a
little touch death I'm actually late
with that and I can't help but feel like
I just wouldn't do like a nudie lip with
not much commitment just like a good
luck by itself it's the Rimmel liquids
lip color steamer and the shade marker
and a tiny gesture day it was really
nice yellow just there and it honestly
feels sore nice I may actually lane this
I'm going to use my Charlotte Tilbury
iconic nude just to line this a little
bit I just feel like it's almost too
close to my skin tone it's not light
enough for actually for me I like it to
be later than my skin tone
and I'm done that was actually not that
long lastly I'm just gonna grab a little
touch of my Charlotte Tilbury airbrush
boys finished skin perfecting my trip
out there and achieve number two I don't
just go to mattify my saying are ever so
slightly just want the goal to be on the
cheeks today you know and that you guys
is the finished look I really hope you
like that and I realize it's been hot
sick since it in a spotlight I I know
