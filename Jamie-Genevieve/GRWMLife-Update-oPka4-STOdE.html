week we are going to get ready together
and I am going to update you on my
little life so a woman in my makeup area
is a maze I'm just gonna do my makeup
like I have been doing it the last few
weeks because I have been very very busy
so I've not had as much time so I
thought that this would be a good one
drop out you're sniffing around my stand
and you're making a bow bow Oh giving me
good oh you're so nice thank you going
to your breakfast trip being silly
ah have you been doing nah let's do
makeup so I thought I would record this
because I'm I've been getting really
super quickly these days and because
I've been so fancy
so just now and I'm just going on in
bothering facespace
by the way as always so just know in
Scotland as in prom season so basically
all the people that are graduating from
University all people that are
graduating from high school are all
going to the prom so I know that you
guys do that in America as well and it
didn't used to be as big a deal but it
is now as no it's a huge deal
hmm oh my breath excuse me I just had to
go in there drop by it for the PE table
and always to jungle the keys with his
nose and that's his way of telling us
that he needs pee so I've taken my site
so I just at that and then run upstairs
and their breath because I am really
unhealthy okay so I put my Bobbi Brown
face based on language of my foundation
now so I'm going to make a concoction in
better our ultimate coverage complexion
cream and the shades knit one pump this
is quite wild by the way you don't need
to do this if you don't want Y sale
Tricia Claire no formula in BD sixty
it's a little dark for me that's okay
one pump and then I'm actually going to
put a little drop of
it matter Cujo loyal I'm going to put
two e drops of that that he dropped suck
it I'm going to be gooey and I'm just
going to put that one with most mess one
one five brushes all this so I'm mixing
that in the back of my hand my boss is
very sorry I haven't recorded a gator
this mean so long since we before I went
Skyler so it happened since then I
highly recommend going to Sam's channel
and watching our vlogs if you don't know
we have been or what we've been doing
the close I think if Sam's for last
vlogs I'm actually cost on three of them
so basically we just bombed the boat and
had to boost him about it we went all
the different places it was amazing
and the end of whatever blogs she
figured out that we've been like I don't
know how many countries like five
different countries name definitely
cities or something like that and it's
basically two months which is crazy so
yeah we've had a really good time and
then I came home Sam came home with me
we had a little bit of pain in Scotland
and then we both got so sick so sick so
Sam had some cane I gastric thing oh my
god this is the Julius Twain dish never
a pill my face this is incredible I mean
I had glandular fever which I've had
before actually and it's one of those
ones it lasts in your body for ages or
once you have it once you get a kid in
so I just think I was quick rundown I
was working really hard and when we got
here I had master classes so I had
master classes with cynics in air
butcher's shop potato in Glasgow and
then I had my own ones so I put my own
classes on and onyx which is a sound
that I'm working and currently yeah so I
put on classes they were amazing they
were so much fun it was so nice to meet
everyone loser the Paley school farm
King which was really cool and just
putting on my NARS creamy concealer and
I saw someone do this and put that much
on and I was like what are you doing but
I want to try it but I feel like that's
a lot of products and I don't usually
use that much product in yeah so I had
my master classes in onyx which we agree
there was quite a lot of those as well d
after the classes we went with the
London
do a meet and greet with next and
obviously because we were both so sick
we had canceled and I he I hate that we
had to do that because I feel like I was
letting people down and I just hate that
I had to cancel a day in the cell line
because I was so sick and then had to go
to work on this fall and Saturday
socials on Tuesday and I had to go to
work on the fall inside because I had a
wedding and you're up spewing and my
braids house because I was so sick
luckily she doesn't mind because we knew
each other quite well by then and she
was just happy I was there doing the
makeup and then my monkey moaned and my
dad and they played me full of homemade
soup and natural remedies my mom makes a
mean antibiotic out of vegetables pretty
much you basically shot this medicine
and it's a can actual antibiotic and it
completely cured me there's no other way
to put it
so mama Genevieve came through and so
yeah that's what's been happening and
then after I recovered literally the D I
started feeling better I was back in a
salad at prom season so I think I had 43
clients in one week which is crazy so
basically this is a really rare debate
we are telling you if I have not been
doing videos when I was away in Canada I
am I left my camera out in the back of
an uber and took too long and by the
time I finally rang the girl who was
driving us around my counter was
mysteriously my same year right since
then I bought two more cameras because I
broke another one but I've got this one
and it's insured okay I'm going to sit
under my eyes with a little but chanel
poser
some fancy pants oh no I'm really not
I'm still wearing my pajama top in fact
and it's covered in dog hair because
I've been playing with drop running also
a little bit of news I am stopping
freelance makeup I've worked in onyx my
friend Natalie written in James cell on
for a year now and it's been amazing but
I've decided that I'm gonna start
freelance for the moment and I'm going
to focus on YouTube so that may cause a
shock to you
all because I hadn't been here for a
long time I am leaving
onyx this Elinor working and I'm just
going to be doing full time YouTube
because when I was traveling when I was
in America and Canada and stuff I was
really inspired because I was around all
these people that do Instagram you
shooting things like that feel time and
it's hard work it's much harder than I
thought when I first started doing
YouTube and there's a lot work that goes
into it especially if you want to be
uploading as frequently as I would like
to things like that so I'm but I'm feel
superior to commit to this work so what
I'm seeing is that you're going to see a
lot more of me and my youtube just doing
all I finished up on the 7th of August
all of these ups leading up to that I'm
still taking clients or into my books or
just fill them up to be honest which is
amazing and then I'm leaving and then
I've got a few trips laying that I'm
going to Alienware next and to the face
Awards which I'm so excited about I'm
really buzzing for that I'm hopefully
going to be Gordon true to Canada again
because it's Kerry another non joking
that was figure sound that was for you
yeah I'm just really excited I'm just
really excited
pretty much so I will ask on Twitter
available and when I was also stuck
actually what kind of videos and stuff
you guys like to see I've got tons of
videos ideas already which is good but
because I'm gonna be doing so much more
we can do in monthly favorites again and
why did them for a little while
basically what I'm asking is you guys we
can do forever the world's our oyster so
why don't you tell me what you would
like me to record my god
I tell you what I love this eye shadow
I'm sure it's called red earth so this
is like a super easy grind you look cuz
you're just I let you just find that eye
shadow underneath with nothing under
there a little bit of my eye shadow base
but that's it I'm not gonna put it on
top I just find underneath today
I'm glad Elena so I've been using Kat
Von D triple liner since I went away and
it's my favorite of all time so I'm
gonna do a wee flick in this goes right
or wrong sometimes
on my anxiety towards it but let's just
fingers crossed a little girl today
Michael this one just get longer and
longer until it's then okay they're not
too dissimilar that's gonna ruin my day
I'm not happy I feel like when the lash
is gone it's gonna get a little bare
like this one better than this one right
moving it in laughs I'm going to use our
Sudhir so there I think our create a new
brand the equalities arrived and my meal
and I tried them on and they're amazing
and I've had them on literally 20 times
and I'm trying to think of what else to
tell you guys I feel like I have not
been here for a while but surely more
things have happened and know what we
can do is highlight I'm just going to
try some new stuff I'm going to try the
tarte exposed highlight Amazonian clay
highlighter brand spanking new oh oh my
god thar what have you done one so
excited about that is I you guys you
guys know how I feel bit hi Leo

look like that in the pan does it and
obviously just proceed to put that all
over your face my girls were nice
okay feeling good about that and they
brought me so I'm leaving quite a lot i
swords dear man I'm feeling pasty and
I'm just using this Stila steel deep
line sir obviously I like it I just want
to be blamed so I'm just piling this on
my face and I've been working she's
aware is obviously but today I started
one a caulk announcement so what I
thought I would get up early take Jack
to work if you bought me my McDonald's
porridge which I've been eating every
morning because I can't cook porridge I
think point it is a difficult thing to
make but as McDonald's get it right if
we can and no it doesn't have a little
bits of sausage through it and what
doesn't have is weird it's literally
just porridge

out or my favorite lip color I did a
snapchat yes you're you heard me right

snapchat and this is a lip color
