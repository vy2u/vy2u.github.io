I am going to show you how to do this
proper glam dark dark dark dark dark
okay
it's been quite a while since I've done
something a little bit more mold sale
like grungy and the best so yeah I'm
going to show you how to do this is
perfect for everyone that's still got
Christmas night so it's going it new
year I think it's fabulous for or if
you're like me and I'm going to go to
the doctors and get jags for my holidays
because we're shopping because you're so
shopping the best fits your food I
really hope you guys like this video I'm
sorry I wasn't here away last week I'm
sorry I missed last week's video but I
am going to have a little doubler for
you to do so keep an eye out for an
extra video and I will see you next week
but if you'd like to see how I created
this latest a true okay
starting off raised my brush okay it's
that and off with soft orchid as always
just going to use a jewel fiber brush
tip pop that on I'm just using that all
over the eye right up to the concealer
and then I'm gonna use it underneath as
well prep then let's you good now for
the eyeshadows I'm going to be using the
semi-sweet chocolate bar from Too Faced
this is my first time using these
shadows and I really like them really
really like them so the first color I'm
gonna go on with is called mousse let's
color here like you can a nice topi
transition shade it's quite dark but I
like that for a transition shade and I'm
just using a makeup reduction cosmetics
brush just a really nice fluffy one and
we're going to pop that in the crease
now I'm not using too much product and
when I get to the brow I'm just going to
kind of blend that into the concealer to
get a nice soft blend and as you can see
it's quite hwangbo this look I've done
quite wind we're going to do that now
we'll go in to the crease and I'm going
to use the color
truffled wrap with my rose smells so
good this color here in this pile if you
don't have at this palette
smells a chocolate a genuine
smells like chocolate pretty nice much
can you use that shade truffled and the
crease blend no that brush had black on
it crap I'm going to use my fluffy brush
to blend out again and I think the key
is do these shadows are actually really
pigmented it's surprising I was really
surprised I hope good through it'll be
not in a bad way I just thought because
there are support peeler and really
quite for the popular with younger girls
I just get into makeup cause of the cute
packaging and then expect such good
quality but honestly they're so good so
I'm just going back into the translation
sheet just to both I over try to anyway
now I'm going to go and wear a little
tiny morphe brush this is they aim at 5
or 7 love it and when you use the
truffle jig which is a darker Brown and
I'm going to drag that right along
underneath my eye get that nice and dark
and then I'm going to use the same
little brush just to pack on the Pegman
on the top I think see the kind of
makeup I do is not it's not very
technically it's not really blended it's
not supposed to run eat or tidy so I can
kind of get away with being a little bit
quicker or not but Maisie with it and
then I'm going to take it off at the end
which that's gonna stay like I like to
do my makeup and I'm going to drag down
the brain sheet just a little bit here
because I'm actually going to use a wipe
just to kind of sharpen the edge up so I
like the pigments come quite far down
and then the waif will just going to
clean all that up I'm going to go back
and risk that a little more flush and
we're going with the Tschida licorice
I'm not going to show you what the
caller knows because it's just black so
I'm going to use that and I'm going to
pack on and the coroner and underneath
just a little basil and that's just -
can I get the depth up in it nice and
smoky we're going with my favorite
little sugar pill brush and just do a
little bit blend and know just kind of
tackle on the sides of the black to kind
of blend into the brown now I'm going to
go in with the she born bone which is
this color here it's got a slight
shimmer to it but because it's such a
nice warm pinna
coffee it'll help me blend so I'm gonna
go in with a shade
on my sugar pill brush and I'm just
going to go along the sides of the brown
on the top of the brow I think it's
quite good because the pigments actually
not as good at these shades but I think
that's a good thing that only went a
little bit just to help me blend I don't
want it to be pure pink you know now I'm
going to go in where the little looks
luxe classic shader brush this is the
rose gold in deliever brushes and I
wouldn't work with the same machine
what do one with the shaved coconut
cream which is the lightest shade in the
palette and I'm just gonna put a little
base on my lid and inner corner as well
and then I'm gonna give that a little
blend oh now we're going with another
true face product that is the shadow
insurance glitter glue this is one of my
favorite all-time products especially if
you ever I like working with pigments or
glitters anything like that that you
maybe think something like the pigment
looks amazing in the box but when you go
to put on your eye kind of falls apart
see if you put this base on underneath
and the blue just helps everything stick
so I'm just applying that with my finger
all over we have put the lighter color
if you don't have nails like me this is
pretty easy if you have nails like me
good luck because that's that's tricky
the color I'm going to go on my phone
the word is Anglo pigment this is number
85 and it's been compared to my blue
brown quite a lot of tightness but I
actually like a lot better and I nearly
just text it in my drawer that we've
been here so I'm just going to go in
with that pick up a little bit of Ekman
and pop on top of the glitter
you'll notice that and I'm not on my
foundation yet sometimes I did a my
foundation first for these clear
tutorials like eye makeup tutorials but
because this one's working with so many
pigments I can see all this fall I
imagine I'd had my foundation on already
what time a I would have need sliding
through this tutorial is great so I'm
just using a winged liner brush and I'm
just getting a little bit of this gel
liner so this is just the end gloss gel
liner in pretty well known for being
super black and really started Israel so
it's good for going on top all I make it
we've done a pigment so I'm just going
to do that and I'm only going to bring
my later today corner of the eye
and then I'm going to use the gel liner
as well to go in my waterline I see if
you wiggle your brush in between your
lashes it makes it look super dark
recent much darker so I'm just using a
reboot swipe I usually I keep these
handy in case I just want to quickly
remove my makeup before cleanse in or if
it on the go their goods and I'm just
going to get the white and put it on my
finger like so and I'm just going to
sweep that up here's hoping this works
out so much smoke Oh a little bit more
underneath though I'm just using the
color peanut butter again which is the
darker brain just to get that nice and
dark underneath first then we run with a
wave again
we don't like that just snow because we
can always win with a blending brush
whisking some concealer and just gonna
like buff up a little bit
next I'm going to place I'm going to
pick up my little brush again and they
want to use to put the pigment on and
when I use the end of this brush with a
little bit of the glitter glue the turf
is Claira glue and when it poor pet I'm
a tenor coroner just takes off and then
I got something really exciting today I
go out the new makeup geek in sparkly
pigments so this is stargazer so these
are like new loose clothes from makeup
geek they've just brought the maid in
recently I've only started seeing stuff
online about them recently as well so
I'm going to go in with the same brush I
use for the pigment and we're going to
pop that inner corner beautiful I can't
wait to go and have a look at other
colors and then I'm going to go a little
bit darker just underneath this lash
line and a little bit darker in the
crease as well so I'm going to use the
black to smoke out that later for sure
take my mascara and lashes so the lashes
I'm using are L daughter I think these
are I'll do it once or amodal sevens and
mascara I'm going to use is nabla the
film noir and a flower the Italian
drives I use quite often it's got some
kickass eye shadows which they actually
and I'm gonna use oh honey miel I'm
gonna use just the end of the brush just
a wiggle underneath important lashes
like this just to get that volume and
then I wait for my lash to dry basically
well then wait for my last drink make
sure you have a kind of butter a lot bit
more just make it not so harsh line in
Avenue saying that they in effect of
these paste underneath my eyes because
it is very peachy it's almost like a
peach concealer and its really good for
under eyes so I've been using that I get
it's quite a tacky products you'll need
a little tiny bit and I just cannot step
all right along and then lot will say to
side movements with the gel fiber brush
when you get to the eye shadow you can
just kind of like tackle the concealer
enter those idle and
girls bus out a little bit not so I used
to do makeup with my car's value so if
you've watched any about all tutorials
you'll see me using tape and I still do
really like that Luke but recently I
just like it a little bit more blue now
a little bit more smoky I think when
it's a really harsh street lighting it's
really easy to make them and if they're
ever not super super cool then it looks
a bit silly so this is a easier way to
do it okay but I'm right for that last
to dry so I'm going to go in with a
little bit of a car opal highlighter
which is mono complete favourite and
when you go in with the same brush
reviews for all my pigments today the
zoeva brush I'm going to just highlight
my Play Rayborn sometimes you're highly
just kind of helps blend everything
together as well so now I've put my eye
Sean I'm just going to go over the last
piece in bit the lash with my trusty
super we know the perfect slug L'Oreal
black one and I'm just going to color
and wear my lash nice the fall see and
it just makes it look a little bit more
realistic which is obviously the endgame
here and I'm going to shoot off into my
foundation and I'll be back with a
finished look I hope you guys like the
finished look I'll definitely rocking
something like this for a new year
something it's super super dark and
grungy back-to-back two pallets that's
thank you guys so much for watching and
I hope you have an amazing Christmas at
New Year bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
