we are going to do this grungy but
glittery smokey eye and it's something
that I do myself quite a lot it's really
popular at the moment with clients as
well so it's just them I know it's kind
of fun makeup to do that is suitable for
dating or evening depending what kind of
person you are if you would like to see
how I created this look please stay
tuned
so I've obviously done that I already I
did it a long time ago because my camera
would not charge and so the first thing
I'm going to do is I have already
prepared my eyeball with lien law pimp
up by Mac and I just used a water mercy
powder to say it over my eye I'm going
to use my Mac two to four brush and this
color here and we're just going to set
my eye so I'm going to use that color
all over so pretty easy and I'll leave
the kind of below just left with
concealer now I'm going to use the color
of smarty pants which is here and the
palette I'm using is obviously the
tartlet in bloom which is one of my
all-time favorites and we use that in
the crease using its own side motions of
those brushes honestly one of my
favorites I don't use that many Mac
products I just love this brush it's
just one of my favorite blending brushes
if I had to recommend two brushes that I
think everyone needs to buy it's the
micro tavor and the sleeve are two to
four which is so funny because it's the
same number I recommend that those
brushes to pretty much everybody and
I'll be using this we voted for Annabeth
so these colors in this palette pigments
are really really good pregnant is
really good in these eyeshadows and I'm
just using bit by bit one more eye
shadow just building up that color
mostly in the crease bringing it quite
high up to the brow because I like my
eyes feet big and blow notes smokey like
that no once I've got my
a shade on I'm going to swap my brush to
the beloved is Weaver 2 to 4 and I'm
really more in where the color rainbow
which is just here and I really need to
kind of pull me to one and I'm going to
use that in the crease so I'm going to
put a brush kind of slightly higher and
just packing that color on in the crease
and then we need to blend I just go back
to my Mac 2 to 4 and I just blend the
sides of that color just to help bother
I every commit already
because the skin is paid out it will
just kind of brush away and otherwise
you can just do your skin after you've
done your eye makeup go a number that
color rebel and we got underneath my eye
just using the two tooth working almost
on its side that helps blend and I've
used the same paint pot underneath my
eye as well to help if the eyeshadow
stick I'm going to go back in with the
color smarty-pants
which is the transition shade and I'm
just going to help blend that underneath
my eye and above
now I'm going with the same two to four
brush C or pin rascal
and when one with a color here which is
called the leader and it's just a really
nice dark Bailey color I'm going to go
in the crease and then I'm kind of
buffing that onto the lid here as well
and then underneath mine too
and then I'm going to use the vichy for
the outside of my eye and I'm just going
to concentrate on that and then what
needs a bigger brush just to blend those
two just like that now I'm going to use
a little shade a little bit of their
activist color which is here which is
the probably darkest color in the
palette and I'm going to use that
underneath my eye and then just in the
outer corner as well just like that
if you ever worry about your blend in
what you can do is you burn with the
warm color light rebel there and just
use that just to help blend and you can
a warm color is going to help that they
can ask your darker tones blend a bit so
now we put that pallet down and we're
going to use one of the new Tarte metal
eyeshadows this is the color hussy and
these are just super pigmented metallic
eyeshadows or Julia so names like the
Tate's showed the formula Lisa's phone
so we're going to use that with a weaver
two three four brush which is just like
a maze pack like I kind of nice eyes
shadow brush the one that you'll bought
when you were 12 this is the only brush
I used to have I'm going to pack that
one mail it I love these and obviously
I've still got them in their single Pat
they're a little single eyeshadow
packaging but you can deport these
really easily and put them in a Z
palette which I'm planning on doing
we're just the excess off that brush and
then I'm going to go in with a shade
from your gutter which is just here in
sort of the nice shimmer going to put
that in inner corner and now I'm
actually going to go in with a little
bit of this
activist which is the darkest color
again I'm going to put a little bit of
that in the crease now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take the next glitter
primer and this is just a really nice
way to apply glitter it's not too sticky
like when I used to use eyelash glue
that was pretty special to get off and
I'm just going to apply that with my
little flat brush that I used for the
shimmer I'm going to pop that just on
top of where the shemitahs being careful
not to put too much 100 when that's on
I'm going to use the Le splash and these
are their new little crystallized
glitters and the shades really nice it's
the two Queenie
tequila okay cool any say tequila take
care of tequila tequila Laney tick tick
aleni who knows man it's cool
and I'm going to use just a wee a shadow
brush that's kind of fluffy right just
apply that on top of the clutter as it
glares on I'm going to use my Kat Von D
tripper liner and fever eyeliner of all
time not gonna lie and I'm just going to
do a nice line just the end of my ight
just likes to know the lashes I'm using
no I'm really embarrassed about these I
don't even feel like showing you them
but I've wore these a lot of times these
are the Lily lashes and Michael knows
the Greek place I don't know and there
is really nice my crush as I have
honestly had these on my eyes 10-15
times already
so that's find out a little bit grubby
but they do last ages and you can get
them from Lily lashes ourselves or
there's a town called designer lashes UK
that Salem and the UK which is obviously
easier for us now just applied the glue
I use the dual brush or glue and it's
not easy to get here you have to get on
Amazon but it is my favorite blue Lee
takes free and it dries really quickly
Israel so I just pop that on the lash
then I'm going to use my Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara as the base
mascara is so good and I'm just going to
use that for my lashes now when you're
putting mascara on aim and your plan on
using lashes just remember that you
don't need too many courts because
obviously if your lashes are super thick
and then you can see for the full flash
start it kind of ruins their fate so I
just do one coat and then I put a little
bit chunkier on my bottom lashes I'm
actually going to go in with the morphe
in 5:07 brush it's just so small it is
the perfect little brush for going in
your crease so I'm going to use a little
bit of the darkest shade again and I'm
just going to darken that whole era
corner up well my lashes drain
I love this parlor more than life okay
my lashes ready there's a drug Buy here
on it if anyone else has a dog you'll
know my pain of walking through the
whole day feeling that you're being
stabbed in the eye even really it's just
like a dog here chillin and between your
eyeball and your eyelash and then I'm
just applying this light I've cut it
quite short because I just want to set
up those side so I'm just gonna pipe in
the outside towards the inside and then
when trying lashes on what you can do
test the I've been used already you can
just go over the band with your liner
just make sure it's nice and black and
then no one can tell you've had your
eyelashes on ten times now I'm actually
going to use a tiny little bit of the
tar metallic eyeshadow and just bring
that onto the legs a little bit more in
the middle and this is the finished look
now bind this to phone so guys the
finished look I hope you liked this
tutorial
super crack sip it easy see there's a
butane but genuinely this does it
doesn't take too long and it is nice and
dry see it's nice and dry 'fuck enough
for an eight-time or juice tea as it is
today
and I'm doing nothing so I'm just gonna
chill around my house walk the dog
cetera yeah and it's also a nice thing
to do if you're really bad at here like
me your hears about dirty needs wash and
use put it up in a little bun you're
still gone before your eyes on to its
