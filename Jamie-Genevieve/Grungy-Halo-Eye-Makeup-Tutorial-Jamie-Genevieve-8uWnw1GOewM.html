week what we're going to do is something
that is good for you people that are
gone out for Halloween but you're not
waiting to j-stop so you're wanting
something quite grungy quite smoky a wee
bit more than maybe usually do but it's
also suitable for people like me like
your trust mistakes or just amazing role
or to go to the garden center which is
what I'm going to do today with this new
Caban so yeah and I'm gonna be very
saying they're new makeup geek shadows
and they brought I like 20 new matte
colors and I'm so good they're amazing
they're so beautiful and I love that
they're old mat as well so they've got
some they can have mil will needed
colours in there like a really green
deep blue deep brown you've got more
purples and things like that quite a lot
of new proposed and you've got Glee's
which is good because everyone has a
gray smoke so I'm going to be using
these to create this look and I'm also
going to be using a lot of makeup geek
pigment as well that I've had for a
while and I've not used before so I
think this is kind of like a really
grungy spotlight / halo
I am I really hope you guys like it if
you'd like to see how I created it stay
tuned as always soft ochre boarding
morning usual drell all over the light
I'm going to go in with the shade
pencil-pusher and I'm just going to use
my my brush it from sugarpill
and we're just gonna place this either
side of that
in our corners well I can't even explain
to you how much I love these eyeshadows
I mean I know I love makeup be called
anything but I honestly find that these
are the shades that they were missing
being in mind that this is quite a
grungy look like I'm not all about
getting this looking perfect by a big
black eye
bringing up quick hi it's ro
and we're just gonna kind of connect
that a little bit not too much there's a
spot like a cool now I'm going to go in
with she tomato kind of which is like a
really dark plum e Brown ever going to
put that just intensify the inner corner
that would definitely if you have the
toys do this before you do your
foundation because it is pretty messy
especially because going to use that
Goldy pigment soon I pay to take my skin
so she don't come off not bad once you
kind of pack that on I just go back into
your layer color and cannot bully and I
I'm just going to use that right
underneath here either side of I and
we're gonna shade Mirage which is just a
really cute cream color and we're gonna
put that and the same are basically
where we're gonna be put in or a glare
if you're one that Matt is Botley eye or
halo eye whatever you want to call it
and you could just leave it at this
stage with the the cream you see it's
quite a lot layers well but it's nice so
I'm going to go back and with my bare
smooth brush this is the brush that I
used two two four seven and it's what I
used to kind of build up the coroner and
inside I'm just gonna go over the crease
and blend out west last look you're
kinda like one between your brushes a
lot and win a build up and we look back
and I was a darker color
I'm in Carroll I'm just gonna build up
if they were a corner a bit more
Flynn Flynn Flynn Flynn anything as your
friend and I'm just gonna go in with a
black eyeshadow so I have actually ran
out of money cupcake 1 but is by far my
favorite black and that was called
corrupt I'm just using one every pilot
just now and I'm just intensifying both
the corners a little bit more if this
happens to you then you're screwed
already done your friend a shine and do
not ever even try and okay just blend
away I'm using like my little concealer
brush I'm just gonna go in with a
foundation brush just going back in with
a little bit more American or just kind
of build it up I'm gonna need a and I
think no it's super pigment this is my
favorite thing in the world this is the
Too Faced glitter glue and I just put a
teeny little bit the back of my hands
and then I don't have any needles at the
moment so I'm gonna use my finger to
pick up some the product and I'm just
gonna dab that on my spotlight and then
I'm gonna go in with the pikmin you took
the end from makeup geek and which is
just the most gorgeous thought if you
can see it through there and was
gorgeous Kenna Goldie shovin II but it's
quite dark it's quite a grungy color and
I'm just going to use one of my little
Smurfs brushes to pick up that product
Irish pop on I know a lot of people that
don't use a glitter glue to put stuff
like that's all I am I personally prefer
it because it lasts so much longer and
the payoff is like going it's too nice
and we're just kind of you just kind of
smudged it so you to that and then we're
going to do the exact same thing
underneath a little bit of a glitter
glue
if you have adjacent Neil's like I
usually do then you can just use a brush
to apply and got a clue I'm just going
to use my trusty little gosh eyeliner
pen which is actually nearly done so the
good thing about these is how easy they
are to use the bad thing is is they run
out really quick and if you're going to
go on top or something with pigment and
glue it does kind of bug it up a little
bit but that's fine so we're just going
to do a nice Lane
I'm just going to use the night fly
magic pencil and do great in the middle
of the spotlight and then I'm going to
use the other nafla pencil I've got the
black veils at Lane pencil just to do it
either side and I'm just gonna add a
little bit more kale light to the eye
after you then I pick but it's always
nice to corner go back over the brush
just to be sure that there's nothing
settling in the crease and let's do
mascara so top lashes obviously and then
bottom lashes I'm going to just go right
over a lot of marshes that some people
will leave the little metal section to
make it more dramatic but I'm going with
gardens and earlier and I don't really
feel like being a drag queen pop your V
Lynaugh Sean and if you're like me and
you use your lashes a few times you can
just use your eyeliner to go over the
base of the lash the root of the lash
and that just makes it super dark again
I've wore these last shades a few things
so today will be the last deal we are
them so I'm gonna just get some mascara
and can I join my life to the fake
lashes give me the extra volume and
blackness and that's the finished look
so it's just a super crunchy night a
suitable for sure I makeup and I hope
you guys like this video and I'll be
back next week with an hour Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
