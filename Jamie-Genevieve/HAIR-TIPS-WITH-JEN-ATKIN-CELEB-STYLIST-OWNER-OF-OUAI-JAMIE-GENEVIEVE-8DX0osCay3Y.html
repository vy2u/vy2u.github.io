then yeah this is you I'm your guest
okay yeah you're in my home but I'm here
again hi guys welcome back to my channel
today I am Walter Lewin I am joined by
Janet Ken the hero here one of the loves
of my life though ah yeah I don't know
if I was gonna admit that to you but we
have Jane it's gonna help me sort my
hand out this is my here I actually have
your tape ends in as well are you
wearing really like such a good I'm like
a brand right with my leg you're a good
walking billboard that's good hair
thanks fading right not the color I just
got my hair sandwiched between two of
your teeth I did look great though they
look such a perfect length you used to
do not good at doing your own hair but
like you have like just really cool real
hair like you are doing come on here I
would teach you like something that you
don't normally do okay okay like how do
you work in here most of the time either
it gets fails for me by my hair choice I
spoiled up I am spoiled
I make time once a week I go and see
Jack he sorts my hero and then I just
make it last the week
oh my god that's so funny yeah so you
get a blowout and it lost you a full
week yeah so you're like the dry shampoo
Queen yes wife Joyce your thumb yes I
have I remember I am you told me to are
dry shampoo plum you gotta really like
worked it out and yeah that's all the
way dry and it's like life-changing yes
is it so good yes I am I'm a very lazy
person with my hair that's one of my
questions for you is how often should
someone wash their hair it totally
depends I feel like I don't want to tell
everybody to wash them all the time
because who has the time for it yeah I
am NOT person that gets so annoyed and
happen to dry my hair I like to try to
space it out three days usually if I'm
in like a sleek bun that guy was
yesterday I haven't washed it for like
four days yes but I always tell people
like if you have a really oily scalp
like our supplements really great I
didn't like fight that I think if we're
really oily scalp and they dry ends you
should wash with two different shampoos
so wash the roots with something
volumizing and cleansing
really get it clean but I didn't watch
the ends that are publicly colored or
damaged or long and just dry wash that
with something hydrating like repair or
smooth shampoo and then it balances it
out so you can wear your hair an extra
day so you that because and you're gonna
go two weeks without washing your hair
most to much isn't that people a little
much people don't working with me so you
know maybe wear your hair wavy yes I
kind of just pull a texture yeah okay
I'm gonna show you how to straighten it
and I'm gonna tell you that memory mess
okay look at it okay why don't we just
have some fun okay okay Jamie you're the
first to see this dry texture foam it's
out in the States it's going to be here
things basic-cable have it in June so
basically dry texture foam with all the
rage and everyone loves it to get volume
up with the roots to clean your hair so
you don't have to wash it but dry
texture bomb is now got product for like
mid length to ends okay and you
basically just like go for it you put it
under oath with the foam party for real
literally you want to just get it from
middling to end and what its gonna do is
it's gonna give you that like really
cool Pinterest hair and you want to just
make sure that you keep rubbing it until
it dries it's so good for extensions
because you know an extension start to
get that kind of like fluff or you can
tell that it's extensions yep it's great
because it just kind of helps give it
that really cool oil PC texture but it's
so great you guys to get kind of that
cool width that you need and it's almost
all the way dry your hair loves this
really yeah it's been really good on
your hair so that's what you do and you
basically just keep rubbing it until
it's dry sometimes I'll take my finger
and just make them alike separate
exactly huge that's issues but look at
the difference between like how crazy is
that she's cooler than her it's insane
she's a little bit cooler this girl is
cooler and like makes her friends
jealous good but that's just what
texture foam does so I wanted to show
you that before we go into like this
amazing movie we'll get out in June June
birthday month every month you didn't
you just for my birthday
happy birthday you know what I'm gonna
give you this can to keep you get it
before anybody else here alright you
could sell on eBay myself can you sign
it
and I want to show you memory miss as
this is here in the UK and I feel like
some people have questions about memory
myths and what it is and what it does
although the early girls want to be
straight the straight hair girls want
curls and they can't like hold a curl
yep so it's so incredible because not
only is it a heat protectant I just
learned this it protects up to 450
degrees Fahrenheit and 270 degrees
Celsius perfect yeah I feel really proud
that I remember that yeah nope you
basically want to spray it in your hair
before you use your hot tools because
it's going to be a heat protectant but
it's gonna memorize the style you're
doing with the Tong does that make sense
yes so it doesn't eautiful yes so if you
read Tong it'll hold the curl for like
days if you use a flat iron it will keep
it super straight and sleek for days I
feel like I see you use this old became
obsessed you love it it's so is what you
think a lot of people wonder if it's
worth that in here you should be so bad
I know I'm Lauren today in the UK
I've got the Hoover firm I don't care
hahaha well don't use it on your head no
no Jackson has a blow dryer so this is
my trick that I do because I think we
have this weird obsession with like
drying our hair straight using a Tong
then flat ironing through the curls yeah
so it's like effortless and cool so this
is the way I do my hair every day and it
worked so well okay really
I'm gonna take the one half and you have
to do the other half okay okay this
isn't fair if I do your whole hair so
this is basically a way to get a really
nice Bend and I'm just gonna show you in
one section okay but I use our way wave
spray I'll show you guys good such a
good really good then we got way way
spray like it has no salt in it so it's
never gonna get cheeky it's basically
like gives you that hair that when
you're on vacation and your hair drives
just perfectly
spray some waves spray and then I'm
gonna take the Dyson supersonic with the
diffuser and I have it at medium
temperature and medium airflow okay and
so on my own Regulus I take my hair I
leave the very end out and I just kind
of start to bend it back and forth kind
of like all let's lunch
yep I squeeze it and I place it into the
diffuser really like gently I'm not
squeezing it I'm just holding it down
with my fingers and the way that the
diffuser is actually designed by them
ears it mimics the curl the unnatural
fold up so you can look at your young
and like on what hair this separate
would wave spray you can use volume
spray the root if you want but it gives
you two wait how crazy that it gives you
like a white cat will you because you
wait but I'm gonna have you do the next
time don't be scared no one's gonna see
this it's fine don't worry are going to
see you okay ready I'm gonna prep you
okay by the way string can go on damp or
dry hair I'm gonna practice by any words
info or I'm gonna give you this one are
you right-handed yes yes okay you're
gonna take it from the bottom here right
and leave a little bit at the end up you
know just right and now start folding
back and forth just like an accordion I
think back and forth you fold it you got
it you got it
that's right and keep going one more
time one more time one more time and you
just gently put it in the diffuser I
have it on medium
and you don't even need to like hold it
that long I notice I'm not I know you're
not going it down I'm letting it just
kind of like dry the way it would
naturally yeah give it like I say 10 to
20 seconds I love hair tutorials I love
watching people do here because I can
really learn some of those ones you know
you have to go to our website we have so
many
and we also have like a hair quiz okay
you can take for a basic reasons like to
fill it out and it tells you which
products are right there you know you
can just get it online like just give
you a really cool Bend looks like an
effortless Bend all right you have to do
what okay well well let me prep you
you're gonna do great I have a the new
wave spray we've screamin for it here's
your piece and the way to you did it was
like this yep you got it and like I'm
really excited see if I manage to do
that I know you're gonna be such a phony
start to feel when I gets dries I'm
gonna have to be all the way dry by the
way like I let it go if 80% dry and
design its own you did it you're done so
now we got to talk about straighten
sighs okay I really want to teach you
how to do this yes again a memory mist
is gonna help you guys to protect your
hair from the heat but it's also gonna
give it this like amazing it's like a
coat of just like protection but it also
makes it like a silky gorgeous okay so
let me just show you I'm gonna do one
side and you do the other okay yes your
hair sighs it's gonna get so mad at me
cuz I'm gonna teach you how to do your
own hair nice so I'm using a boar
bristle brush to kind of brush through
your hair I'm taking and every mess and
I'm basically gonna just go for it and
spray it all over undried hair and then
I like to just basically take the boar
bristle brush and I follow the brush
with the fat I'm gonna have a GHD here
really kind of like follow the brush as
I go down and you just really like go
all the way down and kind of brush
through that gorgeous and like amazing
of this you're gonna really good with
silky straight hair I'm excited I'm
excited
you know why silky straight hair it
makes your face pop I think in a really
good way like especially if you're gonna
do
no but you are feel like silky straight
hair is so great especially when you're
taking photos - because straight hair
that's healthy and glossy will reflect
light yep you just look so put together
you can take a round brush if you don't
have a flat pedal like Mason Pearson and
get the same look look how pretty that
is touch it like that's touchable hair
when I straighten my hair it doesn't
feel like that are you taking like small
sections are you just like taking you
can't get too lazy with it you find use
memory miss I'm telling you it's like
game changer so memory mess all over the
hair before you do it brush through it
so I'm showing you guys now this is just
like a regular round brush and I'm sure
everyone has at their house and you're
gonna follow along the brush with the
Flatiron and the reason why you want to
do a boar bristle brush you guys is it
will help distribute the oil from your
scalp to the ends and it also gets
really good tension when you're doing a
straight look and it just gives you the
tension that you need look at that girl
you are so amazing hair great section
did you hear usually get this okay when
you do it yourself when I get it done
somewhere so it was nice but I did
myself no notice that like I'm really
giving good tension when I'm doing it
yep and I'm really like pushing and like
giving it a minute to get all the way
down and you don't have to be scared you
guys to keep the heat on there cuz again
the memory mess is a heat protectant
it's gonna protect your hair from any
heat damage look how pretty that is like
that just like glistens you look so chic
and I'm gonna go and kind of grab at the
hair and just follow the brush memory
mist makes it any time I do something
for a red carpet it's gonna be like
straight and sleep mm-hmm I always prep
it with memory mess because it really
just smoothes it so perfectly I'm
already almost done with this section so
it's your turn in a second if you had to
pick three products that you're favorite
favorite what would they be I would say
waste free because every single girls
obsessed with it yeah supplements I
don't have any on me literally everybody
still my supplements what one the
cemetery I take thin so I had bangs and
I fringe yeah I had friends probably I
cut it like I'd say it's been about a
month and a half and I was like over it
so I started taking our thin supplements
just to kind of promote it to get longer
really quickly so I can like tuck it
away and I cut my bangs down yeah so if
you get a bad haircut they're so amazing
and also I feel like women's hormones
change so much so it's good to like take
internal stuff to kind of help yeah I'll
tell that out and then I take my other
favorite product my god it's so hard
it's hard when you try foam is amazing
direction of the song yeah like a game
changer
yeah because it works for everyone again
and then I'd say the treatment mask the
treatment mask is still great especially
here super damaged I think that's the
only thing that I've actually not try
from you the treatment mask no but I
think you'll be obsessed the rules here
and pour the oil okay I go through my
photos and bottles of this it has no
silicone in it at all so it's literally
like you can meet glossy from head to
toe and yes I see one of your stylists
for me Alex used this to get me a wet
look here oh my gosh she used I don't
remember she'd sailed on my hair and
she's a bit 20 pump who did you again as
a Catholic I clean up she's so great
yeah yeah yeah belly ounces but she was
putting all this oil and I was like oh

up we can do this I'm gonna give you so
much money parts so when you walk around

things are gonna go wrong no no no
you're gonna do great just like first of
all you just have an intention here you
go just like yeah I'm going to do cut it
away when we messed ray it all over the
whole section route tab is this a sake
shade yeah I would say typical you would
in a curling iron and take clean
sections so you don't get frustrated
okay okay okay so now which brush do you
want

flat brush really yeah I think I'm gonna
brush it and then you want to kind of

old interviews I am fully saying that I
don't believe them you say that we're
going and then once everyone started
requesting it when we were talking to
our customers
I was like wait what's the deal with
heat protectant and then our product
development team literally like gave me
the facts and they're like you really
can't protect your hair today I'm gay

thing before we keep going because I'm
so crazy about a perfect part we stole
