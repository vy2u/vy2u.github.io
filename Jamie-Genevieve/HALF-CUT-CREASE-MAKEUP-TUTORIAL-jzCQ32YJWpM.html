I'm going to show you how to do a little
half cut crease cockatrices
are not the easiest thing over LC I see
it when I'm doing the tutorial I don't
practice this on this eye before I did
decide to show you guys it's one of
those things it's so stunning
it's a really kind of it's a suppressed
if I see someone and they've got a good
cut crease I'm like down they'll done
built a muffin because I don't know who
that how hard it can be before we get
into this tutorial please subscribe to
my channel and if you do like this I do
remember and give it a little cheeky
thumbs up for your friend Jamie over
here filming at 9 o'clock at night for
you so as you guys would like to see how
I created this I lichbane station let's
do this
I've clearly done one eye already the
reason for that being I don't got a cut
crease very long time so I can I want to
practice first and then when I finished
this eye I asked you guys on Twitter if
you'd like a tutorial and you'll say yes
so thanks for that I've already done the
rest of my makeup and I have prepared my
led with laying low pimp up by Mac you
know you guys know the palette I'm going
to use today as the modern renaissance
palette honest opinions on this palette
so far stunning so so lovely although I
feel like it is quite a dusty shadow I
feel like when I use my brush a lot of
dust gets kicked up and I know that a
few of my friends who I used to work
with they had it before me and they hit
the pan really quickly lead to makeup on
a lot of people so they had the pan
really quickly which I'm about in about
but I think it definitely is worth
picking up if you're a makeup fine first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
in with color temperature and the Mac
two to four as always and I'm just going
to pop that over this brush is
dirty I'm going to put that on all over
my lid I'm not too bothered about the
dirty brush I think I've come to terms
with that by then once that primer has
set and label and with B color raw
Sierra raw Sienna just here and I'm
going to start building up my crease so
we'll just place in the brush and my
crease and in backwards and forwards
motions obviously with
the payment already dates or the product
is goes on really smoothly Anastasi is a
pigment and that eyeshadow is insane
it's so good glitching means it just
make sure that you're only going on with
a little bit at a time I'm just using it
backwards and forwards motions with my
branch angled slightly up the way and
that just means that when I'm blending
the sides of the brush can I help blend
up towards my brows there's no harsh
lines and then if you can see on this
eye I bring the color quite far end
because we want that cut crease to be
really defined and if you're cutting a
crease and there's not much shadow
you're not much pigment it can end up
looking like a little bit wishy-washy as
we would see in bold Scotland once
that's on I'm going to go in with this
shade bright orange which is just next
to it it's also like a cane out
transition shade but it's just a little
bit warmer so I'm just going to pack
that on on top now that that's on it the
reason that this one looks really ready
and quite dark is because I've packed
one tons of the red ochre color it is so
beautiful the color and the palette is
stunning and just like other shades it's
super pigmented so just a little bit at
a time same brush we're just going to
start building that up in the crease as
well and then when I feel like I've got
too much pigment on my brush I usually
just do this backwards and forward on my
knuckles and that just means that it
gets rid of the connect excess pigment
got some cheese we should have some
cheese and that is how you start it is
in 17-3 you want some sure no thanks you
can't no stop into Dawa you're talking
to a dog okay I'm just going to do this
again and I'm going to use the side of
the brush just to kind of drag that
pigment a little bit you learn to
something you don't already know right
do this who would like to see dry kinda
my makeup that is a question let it was
nothing below other Bella review yeah I
know that you think that I know that you
think that and you're going to see
sarong I'll give information she's you
know I'm just bringing that regular
color right into the inner corner
and now I'm going to get that riddle for
color and I'm just going to start
packing that on on the outer corner of
my let's just just have it here so not
too much but usually when I'm doing
looks like this I keep the whole edge
free so in this case I'm just going to
bring it slightly onto the outer corner
now I'm going to change my brush tool is
Weaver two to four super exciting and
I'm going to go in with the red or
crocheted again but I'm going to mix it
in with the shade here at Cypress Umbra
and I'm just going to start focusing
that on our corner first and then I'm
going to mix those two same colors and
start packing that on underneath my eye
mostly the red color and then I'm going
to change my brush to the tooth fairy
rice Smith and I'm going to use that for
an orange color the transition
underneath to help blend that out I'm
going to go in with the darkest color in
the palette Cyprus Umbra and I'm going
to put that in the crease now just using
my tutu for it from deliver all the
brushes that are like my favorites and
that I use a lot I always link them
underneath every video and just so you
guys can see but I've listed like all my
favorite brushes down there and then I'm
just going back home with a tutu for it
and helping to blend those if you get
fall out like here because I've already
coated my undereyes I've done my
highlight I can just cannot wait that
away so up until now it just kind of
looks like a nice smokey eye this is
beautiful by itself you don't need to
cut the crease if you feel like that's
too dramatic but if you are obviously
cutting the crease and there's makeup as
be hardest bet hence why I had to
practice before I did it make sure I
could still do it as one of those looks
it does take a little bit longer to do
so if you this is like an amazing look
for a cameo for sure and an Asian gray
felt cut crease is so popular so it's a
really great thing as a makeup artist to
be able to do but the more you practice
on different eye shapes and stuff they
cannot easily get I'm happy with mesh I
look up till now so I'm going to cut the
crease the way that I'm going to do that
which I find by far is the easiest is
I'm going to use concealer and this
brush is super important X's Weaver two
to six smudger brush but if you look at
really nice and rounded which means you
can use the shape of the brush that can
I help get your new street lanes the
concealer I'm going to use is the turret
shape tape
it's the concealer that I use under my
eyes quite a lot it is such a favorite
among youtubers and I just love it I
think it's an amazing concealer so I'm
going to get that in the back of my hand
so I'm going to get this on the back of
my brush not too much but I want a clean
nice and creamy so you don't want to
work too slowly otherwise it meat start
to sit and I have my cut crease going at
rate from inner corner to get out
halfway across my lid so I'm going to
start doing that also I cut crease I
like to go it slightly above my own
crease not only does that make my eyes
look bigger but it also stops it from
creasing as much
once that's done I'm going to end with
the later shade in the palette tempura
I'm going to use this Weaver to 3-1 it's
just a nice density crease brush is
called and I'm going to start to say at
that concealer you need to use quite a
lot for those here now I'm going to go
in with the next 14 brush if you can see
it's like I've super dense brush and I
only really use it for doing things like
this and I'm gonna just neat it up the
crease the line where the crease stops
and I'm just going to make sure that
it's really matte right next to the
Coakley's something else you can do is
well just make sure it's super neat is
going with a shade like red ochre and
I'm just going to use that same really
dense brush and I'm going to just go
along the line for your the creases of
meat now we're going to start to blend
this part here that really door Julie
convert I'm going to go in with the to
transition shades first just these two
here mixed together and I'm just going
to start patting that on and using
backwards and forwards motions and
between the concealer at nozzle to start
getting that blend and you can see that
it just blends really easily because
we've mattify the concealer at that step
is really important and I'm going to go
in with a little bit of red ochre again
and just kind of blend over that again
again again again once that is done you
can go ahead and apply your shower so
I'm going to be using two different
letters and eat glitter primer that is
my favorite one it's from next and it
should called your gutter primer and the
way that I apply that as I get on the
back of my hand and now I'm going to use
Urban Decay dog concealer brush this is
quite a fluffy concealer brush so it's
great for applying this primer just so
it doesn't go on the cupping bulb you
can cane up further on I'm just going to
doing that all over the cut crease part
but also a little bit into the middle
now I'm going to go back in with the 2/3
one brush it's quite
- fluffy brush but it's still fluffy and
I'm going to use my Mac reflect gold
glitter this is one of my favorite
glitters but I think it's quite hard to
get no I will try and find the link for
you guys but I don't know if it's
discontinued I use get more glare who
thought I'd ever see that and then you
can just kind of dust it away if it gets
on any eyeshadow and then now I'm going
to use this is a little bit funky there
actually if it's not really I'm going to
use my alias flash glitter and pina
colada and it's just a really beautiful
can I sell really white glitter it's
quite chunky those I don't want to use
that Street or I like a kind of thinner
glitter and I'm going to apply that
using the brush that already has a
little bit primer on it so when I just
go in here
the glitter specs to the brush Pat that
on more so just the inner connect or
inner part I don't want too much of this
stuff and again cause our skins Matt you
can just kind of dust away any for now
I'm going to apply mascara my favorite
corn ball or mascara at the moment is
the man-eater mascara by Tarte and then
just top pull of the mag lash mascara up
from the balm this way I get super full
thick lashes with no kind of crumbling
nothing kind of moves you in the D and
the mitem it's the only thing that makes
my bottom lashes look warm
and now I'm going to apply it leave my
black mascara
see from me I'd never get lashes like
this without like false lashes so I'm
quite buzzing about this little corn
boys manage to feed the lack of money
use our lovely lashes I cannot remember
the name for the laser meat so I will
link it down below a photo member I have
good news
all right going email from Beauty be
just one of their PR emails that is
saying to all their customers and I saw
that they are no stalking Lily lashes so
it's much easier for all mouth from and
the UK together now so I'll link that
down below as well I'm just going to
glue these up and then leave it sitting
for a while you usually do this
performance scared of what I'm going to
remember that the last ads good old days
if you are not sure if they're even or
not a good thing to do is kick a selfie
and because it Phillips you can really
see what Peaks you've made oh my god you
know what I'm actually favored that I
can live y'okay wow that's a really good
tip for anything if you're worried that
you're Elena is not even or your brows
aren't even if you take a selfie because
it flips you can it's like a different
perspective so it's a really good way as
well as a makeup art is to put this on
your symmetry and things and once your
lashes are on that is the look finished
so that is the finished look you guys I
hope you liked it please let me know if
you recreate a slick label on Twitter or
Instagram I would love to see your looks
and other than that I will see you guys
