I'm going to show you how to create this
Halloween like so Remmel London got in
touch with me and the same we we love
you to create a look around this
lipstick so they have brought a brand
new product called the only one matte
lipstick so basically is just a really
gorgeous lipstick range they are really
really pigmented they have a really
beautiful texture they're really fab
call is well so they gave me this color
is the shade 750 and I general it really
reminded me of the first ever time that
I actually add best look so this is my
fourth year in a row create in this
kinda Halloween look so it's one of my
favorite looks to do it's super easy
once you know how to do it and so it
inspired me to create this Halloween
tutorial for you guys not only have they
brought out that new product but you
have a new kind of way to shop if you
will there is a new lip library on
Rimmel London's website so I'll link
that down below if you'd like to see how
I created the slickest itchin
I'm going to start with the glam side
first just because I think easier once
I've got this taken it done - then go
ahead with the skull so the first thing
I want to do is I'm gonna clean my face
with the effects imperfect by Rimmel
this is just a really good frame where
it's a good all-rounder so I'm going to
put that on all over obviously we're
using makeup on both sides here today so
you can prep your whole face now my
skull site is going to be there safe so
i'm going to glam this safe first and we
went with the match perfection
foundation by Rimmel again and this is
the shade 200 soft beige so I'm just
going to take a couple pumps on one side
and then I'm just going to apply that
with a bugle endure those foundation
it's fab actually it's really really
good nice coverage not to hear thee and
I think it cannot advertise itself as
invisible coverage so you can't really
see how thick it is maybe medium to full
coverage you can build it right up but I
do like my skin to be more on the dewy
tight so with that cream underneath it
really works next product I'm going with
as the
perfection so it's the same as a
foundation but this is the concealer and
this is the shade soft beige and number
four eight and all you do is you go a
little squeeze product comes up and then
you just paint on I'm just going to
highlight underneath my eyes a lot my
Clippers ball I'm going to leave my nose
area I'm going to go up here my forehead
soplease it use because you can just
squeeze how much product you need and
for me I don't think you need much of
this which is good obviously and then
I'm just gonna blend that it with my
Beauty Blender as well
now once that was on you pretty much lot
of perfect believes I am going to go in
with my Kat Von D list paper and I'm
just going to take that on my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to be I believe my
eyes and I like to just go on the sides
of my nose as well as I know that's
where I move the moss well I'm waiting
for that to say I'm going to go in
straight to my eyes I'm going to go in
for my Mac Paint Pot in the shade lien
law and because I have no nails at the
moment I can go straight and with my
finger and I'm just going to appear that
whole eye
I'm going with my Too Faced chocolate
bar palette and I'm going to just start
create a really nice kind of similar I
to start with and I'm going to go in
with this shade here white chocolate all
over it to mattify it and then I'm going
to go in with this shade just to start
defining my crease the brush I'm using
here is my Mac two to four it's just my
favorite brush for mattifying the iron
and starting to create some definition
it just works really really real now I'm
going to swap my brush over to my weave
or two to four it's just a little bit
smaller and we're going to go in with
your shade here which is called milk
chocolate it's just like a slightly
darker but still warm Road and we're
just going to find that crease a little
bit more
now I'm going to when we're clean up
flat brushes is the 250 from Smith and
I'm going to push that white chocolate
sheet onto my lids to completely mattify
that so there's no creasing throughout
the day and also to keep it super super
matte I'm going to take my Smith one 1/2
brush and just dust away that powder
underneath my eye to reveal a perfectly
set under eye and then I'm going to take
my 204 from zoeva and the milk chocolate
sheet again and just buff that under my
eye to create a nice smoke under there
once we've got that one you can
highlight that up one if you like I'm
going to go ahead and do that with the
shade champagne truffle which is just
here
I'm just highlight my browbone there as
well I'm going to go in with my
wonderful mascara this is Rimmel's a new
mascara that's called argan oil infused
which is wicked for people like me who
wear falsies every day so it's
conditioning your lashes at the same
time now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pull on my lashes my lashes a
choice today are the photo latch by huda
beauty
they are super thick they're really nice
lashes I'm going to wait for those to
dry and then I'm gonna quickly fill in
my brows I'm just going to use my
hardest r0n medium brown with my Smith
205 brush its part I'm just going to
fill in my brows like normal so it still
is actually pretty natural this and then
I'm just going to set that glow with my
Anastasia brow gel brushing up at the
front and then just through the pro
towards things so just up that lash on
super quick and if you have a look that
is where the drama starts now I'm going
to finish off my skin on this site I'm
going to go in with my NARS bronzer and
Laguna and just I'm going to create some
once on the site powders go on this
foundation really nicely well it's kind
of turning out to be like a para to make
up hum I'm just going to go in with
there cut all pearl to
intensely highlight
and then I'm going to highlight my nose
anyway I know I'm going to be doing my
little skull but I think I will work for
a little bit of added Halloween glam I'm
going to go in with my heavy metal
glitter and juncture this is by urban
decay and I'm gonna create a little kind
of letter triangle underneath my eye so
I'm going to leave that say my face
finished like that I'm not going to do
my lips yet and let's move on to this
side so this is the this is important
part we're going to end up with Ella
mask is can be sand shade z21 so this is
white it's just a white foundation I'm
going to take a decent rent it out of
the back of my hand
and then we've already primed the side
of our faces so we're just going to
start to apply that there's some areas
that you may need to go over a little
bit more and I'm just kind of bringing
that to roughly the middle of my face
and just blending that and know what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my
Rimmel brow pencil this is the shade
room that room and I'm going to sketch
out my shape so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to sketch out
the eye hole so I cover up my below I
find that the easiest means you don't
need to conceal your brows with glue or
anything and I'm just creating a rough a
shapes or what you can do is I've done
the skull a few things obviously so I'm
rough i roughly know what I'm going to
do it but if you feel like it'll help ah
rough guideline is easier to draw when
you have a picture of a skull right in
front of you and then I just go
underneath my cheek bone and then down
and then that just connect creates the
shadows I like to just shoot that all in
and then the nose part I just cover up
that whole part my nose I'm gonna go
down the middle and then this isn't
anatomically correct but I feel like it
looks better so when I'm doing a fill
skull I'll just have the two triangles
up the sides but when I'm doing a half
skull I do the two triangles at the size
of those
I know Graham Gwen and I can start
filling things in and will like a little
bit up here with my temple and I like to
cut the jaw and then the rest of it you
can kind of do with shade and things
like that makes it a little bit cooler
the first thing I'm going to do
and I'm going to take the Rimmel black
gel liner this is everyone's can I go to
drugstore liner item and before I start
I didn't make up everybody had this it's
just like it's just one of the base gel
liners on the market for sure and I'm
just going to go in with the little
brush a commons way and I'm gonna start
going over my eye going right into the
drive here's and yes this is not the
easiest thing to clean off your face and
I'm just filling in that whole soul kit
going right in the waterline i'm going
to tightline my eye you know what that
actually isn't creasing that bad at all
okay so it looks a wee bit weird when
it's just like a big blob but it comes
together I swear and the nice I'm going
to do is I'm going to go in with it
magnifies and this is a big cool black
pencil so this is really good for years
and an emblem tonight so I'm going to
start by doing this cheap born I'm going
to just start sketching under here and
then I'm going to start blending that
out so I'm just going to use an
eyeshadow brush this is a urban decay
one and the cause core pencils so soft
they just blew and really easily
I'm actually going to bring that up a
little bit higher just here so it kind
of goes over the teeth I'm going to do
the same thing under here but you can
just sketch it on and then blend and it
just it's so much better than having
like a sharp double pencil if you know I
mean now we're do the same thing to my
head and if we write into the here
linear as well I'm gonna do it in always
now and when it were back home with the
jail because noses are the things we
touch them off so I want it to really
last I'm just going to color it in the
little shape of it and then I'm going to
swap into my scandalize or later pan
again and I'm just going to really neat
not up use the side of that pin to get
it nice and sharp I like to kind of get
the biggest parts done and then go in
and add all the detail which makes it
look like good so I'm going to go in
with this pan and I'm gonna get that
line and then I'm going to draw a line
here for my teeth are going to start now
obviously I can't speak
identity firmly tell you what I'm going
to do I'm going to draw up lines the
whole way along really easy and then I'm
going to create the teeth effect but I
add in tiny little triangles to the tip
of each lane and then we're going to use
eye shadow to blend that upwards to
create the day okay so so it's just
easing that and I've seen a lot of
tutorials they just leave the teeth like
this as well so if you want to make it a
little bit easier feel free to do that
now I'm going to do is I'm going to add
the little triangles to the top of each
lane so
I'm going to run with a really small
brush this is the Smith three or four
brush it's just tiny tiny tiny I think a
obvious is a lip brush in the past and
I'm just going to smudge that later
cause the weight foundation zero already
it just blends really easily
I just like to smudge the lane we've
created as well up there I'm just going
to darken up in here wow that's likely
oh and then I'm going to dark out the
lanes in between the teeth and make them
not so neat and tidy this skill and does
not have any ears now if you like you
don't have to do this but if you like
you can darken it up a little bit with a
little bit of eye shadow so I'm going to
go back in with my chocolate bar palette
and I'm actually going to go in with
this sheet here the shade abused to
transition the colors and I'm just going
to add a little bit more date in between
those teeth and I'm just gonna shoot in
right round dome as well now to make the
teeth whiter I'm going to use the 24
hour color precise eyeliner from Rimmel
and this is just white and this is such
a great trick because obviously it's
hard to make foundation that weight and
it's like to use the pin on its side but
if you just little touch it of that when
you pat it on like so if you've got no
sessions the bottom teeth look a lot
whiter
and when you pass on it means you're not
dragging the product which means you're
not going to get foundation all over
this I'm going to use a little bit of
the scandalize eyeshadow stick if you
have a look
it's actually really bright white I'm
going to use that to highlight okay
let's add some cracks so we've got all
the can a key components now to the
skull what I'm going to do is I'm going
to start sketching that with my gray
pencil they can a cracks around the eyes
I'm going to add some cracks in just a
bit here in the face and then I like
when it's a half-scale type of crack
come and go in the middle like it's half
a face if you know me so there's all
this one here there's always one
underneath our eye somewhere
and we want on top with those little
tracks with my family no pin I use for
my teeth my tip for this is hold the pan
nice and far back it means that your
hands kind of shaky and then that's how
you get to profane lanes nice cannot
cracks and then you can kind of drag
some of the gel liner up as well which
makes it quick cool shadow the nice
thing about skulls is they're not neat
and tidy you can do it on really neat
kayvyun can i anatomical if you want but
Halloween's a little bit fun I'm
actually going to go in with a little
bit at a cherry cordial color here and
I'm gonna use that to help blend out
some of the darker areas the reason I
loved in a skull for Halloween is it so
cheap to do because most it has makeup
you already have and those of his father
to you you'll use again you know I'm
actually going to go in it with this
champagne shuffle color so I'm going to
highlight all the kind of key points of
this look we already put that I shadow
pay and sell I want to be a glowing
skull and I've used really kind of
easy-peasy eyeshadows which means most
of you hopefully have some of these in
the house already so a lot of this look
is just kind of going back and meeting
in different parts up so once you're not
happy with the skull part you can do the
lips another side so obviously I'm going
to lay my lips fresh quickly with
nighthawk liner by urban decay and then
I'm going to use this beautiful lipstick
by rebel so this is the sheer number is
750 and then just gonna mmm these smell
honestly so good that I'm such a nice
color so I'm gonna go and I'm going to
tweak some little bit I didn't actually
powder this ice this eyeball do I need
to do it yeah I'm going to go back over
it with this cream because I think this
is really black and I'm just gonna
really dark not up it's up to you and
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to finish
this I off with my lashes and mascara
because even though you won't really be
able to see the lashes it's nice to have
them on so you guys I'm going to go I'm
going to stuck
my eyelash have a closer look see if
there's anything else I want to touch up
and change and then I'll come back and
see you in just a sec tada and that is
my high loving look guys I hope you like
it all I did was stuck my lash on I made
my lanes a little bit darker around my
eyes
I brought the shadow a little bit higher
on my teeth and then in a darkened the
teeth up a little bit as well and then
made the quite a little bit stronger
just by going in on top of it again
so with that slow you can spend as long
as you want on it or you can be quite
quick I hope you like it that's looks
like a stunning obviously that is prior
here thank you so much trouble
for making this video happen I hope you
guys liked it and I hope to see your
recreations on Twitter and Instagram and
things like that and I'll see you next
time with another tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
