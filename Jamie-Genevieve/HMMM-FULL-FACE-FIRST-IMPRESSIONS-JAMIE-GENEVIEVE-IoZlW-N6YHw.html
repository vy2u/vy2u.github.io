I am going to show you how to create
this entire look using products I have
never used before
and there were some products in here
that I thought I was gonna absolutely
love that I really been I didn't expect
to not like the things that I did not
like and then there was a few products
here that I'm really excited about that
I've tried them so I feel like this year
I created this look then please teach
you know I've just washed my face I'm
not crying
my eyes are just freshly watered
hopefully all this beautiful new stuff
is going to meet the goal from knee to
hell yay so I have a bunch of new
products here I've never used before and
I'm very excited so some of these things
and a little bit older some of them are
as new as possible to primer face I have
the touch-up silk canvas and I have
heard amazing things with this
it smells good it comes with this little
spatula knock it away I would probably
lose this and then I will go and just
start using my nail to dig into it which
is not gonna be pretty
it has a little gay Blaine I'll show you
I'm gonna be a proper youtuber today it
has a guide line on it so you skip the
product up to the gate lane and notice
how much it makes to use so let's do
that tells you to use a really little
moon actually I might go let me go the
distance
so attached are is primarily a skincare
brand so it looks like they're going to
go the makeup route Wow okay
so I take back my first thoughts it goes
a long way
it does feel silky very good name for
the product at your Wiltern Wow
so it basically stops your makeup I
faith in your skincare and it stops your
makeup from the gain and your pores and
stuff like that that feels lovely smells
nice and light no strong perfume or
anything excuse my hair this is a little
trick tip for you
today I am going to Paris obtaining and
whenever ready to wash my hair that day
anyway I put hair mask in my hair and
just brush it out and then put it in a
little little button but when your
makeups all done and you've got like
eating Zen you look pretty complete you
look pretty diamond but you've got hair
mask into your repeating through thee
that's genius I'm gonna leave this and
all the water my hair and it's gonna be
stunning the hair mask I've gotten is
the don't despair repair mask from brick
geo the next product is the new it
cosmetics CC cream plus illumination so
this is made to be amazing I've seen so
many people talk about this best as the
shade of medium and I really really
liked the first cosmetic CC cream I
thought it was brilliant
it's an SPF 50 the only thing I would
say is it has some flash back but for
the day-to-day normal person you don't
need to be running every flash
photography all the time so this could
be your new same big let's try it 2
pumps by the back of my hand this is the
shade medium I've not tried it yet I
don't know if it's gonna be okay it
should be little and I'm gonna actually
use the heavenly luxe
all-over complexion perfection brush
this is the number 7 brush from it
cosmetics this is what I recommend you
use it with smells just the same as the
first one I can't remember how I justify
my CC cream I do not feel like this has
given me very good coverage not sure
about this actually I thought I was
gonna love it maybe if it was a bit
darker maybe if I had a darker shade it
would be okay I really loved the first
one and I liked being eliminated so I
don't really understand what is going on
maybe my eyes are just too puffy right
now to it I'm just buffing that in
partly thinking the colour may not be
too bad I don't really like the way that
that looks right now oh do you know
what's weird
I don't like it far away I don't like it
in the viewfinder but close-up looks
really nice yeah I think I've got a
breakout here it's no comment at all
let's go in with the concealers so I
have here the k k WV concealers I've got
concealer number 9 for highlighting and
concealer number 14 for quad today I
also have the list on your iPad or 4b
which I don't really do so we're gonna
try it things here we go on and we've
got the pressed powder which a lot of
people are saying that they're not happy
with the size of this for the money but
we will see her performs so the first
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
highlight just my usual my usual spots
it's good a nice finish and it has added
a little bit of coverage in my middle
areas I'm just gonna blend up my eyes
that's added the coverage I needed
underneath my eyes which is very I'm
wondering about the CC cream I just
didn't like look of it at first but
everyone told me that I was gonna love
it so I wonder if it's maybe going on
top of the primer weird or something
what's that concealer it's like a bit
better so I just feel like this is my
first ever
k'kaw product definitely is not matte it
needs sick I won't want to use that on
my eyes as a primer because that's what
I usually do with my concealer so I'm
just gonna go ahead try that could I
always use whatever concealer that I
have at that moment as an eyeshadow
primer okay that looks a bit there are
the foundation or the CC cream if you
want to call it that looks at there but
it's not covering my blemishes at all in
fact as make them look a wee bit worse
if my skin was really really good maybe
it would be nice I have this as what I
was looking for
I have the k'kaw brush and to try this
powder let's try be okay this is dabiq
powder and this is the sheet number
three there's only three colors in this
so this is the middle one and again
people seem to get a little bit pissed
off with how much product is in there I
don't know man I've got a lot of merci
under-eye powder that thanks probably
the same price that's the same size so I
just went my Real Techniques brush and
sponge
whoa I can't remember the last time I
did this so he did eagle ray oh I've
never done it with like a banana powder
before I look like okay yeah I do not
know if I'm doing this right we're told
that's gone Orange weird
I've got like a ring of darker arrange
powder
we're persisting I would agree with the
sheer number 14 which is dark art and
I'm just going to quarter to be back
let's start small
I wonder if I'm the only person this has
happened to you do not need that much
product enemy I like the finish of the
concealer a lot I'm going to move on to
have bigger brush like a friend Asian
brush aha I went with a little bit of
the foundation the CC cream and just
tidy up underneath his contour
Jesus Christ I like to think that I'm
quite good at patching things up as
really if something has it really worked
then I can just fix it something I can
take myself seriously like I'm gonna
dust this away I think I meant to do
whoa
you can see where it stopped maybe I've
done it wrong maybe I meant to powder
your whole face and then do it let's try
the professor I'm going to use this
brightening powder and issue number
three also on I forgot to set my eyelids
and it's all pretty straight let's do
that first I think I honestly wouldn't
know if I like this or not interns
finished I definitely don't like the
baking powder
I just don't bake I don't be underneath
eyes anymore I like using that nice
little amount of powder because that
keeps it nice and fresh they can see
there's the contour looks nice so she
was obtaining to the amount to brine her
face up right let's just put that to the
same concealer I'm definitely going to
try again because I like to finish all
of it but the powders the two powders I
think I can leave I think I could just
leave them foundation I still don't know
I really hope this gets better for you I
spent 20 minutes trying to do this
already I hope Jack manages to cut it
down let's go and my third one so that's
what I would do next
anyway I have here the new bronzer this
is the shade tan and it's from LC
cosmetics and I really
genetics actually I've only got a sponge
in a candle from him but I know that all
know Lola as an angel and our products
are really good to me she's basically
well known for making this beautiful
friend a shade it was really successful
and it's and she saw though she wasn't
experiencing it so she had to take it
off the market to find a better supplier
that would make it quick enough
basically so let's try our new bronzers
I can tell straight away even I'll link
her bronzer and I know that you can get
Elsa cosmetics on beautybay which is
brilliant because it was leave difficult
to get for us over here for well yeah I
think we can see this you know yeah I
mean everyone's really nice that's the
area of my face is a flipping mess I
feel like going in with my other
foundation I don't know if that's gonna
mess up more that foundation is just not
good enough coverage for me and the old
one was really good coverage I'm really
confused so I'm gonna take a tiny pump
like a third of a pump or my wire sail
all ours
which is my fave and I'm just good at
tying fix this because even the texture
looks horrific okay I feel like we're
really redeeming ourselves the next new
product I've got as the brand new gold
rush blush from benefit is stunning way
to assure you it's like a beautiful
blush oh my first thought was how
pigmented is this going to because it
looks just stripper gold I think as soon
as you start using it the gold
disappears and then it's just like a
nice blush
it smells like little Pokemon you
through okay highlights art is basically
gonna save this because it's going to
fix this transition because I can still
see where the baking powder stopped and
the rhythm of these stars
so the highlight I'm going to use is
from Dole beauty this is the dahle late
and she's showing the braid I don't
think I've used this on youtube before I
had one it smashed I think that they're
quite delicate powders because both of
mine smashed in the space of about two
weeks so you have to be really careful
even put like a cotton pad in there and
if we manage to get those to stick a wee
bit higher it up then it will stop my
face like a so try baking on any rise
and it's really great
I think I'm getting old okay it's so
strange because that foundation seems to
say a little bit and it's not as do as
it was before highlight our noise
ownership is bought and we look at the
base together will be crip at that stage
I love the heat my skin I don't think it
looks bad I think it looks pretty much
like normal I am going to shoot off
camera and quickly do my eyebrows I have
no new products for them
I basically lose my car bro and then my
24a repress a heart from benefit and
that's it I've done that my bros with
these products in the last couple of
videos so you can refer to them if you
want to know how but I will be back in
two minutes
so for eyes I have a new stack from the
milk cosmetics this is the baby girl
stack as 100% flawless and beautiful
really really nice choice for spring and
treatment up there on the grungy sites I
really really love it I really love this
bright orange I have touched that I used
it for one look but I can't even
remember it so as a first impression
okay the first thing I will say is that
there is no transition shade I don't
feel like there's a transition shade
when I went to use it it seemed like all
the colors were super pigmented which is
great but they're all quite dark and
bright so I needed to go in it with
something else so I'm gonna actually use
my bronzer so I'm gonna zoom you ready
Wow let's do these eyeballs so I'm going
to do bronzer at first and in the crease
because the concealer keeps increasing
even though the powder to three times
makes me feel like it's a really creamy
concealer I'm still not mad at it I fell
quite late yet I think I want to use it
again and my own routine linked with my
usual foundation and powder and stuff
and magically just bring a painting
about that's underneath my eye because
my eye just looks a wee bit creepy I had
all like crepes and whatever savory
person no don't tell me
right let's start with this color here
this is called come over and my crease
we're gonna do a nice break for no
bright smoke Oh
see what I mean the pigment is crazy for
the circular motion nice and high on the
crease I like big smoky I like it made
some pasta using the side of the brush
to kind of wing it out a little bit I'm
just using my big fluffy semester brush
and then when I get to the outside I
kind of bring the brush on its side not
scared to get nice and high at the bro I
really like that look personally but
anyone considering getting a melt stack
I very much recommend them I think that
the earth sometime was beautiful
eyeshadows I've ever tried
I love the rustic it's my ultimate
favorite that's what is really gorgeous
I don't know whether I prefer this one
our dark matter but this one if you
don't have any eyeshadows that's color
would be a great one the rust that is
your kind of classic warm brains
okay let's drive by 74 I I'm gonna
change this is actually the darkest
shade in the palette which isn't that
dark and it's called dust yourself off
I'm going to quickly switch back to the
shine bright highlighter just to
highlight lit in a corner we're just
using the big brush to buff that right
underneath I don't really want to use
another pilot so I'm gonna stick with
this and maybe we can just keep it like
this like I used to do looks like this
all the time and I really liked a basic
big smoke with a bike wash and we just
pack this darker color onto the era
corner I'm gonna put a little bit of
this color which is called BB ghetto on
with my finger whoa
just in the middle and it's just a
really gorgeous gold and this and shadow
with a pink shift or a pink shadow with
a gold shift I'm just gonna use my mica
no slashes from really lashes there are
no new lashes out there in the earth in
my position / to
my fancy while we're waiting for their
Lasha to dry I'm going to use the wire
sale volume effect for lash and this is
called the curler this is the brand new
mascara and it's got utterly freaky
deaky worn so if I show you it's almost
like all the products of the paused late
though so you usually back and then you
turn it on its side I need to separate
your lashes
that's how is this great to use to me so
let's just try this bad boy it really
hugs the eyeball
that's pretty as a nice mascara it's
really cleanly can you and you think
there's no clumps at all if you're
liking everything mascara winter you
will really like that because it looks
really nice and clean and safe where do
you see what I mean I've got other
mascaras that are my favorite like the
iconic boom lash mascara but sometimes I
have to take that off and start again
because it goes to clumping keep her so
so far the things I like catch a primer
the LC balloons are beautiful very
excited about this and my usual routine
and mascara and the eyeshadow palette
this blusher is nice but it's pretty
pale on me can't really see it okay
Asha's oh yes I actually did like that
lick with just that mascara the question
for you guys do you rule a every
day
and if you do are they the same time as
the ones I wear or do you prefer I feel
I shadow look like this but just mascara
is my question to you today I need to do
a little freckles I'm still hunting for
a good product for that I didn't like
the one I got from cult do either we
Frank okay and I think it's rubbish I'm
back to using my crap one does the job
but I just don't like it I'm gonna zoom
the opal doing lips what what do you
think I just thought oh I don't know I
wonder if I look in the camera and be
like yeah I love fats I know it's
amazing I think that may be the struggle
of the skin stuff wasn't worth it
I really like their eyes lies a little
far lips I have a new nude this is the
buxom plump plain lip liner and the
shades tails but everyone I know and
I've seen uses ice over their whole lip
and buxom are really well known for our
plumping stuff so let's just try it I'm
gonna use it all over mmm nice it's a
little but later cuz I you know I always
do like a dark but later and a late let
and I kind of leave over troll with this
color so or it looks like we're doing a
natural up today I like that it's an eye
pencil like a big chunky pant so I'm
gonna put a little bit of this like mask
oh this is the veloute I cannot speak
French
Nate rehab lip mask this is why is a oh
and I have only been using it since I
went to Tokyo salt tank please like a
first impressions but I didn't what was
a lip mask and I've just been using it
as he can ellipse lash nudie lip gloss
when I'm just reading later so let's try
this on top hmm it smells absolutely
amazing it smells like watermelon I
wanted to pack it in and it pretty much
got part in a wig
do over what can we use instead
no one's going over the middle up sticks
any worse hey evil I got these melt
lipsticks the nude ones yeah this is the
shade voyeur and it's a matte lipstick
it's almost like a really pretty nude
Evert really sauce guys I don't have
another lip liner I'm going to use liar
lip liner by Urban Decay just to define
this a bit more okay I'm done
all right listen okay okay I filled it
there I mean it's okay sorry guys that
is the finished look I hope you liked it
if you made it this far I really really
struggle I liked everything I think I'm
not your judgey makeup winner I usually
get one but things are absolutely fine
don't get me wrong there's some absolute
belter sand here really really like the
primer the eyeshadow stack the bronze
are at the highlighter the mascara I
really like this lipstick color as well
but I feel like I need a different lip
liner with that and concealer I'm gonna
try again with my usual routine because
I don't think it was very fair that I
was using it and then doing all this
bacon and powder and when I don't
usually do that so I'm gonna try again
and only you know I reckon but other
than that I hope you learned something I
have not to do these videos because they
straighten me and I will see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
