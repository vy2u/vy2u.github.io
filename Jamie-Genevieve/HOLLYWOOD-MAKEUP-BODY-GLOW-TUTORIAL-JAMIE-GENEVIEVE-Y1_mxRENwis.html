I'm gonna show you how to get this
entire look this is this close to a
blonde bombshell that I'm ever gonna get
let's be honest I am going to show you
how to get this entire look
this face this entire makeup lip and it
also how I got my body glow so basically
it's just a super easy quickly to make
your skin look smooth like summer
showing gooey amazing majestic all those
good things ever you'd like to see how I
got this look then please teaching hello
so today I am very excited because I'm
gonna go from nada to hell yeah
first thing I want to do is talk about a
product I heard a shower and I've used
this product right here this is the
Brazilian a body buff by Sol de Janeiro
is my new favorite body scrub and you
know for bumbum Prima's is by the same
time it was my favorite moisturizer for
ages I stumble use that I absolutely
love it this is the scrub that goes
along with that is the scarabeus scrub
and I know that you guys all know what I
mean when I say that but why I do is I
put it on at my sched when it's dry and
then I get in the shower and wash it all
off it leaves you super silky smooth and
it leaves you smelling like an angel
after that I'm obviously just redshirted
shower specially the Daisy and we're
just gonna go into the makeup first and
it will do all the body stuff later so
the first product I've got right behind
me is the Copacabana cookbook banana
bronzed glow oil okay who doesn't like a
go and I am actually gonna fire this
with my hands on to my face because we
want to be really really boy it's like
this you take the top off I'm just gonna
pour a tiny amount this much it looks
super dark do not fray there are two
colors so I think I'm probably in the
middle of the spectrum when it comes to
skin tone I can i usually use medium
shades and foundations medium shading
so I'm going to go over the darker one
for this and that's just apply so I'm
gonna rub my hands together and then
just apply that all over and you can use
this on your face bring it to my neck as
well it's gonna give you a nice glowy
beads to start before your friend eat
you and that's gonna just shine through
and also I have a more tanned body than
I do my face so I always kind of have to
deepen my color to match but that just
gives those you super glowy base to
start we're gonna come back to this for
everybody later but next we're gonna go
in with our primer this is the it's
finicky Beauty pool filter matte primer
everyone knows I love this and I'm just
going to take two fronts of that and
we're gonna apply it the exact same way
rub our hands together and you know just
rub that and that is gonna make sure our
bigs
is gonna last all day next up we have
foundation this is the Oliver's
foundation from YSL I've been using this
for a long time now absolutely little
bit I'm gonna take one and a half pumps
and we're just gonna apply that with a
brush I haven't need to clean menopause
 but I don't want to all over
the states and even though we're doing a
super glowy look I want to have a super
flawless base nice and full coverage the
color that I'm using as b16 I think I
sent BT 60 before but it's be 60 I'm
just gonna use this all over can I still
come flesh and I get a little too the
quest from you guys asking me to do like
a holiday tutorial and hope there's my
makeup laughs along and these hot places
and things like that honestly I do this
I do it there's not many other steps
other than maybe adding a little bit
more popular that I would do so you can
consider us the holy makeup tutorial
also moving up my neck a little bit then
I'm just gonna go and on the center of
my face with a little bit more product
build up the next product is the Laura
Mercier
flawless fusion ultra longwear concealer
this has replaced all of my favorite
concealers for the moment I think it's
brilliant and I just apply it like so
and it just has the most
you finish but as enough coverage to
highlight and to cover up any kind of
darkness underneath eyes and then just
kind of like enhance the rest of the
face and I just blend that in with the
same brush and I'm going right up to the
eyes but not over them and even on it
still coverage you can still kind of see
my freckles through it it's just perfect
it does it does a really good job of
covering up my redness as well luckily
the next product I'm going to use I have
tried for about a week or two and I've
not actually talked about it on my
youtube channel before but this is the
Tarte shaped teeth I train by and I
think it's pretty creative so I like the
little component I like this like a pin
that I'm just gonna scrub all over my
eyelids gonna get a little small blender
little blender brush and we're just
gonna bust that out on the eyelid don't
need much of this and it's not as full
coverage as using your friend Asian or
concealer on the I would be is quite
nice it doesn't blend coat your lids too
much another good tech for this look is
to not only exfoliate your body but
dutifully at your face as well because
then your skin is super fresh and then
it gives you that nice glow without
actually having any product on because
you're just gonna sort of smooth next
thing we're gonna do is just slightly
powder so we're gonna powder or legs I
brought in I'm using and my favorite
extract every airbrush flawless finished
podo absolutely love this stuff hit pan
gonna need a new one soon and I use the
shade number two they are super
translucent there's not much color to
them so it don't worry too much about
your shade and then I'm just gonna pray
that under my eyes okay for bronzer I'm
gonna be using my LC bronzer this has
been getting used
I need see that the rapist hurts come on
this isn't a shade time I'm very excited
because you can actually get a splat on
beautybay knife it's quite hard for us
to get for a hot SEC but we can get it
now and UK so I'm just going to use this
to bronze up my face and always start
small make sure it's super blend back
then you can add some more don't go too
heavy with your
the first beautiful halo of gold bronze
uploading my channel uh Tibet and down
the neck make sure there's no lines and
I'm gonna take a bigger brush this is
just my morphe M 402 and I'm just gonna
take a little touch of the bronzer and
just bronze up my face a little bit more
willy-nilly you know a little bit more
crazy feel good about that and they
failed with car bronzer and our hands
this is what we're going to use on our
eyes it's a super common technique and
it also means that you're using one nice
product just grab your bronzer go on
with an eyeshadow brush and we're just
gonna use the bronzer to define the
crease keeping it nice and high up and
when I used to look nice and open and a
good way to do that is just tilt the
head back you can see where your crease
falls and it's just bronzer so you don't
eat or a bit go in too dark because
you've got our base on it's picking up
the product just like an eye shadow make
sure you don't close your eyes when
you're doing this because otherwise
you're gonna end up with the shadows too
low down and it's gonna defeat the whole
purpose it's gonna make your eyes look
smaller keep your hands nice and open
good and then we're gonna do the exact
same thing under our eyes I'm going to
take my smaller brush again create that
shadow just under the eye and it looks
like barely anything but that's what we
want
perfect now from this day I'm actually
gonna stopped in my eyes we're gonna go
much higher in search so this is you
guys it's been a while this is
background ol pal
this was my absolute phase B for so long
and it's been set on a drawer being
neglected and it's back so I'm gonna
grab my little zoeva
once before brush thanks highlight and
brush or just gonna highlight all the
high points in our face we want to be
super glowy beautiful and perfect start
and her cheekbones
miss got that glow coming through our
whole skin enemy from using the oil as a
primer praying primer primer
Kramer but this is gonna just highlight
all the good bits so we're doing our
cheekbones above her eyebrow and then
I'm gonna go into a slightly smaller
brush and we're going to highlight our
pride bone
Nessus why with your brows after
highlight because all the powder is
gonna get up in there
highlight your Cupid's bow we're gonna
highlight our nose just the tip oh oh my
camera for guys that's like a super
skinful case I don't really want to
cause too much attention to the pros or
the eyes so I'm gonna do a fair little
late bro and for eyes we're just gonna
do it mascara and lashes so the first
thing I'm going to do is take my 20
forever bro set but then this is the
base bro chill ever if you've not tried
it you need to go get it and I wouldn't
just comb through my brows and get them
into place and the gel is really thick
so once it says it's set you don't you
to worry about your brace and you feel
free to kind of brush your brows up get
them nice and bushy and then while we're
waiting for those to dry listing mascara
so I'm just gonna use my Maybelline lash
sensational lash multiplying mascara
this is just a really nice mascara that
will get your lashes looking nice and
separate eggs and long and this mascara
is got one of those brushes that hugs
your eyeball which makes it so easy I'm
a scary day to me what's our bottom
lashes
oh crap why I'm waiting for my lashes to
dry the lashes I'm using by the way our
lovely lashes Miami stay okay what we're
gonna do is go back to our eyebrows I
really like my eyebrows really like not
done pretty much no but get me grow by
benefit is thick it was off the market
for about six months eight months and
it's back I know it's called gimme brow
plus so it's even better and we're just
gonna apply this through our brows which
are already jailed and
and it's just gonna add a little bit
more color and thickness just looks
better and a little bit more grip a
little bit more layer and the cause
we've done our jail underneath the
brazier already and the place it need to
be they're just waiting for our lashes
to dragon whoa oh pretty when you put
your lashes on always make sure you have
a good play around with them until
they're pretty much dry and then you
know they're not gonna pay off so I'm
just gonna apply my little friend code
and then we've got this stage I'm gonna
go ahead and highlight my inner corner
of my eyeball with Becca or pull again
and you can use this just to do a little
bit or you can kind of bring it on -
this whole links section of your eye but
forgot to bronze my nose so the way that
I do that is pretty easy grab my bronzer
get a little bit more bronzer brush and
then I just bring right through and I
brines right up to like this bit I never
know what to call it the bridge of my
nose and then if you go too much then
describe your foundation brush and you
can connect calm it down for Eclipse I
thought that I would do it your bullet
I'm gonna go with just a classic great I
really want to eat a red luck today so I
just think it kind of goes with a
holiday fight as well the color I'm
going to use is Urban Decay 71/4 liner
and then I'm going to use the color pop
collaboration with Alice Hawaii
she must sassy friend she brought I
pretty much the perfect red liquid
lipstick so I'm going to use that today
first we will learn on lips
okay let's try that I do not know if
this is gonna look good it's a little
bit different than my usual shape and
then next is so pigmented the oh and I
forgot to say the name of this this is
the liquid lipstick in the name re ba
like a cuckoo cabana and Arriba on my
body right now
see what I mean sadly pigmented and my
perfect is need to leave that to die
absolutely love this color
okay body time so I think I'm in the
clear
I can take you hey I'm naked we're gonna
do now is we're gonna brand up our
bodies so I'm gonna get my necklace says
oh the way and what we're going to do is
we're just gonna use our hands and we're
going to go in with the same oil the
Copa Cabana and we're just gonna put it
in our hands I'm gonna take off my rings
are actually and I'm just gonna use this
in my hands I'm gonna get a theater made
these oils are marketed there's two
colors obviously like there's two codes
obviously these smell absolutely means
and there's two smells so that's darker
when smells like from mom creams and
then the lighter one has a different
smell that's also gorgeous they are like
a dry oil so you don't feel sticky once
you've got them on they're just super
smooth I'm gonna bring out you don't
need to worry about them feeling sticky
or anything like that they go on all
this sadness use my hands and they're
going on like a dream and I'm gonna show
you that other color I'm just gonna put
it on top and even though it's a shimmer
it's like a nice shimmer you know it's
not may tell you don't look metallic it
looks like a natural wool and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to take the
Empire in my sunset royal service funds
later I would say if you're anything
later than me then I would get I would
get that one and I'm probably gonna use
this one as well to be honest
smells create and obviously they're
really hydrating as well and then if you
are on your holidays obviously this will
just look perfect with the turns but you
can also seek a tan I've put them over
my tattoos and it doesn't make them like
Dorji at all it just gives a man a chain
so don't worry about your tags because
there's some sharing body oils that make
my tattoos like so ugly
and like giddy and nasty so these don't
do that and then all I'm gonna do now is
I'm gonna add a little bit more shimmer
just right on the PI points of my
shoulders because when you've got that
nice like not sticky put that oil
underneath it just grabs on one we bear
some letting her bank bronzer brush grab
some of this Haley what am i shame your
little shoulders top tip if you come
between your boobs it just gives you
that a shame oh my god and by I than
that shimmer you just get the overall
body glow but then you've got and make
sure I'm going to put my breath back
what I feel very exposed right now and
then what you can do I've got my brought
back once I can show you I'm just
putting highlighter actually on my boobs
and there you go and that's what gives
you the authority that amazing Oh Shane
and though I look like I'm all done up
apart from my hair so I'm gonna go and
fix my hair and I'll be right back so
you can see about a quick brush over
here and I off-the-shoulder why you
