I am really lovely taiwan i have teamed
up with matrix and they have the system
it's a three step system and it's called
the reborned and it is all about putting
the heels back in here here no you guys
know that this is not this is not my
natural color I'm a chemical blonde so I
really need to look after my hair and
Lord you guys are actually comment and
ask before I use and how often are you
certain things that learn so this fog
it's going to be completely dedicated to
this treatment we're going to try out
today
Jamie Stevens is the ambassador of Jamie
it warns for Cylons in and around London
that our matrix Cylon so he is like the
professional he's gonna be here at teach
me all about this treatment and teach
you guys because I am awful education
not product but we are going to try it
Jimmy's gonna do the N salon treatment
which is basically if you go to a matrix
Island you can get this treatment and
then what you do is you take it home and
it's a home system as well and the
kicker the best part is as do the
affordable so these treatments I know it
allows you to go exactly what Reitmans I
use in sometimes they're really
expensive you have to budget these
things these are not necessities so it
is ten point specially for each part of
the system and we're gonna try out let's
hope it works
you're not shy it'll being credit but
look at those amazing salad isn't that
great
and I've even got my coffee tea this is
gimme you're gonna sort my head out
Jamie and Jamie Jamie and Jamie this
could get very confused and then I've
already go although this is my nice
little seat here right I've gotten a
little coffee a water and in this is the
system that we're gonna be using so
Jamie do actually let's do this could
you look on the cup I know actually half
my head sure like that great I'm gonna
pack up a father I can I want you to
tell me what it does
number one matrix total results the
reborned
number one strength rehab system shampoo
tell me Jimmy write some we will start
with number one
yeah you'll notice that there's one two
and three yeah normally you would
obviously do one two and three
yeah but look at this you would actually
do number one which is the shampoo first
and to be honest you wouldn't
necessarily do anything different with
this shampoo like you would a normal
shampoo okay so something about the
rebound so it's all about the
strengthening cleansing the scalp
cleansing the hair getting rid of any
kind of all your oils and we all signed
up of product because I will say you
know clean and healthy scalp will be
including healthy hair so the reading a
structure so general tips and tricks I
would say when you're shampooing first
application try and use a Tempe piece
size way too much it will overuse
product
okay so first one and then always kind
start through your mid links and your
ends and then work it back into your
side you'll find that most first shampoo
applications your hair won't lather that
much so that's when people go in
anything but I need to put more on me
okay let the product do the work rinse
it out doesn't always have to be a
hundred percent bleach down okay so as
long as it sort of 70 to 90 percent gone
okay second application always do two
shampoos we've always okay then the next
one you only need to use like a 5p piece
okay okay so even better sort of value
for money yeah and then that's when
you'll really start to find it the
shampoo really really is doing its work
so looking all throughout much more okay
fully rinsed it down then you've got
number two which is more what we sort of
say the intense kind of recon treatment
so you wouldn't necessarily do one two
and three every time something that says
pre-conditioner yes so it's a
pre-conditioner so we would only ever
say that you use number two okay with
the three-step system at least once a
week okay don't use it every time okay
so let's just say this is the your
application when you're gonna do it yeah
the one week again I'll go to say a good
Tempe piece size okay
distribute it in your hand everyone just
tends to put it here rub it in your
hands okay
for your mid-lengths in your ends okay
okay and then into your root area okay
if you can at home get a wide tooth comb
comb it through yeah again it just
distributes evenly leave it on good five
to ten minutes
great okay I quite like doing that in
the shower I will put my treatment on
and then doing my veins that I might
kind of go against what they say but for
me you know if your hair is heavily
colored slightly more on this or damaged
side and broken yeah I'm not saying the
longer you leave it the better but
definitely give it more of that
10-minute side okay the key is with
number two don't win town don't say I'm
instead okay so will you just put it
somewhere here though yeah so pre
shampooed
okay after step one then you go to step
two leave it in for five to ten minutes
okay
don't rinse it out and then you go in to
number three of the rebonds which is the
conditioner and to be honest you just
repeat in exactly the same process on
top of the pointer smack the number two
the rebonds strengthening conditioner
okay
again put that in more middling to ends
then through to your roots comb it
through and then rinse so probably it's
what you usually do at home but you just
got to be added thing in the middle
absolutely so this is the once a week
sort of real hair intense you know where
people would do like intense
conditioning treatments at home yeah
that's what that is with everything to
get the full benefit you kind of have to
use step one two and three on a normal
time you just go one and three okay what
we do in the salon whenever I we do a
consultation with a new client so before
we even talk really to a client first
thing we do is we assess your hair okay
okay so just I'll take a couple of
seconds just to actually look one at
your growth pattern you know to
generally like the coarseness the
thickness and mainly the condition what
we do is when we test about house all
good and damage the hair in the bonds
are is if you pick up or comb your hair
through and try and get it from root to
tip in hold the ends where you see that
your hair is slightly more denser yeah
this is really good when you see where
it starts to get a little bit more
sparser and a little bit more
see-through that's that is where your
more sort of damages okay okay okay so
it's a really good test another one we
do is what we call like elasticity test
generally better when the hairs wet see
hope and if you pull your hair just
imagine an elastic band yeah
really simple okay when you pull it the
more it sort of Springs yeah the more
damaged it yeah the more sort of let's
bring it is yeah
the better condition is yeah
realistically coloring you know
especially when you're talking about
free lightning yeah you know there's
obviously good ways of doing it there's
bad ways of doing it color is not what
it used to be but generally color damage
processing chemical processing and your
Heat are the three most damaging things
for hair
yeah if not done in the right way refund
will knock all of that out especially
for chemically treated hair I mean he's
right not Lee I think it's gonna change
my way he's gonna change you like don't
judge me too much because I have this is
a real privilege for you a real treat
absolutely
I look at my hair was my favorite thing
yesterday okay we're doing step number
two oh hey okay and we're just gonna put
this through wait here leave it for a
bit and then put the conditioner through
just in you then you're gonna stay on my
hair old pretty oh it's a hard life so
if you comb it through
yeah it just helps distribute that
product evenly from Ritu tip I allegedly
never do that if Steven saw obvious look
that's literally the first application
it's been on there for seconds and I bet
you couldn't normally run a comb through
your my blonde hair you know it great
and then just a little tip all I would
do is just restate and if you want to
walk around for 10 minutes just yeah
just sit there in relax for 10 minutes
fab John so we've got step two on right
now and we're leaving it's cook for 10
minutes at end conditioner then washing
off I'm getting lunch in the meantime I
am hills and here we'll
so firstly yet I do not rinse
Gemelli conditioner so you layer number
three yep straight over the top of
number two nice and even distributed if
you can give it a comb through as well
and then you just rinse this straight
out but if you do this at home and you
don't use number two you can leave
number three on four again at five ten
minutes
perfect pat pat don't rub Pat here don't
rub squeeze squeeze it yes doing it do
which is what I trying to keep that
cuticle when the bonds nice and smooth
and your here is its most fragile steel
when its way out right yep we've just
washed my hair
we did the one two three this time so
shampooed put the pre-conditioner on
left it for 10 minutes and then did the
conditioner and washed out what I'm
gonna do is I am gonna go home and I'm
gonna use steps 1 and City three times a
week so that's like washing my hair like
normal shampoo conditioner one and three
and then once a week I'm gonna use the
preconditioner which is just think about
it as like your mask right so you're
gonna use your mask once a week and
you're gonna do your shampoo conditioner
three times a week and yes I am gonna
wash my hair three times a week because
that's how you get the best results I
really want to taste this so I know
we've done that we're gonna blow dry
Jimmy it's gonna blow dry do you mean
here
I love it how's my hair feelin just
gorgeous
can you feel that difference I just feel
strong and I feel like I wasn't there
investor but it gets sales do you don't
mean that sometimes I don't know I get
nervous no honestly when I use the three
steps of Erie bond and then he
protection spray even if you don't use
any type of iron
hey we're still heat so you guys
finished look it's actually stunning
it's just what I wanted a fleet Benz
nice texture my back and my hair is
feeling nice and strong I'm excited to
try it out for the next two weeks and
see see what's what but it's amazing
because I am actually getting my
extensions put back in so if my hair
isn't smooth and healthy then you're
gonna see exactly where my hair stops
and the extensions start once I get my
extensions and we're gonna keep on yours
and the 3-step treatment and the shampoo
and conditioner and mask the treatment
pre-conditioner once a week we're going
to try it out we're gonna see what my
hair's gonna look at the end kind of
wash my hair so I'm gonna use the matrix
reborn system right now shampoo and
conditioner and not the treatment I had
the treatment done already my nature
hitman will be on Tuesday when I'm in
Vegas that's the plan let's go wash our
hair sherizaan there's my stuff I'm not
gonna let you guys see me shower cuz
that's kind of weird so I'll be out cool
dryer here
update we have been away so I have been
away in Vegas and I've been away on a
family holiday and I did not sell me
washing my hair because I thought you
guys probably seen enough of that
so today I'm going to be doing right
here with the shampoo conditioner and
the mask some did all three today since
you last saw me I've also had my
extensions put back in so my hair needs
wash I've been running around on a
family holiday and every Sonny's because
you don't want family like their
brutally honest everyone to see you in
that they all thought my hair looked
great and most of them didn't you guys I
had extensions they clearly don't look -
think I'm enough men could you not go
from here to here in five minutes
every really nice everyone thought my
hair looked really good and the kid
tells extensions at all and I'm not
gonna fill me in the again
I'm getting good at this here malarkey
okay one more wash and condition and
then we're done just back from personal
training and my hair definitely swoosh
so we are going to do our final hair
wash of this experiment so I'm going to
go into the shower now and then I'm
gonna blow dry my hair and we can see
the framing results and really excited
I'm already I've got the goods and
that's girl needs to wash her hair right
now
hello I am finished the trial I have my
products here I used them just the air
today was mask day and I just want to
quickly see if you guys have walked
forward me for a little while you will
know that I am terrible at hearsay like
but I did all this myself
ha I all this myself I'm really really
happy during the trial and more so
towards the end I have been getting
these compliments about my hair people
are saying it literally nice and healthy
and I've actually been getting more
comments asking me to do a video about
my hair care and things like that so
that obviously I could saying I think
the thing that I like the most I would
say is probably the price point is 10
pounds 50 for each thing but know that
I've used it for two weeks I can see
that I've still got tons of this stuff
left like I'm not finished the mask at
all and if I was using a treatment this
often I would run out right now and it
usually costs the same amount of money
for the one top the results I can
definitely see which is great I was
nervous in case I wouldn't be able to
see anything but I do think my hair
looks really really strong and since
I've been sailing at myself that's
usually played in my hair it looks the
worst to be honest which is a shame it
usually looks super frizzy and dry and
rubbish but I actually think it looks
great I think that my hair condition has
improved which means that it blends into
my extensions thank you sir
it's just like an old own positive
review from me to be honest the only
thing that I would see I wish it had as
a nice scent I don't think that the
Saints very strong in it at all and I
like a nice smelling shampoo to make my
hair smell nice that is literally my
only qualm that is it I think that kind
of key differences that I have noticed
are that my hair does feel stronger I'm
noticing less breakage when I brush my
hair I always have black leggings on and
whenever I brush my hair I usually have
a lot fill a blond hair it's not great
but I've noticed that that has reduced
which is great huge thank you to matrix
for sponsoring this video and teaming up
with me it's been really really fun
doing this little taste if you guys
would like to see more videos like this
please let me know it was really fun if
foam because you kind of film a little
bit through the week and it's like a
little kind of diary isn't it so let me
know if you like that
and blue and other than that I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
