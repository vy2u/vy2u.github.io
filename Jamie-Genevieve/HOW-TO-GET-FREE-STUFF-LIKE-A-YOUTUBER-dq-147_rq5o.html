I am talking about something a little
bit different and Flynn start going
touch with me and we said that they
wanted to sponsor a video it was really
really funny of a client I said yes to
it really because I actually applied for
influence there way before I was an
influencer so way before ever YouTube
when I was just going to start an
Instagram I applied for influencer and
basically as a platform where you guys
have the opportunity to receive product
and exchange for reviews so if you think
about it as youtubers gets NPR all the
time and there can I goal for these
companies is for us to get these
products and love them and talk about
them so it happens all the time
I get sent tons of makeup and if I
really love something and of course I'm
going to use it and show you guys when I
started youtube I was the most excited
for the idea of PR packages and the idea
of getting says free makeup it was like
Haven to me and it still eyes whenever I
get a box doing my paws that has makeup
or skincare or anything do really a time
always sources will excited so I think
it's really amazing that this can it
gives you guys opportunity to get those
kind of things as well as well so as a
product discovery platform an app engine
so send those three boxes of fill size
products and only one in return is a
review and for you guys to share your
thoughts and feelings on the product on
your social media platforms obviously
all you have to do in a turn as you
these products and always the schools
when you are given something by
Influenster so everyone knows that you
wear get the de product for free very
very similar to the YouTube community of
what the YouTube community is made to do
I've got some stats here and in 2016 and
fluence acento over 750,000 Phivolcs
boxes or product go to the membranes and
these folks are always either luxury or
drugstore there's beauty products or
stuff for a month so stuff for guys
there's food clothes is amazing I like
listen to jar files where you need to
download system if you want to get some
please pain the next thing as well as
the cure for loads and loads and loads
of different bands if you go on our
website you can see exactly 4 grams the
their show
and it always what's news it's always
new stuff at those new products that
basically don't want to get the word out
about on the website is over 1 million
products and there's over 3 million
people that use the website there's over
3 million members the other great thing
is that it's free to join
so as which like a win-win situation now
I remain very plain I first used it you
do sit for a while and you take quizzes
so will influence don't end up from
whine about your home life if you have
kids if you drive to work all these
different things for your interests are
what you do for work and they're
basically send you stuff that can assist
relief sale so basically I'm going to
show you an example of what they send
out because they sent me a little box as
well so this is a Vox box we have
influencer on the sides and then this is
actually a probably box box so it's
super chic and save the auto and in the
vertebrate II thought I actually had two
of the Barbary liquid let's build it now
these retail from Wendy and you get in
for free so let's have a look look
we've got bright plum number 49 and the
score for number five let's have a
little bit
Paxton's gorgeous frosted glass I've
actually used one of these before
I have a really nerdy one I like a lot
create a muesli texture so if you
imagine you guys if you were the one
getting sent there it's just like being
an Instagram verano youtuber and you get
your little box of makeup you try oh and
then basically you can review it on the
influencer website the gorge
you really product you review them on an
influencer website and then you tell
your social media for and for you Hank
is as easy as that I'm an absolute
ideological center of the box of stuff I
didn't realize it was tremendous there
because the ball because they're so chic
I just thought it was another PR package
so I got rid of those boxes I'll show
you what else I got
I was really excited about this I bought
some ski skincare so this is the
radiance and moisture boosting mask it's
like a sheet mask and then I got the
facial treatment aunt and this is worth
money again I can't believe it and any
comes with a little can I leaflet that
tells you all but for
that tells you how to use it as well and
it actually tells you exactly what to do
it says welcome to your Influenster
profile check n your ski - or regards
what's called SK 2 or ski I think it's
called ski check and your ski Volk foot
and then number 3 tells what you think
pushed review review using hashtag my
innocent hashtag ski so obviously all
these beds bed brands work with
influence toe to get their products out
there and get people reviewing them
genius from saves twenties and then last
but not least I got a wire sale book and
again I just thought it was PR package
because everything comes so beautifully
it's not like get a Jeffy bag of makeup
in it it comes in the Cabal exposed
tissue and it sleeps super chic and then
I actually got the sushi club which I
actually never tried before and it's
such a cold make up for that that's all
it's so well known and so many people by
its I'm afraid to trailers as well I
know that a lot of people use it when
there's not really really near other
makeup they just use a little bit of
those just to highlight and can I touch
up some tricks to try that as well cool
so when you're using the website I
remember that you kind of put down your
skin concerns your skin tone your skin
type things that you like to wear do you
really so we do do your Emma Skye orgy
all sorts of stuff so your profile ends
up super Taylor me to you so whatever
you get through the meal will completely
suit you yeah I just think it's really
exciting and I think it's like a
no-brainer it's really making you think
about it it's almost like a written
YouTube so obviously we come on YouTube
and we make videos and we get reviews
just the same thing but it's all people
that leave these reviews it doesn't have
to be an estimate of how to be a
youtuber so what you're basically just
going through today's in place and
reviews on these toilet and these people
go for free and honestly just like being
in a small way okay youtuber so yeah I
was really excited when these guys got
in touch with me to spread the word like
I said earlier my link will be down
below you can click on that make sure
that you know your questions and like
your social media and then I'm really
excited let me know when you get your
first fall folks when you get your first
photos
thank you so much the influencers

liked it and I hope you enjoy getting
free makeup so you guys that is the
