are back with another hair video so I'm
not sure if you guys saw but recently I
did a video in collaboration with clear
all for their semi-permanent color craze
hair dye and this stuff is amazing
you'll have seen IMX two shades orchid
and Flamengo together to get a super
vibrant colorful hairdo the lasted me
weeks so it lasts for like ten to
fifteen washes since then I have had my
extensions out on a new set put and it
does wash out after about 10 to 15
washes dependent on her later heroes I
really love doing my hair
wacky colors but all of you guys see
that you would love to do something like
that but it's a little bit too much
commitment which I completely understand
this time round I have collaborated with
clear all again and the floor your
fearless
mantra is very much the same but this
time we're going to be using the color
crave here makeup so I'm going to show
you guys follow the colors they are
brought out sex shades of hair makeup
from the collective collection you've
got shimmering corporate shimmering
platinum brilliant amethyst shimmering
bronze and brilliant Ruby and shimmering
rose gold so those are the six shades
just right here as sleep on wash off we
use it as shape the chips before your
use squeeze the tube until the color
appears in the sponge applicator swipe
onto dry hair stands heat with a blow
dryer to lock it and then use water with
shampoo so that stuff is streaker on and
wash off so there's no commitment but
it's super quick really really easy
hopefully I'm going to show you that it
gives you the opportunity to have fun
colors in your hair obviously really
good time of year for those Halloween
coming up I am going to use two shades
I'm going to use the shades
brilliant amethyst and showing rose gold
I'm going to use these two colors to get
a Cana
unicorn eight here too so I'm gonna get
these brushes important to the site and
we're gonna open up these boxes I'm
going
show you what is dad so this is the
colors right here so let's do the proper
one first Amaya here is currently
unwashed I've not washed it for a few
days so it's perfect perfect consistency
for this obviously you can do it her
every Lake when you open it up it comes
just that lets it's got a sponge
applicator oh you squeeze it and you see
it coming out at the top I'm gonna close
that back up we're gonna give it a good
shake there we go there's the color now
obviously I've got blonde hair so it's
gonna hopefully it really show up I'm
gonna take off my jewellery just in case
I don't know what's gonna happen
and the way I'm gonna do this is in
winning section of random pieces of my
hair
so obviously the blonder parts are gonna
show up better but it does work on dark
hair as well so let's take a little
section like this and then you just give
it a squeeze I think I'm gonna use my
hand behind Oh
so I'm just gonna use my hands and I've
got a little towel down here okay let's
try it and blow-dry NSN so just gonna
take a flat brush you can see a little
flash of color under there but I'm going
to try and do it again but a little bit
darker I'm gonna take a piece it's
really close to my face oh that's more
vibrant wow that's crazy it's just like
color in your hair then you see that
okay I'm gonna use this brush this time
there it go can you see it it's like
super late like you can go over it again
and again to get a darker but I really
like how soft and pastel you that is so
what I'm going to go ahead note with the
shimmering rose gold color just try this
give it a shake and let us try that on
this site this does go with my I meant
that I do definitely recommend wearing
old course for this just because it will
take you a little second to get used to
it okay so the sharing rose gold is a
lot more soft but if actually you close
up you can see here that you're starting
to get those rosy tones and in here
obviously the like as much playtime well
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go around
my hair because I've got a lot here and
I'm gonna do a little sections of each
through my hair until it's looking a
little bit more colorful and then we're
gonna sail it
so I've just put flashes of the pink and
the purple through my hair I am nor
gonna lie I used my hand to put behind
my hair just to sponge it on just so I
could keep the sections a little bit
more separate but it washes off so my
hands are totally fine so that's
definitely a good thing
and now what I'm gonna do to stay on my
hair I'm gonna brush it all out and then
I'm gonna curl it using my usual tongue
and we're just going to do beachy waves
and then I'm gonna do some peace but
first I'm gonna do my beachy waves I
think this is really really cute I can't
believe that look how much it goes with
my eye makeup I've got my warm creaks
like usual and my purple eight legs and
that's just like my hair so you could
leave your hair like this but I thought
it would be really cute I'm just gonna
grab a little strand of here so here's a
bit here that's the super pancake and
I'm gonna brush it out and I'm just
gonna do a really normal pleat I am
awful at here you guys honestly so I
know a lot of people in here can do all
this crazy breeds but I can't so I'm
just gonna do my normal the one you
learned her nearly eight years old but I
said this was super trendy through the
summer and I still really love it and
then what you could do if you wanted as
you could get those hearings or any
other can I he takes a cities we call
them please I think the cool breeze and
then if you do it nice and small like
this and nice and tight then you won't
need to use a hair tie but you could if
you wanted to use here tires you could
go and get those little see-through
baubles see-through elastic you brand
ones hey sweetie is that with the pink
here and then you just leave it like
that and then you've got your little
pleat so I'm going to do one another
site that one's a little bit shorter but
you we've got two little fees and then
all you have to do to get this stuff is
shampoo you're here and it's totally
done hey presto so we thought that this
look would be really cute for a unicorn
obviously cuz it's super pastel and
colorful imagine I had a little unicorn
horn here which I did intend on
purchasing but I don't have time so just
imagine the cutest
if you guys are wondering what their
shades that are and prove to go and get
it I will include a link in the bio for
