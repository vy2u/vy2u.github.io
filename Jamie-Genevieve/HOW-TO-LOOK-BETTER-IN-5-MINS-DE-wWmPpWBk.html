I'm in a rush and we were going to do a
super basic total data inside minute so
I understand that quite a lot of my
reviews are really going to intricate
lyrics we take a little bit of time they
are maybe a little bit too dramatic for
like beady things like that so this is
the week that I do when I'm in a rush or
around is normally the maitre d but it's
actually just tiny little sticks that
just make me feel better
and make me look I'm Ivette mortal eyes
I'm just going to get started first
thing that I like to do it this is a wee
bit extra but if you have a cat jail
under die touches these amazing these
are the target 1 z to the pressure by
some part becoming a box o for fright
before because I have up to 4 or 5
steadily this slide you just basically
put them on underneath your eyes they're
really cool a beast open your
eyes filled with dark circles and they
do just make you feel a bit they start
use it more alive so I really do love to
me you can stick these on can it soon as
you wake up when you can get in morning
coffee or anything you can sexy though
and obviously these paintings we go in
take five minutes you put these on and
it's three and you can leave them for
out disgusting minute but if your
cookies on and soon as you walk up by
the time you're kind of Sauron at your
space delay of kinetic thunder joke
obviously already I wash my face just a
face cloth and mace warm water just
going to get rid of any kind a skin any
kind of a products from last night and
things like that
it also just kind of opens your pores up
a little bit and issues can reduce your
skincare the next step and I will take
my killed daily this violent concentrate
I rotate I think a bit signs of these
strokes I thought one of you guys has
commented since that I apply my oil room
you're not meant to wrote these into
your skin and I was ready to know a
little bit she just said to process my
skin and then I same juice to as action
she's really
eh that can be pushing the pushing mixer
s she says you should always part your
products into your skin and since I'll
be doing that we do not repair a
weakness my skin is totally cleaning up
the products seem to be working a lot
better many things so as part into my
skin all over and that really makes you
look so much healthier and can I do all
those good things
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my kills creamy of the
right treatment this is where my
favorite eye cream ever
it's not too handy for underneath your
eyes but it's super nourishing and I
really underneath makeup and it doesn't
crease my makeup at all what I'm going
to do now and don't go a little green or
a skies and rain or my meals cookbook
done yes put on my ring finger and then
again one of you guys commented
considered you're missing it walnuts up
the free feel oil so it in turns into an
oil or more so I can give it a little
rub and then Pat that underneath my eyes
and it all remember that was resistant
as well I think it just helps product
works hopefully it helps it can I move
into the skin better it's not like
you're rubbing you're rubbing your
scared trying to warm up the product
it's already Mason Mason warmed up from
your friend right and you never put your
ice cream over your eyelids because the
heat of the I draw the product and Jesus
all these cool earrings just don't go
there
the next product open ears and my skin
eggplant appear at close to I use back
during the day again I really love it
and I'm really relatable enough for
today I literally it's great sense about
I think I've got enough for today and
then I have to get more so you don't
need too much other good then again I'm
just going to put that in my hands warm
up and push it into the skin
Bhushan if you've got big hands like me
it takes like two seconds so it's nice
and healthy totally healthy know that
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my heart breaker these
highlighting moisturizer with a tweezers
it just
recently at foreign air can ask
athleisure collection so it's really
good educated generation because you got
makes clothes actually that really point
definitely cafes german suitable so
actually feels it travels in german or
makeup line really totally saying don't
feel very relaxed or something like that
will make you feel a bit better so i'm
willing is their first it's basically
just a highly Singlish razor you do not
need much little a little little doors
warm up my fingers onions until I never
practice and usually I just use oh
describe the sword I'm going to do that
so it just gives you a really beautiful
glow to the skin so you should Lincoln
healthy nice ingredients she's got what
we want your wonderful really nice
injury another product I like to use for
the stick as the weather goal from
Charlotte Tilbury I would be really
connect honestly these are both like
fairly similar to an assessment maybe
not as hydrating kristen rights and
moisturizer as I said more of a killer
primer but if you sell really really
nice if you've got a so cool ways each
new step or if you feel like you want to
try a little bit for that realism
neither bourbon it slightly spoke
concealed so obviously my skin I said
it's getting a lot better which is great
but I do have a little bit of scarring
for blemishes cuz that's like soccer
happens and here I've got my Maybelline
vibrator i I've been using this for ages
and middle-aged chap I usually use
underneath my eyes for quite heavy
makeup applications when I want you know
that highlight familiarly twice but the
good thing is is uses the product is
care system they don't do all either
like a little sponge now usually I do
see a lot of people take that off and do
the party with a brush but see for the
kind of get-up-and-go me couple just do
not necessarily so he's going to talk
elevator literally over anything array
spots
so like any makeup this will move as you
touch a C's but because it's such a
light ladies will and probably will
going to move
Trinity but I agree just for a little
bit extra confidence and I'm just using
my fingers to Pat that so I liked into
the skin again this is a gas and gorman
cut what you'll have some painters
beware and beautiful injuries and stuff
but as you do how would you believe
they're handy and it is where then you
can use that and I think infuse a little
bit please - cause I swear I get most of
my lateness so you just connect slightly
perfected you're gentle when you do a
little bit in a little actually make
sure your skin towards intervene or can
I even don't love it smooth day and they
sink Lloyd all good things
no ruin or lecture my little throws I
spoke about this on snapchat and
Instagram stories yesterday but
something that I've been really liking
is the revolt conditioning turmeric from
benefit I saw that on a cool continuous
snapchat and had it already but I never
reached for it and she said using this
every day had been a breeze like a lot
thicker it can a group the cooldown
alertness was real so I was intrigued
I've been using it consistently every
day the last few weeks and order some
eyebrows they're pretty creative snows
they're really going in so I'm just
going to put a little touch of that
through not too much because obviously
it's just your energy and I'm actually
going to put a little bit of real
products through them my browser got so
much better so if you don't feel like
you can drink all about that until
technician reason Athens Olympic so
that's saying it by I'm actually going
to go in with the Charlotte Tilbury
trailer and one of those pencils that
got an angle to it so it's kind of like
a little triangle but I'm really sure
it's a Miss been great for doing I just
kind of place it at this front and just
picking up the underneath Amaro's
quadrants going like thank your product
you can use your finger to blend away
any action and then I just like to
picking up my arch it's like two
features believe me it is really more
bows a little bit looser and all March
so just a little touch underneath here
to make it look a bit we want a bit
thicker and then what I like to do is
just really another endless
Hansel it's really nice and soft and
I'll just go ahead and fill you that
product through just to make sure it's
nice and Nathan said I don't want
anything too cheesy it honestly just
like the really natural rose but it
looks like your boobs are there to
basically see before if you're happy
with your bows that they state that fine
I'm going to go ahead and use my eyes
version of Beverly Hills clear brow gels
that stuff is like called key it's
amazing so I'm just an aside at the end
of my berries and I always have been
Bishop favorite moment so I get my hair
and just can make them with a little bit
more kind of buddy
so don't follow the bro you sheep I
cannot brush them up the weeds and
because this Jill's feel strong it just
cement a listener please make they'd be
touched from them scatter obviously I
look pretty pretty small business can
then when you use the both look mascara
from pure having internet or my bottom
lashes for either move it just doesn't
move it's a consumer calculus codicil
against your creamy legs and all in what
you do it from you can applied and they
scored this to my top and bottom lashes
so that just kind of screams your eyes
and your eyes are a bit very real and it
does just kind of make your clothes that
much finish now again you guys want to
do is always look I'm a school to my
skin already but not enough for me so

put that into the skin and up-tempo
honestly two drops actually move it too
much I use tiny little bit just playing
the dread Rendell is not that into my
nose and they love will keep us close
well they look how much I've got laced
over fast and right so you only need one
drop of good drop and then the only
thing that that is methane is a little
less than sure
my favorite one loser - my favorite
moment at the bank the beauty at Garvey

went on to New York and I use Oh time
