gonna show you how I failed my doctor
here so I have a lot of extensions in my
own here is probably a bit up to here so
I've been wearing extensions for nearly
two years now and I'm sure a few guys
with extensions you'll know it's a
complete nightmare to completely wash
and dry and stale your extensions every
few days so multiplying all myself
included obviously I only wash my hair
probably about once a week so once I
wash it and get it styled a laugh a
little bit for days and then that when
it goes up enough button so today it's
actually be seven of my hair and I feel
if it doesn't look easy at all
it looks super done less because I just
did it but basically I'm going to show
you how I stay all mine here when it
started thank you so much the folks
today for sponsoring this video you'll
see me use their here to layer in this
tutorial I'm going to go through all the
products that I use to get mine here a
little bit more life back into it when
it is a little bit old and tired
so you'll see be using their curling
wands and I also have a coupon code for
you guys which gets you 70% off for
Charles mentioned earlier on individual
as well I think I would like to see how
I say on my skirt is dirty here these
stitches that you're all really excited
but another hair tutorial from me let's
do this it's kind of look cute this is
how right here usually if I'm at home I
am NOT the millions time here person I
have 22 inch extensions they are going
to go way down past the Nestle's I have
long here okay long loan here it took me
a little while to get used to kind of
styling and stuff like that just because
I'm not here very soon
so that is the reason I like to do it
and I have my hair up in a bun for the
day or two or three and you can start I
need to look cute again so that's a
really loose these first thing I do is I
take right here at my bun I make sure to
have it in Kirby
that make sure there's nothing oh also I
have here tensile which is my favourite
singer if you watch my weekly vlogs
you'll have seen that but the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my weight brush that is my my pink
wet grass Pro I bought this at my
hairdressers which is Vanguard and
Addington and waste and gospel and what
you do is you make to brush the bottom
just and then work your way up
so after what we're here for
honestly I would succeed I don't really
watch one here that whole thing with my
stage and then in my ear it fails is
pretty quite a dry and coarse I don't
like to overly overly wash my hair so
these six are fatal so my hair doesn't
look really good easier anything like
that so I hope we wash my hair probably
tonight or tomorrow but I need to look
cute today obviously my hair is all been
colored me I do however I have some
little better here volunteers that
actually was the one link in my hair
which they sometimes hang out F has not
been blow-dry for a while but what I
usually do is if someone's around me
that can connect strange breed it I'll
get a little bit so can I lick corn with
underneath or I'll just literally tie
them and a little tiny bubble behind
right here and then let the wrist but
hang down and that like automate the
easiest thing ever
my hair is all brushed now we're going
to dry shampoo I just tend to defecate
the dry shampoo I do have the tooth form
tape dry shampoos I like to use them at
the very end when I need some volume but
for actually getting my hair feeling
kind of cleaner
I like the tart here goes dry shampoo
which is vegan and cruelty free and I
also like the detox dry shampoo which
I'm not sure if that speaking are truly
free or is going to leave money on it so
I'm actually going to use the detailed
quantity and get it from Sephora and I'm
just going to take my hair in section
and give it a three make sure I'm
getting followed it make sure you don't
forget the back
and then I just give that a rubbin and
already you can see them in your loop
super fluffy it's so full of me I'm
gonna die
so lady has given us tons of volume is
not too easy anymore they look like a
size she just said she had a build rack
and then while I did is just get another
brush through make sure there's no white
bits
look at that Cherie so much better so
that is the cult taking kid or no for my
vengeance immediately from here down at
all extensions by selling to you heaps
take their so our the we wear necks at
Coachella and the eating but we reckon
and we got some products from them and I
am believing like the red can heat
resale and technology so I'm going to
use this just through Matt here it's
mostly to the ends brush it through a
little bit make sure it's not too to
work so now we are all jusht row just
bumped up take care curl these bad boys
so today I'm bringing you the foxy be
wonder looks 25 millimeter curling wand
okay so come to the super chic box and
such a sucker for news pathogen but it
is a curling iron at comes this is is
just virtually the cylinder which I like
and it's inside the box you have the
little bit clip that also has a back a
here temperature chart so tells you
exactly how hot you should have your
iron so I already know that I'm going to
do my here about 180 degrees Celsius
that's for normal to wavy to can of
course here which is who I've got and
the Box you also get eight below to stop
you from burning yourself
ah that's another clip they can see put
your glove here and then you also get a
really neat pouch to keep your curling
iron end which I like because it music
mark you'll get all cotton and it's got
a cute little foxy be bit
so I mix up this bad boy in it's also
got a little belt or thing to help keep
some wires on scanner I have turned it
on you turn it on there's a button right
here and then there's up and down arrows
which is cool because you can actually
choose what heat you would like the item
to be so imagine you have super super
fine delicate here and your apparel and
your hair with something that was made
for more like my hair it would just it
was like dyed with it so you can kind of
figure it out however what you want your
here to your tone to be some really good
charm and I can see four wavy to course
here is 372 410 Fahrenheit
so I'm going to go up to the 17th which
kind of translates to 187 degrees
Celsius that's hot so we're going to
leave it Libby ref knots and see it
going up jr. so the way that I do this
is super easy I get my hair and get my
sons and I go round at the top of my
ears to say sweep my hair and then mess
all this hair I just taught North toast
just like that then what life is all
extensions cut you might have got a
little bit more near the top I'm just
gonna brush through that make sure it's
nice and smooth now I'm going to put my
little gulab on you can see here that at
370 which is perfect that's exactly what
one feel the heat coming off it and I'm
just going to grab a little section here
put the governor on hand obviously
and that parent and I expel mostly just
the bottom of my expansion and I'm just
going to hold this here survey came to
15 seconds consumer here is getting
harder and then you just kind of lay the
cuddle wallow in your hands get a little
second to get a cool off a little bit
oh it's perfect look perfect so I'm just
going to do that I'm going to continue
it in a max going to come right here the
same way around the hallway and you can
see the de battle as a rose gold but
it's also made a titanium so it will
give you the longest glass and curls you
don't even really need to hold the head
on for a 50 and say oh that's crazy it
is so quick that was small teaser here
so I just helps a little bit less a
little bit less time so super Carly and
then we just leave them like that the
time being I'm hoping to hear straight
away anything and then we're just going
to continue around the hair and do it
all over and using the thermal
protection stays really important
because not only does it protect you
here but it also helps it connect stay
in place as well some only really ruled
in a year for maybe came taken hold a
shake I'm going to take my club off
crack and we're going to safely or here
again and what I do now is I just go
along at the top for my expansions are I
mean a brush the hair dye promote
collagen so it's nice and smooth we're
going do it again so again we're curling
away from the sea I can't believe how
much of a difference having this glove
makes and we're just going right around
all over again and this barrel is 25
millimeters which goes like the parasite
cut off how in the glove on Israel
really helps with your grip of the hair
of notice usually I would be kind of
slipping a bit and because you can kind
of touch
battle that hurt yourself bullets I'm
like the little of muti that is majority
of it all curls we've got to just take
the top section out though we're going
to give it a little brush it's still all
slippage from the dry shampoo sorry
folks and I we've got super curly good
at filling brush down under here
and if we've got one here which I kind
of came to it but it's not quite there
yet so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take my color and I'm not going to do
this too long unless you're going to go
around keep oil seconds around here just
going to wrap them around pull it for a
couple of seconds let it go and that is
going to make it a little bit more kind
than what you do is you can grab little
sections from the extensions Cola and
respec and what we were a lot the fringe
I like to do for two seconds just so it
sets nicely again I'm just curling it
away from the face and if you want a
little bit of volume here what you can
do is you can use the curler by itself
and you just cannot straighten this one
and then gives you that nice lips I'm
going to take this off turn the tormal
the good thing about this as well as if
you leave it flat it lies above whatever
you use I've got a glass top here some
stuff earlier notice about these oh so
these are all Kyle's but the melting
brush so you always make sure you brush
your Colgate I'm going to take the
weight brush and gently run my brush
right through the colors and you see
that and then to finish off I'm going to
use some of the weight texturizing spray
that stuff's amazing just for adding a
little bit more texture to here is a lot
bit more boards and then I'm going to
use my air factor it by PG true lasting
color serum that stuff smells amazing
again I bought this at my hairdresser
I'm just taking one little pump warming
up in my
and they were just going to really
quickly just run my fingers through my
order here at the top and ends of my
expansions and I just add a little bit
more in a luster to the year and that
you guys hope I turned my dirty bun here
into somewhat presentable glamazon here
it just got really needs to leave before
we do for someone who can't live through
here it's so easy and it makes music ten
times more presentable for actually well
it looks like it's so still a body it's
super secular can absolutely love it
I chose the afraid only renewal rate the

different course for you guys or if you
