did excited I just received the his
ability foundation and a PR package in
the post and I've been really excited to
try this I've seen a lot of people
raving about it I've not actually seen
any negative reviews but then again I'm
not seeing that many reviews I'm not
really sad and watch them because I just
wanted to have my own experience so I
show you guys my feel scam routine my
eye makeup is also going to be in
another tutorial if you guys are
interested but if you'd like to see my
review first impressions and thoughts on
the hood of beauty foundation then
please keep watching ok I'm really
excited I'm really really excited about
this I have already prepared my skin so
I'm just going to tell you what I use I
use the Chi press antioxidant you first
and I just put four drops of that all
over my face then I use the Chi press
Helio tropic this is a primer under
sunscreen so I use this every single day
even though I love somewhere where the
Sun does not exist I still use it then I
use my daily reviving concentrate by
Kiehl's I just put a bit 4 drops of that
on my skin to make sure that it's super
luminous and I like a dewy finish as
well so I always did that before
foundation and then I've been really
good using my youth on coconut tanning
spray I use this every single day and
that is how I have a tan on my face
because obviously I use sunscreen and I
wear makeup everyday my face doesn't
really get that tan so when I use this
it gives me a really nice natural glow
it matches my body as well because this
is my real color at the moment so I've
just sprayed a coconut water on my face
and then at nighttime I spray it again
but I'll also spray it on my chest and
stuff and that's what gives me a nice
bronze glow so I'm really excited about
this it's got a lot of really good
feedback I haven't really used it yeah
I've not used that muscle see enemy but
I have tried the brush and I tried a
little swatch to see what the color was
like and it does look really good so the
colors I've got our butter pecan and
tres leches so these are both and the
medium skin tone
I actually think I'm going to use the
more yellow bass one will see though but
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get this primer this is the
complexion perfection framer so this is
something that who does grow I'm gonna
take one pump of that on the back of my
hand it's pretty thick let's just try it
oh okay I like that I like the
consistency of it I think I've mentioned
on here before that I don't really like
anything to slay dig on my skin but that
feels nice and thick and nourishing I
think it does see it's a moisturizing
mica beets which suits me so I'm just
rubbing that all over yeah feels good
that feels really nice hydrating okay
let's try the shade Cheers
riches yeah it should be fine actually
I'm gonna take two pumps about in the
back of my hand so I'm gonna do my usual
I'm gonna dort it all over I don't wanna
sit sick but it's definitely a sucker
creamy foundation but I've seen amazing
reviews for this and I've got a lot
better redness on my forehead so we'll
see if that covers that up so that's me
use most of the two pumps I've got a
little bit left in the back of my hand
and I'm going to use the huzzah three of
t seis buffing blame brush this is the
brush that comes with that can a skin
collection that she's brought let's try
this feels good it feels great tacky
like definitely thicker foundation and
I'm gonna go over my lips like usual the
reason I do that is because I have such
a high color and my lips that I don't
like I like to have a really nude lip if
you have watched my channel for a while
you'll know that nude lip is my fave
Wow yeah that color blends nicely into
my neck compared to my shoulder it's
maybe a teeny bit late but I'm not going
any bronze
yeah that's nice so I've used the brush
to apply it I really do like it I just
saw in the bathroom mirror it does look
quite late yellow on me maybe I'm a
little bit more of a kind of Mexican
torn but this sponge I'm gonna use it
look at the size of this this is the
Elsie velvet sponge it's a new sponge
and I like it man it's huge so I'm just
gonna use the big end the big fat but
just to push that in a little bit more
yep yep I'm very excited
so the concealer I'm gonna use is my
usual heart-shaped tape I'm going to use
the shades light/medium and I'm just
gonna put that much under my eyes
nothing too crazy a little bit on my let
my nose and my forehead those
foundations Matt isn't that it's really
my high coverage cream foundation it
doesn't really see the finish but
considering I used all my oils like
usual I usually have more of a kind of
glow to my skin but I don't mind that
remember this fancy Beauty I was like
really shocked how much I loved the
matte finish so I'm just gonna use this
sponge it's got a really good nice
little point Wow that sponge is great
for getting right in
like your nose and stuff like that I
look really light under the eyes maybe I
should have used a slightly darker
concealer I don't actually quite like it
as very then is the gum so what I'm
gonna deny I'm gonna just go ahead and
finish my skin that we are usually would
so the way I do that is I'm gonna take
my Mac bronzer and give me some and nice
mess one one eight brush and we're just
gonna bronze up and see because I don't
usually powder my skin so we'll see how
bronzer goes on top what's going on
really smoothly I'm gonna go in with my
morphe M photo to brush this is like a
bronzer brush that everybody uses with a
little bit more bronzer I'm just gonna
put it on a little bit more buffed out
just because the other brush I use is
it's probably
for continent to be honest but I do like
her severe bronze so those foundations
called the full filter foundation I can
totally see why and do look like I've
got a feller on my skin
I'm gonna use a little bit less bronzer
just NSA to my nose and then if you feel
like you've gone a little bit too much
with a bronze just pass it back a little
bit now you guys know I don't tend to
use blush that much but I'm gonna go in
with obtain a little bit of the
California blusher by benefit which is a
really nice kind of quarterly shade I
don't really use blush that much but I
was going to throw my makeup and I find
that's an actually really - like this
the blush so I'm just gonna get me touch
that and just go above the bronzer
oh my god this is great
I have to think I really like this
foundation okay I mean to highlight I'm
gonna use the Laura Geller gilded honey
highlighter I've been really liking this
lately I'm gonna use the 134 luxe powder
fusion brush by Saliba this is a really
good highlighting brush highly our
cheekbones and then I like to highlight
just above my brow these days just like
here especially when I'm wearing a matte
foundation I just think it adds a nice
glow and again if you want to just make
it a little bit more subtle you just
going with your blender and then let's
highlight my nose I sweat pen love it so
I'm gonna go and with a wee bit more
bronzer on my cheeks I use a lot of
bronzer public service announcement I've
got a little corner here that would like
to use so this is my Bahama Mama bronzer
but I just think this is a really good
sheet for contouring so I'm gonna go in
with my little Smith 1:1 tube brush and
I'm just going to define my contour a
little bit more making sure that winters
high up and off because when you bring a
quarter down to the low that's when it
can can I drop your whole face I
absolutely love the way that was looking
the only thing that I don't like right
now is my
under eyes they look far too late so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set my
under eyes with my plate oh so this is
my fancy beauty universal pose I
absolutely love that stuff it's amazing
and I'm gonna buff that under my eyes
even that's a bit better by the usual
places so I'm gonna give you a close-up
look of what it's looking like right now
I think it's looking really nice it is
really mad but maybe with a little spray
of something I really like it I'm quite
confused at how matters it was no one
expected at all but it does look pretty
good and it mattered this is a really
nice color for me so that is the shade
320g translators and I'm sure the G will
stand for golden and I know that that's
the medium skin tone and you get 35 ml
in the tube I always say I got sent this
for PR so I'll need to check the place
but unless it down below and I know that
quite a lot because I sell and I'm sure
it's a beauty beauty anyway all that
information will be down below but what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna shoot off
I'm actually filming another video today
on some exciting eyes shadows so I'm
gonna go and I'm gonna film that but do
it and I'll come back with an update on
the foundation when my whole other race
my makeup is finished and I'll let you
know my thoughts until I can explain my
face or something
I'm gonna use my Urban Decay all nighter
spray just to get a little bit a liquid
on my face because it does feel it
doesn't feel that heavy it feels more
Mac that I'm used to I'm used to my
foundation being like slippy you know
but that's it doesn't feel like it's
going anywhere so I'm gonna give my face
a little spray see that feels better to
me okay
I'm gonna shoot off and I'll be back to
let you know my thoughts okay guys so I
have been away I have finished my eye
makeup I just found another tutorial
using the bleach london eye shadows
which will be out soon and
I put lipstick on and put my brows on as
well and it's been about two and a half
hours since I applied the foundation I
love it I think it's really really good
it's definitely more mad than what I'm
used to
I skin type wise I'm really lucky I've
got pretty easy skin my pores aren't too
big I don't have too much bleed like too
many blemishes and things like that
my skin is relatively smooth I think I
would definitely need to use an oil
under this foundation obviously all the
skin cured I use beforehand it spray
hydrating and I still feel like it's
super matte so I think you need a pretty
wicked moisturizer underneath it I would
be a little bit apprehensive if you have
very dry skin if there's any kind of
flaky because I think that this
foundation could me be sure the
flakiness off a little bit if you've got
really oily skin I think that this
foundation make the amazing obviously
because it's super mattify and I think I
have kind of combination oily skin
basically what I think is if your skin
care is good and you're looking after
your skin and you don't have too much
kind of flakiness and things like that
they don't think you're gonna love this
foundation the coverage is a means that
is super fill coverage I'm trying to
think of something that I think is
similar to it and a really kind other
than maybe double weird but it's a
really different texture to double where
it's more like a sticky jail who does
double wear is literally like a liquid
and in a dry zone matte and then it will
come off that still feels like it's got
a lot about tackiness - it's a little
bit more comfortable it's actually it's
a lot more comfortable to wear than
double wear for sure but the coverage is
brilliant my powders went on really
smoothly highlight went on like a dream
I really really liked it so I hope you
guys find this useful I know that
cochlea the woman if you order a certain
amount of products or a certain amount
of money's worth you get a sample of the
huda beauty foundation so that's
something to think about the moment I
don't really know where it's been sold I
think you might be able to go into
Selfridges it's definitely not the
easiest foundation to go and get a
swatch over unless it's in Sephora I'm
not sure if as in the UK it's pretty
difficult so it may be worthwhile trying
to source a sample from Colby
or something like that well a waiter
again functional I really am excited to
try it with a few different techniques I
may try using a sponge to sponge it all
over
well done who the beauty thank you so
much for saying to me so you guys I hope
you're late for a little review and
other than that I will see you in the
next video bye
hey guys really really quickly
I've never done this before it but it's
no 8 p.m. and I filmed this foundation
at 11 a.m. so this is a main our chicken
I have been touching my face all day
cleaning out sides just like day-to-day
life and I just wanted to see I'm super
impressed even more so now so I've
obviously I've gotten all that perfect
life that you my dinner and I lunch
since then as well I've not touched my
lips like up at all I'm not touched my
makeup all day I literally finished it
took pictures and then just got a room
ID but I'm not high chance take off this
