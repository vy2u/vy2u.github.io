we are going to do if PR unboxing home
so I've seen these all over YouTube for
a long time and honestly the reason that
I've never done one is because I get far
too excited when I get PR that I open it
straight away and I've never left with
enough to hold really I really struggle
to hold on to things it's like it's like
a present you know say Christmas is
already been you've got that one present
just sitting there you want to open it
so you're gonna open it run yeah me and
Jack Jack and I have just been a way to
New York and Toronto if you guys watch
our weekly vlogs you'll know exactly
what we've been up to but I just got
home yesterday I'm feeling a little bit
worse for wear I am a little bit worse
for wear I've lost these two guys
because they're my most used fingers
I'm joking it was a suitcase accident so
yeah I'm a mess I just got out this
morning I saved my life got up Pera
through the jetlag put a lot makeup on
and turn my camera on what we're gonna
do is unbox all this fun stuff so if you
don't know who I am
or I don't know what I do I am Jamie
Genevieve I am a youtuber I make makeup
videos mostly but we also weekly vlog
and that is pretty much how I have all
that stuff behind me I'm sure you guys
know I know youtubers get sent free
stuff in the hopes that we will like the
product can talk about it so I think I
know most of the brands that are here I
think this is most I think I'm on the
mailing list for most of these brands
anyway so let's just get started I don't
know this one actually have a really fun
little gadget that's right here benefit
sent me a little while ago ha parcel
opener is actually really handy so this
is from the brand de corte you can get
it in Selfridges so this is I guess
exclusive to Selfridge as you can see
here and the first thing that I'm readin
is
and glue do do me please find enclosed
samples of the brand-new makeup
collection from dead quality decorative
or I hope I've seen that rate available
no it's the overages I glow Jim package
ins nice creat subtle and then a couple
of lipsticks I think this stuff's really
posh there's a lipstick here too but I'm
not gonna swatch it because I know
already looking at this color I would
never wear that so what I do in that
case is I put it back in a tube and I
put it to the side for getaways and give
to friends and family and stuff like
that that's like another cream eyeshadow
again I'm annoyed that I've swatch the
other one because you guys know me I
never really used cream eyeshadows so
I'll have give them away there's one
more color lipstick oh this is my color
I can wear this nice nice pigment smells
nice it smells posh next a gold pocket
so I accidentally opened this already
and I'm so excited a brand new sheet
mask from Kiehl's that says the instant
renewal concentrate mask with a blade of
cool pressed and Amazonian oils and it
comes in two parts top and bottom I
cannot wait to use this me and jacquard
on another long flight on Monday so I'm
going to use this while I'm on that
flight so when you get PR saying you
always get kind of information booklet
so for four of these it costs forty-four
pounds so there are 11 pounds each which
is actually not as bad as I thought it
was gonna be because I know that
Charlotte tell everyone to think they
come in at like I'll be like more than
that so that's fine I stock up on either
already know I'm gonna love it
thank you I have one year from Tarte
poor are you up to those hearts when
some of the details should enjoy cardial
photography art books is everything
there
really funny sculpting and shading are
my cardio honestly I don't know how
you've got the time and effort to be
packaged and everything like this so in
the front that says part double duty
Beauty sculpting and cheating are my
Kajal and an N say we've got three of
these little brushes detailer brushes
I've never seen any like that they're
later than I thought it would be and
honestly I don't actually use brushes
like this for my eyeballs but there's a
nice little unit could be good for cut
creases or not contouring there is a
shape tape I'd framer which I'm quite
excited with so you guys know that I
either use sheet tape or lens with pimp
or to train my eyes so that one hasn't
got that much coverage I will definitely
be trying it out and then sheep your
moneymaker
eyes and cheeks palette really nice warm
tones you've got their foiled shadows
right Maricruz you look let's put it on
top of the Oh see that jeez Louise this
is the high layer here pretty rosy for
me I think I'd probably just stick to
using that on my apart from that looks
like an amazing color color I just want
a big contour shade from Tarte that's
why I really am one and thank you tart
this is a bit heavy so excited this is
hair they look spring 2018 from Natasha
de Nonna I need to get more of that for
in addition remember I loved it so much
so any here we've got diamond and blush
two of them and then up here is a really
beautiful visual I'm very cool lady
I wonder if related so we've got color
number one which is Daria row they cream
oh they are Wow we that's exciting
we've got some pretty bright looking
blushes so these are the cream base you
do that first and then you put your
powders on top on these egg haha no I'm
upset that I've put my makeup on already
I'm just going to chuck some of this
diamond powder on top well I cannot wait
to slip and use this tomorrow
this one's called number26
look at this crazy character what are
you doing in there buddy okay I think
I've got too much highlight or not no if
there's such a thing I think this is one
of those highlighters it's just got like
a huge it portrays in color so there it
is there let me just watch it here okay
yeah okay
and it's quite different that is the
weight is looking highlight oh wow
interesting dual chrome top coat you see
that that's like lightly key and then
when you start rubbing it on it just
cool is like a proper fading clef time
I'll do it on the palm of my hand so you
can see sex steps if you want so you do
cream blush first powder blush for a Jew
French add the face glow cream shimmers
as a base for then the extreme cool
finish the Duke will finish and then the
sparkling diamond like finish if you
guys want me to do a video on that I
totally will because it looks dope Thank
You Natasha okay I've got another one
from time here and I just once again
opened cause we all know what it is and
I need to see this in real life for
myself I don't know if I'm gonna do it
but you want it to be honest you guys
cuz I think everyone else has probably
said but I would have to see as well but
if you guys want me to see it anyway I
can pop another shape tape foundation
I'm not gonna lie looking at this
picture next to my face I look darker
than all those foundation but let's have
a look
got my foundation we've got a hydrating
foundation a new sponge
I like the first heart sponge David so
that could be cool a paddle brush which
is $28 the foundations are $39 which I
think that translates to by 33 pounds or
something which is a cheap foundation
isn't one size fits all so this is how
the PR package came and then you open it
up and we've got the foundation we've
got some new shapes thank God I was
gonna name that brush feels nice too
it feels like my iconic London ones the
sponge feels good I'm excited to try
that or actually let's see what colors
do save me
 they're actually sent in the rate
sheets as well so I right now I'm using
medium and I don't have any feet tan on
so I can probably use darker but I've
got light light medium and medium here
okay foundation light medium honey this
is the hydrating one quick pinky medium
neutral yeah that's fine actually that's
not bad but that's the darkest when they
said it was medium neutral so I'll only
really be able to use it on this color I
don't know if you can see that on camera
but that's the color go saying of the
matte one and it's quit late I can
darken up so dynamically and I'm gonna
try these my friends will be absolutely
buzzing because I've got four shades
here that are too late for me and they
oh they will be too late for me forever
so I'll have them to give away medium
neutral seems to be the color that I am
I think I was usually tense and let me
know if you want me to do a video on
these guys thank you very much tart

because it's my first PR from these
people
NARS curl this like how open it look
this is the biggest book look at that
look what they're showing off look at
that shade range I'm am Neimark she's a
youtuber here on YouTube and she has the
most beautiful really like dark skin and
she does a youtube series called darkest
shade because she can never frame a
foundation it's
and I saw she had just done a lot of
work with NARS and the darker shade of
their foundation was too dark for her so
that's really exciting
I bought this foundation already their
granite have so many colors in Sephora
and this color that I bought is just a
little bit too dark it's too yellow for
me I can mix it with stuff it looks good
but obviously I want to do that oh my
god
look at this that's just like saying
look at those tones what's stunning look
at that so I've got three filled size
sheets and then I've got all of them to
try oh my god let's see what she's this
and I know this is great news they've
sent me three shades they'd save me one
layer than the one I bought for that
looks like it's gonna be too late
this is the I bought which is
called Stromboli this is the shade style
Berg I think I can mix these two
together and give you guys a review
because the one that I bought everyone
would just see your fingers used to turn
and then they even sent me a darker one
really good shade matching nose very
good shade matching I'm gonna take the
darker one with me when I go or in the
holiday because that'll be like the most
beautiful golden shades for when I've
got time so what I use of this
foundation so far so nice like really

little bit shiny on me
but I obviously never use powder so I
can definitely change that so excited
