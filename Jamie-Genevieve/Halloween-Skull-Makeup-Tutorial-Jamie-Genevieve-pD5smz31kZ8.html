to show you how to do this skull
makeover so on my Instagram have been
decreasing click to start YouTube and
and when I asked what can looks at your
fancy this was the most requested so I
thought why not give it go but I have no
idea what I'm doing I've never entered
anything entire life I have no idea how
you work YouTube so will be with me and
hope it's not too bad but here we go so
I'm just going to start I have a
completely bare face there's no makeup
on my skin at all I use this guy named
iti water just to take all makeup off
and I'm going to start off with a primer
I'm going to use the matte feel which is
a completely mattifying plane where it's
just going to prepare my skin for makeup
and on mattified you come down and just
make everything last a lot longer
so start off with that I'm just going to
use a foundation brush and we'll pop
that all over my face concentrate mostly
on the t-zone because that's what I
myself get quite oily grab it and just
let that sink in for a bit and I'm going
to go in with my foundation as a base
first so I've got my color which is skin
beads and number 10 see people do this
before and I've got scam base and zero
one which is pretty much just wait I'm
going to Mexico together and just put it
all over
now that I've got my base I'm going to
outline all the ideas and gonna color it
in black so start off with ice okay and
the collage you're using a white pencil
it's really easily rubbed out raised and
you can just paint right over it and
won't be able to see your outline
I like making mine look quite uneven
just like a real ice wall hit with I'm
going to do your nose so it's like a
little triangle on each side and you can
make a double triangle if you like but
if you're doing the whole face like
wouldn't Lee I would just did it time on
each side
against it's very thin but we're going
to go over that enemy and the Pens I
used was tough white pencil FBI pencil
by Illamasqua and it's called a leap
know to go onto the cheeks so I'm going
to change it with a black pencil I'm
sure everyone's got one anyway
and I'm going to do quite a weird shape
here it's like actually so start off
right in the drawing you can do this
quite high up
if you can imagine that's where your
teeth are gonna go so it's like that bet
your cheap ones coming over to whatever
and then the dark area you're going to
kind of color that whole section in but
mostly this that Canadia is the busy
really black bit then just do the same
another shape they go happy with that
that's really basically but I'm not
going to color it in black in any sort a
daughter like you
and also one way or ten parts so it's
just like that with semi circles just
two templates you can going to feel it
ya know
so this is what matters know that good
good and I'm just going to go ahead and
color this area in here and my eye
socket you can use anything Phillips and
you can use your painter I like using
joey-lynn it's quite scary to ignore
removed smoke in a budge and it's very
black so the one I'm using is the
Illamasqua and it'll mask a draft and I
just go all over the eye sockets and
just in whose wheel I don't sure it
you'll see me kind of blend it out
you
you
okay that is the two little big sex I
look out into new but you can see I've
discarded the ideas and you saw me drag
this jelly note down here is I'm going
to buff that and anything that's going
to be a real crash can according through
and now I'm going to go in with about a
detail so range your eyes obviously
these look just like star holes just now
all we have to do is put and a few
little bits of detail in a bit sure you
don't to make them move early flight so
again with Magellan now or you can use
your planes over there and just go in
here and create a little row board now
okay I blame him rush time she's an old
mask of Russia's city and they say the
blending brush and I'm just going it
also well I've got this I'm just gonna
buff that and are you bet
this gel liners out amazing because you
can kind of warm up and it will still
move again so you don't need to worry
too much about harsh lines or anything
and I'm going to go all right approach
other way to move
okay so I just cannot wait or my ice
I'll get some even more justly at it
anyway and make sure my eyebrows are
fully covered as well and not to worry
about crease and anything like that
because I've got black eyeshadow just
place on top and I'm going to go and
undo the teeth I think so why start off
with a plate foundation again fill up by
my right and then use a smoothing brush
by Illamasqua and I'm gonna do it alone
right on my move I've seen a lot of our
ecstasy only stick to this beg for your
teeth but I like it mainly on my face so
that's what I'm gonna do now in almost
looks ostrich I know when you've got
that I see your highlights on and stuff
it will look pretty good
I think and then I'm going to go in with
my liquid liner and this is o matic
again and it's a bet so it's really
really black and it's got a really faint
little tip so it's quite good for
precise detail and stuff and I'm going
to just born and I'm going to draw it to
smile lines right up to my jaw and just
be Erica Lane so this is quite like a
zombie skull you can meet your teeth as
realistic as one but I like to stand in
this for you because it always looks
good you don't need to worry about your
teeth looking too meaty so
so now I founded my vertical lines and
I'm just going to add tiny little V's on
the top of the tube just to give they
cannot affect the other board okay so
that is like the start of the teeth done
so it's a bit of a tb6
and now I'm going to do even more
shading and so we'll get your black
eyeshadow I'm using thirteen by
Illamasqua which is black is black eye
shadow as well which I love and vinegars
I try to brush and they pack on top of
my eyes first so just on top of the
socket that you've created pop that on
all over do much more intense outlook
wrap then when with your blending brush
again pick up some shadow we're just
gonna work on their job
because you've got your foundation boots
on it's much easier to blend Reno like
if you don't befriend each line dry skin
it just wouldn't look great so drag it
down I'm gonna come and see your teeth
Alec don't have actually move my teeth
as well so I'm going to one with a grey
eyeshadow called Incubus
let's kick in a little bit and like just
put in more to be better in my teeth now
all I love doing a reboot in the
forehead as well just requires is just
like it breaks alphabet no I'm going to
go in and put a little bit detail just
around all these parts with my black
paint sock sock or pencil again make
sure it's nice and sharp Israel because
otherwise we'll just live with silly
woman
I'm going to go under the eyes on top of
this we draw here and run the nose a bit
and then because it's cool pain so you
can just kind of leaned over bet just
gave you more dimension
then acting with my pencil I'm just
going to go around in high-level ideas
all right no I'm waiting because I've
got cat and it keeps on cleaning up me
like a tree and it's agony source or
what sort of a yellow in pain excuse me
I'm just going to take my black
eyeshadow again and blend of red and
we're going to fill in this area here
and blend that right in
all right you can do that style
agreement for a fake yeah I now to
highlight so we've won with my boyfriend
a che
I'm going to go in with my boyfriend
ation Screwjob white foundation and
rescreen highlight all the ears one
highlighted so I'm going to go in with a
smaller brush again just saw a clean
blending brush and I'm going to go in to
all the areas I want nice and like so
let's starting off with a jaw
perfect so I just went up the jar
cheekbones and forehead and I'm going to
just go up my eye socket actually and
then we're working teeth a little bit so
the product I use for those is scrape
and just like a black lick blown up but
pure great and it cleans and it's so
good really really great as well so if I
was going to meetings in the teeth it'll
make them stick out more like it's
upright sort of looks even stronger
nothing so big it just makes it so much
great I and them stick out so much more
so if you don't have a liquid liner at
home you can use a white eyeshadow or
even order the vacation and just step up
on the Makri a big difference in super
follow me looking getting the over
getting here now for the actual jaw and
neck so how I do this and you get my gel
liner again deaf in my blood I just draw
a new join so I usually extend that over
make somewhat put your own food
now for the neck I do this really easy
almost Chi so what I do is I get my
jelly in a brush that's got excess on it
and I'll just draw sweeping lines right
up my neck and another cheese wheel and
then put for you in the middle so sure
so we've done the basics I'm just going
to go in at a little more detail and
then fabulous
so there was just a lot more blame then
added two little cracks
that's my what my my I and we added a
few retracts on my China actually so
this is where I shouldn't do each of
them to it and decease it so that is how
I made look so hopefully you like that
and I am I think I stayed easy it's
really good one for Halloween or even if
you just like gonna miss a bit weaker
fade away so when I all you do now
so all I've done now is added a Peter
lashes on these are my lash lashes from
Illamasqua absolute favorites Halloween
or not and a little bit pigment as well
which is android by Illamasqua which is
just a really beautiful canna sparkly
pigment they looked amazing on black so
I really hope you liked the video I hope
you learned something and I'm even to do
it maybe like one video a week just know
to see your bedroom and see how it goes
obviously but you can subscribe you can
like comment whatever
I'll put our product like stone below
Israel just everything I used it's not
that much stuff either most of it you
