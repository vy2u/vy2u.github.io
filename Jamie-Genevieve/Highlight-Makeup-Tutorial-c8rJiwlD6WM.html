own high light
hi guys welcome back to my channel I am
made here today and we're gonna do a
highlight tutorial
long-awaited I know but I'm really
really excited to bring you this
tutorial it's basically how I created my
whole entire skin look and I'm going to
pop on this lipstick at the end as well
what my plan is is to get this red you
work for you guys and then I'm going to
bring a nighttime look I maintain skin
look and then I'm going to bring our
barely-there makeup look and witches are
actually super popular I hope you like
us highlight tutorial and I hope you tag
me and all your little global baby
selfies and if you'd like to see how I
create this look stitching okay so first
thing to F here's dying is get it out of
the way good I actually brushed my hair
to Z okay that'll do okay so a couple of
things I thought already that I think
are really important when you're 1 in to
achieve a pretty spectacular skin look
is look after your skin I am if you'd
like me to do a full skincare video let
me know down below I'll tell you two
things right now that I'm using I think
are actually making a big difference and
the first thing is nothing fab a
glycolic daily peel cleansing pads
I call it fix daily cleansing pads in
you get 60 pads at our tub I think I got
these for orchid remember but I remember
it was like 1/3 off so I think it
brought it down to make 6 pounds and
main pains or something so it's not
expensive skin care but in my skin is so
much softer there any kind sports and
things like that feel like they're
coming to the surface quicker and and
due to that I actually don't have as
many sports so I'm really liking these
fan and another thing that I've used
ivory bought this three times now as the
ball betrayed that men invited fear
space
and this stuff is just a good bro it
smells like heaven and I'm poor I just
think this stuff is so nice I'm gonna
hit Remo it hydrates your skin
it's got sheer butter vitamin C and E is
well so it's just really good for your
skin and it's probably one of the only
products for Bob's drayan that I really
love man okay let's get into doing that
so first I'm going to use as a clean
slate tainless primer from Tarte and
I've been using this quite a bit it's
really important to have a super
flawless base with this makeup so I'm
just using that if we don't pulley so
I'm going to use up my chin rate my nose
the kind of metal in my face as well and
then I'm gonna use on my forehead too
and it's crazy it just totally takes
away the appearance of any kind of deep
rapport or shininess that you don't want
obviously we're going to put shininess
back on our skin but oh it's just
absolute amazing it smelled incredible
so ladies I am and yeah it's just like a
really nice smooth and primer and I've
noticed as well my weight my makeup
stays on a lot longer and I've got this
one
nice I will use as my foundation some
will go straight in and I'm going to mix
two together both of these foundations
I've used by themselves and I really
really like just now I am a funny color
because I've not put any tan on but it's
still gonna come at all and I'm still
kind of round of Thailand so these two
colors makes videos really nice for me
to show you and the first one is the YSL
Touche claw and BD 60 which is a little
bit dark for me and the Marc Jacobs and
very remarkable foundation in B's late
which is a bit too late for me so I'm
going to make these two together and I'm
going to take one two pumps of the YSL
and then I'm going to just take a little
bit earlier one so that's the ratios
because they're remarkable foundation
Marc Jacobs is so thick and I don't use
as much in
that the YSL Touche Claire Foundation
does actually have really good coverage
name is changed formula basalt if you
use this a little while ago and you
don't like it neither did I but this
change the formula and it's so much
better it's really lovely so I'm going
to expose to the back of my hands within
my Smith one one five brush and I'm just
going to use that I'm just gonna kind of
dab it on all over and like I said this
is just like my everyday routine
so I'll just wake up put makeup on and
go out the door this is exactly what I
do and I'll probably do another video if
I was going out to show you how in my
makeup airs but this is everyday for me
obviously it to you guys some some of
you may like to wear this out I probably
would as well that's I'm good it we
could finish it okay so once I've can I
step with that oil I'm just going to use
always taking this brush that I'm gonna
use little circle motions just to blend
that don't mind a couple but when I hate
the hair color my lips and I'm not
coming too far up underneath my eyes I'm
going to use concealer there so those
two foundations mixed together it gives
a really nice satiny finish and it is
probably full coverage maybe medium to
fill depending on how much you put on
that's not too much variation for me at
all I have been known to be or more so
look it just covers everything nice
color for me it matches nicely and also
close Mexico because everything's kind
of yield to a foundation which is what I
like next I'm going to use is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer and custard and
I'm just going to use this underneath my
eyes this was one of those Troy looks to
me that so many people were using that I
didn't get it I don't know if you guys
do that but in everyone was raving about
it I was like I'm just going to leave it
everyone like I do I can't be bothered
finally go ahead I think it's because
now I just going hard to get I'm here in
Scotland you can only really get it from
spacing key moments be sinking in a
quartet and it's pretty pretty good yeah
pretty amazing so I just put lines I
believe my eyes and I'm just going to
buff that and what's a foundation brush
oh it's just it left so much it's crazy
it's so good
now if you wanted extra coverage you
could use that concealer down the center
of the face like growing the nose and
things like that I'm okay just now
quickly going to pay dirt underneath my
eyes first and foremost with mac
accentuate this is one of the shipping
photos if you ever come to makeup done
by knee or had a lesson or watch any of
my videos you'll know that I really like
this it's just a really nice left in
powder this say it's everything
underneath your eyes and it's ever so
slightly luminous so seeing photos and
things like that I just make sure I
don't I looks like so good and because
it's pressed you can get right and with
your brush and just using as a we've our
face focused brush and placed you can I
really pack that on underneath the eyes
I'm being quite careful just to use that
underneath I sort and then I'm going to
take a little bit and just go over my
smile lines and in between my eyebrows
next thing is highlight let's do this so
I'm going to grab my fan brush I used to
use a Smashbox Wynette now I'm using as
a weaver one and this is from the rules
golden collection the iron was beautiful
rose gold brushes everywhere so this is
just the lux fan brush any fan brush
will do I really think so I can use any
brush to do my highlight but I did
prefer a fan brush and highly I believe
today as my their car opal so this is by
far my favorite color
from Becca opal is just so stunning and
if you are a bit theatre I would go for
minstrel I'm sure it's called and but
opal for any I would probably use this
on the majority of skin tones and the
reason I'm going to do this first I will
explain later but what we're going to do
is we're going to get a fan brush and I
pack up a decent amount of product on
the fan brush and I'm just going to go
right over the high point of my cheek
and I'm rubbing it into my face I'm not
piling and literally I'm being quite
firm with my brush as well and one of
the most important things about
highlight and if you want it to be as
bold as mine is that you did not posy
your face first what you want is your
foundation to be quite gooey clay
and then the highlight completely sticks
to it and quail before my pages are fees
first and then try highlight and quail
people might use a mattifying foundation
for example studio effects are double
where I don't think are the base from
underneath a highlight and that's why I
like to use kind of more creamier
foundations so it's difficult choice now
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back
up with a powder brush it used under my
eyes get that highlighter and will it
bring it above my brow onto my ten pile
I know what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go on my Cupid's bow may tap of my
nose and just a little later can it
connect eight exclamation mark so I'm
just going to doing the bridge of my
nose as well well you can do it I've
already highlighted my below but if you
wanted you could go back in with your
highlighter and hey like your actual pro
as well and sometimes I'll put just a
little bit on my chin just to make my
skin that luminous and maybe dust the
excess to my fan brush just or my jaw as
well and I think the fan brush is really
important and I thank the fact that your
foundation is way it's really important
and the fact that I'm pushing it into my
skin in trade firm is important because
that means it's going to last all day
their next step to my skin is just
bronze egg so the reason I highlight
first before I blonde and I'm gonna use
my bronzer to contour as well it's
because I've got my highlight on my
cheekbones already when I go to bronze
I'm going to bring it down my cheek born
in the hollow of my cheek bone and then
when I start to blend upwards a little
bit the highlighter
olmecs with the bronzer and it just it
gives a really nice transition so I'm
just going to use my smooth one one
eight brush and my steel our steel D
light bronzer I'm just going to go all
my cheap wood
so it is important to start in the back
of the year and go downwards and then
once you've got your nice line you can
kind of use circular motions just to
move it upwards towards the high part of
your cheekbone I'm going to go do my job
and then I like to use a little bit on
my forehead just to warm the potato up
and instead of going to feel most
contour what I like to do is you scare
the sight of our brush get a little bit
of bronzer and just bring it down to say
to my knowledge like that
well sometimes I get emotional at Haley
or how good it can be healthy okay and
know why let's do it is grab a blush out
this is my favorite blusher right now it
is peaceful up by tart and you'll
actually just need to go like that one
tiny bit use my powder brush and I'm
just going to put a tiny bit and between
my highlight and contour just like that
adds the haenyeo set of color but it
just looks a little late I am along with
it today as I'm going to use a liquid
lipstick this is one of my new favorite
brands this is the your liquid lipsticks
you can get them from cold Beauty and
they're quite new they're made in Italy
but they're like French theme - this
one's called pitch I'm going to line my
lips first with a slick stick from
Illamasqua these are quite news well
this one is and she'd dream that the
cause as a dream is most beautiful nude
lip liner ever and it does not move they
are a little bit play see at 18 pounds
but because edog moving into interview
apply I thought were worth it so I'm
just going to go around my lips just now
okay so once you've learned your let go
it up together just because that does
help a little bit with cleansing the lip
we know now when we're going with the
Shuar liquid lipstick in a pitch which
is
stageful peach and it's going to pop
that on okay now I'm going to do that
would it take a tiny little bit of my
favorite translucent powder this is
chanel Appu that are universal and I'm
going to use a tiny bit of that just at
the sides of my nose because that's
probably the place that I get really
oily I don't want to look like my
highlight is mixing with my oil and weed
a little bit much hit as well and
basically that just sets everything it
gets a really really nice kind of
luminous look and there's the finished
look you can if you want set this with a
setting spray I recommend the Urban
Decay steel NATO but I have ran out
please go shopping so guys that is the
finished look I hope you like that and I
feel like I'm like a cat out the bag I
feel like before them I highlight carry
the bag that says honestly the burka hey
leo has to be one of my all-time
favorite hey Leo's I cannot believe the
way it goes most on my skin it's just so
much better than anything else of yours
obviously I still really do like the
soft and gentle I love that Anastasio
gorgets as well in what I'll do is I'll
link everything of yours down below as
per usual but what I'll do is I'll add
the other highlighters that I really
like as well and you can go and have a
look at them and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to do other and cure videos
and show you different layers so you can
see but this is probably my all-time
favorite is the shadiest and yeah it's
probably the one I get asked what I'm
meaning when I'm reading it I hope you
liked this tutorial and I'll be back
soon with another one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
