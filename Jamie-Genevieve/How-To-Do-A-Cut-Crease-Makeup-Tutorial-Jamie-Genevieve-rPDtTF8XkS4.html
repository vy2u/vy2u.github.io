hi guys welcome back to my channel I
moved house this is my new flat this is
it's complete working progress I managed
to meet this area with some pretty
lights and my usual things well I am so
excited to get any mootness please and
change up so I don't know if you'd be
interested in seeing it if you want if
you want to fly to our I will up do that
for you
I don't know what makeup related but I'm
very noisy and I like seeing people live
like see I play my favourite youtuber
change room and I'm like Nicole that's
what catching but that's where she makes
her food so if you want to see what this
spot looks like right now we can go flat
to it and then I'd love to keep you
updated on what kind of things I do is
that anyway
makeup time what I'm going to do today
is I'm gonna show you how to do this
country sticks what is clay our eyebrows
it's quite soft cut Keith maybe it has
leave a dry cleaning but for me this is
so in my last party tutorial was sold
aim and that crap quit bad actually
that's a - to start making YouTube plain
you're still learning so I'm sure I'll
look back on this one in a couple of
months ago I little bit that other than
today so I'll show you how to do this I
am using very exciting new floor tiles I
was saying that it's just the day before
the moves how the various trains ever
this is there's a weaver smoky palette
and a so this hang is so beautiful the
colors are absolutely gorgeous I only
use
one two three four of the colors and s
look obviously I went for kind of blown
news but in the Pegman amazing the
colors like they're all matte apart from
to shimmer which is what I won I don't
know come on man hey Matt blendable
shadows yeah with that and I use the wax
brush a to apply them
so um yep definitely won best brushes I
have absolutely lots of brushes so thank
you so much to leave her for these and I
hope you guys like the look actually say
it's okay I hope I show you how to do
this really simple way because it isn't
difficult I can do it you can do it and
yeah thank you so much for tuning in
guys
so starting off with a little bit of the
capital corn scan enhancer and just an
elite dustin over the eyelids and a
little bit underneath the eye as we'll
be careful just use I'll tell you a
little bit this product so it doesn't
crease then I'm going in with LMS
carpenter and or no to sketch out the
crease so I've sharpen this pencil super
sharp and I'm going to use the pencil to
Ettore the cut crease this is how I
always start a nice streak and that's
quite solid in color as well makes a big
difference and then I'm going to go in
with my little pencil brush by Weaver
I'm just going to use that slightly it
turned up and I'm going to buff out the
top of the pencil so I'm leaving the
bottom line of the pencil quite sharp
because that's going to be the concrete
but the top you can blame Doug that's
what we're going to get our nice smoky
eye from so just can I soft gentle
wiggling movements or really hilt buff
that oh and the color of this pencil is
just beautiful the palette I'm using is
the smoky palette by his weave up which
is absolutely gorgeous and I'm just
using this nice topi shade as a
transition color and I'm just using this
Weaver blending brush and I'm buffing
that enter the pencil and towards the
brow then I go in with the lightest
shade in the palette this is I have no
idea what that's it and I'm just going
to pack that onto the lids to get it
nice and light making sure that I'm not
going on to the purple going in with the
nice dark brown shade in the palette I'm
going to darken the crease a little bit
and I'm constantly just blending up
towards the brow so you can get that
nice diffused smoke then going in with
my favorite gel liner that Ella masks a
precision ink I'm going to get beautiful
flicks so I'm using this Weaver liner
brush for this starting off in the
middle of the lid just so my flicks are
nice and easy to achieve little bits at
a time is probably the best advice I
could go for
getting your flex rate and then I go in
and do my flick so just nice gentle
movements to get the end of the flick
nice and tea roads and then working back
on myself to get there can a triangle
shape that you want to go for and then
just fill in a tenet nice and black then
I'm going to use the gel liner and I'm
going to go end the waterline this is
perfectly safe and it actually lasts a
lot longer on the waterline than a
pencil and then I just buff a little bit
underneath the lash line as well
then I'm going to go in with the two
darkest shades in the palette and I'm
going to buff that underneath using the
brush that we used fresh the little
pencil brush and that gets it nice and
smoked Doh underneath going back in with
the latest cheat I'm going to use that
my inner eye and drag it down as well
going and with the two darkest shades
again I'm going to extend my lower lash
line this gives a really nice open look
to the eye in nice and structured as
well which is always nice and then going
back in with that pencil brush I'm gonna
buff the color down so it's not a solid
line nice and smoky going back in with
the two darker shades in the palette I'm
just going to darken my crease up one
last time
from starting from the liner and working
my way up towards the center a little
corner of your favorite mascara top and
bottom lash obviously and then to finish
the lick off I'm going to add a pair of
lashes these are their ill daughter be
106 mm-hmm
big smiles for you guys and then once
the glue is nice and tacky place your
lash on that is the finished book super
easy cut crease by a super dramatic as
well thank you guys so much for watching
see you next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
