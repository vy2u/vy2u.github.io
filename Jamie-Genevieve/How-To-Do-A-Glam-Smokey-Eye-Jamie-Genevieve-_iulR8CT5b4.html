back to my channel I am back this week
with a tutorial for you so I'm doing I
really can a glam I'm raising inspired
evening I look I'm using my makeup geek
shadows once again because I am really
struggling to find anything that I think
is good as as good so I'll like the
products down below that I'm using as
always and today is Thursday which means
it's my birthday

year but I think 22 I can see it in a
little bit they say so thank you so much

your support
and I hope you like this video and I'll
see you next week so starting off with
Elizabeth Arden eyelid primer my new
faith then going in with gorgeous
eyeshadow by makeup geek and I'm using
that over the whole crease I haven't
edited this part just to show you how
much product and blending goes into an
eye makeup so usually my videos are
really really short and snappy but
that's what I'm really showing you
exactly the process of how I create and
eye makeup then I'm going to wet Coco
bear shadow by makeup geek and I'm just
gonna intensify in the crease and i'm
also gonna carry that underneath the eye
as well just making it really nice and
can add smokey with brightens then
corrupt eyeshadow which is black and i'm
just intensifying that crease that
little bit more and again dragging the
product underneath as well i'm not too
worried about on the lead because i'm
gonna clean that up where their file
shadow making sure that the blacks nice
and strong as well and
swapping brushes to blame though and can
a police the product then I'm going in
with in the spotlight which is what if
the foiled eyeshadow always absolutely
loved the formula of these they are
super sparkly and I'm just packing out
one with an actual eyeshadow brush all
over the lid and on the inner corner
then I'm using infinity Jay Leno by
Illamasqua and I'm just creating Elaine
on top of the light on top of the LEDs
nor Fleck this time a nice rounded smoky
eye and I'm gonna pack on Lords a gel
liner and the water Elaine this is
completely safe I do that's quite a lot
and I just think it Isaac Whitney's
drama to the look very Emily's a having
black and your waterline and I'm just
bringing that to her point at my tear
duct as well add in a bit mascara as
always top and bottom as always add on a
lash do whatever you want make sure it's
tacky pop your lash on and that is
genuinely the quickest smoky eye ever
perfect for the night I thank you so
much for watching guys see you next week
