basically what happened was about four
hours ago I sat down and filmed a
tutorial I tried to assess palette and I
really struggled you can see it
individual itself you can see that I 2nd
of history as you can see that I'm
really struggling with it and I ended up
calling it quits I had no makeup on
apart from really crappy eye shadow and
I was late I am done in a piece though
on that video really quickly since
there's only been four hours
our last me and Jack ed as dividual we
put it up and as soon as I started
watching other YouTube tutorials using
the palette and I started getting pissed
off with myself because I gave then I
gave an alert palette beat me and I'm
just I'm just not that way from a strong
Scottish women it just was not for
happening so I was not going to Kim here
and I've been sitting for us for a fair
little whale practice and West's palate
trying out different techniques trying
out different arrows trying out
different methods different colors as
well I managed to create this eye so I
asked you guys on Twitter I said do you
want me to show you how I did it and you
suggest so I show you how to do this a I
actually really really do like the look
it's been a long time since I've done
that's been when don't smoke I used to
do it all the time so I do think as hot
fire I do really like it and range near
Madryn Judy's mallomars Cadiz so I do
absolutely love this eye makeup it was
not easy to create I had to use a few
techniques I would never ever ever use
using any other site I shadow palette
but it did seem to work for this palette
so I basically sat and troubleshooted
just worked out or way that this palette
would work for me and I'm going to show
you how I did it basically the reason I
wanted to do this was I felt really bad
there most people of course palette and
if you watch the last video then I can
totally see if I you'd be like how I'm
going to use it how am I even gonna cope
with it
so that's when I decided to sit down and
tie off area it was going to work for me
so I can show you guys because my job is
not to sit here and bash a product but
to sit here and teach you how to make
so I'm going to do that if you want to
see how actually a dislike and please
stay tuned I managed to do that let's
hope I can do it on the other eye let's
just go ahead and do it when I went away
and edited and put up the first tutorial
at least Lee got really annoyed I want
to try it again so I tried it with a few
different steps I ended up I think I
tied it really boot size times different
variations of plain rows and things like
that and I'm going to do what I've done
on their side because it seemed to work
basically I'm going to start with little
pin port again I'm just going to skip it
with my people and don't apply all of my
eye and then underneath as well and I'm
bringing the plane Mario because I ended
up when in a straddle rato as well I'm
just going to powder that same with my
Charlotte Oh bleep editor again so I
this is actually the same stats of last
time I just applied them in a different
way and I totally stayed away from the
transition shades because it just did
not work for me so I'm going to really
powder that down subculture part to do
this is on a pallet looks like and I've
used it quite a few times I don't
actually think that the follows that bad
and I don't really talk about it in my
last video I definitely know what's it
about this I create a fair amount in
there but whatever so let me just
remember her at this time gonna do it
again the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to take the shades old star
and I'm just going to pack on in a
v-shape and I'm not worried about it
getting it down here because I use the
white to clean up and not seem to work
really well so I'm just using a zoeva
two three one brush and I'm just parting
it on and then I'm just going to use the
saving of dust to drag that out a little
bit I just went in with my Smith
247 brush which is also quite fun and
I'm just going to go backwards and
forwards and start to really wring that
out so this is really weird for me
because I was never born with a shades
of dark by itself but I just tried to
and it seemed to work a lot better never
really boyhood
method to see two brushes a bit fluffier
and the ship also again and I'm just
going to start really blended so you can
see that itself blend and not that bad
like but never ever would I going
without shade dark first but oil seems
to work and I'm just going to pick up
some of that shadow and I'm going to
make sure it's nice and pigment eggs
down here now remember this well paint
with my two to four easily the brush and
a shade roadie they're really dark
purple shoots and it's going to tap into
that shape and I'm going to start
packing that on in the crease and then
I'm going to swap over some other brush
what I need to and just blend billa's
tissues together
I'm going to go under my eyes really
because its connector when the off
balance clips or dark on top so I'm just
going to highlight underneath my eye and
then here there's a lot about my phone
so I'm just going to pack that on top
again
just pushing it on this time you see
what we know it's going on a lot better
and parking on the best idea now when I
was doing the other eye I then went into
the shade new leaves and I'm going to do
that again and I just really lightly use
that along the top near the gray ball
and just to help blend a little bit just
a tiny little bit over now I'm really
born with the shade Rohde again they're
really dark I'm going to make sure it's
really nice and pigmented so here it's a
lot but later oh hi
can we born with a more dense brush the
two four seven from Smith and really to
try and pack that on in crisis looking
quite messy but that's okay we can clean
all that up it's not looking bad now I'm
going to go in with the sheet adorned on
a brush note that brush this is a lock
pencil brush
and I'm just going to apply that all
over my lid I'm gonna try that says the
brush from the Naked heat palette and
I'm going to use that and I just apply
okay I'm gonna have to wait it I think I
put it all in fresh then wait and then
took mortal and talked so we're going to
try that I was going to wait at year's
end at the old mate Thursday that's
Andrew and then I brought that right in
to the inner corner I'm just going to
blend that back this way I feel like
it's got a little bit funny miracle no
I'm just going to take a little bit more
rosy and pack or never coroner I'm
wasting a little bit more all-star that
can a warm purple tone I don't think
that listened to me but I know the white
I used was de tart or so Kolya is these
pleasure eyes right from Tarte prefer a
little bit oily I'm going to use that
just with my nail and I'm just going to
try and clean this up today's clean line
okay I can see on the side the golden
all it hides I'm just going to fix that
quickly I'm going to try to find my
brush this is the Weaver two to six much
obliged it's what I usually use for the
cut please
I'm going to try so that seems to worsen
I really do think that's as good as I'm
gonna get I'm really happy though that
I've managed to get at lookin pigmented
and mostly blended I'm just going to add
some roller lash mascara by benefit and
then some fire lashes on top yeah
alright so this will play happiness up
not sad and cut trying to clean up the
style a bit more just a little bit too
good and then I think the sides a little
bit dark but actually so I'm going to
make that same on this side
I am going to go and do the rest of my
face and my brows and my lips and in a
money back and we have another little
chat a little chatter ooh a little chat
arena oh hey I did it
I managed to create a look which is
subculture pilot I'm going to make
badges for all so you can always
apparently the I managed
I managed and I'm going to zoom in and
have a closer look
so this is the loop that our monetary
actually really like it
I'm really glad that I tried again
basically with the color my final
thoughts in the pilot are still quite
similar to my last video the only reason
that basically of sat down and just
created a look I sat down and I just
tried over and over again until I find
something that works for me and this is
it obviously I could probably go ahead
and do a few licks of the palette now
but for me an eyeshadow palette that
cost that much money and also a brand
and already brought an amazing eyeshadow
palette that everybody loves
you shouldn't have to sit down and I
think I've been send every three hours
since its Prince my first video that I
appear already you guys have seen with
me really struggling
I found that both four and a half hours
ago and since then we went away uploaded
it and I came back here and sat and
practiced and practiced and really
played with the pilot until it's find a
way that I can make it work I don't
think that you should have to do that in
this image everyone knows what a good
eye shadow well these I don't know what
he'll really a feel really kind of funny
about it and I obviously I'm going to
create a look that I do really like so
in the pilot goods I don't know yes I
guess so but should I have to sit here
after being a makeup artist for this
long and set you for three hours to
figure that I don't know though it's a
Sunday today I've been playing a high
bar in the background because it's a
Sunday I should not be doing with but I
feel personally victimized by this
palette hand up if you feel like you've
been personally victimized
subculture anyway I am really happy with
this book I hope you guys like it yes
I'm really happy I sat down and I just
got it over system because I was not
great to be defeated by an eyeshadow
palette okay I'm stronger within the mat
I won I won as you like this look please
do it let me know down below if you want
me to try again with other colors living
all Donal hold it I'm happy I did it I
like the look I hope you guys into and
other than that I will see you in the
next video
let me do bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
