please be quiet
look back no way hi guys welcome back to
my Channel today I'm gonna do a whole
video on whore I purchased at IMATS so
fools who don't know I'm at as makeup
convention and that is held in London
New York Ellie and one other I think of
this I can't remember but I'm at the
London one at the weekends just there
and I went with loads of makeup artists
that I followed and we all got together
and rented an apartment in London for
the weekend and it was amazing it was so
much fun it was so nice to be around
like-minded people and just have a
really great time and just talk about
makeup from if I did so so IMAX there's
a lot of different stalls we were only
there for the Sundays I didn't get
around absolutely all of them but I did
get the ones that I really wanted to see
so starting off Mac there's a refuge Mac
Pro came out right in the middle and it
was nice and there were so many lovely
girls as well if I met here I'm at it
was lovely to meet ya thank you so much
for everyone that came up to me and said
that they liked my channel they liked
mensagam and things like that I've got
loads of selfies with people it was so
much fun it was so good so starting off
with Mac I got a few it I think I got
mostly pro things so production Mac
means that you can only get them from
the pro store so the only one in the UK
right now is I'm going to invite if
you're in a mackerel membrane you can
say no only you can order stuff online
as well which is cricket and so the
gloves I got where 3d pink
3d lavender and reflex gold the 3d
guitars are really quite course but they
are so beautiful they're so sparkly and
the reflex glitters are a little bit
finer and it's what I absolutely love
these threats I think that they're gonna
be really fun I'm more using
by well obviously I got two pallets so
these are inserts for the pallet so I've
got a blusher palette and I got the
lipstick why need are so popular because
you can virtually cook whatever you want
in this so I've always got really used
lipsticks it's just a really nice
compactly it's install your lipstick for
example if you have a kit
24 laps takes you can set in this so
much better than carrying about for
quick your lipsticks and ability and I
really like the blusher palace because
these actually fit our brands of blush
know so if you usually have to use a Z
palette with a brand then you're not too
fond of that you can get one of the
blush pens so love that I got leopard YZ
so luckily use as a throw that that's
basically something that just beside
your lips but this one's quite dark when
so I thought I could choose so some here
more times people but you could also use
it as a lipstick you could use it to
lighten up lipsticks as well as we've
got that the white crow line I bought
that before I asked anyone if it was
good and a few people said it's not very
good and I did get something else that's
really similar but I got this anyway and
I thought I could use it to lighten up
things a reversal we'll see how I get on
the fire cost a rich I pen so that's
rejected by Michelle it was one of the
girls that was my first who is actually
a trainer for Mac and the state's Ames
of cost Alicia it's just like a really
beautiful warm toned Brown so excited
about that I think I could say that I
work with methought that and another
girl it was my supposed amber demon we
actually taught class anaphase II which
is amazing she convinced me to get
feeling which is really really really
creamy and black so if you like that
kind of smoked out look this is really
good news for your waterline and
dragging underneath so happy with that
moving on to make up for the phone so
this is really exciting I've never seen
makeup before over before I've seen all
online but I've never seen a caterer and
never played with the product and I went
a bit buck Wales to be honest first
thing I did was I caught my shadows
so I got the level three power lets you
buy the pallet individually and then you
get eyeshadows by themselves no these
out your shadows are like 15 pounds each
and they are massive so I thought make
up forever arms or the expensive brands
quite affordable it's much today but
it's not as dude as other brands I've
used before so I've got an SV palette
I've got two Macanese because I have
like hardly any might need and I got the
most beautiful peddle a second blue
shadow so let's do little swatches for
you I think that is cheapest we over
there
you see right there the most beautiful
matte shadows and they work really well
offer a nice base and so I got that and
I got some more fun ones so I thought I
was looking at all the colors and I was
thinking actually well I've got a
million neutrals I've got x at purples
and pinks and things like that I don't
actually have that many blues because it
looked ain't a very much blue but these
are insane so beautiful so I will less
the colors that they are underneath that
kind of comes they better come a bit
number to think so it's not the easiest
but I'll list them for you and I swatch
Lord so I know what ones oh goody and
I'm really excited to use these guys so
it's all need to try products so I got
the Makeup Forever HD foundation and I
am usually in NC 25 in Mac or an 8.5 in
Alaska and I am in 107 and the color is
perfect it is perfect I don't have it on
today
I've tried it for a couple of days I
really do like it but it doesn't give me
the googliness that's gonna be stars
that I love so much
I'm the coverage and it definitely a
sheer to medium coverage I think I had
to use a bit for pump still I was happy
with the coverage it gave me so I found
for your cat and for people that like
later publisher foundation definitely
try it because it looks so gorgeous
it wears really real
da-fu planeman puto firstly our water
either then and it looks like a bit
especially around like my nose area and
things I don't wanna feel like eating
poems in theme and I got the Makeup
Forever HD powder and did a few saw the
pictures of celebrities they'll actually
had they hold it all over their feeds
that was that but used wrong but this
isn't a same powder this is a fishing
boat oh so you're made to just use a
teeny little bit just a lake around June
was near maybe under the eye just the
tiniest little bit and just kind of buff
it into this game rather than state your
makeup like that because it'll look
crash doable a couple of X I got from
brands that I hadn't really heard of are
the V Ramona do or college so I've heard
good things about guys it was actually a
couple of girls that was West at retain
all working me to get that sounds like I
might want that today yeah it was
officially bad that rural to you
actually just sparked each other on to
buy all that stuff it was insane so the
color swatch is like that and this bit
here is like I really cannot tough for
me like a blow-up aritaum's
and in the middle is just like a lot
kind of soft I wonder what your main you
do is put a little bit a water in here
and you can weight your brush and then
you swallow your brush around here and
it just gets rid of any color that was
stuck to your brush so you could go in
with a black eyeshadow swirl it around
that mingle in with a plate it'll be
totally clean so exciting paint saving
brush
Stevie I got two left liquids from a
legal the matte flat finish pigment
gloss and I got this one is backstage
which is like the deepest break into pet
like plum and then I got Fleur like
Fleur Delacour
feel like haddock water and which is
just like I believe in Anita news I
tried the night went on and I loved it I
tried to use this one yesterday and I
think you made a bit of a lip liner
under it because I it's been so long
trying to build up
hello and wait a little bit clogged up
and a bit funny every bit funny so I'm
going to try that again but with a
pencil underneath it to give the color
and then this to just give the deepen up
a little Bank of the mix finish but yeah
good will good only like four pounds 50
so I kind of the completed kind of I got
a lot of sugar pedal it was so nice
because a shank Oh is there a me that
wonder if I should repel I didn't think
she was gonna be here I don't know why
like why would she come all the way to
London
oh I usually it was quite nice to me ok
nice this year and I got the addicted to
pretty eye shadow collection which is
the braids and again it's all impressed
with the size of the palette the size of
eyeshadows are fab and the color payoff
is beautiful sort of Italy little
swatches I'm surprised those these for
and I've used the red and the purple
already and I'm a fan really lovely
really really mad and not too expensive
for being cold luxury brands and I went
to England I really wanted to get one of
the fleet of palette so I freedom
palette something that you get your
bought that you get the palette and you
can actually just choose anything you
want to win say that but the Cure was
absolutely massive all day we were only
there for two till 5:00 so I three hours
till actually be showing this please and
I got
Jude Elaine but it has been recommended
to me for softened up products like so
your gel windows dries up or your your
braids at Rose dries up you put a little
better lesson and avoiding zit rate back
up so it was really felt for that and I
got the black gel liner and the white
gel liner because I made to be amazing
tried to bite one of my waterline today
it's lasting it's definitely last thing
I want to do flex with the fight and
then I'll get back to tell you here is
the black I've heard it's just the best
thing about super super dark super
creamy so not like it but I shall over
and I'll let you know okay
I got the house of glam dolls concealer
palette this is made by David Horne who
I've met a couple of times because he
used to work with illamasqua when I
worked there and he helped formulate
products so my thought process was I
love the products from Illamasqua I'm
probably gonna love this so really
affordable I think it's 25 paintings
normally and we bought it for like 22 my
girls they take 20% off for something
that wouldn't work
okay I don't know but yeah it comes in a
really cute little wheel and then you've
got your later sheets for concealing and
perfect in this game and then it says
it's got to sculpt in sheets so these
are really good for carbonate rose or a
cheap Bolingbroke forever and then the
metal it's got a really beautiful
illuminate and products but I actually
wasn't good no I didn't think I would
love it and yeah I do
I really do love it I can see me putting
that on underneath my highlight so BEC
fine so far - max ooh I forgot this
amazing brush Keith rokay this is a
rubbish Oh guys I'm not joking Oh like
this and so you've got to so what I'm
thinking
see you are a traveler and you do that
straight there we go
locket and the Eric Mason Steve and in a
when you go to do a job you remove the
lid turn that up same thing use your
brush and then the dirt your brushes you
put another side so you call your clean
brushes and they say know you've got
your ones inner side so you know of what
you've used and you know what you've got
to clean another thing I forgot to take
from Mac was Nilo and eye shadow which
is it look beautiful Jay Rahu is like I
type this on and here and on a label and
every day and every day I was like of
course you go on in your eyes
that was there was a lot of that little
became like how did you not what
Claire's would be I need
and I got saddle eyeshadow which we used
to be able to buy but no you can only
get implore it got a really cute little
empty palette from pusat doing this one
but any palettes that amazing which you
can do part if you want with them so I'm
thinking I made you can't concealers and
today because I'm planning on saving up
and getting more care than according to
skin enhancers because I'm absolutely
obsessed for them so I thought I could
put them in a little space because it
will need a little bit of plane or you
could use them for a lipstick or
whatever but that's what it's good for
close the little plastic bits that are
actually sealed on to it so it won't go
all messy and then you went to Mooji
again cute little tubs that these are
for teens but I'm going to put coconut
oil and named for my cat I got the
really adorable little tiny tiny tiny be
cotton buds which are great for it
cleanup and for a precision and if
anyone's ever got any and their and
their eyes scoop that out we split up
ourselves because again I literally
picked up so many little hints and tips
over the weekend what we're gonna do in
here is I'm gonna make its effects plus
and softening lotion from Mac a little
bit of rose water because amber had that
made up in the fridge and in London it
was just in and she's they all come here
at but she's really thin said oh my god
come here let me spray me with this let
me spray with this I would say okay what
does it say the kitchen spider in fix+
and softening lotion and I dyed my face
felt at me said and it smelled so good
so I'm gonna make one little concoction
these these are washing sheets face
lotion sheets so these are like take it
ups are cold and what you do is you put
in his water and the full guide oats
like a face mask and you just put it on
your skin and you give to it like
different things on them but it's so
good for the hydrate in the skin so and
someone was saying that they saw Mac our
excuse me no Fashion Week oh oh so it's
facing and the same
idea but just for under here so I'm
thinking in the morning if you like
clown park you know looks like a couple
they love when I'm making a call fake
I'm gonna be looking for a Sheltie well
anything that's brand new to me but I've
seen uploads on Instagram weren't there
elect his mate X Gatos so they had a
stole there and they were so lovely
there was actually thrown glitters at
everyone so I went and and I bought this
one here which is champagne wishes and
it's just a beautiful gold it's got
finger and secular through it and they
give me the best for free evening so
I've got literally all the colors here
if you want to see these swatches of
these I have used a couple of my
Instagram but if he hates over to my
blog sass form calm I'm going to be
doing swatches of these and a review so
you head over there em last thing I saw
I didn't know that they were gonna be
there but I saw there was a king art
with ill daughter lash eyes so it was so
nice to meet the owner she was so lovely
and she gave me a lovely little set of
lashes and which I'm really excited
about absolutely all of their lashes I
think over they're the best ever and
I've got a blog post up and size for my
favorites just know they brought a few
new sales that I am 100% absolutely
obsessed way so what I think I may have
to do beat up the old monopolist but aha
it was so much fun I had the greatest
name ever in and like I say thank you so
much to you guys who came up and said hi
it was so nice to see everyone thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
