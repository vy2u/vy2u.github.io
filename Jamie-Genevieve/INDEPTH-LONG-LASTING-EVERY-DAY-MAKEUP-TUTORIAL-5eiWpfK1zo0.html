I am back with a makeup look I feel like
I've not filmed I made a couple of and
so long I've been really really lucky
lately traveling a ton but I have missed
my setup I miss you guys I've missed
beaten-up face like an angel I just been
messing it all so this is a look that I
cannot came up with when I was in Tokyo
I say came up with is so basic and so
standard I know they're not a couple of
little tips that I've picked up that
made this makeup last really really long
I wore this makeup for 14 hours one day
and it still looked the exact same at
the end so yeah I really hope you like
that there's a couple of new products in
here I carefully really old but goodies
only older but goodies and I just really
hope you like this tutorial and I will
see a little words if you would like to
see how I created this look and please
stay tuned hello get me up at 4:30 a.m.
so I feel a little bit crazy right now
that's makeup look as my recent go to
I'm sure to explain that already and I'm
just gonna jump right and there's no
that many products a little bit easier
than usual let's do this first I'm gonna
grab is my fainty from ourselves her
primer and my new way of using this is
getting two pumps on my hand and
literally just rubbing my hands together
and just put them all over and this I
think is a key part to find my makeup
always lasts really long so we're
rubbing that in then we're bringing it
down her neck slightly because I always
do go down my neck with a little bit of
foundation just leave and by the way
I've done almost getting care of
beforehand so essence oil moisturizer
then the primer that's why I do in the
mornings
the foundation I'm going to go and with
as the all hours foundation by YSL this
is the shade beady sexy and I have been
using this a lot a lot a lot I use this
a time before I went away with him to
Tokyo and then when I go to Tokyo they
had a different she
for me which is this shade which is my
that matters me like perfect so I'm
gonna take two pumps of that at the back
of my hand and then I'm going to take a
foundation brush this is my Smith brush
the 133 and we're just going to apply
this straight onto the skin I don't know
I see at first I always think that looks
like a little bit off the color and then
it always just work so it always looks
good and then that's for Indian I feel
like it's a really buildable coverage
I've got a couple a little break okay
I'm pretty convinced it's from the plane
I don't think it's remains and I've been
using not changed my routine at all
so I'm Tracy sure it's a mixture of
maybe pollution maybe the plane me and
Jack had the best time and he's not seen
our weekly look maybe you should go to
that I want to say just one of the most
amazing experiences of my whole life
I will remember it forever and ever when
I was away this is the exact makeup that
I did every single day and when we were
away we have newly long days like we
were up and out of the hotel by 8:30 in
the morning and then we wouldn't really
get home until like maybe like a 11:00
at night so the foundation will that's
makeup in general lasted so well every
single day and I think maybe it's
because this foundation is a really good
coverage it's also a little bit more mad
than what I'm used to if you guys have
been around here for a while and you
know that I love my NARS foundation as
well if you want to comparison I think
this one is really release timeline and
taster I think it looks beautiful a few
of my friends actually and then just
over said that they think it's really
similar I think it's super similar but I
think this there's a little bit more
matte and a little bit longer reading so
this was me both two thieves they're
still Linares on this one but this is
the one I've been using more and it just
seems to be great for long lasting
I think the NARS when I would go slow
lately to shiny by the end of the day
and then I'm just taking NEX Hasty
Pudding a minute that's pretty cool
I'm actually just harvest like I just
think it's so beautiful and it see legs
if you just use like half a pump and
just put it in the eaters you need and
prefer it is stunning is beautiful the
concealer I'm gonna use as the Laura
Mercier flawless fusion ultra one word
concealer I don't think I've talked
about this
but I Flynn loved it I think as my new
favorite I think I prefer to shoot it
because as more hydrating under my eye I
don't get that creepy Creasy dry under
eye with it know that I got loads of
that with shape tape I do just think I
like this a wee bit their color that I'm
using is 3w which I'm guessing that w is
warm so it's quite yellow toned and I
just used that underneath my eyes on the
forehead usual areas and I don't
actually use it to spot conceal I'm
gonna blend that it was my foundation
brush and when I'm going near my eyes
I'm really careful not to go too close
to my life because we're not doing
anything to our eyelids whatsoever we're
leaving them blank and you guys if
you've been around for a wee while
you'll know that I've done a couple of
looks like this and it's just so easy
when you skip that whole step it just
makes you doing your makeup really
really quick got a new little technique
to show you a new secret and I just
tried this for the first time in Tokyo
and it worked so well so next one we're
gonna win he's bringing that right off
underneath the eye it gives you that
nice brightness that you need and I
think I don't know what it's gonna look
like on camera but see for me this color
match for me it's just perfect
I'm just gonna go in I've still got some
foundation last on the back of my hand
but because of my recent breakouts I'm
just gonna buy some more foundation just
over the blemishes and just the bad
areas it seems to be like here I don't
know if you guys know much about sports
but what do you think that this is from
why is this happening to me is it
something I did
did I do something wrong I deserve it
that is my basic gun I'm gonna quickly
powder underneath my eyes and I'm gonna
be used and my fav Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless Spanish powder it's so
exciting because when I look at other
youtubers and their videos I see Awards
of people love this and greatly bloody
so it's my favorite Pedro
ever I've got a couple I've got a few I
really love the pure one as well but
this is the one I always just reached
for and always travel with it so I'm
gonna take some of that
I'm gonna go under her eyes and then
just the same videos but like I said
there's foundations a wee bit more matte
I feel like you don't have to use as
much powder no it's AIT's a bronzer face
I think I've used this in a couple of
videos but I've been using it
consistently for weeks and this is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills perturb ruins
are in the shade saddle I absolutely
love it it is very pigmented though so
you need to be really careful with how
you apply it so the way that I'm going
to apply it is with my Smith 1 180 brush
is just a gut dense powder brush and
we're gonna pick up some just a little
bit at a time and then I'm gonna start
at the back of my cheek and then little
circular motions we're just gonna start
warming up her face I don't tend to
powder my face that much so whenever I
did my bronzer it's always on top of
flash foundation whenever I'm trying out
a new bronzer for the first time I
always look to see if it blends nicely
on top a fresh foundation and that's
what really does feel so much better my
nose with a tiny little amount of it and
then I just go down my neck slightly now
for blush art I've been using this a ton
this is the Milani blush in Luminoso
sautés and I'd like to apply that with a
mace of philosophy bag bronzer brush and
I just grabbed it a little bit on the
tip of the brush totally smile and then
I just kind of stamp on and it's just
for a little flush of color blusher you
know it just it doesn't make you look at
illiberal it does I've never used to use
blusher and I never used to look
adorable so that can't be a coincidence
see for highlight we're gonna have to
have a moment of silence this is my Mac
or darling highlighter and look what's
happened
it's totally cracked and it's just
chillin in the pan like this but I am
NOT always embarrassing and I will use
it so we're gonna go in with or darling
highlight by Mac and I'm just gonna
touch the top of my cheeks just like so
I'm not going to harm with the
highlighter Japan of Oz that came back
from Japan a different person I am
I am century my face is feng shui we've
moved things around we are not doing as
much height of a thing
well we are just a little bit of the
cheeks we're keeping it off the center
of her face but apart from my nose and
my Cupid's bow but we're not going to go
too cheeky with it
I am cheeky look a little touch above
the arch of the brow just because of
those foundations a little bit more
matte it's really nice to just add a bit
more shine okay I'm just gonna swap over
tell little eyeshadow brush and I'm
gonna apply this highlight to the
Cupid's bow the tip of my nose and then
just up here the bridge of my nose okay
I think now it really makes this
produces all my selves so to seal all
this then obviously we've got a trailer
on which is going to help the foundation
last all day the foundation is not super
super do so that's gonna help as well
and then I've been using the YSL makeup
setting spray for weeks now and I really
really like it I think it's got a really
nice master
I'll show you see that date dint
expensive luxury it's really really nice
or Widow
wait I've been using this you guys
I love the Urban Decay all nighter spray
but I do not always love the GU share
sometimes I feel like I end up getting
big blotches a product on my face when
I'm going to use it product that so
honestly the way that I would explain it
is this it does exactly what this does
but that's what has a much nicer
applicator and it pulls out a lot softer
and you don't get any of the splash each
spray you know so I've kind of kind of
moved on okay so now we're set or
foundations lookin great and I'm gonna
move on to brows so the bread product
I've been using I'm flippin lovin as the
car bro by benefit this is the chute
number four and I'm gonna zoom you in
and show you her so I'm gonna just come
through a little eyebrows this is how it
comes it's like a pony and when you use
the brush that comes with
cuz you guys always go crazy and say
that that's rubbish to me you have to
use the brush it comes with it mm-hmm
and the way that I've been doing my
eyebrows is just by starting on the top
so straight away it would kinda be a bit
bare a little bit more elevated I've
been watching a lot of Queen right
right in fact I mean I've finished it
and I like oh he always says elevated
like you'd feel better you feel elevated
what's going through the tail of my
brain I just they build that up a little
bit more as well and then when we come
towards this front we've got hardly any
product on our brush I'm just gonna put
a really late shadow of the product
there and then what you can do is you
can actually use a spillage just to
really brush that out and it just looks
a little bit more groomed and defined
but nothing crazy
now if than that they're not looking too
crazy they're just really nicely
naturally defined there are darker in
those days and later on the metal that's
like the classic hombre eyebrow what I'm
gonna take now as my 24 hour bro Center
this is the Bass Pro tool on the market
once you've done it it dries and your
pro years are literally never gonna move
until you wash your face it's the best
even if you use this when you've got no
makeup on like if I was just to go to
the gym and I don't have any makeup on
at all I would still use this to go
through my eyebrows because it makes
them look so groomed and beautiful I
just absolutely love it so I'm going
through the whole breath this kind of
helps blend that permeate through them
as well get rid of any chunky bits if
anything's been laughs Theory from here
we're gonna be able to eyes and you'll
know awesome you've not used anything on
our eyes at all we don't have any
foundation or concealer primer or
eyeshadow or anything and my new fave
thing is what we're going to do from
here is literally a flick
cat time we're going to do a nice liner
and then we're gonna do lashes and wait
to see how finished your makeup looks so
the liner I'm going to use is
NYX Cosmetics epic ink liner this is
just my favorite ever and it is super
affordable because the next you know
that I love it and what its gonna do our
wings it's not a huge rank it's not a
crazy writing it's just a really nice
pretty wing that's followed on from our
Laura lash line so it's pretty elevated
there but there's that word again and it
just makes your eye look a really lovely
shape and then you can kind of go over
it again if you want it to be a little
more black once your little wings are
done all you have to do is take your
lashes my favorite Sailor lashes are the
Mykonos lashes by Lily lashes they just
last absolutely J's when I was away I
pretty much used one pair of eyelashes
for the whole time the only news not
changed the month was because I wanted
to change my look up you know tech Froyo
as once you have opened them
just keep your box and you can put them
back in here you'll remember where they
are you won't find them stopped here at
all so when I'm driving my lashes always
work from the inside out and then I'm
gonna cut off two stems while I'm
waiting for my little lashes to dry I'm
gonna find my mascara this is the iconic
London boom mascara since it came out
and I tried it I absolutely loved it
through gonna apply a coat of that to
the top lashes first I don't apply too
much to them because of her second
lashes on anyway you don't really need a
heavy Haley mascara on the top when
you're using falsies doesn't matter and
then it will were waiting for those
lashes to dry out and when it did a
little Fred Cole we're still away and
for those lashes to dry so I thought I'd
show you another little tip that I
picked up when I was away and I'm gonna
take my bronze it again and this little
fancy schmancy brush from Smith this is
a 220 brush any brush will do to the
oldest and it's nice and small and when
it'll end with this bronzer and I'm
gonna go along my lower lash line
bro I bronzer was just like a warm brown
eyeshadow really isn't it but this is
super light so it's not gonna drag your
I doubt it's not going to look too heavy
and all of the soon as Freeman you're
under died and we're paying a little bit
more as well so you can see the
difference I just dreamed my eyes a
little bit and we're ready for some
bought mascara once our top lashes are
on primer wait for those to dry I'm just
gonna apply some bottom mascara just
going in with a chronic boo much again
that mascara for bottom lashes is the
best so good but you do need to wait for
it to dry so I kind of need to set like
this for a bit and then I feel like down
and it's printed but home so if you do
look down and it prints coming to get my
socks in my lair anyway if you look down
in a print it's the best thing to do is
just leave it to dry and then use of
spilling just to pressure off but I'm
going to take some of my old darling
highlight my Mac wanted to highlight
minor corner okay I'm gonna zoom you
eight and we're gonna do our lips what
so that is our filthy it's pretty much
done all we've got left to do is our
lips
question for you guys do you get annoyed
with me using the same product over and
over again or do you not mind it because
you might have gotten involved um so
surely we want to use them again I try
and do products all the time but
sometimes I just want to use my faves
you know but let me know there below if
you've much other that I try new things
thought maybe you'd prefer if I started
doing like a fill face of new products
and then we can go for there or don't
them just either than randomly you know
you let me know them below okay so my
faves that I'm going to use are my urban
decay liar and lip liner and my
maybelline superstay matte ink in the
shade driver so I'm just gonna line my
lips
and then we're gonna pull up on our
Maybelline and then I always like to use
my finger just to blend the lip liner
and the lipstick in and that you guys as
the finished look I really hope you
liked it it's just something that I
thought was really really easy it's a
really simple go to look but it's still
classy and classic enough that you can
read it oh you can read it you can read
it whenever absolutely whatever I wore
this to Disneyland I wore this to a huge
event and Tokyo I wore this on a play
you know generally mean so you can just
you can go hard you read it whatever you
want
you enjoy it I hope you liked it and I
will see you in the next tutorial
