hi guys welcome back to my channel today
we are doing something really fun I am
going to be showing you guys the news
instant magic facial drying sheet mask
from Charlotte Tilbury so quick back
story I was lucky enough to be invited
to London to attend the Charlotte
Hillary events which was focusing on
like her skincare and stuff like that so
basically the whole day was because
she's brought this new face mask it's a
sheet mask I am lucky enough to meet
Charles nose down there she is
incredible she's really fun and he's
obviously fever all her hard work has
got her but also I made the women she is
a Canadian lady from Montreal who was at
the event as well and she spent seven
years making this match so I have some
notes so a quick brief summary of the
mask and it's not a wet sheet mask as a
dry mask so see when you feel it it
feels like cotton and and it has bio
limit X vector agility system which
allows your prologue the list of actives
and paired them into the epidermis
so my memory chart and with Charlotte's
QC and that leaves and the goodness in
this mask is basically delivered into
the skin and it was three layers deep
into the epidermis which is super deep
into the skin I have a higher dosage of
active ingredients and the most potent
delivery system so these masks that have
wooded leaf you like really really
watery when you're gone quite all
friends they've got tons of glycerin and
them what you means that basically they
don't penetrate deep enough into the
skin to make a real difference with on
this I I was like I'm not going to say I
was scared to call asshole but I was
really intrigued into how it works
because I always thought your skin has
to be wait for anything to work also
that you have had more makeup on for its
work but this I would've put on no
makeup skin obviously I've taken all my
makeup off if you're interested in what
skincare I use I do have another video
on that which I'll link below or it'll
pop up on the screen here somewhere and
as my
to get amazing with me that your which
is all kind of skincare and we're going
to maintain and things like that and I
do to go into detail a little bit as
well spa that's a little bit clutch beat
the collet I have actually tried this
mask before but it does not close
because I was hungover so that is the
first time I'm actually trying it with
the super clean skin and but it so
Oliver there's just so much information
I'm not gonna I'm not going to bore your
guide by reading all this I don't know
that is boring whatsoever but I know
that you guys have put a see the mask
and see what it does
so let's open this baby up I'll link all
the information you will need to know
down below this video
is not fun so I was just really excited
about that and I think it's quite a
children to try I love watching videos
it's like brand new mask I'm going to
try a like what's going on there so
that's the cool I'll quit like I think
of this mask as the spread for your skin
and the magic screen as the water so
fast and she going so busily at that
okay CT repent and then eventually it
receivable and I'll tell you hi to cross
the mask and dry the cotton dry feelin
you can reuse this up to three times so
that's the first thing with me using
this one it's over
and if you look at my skin to snowed as
you can my makeup off but not so any
moisture at all and so you can see that
that's going fine and my redness here a
little blemish here that's still human
and here but overall Ruskin's actually
doing create Rangers now here's the mask
if you like nothing if you'll be paper
it's not weight at all it's not oily
nothing it's so really I'm going to open
up so it does it just feels like out the
core and that's it and then you've got
your eyeballs your nose wall I'm wearing
a diversity for the Charlotte Tilbury
because it's got sharp GT presidents the
masks and all that all the ingredients
actually leaders in the stuff that works
in this mask and printed onto the mask
is real slick to this on its core tunics
to go behind your ears
cute and then under here and closets as
well and you took that under your chin
and then over your ears and actually
done so obviously it's like it's got my
face so this is a great tight feeling
but it's good it's not a paper mark
hurt my ears or anything are they legal
can hate it it does not smell like
anything doing no smell no offense and
not oily so it's not going to put my
heater in my bath and on the packet it
says hi Jase let's register drink cold
smooth and rayon so those are business
it was absolutely respect products Nate
waited to cathedra and that is 0.08
inches if you could not leak it says one
unfold Rask please a pink shade oh
oh no I do not know where you please the
paint's identify you should listen to
this flippin instruction please the
Pink's laid on traces of arretez gather
it up and then gently massage on top of
the marker argue with the magic
ingredients from in the work for 15
minutes for a breaker program
rejuvenated complexion so basically you
tell your skin what you wanted to do I'm
like I want to be nice and smooth here I
want to be nice and smooth here I was
best to stay up forever oh what a joy
come on come on
so there's brother the end but it feels
really weird it feels like you're not
doing anything because of cotton grow on
me I look like I'm gonna chow down on
some human and then I'm going to kill it
for 15 minutes probably watch some
trailer Liars you know me and my seeded
serieses my TV shows are the worst
folder and I'll report back to you guys
in 15 minutes
hi okay so you guys I find out some
stuff are we thinking my manuals and I
thought I'd let you know what the genius
ingredients are so we have vitamin b3
that brightens toward and desires the
skin Google magic word the plant stem
cell matrix which lets the skin and
helps decrease Franco's cooker spelled
were literally crocus bulbs extract
which we densifies the skin it supports
the construction and encourages collagen
elastin production peg page which work
together to reduce wrinkles and a magic
oils and butters help strengthen the
skin the lymphatic lipid ik not cameras
nor a scheduler
we're alive from gonna see a lipid
bilayer financials noticed Google yeah
so one of these masks cost 18 pounds but
if you'd paid that by industry uses
about six pounds each and then you can
get full of them for sixty pounds which
as a fever of work telcos they're going
to be exclusively at hardly next from
the second of March and at all Charlotte
Tilbury printers so closely James
Charlotte Oprah / Spitzer so the video
effect of March

I'm doing a video about this before
luncheon I will treasure myself because
it is dry and will never harbor bacteria
like sloppy wait sheet masks unit masks
up to three chains anywhere and anytime
also you can wear this over at me cups
so see if you've got all your makeup on
and you need you need that goal not
going to lie one of the goals of this
event had a really dark lipstick on and
it did smudge the lipstick but see skin

orientations

report back on snapchat / Twitter so

had this on trick 15 minutes so let's
take off and face the brand-new face
underneath can you see the glow ah I
look at the flesh on baby

feels he partnered up to touch
it's like do it feels do it and one may
receive when I had this on last payment
I had my eyes shut and I had no problems
but this plane I was watching TV and
paging up with makeup disc and kind of
hide it was almost like a slave thing in
a station my eyes nothing clued these
but it must have just been some of the
ingredients at the ingredients
kinda like messed it up not sure they're
fine notice it
got all the trains but when I was doing
it I felt is a slight like folks will
use these videos are for honest
guarantee my skin obviously I'm just a
wee young soon but there's literally no
lanes or anything in my skin at least
Club at least moisturize a few of the
Musa my skin feel awesome my skin feels
really really good club I had some dry
patches on my nose before that and

blemishes and that's gone and I do to
sleep like a dewy little princess and
