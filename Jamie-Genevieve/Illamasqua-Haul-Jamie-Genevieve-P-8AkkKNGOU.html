been a bit two hours since my last up
full with by I was reminded on Instagram
that you dead promise you
double YouTube this week so here we go I
was expecting and delivery from
Illamasqua today so I thought I'd do a
whole video and it's actually it's
exciting for me too because I can't
remember what I ordered I went online
and I went a bit crazy so it's gonna be
exciting for you and for me so he knows
it came about 15 minutes ago
oh it's coming back it's coming back to
me so it looks like I've ordered quite a
few things it's a lot a few things you
may or may not know that I work for
another mascot as soon as I saw the code
I knew that I was right there but I
watched our masks you know for here and
I want to see like three months a year
and three months when it's been amazing
it's been so so good I have learned more
come on Ken or then I did it two years
of college you don't say so I'll start
off my whole it looks gorgeous
looks peaceful so start off with
eyelashes
Steve stakes eyelashes up or don't I
number one the lush lash then he's a
wild like your social bag but they look
amazing see if you're doing like a
really dramatic makeup you look
absolutely insane I've got my four teens
these are beautiful I would say quite
natural from Illamasqua stand there's
these are probably the most natural that
they do that I would wear they do do
smaller ones but I just don't see the
point and they're gorgeous nice and rain
deserves to see if you wanted you could
cut them in half and just really who's
the old can a half lashes just cute and
then 21 is my absolute favorites
they are very flaky OE if you know I
mean hold across and over as well and
tres closely so they are quite Westby
for my clashes but see for example like
I'm doing today but you can watch a
tutorial on if you click here and look
lashes like that school soil with a
makeup like
because it's so flaky in window and it's
almost me to fly way next I got perfect
oh no oh no oh no it's flippin broken
and trying to that I stay table look at
that oh my god I'm Davis t8 I don't know
I don't know how I'm going to come back
to my skies I'm got eights I was so
excited to my legs
this is a powder foundation and it's in
color two four zero it's in color two
four zero which is the perfect bronze
and shades if you are my color or even
dark and I would say but it's broke and
what we're going to do that right we'll
do that is eight okay well sit again can
see lows perfect if you have watched my
contour module you'll see that I use
concealers I use light one and deep two
and their skin base left so these are
really really clearly concealers up shop
I mean social you them they're very very
creamy really peachy undertone is way oh
so they're very left and many highlights
hang on there pair of face for Quinn
sitting and they're really good under
the eyes if the claim she does well off
but I love a I love a quarter so light
shade for highlight and dark shade for
corn to time nice new French ones for
Moony next eyeshadows will do a little
swatch to these as well and so starting
off they're all quite neutral actually
that's what I need I mean I've got so
many colored eye shadows and stuff I
needed of you replayed on my neutrals so
we have wolf sex justify and heroine so
start off with will both as a beautiful
dark diamonds to see if he return a
neutral eye or a little colored eye that
you need a little bit darker wolf is
Gorge
so let's list it a little swatch if you
haven't used our shadows you there very
pigmented you just need a tiny little
bit and they're very marked as well so
it takes a little bit getting used to
working with
you once you know how to work with them
and do the best thing ever sex is Hawaii
it it's its way to the snow it's
beautiful
and again Pegman it's Glee which is very
rare and quite a shads or at a peak
hoser all like it just does not happen
so glorious to have that in my life
justify justify civilian ease blend and
a color if you know I'm saying so you've
got so it's quite okay hasn't got very
good describing which to do yeah Cory
Toby's not too dissimilar to moments ago
and should be obviously new things are
glad to blame Joe might find so that's
good fun and in here do it very late
justify to be honest but you never have
enough neutral eyeshadow yeah that deep
but I would say let's have a let's have
a little swatch it's cool it's very cool
much cooler it's so cool like me and
then at my last I shot so much weight
that last I shadow is concrete and I am
quite certain that this isn't to see
what I know I'm pretty sure creep is
like a freaky lilac blue but it's
absolutely beautiful and I've been
playing a lot with my color I let's play
that at all I mean zone
it's like Bluebell sick of Bluebell
color isn't it and I've always been
pleading a color a lot more these days
so I needed something about definite and
I can guide into you I do not have a
nation under like that mascara
tangled on mascara or squatter
as they call it is glorious it's all you
need to know mascara it's got a big
Brush big chunky ass brush and the car
is so so black so Steve cause I'm quite
dark here I need a mascara it's gonna
look like black I need to up mascara
that is as black as night
black is made yes um so that's perfect
really really easy to get off his veil
but doesn't crumble through the day so
I'm trying a few
I've slowly crumbled into my eyes
through the day and their minds get
irritated we feet and eye makeup goes
all over the place not gonna happen but
I suppose I was just fat
the next two I'm very very excited about
it because I can't get them on my
counter

lipstick and beer and I've had so many
people come into account ncie press
