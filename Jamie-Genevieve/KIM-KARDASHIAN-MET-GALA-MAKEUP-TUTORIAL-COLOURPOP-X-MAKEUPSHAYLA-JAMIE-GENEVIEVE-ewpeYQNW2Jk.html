we are going to be doing this is super
super glam look is inspired by Kim
Kardashian's makeup at the Met Gala I
absolutely love that I am late to the
game there are so many tutorials on that
look already so what I thought I would
do is collaborate to video idea so I
really really wanted to show you guys
the Sheila color pop collection but I
also wanted to do a super glam
I am a cup just like okay so I have
married them together I have managed I
might as a blast forever no divorce so
if you would like to see how I created
this entire look then please stay tuned
let's start with her face I'm going to
use the fancy Beauty Pro filter my
primer I absolutely love this the way
that I use it is two pumps rub them in
my hands and hi Oliver
look how buckwild my nails I s best
video looks weird it's probably because
my nails are great for the cover-up put
them beyond now I'm going to use the LA
respond even from YSL and the shade be
sexy I know you guys love watching me do
my base and things like that so I'm
gonna do it but I'm just gonna go
through it really quickly it because
it's more about the other person makeup
that I have been using this foundation
everyday for you just do a nice
absolutely love it it's super long
readin but it does go out nice and dewy
like your natural oils come through and
it just looks amazing so if anyone was
wondering I'm still loving this and I've
done all my skincare underneath my frame
right my skin is really coming on and
once I've used all the stuff that I've
been trialing it for long enough to know
that it definitely works I'll definitely
be doing an updated skincare video once
earth invasion is on we're gonna go in
with concealer I am absolutely loving
the Lord o mercy a flawless fusion
concealer this is the shade CW I have
been using
like I think I'm gonna finish that
actually but this is in my opinion the
best concealer that's a right now
absolutely love it conceal under our eye
all the usual spots and foreheads
because that is very I still have just a
couple of blemishes those that yeah I
just think it gives a really nice smooth
finish
and today's base is gonna be fill
coverage but glowy and bronze mmm
gorgeous I think I can see their works
on top of the foundation so well no and
is honestly the piece I've been doing so
much lately and the better my skin is
getting the last foundation I have to
use and I always have so much left on
the back of my hand so just start with
one pump over the foundation if you're
if you're using what I sell well we are
freshly applied we don't want any powder
or dirt or anything I'm going to go in
with the new days or die be bronzing
stick and this is by mid sticks
absolutely love their stuff and I'm just
gonna warm up my face and say the
contour as well such a good color and
then I'm actually just gonna use my
foundation brush to blend that in I love
the roast forehead now if you're not
very into bronzer I think that that
looks really lovely and natural you
could totally just use that stick but I
live for the bronze so we're gonna
bronze our face up with a powder now I'm
gonna go in with the urban decay beached
bronzer and the shade bronzed as you can
see it's just like a little bit darker
and it would just drawn this up in a
really you know a nice subtle ash
fashion there's such a nice color it's
not too warm so it's not too orange it
doesn't make you look you know I'm knew
less think I want to go for a realistic
time how she's been on holiday has she
been bathing in the Sun and I'm going to
do the same thing that I always do and
just given all that little total balls
ice cream it Said's and this is like a
very natural it's now
remove the noise and then that's you
should makeup artist Tara do you know
what I was thinking guy that actually I
really rested in makeup I think I'm
gonna have set get my brushes out and
maybe transform some people on human
here on the tube question for you if you
had to pick what youtuber that I
transformed who respect let me know down
below because I would absolutely love to
do that it's been so long and I never
stopped doing makeup because I didn't
like it I just thought because this part
of my life luckily I really like
blessedly who's doing well and I don't
have time to do both starters I did
choose this you know balance maybe I'll
get my brush to say okay
now I'm gonna take my Charlotte's help
buddy irreversible Spanish pay dirt and
number two I were just gonna set
underneath your eyes and they just will
be touching the forehead like I've said
before if you watch my videos you heard
this a million times but this foundation
is a really lovely more matte texture so
you don't have to use as much powder
which I really like okay I need to pray
my eyeballs and powder them down to four
I shot primer I would use the pure get a
grip in June's eyeshadow primer I've got
my primer at the back of my hand and
I've just applied that all over my lid
for my glue I'm back on my
bhinneka or pull chain absolutely love
this stuff of love the forever and it's
base so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
highlight my face pretty severely so I'm
using my face brush this is the zoo we
bought one three four brush it julia is
the base highlight brush Avery and then
I'm gonna just place my face oh no
scratch that didn't mean that doesn't
mean that I totally forgot that I had
all the stuff for Sheila's collection
and I totally forgot that this little
beauty is a high layer so this is the
loose powder highlighter from colour-pop
X
Sheila makeup Sheila and she boomin
mm-hmm had a boomin as
this is the color at look baby golden a
I've seen it on her and at least
absolute Mays and I just hope that I can
pull this off I think I can
what the hell oh my god there you go
there you go friends
well done Sheila could I resupply that
on top of here and yet we're gonna play
this everywhere oh and because it's a
really finely milled loose powder you
could totally put this and like your
Satan's breeding effects pause if you
want it to make a gluey spray because it
is super faint it's not like a chunky
glitter or anything it will need to
highlight every room a so we're gonna do
a breadboard and I like to do my braid
born before did my eyebrows because it
stops to highlight getting everywhere we
put my nose mmm I'm just bringing it one
to my cheeks a little bit you know know
what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna shoot
off camera quickly do my brace and then
I'll bring you back to do it the eye
makeup and lips and just to finish this
look off okay braids are on and I know
what we do is we get into the eye makeup
so my dilemma
I saw the makeup obviously I saw
everyone's looks I thought this year it
was absolutely amazing I have some
favorites for sure
and then I actually guys on Twitter at
what makeup that you would want me to be
created from it and most of you say that
Kim key a lot of you said Selena Gomez
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a
similar spell to CEM keys I makeup but
as my name is up again but what
I'm going to do is imagine going to use
different colors cause I really want to
use Sheila's palette with color pop the
perception palette it has all the shades
written underneath is a beautiful
palette it's got amazing reviews of
everyone and I'm very excited seizes me
I'll show you over simple colors and
using and stuff but I'm basically use
this palette and a few other products to
get a very similar it's tale of
chemically is eye makeup but we're going
to use different colors and stuff you
can see my whole night so far eyes I've
got a little pet you know
actually amazing right still beautiful
so it's just our super intense lash eat
smoky eye I could not find any pictures
of Kum Kee with her eyes don't like to
see her legs but what we're going to do
is we're just gonna recreate this fail
and then I think we're just gonna do
cannot feel black smoke over the head as
well but it's amazing I'm so excited so
let's do this we don't win with culture
first this color right here I'm just
gonna start defining our crease and I
think I'm gonna use blue in this look as
you look at the picture of Kim Kim is
well her eyeshadow is quite feeling it
kind of comes out so we're gonna do that
as well I'm just taking my fluffy brush
color is lovely it's pigmented it's very
warm so I'm just keeping it nice and
high in the oats aids because we want
the shadow to cannot come up here and
just by using a late hand you can kind
of drag that product up I think what I'm
gonna do it on the top is the super
neutral and obviously going straight
dark and then the bottom will do the
flash of blue and then that's when we'll
get the lashes okay the next color I'm
going to go in with is the shade
revenged you're staying here I like
these names Sheila and I'm just gonna
start applying and crease using small
circles a little bit and when you're
using a smaller brush with darker colors
you can just be a little more precise on
where you're putting them and you can
also start to drag that color up as well
because we do want to get that separate
feeling shape and then what you do is go
back home with your fluffier brush just
to help blend all these colors I buy all
these colors I didn't mean to just take
your time make sure you're getting that
shape I actually really like the shape
of this eye makeup so far okay so what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna start
smoking in the top with a darker color
so when you use this shoot here it's
called play date I don't know what that
means I'm not cool enough we're just
gonna use this to start smokey eye the
lash line because it adds a super smoky
sultry look and I'm just using the same
small brush you can go smaller if you
need to
and then you can kind of use this to
start defending that kind of wind eye
shadow a little bit more I love these
colors and I was gonna do a shimmer on
the lid but I actually think I might
leave it
I actually no no no no we're gonna do it
we're gonna do it right we're gonna use
the shade Deva just right here I'm going
to just pack that one with a flat
eyeshadow brush that's gonna it's a
really easy palette to work with the
shadows blend really nicely and all the
color payoff is just what you think it
would be no nasty surprises okay I'm
gonna do my liner now this is the X
matrix superhero liner I've heard a
really good thing so let's go back try
so you kind of even Taylor she's got
laying it on but I'm just gonna do a
little better liner to help help with
this kooky smoky and I'm also gonna
bring it right into my inner corner
now that leaners on what I'm going to do
is keep a smaller brush and we're going
to come okay with the darkest shade in
the palette which is where actually it's
stallion maybe I should use style you
know no we're going to stay warm on the
top so I'm going to use play-doh again
this one right here we're just gonna
smoke a and by that I just mean you go
over Delano it almost kind of does out
the way no it just makes it more kind of
smudged look and it's cool just gonna go
in with play-doh and a bigger brush
married to get more of a feeling of what
the loops gonna look like but all its
gonna look like I'm gonna use my
heartiest eye pencil this blacks really
amazing it's great and what I'm going to
do it wouldn't line my waterline right
into the inner corner and my top
waterline as well I'm gonna tightly okay
tightly and I hate I hate doing this oh
we're going to eat it I actually hate it
I wouldn't give myself a little bit of a
point on the inner corner see that makes
all the difference
let's move on to lashes I have a lash
graveyard so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna pick the thickest longest ones
these ones right here these actually
look kind of similar to what she's
wearing as well but these are the
Frankie lashes by adult beauty I'm going
to glue those up this is the superhero
it cosmetics mascara this is like part
of the same family this is like the
laners Big Brother and we're gonna try
us out today I've heard good things
witness although you know what I think
this is gonna be really good for both
lashes which is
just I need record why am i finding all
of the goodness guys okay we're gonna
not dirt what lashes yet cause we need
to do a bottom lane yeah I actually feel
like it's almost a little bit blue what
she's got on but basically the most
important thing is lashes and I really
smokey under diet that's looks
absolutely nothing like her makeup right
now
a half feet when we end from eyelash to
dry I'm just gonna build this up a
little bit I feel like I was a bit of a
whisper for it yeah I can do bare and
the nice thing about a nice I want to
see chewy a nice troop in so as you can
get right in between your bottom
eyelashes yeah fill in all the little
gaps in between the lashes well it's
more cat doesn't really suit these
lashes are dry they're still spiky and
greet all of them yeah it's a bit about
that do you know what I just want to
have this thing which is chipped eyes
it's come here at all
I've got a little phase now that I've
got my lashes on I can see that I need
to go darker and the crease but that's
fine I can't see take this will carry
your bottle between two smokey eye on
the bottom lash and I'm gonna use less
colour stallion it's like a dark navy
blue it with blue reflex through so
we're going to use that with my teeny
tiny inside number seven and we're just
going to smoke here at this lower lash
line and the good thing about the pants
will be views is it super chewy like I
say it really really gummy and soft so
we can use this color to help blend I I
feel like I don't suggest blend it out
with a little bit of the blue actually
cuz it was just black let's use 14 this
is a really nice light blue Wow if any
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
deciding that the little points and save
my eyes a little bit more I absolutely
love
the makeup that can be heard at the Met
Ball but other secrets where rosie
huntington-whiteley yes why bill be yes
Rihanna the Queen no I'm gonna darken up
the eyes a little bit with play-doh this
one right here just a when I look
forward it's a bit darker back in with
us espera I really think it's gonna be
amazing
you know I actually was considering
using seek eyelashes on the bottom for
this look but this is worth doing good
whoa intense eye I'm gonna demure and
next to the lips
Tempe had the most beautiful dark cannot
ash brown lip line art with a nude lip
which I absolutely love but I'm gonna
hit a do my own version of that with
shields products and I've already
started laying it with my lips with a
liar lip later so I'm gonna finish doing
that and then I'll show you the lipstick
and I'm also doing big glowing lip
school with mother glam eyeballs now for
it looks like we're going to use
quicking it by Sheila so this is the
package and it is color pop it's may
tell it's like a neutrals gold color
it's got a lot of stars all over it it's
got color pop written on it as well and
then the actual lipstick has a little
Spurs on it oh so here so I'm just going
to fire us on we'll see what we're
looking like oh that's a beautiful color
and now I actually just would really
want to try it sometimes from every part
of Sheila's collection so this is the
old truck glossy lip this is the lip
gloss and neat freak and we're just
gonna apply this on us oh it's nice it's
not it's not like a gloopy Stuckey gloss
and I guess look down you guys I hope
you really really like that it was a lot
to find out to do a proper proper glam
look for one huge congratulations to
Sheila for her collaboration with color
pop and
that her first launch sold out really
really quickly but I know as well that
has been restocked on Freddie the
elements so that will have just passed
hopefully there's stuff left I don't
think that this collection will be going
anywhere for a while is too gorgeous if
they need to got away from us and I'll
be pissed so you guys I hope you like
this video and I will see you the next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
