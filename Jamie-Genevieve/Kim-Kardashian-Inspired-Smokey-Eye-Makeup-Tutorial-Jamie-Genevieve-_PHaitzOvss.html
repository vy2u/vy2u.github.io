mommy thank you so much hi guys welcome
back to my channel today we are going to
do there's a I can key shade of course a
smoky eye so it kind of goes hand in
hand with the makeup had that last week
the tutorial ordered last equalness
again so I've done the same kind of
chewy flesh and exact same products if
you want to watch that I'll link it
below but this week we're gonna use some
makeup geek into mellow masks and using
a little ashes to create this beautiful
sultry smoky eye which is perfect for
prom season evening events anything like
that it's quite glam but totally rouble
and really really easy to use we also I
hope you guys like this video and I'll
be back next week with another way satin
off with makeup geek shadow and cream
really I'm gonna use that in my crease
I've claimed my eye already with soft
ochre by Mac and I've used a little bit
of the shadow because I forgot to film
it using our eyes we've a blending brush
just small motions for that then I'm
gonna end with the brow gel and straight
by Illamasqua this stuff is amazing as a
base the Kois the shadow just sticks on
top and it lasts all day so because it
is a gel is a little bit harder to blend
but just using an L mask a planes in
brush and blending it into the
transition shade came out when's clean
way promotions nice and long and product
does warm up and moves when you need it
then when I'm with a smaller brush by
Illamasqua
and I'm going to drag the product
underneath the eye and then buff it out
again with the blending brush there now
going in with Coco bear by makeup geek
and I'm just going to go over the
transition shade which is the lighter
color we use and I'm just going to blend
out that dark brown gel is a little bit
more on top and underneath as well
again nice long motions with your brush
this is as a weave a blending brush
again I'm making sure it's nice and
blended right up to the brow then I'm
going on with corrupt which is a
beautiful black by makeup geek really
really pigmented and I'm just using a
little movement
little waiter product just to build up
the depth on the lids and then dragging
that underneath again then I'm going to
miss my concealer brush from when I did
my foundation and I'm just cleaning up
any edges making sure it's nice and
blended this is double your pencil by a
steel order and coffee and I'm gonna go
right along the waterline with ice just
to darken it up a little bit mascara
this is a Chanel mascara we sample add
on your lashes this is El Dora and heat
one one one nice and wispy get them
stuck on and that is the finished look
