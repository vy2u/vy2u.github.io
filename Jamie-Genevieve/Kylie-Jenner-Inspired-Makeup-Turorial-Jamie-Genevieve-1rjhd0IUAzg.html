channel and I hope you realize the
difference in lighting because my ring
light arrives and I be one filled with I
think it's the best thing I've ever
bought in my entire life so today's
tutorial will be less work which is
quite Kayla general inspired FM honest
same kind of smoky icing handle it
because I wish I was that cool when I
was 17
let's just say that so even though this
is Kayla genuine inspired it's a perfect
look for daytime for work things like
that I really need skin a soft natural
neutral makeup it's not a wild one and
it's the ease it's weezy takes about ten
minutes so I hope you like this tutorial
and I will be back next week with
another one for you thank you so much
for watching bye
starting off with soft or crippied mac
to paint my lid and play just a lightly
art buff so all over and a little bit
underneath as well then go down but
still i shadow by Illamasqua
this is just a really nice late tone
that I'm gonna use and my inner eye and
all for Laura let's add a little sweet
folder on my braid board for the
highlight this is a justified childhood
by Illamasqua
and I'm gonna use that as my crease
color so this is going to diffuse any
darker Browns I put on and using small
circular motions and holding my brush
quite high up just to help with the
blade zone I'm doing it quite round and
I'm going a lot but underneath is real
this is will face either by Illamasqua
which is a nice rich chocolatey brown
going in my crease Messiah and buffing
it and to justify the defusing color
using a smaller brush this time it just
to drag it under the eye probably look
more precision and then going back in
with my fluffier brush that I used first
just to make sure it's nice and softly
planted out I didn't show you it but I'm
going in with black eye shadow which is
Illamasqua at the end just to make it
nice and dark and then I go between the
crease brush and the fluffier brush just
to make sure it's mostly it diffused if
you look at pictures of Kaylee Jaina or
her eye shadows always really really
soft it's never it's never too harsh so
just a little bit of black just to give
it about dates then going on with next
jumbo pencil in milk I'm gonna pimp my
water filling to get it nice and bright
this makes the eyes look bigger and it
takes to be anything tired-looking just
make sure you poke yourself in the eye
like I do
oh this is illamasqua liquid liner and
abbess Meneses and i'm just start in
half we along the eye it's not going to
go around the fill flash light and
flaking out just a little bit not as big
as my usual it's still quite a softly
but I want it together have a slight
wing easiest way is to start on them
adult get your flick and just build up
and between the flick and who you start
out making sure the pull it's nice and
smooth and don't leave work they'll be
scared to check how you're getting oh
and halfway through
illamasqua mascara my current seeds and
I'm giving my lashes I good quarter that
a good three course or something cuz
again I feel like it oh happy super
coffin here if you put Lourdes on that's
kind of Kylie Jenner stay
I'm just popping away Peter Wesley's on
really really nice been lashes not too
strong at all you can't really tell
you've got one to be honest
and using the peerless tweezers just to
make sure the perfect and once they're
secure I give my own lashes and the fake
lashes are we're all together and
another cool mascara and that as a
finished aunt let's go on to lips I'm
using Fiera by Illamasqua a really nice
pinky nudes but it's still got a touch
of brown in it so it's not too pinky and
I'm just going straight from the billet
and applying that all over and making
sure I'm getting a good little bit
that's what sticks Matt as we all sort
of last ages and it's right on trend
this is actually a rebel brow pencil and
brown dark or brain black I should say
and I've chosen tasted this but it last
for ages on your lip with a nude
lipstick and it's sword born dry but it
lasts forever so the cause of the my
lipstick first I can see exactly for my
natural lip play nose and I'm just using
the pencil to push that out a little bit
to over a draw and although it's a lot
darker Brown or do is like I've my lips
I'll leave it up together and it helps
playing I just go back in and make sure
I get it as even as I can
my lips are quite uneven by themselves
though so I don't get too stressed out
about it when I make sure I quite like
the dark wet play with thicken it hombre
what's going on and it doesn't make them
look a lot bigger
less obviously if not I'll look for a
bit but they feel free to just put all
the lipstick like normal and a little
touch of a lipstick just in the middle
to get the Chloe simply and that's a
very spoke mighty Khan Kylie Jenner's
loose but it's suitable for daily wear
and there's me trying to pull like her
new nose thank you so much for watching
guys and I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
