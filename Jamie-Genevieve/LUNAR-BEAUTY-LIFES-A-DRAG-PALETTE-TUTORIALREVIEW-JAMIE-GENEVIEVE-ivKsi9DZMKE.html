as you can tell by the title I am going
to be using the brand new life's a drag
palette from lunar Beauty which is money
in movies brand new brand I have seen a
few tutorials using this palette already
I couldn't help myself
two of my favorites so far have to be
Kaylee mue and Robbie to Christie both
of their looks were absolutely stunning
I am really excited to show you gangstas
palette I have used that already please
it yesterday for a look didn't film it I
just wanted to play with the palette but
I am really excited to show you it today
if you'd like to see what I created then
please teach and I have already done my
foundation and whole like base makeup
because I really want to just focus on
this palette so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my lean
little Paint Pot by Mac I found it in my
drawer when I was cleaning and it's a
new one so we're gonna we're gonna be
using laying low again for a while and
I'm just gonna prep my let's this makeup
to do is super effecting because I am
actually going to see it RuPaul's work
the world tour tonight so I am going to
create a look with this palette I'm
going to call it we double drag like
it's going to be bright and colorful and
sassy and fabulous I'm not gonna be
doing and you can only block in it my
hypos or anything like that right I was
definitely going to be taking some
inspiration from the drug community I'm
going to set my lid with the hourglass
loose powder I've been using this lately
and really connect
okay so 14 shades here less section of
the palette as you're readable notes you
can old everyday readable colors and
then we've got six I would say five
these are the five pops of color here
this one here I would wear every day for
sure these five pops of color are great
I have think I've touched every single
shadow in this palette to taste
oh this shade right here is absolutely
insane it's the most beautiful golden
obsessed with it so yesterday I used the
neutral colors with this gold today I
want to go into something a little bit
more part pulse being minute since it
doesn't have purple eyes look so we're
gonna do that today the palette itself
is gorgeous you've got Manny's eyes all
done up my lipstick NIC on the front
you've got life subtract there's little
touches in this palette that I just
really like like this has raised the
back it's gorgeous this is raised here
you've got my nice handles here it's
just gorgeous
I don't know that this palette is both
vegan and cruelty free which is amazing
and shit's real wait
I think it's $45 I was really lucky to
get this in a PR package thank you so
much
I was really excited it's a noble thing
that arts okay let's get into the makeup
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm actually gonna go in with a neutral
shade on my lid
we're gonna go in with this shade
sickling first which is this gorgeous
transition shade and yesterday when I
created my look I find the shadows to be
super buttery and very pigmented you do
not need that much product when you're
working with the the kind of deeper
colors in this palette transition shades
I feel you can kind of throw in a little
bit more freedom this year blending that
into my crease like usual just again I
really like these color doing nothing to
see this next color I'm going to go in
with a pageant queen we're just going to
go in with it this one right here blown
ass purple and I'm gonna press that onto
my eye first and like I said you just
need a little bit like it's gonna use
small movements to start moving that
product around I'm just doing a little
routine of packing on and then using
this aid in the brush to start blending
the night I mean a little touch follow
but I think that's because the miss eye
I was trying to bust the product and
other than place our order then blend so
I do think that that is pretty important
as Purple's beautiful I'm just taking
another brush with a tane
touch of the park bulb you can see when
it blends out it starts a little bit
more pink which is nice I prefer this
they've a purple tablet Oldenburg boat
and I'm just taking my fluffier brush
just to go in and make sure that we're
nice and blended or I have such a nice
color I'm just going to start bringing
that onto the legs a little bit that
looks like a feel smokey eye and I've
only use one color which is good and I'm
just gonna bring that intense this into
the crease a little bit and then I'm
going to use my fluffy brush to start
moving the shape a little bit blending
out past my bro okay I'm actually going
to go in with the dark brown color it's
called muck I'm going to go in with
another dance brush and I'm just gonna
apply that no no no not no not take it
back to get back it's not dark enough
I'm actually the one with the black this
is shady I'm gonna use the morphe in
5:07 with the shady black shade and it's
gonna start
yeah that's pretty I'm just gonna start
darken your not this over corner putting
that onto the lash lines lately that
always gives a really nice smoky effect
I'm just really taking my time with the
black because that is quite a scary
shower door because things can get real
dark real quick and really gently moving
it around back in with a fluffy brush
and that purple shadow and then of
already I've actually big under my eyes
today so if I get any followed I can
just take my brush and blend away but
I've maybe recommend doing your eyes
first if you're going for a super
colorful look I'm gonna go in with the
gold shade mode which is stop pretty so
it's called a legend OD but this shadow
is really soft so I'm just gonna let Pat
and pick up some and then spring it with
my queen of Hungary mess because I
literally dosed my life in that stuff
already just gonna we're gonna fit out
I'm gonna go right up to
like oh I just love it absolutely love
it and it's my favorite color at the
whole palette and I'm going to bring up
cannot up and over the crease so when
you open your eye and still see it above
the crease because I really do want the
shadow to stand out I'm just going to
miss the black and placing it on and
then we're just gonna blend the edges so
I've just made it a little bit more
intense by pressing the black on I'm
able under my eye with the purple no
with a little line canbus eat or eat
brush and I'm just gonna stand put it
along with the whole lower lash line and
then I'm going to go in with just the
bull lack on the very outer corners of
the lower lash line just to tie in to
the top I'm going to dinner as get elope
of Lehner action on the goal I'm not
gonna do a waiting because her eyeshadow
Luca Julie window I'm just gonna bring
it to here and then blend that out this
is black and something that can give
your eyes that nice my cat eye effect if
you elevate the liner at the end to meet
with the kind of smokey eye and just
because of the gold Schuyler I'm gonna
go over a couple times just to make sure
it's solid black
once the liners on you just get your
black shadow and blend the end of the
liner and with the eye shadow in a
corner I want a real pop of brightness
just because the look is so dark and
intense so I'm going to take my Tarte
Amazonian clay waterproof liner and wait
we're just gonna create that names braid
in a corner I'm gonna take the KA pua
highly palette number one I actually
have this on all over my face and I'm
going to highlight my inner corner with
this one right here
time for mascara and lashes these aren't

care of him the
are my pits I'm going to glue these up
and stick them on fart mascara I'm going
to use the superhero it cosmetics

to dry off a little bit I'm just going
to highlight my browbone with their cup
ouple be just for a little added Sutton
some I'm going to put on the Urban Decay
heavy mantle in Midnight Cowboy this is
my favorite color and I'm just gonna put
it in the center of that's kind of gold
shadow we've created and I'm gonna bring
it up oh yeah that's perfect
I'm gonna bring it up slightly I just
felt like there was a better texture
messing and this looks and I'm just
gonna pack that glitter with an
eyeshadow brush which just disperses it
a little bit more now for some bottom
mascara I only shirt off camera really
quickly and finish off my eyebrows lips
and freckles pretty much all I've got I
have to do it and I'll be right back and

finished look I just got up and I had a
wonder I had to go get my lipstick in my

this eye makeup on so for this look I've
wanted to use these yesterday right and
then today I used this purple here I had
a little play with these other colors so

bit crazy but I remember when my knee
