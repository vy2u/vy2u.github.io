I am going to show you how to get this
filled skin look I am a huge fan of
luxury makeup for sure it's my favorite
in the world
I love expensive makeup and really
really just tie any comfort of a little
bit so I had the idea of Canada in a
like a high-end various videos and in a
more drugstore business videos so today
I'm going to show you how I get my boy
Phil coverage long last and FedEx or my
foundation and my base using Oh what
should we make up and then I'm going to
do the same thing but a drugstore
version as well so let me know what you
think about this book in a series I'm
planning and I hope you guys like it I'm
excited to challenge myself and getting
the same results high-end a drugstore so
yeah if you'd like to see her actually
it's kinda like in stitches
let's do this I think I'm going to do it
and I'm going to hydrate my skin and
this is just a little some fiber I do
have the suicides as the killed iris
extract activity too much acid so yep
1 2 3 4 drops now you don't actually
isn't a taller and it's not see them
it's an air sense and it makes your skin
something crazy like a thousand times
more hydrated but anyway it just draws
all moisture asserted it keeps you nice
and hydrated and I've been using it
every day some tired a little facial at
peels which is great what if you
continue in a little bit because this
batter is just awesome above I will use
my oil so that said my
Delia trying concentrate you guys know
that I love this so much I get that and
we want to see good warm up and then
I'll push it into my skin and that's
just brightens everything up to get
everything looking nice and smooth I
think it's all my favorite things are
use every day now what we're gonna do it
and I'm going to pop on my Charlotte
Tilbury wonderful I'm used I said a
couple of ideas before it but I just
really liked it I think get really
beautiful into the skin so I'm just
gonna
my thighs are obviously critical for
oils and my actions underneath a good
one super smoothly and it just makes
everything look super Gloria needs I
really like it and I think it does
change through your sewing base and
quite a bit obviously you guys know me I
like I really do
moisturize beads I'm not talking on the
mat lips just because I've always been
can i tall that more hydrated and more
connect always going to be younger for
longer that's what I need Amelie
okay next I'm going to use the X matrix
of CC cream your skin Bob Baker this is
the fill covers creating team I have
this decently individual but it's really
really far great and I love it so much
but see for me a CC cream
I always think would be cheaper than a
foundation but it's actually I think
it'd be feels really very surprised I
don't get to and then I hit two pumps on
the back of my hand and then I just dot
at all mercies evenly so it's just going
to help when it comfortable and just
going to help everything blend nicely
once that is on I'm going to take the
brush that comes with our product which
is the X matrix CC skin perfecting brush
this is the number seven or two love it
I've been using it regardless of what
foundation I'm using I'm just going to
give that an extra little Pat and I need
to get more Windell
so I'm just get that pattern that and
Kamisha it's going to cover everywhere
and then we'll use circle so what this
what's this covered and I will see that
last time I did not understand how it
matches me this well you don't mean I
know some people get cool so when you go
from ellipse bum so I have to do it and
not only does this product lit create it
away and it blends really easily but one
time I was going out and I already had a
kind of little mess on and I just added
another little touch on top and it
builds four wheels and my foundation
with social privilege and perfect I just
loved it so yeah I think it was my new
favorite fill full coverage foundation
and also cause it much
not to use okay okay next one when does
my favorite shape tape obviously I love
this stuff so much the sheet I use a
species like I used to associate medium
weight but I rather that I had this one
so start a business
honestly I actually prefer using this
you'd like but I've seen came I am quite
fear and woman I don't have any food
paranoid which is going to change real
soon let you see that yeah it is great
so I just use my stock underneath and
then honestly after my eyes first today
I just use a little bit concealer
underneath my eyes and then a bullet I
can blend up towards the eyeshadow in
and that way you get you can keep that
nice blade you know I'm going to swap my
brush and I'm going to actually use the
Urban Decay diffusing highlighter brush
this is a nice can I do a fiber brush
and I'm going to use it to blend
initially it now board again with my
friend Asian brush so that just gives it
a bit more precision and get rid of to
my baby sink with that and I'm actually
going to swap back to my excellent
Express to do most of this blending just
let get the job done so quickly and I do
like to thread a CC cream in brush
rather than a blue tea blender which is
so funny but true and then once I've
kind of got this creamy looking line I'm
going to use this brush now and that is
so coverage illness and then I'm just
going over it with my foundation brush
which Hill has a little bit of the X
matrix on it
but I thought palette I used to be is
actually the Too Faced sweet peach
palette so I don't just toilet it and
you would like to see her actually is my
I like to let you know I pretty much got
this kind of eye tutorial on my channel
already early
long live away it must be really really
late sheet here I'm going to use that to
set the concealer it just by eye shadow
and it also just helps it kind of blend
a little bit better that seamless so the
program will use and the reviews this
brand until recently and it's only cause
I have this powder I've been using it
this is shelter charlie poser and its HD
perfect composure and all my god
no I've governess with crme tank with em
company's done in London and it gave me
isomer like from what I heard about but
just try it because it's really really
sometimes that can be really don't say
much all of it as beautiful so I just
get covered up in my brush and I just
cannot I lose it and literally nothing
done that but I thought we could use
different the smoothness it gives your
skin and it tasty obviously so it just
looks unreal it makes you look sleep in
here brush all of that smash a famous
Bentley oh and yeah don't heart about
that guys I like it down below
anyway see check it and I looked up
after giving it create its Craig
expensive dog food but if you agree here
and you're like luckily makeup like me
it's unreal
the next I'm going to do is I am going
to use my dark tarmac bronzer you guys
know that I really like that I used to
use all the time and I'm looking quite
course teachers know just of course
every since or school coverage I'm going
to use my Charlotte Tilbury powder and
sculpt brush and we started it back and
I'm just going to kind of carve it a
cheap was a little bit and just warm up
my face and general 5008 I'll bring up
to my forehead and just not as much for
that but I do just warm up the Cana I
don't know I was funniest here like ever
so I just kind of rub it in here and
then I like to go just under my chin
make sure this is super blended look
this is how you end up getting a loo
like a ring round your neck and that
goes goes the illusion of one change
pretty good long and then I'm just going
to get hang a little bit on this brush
and we're going to board in a favor and
ORS
wait up to the start of the brow and you
can see that this kind of gives a little
bit more definition obviously again
cause reviews such capsule coverage
products your nose can just get lost in
your face a little bit but brush then
it's going to good day my name is a lot
of that blue and I just
sure that there's not going to be any
trees lands okay now that we're
professionally bronzed
I'm going to go in with my candy corn
sculpting powder and the shared medium

Severson a nice little bit less I think

little bit of EFT and I just use it rate
of the backs of my Bruins great and the
whole of my cheekbone that I've made
note that sculpted okay I've got usually
use too much blush but when I do it I
really like the tart relaxes it Allen

Terrenas and that it next I'm going to

t-shirt and I'm going to use my pure
medical mess hydrate and set and we'll
use our ceremony left-leaning to shake
