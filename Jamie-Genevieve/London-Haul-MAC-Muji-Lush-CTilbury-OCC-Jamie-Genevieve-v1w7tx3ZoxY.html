much of everything and I got past oh I'm
starting a detox and I sit just arrived
why what on that later hi guys welcome
back to my channel I have been a busy
girl I went down to London last week to
work shoulder mask on counter and I
managed to max out my credit card
Chim Chim full I'm sorry if you're
watching mum but it happened so I
thought what we do is go through
everything that I purchased because it
is all the way completed of course
because I can't spend my money on much
ills and I'm going to get some really
good bits from lush as well
there are loads in addition so I'm not
going to go through everything but you
can only get washed products I bought
the things I got from lush Ireland
addition to Oxford Street but you can
also get them on the wash kitchen which
is part of their website where the make
products that are exclusive and they
seal them in batches so it's me saying
if you do want to pick up some the stuff
I got so let's get started the first
thing i Gor it's lovely
first thing I thought was I went to the
mattress store so the my clothes store
there's only two in London at the moment
but I signed up as a Mac Pro bimbo and I
bought the briefcase travel freelance
ket okay so this is right here and it's
full of my lush stuff but you open it up
like a briefcase and it's gone amazing
like mesh pockets on this side three
different big sections it's got I really
need a little bit here which you can
actually hopefully fill that talking but
I've just got gonna like this stuff that
came way and then another
another site and in these enemies a
little plastic hose that you can remove
and they just build club rockin so it's
amazing for having your kit right here
and open and all you have to do is fill
it up and stuff city lake and kind of
like my foot although so I just thought
it was super cute it was only a hundred
pounds but as a micro member you get 35%
off so I got it for 65 which is
unbelievable it's amazing so you just
step it up and it's really neat really
neat tidy and Archer just looks like a
critics bags for your nose and then on
this side here you've got a slot that
you can use for your Zuka so if you have
a Sukkah you can explore the handle of
the zoo come over here then it just sets
on top here as you've coated nice but I
actually think you could probably fit
enough stuff that I feel freelance job
in here um okay treating myself to that
I love it I love it to watch next
and I went to Muji obviously and I got
myself and I've already put stuff in it
obviously because I can wait it was too
excited and I got there two drawers
saying that you can lift up the top so I
haven't on my other two drawers and
those drawers you can wash up the top so
you can kind of meet your own like
drawer say I thought it was super cute
and the bottom I'll just put all my
elements or I just put all my LM asking
lipsticks and then my lipsticks for
Hanes and get my lap mags that sit
collections window so when we got
betaine
sinful in a couple of pages I go to
everyday for the mask out and talk but I
got that I think that was a bit 16 poems
but Alex sort of just so hot right now
just beautiful I can show I was really
on the bad dragon for that in I also got
really cute little drawers like this and
these are only like three pens each and
you can just kinda like organize your
makeup
basically so I'm putting that in my Alex
drawer but I keep my makeup in and you
can see more on that in my last makeup
organization does your back oh my god
has come so far since then so just more
things like that it's really easy to
store your your makeup head so I got
three different sizes are going to
larger than me doing the small for now
because I don't want to buy tons and
then not use them so I've done that or
you put my stuff in it more from eg oh I
really should organize Lords of little
parts I think these really 158 but
they're amazing for freelancers or if
you've gone on holiday and you don't
take you like a big foundation like it
you can just like fill a little jar so
I've got five of those and I go these I
don't know why but I absolutely love
notebooks
I love stationary so I go a notebook
that's just got laying pages in it for
video ideas blog ideas and money stuff
because I'm really bad money I'm going
to try it right let's see how that goes
next I'm going to do the makeup stuff
first I'll save lush for last there's a
lot so I went to Charlotte Tilbury cuz
we don't have a shower Charlotte Tilbury
in girls school and we always working in
Selfridges you can see Charlotte Tilbury
and coat Awards be beautiful it's what I
want my house to look like and about
three things from Charlotte Tilbury I
got Bond girl lipstick which is one of
the matte lipsticks which I was reading
yesterday gorgeous absolutely beautiful
color and quite Kylie Jenner if she was
to read a bit of norton nudes but in one
of a kind of panky but the Pegman is
beautiful and it smells gorgeous Israel
packaged in rural schools like come on
strong and my new favorite lip liner is
from Charlotte Tilbury is called the lip
cheat reshape and resize lip liner which
obviously means for people to overdraw
your lips me and this color as iconic
notes and I've got it on today
it's amazing it's really tacky so see
once you've done one liter of it and you
go over it again and so tacky and
doesn't budge at all so it's amazing for
overdraw in it but it's just the most
beautiful really nude shade just this
one here I'm sorry I'm really far away
but the giveaway knows more
I'm not giving in here the story in
beautiful notes and then I've used both
of those already I couldn't wait and
then I got color chameleon color
morphing eye shadow pin so not like fan
eye shadow pencils I thought but the
girl who served me was so lovely I think
she's actually banjo there and she was
just great she was also helpful and this
is color chameleon bronze garnet for
green eyes I have green eyes I don't
know whether she like knew that or not
but actually does color anyway and oh
it's amazing out of pin so but once it's
on your eye doesn't come off doesn't
come off and the way she was waiting it
was I think she draw it all over the lid
and then went on on top was like a kind
of plumbing shadow and it just looked at
me so I look the best so very excited to
use that in mm-hmm I go OCC lip tar
never had one of these before really
really nice it's quite a lesson quick
glossy I thought they were mad but when
I put it on yesterday they where it
wasn't explore see I think I should have
probably got to look tarmac because
that's my jam but it's beautiful really
nice color this is called malian and
yeah really cute quick small but cute be
nice on top of my nude lips I usually do
and I treat myself as your Beauty
Blender cause I actually don't have when
I've been using the diora one which is
roughly but everyone says there is no is
based so I bought that not try to it I
will report back to you in
I went to the LMS car and big Street
which is a standalone store and I go so
much stuff for my cat so much that I
don't really want to show you all but
for all your makeup artists out there I
will let you know what foundations at go
on I mean come on Saipan so colors I go
for my cats where that's nine got myself
a little foolishness wheel and I go seed
wine which is right I got 3.5 which is
one of the most popular shades for
Alaska foundation I got my escape clause
of shades because you can really mix
your shades with white to make a lighter
shoots or ice cap go to the light shades
and then I just went for it which is a
nice pinky tone 11 which is a deeper
pocket one which is really good for
people that tan but not baloney times
you don't mean like in a more of like a
British tan so the 11 skirt 12 fake
tanners you will love that and then I
got 14 which is really good for our
candlestick or super dark so when I was
reading tan for a while
I will 14 Mexico and it was divine
beautiful old brow gels and I actually
have a pro tail on to do both so with
eye shadow on top it's good it's very
good huge list posix this base is paid

moment
gently bitter little heaved but this it
just smells gorgeous
you've got jasmine and rose petal and
fuchsia and while the Jews and lavender

really floral but it's like why citrusy
kick and bergamot oil is just really

gorgeous dark purple and it's actually
the Pegman tape this is a here peg
Mentos same step form so it's much
easier to apply because the packaging
