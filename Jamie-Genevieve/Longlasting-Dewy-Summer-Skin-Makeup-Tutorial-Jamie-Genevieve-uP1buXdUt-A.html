week I am going to go through skin again
I thought I've looked at my YouTube but
I don't actually have that many kind of
foundation tutorials or anything so a
lot of the products are at the same as
my last vacation routine but that's
because I think what works for me and I
love it
but there's a couple of new things that
there's a couple of new techniques and
need as well so what I'm going to do
this week it's hoped to get that super
goof a nation that it's going to last
you'll be it's a quail at the time when
you have a jury finished your skin
actually does feel weight to touch and
that means that it can slip it can fall
it can say for eternity I have been
trying running this make up this kind of
routine all week and it lasts it lasts
in this skin my skin doesn't know
anything
I feel genuinely upset when I have to
keep my makeup off in the night because
it looks so good so I'm going to share
with you my tricks and tips on how to
achieve a jury finish a sun-kissed cool
for spring and summer that's going to
last you so what I hope you like this
video I'm sorry I don't have a puppy to
show you because he is sleeping at with
Jack just know he is tired he was a
rascal or morning I've been up since 6
o'clock my god for makeup that's all I'm
going to say I hope you like this video
I don't we'll see you next week with
another one oh so clean skin slightly
sporty here I tried in a fiendish you
know and it completely broke my skin but
let's not talk about that let's not be
negative
I start my face off I've already
moisturized with my lot of moisturizer
vanishing cream and I really went with
effect spice oh I've obviously done at
my brows and my eye makeup first I
always do that because it's much easier
to clean up their eye makeup and render
play when you don't have your foundation
on and I think it's easier for a stag
one No mm-hmm
when there's no foundation on first it's
definitely easier to do your face before
you to your foundation I've sprayed my
face with fixed price and I my
friend Chanel give me less to try the
leblanc additional base Lamia of
universal multi-use illuminating base
I'll speak French
I've used this once before and for a
Jewish guy there's nothing better
it's beautiful you'll need to tell you
kneel over Israel like this much and it
just completely eliminates your skin and
she said something about it at kind of
smoothing pores and you just made this
even I've got a break from rubbing my
face but that's me
I am a woman my eyebrows to do feeling
but I do finish I don't think you can
get variants can be I used to be
everybody though and with excess trainer
I'm just gonna put the foundation on top
I'm using the color it UX actually you
can buy it in the shop you cannot buy it
and account or unless you go to a
standalone stores but you can get it
online and if for all you people that we
were 8.5 it's just slightly more busy
nice it's really nice and then doing
rich strokes
don't rush books and obviously I'm not
the my chair because this happens why
would Adam ellipse we're able to get the
new smell over them and even though I'm
doing jury I suppose I'm not going in
with as much product as they usually use
but I'm still going to use a fair amount
summer it's not that summer here you
mean
cold and for all of you that are not to
sing my nails loosen I've got a date
with Tracy today I've got a date with
notorious nails and I buy whatever
wunderbar so you can see that citation
itself is really jewy
anyway you see when you don't use powder
it's quite um shiny
beautiful gorgeous education then I'm
going to take my Beauty Blender the real
one that I bought and one day which is
amazing it's worth the money and sex
flights and then I'm just going to go
over foundation not everywhere just in
their metal base and then I need more
coverage over my spots seriously though
I've not broke out into the wick 15 and
that's when da schon ruins my skin
looking shiny now it for it next bit I'm
going to be using my Mac dark tan
mineralized skinfinish my favorite
brands because they're dark and his
Weaver looks this defeat her face
brushes on the planet and we litter my
bronze are first and I'm not going to
use as much as I usually use it could be
a fresh corn - what's the hue like walls
okay little bit over Joel a little bit
up here my my forehead forehead okay I'm
happy with that it's not too strong
which is great but Judy for me means
blowing the sage so that's what we're
gonna be doing oh no for my home league
I'm going to be using a Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and NC 20 and boots winter so
pump pen to pump to that concealer in
the back of my hand and this is what
I've been doing lately and I are quite
late care and then think I like the
concealer but I do going with peatlands
out and I'm just gonna okay now do a
lane like that
right up under the eye and then doing
the doors onto the forehead Tom what a
name I'm gonna draw a lane underneath
the contour so like that
I love that so easy spin the world and
they blade
okay so know we are Don's unhighlight
head I mean no use any poker game
we're gonna break in a highlight what
I'm going to use as my deflected page I
actually have a tiny little bit and here
in my eyes and it's makeup geek
afterglow I mean come on so beautiful
going on with my Luck's highlight brush
using a brush brush jolt me then I'm
gonna dip that in the highlight and
apply oh my god that's beautiful
that's the most I've ever seen in my
life
so shady and now that the skin is done
adds a little bit of lipstick because
I've gone for quite a glam I I am just
going to do a little it as always better
to use lipstick by the way from Ella
mask Oh pretty much the base it's nude
lipstick that's out there if you agree
please tweet the comments below so I can
go and try whatever lipstick you think
because my eyes are so heavy Israel and
the focus is more on the skin I am only
gonna fit a little bit of that later on
I'm not going to over draw them as much
as I usually do so I'm at the lip liner
I've just used as Lipchitz by Charlotte
Tilbury and the color iconic nude and
it's my favorite lip liner about it's
already half sharpened it only goes if
it wasn't London okay so I'm gonna
finish it there I don't get paranoid my
skin is on the oil inside but the cause
I use a powder highlight and the areas
that I get oily I feel like that stays
for makeup it's still backwards but a
powder I show you how to say and really
do want to go shiny kind of thing but I
think real well we all real more
ho-ching a lengthy so if you are oily
and you really don't want to get wavy so
even though you do want to refinish
powder just here just the metal
leave all this with all your highly on
and it's a really easy
sneaky me
I'm making your skin look jewy but
actually using powders to do so so it's
not actually going to be weight to touch
and like cream as we sit on this skin
they don't say because you're using a
powder to highlight L last much longer
I've been child running this you may
have seen on my Instagram how its Jani
and these days I do look between soft
and gentle and this but I do find that
that s goes to such a dramatic shame
this is the after cool pigment by makeup
geek I'll link it down below so you can
go and have a look for yourself but you
can use the integrant on your eyes on
your cheeks area you probably got a lot
on your lips as well beautiful but I
like how reflective this pigment is so
see for me for someone who wants a
really severe highlight that is methane
