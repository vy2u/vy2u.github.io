here today to talk about all the things
I bought in Manchester saw me and my
boyfriend went down we drove down from
Glasgow to my chest I through the
blizzard that was Thursday morning and I
we made out for dinner and drinks and we
stayed and the I went to McDonald's
hotel which was lovely
it was really really nice we got a
beautiful room on the 7th floor a huge
huge be like triple king-sized or
something beautiful view really central
Israel was really easy to drive to so
they had a car park and everything and
heard it for dinner and the next day we
went to the Trafford Centre so if you've
not been to the Trafford Centre before
it's a huge big show up and saying I
wear more shops than we have in Glasgow
so I was very excited and unfortunately
I had a few too many cocktails so I
wasn't in the best shopping mood so I
picked up a few bits when I was back and
guys what I was planning to get in
Manchester it so I'm gonna talk about
those as well so let's get started
here some bugs so obviously itself 4js
had to go a lavish even the mob hurry I
smelled that and I was like no I need to
go in I need to go in I needed to get
stuff anyway I'm obviously not makeup
really it but hey so start actually
start off with the Victoria's Secret so
first thing I got was a beautiful
leopard friend
makeup bag so this is quite a small one
this is sixteen pounds and but I just
think it's nice for just having in my
hand but I could seal to be basic idea
boat with me because usually my makeup
DeShawn's free in my bag I've got things
like a lighter in the bottom of my
handbag so I thought I could keep them
on there - leopard print I can't resist
flavor print I mean like it's permanent
it's permanently on my body and people
love it people hate it I love it and
obviously
I got some pants but I'm not gonna show
you them I got some pants they do a deal
that's like five pairs for 20 poem
talked about them also gone I don't know
if you've ever seen these actually again
leopard print these are the comfiest dog
bottoms
I've ever had in my entire life I have
been living in them since I came home
nearly a week ago I think that the best
things ever so that's why I got
Victoria's Secrets and I went to Muji
like I said that was going to it and I
got a little it's called just a portable
keys but these things are amazing for
your cat if your makeup artist like me
and you've got tons of lipsticks this is
like a case it's just plain but you can
put your lipsticks and then I already
got one and my cat that I use and but
that it means an even just for you to
release as well if you've got like
millions of lipsticks and you don't know
what when to use or where they all I pop
up in my knife you can either melt them
or you can just come out smooth them in
I was gonna say smear as a hold of a
ward and so yeah they'd only like 250 or
something and I or a unit so this thing
is meant for glasses I think you're
meant to have a stand unless we're meant
to put sunglasses in it but in my friend
Kara she has one and she keeps her
pencils in it and I just think I was
amazing because the unit that I've got
and saved my storage like makeup storage
it's very shallow so all my pencils are
purple a note
so I'm winning you stairs I mean I think
I might just take the drawers out and
have them say by sight and then I'll be
able to use that unit for palettes or
something so love that I think that was
about 25 pound and I went to Mac in some
features as well and and lovely girl
served me and I actually watches my
videos so if you're watching thank you
so much for your help
I'm sorry about my rubbish makeup sanity
and so I've got two things from Mac I
got the NC 20 pro longwear concealer I
have seen so many makeup artists use
this for highly and so I'm gonna I'm
gonna give that a go cause it's liquid
Israel I think it me
every bit different for me so I'm gonna
try that I will show you the color
actually not much point just show you
the box is it so that's it there glass
bottle and the color is anti 22 it is
too late for me but I like my concealers
been really very late but that stuff's
really sturdy apparently and it lasts HS
or under the eye it should be good and I
go a blush higher from the new
collection I've been loving the
highlights I called perfect all thing
I've been using out all the time so I
went got a blusher from the same range
in this one's called uplifting and it's
just got our mineralized blush very
bronzy which I like obviously it's
actually quite quite early which is good
obviously coming into spring somewhere I
steer away from all the deep tones I've
been using that's it there so I just
love this show unit you get off these
products stunning um actually I went to
Paper Chase we've got one of these in
Glasgow but I am a total sucker for
liking these pains and things so I
thought the best games I've ever seen in
my life it's like gold and I don't if
you can see that but it's a little skull
a little skull on the top it's just a
bee twist pain so that's great because
I'm always got a diary I'm always great
in a variety and stuff and I'm always
using crappy paint support for free so
that's an exchange and I don't know if
you watch our about my friend Kate and
her blogs called ghost parties and she
doesn't know Vale daily as well
she loves at washi tape and she's been
doing some really cute things with washi
tape really candle holders and I just
thought well she's he really because I'm
loving every and if I just though for a
second like full
the wall and stuff so I'm sure you'll
see me posting on Instagram every these
but I thought they were super cute so
I've got like a black one with gold
polka dots and a pink one because who
doesn't love pink no I'm fighting
through those I went to boots and I go
well this is actually in grad school but
would a potatoes in Manchester but I got
some things from soap &amp;amp; Glory so leave
that 3/4 - so I got the fast
mascara wet it just got cold as you know
so I don't know who that does for your
lashes but I'm sure it's gonna be
dynamite
it's called film noir so it's really
black and tube the bullet is a gold saw
I'm a fan I like that and let's have a
look at the brush nice nice and chunky
but still nice and defined as rails so
I'll give that a go and report back but
I think it'd be nice and I got the
kick-ass concealer I hadn't actually
heard anything about this and I just
opened it before I started recording
this and I like it like it comes like
those and then you open it and then and
on the top I thought that was a
concealer and I was like are you kidding
me on a beach or I got the meteor one
and that it's wait but it's not photo so
you get a little powder we put above and
underneath you have Twitter potato
concealer so I think this one here is
for under eye brightening I can see me
isn't that room I've always thought and
in this when you hear is just for your
face so that may be nice just for
blemishes and stuff never to go at them
um but I'm gonna try that with my brows
cuz I fire through my concealer I'm
using my brace actually I'll do a swatch
for you oh it's quickly man peachy
Israel so peaches always good with
concealer because it left any darkness
if you've got dark circles underneath
and that left so that's the under eye
brightener and okay so the under eye
brightener is quickly made the face ones
a wee bit tacky our eye it's very thick
and that's that they're quite warm too
and I can't see like I think it will
suit me fine but I can't see everyone
sitting there very warm in there
you've got your little poder just to say
thank nice and the last be back I got
from supreme glory was Wonder bronze so
I go through bronzer like nobody's
business and this one is just like Shama
black so Felix you've got your dark toys
you've got your kind of Goldie and you
put your highlight and tone as well and
I'm pretty sure it yeah you can actually
use what color you want if you know what
I mean but I'll just be doing a little
swirl and I'll see you in space oh very
shiny very Mac mineralize I'm feeling so
that would be good and from boats I also
got know one of my clients actually told
me about their sharpener its body aim
it's only 2 pounds I've already used
that because I couldn't find a sharpener
my necks back pencils jungle pencils but
Faton and it's my sign is really good
it's very sharp
it doesn't break your pencils and at
least I'm super SuperDuper sharp and the
same client actually recommended me to
get the Rimmel blow pencils so what I
use from a place just there I'm really
happy with it so a mask a thunder and
blow kick but she says that these
eyebrow pencils are really good they're
really they're really really pigmented
so this is the black brown one so it's
about too dark for me but I can see me
maybe using it just towards the end some
of those could I have no here but if you
look it's like super dark and really
really tak Israel so you're actually
doing it for looks Robert which is
refreshing kind of quite a lot of blow
products you it looks nicely then here
it's like fresh air there's nothing
there and Anna last week back I go up
from this wise tweet this is my groom I
know it goes tweezerman skincare tool so
this is one of the crazy metal gadgets
that has little loops in it that you
praise against like your blackheads and
whiteheads and it just they pop the
globe without you having to ruin your
face with your Neil's so yeah I'm not
gonna wear I've tried it already let's
missing
it's all good and we've got two
different ends but I've been using the
flat ends and see just the little bumps
that get on my skin I'll actually just
push down and pull and it all comes out
amazing
so that's fine that's good fun and
family lush so I got a few things I
always do I got the intented egg cream
perfect for a day or a night perfect day
or night and and this has tons of oils
it's got honey in it its core lavender
Louisville which we know is really
killing for this kind almond oil place
that one's oil as well so it's really
concentrated so I think this is going to
really really hydrate my eyes and
because obviously the sky merchandise is
for it personally you need to be careful
with what you put there and I actually
didn't have an eye cream at all so this
is fab I'm excited to start using this
and I go rub rub rub because I don't
know
and I because the hotel Laura seen and
had a humungous bath I feel like I
wanted to pamper so rub rub rub as a
shower scrub and it's got this blue it's
beautiful tons as he sold that's what
makes it really super scrubby if you
like a gentle exfoliation it's not for
you but well you could use it in the
shower I suppose but I put on dry skin
and they're not going to show and wash
it off and it literally leaves you saw
smooth and a fragrant blossoms scented
sea salt scrub for your body and here if
you want backbone see here use this in
your hair but I just love it it smells
like cherry blossom you know it smells
really really fresh and I got this
because I took one with me this is a
bubble bar
I took one Metheny and I use the fill
thing in one bath and it was genuinely
one of the best bass of my entirely this
one here I this would be my favorite
since I was a kid I love this thing oh
my Dave
it smells like black pudding blackberry
raspberry ripple it's the best it's
absolutely terrible and see if you use a
fear dose of it it leaves your skin so
smooth
and I got one for my mom
because I used home so I was like
alright and this is very much the same
thing but it smells like it's what he's
getting to be my favorite I don't know
it smells like freshly peeled oranges
it's super fresh but these ones cause
they're so big you can use them in four
baths and one of my customers was
actually tell me that she greets at like
a cannon and keeps it in a tub and just
sprinkles a little bit and every bath
and it lasts her age a sore alright say
that that's not mean I like to get that
tomorrow and I got one more Bubble Boy
it's just funny safe so it smells by
except to see and again it was actually
a custom an Iranian that told me ready
set this like super clarity and she said
that she used the pink one which is
called the comforter Saudi the orange
ones called bright side as well this
one's called sunny sides and it smells
crazy or dingy again but she said she
put half of this in a bath along with
half the confirmed the pink one and she
said it was based match never heard her
life so obviously I had to co-op here
and I'll I'm very excited about using
him bath team has never been so fun and
my last thing I got from lush was
something I've had a few dates before
this is called haughty and it's a
massage but so this one is actually for
they could sore muscles and the giant in
my chest hit him back ruins my back it
was so sore
newly released there and this massage
bra has black people in it so it's heat
saw almost it does it feels like it
heats up and it just uh not your muscles
and the shape of it really helps as well
cuz it's got little fun I'll show you
just like this smells beautiful it's got
black paper it's called as I am vanilla
and it as well so it's create a sweet
one but these bones what you're meant to
do is get your skin and you rub it on
like that and the bum some massage as
well and because of the heat of your
skin it melts and it leaves just getting
it courted and there's a beautiful oily
moisture
he's um Oliver even if I wasn't sort of
pick that all over my body anyway so and
it leaves just getting up with any
Sheena's be able to see if he record I
you wanted kind of shiny skin it's the
dream come true and oh one more thing
from the forgot about a baddie in I'm
not used body him since I was like 14
but I went into boots and my friend Rose
where he goes Colleen and she told me to
go and have a look at those so I'm going
to actually watch it that's when it's
cold seven four one six not for all
right all sounds not for the eyes but
I'm definitely fit every my but I got
really like her usually would this is
actually stunning it's such things
colored as well and it was willing like
face bones like hey lovelies that even
just think for a spot like I or I'm sure
you could use that as a highlight Israel
if you just use a little bit of it but I
think that's beautiful
so it's pinky with a kind of silver
shimmer through it yeah we can or with
other swatches lovely so that is what I
got from Manchester
I was really charged and I did spend on
me but it's better for your back I'm on
you but the most exciting thing that I
bought recently I'm gonna go home for my
chance that I've wanted this for so long

18-inch delay so every all my favorite
