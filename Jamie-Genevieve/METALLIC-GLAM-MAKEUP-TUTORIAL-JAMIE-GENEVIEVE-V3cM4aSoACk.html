I am showing you how to use the next
metals palette come on buddy
nail problems this is the next metal
palette I thought of a few guys have
sinned but I was the face of this
palette for at the latest next campaign
it was very very excited ten few of my
friends were also the face of other
elements which is great so I said let's
look for it the photo shoot and
basically I want to show you guys how I
created it and also how to use the
palette so if you would like to see how
I created this look please stay tuned
hello
we're gonna do some makeup I've got a
new setup you guys can't see it but I'm
very excited about it I basically have a
table in front of me instead of my
little trolley so I actually have space
to move okay let's just start with the
makeup so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm gonna get lay in little pink
pop I've not even besten ages because
I've actually lost it for a while how do
I stop this from driving my phone baby
so I'm just gonna put Molly and little
Paint Pot over my and basically I'm sure
you guys know that we recreate and the
makeup look that I did for the next
campaign that I'm on I basically next
brought the sex palace with six elements
and they used six of us as the models
and I metal and I was really excited
about it because male my face is filler
metal isn't it not fill that's what
that's like where my granny used to see
your face is still a male okay
underneath right I'm gonna do the matte
part first the cause I'm gonna show you
it quickly just so you understand table
set extensions so this is the next
metals palette as gorgeous this is what
I've been using they look at that so
it's a reason because all these colors
are super shimmery they have a lot of
pigment as well
let me show you the silver super
pigmented super cemani they definitely
work best over to base or used wait but
it's o shimmers so if you are the kind
of gal or guy the likes is to shower all
over and then mascara then fab I am
gonna however use a little matte palette
as well to get some dates that's what I
did on the shoot day
so we're going to do this first and the
local pilot I'm gonna use of actually
not used before but this is the next red
lingerie shadow palette oh cool I got it
when I was at the face of wars but these
are matte horns so actually just like
sex big matte eyeshadows and yeah I just
really want to try it fat Matt yeah
they're all Matt on that oh man that was
in un hey make sure I'm in focus okay so
we're just gonna start off the huge
weight and we're gonna mattify our legs
so I'm gonna take this color here I'm
just gonna chuck that on often that's
pigmented though we're just gonna chuck
that on in the primer make sure
everything's nice and matte before we
start with our darker colors easy as
that
now I'm gonna take my semester two feet
to brush and I'm actually gonna go in
worth let's shade first which might be a
bit brave because it's quite dark but
we'll just see next is eye shadows are
just ridiculous these days so I'm just
using that in my crease and then the
last product I've got the more I'm just
gonna can ever raise my brush up and
really buff that right this little pilot
handy I can see me really going for this
cradle up and my new thing is I liked it
was not nothing really but I just like
to bring out in the shadow quite far
into here I think it just makes me look
a little bit MIDI I don't have to nip I
like to look MIDI and I'm gonna do the
thing where I'll do the whole of my eyes
on top and then I'm gonna fetch my base
and then I'll do underneath my eyes
afterwards and honestly I think that's
I basically just want the shadow
therefore definition because when you
use shimmer all over your lights
sometimes it can look a little bit funny
I might just take the tiniest little bit
of this kind of burgundy shade and just
pop that right in that corner cuz I'll
use that underneath my eye so she'll
just using the same brush but I'm not
gonna put any more shadow on my actual
legs because that's where I'm gonna put
all the shimmers nice okay so the way
I'm gonna use this palette I think the
first time I use that I'd like to just
wet my brush and put it on so let's try
that first and I want to do it super
goal be super gold so I'm going to use a
little mix of this shade here and I'm
gonna pop it with this one here which is
not quite cool it's like rose gold
almost I'm gonna use these to mix
together and I'm just gonna try it use
it a wet brush I'm getting the gold on
my brush and I'm just gonna give it a
little spritz let's try that oh you can
really build these up though to get out
of italic Sheen sorry guys my voice is
going oh well mm-hmm nice and then
you've always got your other brush that
you use for your shadows your normal
shadows you can just kind of blend that
up and out now I'm going to pop at with
a little bit of this in the same time
yeah we're starting to get that metallic
and babe okay let's do the other eyes so
just again picking up the gold give it a
Skoosh and bringing that right up to the
crease cause it's such a dramatic
metallic you look I don't really care
about transferring anything I think I
had it quite high on the day
have a little look and see wasn't makeup
looks like oh yeah a super bronze I
remember I'm in this so now I'm going to
take this one right here and I'm gonna
pop my brave boy
look at that guy's a brow bone mmm cool
I just looked at the photo and I
actually went a little bit darker on the
day so I'm just gonna go end Tamela I'll
let launch it a shadow Paola again I'm
gonna go in with more of this burgundy
color that's looking a little bit more
dramatic together extra pop in the light
I'm gonna take the next glitter glue I
spoke about this before and how it's my
favorite glitter glue and it's super
cheap as well I'm gonna take that I've
also got my next gold glitter these are
again super cheap and gutter at the end
of the day is glitter so if I spend a
fortune on glitter I'm going to do is
I'm going to take a little bit of this
glitter glue and just like we used to
just dab that all over the lid and then
I'm gonna use the same brush and just go
into the glitter and just you can see
that it just gives a little added pop
and then you can just kind of tidy that
up by adding a little bit more dark
shadow and the crease keeping it math
cute now I'm gonna pop my in our corner
with the shade up in using this
highlight and for the brow bone and
stuff and what you just gonna pack it
onto a super intense it's gorgeous
do you see I'm gonna add some mascara
and lashes and mascara I'm gonna use is
the benefit roller lash and the lashes
I'm going
Arlie the lily lashes and mykonos I just
find that they're nice when you don't
have later on because you can get them
really close to the lash line still I
look so crazy top lashes gonna bolt and
watch it okay so I'm just gonna leave my
lashes to dry know that they're all
glued up and when I'm Way in when i zoom
you guys we're going to do a little bit
skin here okay so the first thing we do
is I'm going to take my chi press
antioxidant do I've been using this I'm
halfway done it's my favorite I've
actually brought her a little bit just
know though but I can almost guarantee
that that is Vegas coming over
mouthpiece
okay that is Pat lap and rub that into
my skin and then I'm gonna do my chi
press Helio tropic the ultimate save
sunscreen slash primer I've been using
this to the day I need to get
replacements in and it's a reason for a
minimal week because a Mui and sunny
please says that u s-- always forget
about sunscreen because I thought my
makeup had it in it but some makeup does
not I want to pick the skin and then
finally I'm going to apply my Kiehl's
D reviving concentrate drops and I just
use one two three to my hands and then
Pat that on and this keeps my skin super
fresh injury all day and it makes my
foundation going really smoothly and I
just love it and I only do that step if
I'm not dropping it onto my face and
mixing it with my foundation but the
foundation that I'm going to use today I
just apply the oil first and then use it
these lashes should be really been there
so my Lily lashes are pretty much ready
I'm just gonna give them a call yeah
this looks particularly crazy cuz I'm
not done underneath my eyes it but has
the
people have faith okay I'm gonna let
those lashes chill for a little second
before a squeeze them on and now that we
can get our foundation and stuff so the
foundation video is as the next custom
drop foundation no total control drop
foundation I've been absolutely loving
this I think it's probably best from
what I've heard for people with oily
skin I heard a few people saying that
they had trouble with it if they had dry
skin so I'm just gonna drop this shade
golden which is just a little touch too
dark for me at the moment I did about
two drops on my cheeks and then so you
don't say no and then I've got the shade
buff here which is a fair bit later and
I'm just gonna do there we go that
should be fine you really don't need
much of this I think I already used that
a little bit for a while I'm just gonna
buff this in and I just love it it's
been giving me really good coverage it
covers up all my redness I like the
colors
there's tons of colors on it I would
definitely go to a counter and see what
color you'd be in try out because it is
obviously super and expensive and
although people are asking me what
foundation I was waiting when I was away
this time I was in Vegas in LA and I had
s every single day I would use shape
tape what's that - like concealer under
my eyes and stuff and sometimes I said
or my face a little bit more but you
really don't need to just apply some
shapes up under my eyes and that's
concealer the shape seats in the shade
ton Sun which is again it's probably not
that perfect highlight and shade but
I've been like in just using my close to
my skin tone I don't actually gonna use
that's heart brush to buff again it
doesn't have an evil in it but it's like
a fiendish anyone hmm oh it's getting
the job done so if just buff that
concealer then I'm gonna go over my ears
a little bit much better okay I'm gonna
powder and bronze my face so I'm gonna
use my Charlotte Tilbury airbrush
flawless finish powder which is my
favorite just going under the eyes and
then I like to does go down the sides of
the mouth just kind of like hit on my
center areas and then I'm gonna bronze
my face up and I'm just gonna use my Mac
gave me Sun bronzer all tippet good day
and I'm just gonna go down my cheeks
chin and forehead it's just all the
usual areas I need to finish off - I'm
looking like a complete maniac I'm just
gonna use my heartiest clay paint liner
I'm just gonna have to paint it onto my
waterline because I cannot same hole
pencil so I'm just gonna grab some of
this with an angle brush
crisis very good it was good paint that
I don't know them oh Jesus my waterline
yeah it feels fine oh do dramatic I'm
gonna get my anger squeezed together and
it transfers on the top so you don't
need to do that pretty neat huh and
there I've done that I'm gonna take this
shady here and this shade and I'm just
gonna bump that underneath my eyes for a
little bit of definition cuz my eyeballs
looking quite small and a little bit of
that nice orange shade right there we go
it's crazy the difference that makes
and then before I do my ball mascara
I'm gonna take some more of this gold
shades and I was going to bring it
underneath the front of my eye and that
totally brightens everything up and you
get those at the metals coming right
through and then I'm just gonna build up
my bottom mascara and that is earth
completely super metallic a Goldy
shimmery green this now I'm actually
going to take the highlighting shade
again and I'm gonna highlight the face
you do not need much of this at all mmm
you see that this palette is obviously
Gorge
I would I would probably see that I use
it to add to me cups because I never
really do our whole shimmer look but you
can also use these on your face on your
body like I wouldn't even call it an
eyeshadow palette I would see it's like
a metals palette so I would totally use
these as highlighters every - makeup
artist and you've got to be really
creative work this would be fab and then
also Halloween's coming up there's
definitely some colors here that I would
use to like highlight my face say not
even you mean it wouldn't even need to
be Halloween I'm gonna highlight my nose
how cute though when I was at the photo
shoot I'll show you really quickly but
I'm not getting any but look at this I
like totally a highlight as my whole
body refers Pilate and it looked the
best
it looked so good well obviously it was
a makeup photo shoots my apology wasn't
in it I'm gonna highlight up here a
little bit healthy man and then keep
this bowl and then if you want to
connect blend your bronze and highlights
cover not gonna do any blush with this
lip you just get a little bit more
bronzer and just give it a little sweep
ruin to highlight and alright that's it
okay for lips I'm gonna take my usual
Urban Decay liar lip liner I'm just
going to lay my lips at normal
and then I'm going to take the end
Europe element lipstick which is called
metallic gold this is part of the metals
collection and I'm just going to pop
that on top now you do not need to use a
lip liner with these but I just feel
like whenever I pull ups the gum with a
lip liner I always say oh I'll just add
a little bit lip liner and then the
usual thing I do as part men I'm just
going to set my face with the only act I
like to do this I feel like it works
best ever I'm gonna go in with a little
bit more powder just cour my smile lines
