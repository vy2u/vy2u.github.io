I am going to do in make a tutorial
using this palette Jeff and Hilma see it
has been a little while since my last
tutorial so thank you so much for weird
I hear you guys are new to my channel or
if you have not seen yet we have
actually started weekly vlogging and so
if you haven't checked that out then you
did you definitely should I would love
it as you subscribe and hit a little
bell button so you cannot fight whenever
a boss and this tutorial I am going to
show you how to create the next i'll it
with the jack can help morphe palette
but I'm also going to show you how
actually in most skin and let's Andre
take much you'll see it's been a little
while since my last tutorial so I
thought I would just put all in there
for you I really hope you like it if you
would like to see how I created this
look
stay tuned I don't in a while I'm not
gonna lie I'm a little bit nervous
Thank You Samia so the first thing I'm
going to do some skincare because I'm
going to compute on so I'm going to take
my Kiehl's oil as use my dearly divided
and concentrate and we'll take four top
and just put that all love cinnamon and
I've run out of my on my shoulder I
don't really want to use another one
better case instead of using white rice
I I'm going to use my hangover primer by
Too Faced in pump of that but it was
really nice out there well since we use
that okay
repaint and I'm just going to go ahead
and do some makeup okay so I went into
my base really quickly because obviously
we're all here for Jaclyn hill palette
you'll be blender right I forgot to wait
a while for cakes in oil to thicken
wait I hate to say it your choice
because the northern Iran makes fun of
me but I'm a lot of time so meaning is
my makeup forever stick foundation and
one two three why
six five I said that's a number I'm just
going to shove that on my skin the skins
all right at the moment I've got a lot
of bit of a little bit of time
when I was in Miami so I'm not using
actually that much but my knitted the
thing actually let's try it with the
turmoil I've not done that yet I'm going
to give my tire radiance drops and this
may be a bit much but we'll we'll
probably not why not test it on YouTube
where everyone's watering I'm going to
do this angle in Instagram
hello cried what's up said or not and
that's just beautiful Enderson and I'm
not trying to before but I've been doing
that with my oil and I've actually been
just doing it with my fuel oil and it's
been so nice warm best foundation is so
good it's actually wee bit late but
we're just going to broaden that and and
this is how I've been doing a foundation
lately and Avenue elation and oil makes
it look smooth higher duty but at the
same time it kind of shears out shears
out the foundation a little bit and I
just like having a really early base
because I turned 24 I'm over birthdays
it's so strange when birthday starts
becoming the same as e-trade
but that's what happened the whole
birthday was like going to a normal day
just a normal day still 23 don't worry
nice let's do some concealer I'm going
to use my Maybelline I raise her eye and
the shade light we're just going to do a
little bit highlighted with that people
in it and and it may seem like I'm
rushing but honestly this is how I would
do my base note and it's just really
easy simple eat that was missing from
your character and yet we're is going to
be a blender send obviously that's a
little most important part of the makeup
at all
but I just wanted to do it because I
know you guys like to see traditional
screens and that is an issue of coverage
I've got some lumps and bumps on my skin
you may know it and that's completely my
fault because our pet Murphy's okay I'm
going to go Chien and claim my eyes with
Li multi imports the same P apart I use
a
really time I just get to top my Beauty
Blender and apply that link so I want to
give this eyeshadow the same fair
treatment I got all my shadows so I'm
just packing out on a I'm going to go in
with my pure four in one place metal
makeup and the shade light tan and I'm
just going to use my Smith one one two
brush to say all this goodness and go
over my eye this is exactly what I do
every day I need to change up and if you
guys are at Clayton new to my channel
well I'll be away for a little while so
I will be trying new things oh very soon
but at the moment this is what I've been
doing and this is what I like whoa
that's kind of smoking about there this
what you do get a Beauty Blender and
take some of this powder and just mark
that day nothing the Beauty Blender
can't deal with yeah I just really I do
under the curing obesity at all if I
could have done enough makeup without
putting a bezel and oh it'll mean my
beach bronzer they much loved by me
I love the top of it as well punky we're
going to bronze this all the way up
I love a broad forehead at the movement
then it's gonna Brown bring my neck
blood linic little chin and then I like
just a little touch them in as well and
the brush I'm using as my Charlotte
felony blusher brush for bronzer because
we really pray for blush I have a new
favorite blush and I picked up when I
was abroad and the states and as the
Milani Luminoso
based powder blush Milani as a drugstore
brand from mistakes but we know can get
it here I think it's on beautybay a link
it down below anyway but I'm just going
to go in with my bronzer I'm on my blush
brush but I'm going to go in with the
same brush I use for my glow and syrup
get a little cheeky smile
for highlight when I'm going to do it
right now I'm going to use the sweep
highlighting palette and solstice I've
had the fridges I've just never used it
a little wide because it is phenom so
I'm going to take this car here I mean
look at that it's ridiculous and it's a
drugstore man this is an expensive I'm
just using it my morphe don't know brush
it's worn off this one I like to just do
a little pimple I was doing that fan all
the way as well this isn't going
everyday to our little nose can you take
my luxe soft crease brush 51 x Weaver
and I'm just going to go down down here
right I'm just going to do it in middle
as well yes and then just my powder
brush just take around the edges make
sure there's no creative Elaine's and
that is actually the base I've been
doing every single day of my life for
the last two weeks so that literally
took me I think about 10 minutes and
like real life time I definitely quickly
show you guys in case you were wondering
port I've been using obviously there was
a fair few budget brands in there can
you tell about money all I'd like to do
really is my lips brows and eyes so I'm
actually going to shoot off camera I
would do my those the products I'm going
to use as my Anasazi out Beverly Hills
growing and my nose see that journal it
brightens jo'bril my new favorite blow
Jill is very safe fiber fell out by
Maybelline and the reason I like it so
much if it has this funky little brush
at first again the weird brushes are
always like why but that makes it so
it's a flat brush but it has all the
fibers of from one sites you just brush
it through your very slightly and it's
like the best so I'm going to show off
camera do my growth and one eye and I'll
be back to show you how to create eye
however we're going to use today SD
jaclyn hill morphe palette i was really
excited to get this through my post box
obviously i'm sure everyone's seen a
fire and what that leaked to the games
twenty guys who's traveling and best
jacket hells help with morphe dedicated
to all her loving subscribers and yeah
it's gorgeous
what will you try and do is I'm just
going to look at this as a parlor I'm
not going to thank too much of it whose
names on it and what brand is because I
just want to give you guys a fair review
and well then I'm basically going to do
a nail it can tell you what I think of
the palette the end of it because it's
just not that deep
okay super grungy okay so this is
politically as all hurt near those so
nice I didn't do this right for your
business but purely for your benefit
because I'm just going to show you how
is it one thing I will say and the
palette there's not really a suitable
shoot from my safe paint of my eyeball
so I'm just going to use beaches and
cream by makeup geek and we're just
going to put that all over a tons of it
on really matte buy that there you know
so I'm doing my eye makeup first before
my eyebrows I don't have the names of
the palette so I will point to the
colors that I am using but this first
sheet I'm going to use is this one right
here and we're just going to pack that
one in the crease I'm just using my Mac
two to four brush feel free body me
buddy me with this brush because it's
the base brush okay its advocacy for
soft transition isn't it yeah I like it
and the way I did this look was pretty I
want to slap - it's just the way that I
do a grungy eye makeup I just throw all
the eyeshadow on my eyes but what I'm
going to do next this color here same
brush in movement so basically the way
that I did this look was it just went
into the parlour and I picked every
single warm color and the way from light
to dark and built up in my crease that
honestly borders and can I just throw on
on the color around I'm going to go with
this color name and we're just taking
retain cells and these are
and the crease and I'm not sorry to
bring the blend and over a day I'm just
try to get that color nice and deep and
then I use decided brush once the color
is old positive on my teeth as you say
to the branch and start dragging it
outwards and then the cosmos Luca is
quite grungy I'm just bringing out right
down
I think I'd call it a lot it's like
literally the middle color in the
palette I can go and see that all run
out of that for I'm going to go back in
with this one on the side of my brush
and just use that to help blend out so
I'm just kind of slightly winging that
out I just want it to be can a small
cure in the good food I'm going to swap
my brush over to a slightly smaller
brush this is the two to eight from
zoeva
and we will end with that same color see
if we can just pack that one way in the
crease I'm going to put a little corner
a little bit I'm going to go in with my
two to four from zareba and we win with
that middle color again we're just going
to go under their eye you might have
noticed my light concealer with creasing
a little bit under my eye and that
happens every time I do my eye makeup
the caught what I was going to make up
the cause I actually use that
cleanliness and the concealer to the
busted eyeshadow in and then that means
it really would move all day some using
that too - for its own what it looks
like created beginning what we're just
using that to really buff the end I'm
going to take my powder brush we used
earlier just to blend it upwards okay
notice that adding some day I'm going to
take this color right here we're going
to start building up the over corner so
the way I do this is I just get tons of
toys out and I just start stepping it on
blend that into the crease a little bit
right I think that's going on the other
side obviously I'm really happy with the
result but that shadows going on a lot
easier on the site and I think one
should kind of warmed up a little bit
can I go in the pan a little bit there's
a come over
you're pregnant said we were in a car no
I'm just really I'm just not security
Pegman the war and we did one with that
metal sheet again my favorite color and
I'm going to just use that on the very
edge to tackle those sides to get it
blended swimming in a corner I'm going
to go under my eye with that darkest
shades of the new Zen man app slipping
my first is when they enter to read a
lot of neato still thought all right
okay I forgot even see what was doing
there but that is the money main prize
so this color right here this is the one
so basically once you put all your kind
of dark purples on you grab that are you
right up or right in that crease mmm-hmm
okay now I'm ready to go in with the
darker colored again and just start
building up up one more time and then
I'm going to do the warm color again the
moneymaker the based and I'm just going
to run that under my eye and I'm going
to take the highlighting shade and I'm
going to use that I'm a little a little
semester two four seven I'm just going
to touch that blow straight up there oh
then I get the second sheet in and I'm
going to hit that inner corner and I'm
actually not win right another corner I
go under see right there I don't know
why I just for the drama just for fun
this is old looking keychain so I'm
going to use this color here but
hopefully shimmer just on a middle
finger amazing and like these are good
men they're pregnant is look and yeah I
just use them as my finger is because
they clearly apply will with fingers the
lack of them using our Lily lashes in
the style Miami this is my new favorite
mascara called filly charge size pure
it's just really good
I'm just going to chop this in Scott
on it's just like clumpy enough when I
moved from Alaska died and we're quickly
back on this road from using bread and
cheese chocolate
I'm just going to start in the middle
make sure you get that Lane underneath
my brew and I think that I'm opposed
after my eye makeup is because I just
thought indicate about them today all
about my eyeballs and I'm actually doing
them from really flipping finally and
then I'm running into my beret precise
and you just literally come through and
you can get these here this one really
nice and so I just kind that I break
suspect me open that ten times better so
and then once it cannot Bradley gelled
dry mostly I go through them again and
all the little fibers just stick a
little bit better and it just makes them
look so fab okay I need to get this last
one it really join me all that's not the
same I love you Kevin II on board abort
yes there are the are in Norway semi I'd
to open another set of lashes I don't
know what it will what I like to do this
stick this stage in the game is just
have a look at both eyes nice and cool
to make sure that there's somewhat
similar nothing they are that was way
more hassle than it should be
zoom you a yeah grunge a make sure that
everything so say else that's another
big my lights in my skin fuzz because by
the time I've finished my makeup I can
clean it tails it's going to move around
and stuff with like I'm really just as
Moscow right now I liked it I'm not an
accountant is a little dark but here
what I would do in that situation as I
describe my paper on a brush and then
use it quite firmly just to clean that
up
you can go back and with your eyeshadow
brushes and just blend it back out if
you need to then for my lips I'm going
to use an advocate yeah I like doing
that
so I'm going to use my sieve that skinny
debt website by Tarte which is probably
much like my most used ended lipstick
ever I was going to fill that on with no
let me know and I just think I blend
that and I'm going to use a little touch
of my lyre lip liner I'm just going to
line my lips because that's just looking
a bit too Z half here with that but what
I'll do now is I'm going to go on top
with my lipstick again right over the
lip liner and then again anger playing
holla and or she grows you and then just
take your hero zone see it went so much
like a hobo
she really stop doing that to my ear and
that you guys as the finished look yeah
I think it's a lovely I know that I
think it's it's dark at the moment and
I'm lucky enough to get it in PR so
thank you very much more feet I'm Jaclyn
health for saving yeah I think it'll
come back and start for sure and
hopefully for everyone that's watching
this in the UK hopefully it comes when
Beauty viewers and point out because I
know that sometimes a crescent sees and
stuff like that can make it super
expensive I don't know about you guys
when I really love and support someone I
don't really mind pain like customs and
stuff like that obviously it would be
brilliant if Beauty be or color you pick
this up whether it's a restock and I'm
sure that that'll happen and in which
case I would definitely recommend that
way look I'm Jaclyn I go through yeah
very well you have like a couple Matt
Instagram posts and you called your turn
so thanks but I'm amazing well done
congratulations and when you are
choosing her eyes OMF advocate palette
bubbly feel like we know what you want
me to do anymore lips using the direct
inhale morphe palette and other than
that I hope you liked this video and I
