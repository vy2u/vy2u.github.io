to show you how I achieve that still
look I have called it like an everyday
makeup because it adds the meet up that
I go to and when I say that lips to do
it supra notch for me and relatively
easy as well so our hope you guys like
it and obviously I'm gonna show you how
to do this warfare cold and I really
hope you guys like this tutorial and if
you'd like to see how I creates a
slippery - okay let's just start at
Franklin of many years and the daily
reviving concentrate from Kiehl's just
is where my favorite oils so we use this
every morning and I have been using
every morning before I would say at
least like three weeks so I get some
drop maybe a bit four or five I'm just
going to rub that into my skin when I'm
doing my daily makeup my go-to everyday
makeup my favorite thing about it is to
have an really flesh Dewey Dewey Dewey
Dewey skin so this it really helps is
that and also I think I think it's just
help em balance my skin it helps with no
big mess and it's just going to sort my
skin out really I've got a couple of
blemishes that milady and things are
happening this week that you know you
can't you can't avoid it you can't can't
not have these things so yeah ones above
that is my skin and we will end it with
the killed creamy eye treatment with
avocado that is my go-to item I use it
do night Peter tell me on snapchat you
probably will see me talked about much
computing things like that so I'm just
going to get a little can a green or a
sizemode on my ring finger and one of
you guys told me in the comment the last
time I used this that it's much better
to warm up in your fingers first and
then I'm just going to apply that under
my eyes and then the excess just goes
all motorist okay once I've done that
I'm actually not going to use primer or
moisturizer to do it is because I want
to see her friend a shingles on with
just the oil I tried that yesterday in
this beautiful someone to turn again the
trendy company used is the Pirates of
the influence of the sea Foundation and
the she'd lates and when it give this
shape you need to shake this product
because it
quite what to date quite a watery
condition I was tying a later can a
coverage foundation and I tried this and
I really liked it so once than that it's
a dropper bottle so you just push the
top end and then I'm just going to pop
that the back of my hand even though
it's a lighter coverage foundation I do
like to still get a bit too pumped to
this and when apply laps with my Beauty
Blender
so you'll see soon as it's on it does
get a really nice coverage but it's just
thought lately and because I'm kind of
more skin focus these days I am getting
that nice and it's just super easy and a
water all de estudiante before and it
worked beautifully and always I do like
to go a little bit over my let's just
can I hide the pigment of them because
they are so red naturally and you'll see
I've got some kind of scaling on our
foreheads and more rank because I've had
some problems of mask and just blemishes
the use there are slowly but surely
healing up nice and that just covers
them without being social coverage that
looks cakey but it just covers up the
deadness nicely and again record them
using almond oil underneath is too
perfect and we've now minded I cousin
vinaigrette concealer as usual under
there okay
for concealer I'm going to use the
Maybelline a laser eye the shade I use
is late so I'm gonna just use dot to
start putting out on underneath my eyes
just the kind of same shape I usually go
for the cannot slight triangle and I'm
actually bring that great going to a
journalist paint and underneath and then
on my chin it will I'm gonna wood and
right and then I'm just going to
beautiful in back in Israel and that is
add that just a very minor coverage that
I'm looking for oil using a lightweight
friend Asian and in a difficult rate
under my eyes
now I'm moving it with my lingual pin
pot and we can run with the top of our
Beauty Blender and I'm just going to put
that over my leg and I'm sure you guys
know it's already but I actually have
lash extensions this is my first time
getting them done and oh my god I love
them
getting your classic dancing wood saw
you be a hook a little bit more about
some clinicals do my makeup so I'm just
going to go ahead I'm careful to put my
primer on because I only want a little
thing but because my go-to oil it is
these are actually really like Irish
Idol more bit of skin
now that so now I'm going to go in it
with my cover FX custom enhance results
the next is the sheet of subtext so this
is almost the container liquid bronzer
and it's the same ten ideas with Locker
bottles from when you go in and get a
little cuts in the back of my hand and
lift stuff has warmed up the skin it's
cool beautifully I love it so I'm going
to show you guys how I apply that with
my Beauty Blender so just under my
cheekbone and then I'm going to use the
kind of chunkier side of the beauty
blender just to kind of help blend that
into the skin and I'm just using that to
warm up my skin more than anything I'm
not actually proper coordinating with or
anything I'm just warming up my skin and
it just gives a really natural sunkissed
look to your foundation if you are going
on quality or you're don't like really
real makeup during the day a little
touch events just on your cheeks gives a
really nice Sun high school a nice can
contour to the skin without being
Peverley your harsh and even though it's
cream it we were crazy to work with if
you're so used to have payable and so
but what's your Beauty Blender
easy now I'm still going to set my face
to propose I don't want anything to move
in that is going to be a really gonna
cream you look ringing is my favorite
Kat Von D translucent paper and I'm just
going to kind of semi beat underneath my
eyes to go down with Madonna Beauty
Blender
you can use a little bit that Plato just
to save your nose and upper lip if
you're like me and that kind of really
tend to get oily the most next I'm going
to do it and win a point with my
Charlotte Tilbury balanced our Bruins
and ghoul and that is in the sheet as
well is this I know this is the
later when there's two bears in business
is the later one and the brush I'm going
to use is actually the Charlotte elderly
parents felt specially going to go hand
in hand
this brush is so good with Cece music
and when you go and make the sculptures
first I'm just going to lately start to
apply that at the data back from a cheap
one and then little kind of circular
movements and this brush was made so you
can actually use the brush on its side
if you want which is cool and I'm
leaving it pretty natural again and then
if this brush is got and they can a
little text to it so Matt's gonna use
that just to kind of dust down your food
vandals and get written just for the
bruised arts as well now that's done
most of my papers just cannot see it in
Kenai skin but I'm going to take my
little Charlotte Soviet magic complexion
growth and exactly for a foundation
where I'm just going to use that
underneath my to get rid of any excess
powder and just smooth all that Oh fab
this is the quickest makeup ever know
what I wanted super glowy glossy red
skin I'm going to go in with the iconic
London Eliminator same idea drew a
parallel sort on the back of my hand
and I actually after use my product
quite a lot I feel like my favorite way
to apply it is which it was my Beauty
Blender from when you go in it was
looking at um clear into the Beauty
Blender and just apply that right on top
of my cheekbones and then up towards the
temples I can guarantee you a few words
and highlight some at least at least
three people will be like you're making
what are you eating on your cheeks so
being careful just apply that right onto
the cheek will ever want to everywhere
because it is really really highlight a
mmm
and then I'm going to back to the cell
sirens in court and going to go and with
the highlighter shade of this with my
little luck see I shadow brush and we
apply that to my kisses ball put it up
my nose and then just doing the bridges
will and where are my top marks are
going to close it's a touch of my inner
corner now I'm going to go straight into
my eyes I'm actually going to use some
makeup D trials because no eudaimonia is
an esse so this is my little toilet that
I made and I'm just going to go in with
this shade here which is peaches and
cream and then ferati just to darken up
my crease a little bit and that's pretty
much yet today I'm going to go and come
back two to four in the shade beaches
extremum I'm just going to shake my eyes
and I get my brush again well because I
want that framework to diffuse me so I
don't want any lanes now once I've
mattifies that we would be shaded crappy
for makeup feet and the same brush I'm
going to keep my eyes open and just
apply that to my crease and bring that
quite far it up because I want my eyes
to look nice and big and obviously
because I have my life sentence on the
eyelid looks like fetched into taken so
if you are very much on the go Pearson
and it takes half the painting to look
presentable really I can leave the house
with no makeup on and still field play
put together the affiliate must end
black alike or a full rank so they're
clearly free and and I bought something
called classics in between which is
there they're not as fluffy but we've
got Mexico's and I just loved the result
a finger so nice and they get old hit at
them for me it she called interval and
she works on it which is very easy to
work so I'll link her page down below if
you in Glasgow and use fancy getting
some hair extensions because she really
is the best they feel like nothing on my
eyes now I'm going to go in Westby shade
of grassy again
and I'm going to enter a coup we don't
have the 231 items Ouisa and she's
expressly and I'm going to just start to
build up underneath my eyes and let's
just kind of helps a underneath the eyes
will the more can I share the report it
doesn't need to be a dark shade remember
it you smell really smoker we're going
with my tattoos for night and the same
shade frosty justified even more I'm
going to run with a tiny back cocoa bear
which is those really nice warm green
shapes and makeup eat your meal Amanda
as when my sees it and I'm just going to
add that underneath my lash line as well
you guys know I like tied up darker
eyeshadow underneath my eye
they obviously my last extensions are
totally stars on top so I'm just going
to focus on the mascara and the bottom
of my eyes
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to use my speak a weak pencils
from Tarte I've talked about this in my
last module
I love it it's super bright and
under-eye it lasts all day doesn't move
so I just really really enjoy it one
week a gateway called or fake week is
called I gave it now I'm going to use my
mad alas mascara so I'm at the bow and
you guys know that I love it for bottom
lashes it's perfect because the brush is
nice and curved and it's a plastic brush
that's not going to go everywhere and
I'm just going to slowly but surely
build up my bottom lashes to match the
talk
wait my hand in the back of my druggies
I'm going to go into those notes all
those like these fluffy lashes and
there's more do a scan I want to go for
more of a Sami match blows so I'm going
to go through my brows with nice ability
to make sure all the hairs are going to
it please I'm going to bring that
Americans can you put it like a hard
a cosmic eigen goddammit why me
hooters
yeah okay I forgive her that I like this
one better
I'm just going to smudge the deal with
okay I'm excited I'm going to kick this
one off I don't know how to do that but
I'm going to try old gods would be soon
Wednesday I'll just choose here as well
this is so terrible
they're going to take some of my jam
appear at my failure war and I'm going
to take this let them dry off because I
don't like it
I think I just want a more natural than
they are and it's pissing me off now
because every time I wouldn't fill them
in do it too bushy okay
there isn't good be free so I'm going to
go in it with a clear brow gel start and
I'm just going to go through my face so
I feel like the longer you work with
this jail it starts to sit and then you
can really shape you know and then we go
and very carefully with a grain one so
it's annoying because I really love this
great Jo and I think it's amazing but
it's soul may say then give it see this
one all the guide my favorite thing I've
ever seen
maybe I'll ever seen that's a bit much
I'm going to break up of my grade and
then I'm just going to use the beatty
tip of the brush just to move these
hairs of the place so gently okay I can
get over that that's why I let just you
can leave it here okay so now that I've
fought for my brows I'm going to
slightly highlight my browbone with the
highlight shades and the home star
palette next I measure and my left so
I'm going to use this is like super
heavy Charlotte Aubry I just realized
but I really like it depends so just
schools make not phones diplomas this is
the Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude lip
liner and she which is beautiful
so does going up the natural at Lane at
the say toilet naturally and then when I
get to the top I just go straight across
and then I start to overdraw their shape
and it just makes our lips look nice and
fill in the center but not to wait if
you know I mean I think I started
getting this crazy with silver lining
and dude electrode from veneers my
favorite type cell Philippines and I
just loved a perfect I'm going to do is
I'm going to hydrate my lips so I just
cannot rise a dual-camera me and then
I'm going to just apply that Cartier
split peas and silky over at the lip
balm and then I'm just going to Pat that
end I was i defied habit of doing next
when people tell you that your lips or
tools azad and i just cannot talk until
it starts to math i do and that's cutest
to finish this tutorial off one of our
favorite things I've been doing lately
as for Flair curls so when we show you
guys how I have been doing that and
there are tons of tutorials on these
first thing I do is I just apply a
little darker dough over my real
freckles with my Kat Von D liner and the
shade is Wornall maybe dark brown or
medium brown I go over top with my red
pencil and I just kind of told that
they're a little bit appreciate the
toilet into the skin so it's not so
obvious as well okay so let's try this
this might work I'm going to use my pen
from Kat Von D and I'm using my red gel
from Illamasqua
and I'm just going to go and pick that
up with my little pin and grab every
screw okay so door feet I could do is
really dark it first
there's method to the madness all over
that's really made so that makes buying
separately perfect so when you're doing
and just make sure that they're scalpers
make sure the Eagle or if your nose a
little bit make sure that they're all
canal not the same size they're no all
symmetrical as well you can use like and
reference images as well and if you want
if you've seen someone that usually like
come so they kind of go down with this
brow gel and darting it around you don't
have to do tons as well you can just do
like a few like some people like to have
a little accent red color like Maine on
a little cheek or simply like them just
kind of the let's actually cute whatever
you want it's a free world and there you
go on top of those and with my red
pencil and I'm just going to Pat them
back and name once if I'm making a first
layer of a coat I'm just going to use my
Beauty Blender over them which this
really suits them guys and you can
almost really like dobson believe so
they're super thin because if you look
people with real physical not all of
them are the same kind of color
someone will be nice some retire scars
were bigger so that is a kind of first
stage and then I'm just going to do it
the same so safe again I'm going to make
some of the larger I'm unique some of
them a little bit darker and this is a
good way to do it because I actually
haven't used different colors it's like
bro universe I've seen some people use
eyeshadow donut looks really nice and I
thought some legal circles on my face is
real side it's kind of go over the list
really
so you guys that is the finished look
some child's and tribulations there
before Bros so I hope you guys lose
Tweel and that's a probably how I could
happily do my makeup led to comfortable
and confident and yeah I just really
like the fake fake hold I think you're
so cute
not overly too difficult is real
actually it's really easy to do I hope

know down below if there's anything that
you guys like to see from me never give
it a little thumbs up if you enjoyed
that I'll never get your task in that
but please do so please and I will see
