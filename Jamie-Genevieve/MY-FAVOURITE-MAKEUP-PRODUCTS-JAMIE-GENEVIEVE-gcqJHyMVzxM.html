going to show you some of my favorite
products I was looking at YouTube and I
realize I have never actually done a
sit-down chat with you guys about your
product I just loved this some of these
products I do use every day but for that
reason I don't really mention them if
you don't I mean it's like they're not
new to me so they're not new for me to
talk to you guys about blah blah blah
blah blah or looking a same point there
are a lot of products here that you'll
have heard me talk about it a million
times but I thought I would just a very
all set down and tell you guys what I
freakin love more photographers now
synopsis basically I fall over 20
products here so I'm going to try and be
quite quick because I don't want you
guys sitting here for absolutely ages
and it's literally just me talking so
I'm going to get started I'm really
excited
these are all products I use on my feet
pretty much every single day but it's
things that I really love those
if I was to lose one of these things I
would be really upset and I would go and
buy it that day yeah I just love it so
let's get started the first time that
when we talk about it as skincare and
the three products that I really can't
live without are my skin Iceland
pure close to this is basically just
like a really lovely lightweight
moisturizer I use it morning and night
most of the time unless can me something
about retro it's just beautiful it ate
my skin a super light underneath makeup
but paired with like an inmate mask it's
perfect for a night time as well same
thing as the deals deals the killed
daily reviving concentrate oil I use
this every single morning I'll pass it
and smash again and then I will put my
moisturizer on and then optimum a cup
I then get to the star of nearly every
single one of my tutorials I think it's
totally changed the texture of my skin
we must get much more hydrated I just
you can love it okay and then the last
kind care product I've got here is the
Kiehl's epidermal retexturizing my tool
dermabrasion I am a huge fan of exfoli
and it
important to exfoliate your skin to get
all that it's kind of off it stops me
from getting blemishes actually I use it
twice a week something that you say can
be even and they're the most finely
milled scrubby scrubby if fully I've
ever used so I use it usually and
honestly I feel like I've had a free
show my skin my foundation just went on
like a complete dream this morning I
spoke about it in my last video I
touched on it and I forgot to connect to
really explain to you guys but yeah it's
definitely worth trying if you're trying
to find an exfoliator that you really
like it's so beautiful it only can
explore that I have used it doesn't meet
my skin feel like it's been stretched of
all the goodness afterwards but at the
same time it leaves my skin is super
super smooth like baby box smooth my two
favorite concealers are called
tart shape tape here and I've got the
Maybelline instance and age every third
eye these are both and plastic
concealers I do use one or the other
every single day they both give it
really really good coverage people are
super long especially underneath the eye
area I've been tired a lot thicker but
the Maybelline it really doesn't cover
everything that you need to and I just
think it's bad I feel like the both can
allow quite a little time but you
probably run out of the Maybelline one a
little bit quicker just because you do
need to use a bit more product as a
heart-shaped cake but both of these
concealers are my goal to talk shop
foundations at the moment what I'm
loving and the Vitara Danone are you
guys know that I hate this up beg came
on Twitter a beautiful the only thing I
would fear at this one and if you cry at
sad animal videos do not have this on
your face I had a little cry and there
was literally straight Joe Murphy's my
foundation totally came off so it's
definitely not water resistant but if
you are a tough bitch
you were totally fine against the most
beautiful flawless coverage it's still
coverage for sure and kind of like a
semi matte maybe my oils will come
through to makes my skin super gooey
especially if you do use an oil
underneath it which I always do
if you don't cry last all day it's a the
other foundation this is quite a weird
one for me but it's a mac prolongwear
foundation I was where sonic deluxe who
is an influencer from Canada we were
working together at them in London and
she swears by this I don't know why I've
never really picked up as fabulous it
does last all day which I wear every day
know my conditions are quite notorious
for breaking people out by that I mean a
Cosi sport so I use that if I am going
to all day as is really sunny exciting
on what something that's going to last
long meetings I mean things like that as
saw gorgeous a a beautiful friend and
apply it with my Beauty Blender and
honestly it lasts all day and one of a
matte finish so that's when I can use
more cream highlighters and stuff just
to get that Duty's doing this back into
my skin but door sleep on this one next
to things of God I use here on my
channel all the time and it's my macro
answers and dark pan and give me son
give me sons what I've been using lately
a little bit more orange need to be
honest and the dark times what I use for
a long long time
they're both great they're just my go-to
I've used both of them as eyeshadows
before as well der that beautiful work
toward a temple party it doesn't fade on
my skin I've been using the responders
for years especially when I had makeup
on clients I would use bronzers and
nothing else
very much so therefore I've been
chatting about this a lot lately as the
pure tomato
late tan praised mineral makeup this is
probably the best programs that I have
used it is not translucent so if you
prefer a translucent paper getting legal
for either the Kat Von D or the Rimmel
they're my favorite translucent photos
but I have been loving using this lately
I use in my center area it really buffs
my foundation oh and it does add a
little touch of coverage so if you want
in a super full coverage this is
definitely my favorite produce radiation
move on to highlighters I'm going to
make a whole video of a my future
highlight
because there is just so many that I
love but at the moment I'd be really
done in the milk is matrix gold or
highway and assure you it says are super
exciting gold highlight obviously a
little bit more gold even I usually go
for
but as stunning Airport Wednesday this
one I've been using for absolutely ages
at the iconic London Eliminator drops
these things are so shiny and we are so
beautiful on the board day as well
socially without really they are so
pigmented you can mix it with your
foundation you can put on your body you
can use it with a Beauty Blender to take
you to the highlight it's super super
pay you now have she's four can a deeper
skin tones and really appeal skin tones
as well so they are really kind of
catering for all skin tones at the
moment I really really like them
beautiful underneath powder highlight if
he was such as much as going to blames
people which I do
and then obviously retain them hold in
my banker opal my backup willful smashed
when I was in early the last time and
I've not replaced that because I would
like to broaden my horizons and all
highlighter game so Becca is my staple
highlighter as I had it here today I
would probably have it on it is the most
beautiful color the nicest texture the
only thing is it smashes so easily and
if you're clumsy leave me your easel
just put your money in the blender
blender up mins feed it to the chickens
because these match like next I have I
shadowed obviously I'm going to talk
about my melt cosmetics eyeshadows I am
so annoyed that these are so difficult
to get here in the UK the only way to
give you those idols is buying them
directly from the milk cosmetics website
and get them shipped over from America
sanity sound gave me my first stack
which I use today and then they'll
actually got in touch with me and the
same epri for I am super lucky I know
for the fact that a few of my friends
who work in makeup ordered from mill and
they did have to pay tax and customs
when I was getting delivered to the UK
which is total bull eat is the most
annoying thing ever is that were set so
much these are the best
I think I've ever used my entire life
and the tool are stunning if I had to
pick ones that I would probably see rust
stack and my favorite and then it's the
dark matter stack I actually have this
one on my eyes today
it's called radioactive the shadows are
just the most pigmented sayings every
one they make during your makeup so easy
because everything just glaze on there
completely phenomenal well done and
another couple eyeshadows I've been
really loving lately are the carbon
turkey sandwich I chose and really
spiked this in village this is spike
these are also super super pigmented
like clearly raised so not only can you
get deceived but obviously you can get
really beautiful transition shades
you've got really some in shimmery
shades as well they've got a whole range
of tools the website that I'll link same
rule whenever I go and get a link for
you guys I always notice that they've
got money off so they're always like 20%
off for these shadows which is like
amazing which is so good so if you're in
need of new shadow going check it open
two key colors because they are
beautiful obviously than any palettes
and things that are really stunning but
I prefer to have a bigger round turn I
know that sounds really nice but I like
our round pad for my eyeshadows
obviously to put these eyeshadows on my
favorite thing in the world and the lien
law lilo pimple I've got tattooed says
lien law right here that goes on in New
York a lot to think of you for doing
that
but it's a private joke between me and
my studies so lilo and I have a Kramer
occipital Pig is a beautiful peachy tone
which cancels out any kind of balloonist
or purple tones and DLitt which most
people have got like little beans
showing through and things like that
just positive skin on your eyelid is so
thin I practice on with a Beauty Blender
all over my legs and I have never had a
problem with my eye shadow crusade my
eye shadow last all day early and I
think it's because of the lien will be
imports of what I do is I put this on
and then I shake it with my pure cocoa
and it's just a beautiful I'm craving
marriage this is phenomenal
everyone needs that if you are super
filled this will be a little bit pinky
on you are equal for soft ochre or
painterly your with other sheets of the
Mac people the next I'm going to do is
literally fly through some pencils I
love using my favorite of our lip liner
is liar by urban decay as being was
perfect nerds and all the lines just
here I use it every single day if I'm
going to club set what it on right now
what I'll usually do is line my lips and
then Pat my nude lipstick all in with my
finger and that displays a lip liner and
it's just perfect for the last too long
on the lips it's just like my favorite
lip liner ever
I must are going through a rage hanabi's
New York favorite eyeliners I love
asking opponent rendered smokey eye but
when I do Delano when I do Jelena
I use either the Kat Von D trip which is
stunning and obviously it's a best
eyeliner in the market that is still
kind of affordable in my opinion I've
not tried any of the super high-end
liquid liner notes because I'm so just
hair I would leave the lid off and never
dry out instantly thought Capaldi to
folks I'm really great dupe for the Kat
Von D trooper as the new next epic ink
liner is the same brush tip what I will
see is sometimes you need to connect
frozen up but it's super black and a
little bit more shaming than super liner
but it's so affordable that it's just as
well into the mid be okay super quickly
favorite nude waterline laner and sleek
a week by car at last all day it's
really really opaque and get your lean
Mason Brea put on today I always reach
for that when I am doing a really bad
food item P I just refined a little bit
bigger actually loved it and favorite
protein cells as the next micro brow
pencil and it's just one of the
retractable ones it's got a silly on the
end honestly every single brave painful
to me is this week and two series of
errors if the series of area by urban
decay do I still look those other
products totally I love them but the
fact that essence or for 12 weeks
winner in my book favorite mascara as we
push up angel mascara by Maybelline
another super affordable product if you
remember I made a venule
and individual I made fun of this
mascara because it's got really shifted
brush that's why thought is actually
brilliant you can get your eyelashes
super long and SEC it does little clumpy
there it's really really easy to use
it's super black it doesn't crumble on
your face or the D it's amazing for
getting your bottom lashes makes them
second long which is what I struggle
with
yeah and I know that they know how to
eat waterproof formula of this if that's
what you need to solve fabulous mascara
favorite nude lips x of all time skinny
dip bite are salty both heart this is a
liquid lipstick which strains own that
and this is extremely lipstick which
obviously is creamy crack swatch that is
skinny get the lipstick I honestly wear
this every single day and then salty
bite art which is a liquid lipstick when
you just on the top here what I do is
I'll pop them on an impact and move with
my finger and that just gives the most
beautiful blend I don't really get the
new dealing with these either
I just always keep atop some I've always
got these in my handbag I love them so
much I love them there I'm going to
quickly touch on tools so tools that I
really love are this is so gross because
the glue the glue burst okay but this is
my favorite eye lash glue it is the duo
blue and the green racing and basically
it only takes three brush-on glue and
use every single day there's a lot of
juice for this is real but I always find
them to be more expensive that I think
continents ex-cons last absol age is
obviously exploded when I was on a
flight so it's a bit naughty and I love
it my lashes
never left you never come all another
thing I use every single day to put my
lashes on and the Tarte large applicator
it's just made my life so much easier
because again I read quite thick lashes
with no liner to my lashes one with this
and then I gave them a good squeeze into
my lash line and that makes the whole
thing seamless and they last all day and
make sure that the lash is super close
to the lash line as well
couldn't live without this and then my
favorite tweezers of all time
I bought these over a year ago and it's
the anastasia beverly hills tweezer
they've got sponsored pets they are
super sharp and it would've only said
two tweezers that I've had that haven't
got one
we still grab all the years when I'm
cutting my shows it's just the basically
squeezers I've ever had quickly when I'm
talking about lashes and things like
that my favorite favorite lashes right
now more so than the McConnell's lashes
by Lily lashes are the ones I have on I
don't actually have a spirit here which
is release pick me out and he's gone by
some but these are the Lily lashes and
the style can they are I've had these on
about 20 times though they're really
really start dudes they're really fluffy
they are really nice and long and you
can a peek on the outside so there's
your eye that kind of left it okay
they're different favorite lashes and
I've wore them everything believe four
or two weeks which is disgusting and
fabulous at the same time I'm going to
really quickly talk about my favorite
brushes and a beautiful info I'm mostly
quickly see this is my favorite thing to
put on my foundation Beauty Blender most
people have it everything it's just
alright hope it's not it's medical I use
this for putting my eye primer on I use
the top I use the bottom typical
foundation on and I use it to set my see
sometimes with powder I use it to apply
cream highlighter it's a fantastic tool
and then I'm going to really quickly go
through my favorite brushes at the
moment
smack one one two perfect for powder I
use a powder underneath my eyes
can I change Allah weight underneath my
bronzer with my Pogo just to make sure
that everything is nice and seamless
Charlotte Tilbury powder and sculpt
brush amazing for exactly that coding
and sculpting I only use them like my
contour and bronze in product it just
makes it really really easy to get right
and at the corner and I actually use
this brush to go right at the sides of
my nose and in underneath as well from
my nose contour and I really beautiful
breasts because it's slightly tapered
and I don't know how it just works like
the base brush
ever has for quartering favorite a
brushes of all-time some of these you'll
definitely know but I absolutely love my
mark 34 is the perfect brush for fluffy
blends and I use this to set my
eyeshadow base I also use it to build up
the crease color usually I can just fill
I makeup with this one brush if I need
something that's a little bit smaller I
will use these leave a two to four which
is super small it's super scent but it's
so what that really makes bend to it so
it's fabulous for fills up the crease
and smoking it underneath your eye so I
absolutely love this and then another
small brush is be more see in final
seven and really beautiful for help and
with Cochran says it's small enough to
get right and it leaves it small enough
to do your inner corner and underneath
your eyes will usually use these view
brushes to create an entire eye look

my favorite eye brushes we're done as
