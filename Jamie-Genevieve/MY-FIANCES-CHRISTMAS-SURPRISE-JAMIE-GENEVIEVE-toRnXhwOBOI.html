one-off top secret Sunday's I have got
an idea for dice Christmas he is going
to seem excited so basically it's top
secret I have help on dick me and
Charlotte are just wait to drive to
Calais ice and we're starting phase one
of Kinder Surprise geek neutral here
what
thanks to upload Kinder Surprise I've
got to get making machines
this is musical music Airport and I'm
going to put Jack's name Eddie Rome GA
Li yah yah ha ha we're making Jack's
Christmas present aren't we to be Ribisi
Merry Christmas jack look how cool this
is I just made this ticket and we're
gonna print it a cut eight and we're
going to roll up and put it in something
fun you guys woulda seen that Burma can
give Vic plane ticket and that's because
for Jack's Christmas I have bought a
place to New York and we are going to be
going to New York and it doesn't know
this either but I need to be in Toronto
for work so we are flying to New York
for a holiday together and then we're
going to Toronto for work and then we're
gonna fly home and it's got no idea at
all the only thing he talks about
as New York the only thing he shows me
videos of New York and he constantly on
Facebook and stuff leave an entity it
was showing me what tame squirrel it's
late right now and with that it's
snowing in Manhattan right now and I'm
just over ended a bit this about a month
ago
do you know how hard it is to keep my
mouth shut I keep I keep on going to see
stuff about it so we're going to print
off a note and then we're gonna do some
DIY yes I don't let this huge one out
but we're actually going to use the
small so it's actually like lace guys
you know
I'm here for Charlotte and kind of
casket as a nice maybe stuck so we have
to take that right here it's old trying
to like what we're gonna do is we're
gonna really carefully we kind of
started to feel less candidate we're
gonna gently happen we're going to take
the toy cat toy and put in the best toy
that's a toy maybe everybody can have
its way and then we're gonna fold this
pick her up and put it here
can you still do it yes I've kind of
like pure during the whole age because
it's like folded twice so we just have
to put it back together and so gently
look it looks so good I know it's can't
you just see that smell I'd smell okay
so if you're an American you can't do
this because candid eggs are illegal the
toy a right and then just to
double-check yeah Jack's toy see ya and
the chocolate we need to remit us
together let you see it's melted yeah it
smells great stuck on on is that it's Oh
bill it's anyone back in the pledge now
put a backing of throats put it back in
the fridge massive Charlotte Crito
written in the flesh we're doing it in
the fridge because it's just too hot
just put it back on feel actual just
gonna pinch-hit lined the hallway so
basically the hot knife melts the
chocolate back together so it looks like
it's untouched the only sad thing is it
the chocolate savvy bit melted but
chocolate is hopefully eat it anyway and
if it doesn't then I'm just gonna have
to ruin the surprise and see just good
it
the pen for the team is the flirty tempo
used to get one big sheet a ten foot you
should wrap it back up notes to safety
pets there totally their ratified check
to spend at once and never to be fed
back here so I think the kingdom is just
in there something I'm going to do
Jack Jack is the home and do it my
makeup this book or do not bother me let
me alone
Jack I'm gonna wrap the rest of my
present so don't come in my room okay
I did it it takes them the girls to see
how I should make jack open it and
Charlotte says did you see open it so I
could have the chocolate so yeah check
that was the making of your present and
I love you and I hope you're excited
love you bye
and you got your placement widget baby I
got that's correct hopefully it's good
I'm facing pansy do me a favor
there can be big special edition I want
you to open it now yeah I don't care if
you don't admit for chocolate know what
you have to know I think if the toy
insider threat to be cool is that we're
going to New York yeah and then you're
flying with me to Toronto for work I'm
what was your approach your favor the
tail we've ever see that one we're
staying at the one hotel in Santa park
and then we fighted Tyrone all for free
days together
mom dad had already arranged to come
here and stay at the house okay well I
actually have something to show you
hey got a bit of a video to watch wasn't
it yes it's a one-off tops of it
I got him
I got you I thought I thought it was
gonna figure a new idea I'm so excited
so we leave technically two weeks two
and a half weeks and two and a half
weeks relief end and we're going back to
New York yeah and now it's Christmas but
I thought that I would film it a little
bit and try and get his reaction but
