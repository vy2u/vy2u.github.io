I woke up it's Saturday and I was like
I'm just going to do my go to makeup so
this is what I do when I just want to
look nice then I know that's kind of
like suits me it's back to my Kenner
grungier sales of makeup and yeah I'm
using a few new products that I'm not
sure you guys yet so I hope you like it
and if you'd like to see how I created
this look bitchin let's do this okay so
recently I still love my Bobbi Brown for
your space obviously but I've been using
the skin pure cloud cream and I've been
really liking it so what I'm going to
start with and off with that it smells
amazing I feel like my skin's been a lot
kind of kamar when I've been using it it
does see like the brand slogan if you
will is solutions for stress again yeah
I just mean really like in it hydrates
are just enough it's nice under makeup
as well because it's cloud cream it's
really late next thing I'm going to
going with is my tarte maracuja I keep
my eye
gone through one of these already I
usually like it I think it is late
enough it doesn't going to leave my eye
makeup super hydrating which is always
important a trained eye area and it's
not too sick I don't like anything with
too much residue and right my eyeballs
fresh as a daisy so I've been reading
I've gone a few days with no makeup just
reading those boos kind of products in
skin care products and it's been pretty
fab next time we learn with as my frame
rate this is the way I sell top secrets
instant moisture glow I've only used
this like maybe five times now but every
time I use it my foundation lasts ages
and even sounds really nice cloth but so
I like it I'm making a whole lot out of
any kind of why I sell product as well
as quick looks to do it feels nice on
the skin it's not one of those primers
that in is slippery like with silica
like me personally I'm not a huge fan of
well unlike a murgatroyd but I prefer I
can a jail primer now we're going to go
in with foundation this is my Born This
Way Foundation
she I am as a leaked beach and I've been
using this since I went away with
toothpaste so that's essentially bad I
did use it beforehand but I use it with
a brush which was fine it was a nice
foundation but it applies so much better
art with a beauty blender so I'll just
start and the middle of my face and then
work my way out and yeah I've been using
this everyday
I really really could I like oh you can
stop can I see you like skim through it
if you know I mean just beauty blend in
that Elmen but how nice is that really
it's beautiful and it does it covers up
any kind of little scars I've got from
blemishes and discoloration and my skin
and I think it just brightens up a lot
now you can see that I'm going to use as
the instant anti age eraser I Maybelline
so it's a really popular Maybelline
concealer I went into boots to grab this
a preschool go I've used a couple times
and it's pretty amazing and I like how
easy it as well just a little wet
and then I'm just going to highlight my
whole face to this color I got the color
late but I am yeah whatever I've used
this it really doesn't move and then I'm
just going to blend that back at my boot
lender and I think with a pigment it
just blends really nice it doesn't
disappear or anything which I've had
with drugstore concealers I find it you
put them all in you look lovely and
their listen as you start blending it
disappears but you don't get that with
this at all I think it's Ferb I'm really
went with a lean little paint pot by Mac
this is Michael to viewports the
ordinance I use an arrow do if you are a
fear a bit paler than myself you might
find it's a little bit orange in which
case I would go for a painterly or
social clothes are both good sheets as
well and I'm just going to use my Urban
Decay don't don't don't concealer brush
just to apply that all over my lid see a
break as I look snow compared to this
one it just gets rid of any kind of
darkness and the light any discoloration
and then we put that under the eyes or
so for me that's like a really perfect
base like I've been really like and
doing this next thing we do get my
favorite cat on DEET translucent locket
track but comes Austin Satan powder and
I'm going to take my dark Beauty Blender
and I'm just going to set my concealer
under my eyes and if I get the can out
fat bit of the Beauty Blender and I just
Pat that on in between my eyebrows
because that's when I get shiny and then
just my smile lines the curse of being a
happy person a lot but my chin is it
also just literally my standard indios
and under my eyes because that is where
I crease or or shiny privity the eyelid
I'm going to do am as from when I was a
wee and I leave with two feet a lot of
people too crazy to see that look on my
Instagram so I'm going to use the
chocolate bar palette from Too Faced and
to create it I'm going to use my Mac two
to four brush and this color here to set
my lit as palette smells ridiculous
I thought you'd join me then so you can
see so I'm going to go in with the shade
white chocolate and just save my entire
lid and then I'm going to go in with the
shade hazelnut which is just here it's
like they can a latest transitioning
shade if you will and we're going to
need to see them two to four brush and
we're going to start building that up in
the crease
and I bring my smokes quite high up in
the inner corner here and then make sure
that it's nice and nice cannot
underneath the drive here so you're
getting that nice highlight just kind of
tell it my brush upwards and using the
edge of the brush to define the crease
and then the rest of the brush is just
kind of diffusing that up towards the
pro- I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my next seventeen brush and the
color
milk chocolate which is just here and
we're going to find that crease a little
bit more
and then I'm going to go back in with my
two to four brush and the transition
shade and just blend that it a little
bit now I'm going to start
darking that up again with cherry
cordial which is a super super dark
purple in the palette basically is the
darkest purple and we were with my NYX
seventeen brush again and just start
defining them once you've got that kind
of built up on the top what we're going
to do is I'm going to wake away those
chances and pay don't leave my eyes and
all its laces I sit on dry and we're
going to start bringing this these dark
colors underneath daylight so I'm going
to go in with my smooth two three all
brush and the color milk chocolate which
is the second darkest color ears
we blend that out with my two to four
and I'm going to try and get this a
these ends came out a lot bit more
rounded because I love it when it was
like this at seeds so that's what we're
going to try and do so just create an
that sheet with the two to four brush
and a little bit that milk chocolate
color just don't be scared to bring it
far down your eye I'm going to into the
cherry cordial color which is that
purple again with my leave r22 for the
one the only just to get that nice
rounded shape again
and then again blending that with my
tutor for tonight you're going to take
that two to four and the cherry cordial
color once more and just try and buff
that into the crease a little bit to say
it the lid I'm going to use this color
again we're going to keep it all matte
and that just really brightens it up and
the brush I'm using is the morphe m42 to
brush projects look I don't use leaner
I just put lashes and mascara on so
we're going to do that I'm going to use
my Mad Max mascara I've used this in the
last couple videos because I do like it
I think it's a great mascara for lashes
we're going to use the Lily lashes and
opulence I'm going to fit around through
these make sure that they're dry and I'm
going to do my brows off camera because
my last video was a Brady toriel on
happy do my brows at least I'll link
that down below and I'll catch back here
to finish the skin it's up to you if you
want to add a little bit inner corner
sparkle I'm going to just add a little
bit of the champagne truffle color on my
inner corner what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go in with my NARS Laguna
bronzer I got that from duty free on my
way home from alien last time because
everyone that says it's the base of her
and I want to try it and I actually
really like it so it's the m42 brush
from morphe the big huge one that
everyone uses and I'm going to start
creating some some color you know with
us bronzer I just gone with a little bit
at a time pretty dark and when we were
under mattoon one thing I noticed when I
use this bronzer is the place where I
stopped powdering my my eyes kind of
thing can go a little bit patchy but the
blush I use can only match that up
the next product for cheeks is my Laura
Geller blush and brighten and
hello son sweet I love this so much oh
just get the same brush up on the top
and it just adds I really lovely blush
the skin is a perfect for earth um I
feel but I've been using this every
single day now I'm going to wear with my
camera corn at medium sculpting codes
are at with my Smith
one one two brush and I'm just going to
channel the very back to my cheekbones
and then well I've got this brush in my
hand and we'll go back in with my Laguna
and just quickly bronze the sides of my
nose this is just like a really quick
easy moves concert and I just kind of
touch underneath as well and it just
means that your nose because obviously
I've done all the sculpting to the
outsides your face you need a little
something here just to give it dimension
highlight time I'm going to use my
Anasazi glow cat in sun depth with my
Viva rose golden 29 fan brush and when I
go in with a mix of this color here
satin summer and moonstone
and
and then I just use my hands to apply a
lot of a highlighter on the end of my
nose
and then I just Pat that in with my
speech blender and then same thing emoji
football last but not least we're going
to delet so I'm going to use the next
turnt-up lipstick and the shade flawless
suits me fine and then I'm going to use
LMR Scott lipliner and dream this is the
slick stick yeah slick slick and dream
