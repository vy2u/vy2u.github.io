we are going to do this whole look here
and it's perfect for running errands
school work forever it's just a wee bit
more than the natural state for me and
I'm using kind of furniture products not
going as heavy into the skin like I
usually do I was on periscope spawning
and I asked you guys if you would like
to see the makeup I do that's kind of
easily fixed since not it's not going to
come off like I am over the fact that
this makeup comes off really nicely but
also can is patched up really easily
you're not going to get products living
on top of each other too much and things
like that so if you'd like to see how I
created this look stay tuned
hi there let's get started so I'm gonna
go in with my Bobbi Brown face face as
always I think I've talked talked about
this and most makeup tutorials I just
really love it I think it goes my skin a
really beautiful pull-on flick I think
it smells incredible it's great for
hydration but it doesn't leave a really
sticky residue it means with makeup in
mind so it's not like there's a lot of
skincare products I think that in aren't
the base underneath foundation and stuff
but this was me just for that rule I
love it
I think as well I really notice the
difference when I don't use this and my
skin and my skin is going to better
lately I just picked a spot yeah I just
think it's great I just I just I just
think it's late and everyone I can
honestly see everyone that has weight
enjoyed it because of me has it like
messaged me and said wow Jamie you're
right that stuff is amazing and I'm like
I don't I'm on periscope this morning
and we decided that I'm going to use the
Giorgio Armani stuff I'm gonna give it
another go I haven't used I have used it
I usually mix it with stuff I just leave
it too dark for me but that's fine so I
just put some pumps in the palm of my
hand
and I'm gonna apply straight with my
Beauty Blender and the reason we're
using this is because I feel it's a lot
later then in then what I usually wear I
think it goes a really nice flawless but
late coverage it doesn't look like it's
not like one of those Fendi shoes that
looks nice on
I'm running super cakey and really
honestly that I've seen a few people
wear this foundation or I've asked Wow
what if you go on your skin looks
amazing and they said this and I was
like what
so I'm gonna give a good try today see I
think balance gorgeous in the viewfinder
it's too dark for me I'm so weird next
thing we're going to do she achieved
concealer I use this every day I can't
not use it okay I love it so I'm going
to just use that underneath my eyes I'm
not using either much as usual I need to
put some on my nose man my little sports
or doing my hair down drop are you just
setting your friend buddy so I just
putting that on like that and then I'm
going to use my Beauty Blender it just
to bullying that back hurt again
I know who could be lovely there's to be
but added coverage and sin era I'm gonna
get my face a little spray of my
cordially stuff which I'm lovin you're
talking to me I'm just gonna be my
finger I just to blend it right
underneath my so I think this is gonna
be a really nice tutorial for like work
I can imagine doing this if you see if
you loved in your makeup but you don't
have like too much crazy major time and
more annoyed but is like perfect hey I'm
just gonna go in with my lean little pin
port from Mac and I'm just using my
finger to apply that all over now I'm
not necessarily doing this just so I've
got like a super crazy beast for a
bull's eye shadow but it also like it
counts as like a like a brightens up the
eyes will see because it's all peachy it
just evens out the skin tone and it just
creates I to be mouth effects that's
pretty much all we're doing today we're
just going to get this nice blank canvas
and then we're just gonna put a nice
neutral shadow in there just to make
sure it makes a month so I'm bringing
that right up to the brow and I'm gonna
go in with my little zoeva this is the
concealer buffer brush no spring the
tiniest little bit of that just under my
lashes I feel like that stuff's really
really like sketchy and parented so that
last ages underneath the eye I use this
stuff every day I know but it's the tart
is Sheila palette and I'm just going to
the sheet here it with my mark 2 to 4
just to mattify my whole lid
and that just saves the primo enemies
you don't have to worry about creasing
all day now when you're going with the
highlight shade and the same brush and
I'm just going to highlight my blade
board and I like to do this before I
actually do my bracelet cause when I do
my blows I'm just going to brush through
them today with like a braid shell and
if I was to do the highlight afterwards
there's a chance that the highly could
get all caught up in the hairs and stuff
I'd have to redo them anyway nice and
well I've got this palette I'm actually
going to just highlight several minors
and highlight a little bit there
and then we touching the Cupid's bow as
well guys I think I'm actually gonna do
my finish my eyes off now so I'm just
going to go it with tiny little bit of
this shade here which is the contour
color that I usually use and and I'm
gonna just pop that in my crease it's
literally just the tiniest little bit
it's almost like icon tuning rather than
eyeshadow it's just put a little touch
of that contour just above the crease
I'm going to do the same thing on the
inner corner so it gives that nice
sculpted look without actually ruin too
much eye shadow and then I'm just
dragging that down the sides of my nose
I'm swapping my brush over it to the
Smith 2 4 7 which is just the guy at
smaller eye shadow brush and I'm just
going to drag a little touch of that and
I say to my eye and when you keep it
today say at me sighs look bigger I feel
on me so instead I can I put it right
underneath I'm just keeping it to those
sides the lashes I'm gonna use today are
the ill daughter lashes and each one
sexy the are are really all favorite
main severe they are just really really
recipe or blending on and so I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take a matte Park give
them a slight trim just to make sure
they're gonna fit in properly and then
I'm gonna glue their mark I'm gonna pop
on my favorite mascara and this is just
the volume million lashes from L'Oreal
my mascara is drying and the lash glue
is drying so while I'm waiting for that
I'm just going to check on my HD a bit
Buddhist bronzer it's just a really
really nice easy blame
then bronzer and I just want that can at
Suncoast look to do nothing too crazy
I'm hoping a quandary then and then I
like to just use to be brush just to get
say to my nose
mmm bronze and fab so I'm gonna put my
lashes or no good I find my lashes and
tweezers now I'm just kind of wiggling
the lash band into my lash line with the
tweezers and then I'm going to let them
dry a little bit more and then I'm going
to squeeze them together it with my
fingertips so when we're waiting for
that to happen I'm gonna get my grows
yeah the guys decide to trip rellenos
just in case I'm going to use my
previously Rimmel brilliant plumper it's
is failing gel and I'm going to use my
benefit precisely my brilliance of so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
first go through mr. dry jail I'm a
really super fluffy so the color of that
I think it's just brown medium brown
0:02 meeting dry and then the color of a
pencil I'm going to use as a number four
and I'm just going to use this to pretty
much get the front of my brow down here
a little bit thicker
I'm always using the pencil on its side
so it's not as kind of precise and I'm
just smudging it into the front of my
brow and then just use my finger just to
diffuse that between the heroes and then
you can do the same thing get to the
topic you like I might just sleep put a
couple of little strokes through the
arch because I do like leaving them kind
of fluffy looking these days so these
pros may not be for you
I don't like sculpting right sometimes
as well still but I just thought that
this is so pretty
for just like a nutshell a chill D you
know the bodies of little girls I'm
going to line my lips with space from
Mike and then we're going to blend that
in with your finger and then we're going
to pop a gloss on top
and then I'm just going to use my finger
just to blame that in a little bit that
just makes it kind of nice like touch
color and then I'm going to put on the
Kylie left Italy cloth literally so nice
that's really nice I thought that
setting in my drawer for ages and I'm
not I actually reached for that yeah oh
I really like that huh and and then just
finish off I'm going to put on my Marc
Jacobs lipstick so that's just me
personally I don't like to use it kind
of too much pager highlight when I'm
trying to be fresh and natural and just
like Heil Siegel you know so I just like
using my dad Beauty Blender grabbing
that product and tough no on
and I like to use just a little touch
just up here mmm and then honestly I
just drive my bronzer brush and just
cannot bring the bronzer like that can
has smooths out the highlight make sure
it's nice and smooth and I would call it
a day from here I hope you guys like
that's a total and let's make up it
doesn't take too long at all I find it's
really nice to be something that I feel
comfortable with I know that I feel
quite pretty when I don't have too much
eye makeup on just nice kind of fade
early lashes and a nude lip obviously I
just kind of feel like my best self so
it's also really easily fixed so you're
not reading too much makeup that if it
comes off it's going to look like
horrendous or perfect for me today and
all I'm going to take with me to touch
up is my friends elation and review
blender it just to touch up here we have
to take off I will take my lip gloss
from Kylie and my my lip liner to fix my
lips and then just my highlighter just a
touch up just here cuz I know exactly
where I'm going to be getting that poop
and to be honest I may bring my blinds
oh just sticking a sort out but you can
just shove all that and we makeup bag
not too bad
