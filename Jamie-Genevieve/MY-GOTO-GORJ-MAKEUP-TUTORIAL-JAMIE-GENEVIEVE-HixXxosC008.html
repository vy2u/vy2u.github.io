I just wanted to do you makeup tutorial
something that I wear all the time this
is definitely one of my go-to looks it's
your super soft bronze glow skin just
like one of my favorites ever and I am
using if you need product a few old
favorites and yeah I really hope you
like it
if you would like to see how I create
this look then please stay tuned
oh I savor this so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna start off with my skincare
I've got some really lovely comments on
my skin and my fancy video so I thought
that I would just touch on that really
quickly and I've been using the same to
these things every single morning for
about a month now and as the Cape rest
antioxidant jus first so why do that as
I just put probably a drop on the for
can I point to my face and then I just
give up a Robin and is the most gentle
hydrating layer and my skin care routine
and I said before but I just think it
really comes from my skin and hydrates
my skin as well so I never have any kind
of dry patches added over and then once
you rub the end you can feel like
getting a little bit tacky so I think
that maybe helps my foundation last ages
as well but I just love that second
thing is my tie press Helio tropic
primer and sunscreen so I really like
this you don't need much over I usually
put that much on and then just spread it
around it's just good to your sunscreen
no matter where you live and I really
did not used to kid about that but the
older I get but why is that I get the
more I can I realize that
sunscreen is super important so I'm just
gonna rub that and and once at saurabh
gun there's no quite cast or anything
you can see a little bit at first but it
just sinks and it's not too liquid if
you know what I mean it still makes my
skin feel nice and tacky and it does see
that it's a preemie
so just another layer of skin care
that's going to help her foundation last
forever
why we'd usually do next is use the
keels at Delia driving concentrate but
I'm not going to do that today
they thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to
get the fancy beauty primer there's only
one primer and the collection I'm just
gonna take one pump of that and I'm just
going to use that in my center areas and
this is a mattifying primer and if
you've watched my fancy video you'll
know that I don't usually do that skin
but my god when I use this foundation
with a primer I couldn't believe it
it lasted all day it was matte but it's
not dry doesn't look dried and look
cakey or anything I'm just gonna use
that my Santa video is just to really
keep it on I'm kind of just using that
in my Santa radios like the places that
I get oily and one pump of that is more
than enough and I'm just getting that
good rub into the skin but honestly my
foundation were so nice like that day I
gotta check in on Twitter 10 hours after
I filmed that video and the foundation
still looked to me and said like I'm so
sold on it now I'm going to grab the
fancy Beauty foundation you have to give
this a good shake
I am the shade twinning tea and I'm
really excited to try the oil assess and
also someone commented or tweet an
account remember saying that the
foundation works really well with and
brush so I use a sponge of first I'm
gonna use a brush today apparently it
gives you more fill coverage which I'm
interested in and the brushes I'm going
to use today are mostly gonna be iconic
London I got this and freshly it's
through the post and the brushes
I'll show you them our court first thing
I love the bag that the comment its
budget so it's not gonna get one
squished which means my brushes won't
get squished and these are all the
brushes you get so you get enough for
your entire face but they're gorgeous
they feel really really nice and soft
and yep I'm gonna use one of these
brushes from a foundation and I think
it's gonna be this one
they don't have brush things written on
them but this is the brita I'm going to
use it's kinda like a flat head
foundation brush and I'm just going to
put three pumps of this on the back of
my hand and when it go endless the brush
and I'm just going to step on that on
first and remember this foundation does
oxidize slightly but once it's finished
or today is a and
it doesn't get dark curves throughout
the day like so when but it does dry day
and that is the color your last with so
for a reference I don't really know what
color and other foundations anymore
because I mix them all the time but I am
turn sand and car if that makes any that
gives you any heel okay so once I've
done that I'm just gonna step hold it on
and I don't know how this is gonna work
so I'm not try to get but what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna drop some oil on my face
I'm gonna do four drops one of my cheek
my chin as well and then I'm just gonna
buff that said well that's tickly well
that brush is nice the brush is super
soft it's not leaving any lanes bringing
that down onto my neck a little bit
Wow okay so it's a lot quicker to apply
it when you're using a brush oh yeah I'm
so happy so I have tried this oil trick
with a few foundations and it did not go
well like the more it seems to be like
the more field coverage and matte
foundation the more likely it is to
react badly but that looks really nice
perfect rate okay let's do it I'm gonna
use the matchstick by safety beauty
again in the shade bamboo because I
remember when I was filmed I if I said
that if I could not by one thing it
would have been nice but at war really
really nicely so I'm going to computers
now so I'm gonna try it again cool and
that's just gonna blend that in with his
same brush I think I would actually
really like that and I think using
sticks is so easy I like this brush a
lot that's making it so quick and it's
blended everything really nicely too I'm
gonna use a little bit of shape tape
just on my lid because I do think that
that it's a really it got a really good
eye shadow primer because it's a it's so
mat so I'm gonna just use the same brush
again and I'm going to use a lot better
shape
just next to my nose all those colors
but off isn't it that's the shape time
son
but this foundation is a little bit more
yellow like a puzzle to see yeah well
it's more be aged movie I'm just gonna
push that into machinery videos anyway
they might brighten up a bit I always
like to have a more foundation here like
right in the center of my face this is
just turning into another fancy beauty
tutorial but I absolutely love the stuff
so I can't help it
I'm gonna powder my face using the fancy
beauty and visit matte powder I'm gonna
go under my eyes first I'm gonna go on
my eyelids well you know what's amazing
you get product on your brush but it
doesn't kick up any dust really good so
I'm just patron my eyelids as well
before I shadow mm-hmm smile lines just
gonna actually Pat that on and I'm just
gonna do my forehead as well
yep I like that a lot I'm gonna go ahead
and just keep on working on my skin
because I feel like I like to my skin
first these days so when it went with my
get me Sun matte bronzer just gonna warm
this up a little bit I'm great tempted
to go back to sandy and get a shade
darker and the foundation well it does
actually match me from a blue you know
the powders gonna soar nicely man I just
love this foundation honestly saw neighs
recently I've been using my Kat Von D
palette a ton so I'm going to go in with
my big brush and just this metal shade
and I just like to build up the contour
just a wee bit more so good so good
I don't even wanted to push her today
just bring that bronzer onto the cheeks
a little bit I can see that the
Foundation's starting to dry down nice
and matte which is perfect actually yeah
okay I like a matte finish Who am I Who
am I don't know do not know I'm gonna go
back to my old fears today and I'm going
to use the iconic Eliminator drops and
the original coloring cause the skin is
matte and I do one a liquid highlighter
scanty like super way so I'm just gonna
take a little touch of that on the back
of my hand not much as I'm a lesson I'm
gonna take a blends are beautiful and
dirt and wooded paths like tap that onto
my cheeks and I'm being really careful
don't want it too close to the center of
my face
yeah that's healthy and because I'm on
my browser I'm just gonna go along the
kind of arch of my brow that's the
highlight and the cause my skin's Matt I
feel I can get real assess a lot more
it's really attractive really really
lovely oh my god
gonna keep this pool and then there's
men doors I just think that's a super
healthy looking skin and when you're
careful with that stuff it looks so
lovely like so nice and natural like
natural gloss on this skin that is like
my fear skin right now oh if anyone's
wondering where these hips are from
they're from white folks I'll link them
down below I am obsessed
they're so cute about huge delivery from
white folks and it's literally like my
favorite cause of oh I'm saw buzzing for
them you'll see the moment Instagram I'm
gonna go off camera and just do my brows
I'm just gonna use a brow pencil and
just do them off-camera and they'll be
back to do it we brow the only photo to
use there where the barometer by urban
decay and be shoed dark and then this is
got the label coming off of it but it's
Maybelline very precise fiber feller and
deep brown really like this need to buy
a new one running out for eyes I'm gonna
use the makeup geek in the nude palette
I've been using this quite a lot and I
just think that the tones are fab I
think that it's really really easy to
use the colors are gorge is like perfect
for neutrals and I just love
neutrals okay I'm going to go and with
this shade here watch I was in un
selling me so we're gonna go in with
this shade here and one of the iconic
brushes these are so chic
by the way gold and they come to a point
so I'm just going to use that all over
there we go nice and matte
with this you'd hear it's probably might
with my fav colors in the palette
because it's just a really gorgeous
transition shades and I'm just gonna
start building that up just the same
movements as always and the crease went
away part and then you bring your brush
nice and high up and start to get that
blend up towards the brow and I'm gonna
bring that color into the inner corner
and just almost smudge it into the front
of the brow and you can see that just
makes the eye look a little bit more
moody it's just it's just a feeling okay
I'd like it look at that Shana my skin
I'm so obsessed and again in her corner
right up to the front of the brain and
it just brings down their legs a little
bit it's weird I just love it I love the
way it makes my eyes look I think one of
my favorite things that makeup geek
eyeshadows if you've been around in my
channel for a long time you know more
that I swear by these I don't know why
I've not been using them lately I think
it's just because there's been so many
like eyeshadow palettes coming out but
yeah they're just so easy to use the
blends really will be built up really
nicely all that good stuff I'm gonna go
under my eye with that same shades and
the same brush actually cuz this is a
nice little brush and you guys know that
when I do this I really give it a good
rub and then that also helps set the
concealer under my eyes it doesn't
crease even though we've blended up
quite four identical so nice and light
it's not too grungy and dark so this
looks we're gonna keep it quite late or
nice see him another right I think these
brushes a lot actually I'm gonna take
the tiniest little bit of this color
right here just hit build up that crease
just a little bit but I'm just going up
in the air crease into the middle and
then I'm stopping there and then
building that up and belt blending it
out and then once you've got lace
products in your brush you can really
blend that up and now I'm gonna take
this little firm brush that looks so
good actually be really good for
eyeliner but I'm gonna go in with this
highlight color and the palette and I'm
just gonna pop my inner corner that
would be really good for eye
Julia oh I like best brush I'm gonna go
back in with my eyes and really buff
them over this brush now I'm gonna put
some lashes on so first thing I'm gonna
do is I'm going to use my Maybelline
colossal Big Shot mascara this is the
one that they did in collaboration with
Sheila
I'm sure it's baddest black and then I'm
gonna put on my iconic lashes these ones
yeah they don't actually have the scale
written on them I'll show you them when
they're on your garage and I'm gonna
fill them up with mascara as we also
first thing we're gonna do is glue these
bad boys up I just want to show you how
small these are they're so fluffy as
well but really Gorge
I'll find the scale and I'll link them
down below but wait see see them when
they're on so Wes really thin lashes
like this I actually like to cut off a
little bit from the front of the lash so
usually you don't do that but I like my
lashes to be super long if they're gonna
be not so thick the glare I'm gonna use
as the house of lashes glue this is
actually probably my favorite lash glue
at the moment I do like my do one but I
just think this one's a wee bit stronger
so I'm gonna glue those up and say it on
the drone and I'm gonna use this mascara
and you'll see how good it is it's
probably definitely there's one of my
faves I love it and it's really good for
bottom lashes as well you just need to
build it up a couple of times just have
to get these lashes tuck on but they're
taking absolutely ages to dry this time
so they're all cut I cut the shortest
parts off because I do want to keep them
super long I'm just gonna give these a
little stick horn if you watched the
fancy Beauty video we'll see you guys
actually asked for lashes I was waiting
it was these actually need to get more
of this tail so I do like to just set
them on for a little sake and sour
lashes in the liner all the time and I
think this little tool really helps this
is the Tarte one you can also I don't
like this one as much but this one's
similar and you get
called Beauty but I do prefer the Tarte
one it's just got a better mechanism
so once the latches are on I do set for
me a couple of minutes and just let the
glue dry and have a little play around
with them and make sure that they're
stuck on all the places I need and then
I use the lash til to squeeze them down
onto my lashes and that's how you get
seamless false lashes if you guys want
me to do a proper fight you on how I
apply lashes let me know down below I
was gonna put this down on these but I
actually don't need to but sometimes
when I'm reading cannot later lashes I
do like to put some mascara on them to
bulk them up the only thing is if you do
that you don't get as many wears out of
them so you could wait until they're at
the end of their life and then do that
yeah happy with them they're so nice and
if you're wondering these are not mink
they are silk so they are cruelty free
which is obviously a bonus coil
renascent close out I'm just gonna do
Matt Franco okay sorry I am amazing to
find you look much bigger than they did
before I'm gonna actually pull a little
bit more bought mascara on far let's I'm
gonna use my lyre lip pants and vitamins
okay it's my all-time favorite I
absolutely love it so I'm just gonna
line my lips
and then I'm going to use so I don't
have even a little even told you there
this is no shade by Katie and Daisy for
dose of colors very exciting and it has
a gorgeous nude Whitley see really nice
texture as well and then I'm going to
use my finger just to Pat that in and
make sure that the Latinos not too crazy
and then that so now is a really
gorgeous nude it doesn't make your teeth
look yellow it's super white which I
absolutely love but you know what I
actually really love the other shades as
well and no creamer please both of them
are like gorgeous nudes definitely two
of my favorite notes at the moment and
that you guys as the finished look I
think this is just super basic this is
definitely like one of my everyday lips
I do look like this an awful lot but
it's just one of my favorite looks
I love soft I feel lash and in a nice
matte lip it is my favorite obviously
I'm obsessed with this foundation I
cannot get my hair dry yet and obviously
the glue is like gorgeous I just wanted
to ask into like super bright today and
I feel it with accomplish that day thank
you guys so much for watching I really
hope you liked this video and other than
that I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
