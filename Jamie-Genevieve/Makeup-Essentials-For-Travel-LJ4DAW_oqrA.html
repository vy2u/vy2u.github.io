hi welcome back to my channel today
we're going to do something a bit
different you may notice the background
behind me is different to where I
usually am I'm in Paris right now I am
in Paris where I am Sam sounds to be
working right now so I thought I would
utilize my time wheel and get ready
we're done you'll notice I'm gonna
ignore the fact that I'm not done ever
doing about a month okay okay let's jump
into this so because I've been traveling
so much recently and I have been pretty
much living out of a suitcase and if you
watch my videos already you'll know that
usually I have a huge makeup day squares
my drawers and all the makeup that I
could have dreamed for and now I have
managed hinder into my entire makeup bag
into this so I found that somewhat
impressive and I asked you guys on
periscope how you feel about me maybe
doing a little video on how I pack when
I'm traveling and you guys are like list
it okay so first thing is brushes and I
have old brushes I use in here I have a
safety video I'll link it down below on
my favorite brushes and I'm not going to
go through all of these basically the
way I decided what brushes to use I
start and did my makeup just like that
every brush I used or that I went to
look for after I used it I put it in a
separate bag so by the end but I used
every single brush that I would need for
my face but I didn't over pack so I have
one foundation brush one powder brush
one contour brush one highlight brush so
what I do I have loads and multiples
apart from some eye brushes but I find
that quite a good way to get your gate
kind of what brushes that you're going
to need and this is just in our key cool
mesh bag so it's super it's good for
traveling because you can condense um
right though another thing and that I
like to travel with is my little plain
bag we also don't have Sephora and the
UK when you're enter photo in the States
or in Europe I suppose sometimes in what
they do is they do beauty on the fly by
so if you buy three little travel-size
monies they give you one of these bikes
for free and the airports are pretty
chill with these so all I've gotten here
am as my Bobby Brown face paid I use
this everything I just love it you'll
know that you know me and my foundation
so that's the only things I keep in here
the foundation I'm using at the moment
and have been using for the last few
weeks as a dream there too is to so I've
got the wire sale tissue claw and bd6
today this is the new formula it is so
much better than old formula and I'll
mix one pump of that with one pump of
the Baker ultimate coverage foundation
which I get from cult beauty and
initiated these two are my life I've
been reading these and obviously the BD
60 the wire sale is super dark and the
tan one just kind of matches me but I've
been winning tan recently in so it's
really good I can kind of mix custom
blend machine I should have done this
before I started recording I'm sort of
practice so my little bag that I am
obsessed with as a Victoria's Secret
ridiculously garish and your face layer
planet makeup bag and I think it's more
of a toiletry bag but it just looks like
in a little mini briefcase but it opens
up and it's got one of those handy
things so you've got clear pockets
you've got two big pockets I tend to
keep my face stuff in one and in my eyes
and lips and the other and then this is
a really cute little pouch that I just
gonna keep my my personal objects my
pill and tampons for example what I'm
gonna do is I'm just going to go through
like huh I say that I condense my stuff
pretty well when I look at it there's a
lot of makeup in here a good few people
have said wow you don't carry that much
makeup I thought you're gonna carry so
much more so I am frightened myself so I
showed you my primer and my friend
Dacian the next thing I have in here I
have the Charlotte Tilbury itself star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow this is a really beautiful
contour and highlight palette a little
bit more natural than what I'm used to
but this contour color is it it's the
one part Park Avenue princess matte
bronzer
this is great because you can build up
to be super dark obviously I've been
wearing tons of tan so I'm kinda dark I
am yeah great bronze oh this is the the
balm Bahama Mama contour powder this is
a really good all-round powder because
you can use this for contouring I makeup
is beautiful and it's a really nice
Ashley torn so it's fine for oh I feel
like I've got dog here I know when I'm
not far away this is crap
drop out you followed me everywhere you
can also use this for face contouring so
like nose and kind of like eyes and
stuff as well so really like that the
new LM mask a highlighter this is this
is the beyond powder and oMG as like did
I whale little well and then I've got
the hourglass ambient lighting powder
and luminous light I tend to save my
entire face with this that is why I will
like the Sun eyeshadows probably what I
thought was going to be the most
difficult and it's totally fine all I
brought was the tartlet emblem palette
which is tartlet - it's one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes of all time
I have this on today mixed with a new
palette I bought because France have all
of the peach palettes so this filled out
everywhere and then there's actually
hundreds here so I got this I actually
love it so I have this on today mix so I
didn't bring this with me though so all
I really brought with me here was the
Tarte lip palette and when I was in LA I
picked up two of the Anastasia palette
and I just have like a nice mix of
shades and both of these am i well lust
the colors that I packed down below but
I've been using these today they are
amazing like so so good and these are my
new kind of favorite things right now
it's the new style of eyeshadow that
everyone's bringing out I've got three
different brands here and it's one
that's called the kind of primer on top
and a sticky base below so I have the SD
a dirt in metallic shadow cream and
powder in aqua nova if you follow me on
instagram it was the green eye that i
had on one day and you would know
because I always do neutrals
one green eye student a sore thumb the
sunset bytes of the colors it's just
like a super bronzy gold when then Sam
made me buy the Tom Ford cream and
powder eye color and this is a naked
blonde and it is as it were sixty two
dollars I don't know
yes unfortunately is actually it's
beautiful
let's I'll talk about that too more
highlight and products well actually I
should probably mention this in this is
amazing for traveling I don't know what
to do it anymore though this is the Mac
light sleep and she'd stir sculpt and
shape powder jewel and I've been using
this today so i powder underneath my
eyes with this and then i conjure it
with this it's been great highlighting
products I showed you the Illamasqua Kat
Von D thunderstruck obviously because I
spent too much time with Sam Becca opal
it's finished it's like a gold Regina
sage which is really upset and so I've
not been using this as much but in the
mark G hopes what is it a glow sec oh
man it's just like one of the best
things I've ever purchased in my entire
life
so I what I do with this is I pass it on
to my cheekbones and then put powder
highlighter on top I'm just gonna set
like this for a while so you can
understand why I'm obsessed
I have boring stuff here which is things
that you just need that you might forget
Kat Von D tattoo liner for your Flex
Anasazi adecco for your brows I use dark
brown and I prefer medium brown right
now but I don't have it laying little
Paint Pot by Mac for hitting my eyes for
shadow it lash glue this is the jewel
glue that you can get in the States and
it is it comes with a twist top and I
can advocate so it's latex free and it's
got that blue hue to it so this is my
favorite glue of all time mascara better
than sex mascara from Too Faced
love the iris junior agent concealer and
custard ah gimme brow and medium deep
and then I define one blush oh because I
really well use blush every do but just
a tiny a little bit and it says the
turret could as my blush oh I love these
blush rose I'll go through like one a
year
i but i love them so that's like the
kind of mostly like although came aboard
and stuff as for luck colors I just
brought tons and nerds so these are my
favorite nerds right now I have Kat Von
D born adore this is the best first one
i bought i lost within an arrow so I had
to buy another one the second product
got here is Marc Jacobs this website is
called sore neck truth it's just a
really gorgeous pinky nude I'm so sorry

I have one right now is from Beit Beauty
I hadn't heard of this until I went to
fold out in Canada I bought wine this is
the sheath honeycomb and it is such a
beautiful honeycomb notes

that you can pretty much eat them
they're so natural so I really like that
the glossy lip paints and obvi I've been
winning this to death from Tarte and
then obviously I've got a little Mac
flesh port
lipstick and there is veil they
genuinely all are nude
I don't know what you want me to say
that's just my life and then obviously I
have the boarding stuff like a pair of
safety scissors for cutting eyelashes
