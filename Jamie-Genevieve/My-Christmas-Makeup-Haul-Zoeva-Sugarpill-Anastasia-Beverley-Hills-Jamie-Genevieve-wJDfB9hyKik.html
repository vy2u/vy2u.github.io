Christmas everyone
hi guys many classmates so as promised
I'm going to be doing my whole video on
the lovely things I got for Christmas so
it's been a lovely morning I'm currently
at my mom's house so that's why I see no
need to be but definitely obviously
Christmas tree up and all that it's very
festive and I'll make this short and
sweet because I want to eat and drink
because it's Christmas so starting off
with one of my first racence was the
sparkle baby palette it's by Lee sugar
phone so I'm very excited this is my
first piece from sugarpill mi never had
anything before and this palette is
beautiful sparkly palette and the sheets
are kit included frosting candy crush
and hotsy-totsy hotsy-totsy so as you
can see the pigment is absolutely unreal
so beautiful oh my days there you go so
those are the four shades I'm sure you
see like some Instagram of these colors
and obviously had to choose what look to
do today which is one of the hardest
things overdone relief but these are the
shades from the sparkly palette so I
cannot wait to use them the Penguins
unreal as well I think it'll last me
just the shadows I like that size so
amazing next is another palette that's
again first product famous brand ever is
louisvil this is the rule palette and I
actually was watching Samantha on
YouTube and she was using this palette
and I thought it looked absolutely
amazing and that's it there yet I really
like the packaging for this is where I
always did some oh by getting the shards
always a really good size and really
variation of colors as well and again
Pegman it's absolutely unreal so this is
actually the palette I've got on today
so I use a mixture of this this this
this doesn't so like the whole top line
basically in a we better there they can
a blackish shades so you've got you can
a warm reds and then you put your colors
underneath but any amazing Pegman again
I once watch a look there's so many but
I'll show you like the price or like
that's the red be it I'll show you the
green I'm really excited about the
cleaner actually I don't wear much clean
and like even the dark shade like see
this brown it's got a caffeine gold
shower to do it but there are amazing
and the peg roots are so good let's wake
that with my jeans okay
next I got finally next jumbo pen so now
I know that next is in my ex I don't
know
I know it's American brands and I never
thought you could get it in the UK at
all but next clothing actually stock it
as well which is good so I went and
there at million times and they were
always sold out this pencil and then
last week I found one and someone had
taken a parka and I don't know what
rubbed it all over the face and it was
discussed and so I couldn't bring myself
to buy that one but I got for Christmas
so this I've seen loads mica prior to
use this as a base but that eye shadow
so they cannot drawn like this you can
see how bright that is it's super white
so see imagine you you use that as an
eye base put your eyeshadow on top it's
going to look so much greater and also
for highlighting and things like that I
think it'll be amazing
so that one is called milk and it shades
six all four but you get that online as
well obviously the majority of this
makeup I know came from Beauty b.com no
they are really good for people in the
UK like myself who love all this makeup
but can't get their hands on it and
their portaging packing is not that much
either I don't think I don't think it
was anything I think it was free which
is amazing next brush cleaner
Japanese no I've not used their and
I
actually not even looked in the same
school that's still a little unpackage
but I've heard amazing things from there
someone came in to work out to
illamasqua so I came on to my cocoa and
they've just beaten so spacing key
obviously I had to ask holes in their
bag and he pulled out this and he said
it's the best thing ever I saw me being
me pillar on my wish list and my wish
list just so happens to be on Pinterest
and my mom used my Pinterest don't get
me set foot in the movement
so japonesque solid brush cleaner gentle
got milk cleansing balm much of it the
goat milk thanks also not vegan then but
obviously something must work like this
and it says moist in the brush hand and
swirl gently over the bouncer face until
form has lifted a whiff and he phone was
left it away any visible impurities
rinse the brush and leave to dry
naturally great okay so it's like a
solid cleaner beautifully that is a but
I will use this and I will report back
I'm very excited about it because my own
brushes it a little bit neglected
nowhere else back also get a Mac bit for
Christmas always and that's as soft
ocher Pro Longwear people so this is for
loads of people use as a base notice
that's when you're either but it's a
beautiful can attend she's almost but I
think of use I'm buzzing to user let's
watch her
I hate ruining things he was so fresh
nice not to December to move include
scanner shades
it'll be nice it'll be nice highlight as
well under my brow but I've actually I
knew a watchmaking all the time and glam
and Gordo and youtuber actually and she
uses that's the important so that's what
made me want him and in her eye makeup
over state or when I think always and
she uses it to Caribou or braids as well
I hate that looks awesome this was a
surprise a games on my pin choice but I
didn't think it's going to get it and
it's as a weaver brush name so I think
this is the luxe it but it comes in this
beautiful bag look at that pan clearing
to do
and really good selection here I saw
I've already used some of these this
morning and so they're better already
they're beautiful like that stone brush
the dream locks pencil brush sorry and
got a lovely crease brush as well I've
got cream cheek so this would be good
for my team culture when I use my
concealers
I've got soft definer definitely to be a
blades and I just don't know what to
find means but definitely be a blending
brush there's another Blanes there's a
buffer so it's like a concealer one
amazing for highlighting again or I can
use under my eyes and then I've got
highlight brush now this is just like a
really nice fluffy one I can see me
using this as a contour brush as well
not use in earthy especially if I'm
truly buzzing about it then I've got a
simple brush which is awesome because I
actually haven't really dialed much and
Stefan I like buffing brush is better
but I will use these in a put back and
then obviously my angle brush which I
used this morning to put on my Anastasia
Beverly Hills
finally deadblow murmured and the
colored I got was chocolate
I used this morning and I actually found
up a bit difficult but I can see me
getting used to if you know what I mean
and really like a really really me use
quite a bit over try to get used to it
but I think once I get once I give it a
goal a few times I'll get you a certain
it'll be it'll be sweet perfect and I
got myself a present on this thing cuz I
was doing and it came in the post days
early which I'm doing both these are my
favourite eyelashes I've heard from
Eldora you order them online and there's
someone expensive
unlike for example I'm using them today
so these lashes are their h-11 ones but
I got loads of different ones to try
like bag chunky ones like wispy ones as
well like more natural ones double
layered as well and then these ones I'm
not gonna go to ones I put in a natural
look but obviously if you want to see
how these look look at my Instagram I
will hashtag whatever ones amusing so
you can have a lake but they keep so so
fast the girls are lovely as well the
people that run the company and there
are some help when they'll be really
supportive to me use veils so I thought
I'd order my own ones which I love and
then last but not least this isn't
technically makeup but I got the John
Polk ulti the new pair of Minaj they've
got on your sign it's beautiful so if
you use jean paul gaultier very little
be bored everyone I usually get the
Parfum Eau de Parfum and put this a bit
stronger but that's what it's called in
teens so it's like 10 things strong it
again cuz I love a strong perfume but
it's beautiful absolutely glorious and
that is all that we make up bet so good
so we quick video on that also I got
other things as well I got beautiful
things for try space I'm very very
grateful and but I would love to know
