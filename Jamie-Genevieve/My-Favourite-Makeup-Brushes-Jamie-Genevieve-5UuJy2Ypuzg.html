week we are going to do a favorite
brushes video because it's one that's
been equated quite a lot and I've never
done anything like this before and
brushes is something I feel quite
passionately about actually but I hand
packed about fourteen of my favorite
brushes some I've left out the Kois I
think that we're done in the mill and
any will do almost so I've got like I've
got loads and loads of brushes but these
are just like my absolute favorite so
I'm quite excited to show you these
these guys any creative things I'm gonna
see them right now I just used them to
do my face so they're all clean we can
idea yeah let's start off with the face
brushes so I have five face brushes that
are in my old team please I'm gonna
start off with one that you'll probably
already know there's the real techniques
contour brush I use I really like a
first I've had this brush for a long
time so mostly some of them I knew
someone over for almost YouTube but this
contour brush is the reason I like this
brush too much is because you can go
between liquids and powders which is
really important and my book it's what I
use this for is to pack concealer
underneath my eyes it cannot blame that
a that we I do like it for a pointer a
few contours lovely and it's just the
rate sheet for getting right in there
I'm gonna find a nice and close I had it
for so long and you can get these from
like boots or Superdog doorknocker you
can get them in a mini car probably
everywhere Walmart
love it absolutely love it I always find
myself reaching for this the only thing
I don't think about it is the way it
looks I think it looks quick tacky and
no but I don't know I just delete it
I like a little brush and they're bulky
Israel I think that's really bulky at
all some of the brushes go skip oh it
hands I hate them from Mike
because they don't fit in any of the
brush thoughts or late this next brush
is when I only have been used into the
last two days as a semester cosmetics
brush and it is the one one eight brush
I receive X as e present so what I've
seen people on YouTube kind of state to
clear when they get brushes are praising
I got this as a praising I don't think
that makes me a bad person I think it
makes me very lucky person and I'm
really grateful but um yeah identity
this is a weak place and and I've been
using it for contouring with my bronzer
the last two days and it is stunning
I think the size animal here and cruelty
free law and it's math as an amazing
company a little here just fill out
there I don't like that it's been really
good milkshake I mean apart from that
little ones here
and and the product is steps really
beautifully in the top of the roach so
it's gives you just such a nice blade
and I use this with powder blonds are on
top of unpaid efendi show so some things
prosecutable clogged up if you're doing
that but this one hasn't so I really
like it I love the look of it it looks
like are an artist brush paint brush
ring through school this is the other
mascara highlighter brush so I've had
this brush for like two years had this
for two years
and I used that when I worked another
mascara I use this everybody shift on
like up to like 30 people in a day and I
was constantly washing it constantly
can I get the product off and completely
synthetics or you don't use really very
critical you're not I love this brush
for buffing on my foundation so I'll use
best brush most days to put on my
foundation but also if you want to use
your powder play spades or highlights er
your place highlighter that is how I get
my highlighter so strong so I don't use
this today I've got another brush to
show you for that but that's brush is
phenomenal I absolutely love that I've
got I think about each of these naughty
so it's ramallah nice guy you can get
this from Ella masters website or Ella
Mexico dos I can everyone even
Corrine Russell on this it was with a
Finnish person like this this one you
need this next one as a new one to me
and this is a pleasant as well this is
the Sigma soft blend concealer so this
brush it looked like it could be animal
here probably is it is so soft and I've
not been using it for concealer I've
been using it for paper underneath my
eyes so see Jeff so opposed Oh keeps
everything in please because it's super
soft it does in shape and it doesn't
disrupt your concealer so see if you
just kind of Pat it on like this it just
keeps everything in please but I can
imagine see for concealer that would
just be beautiful I would maybe use that
for a contour sometimes it will it's
very small but if you've got a bit of
edge time using that with a cream
contour would be really really nice but
yeah I really like guys this is a soft
light concealer f64 brush the last face
brush I've got to show you as aa
fan brush I hide this and my brush poor
for debate for years and I always it
then all it was I was just like my ideal
eyes I think I've tried to do I oppose
over that and stuff and then one day I
was watching mdz or in snapchat and she
her highlight rosette and it looks
fantastic I got emotional when I was
watching I was like so the next day I
picked this up put the highlighter go in
hand it was the truth it was fantastic
so you just scrub your highlighters I'm
sure you Rita sue me to this individual
you get your highlighter and you do this
and then you just pop it on and that's
how you get it to be the shiny eyes if
you are at all into your meat craft you
will have an abundance of eyeshadow
brushes I very rarely use a real little
eyeshadow brush I don't like them I
don't think the products on the VI Lake
and like packing on
unless I'm doing an all over black
smokey eye which is few and far between
be honest first brush as my only brush
from this ground which makes increased
size and I bought this IMATS in London
but you can get them from the makeup
geek website sugar pill website
obviously because it's a sugar pill
brush this is the sugar pill it's he
pretending increase brush is so
beautiful synthetic animal cruelty free
and more cruelty free cookie that's
brush is really really beautiful for
applying they go see if you love those
kind of bus they make like smokey look
so I really really tapered off into the
distance this is the base so it just I
just love fire I think I use it every
day but I never really used too much
product on it I use this more for blades
and a product so sugar pellet erodes and
blends and if you're blending in crease
brush love that next one is another
element Aska I've had this for two years
as well this is the Illamasqua blending
brush so it really reminds me of the
sugar pill we're not actually a
synthetic his wheel and I really like
that for same reasons but it's a little
bit smaller so it was really good for
working on the crease and those are not
color there it's also really good for
playing tonight underneath the eye and I
use one of these brushes for concealer
and and to blend with brows and to go in
there any eye shadow is real so because
these are synthetic
they've usually can't do anything with
them so massive fan of that brush next
is my little diva collection of
favorites so I've got these three I told
you the retiree tour to the retiree okay
so I've got a cane a long wrestle soft
crease brush soft definer brush which is
a little short bus filler and then I've
got a little tiny petite eye blender
which is really really firm really
really firm and it's one of the kind of
dual fibers as you can see
so first grinding is the soft crease
that's again it's just beautiful bullet
for blends and I and if you are anything
to be proud are you of makeup you will
know how unfortunately blade whatever
bullets whatever it's a two to one brush
I
just always reach for the right amount
of war I think I've used it too I use it
in a pack on color and just with the
AIDS I do like using a fluffier brush
for that even it was everywhere
I did my eye makeup first so I can clean
up anyways after I saw this brush is so
essential and you okay
the next one I mentioned is the soft
afraid Mary approaches the two to seven
brush this is lovely for buffing out to
see you've got color underneath and you
want to pack on I think that's that's
one's good for getting a higher color
intensity the shorter and the day in so
your brush the more color peel if you're
going to get from your product that in
the longer and wispy area brush if your
brush is long and must be that's just
for blends in everything so that's when
should they get for packing on color
love it Tibet's
last one from zoeva is a two to three
PTI plane so this one here is super
small and veins so I love those for
putting loads of color underneath which
I love doing I really like it when I
smokey eye goes right in my eye and I
like it for build up color if I'm doing
a cut crease or if I've got a really
black eye going on I get all my sleeper
from Beauty be those brushes are like
least explains ninety-five each and I'm
getting basically because if you spend
like a certain amount when you get free
next HFN I think the last origin I go up
was just last week and I ordered it on
Monday and I came on Tuesday it's great
it's so good and you get a little place
I like a little people in this place and
the fake one obviously the real one more
eye brushes these are teeny teeny tiny
these are amazing for Chris work and for
blending them into the high they are
Smith brushes there is a
to therapy which is best one here and
there is a two four seven so the
difference between a 230 into four seven
is a two three or tart and dancer and
the two four seven and is longer of my
spear
so remember what I said this one's good
for depositing color and this one's good
for blending it out okay so for my ID
values today onto the last like week
I've been trying a different product
witches and I cannot pay until forum it
blow you guys buy a size of Beverly
Hills and I actually really like
because it's a little bit more natural I
never thought I'd say that and I'm
really really started to let you down
but it makes me feel be a bit like
having about my software play I'm
waiting to see Paris Adama I'm so sorry
so far the real Jamie for me in real
life I love a strong really powerful
blade I would use that bro and I use
that with the Mac to leap brush I had
this brush for so long and I thought
about seven other ones of these I use
them all the time I'm upset it's just
the tiniest little angle brush and I'm
sure this animal here shoots cool here
but it cleans out beautifully and it
works really good with their kind of
tacky product that glow is so I
completely fallen of this but I don't
have this brush in how to do my brows
with that brave I completely freaked out
I'm like guys I can't do it I can't do
it this is fabulous from know Jill's
whatever I do my crown in my halo late
or dark or what followed up from using I
will always go around pedometer up with
concealer just to can I clean up and
make them stand out a little bit more
saw the brush I use everything for that
as the Ella masks angled brush so Ellen
I've got like we say it's all synthetic
brush nose and thing I love about this
is it's just so short it's a really
little dumpy brush and it goes I really
make sidewalk but is that the sharpest
little brush ever I saw it works really
really well with Q products which is why
I love it with concealer so not only
would I use this for in my eyebrows I
would clean up my flicks with them clean
up my lip liner everything I love it
Robert safe and last but not least is
the brush that changed my life with wind
eyeliner I enjoy using a jail so using a
gel eyeliner is really starting I really
like the other masks oh that's my
favorite but the brush that I use is
there's a weaver 31 sex classic line oh
if I'm honest it looks like I really
really long then tiny
lip brush with your winged eyeliner the
most difficult thing is
in Nice and I think I know I can can I
get a same street Lane maybe you get
them two miracles quite difficult so
without just honestly takes practice and
I am obsessed with Hotei me this brush
jingle when you've got your jail and
make sure that you can I work your brush
into your drilling now and then when
you're doing your flight I always do the
kind of base of my and then I'll flick
it up and because this is so tiny you
can get such a lovely little tapered end
which I'm obsessed with I thought I
don't think I could go it with a flake
if it was like a boy ain't I think I
would I would steer in that day that
much has changed my life I can get this
seems day off like I'm myself or my
clients no problem but it's good except
I couldn't do that then I would have to
quit my job because it would be really
good with her and that it's all my
brushes I could actually probably better
the next my brushes and just have these
and be really really happy and the only
thing I don't like is nothing much that
is really bad from all OCD they're all
freaky in different fast
that's right there my little misfit
bunch a little misfit family so when I'm
saying it before I am I go clean the new
brushes so I expand our fortune or in
fancy bloody nose from Mac and it's the
Lord's and things like that and feel
enough they do work really well to get
the product off for the crack which is
good for if you're working on clients
and you need to be like speedy I saw on
Dominique and that's how my dad's
Instagram then they find the salt and
they were like this is the best brush
cleaner you that's in your life is the
jfet is the dream and I was like well
that's all very well and good but you
are from Canada or with Dominique smart
I think Dominic's from it and I was like
yeah well everybody would get this
hello one day I was in tone and I went
and time you can paddle to get myself
something like a body suit like
something something names a weak sheep
from reaching for me and I look down and
I think the cashier woman got pure
freight because I was like why is this
did you sell this and she was like I
don't how much you say and I didn't even
gear I was like is it the trick
it's very non ticket for patents for
patents for packaged by Dassault and I
have used ASIC clean my all my brushes
like four times and it doesn't even look
like have used that at all so this is
doctor dr. Bronner's magic salt you can
get that it comes and I can it almost
looks like a medicine wrapper
that's white and blue and like I said
you can't from American Apparel I don't
know about over in the States and in
Canada and things like that literally to
be sweeps this thing and I've got my
Sigma brush met and all can I called
range and the products gone and I've
cleaned it took me two seconds and see
when they dried the old fill amazing the
third condition or anything so actually
looking for a new brush cleaner go and
get a soap I hope you guys liked this

brushes a few lately sales of ideas
