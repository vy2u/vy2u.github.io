laptop before I get started so I don't
tell you false information hi guys
welcome back to my channel today we are
going to be talking about my favorite
makeup geek eyeshadows so I've had this
but Dudek wasted quite a lot of things
quite a few things in for my my babies
and the UK it's not the easiest thing to
get a hold of makeup geek eyeshadows
personally first I'm gonna say is I
recommend buying straight from their
website I wouldn't go to any other
distributors or anything like that
because makeup geek have got a system
really pushed to the U key and it seems
to work for them let me just check where
the post - I'm pretty sure it's
everywhere I should have done this
before I started recording haha makeup
geek internationally apart from
Mexico and Turkey I would just go
straight to makeup you can buy from
there and not only today as a website
stock makeup geek projects but they
stalk sugar pail and a couple of other
brands they are a little bit tougher for
us to get in the UK and yeah let's just
get started on my face okay
the first thing I want to talk about is
just plain eyeshadows now I keep all my
eyeshadows and large Z palette so
there's a couple my sin bus because I
was using them for this actually will
keep all my shadows and Z palette and
this Feb 1 2015 8 40 party eyeshadows
night at my AZ palettes fill in and I
don't really use much ill apart from
other palettes that I really like or
whatever but I wouldn't go to other
single eyeshadows or anything like that
and right so my faves
cannot die shadow and the most and I'm
not gonna swatch them all because it's
really quite a lot but this is the most
pigmented black and especially I always
do this especially with a beast
underneath that you can you can't beat
it it's the base black I use this
everyday for plumbing smokey ani I love
these three shades this is for
or unjust flow and the darkest one it's
called bettin which is a beautiful plum
late pink which is matte it's called
cupcake amazing for a transition shade
and this one here it's called Cinderella
now this is later than cupcake but it's
got a little a shimmer to it and
actually a lot but I think it makes
blend in I really really easy jobs for
neutral smokey eye beaches and cream
peaches and cream in Beijing cream are
using such a good transition shapes I
put that on all over first and slightly
darker than that is Peach Smoothie this
is a total faith for me pirates I just
used to watch the month that using it
her but it was like a year ago so I'm
Ally or the bandwagon didn't smash I
didn't smash leave on the party with s1
but I am in love with it for your brains
love Coco bear for the warm time so if
you're doing a warm smoky eye go for
cuckoo bear if you like a cooler spooky
article from Walker so that's the
difference there so cuckoo bears quite
dark grits on but more cut as a super
dark brown that is amazing for creating
depth and all over see if you just use
that all over the lash doing for a
killer smokey eye I really like
unexpected so this is almost like a lion
like a shade but if you use this first
as a transition shade then going with
goodies and things like that to make a
killer smokey eye baby face this is I
really like you can almost use this as a
highlight on some skin tones but baby
face is a really nice transition shade
for again it can agrees and blacks and
things like that
my favorite highlight is basically super
bright should prepare pigmented I'll
show you this one actually yes just
stunning and you can build that right up
in which is always good more matte
shades creme brulee beg favorite I mean
almost in between us transition shades
and a smoky color so this does either
black color but I have dry night about
40 bees and my cat when I'm working in
the shop when I'm working in onyx
eyebrow night
these victim fan bactine something else
as well color is so important I
absolutely love working with color and
you don't get much better than these
this is lemon drop which is the yellow
as I'm easing it's beautiful or all of
these eyeshadows pigments are amazing I
could not follow any of them so lemon
drop isn't amazing yellow amazing for
how many times as I said it me anything
I so annoying and lemon drop really good
for the spotlight underneath if you
wanted to get that brightness
I love pulpy I really beautiful dusky
orange-red this is my new favorite
orange dye used to use Illamasqua all
the time for orange eyeshadow but I
actually find the other ask quite
difficult to work with sometimes because
these are like butter they just go on
the woods like a dream this is car
chickadee this is check ID and if you
were to use those first on the crease
and then put a black on top like but
secret black smokey eye using this to
diffuse it as the dream come true this
one here peacock I'm easing especially
with this here which I might use Tamara
and Dutchess so see if your one in a
really dark purple smokey eye you could
use this to dark out rather than black
which I prefer in sometimes you don't
always want to be using black frozen
because that is Fang your looks
I'll start looking the same and it's a
saw the single eyeshadows that I've just
been talking about it which are clean
eyeshadows there are only $5.99 $5.99
amazing I think that translates to like
4 pounds 50 or something like that which
is the cheapest eyeshadow you could buy
I can't believe how hopelessly an
expensive the eye for the product that
you're getting and so all of those are
only 5 million each
you can get says so see if you're
wanting something like that's why I've
got I'll link it below it does cost one
hundred and fifty nine dollars but if
you are starting to love make up some
edits or your star in your felines
career and you need shadows for your cat
if you bought this you wouldn't need
anything else for a long time so as an
investment but it's worth that and
the makeup geek ultimate eyeshadow
palette black so it's like this and you
get 27 eyeshadows with it and they're
all amazing colors and I'll link a favor
those you can would have a look for
yourself also what I'm going to go onto
next is the foiled eyeshadows which I
don't even know how to explain it doing
know how to explain more for these guys
that's why I've gone here so what I have
been using these the foiled eyeshadows
are nine dollars 99 and just to give you
an example of the Pegman let's do gold
tick you really see it so that's one
here for watching Taylor can even
explain to you how much I love this
eyeshadow like have you ever seen and I
got into in your entire life I get quite
emotional about it so and work every
single parents and say asked me what the
eyeshadows are because the waves and
they last all night everyone posts me
pictures at 4:00 in the morning after
this had their makeup on all day and
still there my eye makeup last all day
without fail so that color they are
quartz or untamed massive favorite and
if you are until your color like me
you've got Pegasus which is it like the
most AC electric blue you'll ever see in
your entire life
it's a beautiful lilac called JJ my the
one I had on yesterday actually which
I'm obsessed with is Houdini which is
like I really Gypsy peacock II green so
far you can't go wrong with sober I
forget I'm it's over I think I love
silver high wire so that in the inner
corner like nothing else I've everything
my leg flamethrower are really really
warm brain almost like a phoenix i
should have named these men phoenix
phoenix action on the last but not least
is the one i'm going today which is fine
as a call so just give you an example of
how you the pigment edge with the later
i shadows I don't even know I don't even
know so the important thing those
eyeshadows is that you need to use a
synthetic brush I find
and attending fair with us and say a
synthetic brush the last Israel on top
of a beads try not to put them in the
crease too much because they will crease
if you have a teeny base do you get me
do you get my drift the foiled
eyeshadows if you want the complete set
it's 175 dollars which is again a lot of
money but a good investment and again
I'm going to like all the deals and
stuff that they've got down below just
so you guys know because I've never find
anything that works for me as good as
ice it's great I actually got a sale on
right now as well I don't have any here
which is really annoying but the
blasters are beautiful they're just the
same pigment it's eyeshadow but there
are much more blush type colors and
they're all in my kit and work but
massive fan of the blush shows so
they've got a seal on you can get at the
Vegas lights palette for only $30 and
you get six shadows in them and they're
huge a foiled eyeshadow and Vegas
weights buns or which is 122 all those
yeah I like all this stuff down below
fryer so I hope if you've been thinking
about my makeup I've managed to help you
a little bit and if you have any more
questions definitely comment down below

bundles and things like that then below

you know what guys about so just friend
then maca Kimberly drama queen from me
