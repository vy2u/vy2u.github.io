this is a piece oh my god oh my god
right
hi guys welcome back to my channel today
is not a makeup tutorial today is my top
10 Alaska product so I've been requested
to do this I do a few things on
Instagram mostly my lovely American
followers I think because they can they
don't actually have a counter and any
counters in America do so they obviously
has to order everything online and when
you're ordering online you used reviews
and things like that to kind of beat
your purchases or and so that's what
we're going to do today and yes I know
I've chopped on my heel off that's the
latest update with me I was sick and
then I got there oh and then I went to
visit my friend Anna who is the best
hero sailor ever and we redid my blonde
bit so it's old canal I look at the
roots to Gordon a blue and top to Allah
so they say thing so let's get on with
this so I'll start with the first
product number one is skin base source
can be it's an elemental foundation you
only do two foundations and scan bees
it's what I use on my face every day I
because obviously what I do I like
trying new things all the times or if I
hear a bit foundation it's really good
I'll try it
and I've always come back today so it's
incredible so the color I use is 8.5
they have like 26 different shades I
think so
there's a chart online don't go by the
chart as my advice it matched me to one
so late so if you want to know what your
color is
Google and what color you are and Mac or
a salon or whatever you use and
hopefully like bloggers and things like
that will be able to answer questions I
am NOT based if you asked me I'm an inci
twin in mic what I mean illamasqua I
don't know I've never worked for mic
before and I can tell you in Mac I think
I'm NC 25 and I need point five in
Illinois it's a wee bit warmer for me
but I like it that way the coverage is
Dean is so good it covers everything art
and it lasts all day
if you suffer Leopoldo and plain work
but I'll go into that and couldn't I I
love it I fill it in in love with this
thing okay so number two
are these we're going to the peridot so
this is the list out there p LP 0 1 0 so
it it looks white obviously because it's
a translucent powder so if you've not
used a translucent powder before the
they are right but when they go and your
skin leak they totally go invisible so
it's fine and what I do is I do my film
makeup of de my my brows virus matinee
my eyes thin my face and my contouring
everything and what I'll do is I'll pay
all this powder on let it sit for a
minute and then dust off and if you want
a jury finish just use a little bit in
the center if you want it totally matte
powder your feel fees leave on an
industrial that's every drag queen trick
good laugh time so yeah I mean saying
it's really really finely milled so it
doesn't change this sofa so your skin at
all it does in like cake or anything and
you can use it if you have peanut oil
your eyelids little dusting of that will
stop your eyes from getting oily so
number two loose powder number three
probably yeah I chose all this stuff I
looked because I've pretty much got
everything I do a plate much have
everything from Illamasqua
him but I looked and I was kind of try
to think what my favorite is in Reno
this is the powder blush jewel big
bronzer de la so it's like a proper deep
deep blush jewel so the top color is big
and the bottom color is limited edition
through this palette only and it's
bronzer della
beautiful slightly shimmery deep brown
color and I've been using it everyday as
I've got on today I've got my big brush
and matte bronzer la like both of them
and also because the Pegman is whales
like really really really strong you can
use it on your eyes which is amazing so
obviously I don't have it on my eyes
today but I love using it on my eyes
especially for blame to know smokey eyes
and things like that and your bronzer
ella is also very very very pigmented
very pigmented so that
number three number four I'm gonna
choose fedora so this is a list penguin
is a pure Pegman and it's like a powder
so I'll show you it comes in a little
pot like this so it's got a clicking a
hole in the meadow and that's where you
get your products from and I'm just
going to grab a big broom and this stuff
is like powdered late at amazed I would
probably but there sure yeah so I
actually you can see that but this last
beautiful feels like google Fodor Pegman
for swatches and findings and I use
there's some quite a lot of time I've
got a list of your highlight going on I
buff that into my skin and it gets it
makes a beautiful highlight you can also
use it your night makeup you can use it
your inner corner it's beautiful your
brow highlight and I've used that in
lips to get an envelope like the next
link part in the middle you can mix it
with your foundation I've mixed it with
skin base before and it gives you this
property like luminous finish it's
beautiful especially for things like
that so such like how a versatile
product it's amazing
and obviously I will link the name and
of the product and the cost of the
product down below and their description
box description box and so you can check
out your do next product I'm going to
see lowkick saw this looks like a nice
shower door but not breaking is just
like that it was a waxy Pozzo and the
color I have this fun dose or my heroes
actually it's creates great dark brown
this is my actual color Hyo in is under
and I mix it with a lot over a water and
if you don't know already I shave my
blows from here onwards just so I can
draw them on a little bit higher and
what I do is make them a little bit of
water and I'll use it to stencil out the
shape and it's super easy like it
there's a really easy product to use if
you don't want your Blazers Balmain use
the product driver call it suboxone podo
the products exterior
years on your plate but it also paints
behind Israel so you can use it in a
really nice naturally or your Karen
plastic the bond like you mean which
does cause controversy I will warn you
if you want strong powerful blows people
are not going to like them some people
will have something to say a bit but I
don't really care and there are like sex
colours and ice or if you are really a
blind black here they've got something
for you so love that sticking with the
theme of blows this is only a project
we've had it since I started I think
since the company started by only
started using it recently and as the
brow and lash jail so it's invisible and
it just comes it looks like a mascara
wand just comes out and see for a set in
your brows oh my god it's amazing
so I even haven't got here at the front
partner but I like to brush it up and I
cool products through it so they look
nice and neat and see since I've started
using a I get a lot more compliments my
brows I don't you look a lot neater and
the hair like it just it loops 10 things
better and that's all it says dead sheep
I think it's like 15 pound or something
16:50 movie but abusing it I've had that
for EJ's bubble inside she's recently
using it so that's probably why I have a
lot left perfect next product number 7
and 1/2 eyes this is the precision Jay
Leno and the color is infinity they only
do the one color just now and it's black
so I is quite a new one but it is the
only gel liner that I have been able to
use right to the botton usually when I
get a gel liner it goes dry and robbery
before I get to the even near the bottom
sore absolutely love this I use it for
my Lehner it reflects and you can use
with my shadow brush and Buffett oh it's
a smoky eye B's
and then light some pigment on top it's
beautiful
easy smoky eye oh I think I've used in a
few of my tutorials before but it's as
if a nominal really really good it's
creamy enough that when you use it it
doesn't drag if you know I mean it
doesn't drag the product of drag and you
can
I really make sharp plain as long as
you're using the right brush I recommend
the ELA masculine brush amazing because
you can get the brush source or source
wall to get your flex nice so you've got
playtime with it so if you're using it
for the smoky eye put it all on a wall
throw both it out and then within like a
couple of minutes I'd see it dries and
it doesn't budge it does not come off em
even if you've got the can VPI it strong
is more resistant than others definitely
but absolutely love that gel liner good
job stay with eyes I have number 8 9 so
the first one as I've said in so if you
like black eye shadow you will love this
is the blackest black in America is
completely mad I have had there since I
started at Alaska and it looks new
because when you're using it you'll
actually need the tiniest little amount
and I'm going to have to show you it but
always going at all miss so like
completely black obviously that's what
you expect but it doesn't come off
either so see if you wanted to build up
depth your eyeshadow or you're going for
the whole smoky eyes I can you put black
alright it's incredible also you can use
it with a little planet called ceiling
gel which is only 7 pounds from
Illamasqua
and it turns any powder into the liquid
so if you are quite compact you like are
you good at all
o FF you like traveling light you can
just use your black eyeshadow up with
your seal in jail and use that as a
liner it's perfect and then you've got
your white eyeshadow or I have it on
today it's in my inner corner just a
light dusting of it but the pigment you
get from this is wild as well
super super white and we will use it for
our highlight and on people that use it
in their eyes and I just love it I think
I strive with any eye makeup and you can
also mix it with other colors to make
them a wee bit more parsley so if you do
like a dusting of this all over and then
you put like a like a teal it will go be
but more parsley coloring so for as far
as the way I tried to cause the
what pigmented by far love it amazing
and then the last product I've cooked I
tried to cover an ovary and tried to cut
and tried to pack something from eating
a category this was this was so
difficult this was so hard packed ended
up that creme
so you know my favorite is teas which is
super super light is almost a wee bit
too light for some people so I then pick
that in my top 10 I also love buff which
is like the complete opposite is proper
dark like cannot brain ylq brain that's
beautiful as well but it's not for
everyone so I picked starkers which is a
beautiful note that it does to everybody
a/c and work Hampton me Koufos and
seaweed does a really smoky eye or the
client wasn't wanting to lose something
too dramatic on the lips starkers one at
every time every time we sail over and
worked all the time
actually jannat were probably solve
every Oh sorts rubbish in me seems
go-getter but stark is that say it's
beautiful it's not matte it's a one in
the gloom war lipsticks which are more
satin but the texture is incredible it
goes on creamy it's hydrating it's got
that many but then after like maybe five
minutes a like Matt's dynamite face tone
and at last the color totally lasts M so
if you're not sure about your notes or a
favorite way like me like bold lips
sometimes there are other colors and the
collection there's all those other
colors in the collection so it's the
glow more lipstick to be looking for and
then LM asked was pretty famous for
matte lipsticks because they last all
the they even the tube lasts forever
because you hardly ever had to touch up
with you know me so yes very good and
that was my top ten so just a really
really quick video for you guys
I am definitely like I said you've been
requested I don't got quite like to
expect it was like that I feel like I'm
bombarding you with my words drums in
like I feel like I'm talking a lot but
if you like these that yours let me know
if there's any other kind of ideas you'd
like to seek so we've got quite a lot
makeup
if there's any other kind of top tens or
ever you like to see like top pen
lipsticks or my collection I won't
really don't let me know but next week
we'll be back with our makeup tutorial
for you and I'm going to have your looks
Ramone so go and see if there's any
pictures that you said that you'd like
