not wanted as fully a Zack I'm just over
here oh I did this last time
hi guys it's Jimmy and welcome back to
my channel it's as 20 past 11:00 at
night and this is why I look like after
Janine ever shift so obviously I've just
got home and it's time to take my makeup
off and I promise you last video this is
gonna be a skincare tutorial so that's
what we're gonna do and I'm gonna show
you five of my favorite products from
watch obviously and we're going to go
through the magnet one again but I've
also got the clinic sonic brush to try
as well so we're gonna do have a face
and have faith and see how I get one
with that so if I'm tired I apologize
but such is life so the first thing
we're going to do is take my makeup off
so eyelashes off you see some say here
oh by the way because my skin's went a
bit mental
so we're going to start off with the 95
cleansing lotion and this is from lush
and it is beautiful so the last thing I
use ultra blend which is a really good
makeup remover but an 85 is a really
good daily makeup remover so ultra burns
amazing but I found if I use every
single day for like more than a few
weeks it can be a bit over beating on my
skin it can be a bit too oily so this
has a fresh dove orchid
it's got your line Ewing oil and it also
has your almond oil just hydrate and we
know that and it smells like Tiger Lily
it's people
smells really good so I'll just show you
how good this stuff is it get your
makeup off so you guys been all day most
heart shops
hmm beautiful so pretty
don't be scared look horrible so some of
you may know that I actually worked for
lush I like fur lush and play head and
classical and um and it's amazing I work
there every single agency and it's a
brilliant job worked over no.17 as well
and I went back over classmates and just
to fill my extra time when I was only
two days a week at Alaska and they
decided to keep me every Wednesday so I
Big Show oats my wash boys so once you
have it all rub then you've only take it
off of that hot face cloth so you can
use cotton hide but I like to go over
the hot feet face cloth just to open up
whole all their pores
okay my back fresh face and in chess and
huh so stage one complete check that off
your list and so that's how I get my
makeup off then what I bought and do as
my coal face so cool face as this it's
about a soap and it's beautiful it
smells like like nature so if you're not
find like fish you're gonna just have to
get over that close it's amazing really
so cool face is a solid by result that
you just rub it in your hands and its
way right over I'm over to my hands at
our perlier all over and it has
obviously cool and it which I can
imagine
as dark blue tack so if you imagine
you've got blue technical you use blue
track to get it off cool is like dark so
you put the call on your fees and the
dirt steps the dirt on your skin and it
draws it back out so it really gets in
your pores and flushes out and it's
slightly exfoliating because it's called
little chunks of charcoal in it so I rub
it on my hands froze and then I apply it
to my face I wouldn't use the block
ahsoka straight onto my face so I'm
gonna go and put leave later that one
and then we're gonna use a brush or a
sonic a brush and yes philia where I've
got half an a brain I'm okay with that
I just hated to chew them off so I could
draw them on higher yadda yadda yadda
you've heard assorted before I look men
already know but my friends and family
still love me so it's with you Braca
seconds okay I have the leer of that
cool face all over my skin and I'm gonna
use these two buffin so I've got my
magnet on listens with a peck seal or
version the pink one and then I've got
the Clinique sonic brush and I've not
used this one before I'm going to use it
today see here we go one and I've used
this for a few months a couple of months
and a few months they let out a lot
alright so let's let's give this a go
and we spray each brush with a bit of my
TG water which I used last time
in my previous lush skincare tutorial
with blue each brush they are waterproof
for the better that just as an
antiseptic for any sports I have which I
do I do get the occasional spot and
spray there and we're gonna go for it
we're gonna do both sides at the same
time okay what Jesus
Oh or a clashing oh okay I'm gonna wash
that off and see how my skin looks BRB
ok so I've done that my skin looks it's
a really baby new skin and right so I
feel like it was a wee bit unfair
because I used to cut in my magnet all
unnecessary which is a sight I've got
all my blemishes so the good thing about
it is all my blemishes all the dates
kind of a drainage completely gone which
is brilliant there st. here it's a wee
but it's very exfoliate which is good
but when I was using them I felt like
the clinic brush was soft and I actually
probably after a 2 20 seconds so I think
your only way to use 20 seconds over
your whole face which for me is no I
like quite a Sukkah be it's cool here so
I used that sides of restarted twice I
think the magnet on should one have been
using forever and fill it just the same
obviously it's mortix fully and it feels
it gets deeper painted too much again I
ain't prepare
I like when I'm going for an exfoliator
I like a really scrub exfoli or if you
don't mean so yeah I should mention as
well the coalface thought I was really
good for oily skin which is what I would
diagnose myself islands and maybe normal
combination to oily so for a dry skin
it's a no-go it'll make your skin freak
out and it will produce too much oil and
your skin order school with a joint but
for people like me who have maybe normal
combination and oily
a normal company to annoyingly girl fret
Chaya it really helps comment on your
blemishes and stuff like my my skin was
much worse than this and I'd see last
week I just had a totally ok I don't
know what happened I would ever think
about that
and we'll round up at the end on to the
next product
mmm this is full of grease so it's like
a massage bar for your face and
obviously I'm sure you've all heard of
serums so this is luscious version of a
serum so what you do is you take the bar
and you put it onto the face called cool
face warm heart
so warm up and then rub it onto the face
I just like a massage bar for your face
so it melts to your skin it leaves a
lovely second razor - it's beautiful
it's got portobello mushrooms in it
and reinforced butter is so really
luxurious ingredients and it was
actually my boss Russia little way with
earth you put it on before you do any
masks and it helps the oils transfer
into your skin deeper so the penetrates
your skin deeper and they just already
work better so not only does this
hydrate my skin but it helps control
sebum production which is also actually
even though it's an oil with a serum it
helps muskan balance and it's got
chamomile what is really coming on the
skin so I love it and it feels amazing
oh it feels beautiful
it feels really hydrate and and what I
would do is if my skin was ever feeling
dry or it she's going a bit mental
I would put this on the day before here
wash day it doesn't leave hurry but oily
if it gets
you're here and I sleep in it and wake
up in the morning for my schedule of
drank up all up and it just feels
totally plump in the flesh so we've got
that all just good and then take nice
product this is we've all sort of coming
off but mask of Magnum and egg can be
used on both face and back Jude in times
of trouble or just as a regular
maintenance routine so I have used on my
chest before I've actually got really
been cool just now so when I put up my
chase last night it was almost like
people love I really helped with my
congestion and stuff I think that's just
cause it's meant but I'm using for your
skin if you don't want to use it as a
mask but literally just use it as
acquaintance I would just pop on so
let's get started
ah probe I have blue here and if your
green disc River you can't really see it
okay so once you have that on and it's
up to yourself you can use it and the
shower which I usually do because the
hot water opens my voyage rate up and
it's just it's more receptive to the
mask well that's simply for aspirational
and yeah it's up to yourself I am or you
can have that on when you're not the
shower like I'm doing right now and I am
going to leave this all in for a bit 15
10 to 15 minutes and then I'm gonna go
and rinse it off in the sink and so if
you're not going to show you just rinse
it off late so the most important thing
is that you do open your pores suddenly
so when I washed my cool face off I use
boiling hot water not boiling hot dog
use boiling or I use warm water to take
it off which opened my pores up for me
and I you can see though he was just
gonna help transfer the oils into my
skin so just make sure that your skin is
not bone dry and it has and say it
groaned a Dookie beans so that is going
to be your exfoliator so when I was
putting on you can feel the Dookie beans
and when you're taking it off gave your
face I didn't hold up and that'll act
like it exfoliates oh and so yeah and
here you have honey which is a brilliant
idea septic for your skin and very
hydrating you've got the bentonite Jill
talc and kaolin clay and Clay's really
good for joining tart as well and as a
great Mars just her balance and your
skin I think so and we leave thy soil
through ten minutes and then I'm gonna
go take off so just be here for ten
minutes
don't get it I'll speed this up so you
ten minutes okay so that is me all clean
I hope I have washed it off I feel great
I can feel super soft and I'm feeling
really I have quit a lot of the masks in
my hair but it's okay here and yeah so
the men just get sent straight into your
pores my my entire face just feels
totally clean which is amazing and then
the final product I'm going to use as a
definite moisturizer than last name as
in zoom in and zoom unit is a beautiful
moisturizer happens with a fire on
Paltalk and double use a beautiful
moisturizer that is quite set to see so
it's got such as the oils in it that
help absorb
xa so I also read the front it says a
thing of beauty is a joy forever keep
smiley skin looking at its best thanks
to indirect inflation for ingredients
advocated or an organic a guy over
organic aloe vera we squeeze at each pot
so I look higher though it's obviously
really fatty fruit and as great for your
skin it really really helps hydrate your
skin but they've got cute rings come in
all this alla vita jail obviously sue
them for your skin really common guru
for angry skin like a spots freshly just
papaya mmm cold pressed evening primrose
oil organic lemon freshly juiced are
going to claim another and lame oil saw
all the sexy fritters are really good
for absorbing oils and actually as IRA
blessing it starts to feel more map so
it's a really good one for under makeup
if you're worried about your makeup kind
of sneaking off put this on a couple of
meds before you're playing row or that's
what I decide Ken just like that
beautiful
and that is my flesh piece my fresh half
an eyebrow sporty face brush wise I'm
gonna say Magda thorn I've used it for
months I love it
it really helps keep the stuffing right
for surface of my skin really smooth
really great for underneath makeup and
it's nice and exfoliate exfoliate and
then you've got your clinic brush which
today is the first time I've ever used
it it's a lot softer it's not as it's
fully and and you don't use it for a
long look as long as this one I do like
okay um I'm a Reaper confused I supply
you're not Isis it for a long time maybe
you build up to them maybe I should have
it's in the instructions but overall I'd
like them both there yes sir leopard
print
they are both splash proof they are both
charged magnetically which I don't
understand
I think that's wizardry but this one has
a little magnet that slides onto the
front and that's when you set it in a
cradle and it charges this one I've
charged literally three times and I use
it all the time so it cools the charge
this one I'm not too sure about the
little thumb that they're both really
similar
this one's got a larger brush heads if
you've got sensitive skin and you're not
wanting to exfoliate as much go for this
one if you have created silence again
you like a good scrub and you want to
lose it dearly and it does have a timer
on it that tells you when to move on to
different sections of the feeds go for
this one just to recap we started off
with link to five beautiful common
cleanser that gets rid of prey much all
your makeup took that off for the hot
final call face which was the black soap
which helps drive the dirt of your skin
and it helps can kind of balance out the
skin and it's great for good easy skins
for absorbing the excess oils they move
off that image the brush and then we
went and with our massage bar facial
serum which is full of grease
portobello mushroom reinforced by tears
really exhausted really really luxurious
it believed moisturizer for underneath
her mask which was mask
minty which is amazing for sports tolson
skin and just overall keeping it
balanced which i think is what i'm try
again I think keeping a good balanced
skin it's the key from underneath makeup
which is obviously all I cared about it
do wash that off of some nice warm water
not boiling and then finished off with
her and zooming where should I say I
hope you guys like this video if you
want me to do any more like that she's
like me know and all that I've done it's
gonna careful already but I'm using all
these things and I really really like
them I just thought use the lush
products from the old fat deal but I
don't care I swear she'll buy but next
week I'll be back that's another
tutorial back to makeup obviously and
I'm open to suggestions for that as well
so if you've got any ideas just comment
below or talk to my own Instagram or
Twitter or anything like that and I will
see you next week bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
