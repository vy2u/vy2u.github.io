have no makeup on at all and I've just
finished the ticket office of my face
looks a bit red maybe I should have done
that much earlier anyway this week we
are going to do a skincare but he also
I've been asked quite a lot recently in
what skincare opinions and of what I'm
lovin and I'm what's working for me so I
thought that I would record it and then
I went to touch up my makeup to do this
video and then I was like I should just
take all off and show you exactly what
my skin looks like so this is my scale
like I said it'll be betrayed and then I
hope pecker so as soon as I see my face
with no makeup on I'm like so then do
that this time i dint tweeze my eyebrows
lightly because I can't help it but this
is what my skin looks like it is
relatively clear I've got a few little
scars name like I said pecker so I had a
better problem with my chin and which
I'll talk about but I am other than that
it's like the old little pimple Lord
little sport and I've just exfoliated my
lips which is why they're so red as well
I should have thought over this so in
this video I thought that I would go
into my entire skincare routine what I'm
using right now I am by no means a
skincare expert so there may be some
products I'm using that I'm using wrong
if I am please do let me know because
I'm very much when I go shopping or when
I'm in a store I am the kind of person
to say no no no I'm fine and I'll pick
all my own stuff and it'll get home and
be like hey I don't know how to use this
the first thing that I'll reach for is
wipes so wipes are probably a lot of
people say that they're bad but I feel
like if I as long as I'm going to
cleanse my skin properly afterwards then
it doesn't really matter too much so
because I like to remove my makeup first
before I actually wash my food I like to
use a weight and I find these are just
johnson's in face care makeup we go and
pumping wipes they are great because I
were going to want a makeup and let's
take my makeup off like that super quick
the only thing that I would say about
these is they're very fragranced so I
don't know how good
I'll be for your skin wipes are weights
to me usually what I would do is I would
go into the shop and be like what's on
offer what's on offer chameleon
two-for-one perfect what I would use
next is my cleanse I saw this is the
Kiehl's purifying forming clean so I
love it
I got this plan went about its 21st of
July and I got this at the very end of
me so I've been using it for nearly two
months and they see that you're made to
use a product for 28 days before you
judge it so I've been using it since
then and what I'll do is I'll just
literally with my skin like those I'll
just pull them up on my hands and put on
damp skin and then I'll use a face cloth
to come out take off and kind of
slightly exfoliate Israel and it's super
gentle cool stuffs really nice and
natural which I like but it's still got
science and that's going to help your
skin so when I use this I feel like my
skin is super clean everything's off oh
my makeups off I wouldn't recommend
using this over your eyes and you can
use it something different for that that
I'll show you but in as for my skin it
just feels super cleanse my skin feels
nice and tight and firm but it's not dry
I should have said my skin type is
normal to oily I would say I get oily in
the center in quite often but a lot of
people tell me that's because I'm
dehydrated my skin is producing more oil
so I didn't want drink enough water and
I can I can admit that dad my dad your
souls got me in trouble for that so I
don't think enough water so my skin in
overcompensates for much oil is
producing it and then that's how I get
oily the next thing is kind of like
toning so what I've been using is my
Kiehl's calendula herbal H dark toner
and it's alcohol-free is real alcohol
theoretically dries out your skin so
it's good it's alcohol free and I'll
just put a little bit of this onto a
cotton pad or cotton oval and I'll use
that all over my skin it just kind of
like soothes my skin it takes away any
kind of leftover dark that I might mess
and yeah it just leaves my skin feeling
super tight super firm and really really
clean I love the way it makes my skin
feel especially before moisturizer
another product I've been really loving
which has so much hype right now
everyone seems to be using it as
the pecs igloo tonic so I use this as
well as my toner and I don't know if I
made it do that but I do so I'll use my
toner first and then I'll use a cotton
pad again with a bit of this on it and
I'll use it all over no you go to school
as a spy percent glycolic aloe vera and
ginseng basically it does what it says
the ten it makes your skin glow it's got
a slightly glycolic acid it gently
exfoliates to remove dead skin cells
which is exactly what I need because
it's almost like exfoliating with a
toner and it says that it evens out your
skin tone for the brighter clear
complexion and that is exactly what I
feel like I've got from it so my skin
you're still I use how crazy redness
right here and and like really my nose
area especially this I don't know if
it's this over the combination of all
these things but it feels like it's
really working for me another product
I've been really liking is the Kiehl's
itis extract activating treatment
essence I can't see these things and
what you do with s as you get a couple
of drops on your hands rub them together
and then you can apat over your face and
down your neck once you drop your hands
and then Pat it on it absorbs super
quickly and it just like is like a boost
of hydration for your skin and it entire
gene as well which I I'm feeling I'm
going to go into iTunes now because
that's exactly what I would do next in
my two favorites are the tarte maracuja
c brightener eye treatment and the
powerful strength lane reducing i
brightening concentrate blah blah and
i've been using both of these they are
both really really good in or different
ways the tarte one's creamier so it
comes at a poor and I have gone through
one of these already on my second pot
it's just create super hydrate and it
takes away the liquid dryness Ranger
eyes it makes them look brighter I've
found as well really weirdly my
eyeliners been going on a lot better
since using iTunes I never used to use
eye cream so my eyes were always a
little bit kind of dry but I like to use
this one at night because it's a bit
thicker and then I'll use the Kiehl's
one during the day so the kills it's
like a pump and it's super creamy that
was like that's far too much I would do
a half pint for both my eyes
it's a super high tree in it but it's
much more like wheat which I like for
doing the D because obviously I'm going
to be going in with makeup so I don't
want anything but too much raised at you
the tyrant run at nighttime it's perfect
because it's almost like I need to look
at man school more I feel a real
difference in my eyes in hydration how
they feel they're not so puffy looking
and my dark circles aren't a lot better
I mean I've been up since eat and it's 9
o'clock at night right now and yeah I'm
feeling good with these products the
next thing I'm going to talk about is a
lip here so the two products I've been
using are the Tarte lip facial which
comes like a stick which you can kind of
roll up and it is so good it's so
bizarre because when I put it on I
didn't think it was going to have
anything in it I thought it's going to
be like a lip balm but it is it feels
like sand almost so you rubber on rubber
on rubber on the Canoga dirtiness takes
away any kind of skin and it's super
hydrating at the same time so if you
think about it's almost like I can I
sort of sound scrub mixed with lip balm
so you're hydrating your lips at the
same time as you're rubbing it on and
then I get my lips mmm together leave it
for a minute and then I'll wipe off with
either white or a damp cotton pad not
only does it get rid of excess skin but
it's super hydrating which is important
and if you like me wear liquid lipsticks
all the time because they can leave your
lips looking awful and the other
products been liking is the pixie
nourishing lip polish now what I like
about this is it's a twist top and then
if you look at the tour for this it's
sort bizarre it's got a little Cana
beat some and in what you do is you rub
this on and the little beads
cannot simulate your lips and I don't
know about you but I have got a video on
when I got lip filler so I obviously
have lit fire and massage and net onto
my lips mix the filler react and it
makes my electrical bigger so for me
using that before I put lipstick on is
amazing and someone actually asked me
the other day if I'd had my lips done
again and I hadn't so not only are my
lips super nourished and really like
prepared for a liquid lipstick or let's
stick in but they are also plump to the
max the next thing I'm
talk about is moisturizer saw during the
day I don't like anything to hear the
underneath my makeup so I've been using
and most of us and it's really
depressing because this is finished need
to get another one this is the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched
face piece so this is a product that
I've been using for I don't even know
how long a long time I think I bought it
this is my fetcher
it smells like baby dreams mixed with
unicorns and princesses it smells like
oranges basically it's nice super
hydrating and a beautiful texture not
too sick so when I put that on then I'll
use my primer so I've been using late
for example my hangover explainer from
Too Faced and then I'll put my
foundation on and it my makeup just is
all day so it's one of those things it
works
so if I were to change it so I just use
this all the time I just love it
my night cream is a different story
so I basically was in Harvey Nichols and
Hayden bra and I was feeling sorry for
myself for whatever reason I went up to
the l'americano and I walked up to the
guy and I would say okay tell me why
those creams advanced tell me why this
cream is the best and he was late today
yeah it's like me saying in the science
today you totally like hard-soled it
when I eat already had a seal I knew I
was going to buy it buy was like so sell
it to me and he did I almost don't want
to like this because of the price point
the price point is ridiculous everything
else I've used is its luxury it's
definitely luxury brand
I do like using virtually skin care I
feel like you get what you pay for with
skincare and not that I don't think the
drugstore brands are bad asshole and I
just like my luxury skincare I just I
think it's nice and I like hitter
looking after my skin because I feel
like when my skin looks nice my makeup
looks things
so this Jarrah is 30 miles and of course
108 pounds Jack was in the shop with me
and I was like go and look at something
else bought it was age again I was like
yes how that's cool so the guy pretty
much saw
it to me I went back to the hotel or
soon in Edinburgh and and I did a
cleanse
a mask and then I put this moisturizer
on and honestly my skin was glowing and
then the next day I woke up and I had a
monster party on my chin and I was
raging I was like oh my god that was the
moisturizer that that that I was like I
can't believe it I've been robbed I've
been robbed for something that's gonna
break me out so I had a couple of days I
feeling mad and then I was like I'm
gonna try it again because of costs so
much money
I'm already I've already broke out so
what was the worst thing that can happen
and and yeah and I don't like the turn
and stuff after using it once and seeing
it broke me out when I'm not sure like
I've never I've never returned makeup or
skincare I'm entire life to be honest so
what I thought it was a way at home I
looked after my skin properly I was
using all my stuff and I continue to use
this once I used it during the day
underneath my foundation and my
foundation slid around all day so I was
like not not doing that not going to use
it during the day you only need the
tiniest little bit of this as well
tiniest little bit and I think the guide
said it should last me between 12 to 14
weeks or something so what I started
doing was I cut out my morning routine
and I just used at night time and my
skin's so good from it
honestly I wake up in the morning and my
skin is so hydrated it's not oily its
hydrated it's just been really really
great and I get excited emic putting on
my face so do I think everyone needs it
definitely not it's a complete luxury
purchase and you could go and get any
other kind of moisturizer that you
wanted but this is really nice and I'm
sorry now I'm going to talk about is
sprays so like face spritzes in first
one being at the manual Badescu I'm
sorry if I butchered that pronunciation
it's the facial spray with aloe herbs
and rosewater and this is my third
bottle of this I really love that
I get that side spanking I could fly
with it and I can't because it's 118
mils which is annoying but you can get
that size you can get a bigger size and
this is just really beautiful at cams
your skin right down it still adds
hydration and it takes a redness a lot
it smells really really fresh and
uplifting and if you can I had a sample
size of this when I ordered from occult
Beauty and it was perfect for flying
because I would have it in my handbag
and whenever I was feeling a bit dry I
would just pull it out a couple of
sprays and I was feeling fab so I've
been using this for quite a long time I
long a long enough time to know that I
love it and I'll continue to use it I
scrub that I'm going to talk about which
I don't have in my hands because a
verenao and a three packet is the lush
cup of coffee face scrub if you watched
my skincare video from it must be like a
year ago or more and I love a cup of
coffee food scrub it's stunning
it smells like coffee if you hate coffee
you just have to get over it and use it
anyway and it is the screwiest most best
scrub ever I love it Tibet it smells so
strong with coffee which I really like
you rub it in your hands and put on damp
skin and you just kind of rub it in and
exfoliate it gets a we hold it's kind of
super scrubbing which I like my skin's
not too sensitive so I can really have a
thit and then once I put it on I'll
clean up another lid on top and I'll
just sit and chill for 10 minutes in the
bath and then a wash off and it's just
the base for getting rid of dead skin
well I wish I had it here imagine I'm
holding a tray purse and I'm like yeah a
cup of coffee it's it's amazing I just
love it so much and I've loved it for a
long time so if you can swing by your
nudist lush store they're really good at
giving out samples so if you're not sure
this for you get a little one to try it
but if you think you'll love it get the
biggest part they have because it is the
base and then another mask I've been
using which I really like is the keels
rear air deep pore cleansing mask and
this is what are those masks that come
to solid and working through it is I've
been using a foundation brush like your
classic flat head foundation brush and I
pick up the product and then I paint it
on my skin and then I'll just leave my
skin
fifteen minutes until it's dry and then
I just kind of use my face cloth set it
on my face so it kind of dampens it and
then I'll use exfoliate in kind of
circular motions just to get off and
then rinse my face and it's just been
it's just one of those masks that after
reviews that I feel like any kind of
open pores are tighter my face feels
completely cleanse like really really
deep cleanse and also like any kind of
like blackheads or draw stuff seems
minimized and I think it really could
have does work behind the black in and
pushes all out helps eliminate debris
and dead surface skin sale accumulation
that can clog pores and leave scale skin
looking dull and imagine I just getting
all that crap off and just been like ah
cooling so I only really use this when
my skin's really lacking that kind of
gluey nice that can a nice picture see
whenever it's looking to be a bit too
dull that's when I'll throw this on and
I'll just get myself a little pumper
okay you guys that is it for my skincare
favorites of the moment
I probably forgot something in there all
year to have remove an eye makeup a
little my sailor water this is the garni
one is super inexpensive and every time
I see this little travel bottle size I
can't help but buy it and I really like
it it just gets rid of all my makeup and
I just use it on cotton pads or if I
have got tons of like lash glue build up
I'll use it with cotton buds and just
kind of like work are we at it but I've
been really loving that as well so
that's me I actually done know em I hope
you guys like that I hope you weren't
too terrified with my bare face oh it's
video in its entirety
I'll less everything down below because
I'm sure that a few of you will not
understand what I said considering a lot
of these things have long names and I
have a accent so I left everything down
below with length so it's super easy for
you and if you like this video let me
know if you would like me to actually
show you me using these products let me
know and I hope you have a great day or
night whatever you are in the world and
