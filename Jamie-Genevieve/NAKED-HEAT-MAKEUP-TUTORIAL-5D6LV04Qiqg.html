I am going to show you how to create
this eye and rolek using the naked Heat
palette everyone at all I was actually
part of the campaign for the launch of
this palette at this present moment and
time is not actually lied yet but I'm
sure you guys will see it really listen
me and a bunch of other influences got
this palette very early on and we got to
use it
I think the palettes absolutely gorgeous
a lot of you guys knew that I would end
up loving it because of the colors
obviously these are the most beautiful
warm tones
you've got marks and shimmers and the
pigment is fab it's super good lady case
I mean then you might be aware that the
roads are really curly done swatch
picture by a certain magazine which made
this palette look like trap and it's not
a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon
and decided to see that this palette was
trash before I did even tried it but I'm
here to tell you exactly night and tell
you I'm going to show you exactly how it
performs and we show you how to do this
look i recently actually going to look
super similar to this but instead of the
blue green glitter ru gold and look you
guys wanted a tutorial on it so I
thought I would recreate that look using
different colors because everyone wants
out me for using warm tones all the time
here you go here's some blue and green
throw that in the mix it's a shame
because you'll see later on in tutorial
I actually do struggle with the glitter
portion of it I basically layered too
many products and it starts moving
around a little bit by deuce exit and
I'm going to show you the whole thing
that if you're saying it's a half tone
that does make a little bit more
difficult for me again I might have
finish the look I hope you like it ever
going to see how actually it that I am
really pleased did too this is going to
happen to this the way that I did this
look as I started out with an eyebrow so
the fun thing I'm going to do it my
eyebrow I'm going to use my bro Beto by
or indicate and let's both actually
quite a bit more dramatic than what I've
been doing lately but we are do this as
I get my gravy start this is the shade
dark but I'll line the whole we
underneath the brow and going right
under the here's to the
and you can see them getting that
darkness and then I'm going to do the
same thing on the top and the end of the
braid you can see the nut and duck and
then without just filling this little
sparse bit of fun now I'm going to take
my Liebling bright precise jail and
we're going to fill in our braids just
going through the pile here you can sure
they're nice and thick and fill
carefully stunned and all these little
hairs at the front
upwards who are nice and bushy next I'm
going to take my Kevin aquinas skin
enhancer and the shade sx7 and I'm going
to keep my Smith three or four brushes
the tiniest little brush it's got a nice
rounded edge I spank it for lips I'm
just going to use a little tiny bit of
the concealer I used to use all the time
and I decided I want to start using that
again I'm going to keep the tiny little
bit on the lids and just making sure it
got like hardly any products and we're
going to carve out underneath her brow
once I've done that I'm going to take my
Armin Decay brush the accent comes and
the naked heat palette suppose a
synthetic it's really good for blending
concealer I'm just going to blend that
down almost on Tomales but I'm careful
not to give it too much my crease
it's ghosted brows next I'm just going
to grab my lambo PM pop boom I need a
new one and I'm just going to apply that
onto my lids just a really small amount
and they were primed and ready for
tonight's show the pilot of mutants
obviously the naked heat palette as saw
Gorge it's beautiful and I got this when
I was actually on a trip with urban
decay we were doing some work with the
nicotine palate and honestly I bought it
and I use it every single day for the
entirety of the trip I absolutely love
it so I'm going to start with a shade
chaser which is just this one right here
as in Matt knit I'm just going to apply
that all over the lid as a little bit
darker than my prior marker that's okay
I'm going to apply light right up to the
concealer just to soften it out a little
bit now I'm going to go in with the
shade soft which is just here and then
I'm going to go in with this one right
here soft and then this one which is
called local and we're just use an ass
mess - three two - super fluffy and
we're going to start building that up in
the crease and these shadows are so
beautiful they're really pigmented the
math are so gorgeous the shimmers are
lovely I go to in to use too many
summers and a palatal just usually the
highlight color I prefer to use like
glitter piquant tail
I'm going to miss global which is the
darker shade of shoulder and just build
them out up in the crease as well this
palette is so good for like day to day
lips but you can also like and put right
up for an evening look like this one
cool so I'm going to go ahead with my
sleeve up two to four brush and Zee
shade Cayenne just here cayenne pepper
don't know if I'm saying it right and
I'm going to go under my eyes
although I love it and then I'm actually
going to bring that color up into the
crease and then I'm going to follow that
right round and to the crease almost
another corner okay now I'm going to go
and appreciate and fugle which I think
you mean something like fire and we're
going to start packing that on the outer
corner and underneath I as well they
want to get to that stage I'm going to
go back home with a little below the
transition shade and I'm just going to
use my brush on its side just to help
blend those deeper tones okay so this is
obviously that score I would wear that
every day you know mean the grungy
princess I am nobody want me to shoot
ashes which is this one right here the
darkest color and the palette it's a
really gorgeous deep Park pulse we're
just going to go in the same spots we're
going to over corner and then underlie
and then enter the keys and dab it right
I'm going to quickly highlight my
browbone use any shade out is the
lightest shade the palette and it's got
a really nice shimmer to it but here our
fear that color is like M seen as highly
illness and then I'm just going to use
my brush just to make sure that that's
nicely blended now we're going to go all
end to the leg and a pound a bit of an
issue because if you look my glitter is
kind of sacred it on my lid and I don't
know why it's never happened to me
before
so at the same time is doing this I am
also going to try and fix the side the
good thing requires as you can just kind
of put more on I've got my match reflex
transparent teal some putting on some
more later
I've got a bit of a gluey base we'll see
if that works
anyway I'll show you how it does it and
it's still not working then we'll find
the solution the way I said that because
I use the liquid Minda shadow and the
shade we got bigger like bigger suppose
a
I cannot drew a little almost like a
half cup trees and you don't have to use
blue the lick that I did on Instagram
that you wanted to see was actually
using gold but I've little use gold all
the time so I was trying to do something
different oh Christ I does that and then
I called my little doses colors shader
brush and I kind of passed ahead like so
and then I use my turn
hey we may look like I was on top and
the shades up I'm distortion which are
these ones the blue one and then the
kind of almost translucent but it's got
a greeny
cue to it and then I distract them on
top so let's let you see her let's go
subscribe I feel like I kind of my eyes
can you see how many layers of glare ago
on the die I mean come on and then one
of another one yeah okay so I know what
happened the glue and the glitter is
making them into shadow move around a
little bit but it's okay I'm going to
try off the bat into a glitter on I'm
just patting all those blighters and I'm
gonna have to put another later on I
just wanted to do something colorful and
with a pot latin and then we're going to
add some more blue glare alright that's
looking okay
I definitely like a side bang I like to
see when I look straight ahead so that's
really all that matters
oh my god I'm going to leave it there
and see if it starts moving again and
then we'll cross that bridge when we
come to it next I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the glitch art and
distortion and I'm going to put that
under my eye and I just put it on
underneath the inner corner and I'm
reading a great part I'd like almost
like trace your eye bags go dresser cool
problem
I love this glitter it's like really
blue no that was just green and then I
put more blue underneath as well just to
match the tunes and then I was going to
pass that with my brush again
better I'm going to go back in with the
shade ashes which is a darkest part
petal and I'm just going to bring that
in the inner corner a little bit
somewhat which is not quite as dark
preciously oh my god I'm going to clean
up my lashes the lashes and wheezing are
my lovely lashes and these sheet sheets
and the style can the reason I'm using
these again is because I actually wore
these with a glittery luke already and
when you real lashes obviously the glue
from lashes if you're not really know
the glitter just get stuck to them
thought they cannot end up getting a
little bit ruined unless you have like a
really certain pickle the barrel but
that's why I end up just within the same
lashes for a few times whatever a go
quickly look and then it means that I'm
not like Western atmosphere I mean so
I'm just going to glue these up using my
do clip please actually brush on with a
blue here to it and probably an unfair
favorite favorite I really put some
mascara on I'm going to use my pure
chili charged mascara oh my god
drop by here and my one here is her
absolute agree I was going to pack on a
little debt see mascara kind of helps a
lot and I need to port for my inner
corner so I'm just going to use the
shade items again from the palette and
just going to paste that orange at a
corner this eye looks dark Eric's I'm
going to build up a little bit because
I'm seaman to get there oh we go to see
what I mean thankfully a maybe is need
to wait for it to dry and then add more
that is completely my fault
I think i lured the products on to
handily into quickly I'm going to use
the shift light here the green one and
because the glue is just not dry and
whatever I've done is just not dry so
this will dry out oh my god my granny is
going to get afraid of her Lee
in fact I just got dead a lot of work
went into this last really kind of flesh
is put it on
yeah that go on and be done with it I've
got think about the tillers together
maybe you you guys can tell me what
shared or because that pilots actually
saw flippin gorgeous I should have never
trained in it and just good we should
just do one Brownsville consumer we do
the Melissa failure to clean up good
news it seems to stop moving around
lashes are secure persistence is the key
mushroom okay so then you go wow that
was an effort so you guys that is the
final look if you have lasted today in
this tutorial thank you very much for
watching it yeah it turns out that I am
still learning basically I think what
happened here was I learned too many
products too quickly and too much old
the product is real
so just started slipping around a little
bit but I - exit that has absolutely
nothing to do with the palette I'm
annoying myself opposed I really wanted
to show you guys how amazing this
palette is hopefully you can look past
the glitter portion of this tutorial and
see it for what it is a majestic fairy
princess and yeah I will be like the
tutorial living all down in the comics
