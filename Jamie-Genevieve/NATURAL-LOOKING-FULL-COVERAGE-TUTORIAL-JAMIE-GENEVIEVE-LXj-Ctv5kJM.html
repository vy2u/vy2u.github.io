I'm going to show you how to create this
entire look it is super natural and
gorgeous and lúthien and fill coverage
but unblockable angry i'm going to be
showing you a few new products from my
clinic london the guys from iconic
London reached out to me and asked me if
I wanted to work on the video with them
so they sent a couple of products to me
and I test them on camera for you guys
you'll see my thoughts in the video and
if you'd like to see how I created this
whole lick then please stay tuned that's
not the time to kiss that's the time to
say stay tuned hello
okay so winter is wreaking havoc on my
skin we're gonna create the most
beautiful base I've ever made in my
entire life so the first thing we're
gonna do is our skin care super quick
there's not much to it first thing we're
gonna do is I'm gonna spray my face with
a u-turn tanning water at the cocoanut
tanning water if you've watched my
channel for any amount of time you'll
know that I really like this stuff it
gives me a really beautiful untraceable
tan it just makes my skin look a little
bit more fill of life in the winter so
spree a little bit of that cannot on my
name Israel and it just kind of brings
glory to my skin and it gives me a
little bit of a tan as well which is
really nice because in the winter I am
as the scores like to see pili Whaley
which basically means peel next on my
skin kirilus is the glam go for cosmic
matte or moisturizer I love this stuff
oh it smells incredible
I can't over it I've been using it being
night for about a week now not broken
out from it the reason that I've broke
out as a mixture between a foundation I
was trying out the who the beauty one
which is still honestly I think however
I'm not really leaving the blame she's
all willing to be honest but it's a
mixture of that and then any spot right
here I've had really really bad
toothache for it the last week her saw
and apparently that makes you pretty
coat if you've got loads of pain going
on face freaks out and that's why I've
got blemishes ready to think but just
ignore those the moisturizers beautiful
I know it's pretty hard for me to tell
you that
sporty face but as and then oh my god
tinnitus there was ringing in my ear the
next thing we're going to put on is the
keels daily reviving concentrate again
if you have been here for a while you'll
know that I absolutely love that stuff
so I'm gonna take five drops of that and
the way we do this is we just throw our
hands together and push that onto the
skin and that is a really really healthy
moisturize base to start dinner makeup
on top
I suppose this is technically in between
skincare and makeup but now I'm gonna
use the fan ta Prohm right this is the
pro seltzer max primer and I'm going to
just take one pump of that and I'm just
gonna put it in my center areas just for
a little bit added tackiness because
we've used the oil and I really like
that stuff I've been using it a ton
lately and I've been really liking it so
I'm just gonna put that on my nose as
well and even though it's matte it feels
creamy it doesn't feel like it's
dragging on my skin or anything like
that so we're still keeping a nice
healthy base okay your friend Ahn I'm
gonna use today and very excited to show
you this is the why I sell all Irish
foundation and the shade that I am SBD
45 and the brush I'm gonna put on I'm
also very excited about so you guys know
iconic London I use iconic London a lot
I love their illuminators and their bro
cushions with my favorite product they
have brought these three brand new
brushes so we have the buffing brush
which I'm going to be using from a
foundation the concealer brush or
concealer under my eyes and then neces
the sculpting brush which I'm going to
use to do a little bit of cream
contouring so these are the three new
brushes this is what I'm going to be
mostly reviewing today I was really
really excited at when they brought
these over cause I'm a really clumsy
person I'm quite heavy-handed as well
and I know that other brushes and the
style that have a really really stand
handle and I've watched other YouTube
videos and they just break like the neck
of the brush just breaks off but as
these are proper proper third day
nothing's gonna happen to these so I was
excited I'm gonna try this just now I'm
gonna take two pumps of the foundation
on the back of my hand
we're just gonna play and see what
happens but I know that there is 400,000
of these little fibroids and this brush
which makes its all dance I'm really
excited to try it and if you're
untrained at the art vegan friendly as
well there's nobody all here in these
brushes so I'm going to pack up a little
bit of that product whoa that's nice
Wow they feel that they they're really
really nice and soft if you are a busy
person
this brush could do your makeup and
about two seconds thanks for getting
down your neck as well pretty nice I'm
doing quite a lot of coverage today that
looks gorgeous
the only thing I would say is the brush
feels quite Bank but I'm used to using
quite a small brush for my foundation so
maybe I would just have to use the
little concealer brush on top that
foundation looks so glowy and nice
though I'm going to use the Tarte shape
tape and the shade medium and I'm just
gonna go underneath my eyes as usual and
then my forehead chin and my little spot
and I'm not gonna go over my lips Ava
cause today I'm just gonna doing a skin
focused look I'm not gonna do much eye
makeup at all all I'm gonna do really as
lashes because I just feel like BN wee
bit more natural today so this is like a
nice little coverage natural makeup
because your skin still looks like skin
it still looks typically so I'm using
the concealer brush now they can see
their brush is like a teardrop shape so
you can get right and underneath your
eye
the concealer seems to be spread and
really nicely with us maybe it's because
there's so many fibers and maybe it's
because I put the concealer directly on
my face I feel like when I'm using the
concealer brush I would be tempted to
use less concealer because none of like
none of it got sucked up by the brush
but I was expecting some of it to blood
you like that huh so I'm gonna stick to
all my creams at the moment and the
contour I've so got so much foundation
left on the back of my hand the contour
product I'm going to use is the
Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood contour wand
and that's an easy contour and it's
there you'll have seen it before if
you're a YouTube watcher but it's the
the little guy with a sponge tip so I'm
gonna try it on one cheek it looks like
I've used before if not I just watched
it forgot to turn off because it's got
like this turn mechanism which I'm going
to do just now so that's it or no you
squeeze it to get the product out you
need to remember it to squeeze it they
turn it back off because it's squeezed
and my makeup bag and I took the lid off
and it was absolutely everywhere and so
we're gonna try this I've seen really
good reviews if you use it right perfect
you get some of that and the brush I'm
going to use because I'm gonna have to
work quite quickly this is the sculpting
brush so it's got the cannot point here
and then the chubbier bit at the bottom
that's what we're gonna do so I'm gonna
put it let's just try that mmm and then
I went up with my concealer brush just
to Pat that back the way to lure down so
I'm just gonna get my concealer brush
and tidy that up
oh that was really good right let's try
the forehead
I've made a mistakes to see the top part
the thinner part that is the bet you're
made to have closest to your mouth
I mean idea because obviously you want
the smaller part your contour here not
up here I'm going to try that again
obviously that's that's quite scary on
first application but stick with it it's
nice once you plan to end but that's
quite scary it's really dark okay it for
hit but I'm going to bust this part end
with the buffing brush that's lovely
and then Chen that's crazy it does I
don't know if it's the finish it does
not look heavy at all winter clothes of
the three brushes tried and tested I
think that this brush was good I think
it would work better with creamier
product
this here is more like a gel formula so
I feel like we may be blended nicely
with a kind of beautiful ended or
something like that but cream products
base would definitely be nice this one's
great I would be tempted to use this for
my whole foundation if you need a
smaller brush like especially here that
would fit perfect and then this one
literally than my foundation and about a
minute yeah I actually really like this
one for buffing in the contour as well
so even though they all have names and
the remain for certain places on your
face
I don't think that you have to stick by
those names I think that you could
probably use these brushes for whatever
you want but lovely I'm gonna powder my
under diet with my Smith once three
sleep brush and the locket powder by Kat
Von D and the shade lights just the
usual
and I just sweep that underneath that
looks so good and you can do a little
bit on your letter if you like but
member I don't actually have any product
on my light at all at the moment I'm
going to use the powder underneath this
jail corner justic annotate it up a
little bit but I'm still when you go and
talk with bronzer and stuff so we'll see
what it looks like on top and then I'm
gonna need a little bit pay dirt just on
my smile lines and then between my eye
place but I still want this lips to be
more on the glowy site but all the
powder I'm gonna use I'm gonna go end it
with my Mac it gives me Sun bronzer and
my Smith one one eight brush and I'm
just gonna go on top of this corner and
see how it warms up there is some fun to
be
of a jail / cream contour underneath
your powdered runs I think it does just
sculpt your face that a little bit more
I'm gonna go into my Tarte Pro blow to
go all pilot and just use this chisel
contour color just to snatch my nose I
would actually be canted to use this for
that but it's peridot and I'm only
halfway through my makeup but I'm gonna
say it with the all nighter say it's
free because I find that foundation when
I do this they it masks can just look
super full coverage but it looks really
healthy it looks like your skin even
though it is on the mat side it just
looks fresh still I really like it but I
am going to shut off camera really
quickly and do my brows and on the back
in Tosa buns I just totally lied and
will do my brows right here cause I'm
going to do them a little bit more
natural than my everyday brave souls mu
in glossy a boy brow and I've been
really liking this especially for days
like to do what I want to be full
coverage so my skin looks good but I
also just want to look a little bit more
fresh a little bit more natural so I'm
gonna use the boy right through my
eyebrows and you'll see it just coats
the hairs makes the hair look much
thicker it obviously puts the hairs in
place but it's this thickness against
them is just crazy so your brows look
really natural but they just look a wee
bit stronger than they do in general so
I'm really lucky and a lot of you guys
asked me who looks after my brows I
actually just put them myself I only
really pluck a little bit at a time and
just underneath and that's just my
natural righteousness so I don't have to
make you bleed to do anything I have
thought about it but honestly I changed
my rows so much way I used to anyway I
used to shave half of them off and draw
them past me up my forehead don't know
if you were here for that guys but if
you wear then you are a true orgy
so I've been really
like in this to get my bros i really
made snatcher look but they are just
slightly enhanced that's them that's
them in there and they're natural Gloria
now rather than waiting for that to sit
I'm gonna go in with my precisely bro
pencil precisely my brave pencil I
should see by benefit I'm just gonna
fell in if we don't need it so we're
down here I'm a bit sparse holding the
pencil rate at the back and I'm just
done and it just makes it a little touch
there I'm gonna do the same another side
I've got a little patch here and then my
arch I like to just dark and really
slightly just because I feel like it
gives my eye a little bit more left and
that is literally it don't know why I
was gonna go off camera they're just
trying to keep all my secrets so if you
can see even though I've not done much
my brows they do look a lot darker and a
lot stronger than before so even just
that little bit is enough for mascara
I'm gonna be using the tarte gifts Ted's
mascara I have been loving this stuff
it's glorious it gives your lashes so
much length I knew I was gonna do an
actual look today but I didn't realize
how natural I actually made not weird
false eyelashes today I have never done
that in a tutorial before not wear
eyelashes I'm gon do it doesn't ask
arrows honestly good enough and I'm
gonna do my bottom lashes and I'm just
being careful because it'll have any eye
shadow I'm just putting enough bottom
mascara on for definition but I'm being
really careful not to get any on my skin
because I don't have their eye shadows
to kind of cover it up
so now rid of that stage I'm gonna do my
little freckles so I've got this one
here and then this blemish here I turn
into Fred called to concealer and also
because I think it's cute do you think I
should keep it forever
let me know in the comments below this
is my new favorite freckle so this is
actually a new thing to me it's not
perfect it's not why I really won but
it's the Max Factor
precision liquid eyeliner and brown only
brown eyeliner I could find in a
felt-tip forum there is one from
Smashbox
I really want to
it was sold out when I was in Boots so
I'm just gonna use this today and then
on this one I guess sighing it's a bit
dark but it's okay I'm gonna go on top
Wow pretty sturdy he'll give it that now
it's for another iconic London product
so this as the new illuminator so this
is one of the liquid eliminators you
guys know this is super famous the
original color is absolutely gorgeous
but this is their new beautiful color
called blush and I will show you on the
back of my hand so that is the color
here as super super reflective and it's
a really gorgeous blush torn so you can
use this as I kind of blush I suppose
but I'm going to use it as a regular
highlighter just to show you guys what
the color comes off like damn it I
should have done this you can mix it
with your moisturizer or your oils or
your plane right to get an overall super
glow on your skin
that would've been gorgeous I'm going to
apply it onto the back of my hand and
remember you do not need a lot of this
stuff guys as heavy duty I'm gonna put
it on my Cupid's bow man knows how
pretty is that I'm gonna put it just
down the center of my nose the bridge of
my nose and then we're gonna put it on
where our cheeks and I'm gonna use my
fingers for this beautiful and using a
cream highlighter and the winter just
restores the healthiness to your skin
I'm gonna use a sponge to apply it to my
Tim pulse and I guarantee if you really
this highlight or someone's gonna stop
and ask you what you've got on because
it happens to me every time I wear the
drops some ones I was like wow and that
just adds so much radiance and
healthiness to your skin and then what
you can do is you can use a lot of your
poets are just to make sure the center
is nice
that means that your may have just gonna
last all day but your goal is still
getting picked up silly on the cheeks
now I'm going to go end with the urban
decay laner and broken this is just I
really I look so awkward this is just a
really beautiful note and it's a nice
tone because I've done such a natural
makeup
it basically means I can just lay my
lips the color that they would be I can
kind of overlaying them a slightly still
even though it's a natural makeup and
then I'm using lip gloss this is like a
totally different tutorial and now
you're done your liner what you can do
is I'm pinnacle onto the lip a little
bit cannot bring in the color on because
we're not actually using a lipstick so
this will give you a really nice
long-lasting base color but it's not too
dark I'm sure you remember there's other
lip liners I use that are really really
dark knew it knew it notes and the lip
gloss I'm going to use is the fancy
beauty gloss balm I'm sure you guys will
see this by now so I'm just gonna pull
up that on top there's one more thing
I'm gonna do I'm gonna take a little tug
bitch just one little drop of the iconic
London drops and blush and I'm gonna
apply it as an inner corner highlight
and a brow highlight just to get some
added Gloin s to my makeup as if it
wasn't ballina you can even put a little
touch of that just right on the lids
because you don't have any other makeup
on it doesn't matter if it creases but
it just adds so much greatness to die
right and then I'm gonna add one more
coat of mascara know that it's all dry
okay I'm gonna zoom you in so you can
have a good look at my skin uncrackable
I'm working meetings them because I just
do not feel like myself and actually may
take my head out as well so you guys
that is the end of the tutorial I hope
you like this makeup look obviously it's
super different for me because usually
I'm all of it glam all of it lashes but
I just thought I would try something a
lot with different lately I've been
actually going for this look a lot more
it takes much less time you still have
that full coverage
- your skin looks flies but the other
aspects of our face are just toned down
and it's a lot more cannot show as the
skin is the skin that I love in this
lick so I hope you like it - huge thank
you - I couldn't go down a for
sponsoring this video and getting in
touch with me and want to work with me
you guys are the best huge thank you to

than that I will see you in the next
