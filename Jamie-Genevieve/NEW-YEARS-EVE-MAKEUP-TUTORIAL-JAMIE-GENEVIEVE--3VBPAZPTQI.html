I am not naked
I am not naked I have a little top porn
but I am gonna show you guys how to get
this entire look but I said it's going
to be amazing for New Year obviously
hopefully is fast approaching if you're
a stuck without a makeup look then this
is one this is definitely a look that I
would like to bring in the New Year with
you know start the euros you mean to go
on but I'm also going to show you that
how I shine up my body so I'm not new
kids before anyone asks I'm not make it
so I just thought I would show you guys
how to do that show you this entire look
and I really hope you like it if you
would like to see how I got this look
then please stay tuned hello
I don't know what it was a big Christmas
bye struggle so much to get back to work
so the first thing I'm going to do is
use my new talent or coconut tanning
water that is the only reason that my
skin has any kind of tan right now as
super dark super called snowing actually
in Scotland rate notes so I would like a
turn please
I've already done almost skincare if
you're interested in what my skin Kita's
I do usually go into it in other
tutorials so you can check those out the
next thing I'm going to use is the wire
sail all Irish primer I've used this a
couple of times one of you guys said
that it's really really great underneath
the foundation that I've been using so
would it take some of that it's kind of
like a milky consistency and I'm just
gonna mostly put that in my scented
areas you'll need a little bit of this
because it's that kind of liquidity
extra a lot bit goes a long way
next thing I'm going to do is go in with
my foundation this is the wire sail all
Evers foundation I am B shade B D 45
I've been using this every day for weeks
absolutely lover I think it's my new
favorite foundation I'm just gonna put
this on with my Smith 1 1 5 brush by the
way it's pretty fill coverage if you
want it to be I use about two pumps in
the back of my hand and that completely
covers my whole face feel coverage it
wears so beautifully I've been getting
loads of compliments I think create a
lot of my friends have went and gone up
because of me as well it's just great
it's really nice I think the reason I
didn't you
as much when I first got it was because
it was the wrong color for me but now
it's like perfect it's great and my
foundation is going on so smoothly
becuase I got my skin damper cleaned
yesterday by Caroline McLean who works
at LaBelle forum and it's her that's
done my treatment underneath my jaw
which she might have seen if you watch
the vlogs she does everything she's
gonna be doing laser for me next year
lately we did a salicylic acid peel and
in yesterday I had my last treatment of
Excellus which is the Chen thing and we
did a bit of micro micro derma planning
which is basically the treatment where
all your dead skin and peach fuzz on
your face comes off and that's kinda
like so good I've got a wee blemish here
but that's been festering for a while so
I'm actually happy it's finally come to
come to head literally now I'm using my
shoot Kip concealer in the shade medium
underneath my eyes Cupid's bow just
because it is a little bit later it just
adds like a nice natural highlight and
because of the wee bit of pigmentation
of my hair I like to use quite a bit up
there and actually it's just put we
thought when that blemish but apart from
that what a little spot my skin's been
it's so good I'm so happy and then I'm
just gonna blend that in with my smash
again saw you guys how was your
Christmas if you celebrate and if not
how is your festive holidays how is your
time off work you have came off work did
you get any makeup for Christmas I would
love to know what you've got what you're
excited about
I've seen loads of people tweeting me
presents that were inspired by me like a
lot of solid so you guys got a ring
light which is really cool
lor do you guys we're getting makeup
that I've recommended are you like me do
you struggle to get back to work after
Christmas
I've just been chilling like proper time
off it's been amazing been in so much
pain my family and friends you know
exactly put your minute do learn about
Christmas
it's been great really good but I am so
excited to get back to it
I'm really excited about next year
there's some really cool things
happening next I'm going to do is when
you
my landlord pan-pot yes I have a new one
Maksim Mia Chris who works at max on my
video of me seeing that Adreno and I've
not been into a shop together in ages
and you sent me one so thank you it's so
much back on Molly in low height and I'm
just used then a little concealer buffer
brush from zoeva to pop that on
obviously today is a day of a lot makeup
I'm gonna let me fix there I'm very
excited about it I'm gonna take my Kat
Von D translucent POJO this is a
blotting powder in late and I just
really like to use this under my eyes
this is like a little tart brush but I
like it cuz it's nice and dense and I
can just really rub the concealer end
and it just means we're not gonna get
any any movement through the day next
I'm gonna use the Patrick Starr setting
powder this is called Patrick's powder
it is absolutely gorgeous it's a really
beautiful peachy tone and I'm actually
gonna use my Mac 150 brush for this and
what I like to do is pick up loads of
the PO don't put it in the lids and then
I like to just pop that on really and it
just makes me mad but by the end of my
makeup you'll see all the natural oils
and stuff will have started to melt
through my foundation already it's like
a perfect balance between Matt and dewy
which is actually really really lovely
for a makeup like to date obviously some
of you guys for a new year are gonna be
going so I'm just taking this powder and
that sigh in my eyes some of you guys
are gonna be going for that new year
me and Jack are actually steena this
year because we are off to New York that
was my Christmas present to Jack as a
trip to New York because he just loves
it there we are going to New York on the
11th and I would much rather save my
money and do something really fun in New
York so that's what we were doing but
today jack'd uncle is having like a bit
kind of family parties that's why I'm
doing my Canon New Year's makeup today
the bronze I'm gonna use as dark tan
from Mac I was using give me Sun for a
while but I actually do much prefer this
color for me it's so nice it's like the
bronze that I used to go to all the time
when I was a makeup artist
I used to do freelance so I'm gonna take
that on my one one eight brush from
Smith I'm just kind of blow into the
face it's so straighten my face is like
so smooth from that treatment feel it
and my brush my brushes got nothing
tested and yes I'm wearing a dress and
go by the way comfort at first I've been
living and my dress and going and
mawenzi for last I don't know since
Christmas for you it will be actually
quite fun to get ready today and then
recently I've been reaching for my shade
and light palette from Kat Von D and I'm
gonna mix most of their shade with a
tiny tiny touch of the darker one just
to get a nice contour just a little bit
too much of this stuff is worth losing
and then I like to just use this metal
shade to contour my nose so I'm just
going to go down the sides and then I
like to just go rate and here I don't
know what this part of my face is called
the side of the bridge of my nose like
my inner corner almost and I love
building that up because it just pinches
the top of my nose Lourdes if you feel
like you've gone a little bit too low
down with your country you can always go
in with the later part of the Kat Von D
and just sharpen that up let's bring a
little bit of that one so donor Nick I
know that it is a little bit warm for me
but I would much rather use that shade
of foundation and bronze up my neck and
match my necks right now because I just
don't look very well when I'm this
appeal town for eyes I'm gonna zoom you
a very matte maybe I'll spring my face
just now so just use the all nighter
setting spray I've been absolutely
loving that stuff again home fries so
I'm going to use my luck's crease brush
from zoeva and am I actually gonna go
and with patrick stars palette this is
the palette gorget so I'm just gonna use
this shade just now which is the
transitional shade because I've got an
other palette that I want to use today
that I've tried once before and it is
absolutely stunning so we're gonna start
off with our transition shade and
obviously this is no year makeup so it's
gonna be bold we always need to start
for the transition shade first so little
circular movements help blend up towards
the brow straight away or something
better another thing I'm really excited
for in the new year is getting at my
studio Dyna I think that's gonna be one
of the highlights and a cheer for me is
getting a work space that I just love to
bit so I'm bringing that crease color
right into my inner corner you guys know
I love that and then I'm carefully
messing this part that breaks it gives
you a nice glow left when you've got
that nice and light like I just think
that's so nice Mac eyeshadows are
brilliant I used to use them all the
time I think it's just because these
brands will start bringing out amazing
palettes and things like that everyone
just kind of forgot about them we're
going to go end with the sassy Sedonas
dose of colors palette
absolutely gorgeous it's my warm toned
dream come true I can you get these look
at this little brush for that I just
wouldn't use that maybe a front
underneath my eye or something like it
will come in handy I'm sure at one point
but I just I've got like my five brushes
that I just love that I always use so I
probably won't use that and the first
color we're gonna go in with is this a
metal sheet here drop by pardon me
coming out this palette I will use it
once before oh my goodness the pigment
is absolutely mental it's so good so
just a little bit at a time and we're
going to start by going it in the crease
and this isn't too much darker than our
transition shade but it's good for
starting to build up that piece and I
know this is a warm smoky eye I'm going
to jazz up and I'm using a new pilot
your warm brown eyeshadow here is your
key and then if you need to grab a clean
brush so this is my morphe e to seven
brush it's brilliant really nice like a
fluffy brush and you can just use that
to really help buff everything out and
because I've started reading my hair
that's gonna slip back bun I really like
to make sure that I've got bad guy
makeup on I don't know I just think it
goes really nice they're just using
little circular motions and I'm really
taking my time with this blamed because
I want it to be super smooth really blue
and I know I'm gonna go in with this
color here and it's a bit of our more
like deeper ready or brown and I'm going
to small pen to my Smith I think this is
a 2 3 5 and we're going to go into that
color and I'm going to start going onto
the light a little bit these are a
shadow Zara bridge
the gorgeous Sofia sir and they're
definitely more cannon ready pawns than
your usual warm palette I'm making the
blend really big rate out past the bro
cool I think it's time to smokey oh
underneath the eyes so I'm gonna go in
with my morphe 5:07 brush this brush is
super tiny and I'm gonna go in with the
 I was just using and I'm just gonna
buff that underneath my eye and then
what you can do is you can go in with
your bigger brush and the lighter shades
and just really buff that out I'm going
to go in with this color here which is
the darkest shade in the palette and I'm
actually not going to use too much of
this color today but I want to use a wee
bit underneath my eyes just on the outer
corner here I just add a little touch ik
drunkeness to the look and it also makes
my eyes look much bigger because if you
look I'm going underneath curly red
starts the next product I'm gonna use is
the Tarte chrome paint shadow pot and
this is the shade Park Avenue princess
these have the most beautiful texture I
honestly can't believe it if you are in
a Sephora or if you have the chance to
see these and Pearson go and have a play
with them because I think when these are
just honestly phenomenal they're like I
really suck he can extremely texture but
no it's so strange but let's get it on
my brush I'm just using a little Mac 239
flat brush and I'm gonna spray it with
my all nighter and then I just press
onto the lids I just absolutely love
these and I'm just gonna put that all
over the lids right up to the crease
honestly I just do not have the budget
time to do it quickly these days but
this ghost effect of it gives you that
really makes eyes open look makes your
eyes look super bug I don't think that's
so stunning what a color peel and I'm
gonna take that color right into the
inner corner because if you see that
gives you that nice brightness and then
when you get to the ages
you just cannot say that and what you
can do is you can go back in with your
brush with the shadow and you can just
kind of gently go backwards and forwards
and blend that in a bit
so looking even more crazy now
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in with my
Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy glitter
absolutely love that and what I'm gonna
do when I came here because there's a
bit of a method to the madness so I'm
going on tops you've got that speck your
base that the glitter comes with anyway
because it's like it's almost like a
kind of glue I'm just chucking out on
all over the gold keeping my eye looking
down sorry I can't look at you guys
right now but this is the next glitter
and bronze what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna open this up pack up some of that
glitter and I'm gonna pack this glitter
on top or for putting Midnight Cowboy
and that just gives you Lord more
texture to the eyeshadow you've got a
couple of different colors of gold in
there as well
I've obviously got fallout from the
clutter in that beautiful right okay so
let's do the other I know Midnight
Cowboy first these are great and
obviously these glitters you've got them
in loads of different colors so what you
don't have to do gold if you fear I fear
more adventurous than I am go for a blue
or a green then time in a fall and show
me that you do break colors and then I'm
in the gutter you can go in with your
eyeshadow brush and just make sure that
those edges are nice and smooth remember
what I said about not using the dark on
the top change my mind so I'm gonna go
in with this dark color here my teeny
tiny morphe brush and I'm just gonna
darken up the very outer corner and then
I'm gonna use my smooth brush just to
help blend then we've got all this
gorgeous gold going on about a1 gold on
my inner corner but a different texture
so I'm gonna go in with oh darling
highlighter from Mac absolutely obsessed
with this and I'm just gonna pop that
inner corner then I'm gonna take a
little smudge brush and some of the
powder by itself just to pack on top and
blend out a little bit a love a break
and a corner for this look but it's
still Goldy so it still ties in and then
I'm going to use that gold on my
browbone and I'm just using a bigger
fluffier brush to really blend
everything together the lashes I'm going
to use are
my favorite Nakano slashes from Lily
lashes so I'm gonna glue these lashes up
just plain well we're waiting for those
today we'll pour upon some of the gifted
mascara from Tarte I absolutely love
this mascara I've been using it every
day for over a month I just think it's
brilliant you don't need too much
mascara obviously because we're putting
on false lashes but I do like to have
really nice chunky bottom lashes right
so gonna go ahead and just do my
eyebrows because it doesn't take long at
all the product I use as the glossy boy
prior absolutely love this how many
things I see that and one tutorial but
this is the shade brown and I'm just
going to go through it my eyebrows and
get them all Mason groomed this stuff
makes them a little bit darker as well
which I really like and then all I
really do is go in with a pencil
afterwards and fill in the gaps I just
think a bright like this keeps all the
focus on the eyes rather than my whole
face I think the way I used to do makeup
there was a lot going on at once which
is great but I like to have a full kiss
now okay glasses ready
what I've started doing is cutting off
lace and ice the eyelash so I used to
cut them pretty short and just stick
them on the ends of my eyes but these
lashes I've started keeping them a bit
longer and I much prefer them I think
they're so gorgeous really dramatic like
me and then this little tool I'm using
is the heartiest lash applique type and
I just like to go along and give them a
nice squeeze so they're all properly
stuck on so I'm just using my precisely
micro pencil by benefit this is the
shade number 4 and I'm just gonna bring
my bro down at the front a little bit
and then I'm gonna bring the arch up a
bit as well and then you can elongate
the blow a little bit if you want to as
well and that just takes two seconds yes
Simmi right this is just a little bit
more omega-3 before we do our highlight
with what I've got on and my inner
corner which is the or tiling highly
Mac would pull up that one navel my skin
is dewy fresh oh my god there's my first
thing putting highlighter on with this
derma planing skin right unreal and I'm
gonna put a little bit on my forehead
because we've used the more matte
foundation and powder it's nice to just
add in the late to your skin little bit
of highlighter on the very tip over nose
and during the bridge as well and I like
to just Pat that back with my finger I'm
going to use these from Bleach London
this is the shade bruised violet and
this just a lot of pencil that goes with
it I'm sure so I'm going to line my lips
first and then pop that on and then I've
done a dark lip and then I am also hook
for another year
okay I'm going to just put the liquid
lipstick on it and see how we're doing
sheet wise oh I like this this is like
the makeup look you should do if you do
not want to be kissed on the bills you
mailed on that colors army then make
sure to use label right if this is how I
want to start money here I feel like any
I'm being marshal dose and we quickly
show you what I'm going to do to Shane
up my boards and I'm gonna use my
chronic illuminator and I'm just gonna
quickly show it because it takes two
seconds this is this sheet original and
I'm actually gonna take my big velvet
sponge and see this you use build up I'm
just patting that and you can use your
fingers a little bit as well because
it's sponge six it up a little bit and
then I'm just gonna do it another layer
and this looks unreal and photography if
you're out in the club getting your foot
will say you can this just makes your
skin like super wear and healthy stick
your collarbones I to apply it and then
that way when your wrists and I think
doing this is really slimming it makes
you look I don't know just petite and
lovely and then I like to go in with you
betta bronzer so go underneath your
collar bones and then and see this
little absolutely hole definitely not
hole you can actually just keep on doing
that until you're happy
after so you guys that is the finished
look I hope you do like that I just
think that this is a perfect makeup for
new year like I said earlier you are
more than welcome to swap out the dark
lip for a nude lip I actually really
like this for the dark lip so who knows
new year new me I really hope you like
this tutorial and I hope you guys have
the best new year the base start to 2018

year

life so far it's been incredible and I
