into which is my friend Jasmine silence

not all in G at all only hide this on
for like four hours this morning video
maybe access to Nina has actually yes I
also have the controversy arose mornin
and it gave me such a nice color and
then a link over here done and the
original makeup because we gonna see
Drake next can ban the defense is really
good so I have to dig deep and to my
boxes and boxes and makeup because we
are moving soon and I had to get from
douches that's what even look to match
me because I am really can so this is
the arrow glass vanish thick and shade
golden your elders it's going to be a
bit late for me but room make it work I
will actually use this that much the
closet don't suit me when I'm peeled and
it's been winter so I'll be tracking it
out we look more and know that we're
getting into the spring months and I
fully intend on keeping this channel so
it's fine blender then we'll see what
happens
magic complexion lectures the shallots
nobody matches complexion brush rule as
a good color so the color of users
golden so it's funny when I usually hmm
sweep it dryer can I just use a little
bit my pure emotional mess to tie and
get it movin but there are quick dry I
don't know whether it's got abrupt it
panel not you know curiously so when I
go out I even get really quick quickly
and that's what I'm doing here this is a
game made of me so I'm just going to get
ready to see this brushes sugar and
critter all put in your back I'm going
to go back to my semester one one to
dress up my favorite and if you're
wondering why what'd you do
endo and broken the altars to the mall
events we can also expand naturally now
I'm going to go in it with my shape tape
and I'm actually going to use the color
medium Am I
yes because I want to keep the tan look
you know I wanted to be far too asked
you under my eyes and like I said I get
ready like rapid fire and I'm going and
when I put a lot of love I'm going out
tonight I'm a quite a lot of makeup all
the time by genetically we're a little
bit more when I'm with it was it so
perfect I love this concealer it's all
ready to put a little bit of shape it
over my eyelids and say fit and I've got
my brains already is real using the
Charlotte Tilbury lid into the globe
because time is of the essence now I'm
going to go in with the Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish powder
and I use the shade medium which should
be perfect actually for me to do and I'm
going to set under my eyes I decided on
my my chinny chin chin and the forehead
I would use my room a loose powder but I
don't do too much later when I'm going
out narrow bridge goes straight over the
bronzer and I'm going to use my good old
favorite Mac dark pan and it's a
mineralized skinfinish a ridges great
art yet runs up your cheap one and
record on sweet on their stuff looks
perfect
then they do that my Charlotte Tilbury
paid right and sculpt brush with the
duck turn and just carbonated cheekbones
a little bit and I'm going to do the
usual around the jawline
I don't like it when I'm really timeless
that's mine later and this is nothing
like the subject look okay
I read that enter my neck love contours
old pilot I did a tutorial using this
entire palette the right leader could've
went to this really dark contour shade
here I thought they sprayed the back you
know variable back cameras in max dark
tan and I'm going to skip the north like
a little bowl of a tune since doesn't
certainly
now I'm super blue and I'm going to go
end my highlight this is really bad for
it but when I'm gone oh this is how I do
my makeup I'll actually just go one by
one so I'm going to run with my backup
or pal
my sees and displace the cheekbones and
hope it doesn't mean do it when is
Lately paint off my face and I've
certain office hall games to be pretty
embarrassing the interns were stood for
the saloon you already know that the
10-man or just comes back to like a
little exclamation mark so you could go
in the bridge and then poop and then I'm
just going to go back bring the noise
with the bronzer and I'm actually going
to use blusher today because I'm short
and I'm going to use risking by car and
that is like my perfect going out skin
super go away she's not babe so for the
eyes I'm going to use my melt I shadowed
I love these I know that they're not a
easiest to get but hopefully the guys
over at nail are going to work on that
and color me let's see there for that
one spin ugly that one so rather I want
to do is I want to take the color unseen
you can clearly see it look I need
remembering to start blending this in
the crease when i zoom in a little bit
minute hot definitely and I'm just using
my most typically brush to build that up
same as you shall use in wonder way from
movement obviously this is the latest
color that we'll be using in the
transitioned shades of thing so it's
really really easy to get a nice and
blue no you don't need to worry too much
pretty much for just sitting alone in
order and there I'm gonna go underneath
my eye with the same color in the same
brush as well and I do need a little
mirror and all that is gonna do it's
going to say under the eye a little bit
more and it's a lot of it darker than
our eyes real so it's just gonna smoke
at your underneath oh it's been too dark
and then just blending that on top again
cool I'm going to use the shade rough
day and we're going to pop that
under-eye a little bit just a toe side
right and with a little touch of
excuse and in a thinker max is going to
leave it like that guys do you know that
so I'm Seldon up the clue bringing that
right and record out a flop my brush
over and I'm using just a little 230
brush a little bit smaller and I'm going
to swap back to my bigger brush and go
back and other times I can shade and
then we're going to bust that radio I'm
just going over Chris put the rough
color and I'm just pulling that out
making sure my brush is nice and high
what was the name of that you know I
actually remember I learned that type of
cash big flippin years ago I have to
stall it thank you for the tip - see see
now that makes me quite happy Lak green
eyes look and I thank the column tilt
and it's quite nice to keep it this soft
and neutral a big laugh that we made
kind of like if I was doing like a
catwalk make up on what's her name you
know what I'm talking about super tan
beautiful model she's like Spanish or
maybe resilient but she's stunning and
she's got a super time skin and she's
always got a really nice and matte eye
going on
she's must see all what I named national
oh I could a really annoying I'm gonna
call quickly MSE shade below and I'm
just going to put that over my legs to
stop anything from creasing and to blur
the eyeshadows back never would have
poked through the sky one that's
actually what I'm going to advise like
criticize I'm going to use my pure leg
with mascara
honestly I practiced for so long and I
use it so much that it's getting quite
clunky but I love it because I felt
really really easily
thing do you know what I'm not used that
hourglass foundation that many times
before it but look sweet as a nut
looks fabulous I'm all about feels worth
today
why not and we should because you're a
little baby bottom lashes okay that's
like a better idea what energies are but
it looks so nice and full over there
shows lithium
you know I've never ever great you guys
hardly ever
I'm so excited because I get a very
expert with my friends cause they're
always like honestly the most important
aliens either let's go to London or our
hair stylist or big apartments so
they're always working maybe you guys
are quite large but I think it's going
to be amazing
although it's fiancée nessus probably
one of the only times I would like to
just remit mascara I think I look
swimming so I'm just using my glue
module glue could be in one couldn't
that ought to be lashes and then I
flipped out and open the table flat just
so they can dry because the curl of the
lash usually keeps the band or for
people so it doesn't get all glue in
specky and yoky so good should this must
well so deafening is a little bit of my
cat eye brow gel from child tell Bonita
legendary Rose I'm just going to put
that through because it's a nice dark
room color because I usually wait until
I've done exposure and stuff to do this
step because sometimes predator gets in
my brows and I think some nice and dark
I love that when your time is really can
get we was having a darker blue I'm
really transferred ever know okay now
let me stick this on so I'm just
focusing the last movie at require no
fool okay and now we just really need to
squeeze onto the last leg so I'm going
to use my little toy from Tarte
then I love and I don't really like to
do it are a little bit permanent I've
already made event package to make a
peak and it's got all their news they're
called showstoppers clean stains and
it's a go like lipstick and I tasted it
on my hand
it looks amazing oh man what was those
may be courtesy because I really really
do you to note or can a peachy that
could go either really nice really bad
really bad okay I'm gonna try whoa whoa
smells nice not overpay rear end I'm not
sure it with color though okay I'm going
to mix the colors and I'm not gonna let
later yeah I like the peach colors there
I don't know how I feel about nice Jack
can you come here in let me know what
my heart set this place is nice and lit
doing how it kind yeah but it's a nice
handle alone

ministry again but he actually did my

little bit but I'm happy Baker I'm using

good thing I'm just going over the

I love the tube I think it's really chic
okay like a peach and in last step I'm
going to use a little bit of my tart
fake a weak liners which goes in the
water line and it is really brightens

Fort Worth or things like that so I was
back in two minutes okay basically what
we do and we'll show you how to shine
this up and obviously I've got my tan on
