I am showing you guys how to do this
entire look it is really really really
really really easy
five-minute makeup look it pretty much
has no makeup in it at all
it's just all the stuff that's in this
tiny little bag it is the makeup that I
go to when I have to run errands ever
need to go shopping if I need to go to
the gym if I wanna go anywhere but don't
have time for a filthy some makeup so I
can do this look if I'm sitting down and
I'm just doing it I can do it in five
minutes no problem at all i dented my
car today
like it's the easiest thing ever it's
minimal products I don't tend to rear
makeup at all to the gym but I can go at
the gym with this much on it and feel
comfortable and don't feel like it's bad
for my skin it's a great look for the
gym
if you feel like you need a little bit
of something to feel good about your
sales and feel confident there's makeup
like as perfect if you don't really tend
to very much makeup during the day if
you need just a little bit of something
something for work or school or college
or whatever it's really really easy to
do it is super quick and if you like to
see how to create this look and please
stay tuned okay so it's very quarter to
8:00 in the p.m. and I've had a field
day I actually did this makeup look
today I took it off just so I can show
you guys I am going to personal training
tonight and this makeup look I just
think is perfect for going to the gym if
you need a little bit of help obviously
you can see that I've still got this we
breakout on my head that just won't go
away a bit of redness a little bit of
hyper pigmentation from blemishes
learned that from a skin doctor Caroline
thanks very much but other than that the
other things that I do just enhance
certain features but it's still really
really natural and it isn't that many
products because I know that quite a lot
the time my makeup tutorials have tons
of products and them so this is truly a
five-minute face the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to address
my blemishes and I'm just going to kind
of even out my skin tone a little bit so
the way that I do that is I take my tart
shape tape I know that this is a really
full-coverage concealer but I'm going is
just the tiniest we are made or in the
blemishes and then just I'm just filming
yes the first thing I'm going to do is
address the blemishes when you're doing
this can make up look you do want to
consider that matches your skin tone
this is the shade medium it doesn't
match my skin tone mostly so I'm just
gonna literally put a dot on each spot
it's already look at that much better a
Chen and then out see here that's what I
would say the really dark spots I need
to cover are and then what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna take my sponge this is
the fancy Beauty sponge and I love it
because it's got a really really small
top so what I can do is go around and
blend that concealer note but more
precisely if you're using the big fat
butt of the blends and that's when you
start just blend in the concealer way so
I'm just going around the Blair mesh and
blending out the sides and then the
forehead this is where the worst blemish
was so I'm just being extra careful not
to completely blend away the coverage
I've just blended it a little bit weird
so I need to go back on top and just
choose the taenia mode and I've just
packed up Emma's my fingers first to
make sure the blemish is totally covered
I'm quite happy with that the next
product I'm gonna take as the glossy a
concealer this is the stretch concealer
in the shade medium again I really like
this stuff it just looks like skin it
doesn't have crazy coverage or anything
like that but I like to go in with the
round end of the plans I and then I'm
just gonna take some of this redness out
my skin just in a center you can go
under your eyes a little bit and the
next thing is because this find this M
makeup looks really fresh you can kind
of touch your face during the deep
drop-man your clacking a boat over there
and then I'm just going on my nose a
little bit and then on my forehead
the concealer I'm just gonna put a light
layer of this around that may not look
like much but that is actually how much
I would conceal I feel way more
comfortable and confident because my
main blemishes are gone and that's it
normally cut makeup next I'm going to do
is take the glossy 8 cloud paint and the
shade dusk you'll notice I use a lot of
glossy products in this tutorial it's
probably one of the only things I would
use these products I really do like them
but they are so good for this fresh no
makeup makeup look is totally what the
company can it goes with so it makes
sense but I've got a little bit of that
in the back of my hand I'm gonna take
the Beauty Blender or the fancy blender
thing and I'm just gonna Pat that on my
cheeks and that's for me it's like a
really nice dusty pink color obviously
but they act like a sleep contour and a
slight bronze it makes my skin look way
better but just funny because in real
life like in my usual makeup
I don't really bring that much butcher
but this stuff I was really excited the
first time I used it I just thought I
looked way healthier and actually liked
it now you may notice my skin looks
super shiny
I personally quite like that but I
always carry around my fancy invisible a
powder the embezzlement Universal proto
and what you can do is just take a
little bit of that with your blotter and
you can mattify
who you want smack fight you don't have
to be wearing Lords of makeup to mattify
looking a little bit less shiny never
would have put the shine back into my
skin so this is the glossy heel school
this is the color chorus and it's the do
a fake highlight so I'll actually just
rub that into my cheeks and then use my
fingers just to blend that out you can
just see that I think I look so healthy
I didn't say I'm saying above my brow
because I much prefer a glossy skin -
you might ask and I just think matte
skin on me looks quite dry and I don't
have a lot of makeup on I'm gonna use
this aid because if you look at it
you've got your highlight and render
sides and then you've got your kind of
bomb in the middle so I'm gonna use the
side of it just on my nose and Cupid's
bow
and you can actually go so far as to use
a little bit on your legs if you're one
and just a little bit of shine I like
kind of sealant the next product is
glossy again this is the glossy boy
bright I flip in love this it makes a
huge difference in the way my brows look
I'm just seeing this spot and I do not
like the way it's looking you know I'm
gonna do it I'm gonna go on top of that
blemish with the glossy concealer
because I just think it looks really dry
I almost like it took a little bit
oilier because that just looked horrible
there we go perfect so now I'm going to
want my feet glossy boy pride and this
is the sheet Bren and I'm just gonna go
through my brows a fair few times and
what this stuff does is it makes your
brows look thicker and fuller and a bit
not longer but it just it feels like it
adds a little bit of fibers to it keeps
your brows locked in place for sure like
I got a compliment on my adversity
actually someone said that they were
looking really good and I say that I
just had this on really really good
really good if you've got naturally late
here's this little quote them and make
them nice and dark
if you've got later bro hairs in your
hair color things like that but I just
realized it because it gives my brows I
really nice bushy effect rushed up
brushed up effect today I went for a bit
of a facial type thing it wasn't like my
face it was my neck
it was like a nick Caitlin treatment if
you watch my vlogs you'll know what I'm
talking about so I actually did this
whole routine in the car and it's really
really easy to do in the car which is
funny because I think most of the makeup
I do is impossible to do the car so
crazy so yet then a whole face in the
car next thing as this GABA this is the
gifted mascara from Tarte
I've been reading about this for the
last few weeks I absolutely love it it's
my favorite mascara at the moment and I
just think it's beautiful I think it
gives really nice length it doesn't come
off my face I can workout in it it
doesn't fall down my face it's the only
mascara that doesn't leave some kind of
residue or crumble they my face during
the day so I'm just gonna put this onto
my top lashes and I take a fair bet I'm
building it right up I usually wear
eyelashes every single day
so this for me as a great mascara that
goes really nice dark darkness and make
sure lashes really nice and black nice
and thick and long and curly and it
holds all day it's just like the perfect
mascara and I actually have noticed I'm
getting a few comments from yous guys
see in these picked up and you
absolutely love it too which is great
and you know what I actually don't do
bot mascara and that's look I think it
makes it look much fresher just having a
talk with scattered a and what you can
do if you want if go back and forward
and really build them up even though
this is our obviously it's supernatural
no makeup makeup look I do not mean have
a nice full Moscato and feeling a little
bit a little bit fresher the next X
probably my favorite stay in this whole
can a little routine this is the urban
decay 24/7 glide-on lip pencil this is
the shade Naked 2 which is a really
beautiful brown in it and what I do as I
laid my lips like usual and fell the lip
pen a little bit with the lip liner and
it gives a really nice plump look to the
lips but the door looks super overdrawn
or stupid couldn't set in we don't have
any other makeup on so I'm just gonna do
my lips now
what the hell where's that come from our
Jesus
oo-ee okay and then what you can do to
meet the blood a little bit less Matt
it's get your speck high later way
better looking a bit darn I'm just gonna
put a little bit extra concealer under
my eyes I feel way better so the last
last thing I'm gonna do is and this is
totally optional depends what kind of
finish you like I would say from me
obviously I've got super glossy
highlighted cheeks which is great but I
like more of a kind of radiance and my
skin so I'm going to pull up on the
attached jus skin mist and this is just
a cute little travel size one and that
for me is a finish they look cool
finished the look all finished the vibe
too late for me to be filming so all
that stuff I've got my little keels bag
that I love you can get these and so
gift sets and stuff like that and I love
it because everything that I've used I
can really easily set a tiny little
makeup bag and the concealers are
totally optional obviously I've got one
for blemishes and one for general skin
just to even myself oh yes you've got
really good skin and you don't really
need to cover blemishes you do not need
a full coverage concealer at all just
something to smooth out your skin can
even though the finish a little bit more
I can take full coverage concealer note
just in case I have something going on
you know and that's not even the bag so
I've got my little sponge always have my
little sponge it's really easy but that
is everything super small and then I
usually just keep my pair of human in
there and then there's also another
product if you feel like you can
maintain this routine I talk about this
quite a lot it's the new talent torn
tanning coconut water and what I do with
this is just I just spray it on you can
spray it on top and makeup underneath
your makeup whatever and it gives you a
really nice subtle
tan to face so if you use it day and
night for a week you will be glowing by
the end of it and I mean like your your
face will be tanned but it's like
untraceable you can't see what it starts
and stops it looks really really natural
doesn't really stank if
Tanith like that so I usually put that
on I've been quite bad lately bad at my
routines but yeah that's me oh they sent
a bag
we took my hero cuz I've got it buddy
and it's looking good so you guys that
as my no makeup makeup look in five
minutes good for the gym good for every
day if you don't like weird makeup
during the day but went a little better
makeup during the day I really hope you
like that I understand that the last few
tutorials have been on the more natural
side they're not worried I'm just saving
up my glum juices for some super faces
celebration makeup looks I promise hello
makeup real makeup I hope you guys like
this tutorial and other than that I will
