bad pizza here and they know we're on
our way right
Beauty which is our band which I really
like for anyway I use their stuff anyway
but we have our lip love here and kiss
me
wouldn't it make your lipstick so
fingers crossed rescue salutely what a
surprise so I am me hang my own lipstick
and we're going to do religion needs to
written down my name they kind of color
that under toys at undertone told ya
hello family that were looking nowhere
and then it we'd written down a rebel
for one that's nice and light and then
one that saying a little bit deeper so
I'm very excited a key tale for me
kate is helping me create my own
lipstick or that looks like it that
looks like the one
it's so cool so basically you pack your
finish and we're going from Matt which
is no it's not dry at all it's like
super super panicky me but long-lasting
and then we pick our colors
one two black color that I like I'm
think I'm right and seeing if we pick a
flavor yes so you did on a winner and
it's this one right here is so nice I
will show you later when I'm getting a Z
and then now we're going to try a
slightly deeper knit it was the most
popular color that you think they make
Newton ribs I can see that I can see
that happening so cool so I just tried
as well as we were too warm so we've
made it a little bit cooler color and
I'm going to try that one on there and
it we're just going to go through
something like supernatural for a
daytime
so this is the one we just try it on for
fun obviously but sex shades of
beautiful nudes and you know what
they're also so nice but the ones of our
favorite where this one right here which
is super brony what would you call guys
you have to show you back laying kind of
till dnews a light talk renewed and then
this one here which is but is it this
one yet yeah this one here which is a
wee bit deeper but I'm there pulls just
one eye I'm going to wear everything I'm
going to wear this one tonight
cool so these are the smiles that you
can pack to have in your lipstick you
can either have just one by itself or
you can mix a couple together though
thanks I already have enough of them I
like Eddie what the goings do is the
rate zone in the formula and then that's
how you make it so you won't be able to
buy this online if I'm ever reading it
and you guys are like wow what a
beautiful lipstick but if I gave you my
secret formula you can come to bite lip
blab and you can actually give them the
formula and they'll make it for you and
it's going to be cold Jimmy and the
little tubes you get aren't exclusive
just to the lip flap so they have these
really cute little kiss marks all over
them oh I'm so weak so so this is
lipstick female toads and then what we
do they look at an elbow we're gonna
mail them and it makes really norway's
reading hi Lisa so put them in the
microwave it's got all the components
it's got their teeth just
the Mac and then the Pegman as well and
then am I right in thinking the bytes
lipsticks are all food grade nearly uni
them okay right I'm going to do the
schematic here not do this to taste
don't judge right you guys know that
I've tasted a few eyeshadows in my time
kind of sweet
there's my little bag and my lipsticks
it'll get made and finished and I'm
going to take away my car that's got my
formula in it as well the secret recipe
and it's just like a cooling plate
negative 13 degrees Celsius kids you're
seeing that if you know anyone that's
coming to New York they actually sell
gift cards so I actually said I was like
this would be such a nice gift to give
somebody to come and make their own much
yeah
