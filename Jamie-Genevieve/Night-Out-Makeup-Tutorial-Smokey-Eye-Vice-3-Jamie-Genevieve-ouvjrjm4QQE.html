season 8 would be the winner uh-huh
obscenely backlashes it's obviously
that's why I would do our foundation
life huh anywhere for something I
why are you doing Jesus
hi guys welcome back to my channel I am
wishing that we were more glamorous than
last tutorial because I said I look
really similar to this and I don't want
to get out and laws of you requested I
do this tutorial so thank you very much
for suggesting such things because it
means I don't have to think and it means
if it falls on its thumb it's your fault
it's not my fault but I really won't be
like Kat totally smoky smoky eyes
obnoxiously large eyelashes midlet
obviously ends yeah perfect look for
gore no I would say for me it's a
perfect look for going to work and lush
a nice natural cosmetics shop so join me
in next week and I'm going to be going
through my new skincare routine and
we're going to have a look at that
magnet win again because I've got some
new brush heads and I'm using them but I
wasn't using it and if you watch this
tutorial you'll see I've got about a
sportin so karma I would say thank you
very much for watching guys and I will
be back next week and we'll talk skin
alright so starting off as usual with
brows I'm using thunder blow kick by
Elham Aska and I'm mixing it with a
little bit of water just so I can sketch
out my brow because I shaved it ends in
my brows off it's a wee bit harder to
get the shape I have a pro tutorial that
I'll link just now but all I'm doing is
creating a shape with a break using it
quite heavy and then
furthering the product through the front
of the brow to make it a wee bit more
natural at the front pushing out the
shape making sure I've got the Masons
symmetrical and nice and dark as well
then I go in with my Kevin a corn SX or
four skin enhancer and I use that right
round my brows with an l a-- mascot
angled brush just to define the brow and
clean up any mess dragging down the
concealer onto the lids before a buffer
oh this is going to aid with blending of
eyeshadow Leto spot going on with Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot all over the lid
and underneath the eye as well that's
going to be a great base for eyeshadow
going on with the Urban Decay vice 3
palette shadow and downfall first and
using that under the eye and the socket
line as well and then going on with the
same brush I'm going on with undone
which is slightly later just to blend
that out I'm using my Ziva fluffy brush
just called a blending brush the
concealer as helping blend that out I
want it nice and diffused then I'm going
in with revolver which is the darkest
color and vice co-pilot and that is
going to be my black so I'm paying in
the fill or LEDs guenon with Sophie
pencil by Illamasqua which is a black
kohl pencil color in the water line and
then going in with the black eye shadow
and the Weaver pencil brush just to
smoke that out there's a Weaver crease
brush is going to help me blend the
black into the transition color and
buffalo underneath as well
this I as a very smoky eye so do
whatever go into bold and then going
back in with my fluffier brush just to
blend out any edges
small circular movements or help us then
a maze court of mascara this is
Illamasqua I'm a squatter and I added a
little bit of highlight with the color
Bobby dazzle which is the lightest
colored in that pilot go to the skin now
I'm using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer all over the face and ello ask
ask em B's SB 8.5 using an RC cosmetics
buffing brush I'm just buffing the
foundation right into my skin on top of
the primer and I've just made the whole
process up for you because I'm sure you
know how to do this go right up
underneath my eye I don't really use
concealer under my eyes when I use this
foundation because it's got such good
coverage and then using my Beauty
Blender and mac fix+ spray in the Beauty
Blender and then going all over my
foundation just to give it that flawless
look this is a new thing that I've
started doing and I absolutely love it
my foundation seems to last a lot longer
when I do do this on top of just
applying it with a brush then going on
with a concealer I use drove my eyebrows
but just left over at the back of my
hand I highlight my cheekbones and down
the center of my nose and my cupids ball
and then I go in with a small button
brush just under the eyes to smooth the
foundation into the eye makeup just a
loose no lines or messing bits of
foundation
this is max can finish dark turn and
with this Weaver contour brush and I'm
just going to use this to contour today
so I go down my cheekbones and blend
upwards towards my eye I suppose a
little bit on the forehead a little bit
underneath the chin as well just to
blend the foundation going back in with
my foundation brush I sharpen up the
contour underneath then Mac soft and
gentle highlight start with a little bit
effects plus on my contour brush I apply
a generous amount of highlight because I
like looking a little bit like a disco
ball cheekbones down the nose a little
bit on the Cupid's ball and I like to
put a little bit on my jawline as well
just to make my face less petite alt
Lake this is big blusher by Illamasqua
out my new absolute favorite really nice
deep prank and I'm using that blusher at
just in-between the contour and the
highlight it helps get a really nice
transition between the two LM asking
those pays out just to say all my
foundation and makeup and the center of
my face
I'll leave their outsides in my face
because I like the jury look and for the
lips I'm using Ella mask up T's lipstick
that perfect nude going all over my lips
with that first of all and then I go in
with pencil by Illamasqua and this one's
called honor I'm going to speed this
whole process up for you but I'm
basically showing you exactly how i line
my lips when I do a nude lip so this
pencil is actually a really really dark
brown with a slight purple undertone to
it but I really like it for a nude lip
especially when it's mixed with the nude
lipstick it doesn't look too dark at all
so I've gone right around the perimeter
of my lip and I'm just defining my
Cupid's bow that a little bit more
and then I go in with my angle brush and
a little bit concealer for my eyebrows
just to sharpen up the Lola a the lower
lip last gens with a pair of lush lashes
from Illamasqua the most dramatic
eyelashes you've ever seen in your
entire life and I've made sure the glue
is nice and tacky and I'm just putting
them on with tweezers for precision and
that is the finished look I hope you
guys liked it this is me doing my usual
trying to pause thing yes succeeding and
I will see you guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
