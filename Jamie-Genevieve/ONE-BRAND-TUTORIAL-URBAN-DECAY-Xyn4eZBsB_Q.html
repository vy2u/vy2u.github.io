today I am going to be doing a one brand
tutorial I'm going to be using urban
decay from my entire face so I hope you
guys really like it
the reason that I'm creating this video
is because I am excited tonight that I
am going to be teaching makeup master
classes at the girls dear Shore in
Glasgow so the shores are on the 2nd 3rd

what I'm going to do is I'm going to
link ghettos do website down below where
you can get book your tickets there's
going to be freebies there's going to be
makeup and then I'm doing a
meet-and-greet at the end of it as well
so I can't wait to meet you guys
I'm really excited to bring you this
makeup look a is about a throwback to
the grungy yourself that I used to be
and yeah I'm so excited to say that
Urban Decay are going to be sponsoring
my theatre your hairdo right I've got a
shifter so the the Arkana looking after
those and there I'm going to be used in
urban turkey products to create the look
so this is my one brow tutorial I hope
you like it without further to do it
let's get into this filthy toriel first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do
it my eyebrows not liar put it in my
eyes first I'm going to use as the Urban
Decay Eden creamer this is Sophie mess I
would say it's one of the most famous I
pray Mary's out there when I first
started in makeup everybody used it and
I have used that use use on clients a
lot but in I'm not used in ages so I'm
excited to see who I thank so I'm just
using my finger to blend that and I'm
just bringing that right up to my brow
and then to the side I'm not going to
put it underneath my eye because I'm
going to do something different there
I'll just give you a nice blank canvas
how I'm going to use as my ultimate
basics palette I have done a video on
this palette before but I use these
colors so today I'm gonna use these
colors I'm going to start off and I'm
going to pack this color on all over the
lid this one's called nudie and then
we're going to go end with commando
intended just to start building up like
freeze I'm just using a fluffy brush all
over it just to pack that color on make
sure it's nice and matte you know the
drill
the script or so after that it's on and
everything's mattified I'm going to go
in with the shake command when tempted
that I showed you before and I'm going
to start building up that crease color
so this is actually quite cool toned for
me you let me go just changing it up
every day you know so I'm just building
that up in the crease bit by bit
because they're letters nice and
mattified everything is just going on
ship pretty easy everything's blending
newly well as well I'm just still
building up those colors commando
attempted in the crease I'm really
loving the show the shadows are applying
if this piece I'm not used in so long
but it is really great for coming across
really pigmented considering they look
so can appeal and the palette is coming
across really really well now I'm going
to win with a sheet and stain which is
just here it's the second dark who's
kind of perfectly color and then we're
going to just go in with a little bit of
this to start darkening up in the crease
so going to distinct first this is I've
even more lightly key so that's when
they kind of purple tones should start
showing through it's not like a super
bright purple it's more like a kind of
movie allelic weird one with tapered
blending brush it from Urban Decay this
is part of their new brush strange and
when it women she lethal which is the
darkest part felt and I'm going to start
a sketch and I at the crease just using
my fluffy brush just to blend that
darker color keeping it nice and high in
the inner corner that gain that personal
preference don't need to do that then
we'll go in with a mix of the two
darkest shades on my fluffy brush and
just use that to build up some depth
I'm going to go end it with my Urban
Decay 24/7 waterline pencil and the
shade real pretty much a really really
dark dark brown I'm going to go straight
in the waterline and then I'm going to
drag that underneath my eye as well
this was my favorite trick to do on
clients to get a smoky eye that lasts
all night so no one will you win it with
my Sigma pencil brush the e30 and the
darkest color in the palette the purple
and I'm going to smoke that pencil out
though and now I'm going to go back in
with my Urban Decay tapered blending
brush and they can ally lick your shade
and I'm going to buff that out
don't worry too much about making a mess
because we have not done a foundation to
do so the reason that I've started with
my eyes first is because I know that's
what I wanted all the drama to be so by
starting with my eyes it may mean that I
go in a little bit lately with my brows
or a little bit can I always overdrawn
with my lips or filler with my eyebrows
so it just keeps all the focus right on
my eyes so I'm just using my big fluffy
brush just to diffuse these edges I'm
not too worried all because I've still
not going in with my foundation yeah
we're just going to tell you everything
up so I'm going to go straight into the
light now I'm going to swap palettes and
I'm going to go in with my Vince palette
and just to change up the colors I'm
actually going to go in with the shade
element which is a computer full orangie
pen key dual chrome glitter so we're
going to use that next and I'm actually
going to use my finger
I love these eyeshadows so much I think
the texture is beautiful the payoff is
great
and even though we might not use it
every day it's still nice to have it
just to add a little pop of color to
your eye makeup love it
I'm just going to go in with my little
Smith flat brush because of my nails I
can't really get right into then a
coroner who feels me with those nil
probes just for a kind of pop of color
on the lid to make that a little bit
more bold I'm going to go in with
Midnight Cowboy glitter liner by Urban
Decay as well and I'm just going to add
that on the lid
alright a blogger I think it's so nice
and that is as a pulp a connect glitter
to the grungy look we've create and just
to break up underneath a little bit I'm
going to put a tiny little bit just
under my eye almost like a kind of
glitter spotlight underneath next thing
we're going to do is apply some mascara
I'm going to use perversion by Urban
Decay this is a really great mascara you
can use it with or without the trailer
that comes with it but because we're
using larger city I don't need them to
be too thick by themselves whelming for
my lashes to dry I'm going to quickly do
my eyebrows I'm not going to do too much
them today just a little bit of this
brow gel as as rotamer and medium brown
and then just to fill in any kind of
sparse areas I'm going to use the brave
beater pencil initiated neutral Brown
and then I'm just going to use the
pencil end just to fill in any kind of
gaps and I like to just make the arch
slightly higher so I'm focusing most of
the products just through the end of the
braid
once I'm done with that I'm going to pop
these lashes on
so they're looking super dark super
trendy just for i it was one thing I
always feel with Urban Decay these lips
are so easy to create with the products
they're just really high-performance
products I love them first thing I'm
going to do for my skin is hydrating I'm
going to use my clothes pin which I have
been loving underneath my eye foundation
next thing we're going to do is prime so
I'm going to use the brightening and
tightening complexion primer portion man
that's hard to see so I'm just going to
get decent monetha at the back of my
hand
and I have used this before I used it
when I was in California or in Turkey
and I totally forgot I had it but I
loved it my foundation did not come off
and it's really fab underneath that all
night or foundation which is what we're
going to use now we're going to do is
I'm going to take my all NATO Foundation
and the shade for this foundation does
oxidize so it looks a little bit late
for me to begin with but as soon as it
starts to oxidize that looks great
so I'm going to apply that with my
Beauty Blender and just get a nice even
coverage this foundation is super high
population you do not need that much
this looks a wee but yellow meat without
Spain see becuase I have redness in my
skin I like to use a more Gael beef
foundation just to make sure that it's
all covered up now for under eyes I'm
going to use the light warm concealer
The Naked skin concealer and I'm just
going to highlight right under my eyes
this has been our old fave of mine for a
long time I used some clients when I
worked as a freelance artists and I just
loved it it looks beautiful
and pretty much everyone's skin I think
the applicators ship very easy to use as
well just love it and then just using my
Beauty Blender right up underneath eyes
not too worried to break my eye makeup
because when you use a brush just to
blend all that make sure it's a nice
seamless finish I'm just using my Smith
on one side brush just
to smooth all that I'm going to use my
be sex play I have used this for years I
get my face a good spree with that and
then make sure that all that moisture is
going right into my skin I'm going to
bronze up with the beach bronzer and
bronze and we're just going to add some
dates to fit the skin I'm just using my
morphe m-104 brush just go ahead and the
cheeks under the chin and then I'm going
to put a little touch just on my
forehead as well I'm going to win with a
little smaller brush just to get those
quantity tails a little bit stronger now
I'm going to add my highlight I'm going
to use the Naked illuminating baked
highlight or make it a little bit
stronger I'm going to explain my B
sex-free on my brush pick up that
product so it's a very gonna wet looking
highlight which I really like and then I
do not like to this Pat Lewis died a
little bit I'm gonna pop a little bit of
this bronzer just around my nose to
create that kind of contoured look it's
not as strong as that it's a lot more
readable but it just adds a little bit
of Sun and it kind of breaks up the face
a little bit now that my foundations on
my skin is finished I'm going to go back
in with my baby toe and just neaten up
these brows a little bit just focusing
it all on the tail again
and I'm just going to elongate the braid
just slightly and then just to add a
little bit more thickness and when you
use the bro Timur just through these
frontiers again just make them a little
bit darker finally we are on to lips I'm
going to be using the broken Urban Decay
24/7 pencil lip liner and then I'm
actually use a high color lip gloss this
is the shade midnight cocoa
only the reason I've used a lip gloss
have to cause obviously it's wintertime
our lips are starting to get low but
we're dry a little bit more crack lip
glosses are much more hydrating and they
just feel super comfortable my lips and
then I'm just going to use my little
brow pencil filling my vehicle ah sorry
guys that is the finished look I hope
you like that I really enjoyed in the
challenge of doing a filmy cup just
using one brand as you guys know I
usually paint between lots of different
brands but it visually fun just to use
one I hope you liked the look that it
really reminds me of like old school
Jimmy the Jimmy that worked at Elm asked
that the super dramatic makeup every day
the same it was a nice little bag from
me but I really I really love the look I
am so excited about teaching these
classes it goes do it so I hope to see
you guys there let me know down below if
you're going to be there so I can keep
an eye out and I'll see you in the next
