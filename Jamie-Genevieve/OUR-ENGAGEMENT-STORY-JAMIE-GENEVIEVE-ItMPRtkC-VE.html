or seven weeks 15th of July so that and
one two three four five five and a half
weeks ago long time that it feels like
forever

14th of July 2017 Jack asked me to be
his wife and basically we obviously we
do weekly vlogs but we did not film or
you did not film the proposal just us
yeah I went to the key to play that role
in happening consider on the fact is
were impossible for me to set up as well
your very self that we had planned then
things like that I'd not you know can't
believe that you - it was supposed to be
an public area sort attained 1508 I can
what I record and stuff like that with a
be impossible so basically in the vlog
that week the week that we got engaged
we said that we would sit down and tell
you guys what happened so here it is I
would start the story as we got this
last minute open daily Jack was quite
stressed though and we were driving
through it to see my family the day we
got the news and he made me drive is
like you can drive and I do love driving
but you always drive he always liked
driving June so when I was driving Jack
was on his phone the whole time and I
was like and honestly six months we'd
know maybe like three months leading up
to that point I had caught and Dawn to
the fact that Jack was acting quite
weird I was like I can't so same time I
was like what you did yeah if we you
Danny was almost f2p enough on his phone
and stuff and I was just like he's been
into a weird or don't know what was
going on obviously we got to LA and then
the day before we had an event we went
to the event we had fun the next day I
was working early in the morning and
then we chilled by the pool day through
me and then at the end
we were shooting a better look book or
shooting they look quick at this point
Jack said I really want to go to the
Griffith Observatory thank you I was
like yeah it's nice
but I have been like three things before
but I was right and then you said I not

day obviously I nearly I planned it for
that day anyway ever Jimmy was looking
good so I was late right today yeah they
are tonight that'll be the night we got
an a car to go to the Griffith
Observatory if you don't know the leo
Griffiths observatories at the top of
this hill in the Hollywood Hills and
then there's a windy road down the hill
and then at the foot of the hill there's
a place called the peaks theater which
is a really famous theater and it just
so happened there was a huge Shore and
that name is Friday night so our journey
which should have been about 25 minutes
press ENTER and earn half so when we
were in the car going up as hell the Sun
went down yeah so I planned that to be
nice I planned the Tivoli dusk sunset as
the school yeah I've lined up to be like
dusk in the Sun setting over the city
and stuff away this is just get away you
bet dark stars coming out well hey what
get that block top that home yeah it was
really bad no oh it was making me feel
sick because the car was can alert him
forward and self enlargement forward and
stop it and then by the time we go up to
the Griffith Observatory it was dark
it's actually quite cool did you see
this the concert was like yeah yeah that
cause I was like I mean he seemed cool
I was like I'm Nate he's owned be known
that yeah it's actually probably really
love I just take me up we're going to
talk finally it was mugged but today
like it was the best I've ever seen it
everything I've been it's been during
the week and the mornin so it's been
actually really nice and quiet but it
was dark it was actually pretty cold I
had like a little please sit on it I was
absolutely so injured and it was
absolute most of service she's getting
Nadine I was very cranky the biggest
shame of all was I had started getting
tired i was connecte rabbit of kinda
that means maybe by the way
rabbit as a good Scottish for anyone
that wants to know I started getting
really moody I was hungry I was tired
I've been there before so I was going
off for a waste of an ie what wait so
when are you coming back here and even
you'd been before as well like it was
your first time kitchens it was like so
busy as well so we were walking around
and I planned to do it well in the back
end
yeah so nice to get in the back end of
it best if you anywhere you win was just
morbid
maybe so badly and then obviously we had
been shooting that D style
I had my makeup on my hair done and my
movie I felt Lauren and Jack kept on
trying to meet me like take pictures and
hassling I don't want to take anybody at
one point Jack was like oh why don't you
just like like stand at this wall and
like look at the view and I was like so
I was just getting really crabby and
then Jack had his backpack at all times
because the camera was in the backpack
so I just thought you being protective
or in camera yeah add my Leroy with my
hand on that unboxed the whole table
holding the bag just looking for like a
play moment so through a pair of oak
anyway so we spine up and I rode up
there i mmm
I remember you said right if you're
tired and your pennants on the site why
don't we just go home okay so it was so
really really busy
it's even absolutely ages to get a taxi
so we're just sitting and a cold unless
we find there's spell so many people up
there and I remember u-turn I went I
feel really bad because this was my idea
and I don't think it's hard to pay him
and I was like yeah I think I'll go home
so we finally get a new bro the guy that
turns up dead wrong it was a nation off
guy he was he was but he was a lovely
caring guy boy I was there just a man
but it was the car didn't know you know
it wasn't it was like a weed Pujo to sex
tape thing I saw was anything it was
like a wee three-door hatchback
I did have five-door yeah there is that
gonna hatch but it felt like a smoker
and as soon as you sat in it the male
with absolute disgust
and he had always be toys than a yeah it
was less than them to like in heavy
heavy at all music Israel the whole week
woman is just calendar me so basically
the whole legal it is playing this music
which I actually don't mind a new
domains as well we knew we knew mostly
music so yeah whatever but the car was
thinkin he had all his we toys all over
the car like it looks like he left in
his car yeah and they can't run far and
and turn around and saying do you guys
smell sulfur it is tech companies time
yeah and I was like me that literally
Kona if you're just completely alone in
the mood
it was absolute dress then so we finally
got home I was actually like I'm gonna
bid go up to the room and Jimmy started
which stood up in Afghan know before
baby I'm sorry like lexical you're lucky
I'm gonna keep her wiped my feet hmm but
yeah I just started getting to probate
and I next remember Euclid we have eight
would be oh ok picture a v8 from up from
a snapchat and it was like I don't care
about your snapchat I don't know if you
guys seen in the vlog there it was
really nice by Elliott was even better
because well for me or for the situation
no it was really bad because they had
left double doors the open on it I look
in the Hollywood Hills
really making you yeah yeah so Jack say
to me go and stand it opened up with
double doors
another thing I should mention we'd left
the room to therapists and the room so
the whole place
funk of parmesan - it literally it
smelly cheese in the room so as soon as
I walk in I was like thank them joggers
we were available kept a picture so it
opened up the double doors and then they
go and stand and look at the view and
I'll take a picture from a snapchat and
then you had your phone in your hands
and honestly I don't really think that
anything was gonna happen until that
take and when it was making me like
pause and I was looking at the view and
then you said oh that's a nice one and
then I remember found another picture
and then directed or that's a nice one
and then I turned around
ears or with me I know that's right I
honestly do not feel weird as
identifying any fan or vet at all but
when I was found and poured into that
picture and that moment I thought about
turning around to look at the reflection
in the door to see what you were doing I
was like he's been sneaky he's been
sneaking so that's what happened
Jax had some lovely things he asked me
to marry on to funny things when I turn
around the ring box of course jack is
adamant that that of course made to
happen
he thinks the immediate you think you
may need to keep the bottle that was my
excuse because my hands really shaken
I've never seen Jack nervous before but
your hands were shaking on the ball
playing it I'm going to fast reset we
had a moment we had sex you said some
nice things you asked me and then I said
yeah straight we then as you started
crying how do we cry but it was a
promise sure it was a pretty silent like
tear it was like an old movie I promise
but neither try I don't think original
but I think it was because I turned
around in the first thing Jack said boys
I really tried I really really tried and
I was like I think I felt so bad because
I know that I had been a better name
here that night I just been difficult
and I was tired and when I get car back
normally I'm like everything was going
so well up until the fun when we had the
bottom of the hill and I just - so be
nervous there yeah it took so long to go
in the car the car is a hard yeah the
Sun was like setting over that hill
there's so many people I don't there's
too many people to make it nice day huh
too many yeah I know yeah we had our
moment and then the first thing I asked
you was who knew and my mum and dad had
knowing that sends Johnny Lee and my
pink had I had known since October
before it's nice it was like not that
many people knew a few of my friends had
an inkling it was kind of annoying by
the way every time I was going somewhere
they were like maybe it
my favorite thing about the whole story
and how it happened is your
thoughtfulness faith at all and it's the
reason the Euro stray from offender 20
early basically my rang
it's from my favorite jeweler in New
York and it wasn't easy to get it was it
no no because I had to I had to get a
plan together and port it to the UK so
what happened did you email them and see
here when I rang yeah sure I got been in
touch with Aegean obviously I thought
but then things like that and I've had
it you'd paid for that okay
I'd put the ship into the UK because I
said yeah there was no we ever get into
New York without you without you
realizing so I thought that the UK but
then obviously we had the alien V
through so I was like Shep man I'm going
to be flying across to the America the
Lang is going to big dispatch to the UAE
you're gonna cross ships in the night so
I think and it delivered to his mum and
dad's house and they were on holiday at
the time yeah so the ring would be
getting delivered turn empty house and
obviously is absolute terrifying idea of
getting engagement ring shipped you
seeing that boy he dead was much bigger
house for the day walking through to
your aunt's I wish thing on her the
jello that's why I was I know that I act
like a weirdo it's like you can drive
any sad day because I had to try and
rearrange the delivery to get it shut
totally and I managed to do it by one
day he got in touch with a jeweler and
said have you shipped it to the UK and
the guy was like no what we're doing it
tomorrow and don't like dude don't do
the head anything I call them so course
so your range takes to get it shipped
from New York to LA yeah the day after
we go to LA and I've really quickly yeah
Jack woke me up and was like I'm gonna
go and check her a box and gem and don't
Tony Lee and I was like okay cool have
fun did not see oh I'll come with you
earlier in the class he fed back up but
then he showed me show me pictures on
this borneo so this is the gem I'm going
to and I was like okay
like a fake sentence where needle
picture other way joins jr. playing box
and it was the first one I could find
with a Fiat on their connections it
showed me this picture of this box and
rang and was like this is where I'm
going I was like okay have fun
so you could and the more and then I'm
just getting ready and stuff
it came woman he was like cost $30 in an
uber together there Oh a all that to
name your people know it's like caustic
it's honest to rent the clothes that's
like oh but more than you've had don't

warehouse Phillip ourselves and was like
he I'm picking up a packet and you gave
a number and it was been like 20 seconds
new place evil crazy so I think you were
really bold I just kind of leave it like
it was just sitting there and also
exactly show it to you PS yeah that's
all I gotta say is that the more than
one and only thing that you guys have
probably done it right and I've been
that it was just like a really lovely
trying yeah so that is the story that's
how I almost ruined that by being a
grumpy bear Oh watch out for the Bears
but oh wait they I was shocked I am
happy I suggest it away I didn't really
know but you were acting weird
yeah I was nervous you were nervous but

little story on how we got engaged I
love it I love hearing her yeah me too
it's a good story when you think of all
the things that went wrong and I coulda

the best and that gave us a good story
yeah I could have been more pure shape

to so many factors oh and then I had to
show you that is my ring for anyone I
