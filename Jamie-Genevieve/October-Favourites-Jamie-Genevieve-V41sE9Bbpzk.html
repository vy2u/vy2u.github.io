your drink especially the blackest
coffee
known to man hi guys welcome back to my
channel
deaf sweet Ruben do another fave those
and I've been working very very hard and
by that I mean I've been vital to those
things to try not so I have a very 8
favorite things from this month I am so
excited so let's just jump right and I
wish me my first theme think super
affordable and amazing which is good
because sometimes things I pick a wee
bit expensive first thing as the new ill
daughter false lashes NH 1 6 7 there are
the most beautiful wispy lashes so
they've got spaces so they're spaced out
and when they're on the eye they look
incredible they say like all at the time
I'll link a little to an hour down the
law but these are the only brand of
lashes I'm using that woman I just love
them to boats they are really really
complementing on pretty much every eye
shape you can trim them if you need but
I find that I don't have to turn these
half as much as other states take the
lashes that I've been doing so big
humongous fan of them but a little bit
favor a little bit favor but I just love
Tibet's and you can actually get quite a
few years out of thumb even though
they've got an invisible band I think I
usually get about three or four uses
number two is a Mac product this is one
of the nude matte powder blush shows and
it's called Swiss chocolate and this was
only made to be a limited edition but I
asked the gala landmark what was the
deal because I love it so much and she
said that because that they're so good
and they're they're so colorful like a
pigment really really good and they're
going to keep them so that's actually
what I've been using as a contour color
underneath her bronzer so this is like
my deeper contour color I am so
highlighted to be loving
the dream really really nice Picanto
color but on the eyes especially all my
goodness it's beautiful and I'm a big
huge fan the Pegman is really nice
confirm I like I don't envy those
shadows from my courts tomorrow I don't
think the goods but that is amazing and
it's one of the nicest warm brown tones
I've ever seen in my life
super fabric trust myths and then
obviously you've got back to Mac which
means if you run out of sex if deployed
actually take it back to the lipstick
the reason I'm telling you guys because
no one told me no one told me until
about two years ago in Maine Maine I've
been doing makeup for quite awhile no no
one told me that I could swap sex in
empty Mac product to put a few up stick
do not have any freeletics I thought of
me devastated so yeah no you know
shooting shooting the wealth of
knowledge because I'm a she or I'm a
giver
okay and I got this as praise and
sweetheart I love Tibet is there my
favorite brush by brands for sure and
super affordable which just I can't get
my head round so that's it is the new on
top collection I can't see it cuz I'm
not cool I don't have that actually
they're tall so it's always pop on top
that's what I've been seeing so
basically you get this really cute full
leather bag which comes with your
brushes and them so you get sex brushes
these are mostly all older sales but
you've got one which I die for this is
called the 3 to 2 blue line brush and
it's just like a really really firm
small angle brush and this is what I use
for both concealer to go to my dress to
make them super sharp so you've got your
angle you're brilliant brush your Lux
pencil brush
you've got wine glitter brush you've got
soft if I you know this is just the same
as the Mac 217 brush pretty much but 10
things weren't affordable and last
longer in my opinion and then you've got
your Lux crease brush which is just
super beautiful domed brush so these are
all dirty a peaceful and then you've got
your a little precise shooter so I've
not seen this one before but and I don't
usually it but I think it would be
really good for eyeshadow
Denise that I saw reassured I was like
oh thanks
that's a brush set like I would
genuinely use all the thumb and I do
love a nice makeup bag to go in my
handbag to stop all my stuff roll it
about at the bottom of my bag and making
it don't even make up a little bit this
is the final second product I've ever
used from Stila but this is the sphere
all day waterproof the liquids Eileen oh
this thing is phenomenal if you've got
me on Instagram you'll notice I've been
doing the Lord more can I flick that
looks patented a obviously the but I've
been using this and it is incredible it
is the blackest I know it does have a
bit of a glossy finish so if you're one
a matte Eileen oh maybe not a base but I
would sacrifice this light shine for how
long this lasts did not crease there's
no mail sometimes that eyeliner melts
and here because I've got earlier dies
then do that and it's actually quite
easy to use and like the grand scheme of
things flex a leader is probably the
most difficult part I make up for me
still like no matter how you got to
practice and I do always get the earth
but sometimes I'd have to take like a
way of cleaning it off and taking off
and trying again and stuff like that
persistence is the key how do you need
tiny little little end filt tip so
really like that and you can get a super
nice black line and it's nice you can go
the end I think that's the most
important thing for me is that you can
get the end really really makes me sharp
it does take a little practice if you're
not used to using a feel tip tight bueno
the one thing that I worry about with
kind of felt tip liner like that is that
the ball dry out but my friend Cara
actually uses this all the time and she
swears by it
it was hardly be by it actually and she
says that the last absolutely Jose saw
winning and I'm sure I paid 15 pounds
for this and marks and spin so well I'm
on the subject of March suspense so I
understand it's Halloween and I believe
it air late but because this is my first
Christmas in my flat I'm very excited
about like daily in and just making the
flat until I got a bit of a good ortho
to be honest so when I was in Marcus
Payne sir
except this room is planned and always
one computer to me but if you're
anything like me you like see me Krupp
station these are cool second to what I
hold dear in my heart and then it's like
candles and rooms vacant since they're
like my three top things makeup stay
tuned me it's merely thanks favorite so
I packed up the mandolin clove and
cinnamon room spray you guys it feels
like happiness in here I'm not joking
the filth fire smells like cinnamon
minds are in a chord and it's beautiful
it's thanks to Christmas and what not
all of you made sale because I totally
understand and quite a lot of my family
don't celebrate Christmas but you can't
deny that this meal is everything
everything I absolutely love a store
it's probably quite you like Errol in
the year for me evil crazy with this
stuff but I have a reap diffuser
I have candles and I have a room spray
and I've got Payton coins its million
cinnamon marks his face those Gordon's
meal all the candles and enjoy yourself
as a wealthy next thing is something
that I probably should have tried a long
time ago because I watched the video I
was naked tutorial talked about it and I
was like nah nah I just leave it and
went to boots no way to superdrug picked
up the Navi out man that seems to post
shave balm because I made up a bit of
being a good primer for like slightly
oily skins I'm so sorry it took me so
long
this was half face I'm sure it was a bit
too opponent and UK a hundred mils so
here and you thank you reading the grand
scheme of things I had normal foundation
bottles there emails
this is a hundred and you need the
tiniest little bit and it keeps my
friend is you know and all the Aldi it
smells like man Israel which accurately
yeah I'm absolutely obsessed for those
let's turn it a nice little bit all over
my skin usually do it after I've got my
eye makeup and it's thanks then and it
was pretty matte to the touch and then
appear on my foundation which is pretty
druid to be honest and I'm hoping
powders on top and sure I'll look a
little bit shiny not oily before you see
olive oily it sure look really highly
that Jew look just these all day it
doesn't change doesn't move a foundation
cities all in as well and this is the
best okay second last thing and this is
a bit of a cheat one because I don't
actually use this product by itself it's
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation in 6.58 number one it's too
dark for me and number two I don't make
it by itself so didn't raisin my
favorites no I do know how to my
favorites I have started mixing this
with a white Ella mascot skin base
foundation and it's the best combo I've
ever found of entire life my skin
produces all myself my skeleton cleared
the ball like see and relay and walk
about and enforce must going to just
look so much better I think I absolutely
love it I think I probably like this by
itself and this summer I like seafront
cred one holds enjoy you'll probably get
my real color of this actually I could
probably let's look at a time I mean
like wait a month all of the I will take
this with me and I'll use this by itself
with the Navy or primer because that
will keep it in place but it's just not
enough coverage for me I need more so I
can understand if you have tried to get
base because of me and you don't like it
because it's too here they try those
last but not least you'll have seen this
a few Romans to Graham I have made the
ultimate makeup peak palette
look at this what even is this I am a
women upstairs look at that coming into
one's her you obviously you can I think
you can get away with more colored and
things like that someone's more drape
fresh and natural and move basically I
have packed a handful of permanent
shadows that they've had for a while and
I've got quite a lot of the new Matt
shoots and there's room for the new maps
released this month but I've also got
lords of the permanent lane that we've
already had for ages so basically what I
did was I hand-picked all my favorite
matte shades and I literally don't think
I'll ever need to use another
and my entire life unless I wouldn't
believe deliberate color so this is the
new Z palette that makeup geek and Z
palette designs super cute love home
it's kind of like Goldie it goes a bit a
little bit makes my makeup funny you
look nice so these a I'm going to list
all the shades down below not in order
because that'll take me a million years
but well that's all the shades down
below someone comment and I'm Instagram
saying they should name him they should
make this Anna Anna like an actual
palette and Nina after me I wouldn't say
an alter that because I'm pretty damn
proud of myself this is the most
majestic thing I've ever made in my
entire life don't take that away from me
okay guys that is all my favorites from
October I hope you really really like
them and they're all things that I've
been using almond and that I feel like
they are the best loves and tourettes so
I hope you all have a really nice
Halloween something I totally forgot to
mention in the last that you all is it's
