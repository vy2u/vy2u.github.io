we are just gonna do a makeup I have
people to see places to be so I thought
I would just get up early set down and
sell I didn't know what I was gonna do
with my face when I sat down about me we
quickly figured it out and we end up
having it's a fixation on a Sarah and
women do I want to be and that's who
I've tried to do my makeup around tried
being the key word
if you would like to see how I created
this entire look then please stay tuned
why the bad things happen to good people
Adi ready I'm going to get my nails done
and I've actually watched YouTube for
too long so this is gonna be a quick
sley and I've been thinking of you know
me but under the way though so I've not
been waiting as much makeup so I
actually I want to wear quite a lot of
makeup today I need to cover up this Shh
and I also just want to look and feel
great
so we're gonna do this really quick
quickly the first thing I'm gonna do is
I need to hydrate my skin I am going to
use the glossy a super bounce serum I'm
gonna put that on first I've used this a
few times not too many but I do it late
Kat I have the Saudis wisdom teeth right
now just to say like my face it feels
like it's out here next thing I'm going
to use as the glam and glow volcanic
Matt Gore moisturizer I use this for the
first time last night oh my god
it smells like oh it smells amazing it
smells like orange sherbet and I really
like it the other one I was trying I
think may have also been freaking me out
don't know what's going on but there's
moisturizer that is gorgeous
I did a glam glow mask as well last
night trying to sort my skin it and my
foreheads get in there but then this has
happened I'm amazing it sucked that
feels great Christmas list
guys Christmas lists that mmm actually
the primer I'm going to use today is the
faint a Beauty drool filter matte primer
and it's been a while since I used this
I've actually not used it since the week
where I was trained CNT oh but I
remember I loved it but I think I need a
framework because whatever has happened
with muskan is just just mochi I'm just
rubbing that and I put two pumps on the
back of my hand that was far too much
you only need one pump I'm gonna use the
makeup Forever's thick foundation and
the shade 1 2 3 equals y 3 5 I don't
think I'll ever learn how to say that
yep yes that's a sore one by the way
it's like angry it's an angry spot I
think I need a facial Lords of that
because we need to cover up thanks that
urn I feel better already
I actually really love this foundation
really love it I think it's the
healthiest lookin foundation and we're
going to be adding loads of coverage of
shape tip to do and I'm using my
questionable sponge what are you guys
asked for you can get it at the moment I
think you want to get it from LC
cosmetics but it is really great reusing
shaped leaf or medium spa is a flippin a
map maybe army kept the color all cute
freckle a little more foreheads getting
better though and I'm just gonna go
straight over my eyelids is it exactly
how I get baby but I need to get really
quickly I actually always end up liking
my makeup more when I've rushed it it's
like you always look your base when you
don't have to leave the house and then
when you have to leave the house you
look like the fit so I know my eyes like
I was like teeny I am still waking up
looking much better that spot is crazy
that needs to calm down
right now I'm gonna just skin focus and
make a nice smoky eye I think but I may
try and use different colors I'm just
using my Kat Von D translucent powder
and the shade light love their stuff and
I'm using one of my new smooth brushes
that says the 1 3 3 brush can you hear
my throat I am NOT well I always get it
sick
same year what a mess my life I might
actually just did my nose I want to try
and snatch my nose today as well
I was watching karyn's YouTube and her
nose was so perfect
yeah thanks but I'm just gonna make it
until the Oh cute mole it's gonna be
great I'm going to go ahead and finish
off my skin some when you use my give me
Sun bronzer by Mac and my newest method
one three nine brush these brushes are
so gorgeous another thing that I would
have put on my Christmas list evident
have them because they're just beautiful
and we're gonna really bring the Sun
onto her face because but one degree
outside and I'm absolutely over it and
if I'm talking funny it's because this
wisdom tooth thing is killin me bronzing
off everywhere do you know why I might
try and do my makeup like today I just
followed her on Instagram I recognized
her name but I didn't know it was until
last night Madison beer she is so
beautiful
maybe I'll try and do my makeup like her
so I feel bad though do you know why I
think I think she's so gorgeous I think
she looks a little bit like Megan Fox
and everyone knows that I love making
folks so much things are blowing has
that on her face more hmm that's a bit
of an idea if you guys want me to do any
makeups inspired by celebrities let me
know that could be quite cool there's a
few people I think her absolutely
beautiful that I could probably try and
make myself look like this as the glossy
a cloud paint and the shade dusk I have
been using this Lourdes and more
recently because I've not been very well
planned I don't wear that much makeup or
what I don't wear makeup and then I have
to leave the house I'll actually just
use like four or five products just to
make myself look about their eye and the
difference is actually really crazy if
you want me to do a video on that let me
know because it's literally like five
minutes and you just look more awake
less sick and you just look a bit more
like
approachable this I've never done on top
of fragra friend Asia but I'm just gonna
try it that's cute
it looks really shiny
okay I'm gonna zoom the end and we're
gonna do our eyes I think so let's do a
price first I'm gonna use my Urban Decay
brave the earth I want to do my dress a
little bit softer still filled in but
just a little bit softer a bit more
natural than usual I'm just like going
round the brain filling it and
elongating it a little bit and then
making it bit thicker I'm bringing it
down at the front but I'm not going
right to the front of the breaks they
usually bring it what help did Robert
already forgot a premiere and an innate
t-shirt that looks nice
I'm trying to do this Oh natural brave
lake matheson beer think of a face I'm
going to build up my eyebrows with gimme
brow in the shade number three and I'm
just gonna do this
bit by bit and build them up I like
these eyebrows that took me literally
hardly any time at all to do those I am
going to use the who w/e warm of
cessations palette this is another thing
that I would definitely having the
Christmas list I am planning on doing a
video on Christmas gift guides ash you
guys on Twitter by the way who she's in
this color here actually guys on Twitter
of what you would like and I gave you
the optionally four videos and you all
want them all and you know what I salute
you just don't do it don't stand for
part of what you want get it all even if
it means me working my ass off in
December so I've totally my excitement
this is the pure on point eyeliner and
the shade notes or T really tiny point
and we're gonna do is we're gonna make
her eyes look more almond shaped so by
that I mean you were gonna smudge this
do difference it's just like doing a
little cat eye but we're gonna really
smudge it and then to sharpen it you
just push it up I'm just using my motor
to make sure I'm getting these
Somnath even when I go on to the midsole
of the Lashley okay I'm going to go
underneath a little bit as well and I
need to do smoke this out blank canvas
cosmetics e16 brush teeny teeny tiny and
we're gonna go in with this warm shade
here I'm just gonna stamp that along Wow
that Islanders really stay on so you see
how this has got a definite that makes
it look like a Wang we're gonna get rid
of that because I need it to be more
like calm Oh
like a V I think I need to smoke a bit
more I'm gonna go in with the same color
right I think that will work when
difficult lashes on and I'm just using
that little brush with the warm
eyeshadow to kind of stamp on top of
this later and then because the brush is
so small you can use it to really smudge
that one out I'm gonna use this really
nice light transition shade just to get
a little bit of shadow on my eye using a
fluffy brush just to put that in the
crease because it's a light shade you
can pretty much just slap on and I'm
bringing it right out to meet that one
this is all just to create that almond
shaped eye I'm gonna cool under my eye
and I'm actually gonna bring this blue
eyes look smaller than when I started
okay I'm just getting some more shadow
and just elongating this wing a little
bit I think I'm gonna use a shimmer just
a little bit I think that would be nice
I'm gonna use me Rami from the key Daisy
collection on my finger
that's a competitor right I'm gonna find
my lashes so these are the Mykonos
lashes they're super super fluffy but
see if he cut them tightly you can make
them appear sucker
so that's what we're gonna do and then
we're just gonna over a draw our lips to
have heal so I'm gonna cut City of those
off you can see it's thicker on the
outside than it is and then sites that
in say it's actually quite short this is
how teeny I've cut these they're almost
like half lashes but that way they're
just going to set and they're really
like outsides of my eye
okay I'm going to put on tons of mascara
and that says the gifted mascara from
Tarte I absolutely love it
and see because I cut so small that
actually makes it really easy to put
them on okay I feel like I really need
to highlight my inner corner I just got
these new chrome pins from Tarte and
they look really reflective so I'm going
to try out the shade top yup whoa my
eyes are quite close say so doing this
makes them look a little bit further
apart I'm gonna use another one of the
pur cosmetics eyeliners this is the
shade reading which is like a really
nice purple and I'm just gonna darken up
that and it just connects it a little
bit more and makes my eyes just look
longer feeling a wee bear and because
those lashes are cut my and they're
still come face you can't even feel them
on I'm just gonna darken this crease up
here let's go in stock my descend again
and see what lip color she wears so her
lips are super fill in the middle so
that's what we're gonna over drawers
like and almost looks like she's not
even reading much thick but she is see
here that's that's amazing I'm just
gonna bring this dark color right under
my eye right under the tear duct almost
I'm gonna do my lips next and then we're
gonna highlight last so she wears it's
almost like a really soft nudey pink
which I literally never wear so pillow
talk is when a Charlotte Tilbury is most
sold lipsticks I believe I don't know
how I'm gonna look with this pink lip
but let's try it so I'm gonna over drama
lips in the top
oh that is pretty I'll give you that
so I'm gonna bronze up my face just a
little bit more with my mic give me son
and we need to highlight don't think
I've caught all I know is I need to
snatch my nose so I'm going to use my
Tarte protocol and Shh SL I'm gonna see
if I can just get that by itself because
I don't need this Pollux I don't like
these two I just like this thing so I
can get that color by itself that would
be perfect
and I'm just using my Becca Smith brush
to start the nose cording to dry I feel
so much better I'm gonna use me Tammy
from dose of colors and the key jersey
collection same thing I used on my legs
and I think it's a bit too dark for me
twig or got stolen and I loved it so
much but wouldn't just even myself out
and then go and talk with something a
bit later I'm going to use all fra Rodeo
Drive yeah we'll just even everything
out yours that just makes your nose look
so tiny when you do a tiny little dot
highlight I think I'm gonna spray my
face with a layer of indicate only or
spray my face to my face is borderline
wait and then I'm gonna add a little bit
of coverage
just like my chin is personal then I'm
just gonna misshaped it to do this and
in the same areas well before I did my
freckle and then just on my forehead I
just wanted to look super smooth better
I'm going to use a little eyeliner like
a liquid liner that says the Marc Jacobs
weren't and I'm going to do my usual
freckle here but I'm also gonna put a
freckle over this spot so I'm just gonna
go in with the black carefully and then
straight on top with my brave Pierre
from Urban Decay same thing here I feel
so much better I really like that
lipstick I can't believe it it's pink
I'm gonna take my offer I will do Drive
and just and I feel like I've managed to
do my makeup different for once may
let's see close but no cigar so you guys
