I'm going to show you how to do this
pink peeper
whew you guys asked for more colorful
looks which I totally understand so I
thought we would create a weird ball
colorful look I actually really like
wearing pink eye shadow the reason I've
not filmed my skin etc is because as the
exact same skin as my fenty Beauty
review so if you want to see how I
created the skin look you can go and
check that out I'll link it down below
and the but if you would like to see how
I create this island and then please
stay tuned
I don't Orange I don't know if that's
two braids okay I'm just gonna go with
this I don't know if it's too bright or
not big lady I am going to show you how
to do this to this so the power I'm
using I just actually got through the
meal and as the jus vias please
many masquerade palette I've not used
this brand before today but how gorgeous
is that I was really excited by the mix
of really gorgeous warm Browns like
these are my tones right here but then
you've got a lot of breaks up here as
well so I was just really excited and I
know that you guys one color I'm doing
color so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to go on with our keynote
Zulu and I'm gonna build up a crease
look back it doesn't come with a manner
in the top so I'm gonna use this little
manner and I'm just going to start
building that up in the crease now
obviously this is a pretty dark color to
start the crease with but when I use
that on the other side it worked really
nicely and my base I've used it's just
cheap tip concealer with powder on top
of it quite a lot of powder so I'm just
placing that color in the crease and
that pigment is just crazy it's really
amazing I got them from Beauty B so I
was excited as well to see that they
were stocked and the UK but the pigment
is just absolutely not the colors are
gorgeous and yet I'm excited I don't
think it's gonna make me want to start
playing with more color I'm just gonna
use my brush and it stayed to start
really diffusing that I like to go right
under that our coroner you guys know
that already and the brush I'm using as
a Smith 232
so the only thing I'd say about the
pallets so far is that there's not
really a mix late transition shades
which it's okay because obviously we've
all got our favourites and we all have
transition shades but that's one thing
that I was kind of wanting to see from
the stage I actually went straight and
with this color here is opal and I'm
gonna use that as a really gorgeous
bright ass purple and I'm gonna use that
underneath my eye like look at that
color
so good would have been that into the
inner corner like that pigment no joke
really really nice and then what I did
from here it was actually pressed that
on to the outer corner and I know some
of you guys prefer when I do both eyes
at the same time but I'm in a little bit
of a lot better honey today I'm actually
catching a flight in a couple hours and
I just wanted to look like a snazzy -
this is another semester fee to brush
I'm just gonna start blending that into
the crease now I'm gonna go on with the
sheer boarding which looks like it's got
a little bit of shimmer to it but when
it's applied it actually doesn't so it
looks like it's got a little flecks of
glitter but it really doesn't and I'm
gonna go under the eye like I just think
I saw gorgeous and I'm gonna go any
crease as well and I'm always placing my
shadows on like that and then left in my
brush up just to start getting that
blend
no-nobody when with a zoeva 2 to 4 and I
wouldn't go in with the mixture of these
two sheets which are called outer and
Fulani I am way too Scottish for all
these exotic shade names sorry if I'm
butchering them all I'm just gonna go
into the crease a little bit just to add
a little bit more depth on the legs I'm
going to go anywhere Calabar here and
then it really went with a little touch
of dier dier down here down here see
what I mean it's no good
i wouldI when was this one and then a
little better this one just missing
and I'm using a Smith - five six brush
which is basically just a flat brush and
I'm just gonna pack that on all over the
lids and I'm just using the product dry
I probably would get that you can use
that way for a more pigment but I don't
really think you need to oh my god that
looks like a flippin mace oh I need to
fix this and then a little bit of this
dajia and the center and that just makes
it a little bit more shiny and makes it
a little bit more defined I don't know
why that's a little messy man dude I'm
gonna do I'm gonna highlight my browbone
note I'm gonna use this in brush but I'm
just gonna wake up on my jockey bombs
make tracks of pants so it's cleaned off
and I'm gonna go in with this shade
geyser geezer just here and I'm gonna go
my brave one I'm just using the same
brush for that because it's got a really
nice little point so you can just set it
right under the brow bone which I like
and I'm actually gonna go on the inner
corner of that color - okay I need to
build up the purple a little bit so I'm
going to go back from at Azure ball and
I'm just gonna build that up and the
crease and then as always going into a
cleaner brush a begger fluffier brush
we're gonna blend that these colors are
just so pigmented but they do actually
blend which just goes to show you can
get pikmin and it'd still be plantable
and then i'm going to go back and with a
fluffier brush and I'm gonna go back in
with the shade Zulu which is this really
beautiful warm brown and I'm just going
to use that and increase just to help
blend any little bits of pigment there
if seem too stuck cool
my top tip is to make sure that you've
got your lashes cut and glued and drying
before you even start mascara because
otherwise your
because to put your lashes on too early
and that's just a recipe for disaster
so I'm gonna chop off my lashes I asked
you guys a little while ago if you
wanted to lash tutorial that is coming
asks for mascara videos is Maybelline
the colossal big short volume Express
this is baddest black and it's in
collaboration with Sheila audience
there's so good I'm just gonna build up
my little lashes and make sure I get my
ball runs as well see that just makes it
look so much better when you bring that
purple shades or ball just slightly in
here and I really like pink eye shadow
because at corn chasse with pretty much
everyone's eye color right I'm just
gonna try and put this on a baby a
little bit still wanna kind of aim for
how much I cut off hmm
too long let's try this no it looks too
sharp s clapping too short I okay that's
fine I'm just gonna go with it honestly
I'm not about to open another set lashes
and then once the lashes are on and
secure even pinnacle back home
obviously when you guys are doing this
eye look I would imagine that you would
do both eyes at the same time which
honestly is probably best but I just
wanted to test out this looks because I
haven't used this palette before and
then as always I like to finish my eye
makeup off by adding more bottom mascara
does mascara is honestly so good for
doing that as well yes so you guys that
is the finished look at some of her
teeth and no I got some of my teeth I
really hope that I've not been there the
whole time so you guys that is the
finished look I just wanted to create
something fun quick and colorful for you
guys it's been a hot second since I did
something right overall I'm really
impressed with this palette really
excited over
I've actually got a couple of other ones
as well there's one other like this when
I
really quickly this is called they're so
hardened by Julia's I think that one
looks really beautiful too I love this
color
jameelah and then I got one other
palette from them from Beauty be I
should see and these eyeshadow pans are
flipping myself look at that so yeah I
just wanted to play with it have some
color and all ages ago one of you guys
are a few of you guys asked for a pink
look so here is pink eye without needing
medication and yeah I hope you really
like it and apart from that I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
