week I am bringing you brand new shiny
growth oil so I have done I think two or
three of these before so the way I've do
my braids has changed as everyone does
and especially with my new products and
new here and I'm not going to just
ignore the fact that I've definitely had
my hair done and I feel like I should
mention it because I'm so happy with
that the same was done by jackbacks
there are at males out here so that's
going to go for my hair Jason but it's
color and and Julia I mean and who rocks
and maids are Israel she specializes in
here jeans which is a certain type of
hid extension that is just like the top
quality it's absolutely beautiful the
heal itself is like silk it's amazing so
I've got extensions to my hair okay not
sure yeah it's not it's not super long
it's actually just for length
healthy-looking here and we've got a
couple of kind of got flashes I kinda
like through it as well just to pick up
the blue a little bit it is actually
violent we use Pravana color and it was
violet and it's made my hair so glossy
and shiny so I'm absolutely elated so
sorry that was a little bit off piece
there if you like to see how I create my
brows these days it's detuned okay let's
do this flaky non flaky Ricky no it's
Ricky okay so starting off I have it
pretty much done at the right time
makeup obviously so one way to do one
who do is I'm going to use their
Anastasia Beverly Hills blowers and
chocolates or this is something that I
have had for a long time and I think
it's one of my favorite ways to create
any shape throws had it been too strong
these days and because I obviously
changing my hair color every like couple
of months
I am I think it easy just to stick with
this product because it will keep my
here and my brain is not the same so I'm
going to start off with this Billy and
I'm just gonna brush my braids up and I
just tweezing trim oh and Rose these
days just because it's easy
and I can do a home and it's free
so I'm just gonna crank this new pencil
up a bit and we're just gonna start with
the tail of the blade
and we're going to fill that in
I'm going to slightly extend the private
oil
and then to fill the front end I'm just
going to use their railroads and little
movements like this just to keep it nice
and light I wanted to look at the front
to be lighter than the end
when you're doing this it's nice to use
this Billy just to kind of brush through
so you can see her your brows look in
and so towards the end of the brow I do
just kind of follow the green of the
natural here but the front I'm kind of
going against it just to make sure it's
filling out any kind of gaps and spaces
once you're happy with the fill then
just give it one last we comb through
and then we're going to do the concealer
so I'm going to use my usual product of
X I don't think I'll to be changing
there's anything to and I just love it
device this is the came in a core an
enhancer and it exports seven so I've
had this for months months months months
and I've not even had half yet leave a
quarter of the way down maybe not even
that but I'm going to use that with my
new Braille aim brush from this Weaver
the new city of a collection that on top
collection this brush is called brow
line as the v-22 brush I am obsessed
with it it's just like a really firm at
well angled brush so I'm going to use
this I thank you are you can use this
with product to get the shape if you're
using the powder products I like to use
it with concealer though so I'm going to
get a little bit the concealer put at
the back of my hand and then I'm just
going to get the brush nice and kortek
I'm going to start underneath the boat
first
and then I'm going to flip my brush
around I'm going to see it on the top
if you want this to be everyone more
dramatic than what I'm doing you can use
a light or conceal our minds eyes
slightly later than must get into into a
well highlight and which I like I like
it to be a little bit later in my brow
if you go too late it can be quite harsh
if you like that go for it if not maybe
sexy the Euro or in skin color also you
don't need to carve out the top of the
braid but I just like to keep it nice
and neat and tidy if you want more of a
natural look just carve out your
underneath and then I'm using the brush
on its sides just to kind of blend the
concealer into my foundation a little
bit more and when I Drive thrown
underneath a little bit too cool now I'm
going to use a dual favorite brush and
I'm just going to blend out a little bit
and I'm going to do this underneath as
well
if you want to make them a little bit
sharper you can go back in with a pay
raise and just growing the perimeter
again which is what NSAIDs are going to
do
and then I'm just going to highlight my
browbone that like I have done another
side with some togarashi shows or just
to say that and the color I'm using for
this is makeup baby this okay guys that
is nice about some flower easy easy way
to fill of my eyebrows this is something
that I've been doing for the last little
while so because you're are using the
plovers it adds a little bit soft don't
feel free if you don't have brain rose
you can just do the same thing but with
pencil or any kind of tractable pencil
as well so sharpened pencil or own
tractable pencil I hoped you liked this
quick little how-to on how I do my brows
these days and I will be back next week
with another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
