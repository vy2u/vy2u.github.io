explained see what's happening here so
this is Drogba so this is for an owl
usually set watch TV etc have fun and
he'll be sitting there looking at
looking out for me watch this for
yeah I'm training them hi guys welcome
back to my channel thanks so much for
joining me this week and today we are
going to go over at this eye look so as
ah
Gorem vampire window smokey eye and I'm
using all makeup geek eyeshadows because
I love them I love them so much I think
of my favorites so yeah last week or a
couple of weeks ago I had my top
eyeshadows from makeup eat her I died
for her I loved so I thought I would do
look using names or a human girl name
you know know how to use them English
would be good wouldn't it if I could
speak English properly that those be
enjoyable for everybody and yeah so if
you'd like to see how I created that
this I like stay tuned okay
look a bit crazy so starting off with
soft ochre by Mac all tame thief we're
just putting a little bit of that all
over the lid not too much that it is
creamy just enough that is sticky it's
just got such a good coverage so it
covers any kind of beans or a
discoloration and know I had my trade
Midori first I'm going to use is a
cupcake which is a really beautiful
dusky pink and I'm just using my sugar
pill blending brush and we're gonna put
that on all over his booth say it all
over I really do
no I just mean in the crease because
you've got that sticky base or and it's
all just gonna blend like a dream
I just love smoking night underneath
it's my favorite thing in the world and
then with a little bit less product
which is good I cannot tackle this aids
tackle the edges of the product make
sure it isn't blended then I'm going to
go in with Cinderella which is slightly
later but it's got a bit of a shimmer
through it and I'm just gonna connect
that lately just that one top just to
help blame the Oh light boys whatever
blend forever and then wonderful and why
the zoeva
looks soft crease brush and I'm going to
go on with the shades bettin which is
the most beautiful plum I've ever seen
in my entire life
I'm just gonna use that in my crease
it's so beautiful and underneath as well
go all of that blue Nate would it look
oh that's dark bull that's dope it's
like that again just going to connect
edges of the shower door what is it
dropper I quite love it
I'm wearing mr. Shirley shade which is
whimsical obviously I will list all
these guys down below for you I am just
using a lot of Illamasqua eyeshadow
brush nice pressed synthetic they are
important needs to be synthetic to pick
up this product cuz this is one of the
foiled eyeshadows so that's why it's
majestic and chemin e so let's do that
literally all over the light find in a
corner - and I'm gonna darken up the
crease with mocha and corrupt some more
color so really nice ashy Thrones and
corrupts just super black there isn't a
brush and then I'm going to go in it
with the lux crease brush from zoeva
with mocha first and I'm just going to
go in between the shower and the purple
tiny little movements
and let's going with corrupt which is
the super black I would have choosing
the tiniest little better that's just
now just right in the corner like I'm
barely touching my eyeball with us brush
actually tiny tiny tiny little movements
yeah man and going back in with my sugar
pal I'm just gonna pull that over again
not touching the center of the dark that
we just felt up because that would be a
waste of time just ruin sites okay
then I'm going to go in with Mac pencil
and Kosta reach which a super loves the
drain I got this when I was doing an I'm
at and I'm just gonna go in the water
linear just to darken up would that be
in too dark okay later time I'm going to
use Illamasqua precision Inc in a bit I
would say this of my favorite liquid
liner but this one's starting to donate
and it came to a little bit Betty so I
had about a hard time for an end I think
we wouldn't have to go and buy another
one but let you see who this close okay
so I'm gonna start off because they
slipped the liner comes rate going to
the tear doctor I'm gonna start off in
the middle and then I'm gonna bring it
down to meet the middle
oh lewb dog here my I delightful
I'm gonna use my new favorite mascara
which is film noir by nabla so Nablus
like have really it's not small it's an
Italian brand sore the quality's
absolutely amazing and it's got a really
good brush that can achieve her stone so
you can get super chunky top lashes and
then use the end to do the bottom lashes
so I am just a huge fan it gives you
laying thick I'm sure volume I've
actually found myself not we didn't
false lashes as much when I use this
mascara and obviously it's super black
it's okay I've got up my face a lot
there along my lash of choice is the
twenty ones you can see they're 21
smiler - got super flaky ie but they do
cost 14 pounds 15 14 15 I am going to
use them 14 times well I'm waiting for
my eyelash to dry I'm gonna take my
little angle brush it's still got some
concealer on it from my brows and I'm
just gonna clean up that Lane
just make everything look much cleaner
yes and that is finished eyelook so it's
pretty bumpy I would say but initially I
wanted to do something with pink tones
to match my hair so I hope you guys
liked this video and I will see you next
week with another one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
