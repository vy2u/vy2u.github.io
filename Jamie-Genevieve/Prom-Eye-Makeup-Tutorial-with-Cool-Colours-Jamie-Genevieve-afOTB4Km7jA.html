you say to me thank you
you gonna be quiet I'll just hit well
good if you don't be quiet really keep
it yes
did you take me to trump hi guys welcome
back to my channel today we are going to
do it as cool toned smokey eye which i
think is perfect before or you get a bit
prom so if you're reading like I kill
pink and a blue I kill purple black even
and I kill some P I will complement that
completely and it means that you can
take use whatever you want in the lips
obviously I haven't renewed to fight for
pain or red lips
whatever I was gonna cool and dress up
in my ball game for the video violets
and dry cleaners so can't do that and I
hope you guys like this tutorial and
I'll be back next week with another one
okay so starting off with soft ochre as
usual all over my eyelids trying to make
the camera work and then go to much
barcelona beach by makeup geek this is
one of their list pan eyeshadows and
they sell their own V Z palette as well
to kind of customize and I'm just using
my fluffy zoeva brush to place that
color in the crease and underneath I as
well this is gonna be our diffusing
color so making sure that's beautifully
blended as always and then I'm gonna go
in with sex by Illamasqua which is just
a matte white eyeshadow and I'm gonna
use that as my highlight so putting that
in the spotlight of the eye just on the
lower lids and then on the inner corner
kind of packing on the color as a brow
bone highlight as well
going in with Incubus by Illamasqua a
really nice charcoal matte gray and this
is what's gonna make the eyeshadow look
really cool in color not cooler than
like cool but coolers and like a cold
color and because it's a bit darker it's
going to Kanaka be the depth that you
need just before we put on the black
eyeshadow so just quite a circular
smokey eye that's one which is the most
compliment today I would say for
everyone and smell it your blending good
name is corrupt by a cup geek which i
think is my new favorite black hairy
shards or it's super dark matte and it
blends really easily as well and I'm
just using a makeup addiction brush
there that we crease brush and then
using the deliever smolder brush the
little can a pencil brush just to buffer
it the black underneath the eye as well
remember as always you can go as heavy
or as light with these colors as you
want rubber suits you then I'm going to
use min spin by urban decay which is one
of their proper remedy shimmery
eyeshadows a little bit effects plus on
the vase 3 palette brush the again and
I'm just gonna pack that on top of the
white spotlight this gives you that
beautiful kinda shimmer then I'm using
the St Lauder Double Wear a smoke pencil
which is super pigmented and very tacky
Israel so it lasts in the waterline
which isn't necessary and I'm just gonna
color in the fill waterline with that
then I'm using gel liner by Illamasqua
infinity the blackest gel liner I've
ever came across and I'm just gonna do
create a thin layer nor that got
anything because of has a rounded spoke
and I'm just gonna lay the top die
pretty much so we've got a base to put
the eyelashes on and so it's all
seamless they're a coating of mascara
this is the urban ski black curling
mascara which I really like because the
brush is plastic and I do like a plastic
applicator and then pop on up here your
favorite eyelashes these are the Eldora
m106
it'll Dora are my favorite lashes and
that is how easy it is so it gives you a
beautiful
salt
smoke not too difficult but it gives you
that can a drama that you're worn in for
your prom No
thank you so much for watching guys and
I hope you have a nice prom and I will
see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
