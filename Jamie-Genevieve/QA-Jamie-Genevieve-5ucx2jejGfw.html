Scotland hi guys so today we're going to
do the Q and E which I was meant to post
yesterday but we're going to do it we're
going to do that today
because my camera decided not to work so
just starting off on Instagram under the
couny most of the comments we are how
did you start doing makeup so I started
I worked at a seal order for two years
and for the first six months of that job
I wasn't studying makeup at all so I
just started in working on the corner
and I got into the college course before
I got the job so we it for six months
and I started doing the college course
and I did that for two years and six
months before I finished the course I
got the job Ella masca so I was working
and on makeup Kona is the filter what
was at college which helped a lot C was
for Karen Suk Chul's obviously get
discounts and things like that so I got
most of my kit during that time and I
was constantly practicing and work and
in college is really kind of went hand
in hand next question who did you get
your job Ella mascara
that's from sniffers and makeup and what
was your interview process so I got a
job at Alaska by applying and the
interview process was I applied and then
I had a phone interview after that I had
a makeup trial so you go onto the cone
oh you bring a model with you and they
give you a face chart and what you've
got to recreate and sex people go I
count our trial and I got the job so
that's very happy what brought you into
the makeup field what inspired it from
Creston levert and I don't know I did
our I studied art for a year a forensic
college and I ended up doing makeup for
people's portfolio pictures and I loved
I thought it was a best friend of her
and I've always been quick and Jason and
me cup itself and at that point I think
one of my flames was doing makeup and I
thought it looked amazing and she can
inspired me a bit to call for it how did
I go around becoming a makeup artist
that's from Tyria louise sorry um I
don't think it really you don't become
my makeup as soon as you start studying
out anything your sin is your desi key
and I've time and if right into it and
you start to grow and you start to get
better I think then and once you've
worked and then just years really and
you can call yourself a makeup artist
obviously I studied for two years and I
got a degree in develop my Hindi and
that made it offends like see having a
certificate fairly really I'm a makeup
artist nay but before I graduated I was
working on Kona I was doing freelance
job so I don't know when you become a
makeup artist okay how long have you
been doing makeup professionally that's
from Hannah cousins and I when doing
makeup since I bought the job I sold
over when I was 17 so I'm 21 no four
years four years but I used to play her
in a moment face all the time I mean
nights I'm sure you can tell that from
Instagram all I do is practice makeup
all the time every single day I try a
new look and things like that lots of
people ask again what course I went to I
went to clay bank college and New
Glasgow and I'm sure that's called West
Coast Scotland no and I did the hitch
and decoy so the fresh deer I did will
teach in see I skipped into the very
chancy it was mostly fashion makeup so
it was very basic three or so we need
four I start doing it you feel it's
quickly repetitive but it does help your
technique and things like that and the
HND was a special-effects year so we did
all the character makeup special effects
it was those different stuff a few
people last on her I drew on the
freckles for the look ages ago I used a
brown lip pencil and black Lena but a
bear with to it which I've done today
I've just drawn over my real freckles is
with our brown mascara and just use a
tiny little brush and paint on that way
I hope that helps
Mika Miko's and Ford X all
asks where do you hope you'll be in five
years somewhere sunny Cimmerian actually
get tan because trust me I'd normally to
be this peel I'm not born to be this
bill what's your all-time favorite
lipstick Kashmir what made you want to
work for Ella masca that is from Chile
blush everything as soon as I saw the
company I thought it was amazing all the
color and the girls who worked for them
Israel who I worked with know I thought
they looked amazing because they're
related to whatever they watch with her
makeup I mean I worked a steel or the
rear I was very subtle such a la natural
beauty
Emily Walters my favorite products of
all time I think has to be that's a
horrible crash I'm asked too hard
maybe scan be his foundation by
Illamasqua it's the only thing that I
never break out with and I think it's
the best rendition in the world also
blow cake biomass car because it's
incredible as oh that's too difficult
I don't Lincoln which eyeliner product
do thing gives you the best precision as
these boots from Kelly Lea and P
probably LMS Co precision Inc and I've
gotten just know it doesn't come off I
just spilled it all over my unit doesn't
come off what should advice for someone
looking to start out in the makeup
industry dead you need to get quite
qualifications from college for working
as a makeup artist
that's from Lior corner at night before
no as long as you're putting yourself
out there and you're applying for jobs
and you're often your services like I
did so much work for free before I did
anything and I wouldn't say you did a
quality qualification from college to
see you to me apart it's not at all and
all those people are self-taught they're
absolutely amazing one of the girls I
worked with in Illamasqua self-taught
and she's incredible so no you don't
need a call call it
why can I say that College qualification
you definitely don't need one and
started out right just get yourself like
a basic kit and constantly practice on
your phone face and get your makeup I
like show people what you can do and if
you see any jobs like fashion brands
that needs makeup for a look book or
something or for your services and just
try your really hard days that's that's
how I started treatment
and it helped so much quite a few people
asked me what was set up four photos are
and videos in what apps I use so that
certain question is from lethargic
superhero and elite the fact that she
has tags more videos they did thank you
very much and my setup for photos as for
videos i'm using my canon 1100 d aim I
got this one birthday when I was 18 and
because I thought was going to be
photographer but I was I'm not and it's
clip of filming videos for all my
pictures on Instagram I used my
front-facing camera on my phone and I've
got a really good Wendel right here that
lets own perfect not like late and it
just meets the camera work it's very
based I think that's all I use apps wise
and to flip my pictures over and things
I use an app called Peck flame I also I
just downloaded a new one called fawn
hall which is really good for a pit and
takes over and over J's and Instagram
obviously he doesn't love an insta
filter
Brooke Simon mue asks if it was illegal
to have more the city makeup items
god forbid what products would you have
again horrible horrible question me
personally what I need every day is
blows foundation of lipstick like my
eyes will look like tiny little spots in
my face but if I had my nude lipstick my
foundation and my blaze on I'd feel at
least semi glam so there you go what is
your favorite musician /rs flash band
that's from grease Mel's play Lana Del
Rio love Lana Del Rey Java favorite
foundation it's going to be a foundation
by Illamasqua

the kindest person I've ever met in my
entire life and she's just thoughtfully
and she worked so so hard and anything
that she wants she gets

that's amazing workwise
I thank people like Alex bak think she's
done so well for herself and I think
she's like when I met her she's just so
lovely Israel like it's just not going
to hurt at all and I think I would like
to end up like that I'd like to be
successful but I went obviously humble I
would never he I would never like see

old and my downturned eyes do you
suggest cutting them down a bruiser
baseless the term I have Illamasqua for
teens in yet see if you've got a pillow

that I mean that they're way just in the
middle and then the further away equally
both sides cut them in half and then
switch them and then put them on just
add outside because it will look like a

seeing I saw you today because it's
creepy just see how he seeing highs much
looser even said again asked who
inspired you when you first started
doing makeup and who inspires you know
when I first started doing makeup and my
friend Kara inspired me because and that
we and realize that until years after
but when I was 14 I went to the benefit
counter because everyone loved benefit
and I was sitting and she it was her
that Seraph me and she sat me down and
she went through everything I'd needs
and she did my makeup for me and I was
sleeping with my mother kami saying I
looked so much for here that get all the
call me and I'll try rising when she
sees me and then we bought everything
else for Christmas about absolutely
everything and had that makeup and I
never forgot about her and then one day
I was getting off the train in my
hometown and she was there and I said oh
my god she lives she lives really close
to me exclusive in and I saw on Facebook
that she said makeup and I started
meeting with her and then we actually
ended up being best pals and I totally
forgot it was her and it wasn't until it
last year that I realized it was powder
that actually served me so I love her
she's one of my best friends and I had
to say that she like inspired me
beginning him know even though she sells
inspires me there's two people that I
always look up on YouTube and I always
look at their Instagram because I think
that their works unreal and they are
make e underscore who is glam Igor on
YouTube and Samantha so let's Samantha
before it is at the beginning I think
their works amazing I
in evidence II I'm obsessed like you
know that we a few met that I might have
I made them I don't know why - I think I
just be like I have you're too nervous
or yeah
definitely their future aspiration is
slash ambition again I think I really
want to move somewhere sunny I might
want to live here for much longer even
though my family's here and I think they
would like to see me travel a bit as
well I don't know I'd love to see like
like Instagram obviously that was a
complete surprise to me I never thought
my Instagram I take off at all and it's
so exciting and it makes it all feel a
bit more worthwhile in YouTube Israel I
would love to see them both connect
gradually increase the way that they're
going to know I'd be deleted I feel
really happy and I'd like to get I
definitely like to get into the States
and how we look around maybe collaborate
with more companies and stuff like on it
and yeah that would be good that would
be cool both sides like a dream like if
that happens I'll be so so happy if it
doesn't what I totally Fame perfect I
think we're nearly done love makeup
girls would say is a personal leave
question mark boyfriend eh uh dodo um I
don't know what that means
personal life but if you ask me I've got
a boyfriend yes I do and there is like I
don't know why all she wanted over me so
your question sucks blue-haired pecks
essays do you rate your teeth f soul
with the oldest / wait no i don't but
thank you very much that's lovely
I feel like going getting it done though
that you've made - no underscore Georgie
underscore II who I love you make up be
real done your face is great
I was asking to have any other hobbies
and taste other than makeup I do
actually I really like skiing
I love my skin and ages but I love Nate
says ski slopes I started learning how
to ski when I was four and by the time I
was 13 I've done all my labels or
whatever you call them and I was skating
down the black schools and it's nil a
mat like when it's in our shopping of a
love drive and I recently passed my
diving taste
in me just perform a 21st birthday and I
rock my car and I Drive every day like I
loved - I'm going to Manchester on the
29th overnight to go to the Trafford
Centre see you shopping again so yeah I
like shopping I like driving a like
skiing
I like playing my ps3 I like sleeping a
lot and I love watching other people's
YouTube for did you like videos and but
so you just know like I'm working really
hard at this so I don't have much of a
time whether free time I have I spend it
with my friends or chillin or I don't
know doing more makeup quite sad dumb
doing I'm quite sizable yeah how did you
learn your makeup skills did you study
anywhere or are you self-taught I'm
going to go back into that because in
all honesty even though a lot of college
it was really fun and I met lots of
really good friends like some obvious
trades just now um I think I learned a
bit more practice in myself and
constantly watching YouTube tutorials
and like seeing her everyone else I said
I'm working on Kona because of some
cones with a picture of a face and says
I want this makeup you just have to do
it and that's scary but it makes you
learn makes you do it so I think the
most practice that you can get and like
even if your friends are going or
whatever I do their makeup for them and
constantly did definite things in your
own face like try different colors try
different shapes things like that like
look at images get magazines Dazed and
Confused is amazing for a crazy makeup
and that's the time for the time being
so I do understand that a lot of these
creations we're just literally makeup
related and I quite like that
no one really asked me that's me all
done thank you so much for watching
and I'll be right next week with a
makeup tutorial if you liked what you
