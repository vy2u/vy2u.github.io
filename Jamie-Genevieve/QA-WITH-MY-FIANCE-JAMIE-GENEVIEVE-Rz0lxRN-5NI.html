[Laughter]
we screenshot it and then we'll cut it
hi guys welcome back to my Channel today
I am joined by my big sister
Jack and my fiancée and you might have
seen him if you watch our weekly vlogs
but we obviously party a nose for the
weekly vlogs containers both we've also
done a couple of videos together know
that maybe not as many as I would like
not as many as you'd like I'm sorry
you're not tired today we are doing
equation and I'm sorry I asked you guys
on Twitter a few weeks ago actually if
there are any questions that you had and
you guys had put into your questions so
we won't be able to answer them all but
really you can answer some regression
line as well well we're not stuck we're
not not pre-planned any questions no
we've not really I have the tweet up
here right now is everyone's giving the
week and you guys put all your questions
up to me for a minute
answers to that there was 400 so 400
questions unfortunately we don't have
time for them all but let's just start
the Lacey this is from Charlotte closer
here's one of my bridesmaids hi
Charlotte family friend and she says
okay difficult one
Richard would rather have a heavy at you
feet for the rest of your legs are ranks
like he ranks for the rest of your lives
oh I don't know I think he'll probably
it's just a cheesy @gp
I see behinds were stuck in I had to do
my makeup I would just feel so
disgusting every day actually feet low
you can just kind of like is Dain
yourself right from it and be like it's
not real it's not real I just can't
stand being a cheap so I go hannes all
right Charlotte this is from a balloon
when and where did you first meet we
first met at music festival years ago
when I was a finger with you the first
Peter 16 a kind of amber but it was a
teen the park drove so it was a teeny
park and I saw Jack from across the
drinking circle you're four years older
than me it's hanging when I was 15 or 16
that's quite a big age gap and I just
fell over from Jimmy Jackson Jack says
and I can't remember this you said hello
to me and I didn't respond
just for this mm-hmm there was quite a
heavy fish not for weeks
mm-hmm is where we first met
this is from with Danny Clark 1985 how
do you feel working together just
wondering as a couple is it difficult to
live and work together you always seem
really happy a kiss kiss era of a
detainee we are happy I think we're so
lucky because I am a queen we meet the
leap of working together as well as
living together and be together we've
listened it in O'Hara scooter neck no
read no idea that we start the flock yes
he was very faithful my community when
we first started doing it it was a lot
harder beavers were stealing the small
plate like fly apartment flats apartment
no it was really flat I stayed in a flat
slash apartment dude so obviously there
was enough space to escape each other
things if things went pear-shaped but
obviously we moved us made the
transition of working together
I think so too I think see because we've
got all right host know we've got this
space to think I've got my own room
obviously the family room and it's good
because we do go to each other the team
that we need but at the same time we
work together the world is this from
campus I think is Kimberly birth
I am wondering what Jack does for work
or if he helps with your channel mostly
allows we said we start just let that
leg denim how you said we started
working together a year ago and then
before that I was a black Leo I want my
dad
I think actually the funny thing because
it was good and the first the way that
Jack we enjoyed today the videos was I
just showed him what I knew so you'll
know is that no I actually noticed that
you read in the videos we didn't say it
for a long time
Jack come here it's a big I knew and
then they Jericho so good like our last
fall that we just put up today all the
votes get so many amazing comments with
it and stuff like that in that song
track we were together so tight so Jack
this all the air then he also takes all
my photos you also just helped me with
the business side of things you travel
visa mmm
Poochie pie Sankei the boys Jimmy sing
it like the learning curve was pray
steep when we first started because I
didn't really know I've always been
interested only the technical say the
fellowman and stuff like that but I've
never studied there or been hands-on
intensely with it meaning the videos and
the vlogs and things all that then put
in the mode to so many people and see me
unpack the house is incredible so thanks
for that sweet one for me this is from
Wally underscore names names for Jimmy
what does Jack do the most eternal you
by the way at love he'll love you too
Jack has no patience see if there's a
task at hand that would be take 10
minutes to do jack will spend five
minutes doing it and then get frustrated
I can't do this I don't really get
my project I know I can be quite
impatient yeah I'm patience nor the
first thing obviously about that just
from Jimmy Dean loves about people tweet
this one what a night here was really
nice no questions asked mace if I could
take the camera and show you there in
this place or with the factors maybe
that's the case quite clean just know
because it's just been cleaned Bob thank
you jamie is so messy messy messy messy
mess a whole thing well I think that's
another thing that annoys me for you
it's Jack it's not me see Jack has like
a mother clinically claims no you can't
even figure Debbie no it's the most
hated person no you are if you're boring
Jack's like a little drawer all those
things are always in a really neat Lane
everything is parallel to each other
there was gonna say Mordor they were
seen that let's just don't see the heart
tongue nice poor fella picture eyeball
what is your guys favorite board game to
plea to what I say three to one then
we'll see it yeah okay
this hasn't been pre-planned in three
two one
articulate that's really ridiculous oh
there's a nice foreign this is from pop
the Ashford one what's your favorite
thing about Jack and Jack's favorite
thing about you my favorite thing about
you as a changer you're the nicest
person ever made my entire life I wanna
make you try Wayne I started taking Jack
Soviets and things like that everyone
that you meet you pretty much become
friends with you've got such a good
judge of character
yeah good-looking I think yeah you're
just it's okay thank you very much okay
your time again my favorite thing about
Jimmy
is kinda they seem Jimmy puts herself
before anyone else
yeah she thinks about other people's
feelings before I wouldn't like
constantly not just me like mom and dad
know that can't think I'm pretty
this one's put on FG floor I think I
aced more hit GS law which tattoo is
your favorite sushi can you do your
regular latex I think the same way out
which tattoo is your favorite to both of
you obviously the Jack Carter
Jack heart that last one was the most
meaning static one is you can inflate
two skull in the mouth I didn't like
your new leg your new like Jack Jack's
got like a rule it's all the way
activated really cool but it needs to be
finished but apart from that I like your
no Kosovo Jack's fault is 17 on his
knuckles and between all the reference
desk question is from Kaylee mue
and as where is her favorite please that
Europe was traveled together
aside from New York seeing as Jack is
already went to see that most likely I
would actually probably pick the Maltese
which is somewhere we've just came back
from it was the most stunning place
that's definitely seen Kelly Los Angeles
as my favorite we've been there a bunch
of times now but Jack absolutely and I
actually really do love it too but
because I think it's still familiar to
me that people will mirror the other
friends what means that's the reason Oh
show that to you home this version is
from vixx it's a weak who are uric so
every eight crushes I think means Tom
Hart a crime eater
I like coming in the others when I was
younger and the master mask yeah and the
mask cabbage and mascara she was my
number one like pure body state the fact
that was younger than puberty no one
when you're so young she was like so and
ten managers like anyone from a young
age I had the bucket drop causes she was
like my favorite child Jack gonna pocket
talk to Tom cards and the Cameron Diaz I
was his favorite
don't ask me who you wanted my and
stardew valley I'm kind of off that hate
right now
that's one is from Christy underscore at
Madison if you could be in any TV show
which would it be and what character
would you want to please love you guys

Vampire Diaries and I would play the
ghetto for so good okay you guys know
why she good-looking her man on stage
and demon to vampire honks probably told
me she'll be picky blenders make a yeah
boo mingoo he's comin my day is sherry
da seven when did you get your first P
of single means when my ears when I was
eight
yeah my mom woke me up and she's like
which I think to get your ears pierced
today and I was so excited and I make my
ears pierced
and the next thing I woke up really yes
because what was a dream because it was
weeks a.m. dad doesn't have any anymore
but you had sneak rates here I think it
was actually my left told over his head
and like money to like that I used up a
lot of Pierce's my years HD but well
that that's one is from honey lychee do
you both get on with each other's
parents yes yes yeah we're really lucky
you've got brilliant experience what I
was proposed to Jimmy my mom and dads
were one of the first people to know not
long after I was Jimmy's dad so I
remember cause that name she had this
face this was from wealth Madelyn when
did you realize you were like a legit
switch will media influencer and knew
that you could call this your full-time
job when I was getting offered more work
there than I was makeup jobs because I
was feeling good doesn't makeup artist I
was doing just fine I loved it I started
getting so many jobs as an influencer
that my earnings
show up door so I was making more money
as an influencer and beautiful a makeup
artist I was also getting offered
amazing opportunities that I couldn't do
the course but I was busy and sound so I
decided to swap over and I haven't
looked back since I was already left
Daleks that's when electronics I would
never seen ever to being a freelance
makeup artist
it was a really good time in my life I
still love it but yeah that was it
there was no certain numbers or age like
that because I think it really depends
on the individual but it comes to jobs
and things like that
Gemma see McLean what's the most
ridiculous ridiculous and capital
letters argument to your heart there is
one time this one time at band camp and
I really wanted to watch a film with
those things in the coach because since
I remember I've always wanted to have a
house with an amazing living room they'd
spent amen and it'd be like family time
it would be green and Jack said no I
would've got suited watching vids and he
always does this
I'm more of a laptop when the world can
I go yeah on this occasion Jack told me
no I would like to watch out Susan Big
Bertha crying I was like he had already
saved me I got super excited
Lenny broke my dreams and then I were
sick trying and therefore the cage
anyway I think that was whatever you
were coming up your makeup room and the
word of Allah three hours after you
thought I generally asked me
okay I talked to Leah
by little bit less than so many craters
were the way then and honestly it's very
funny
our schedule recently is been so hectic
that would not entertain they plan to
take over to Italy we were thinking to
get married and Scotto
but because it schedule of course
they'll be able to we're hopefully gonna
go over in April and start doing new of
the proper planning and stuff by the
moment were engaged and happy and Rafi
get my next year
Becky canvassed 74 say will you please
adopt me sure thing miss Atreyu good
condo
what is it - it's a rock band I don't
know if she's using it as that Bob okay
this I don't the good one jack is to be
showing on periscope away your but what
made them come over his shell with being
on camera that's a good one I think
because you dad used to be shy that just
kind of started realizing their each
other and things like that obviously it
would've been blown at the time the nice
thing is Jack had came into this world
really slowly and naturally
anything he came he did it because you
see what you're doing things or how many
people are watching I know how many
people were like watching it and that
was obviously quite scary at they tell
you never having any experience do your
governor and say and do your life
it's obviously it's personal stuff but
you can see how many people enjoy
watching it and obviously see how
comfortable Jamie as with it rubs off
having your good having your funny fake
feta cheese we're gonna answer one more
question
forty days later so many that's a good
one and I think Polly's function tell
each other a confession they don't know
about you don't know that when I made
dinner I picked the best one when you're
charged okay yeah if you guys to eat a
checkoff when you steal your food you're
not Lincoln the dogs make comments guys
I'm surprised I knew that they would
otherwise when we were first good out I
was so obsessed a food that had a black
buddy and you know how you could change
the color like I said a new potato
different color I changed Jack's to good
eatin so whatever Drago takes green like
green is good I used to like
purposefully leave my for in another
room and if I heard a call I would like
for me like and then it was like every
two flashes mechanics akin to way and
I'd be like oh God
and I was so obsessed Church yeah that's
my confession I was a walk or you know I
knew like show me yes it is like so
really don't come in Odesa

notice and it doesn't happen Jamie
