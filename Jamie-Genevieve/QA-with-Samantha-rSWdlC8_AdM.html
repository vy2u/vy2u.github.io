such a dream come true for me see

heart what's it what's the national
anthem Oh Canada as I said Oh Canada

do my gotcha proud I'm secretly hired by
the Canadian uh travel board yeah and
that's a bad you're just inviting
everyone I didn't I know Jamie I'm like
I won over Canada what were your first
impressions of each other oh yeah that's
a good question and a good one
okay um my first French or first person
meeting you less people
my very first impression of you when I
saw you on periscope is that I was like
holy I can't understand you at all
I was just so shocked like like I
thought you can't understand her I like
and I like would wash your face cousin I
tried like really like really listening
like get used to your accent kind of
thing and then my first impression when
I met you is that you were taller than I
thought you were going to be mmm I think
you are you look like your photos but
you're like prettier in person and um my
first pressure is even I really like
witty and funny that's amazing
that's pretty I'm in there man I would
never you're see Megan oh I was oh yeah
I told you first so I really know when I
start following your vitamin Bertie
hugglebar can you Instagram I'll
remember the forest fool that's all
first impression when I met you was
you're so much more petite then I
thought you're gonna be junk god no I
say she saw like it she's just so tiny
and and in small it's so cute it's okay
I'm weird to see you moving your legs I
see when you follow someone for so long
you used to see them on the screen see
we need to learn like 3d it's weird it's
not you're always a just just this
gorgeous a new like I've no more hide
behind because you're just like that
right he's so good-looking
yeah that was presentation for sure I
think I get that 100 that not going to
petite but that I'm short
every time it's funny she's not even
sure I'm I'm not sure that's why I was
so avidly hided I'm not a short person
I'm classic excites excise normal yeah
love people think I'm short it even when
I wear heels like I will I was
specifically wear heels to events and
people still say I'm sure I'm tall any
old it like almost 16 heels yeah good
anyway people will still be like people
still be like oh wow you're sure that I
thought like clamoring over you
and I mean if you had to compare each
other to a make up I um hope would be oh
um if I compare you to a make up item
yeah I thought I was like if I was like
a little bit make up in your head a
little bit make up flow by makeup in
your makeup bag I think that I would
either peg you as like a really dark
smokey eye shadow
or like a highlight she's like yeah I
was like I was actually just looking at
my highlight and the lanes and I was
like what's uh oh god it would you what
do you think I would like to say that an
extreme corset so we sold that color
lipstick totally nude lips take out the
bikini ones
sheer sheer sheer nude lipstick cuz I
have never used sheer lipstick before my
life but isn't nice yes because I
literally always watching jobs or makeup
I was like what's that
what is that fresh air that she's
putting on her lips okay
I can't see anything going on but I
really like it and a weird so much nicer
during the day that I'm at you know when
you get that new deal it Blaine yeah
it's like especially my own sticks it's
like oh you can't eat with everything
that that silence she lipsticks it's
just like fades fades and then it's just
your nice lip color and then that you're
done yeah or like everything a sleepin
like natural bring a nice natural prop I
did about natural the other day and
she's like take away okay I actually
feel a little more hope right here it it
is a lot less like harsh like you I see
my brows really harsh and kind of thing
yeah I remember like the first time I
did a natural brows like I'm just like
girl next door okay hey hey that's why
man must be good okay I got a good one
okay
oh it's kind of the same though but it
was one thing you guys were surprised
about meeting each other like surprised
by other than height I guess other than
like oh why am I do this one like but in
a bad way
Ike I don't have any seed about you I
know what you looking for me hey boy boy
suffice you're not in place where
nothing really
Oh smoking let's see I don't actually
care
I don't bug you about it hey dude but I
way I was I wouldn't have assumed that
you smoked
yeah like I would have paid you for some
or bad on paying a personal grandmas
daily post for smoking I've tried to
talk too many times and after Thailand
that's me done so I'm gonna need your
ear like I've made a point almost of not
seeing like it's not hard to not bring
it up cause it's not hard to not bring
it up but I feel like if I bring it up
and I see that I'm gonna stall no it was
gonna be like smoking going to know that
I got good just look like that's good
yes that's why I'm saying it now I
wouldn't need everyone's help
after Thailand
myself at that time okay well I suppose
one thing eyes you only ah what oh
that's isn't necessarily bad a lot but
it is you were wearing much less makeup
and I thought you died really yes I
don't see like after spheres skin
through a foundation all because I was
more international data she wasn't my
foundation ID whatever as I am I have
never worked like I make uprising
website with a foundation before my
entire life I never did either but like
that I started doing it this summer what
a more 10 if you okay with it yeah it's
the same thing as like the sheer
lipstick like with it I don't like how
many foundation wear throughout the day
yeah but like I would rather like once
you get used to seeing your skin without
foundation on it it's not that bad
and then like I like how it wears
something because I like that I can like
wipe my face I like that I can like
touch over food your hatchet I can I
clean on things I can like have my
sweater up like anything like that like
I like that yeah because I don't have to
worry about my foundation it make a good
argument
yeah it's sound crazy that is crazy
if you could pick an age to be stuck in
forever you still mentally get older and
wiser which one would be so like I guess
physically oh no that's a good one I
don't know what I don't know if I like
it better like myself barely er I feel
like I would say 21 because then he'd be
like and although he should do
everything everywhere to like you travel
somewhere and not be able to otherwise
I'd say younger but like I think I would
say 21 but at the same time like I don't
know if I'm gonna like my appearance
that I went to older yeah I would say
the exact same thing because I was very
hostile later I was 21 yeah pleasure
fair back in good old days
good ol days if you had to also go
mentally with the age kind of thing like
it wouldn't be like I get wiser and
wiser kind of thing like if you had to
stay the mentality that you were that
age I think I'd say older yeah it's a
probably very very 29-yard ratings I'm
just a training yeah yeah then I fill my
twenties I don't know till 20 let it
strong oh yeah I think let's do one more
than okay I mean okay okay if you could
change one thing about your life what
would it be I don't know
you do know yeah okay if I could pick up
my flat dog Jack everywhere like all my
family thinks that kid about pick them
up and like move them I know we just
just stayed somewhere semi in the pan
but I would honestly say Canada no I
would just like like that there we go he
knows as easy as that
I would I would definitely move away
from here for sure yeah
how are you know I think that I wish
that I could change my mentality towards
things my thing like I wish that I could
change the fact that like you know I get
motivated or whatever cuz I think that
um it's really really easy for me like
how personal it was really easy for me
to get I'm motivated and the worst part
is that like I'm aware of it it's not
even like I'm like oh I work so hard
kind of thing like it would always be
better if I was like naive to the fact
but like yeah I'm not like I know that I
would motivate I know it like I don't
like work hard enough basically I didn't
go change my mentality you can do that
this year
routine having like Daisy film they were
hate routine okay yeah good for you yeah
that's all trying to travel someone get
into routine where I travel we learn and
work
