today I am going to show you how to
achieve this I look I will be using the
new tired
Manny chocolate best look I it's super
correct for one thing and I think it's
really nice and kind of grungy but it
doesn't take too long it's kind of
things that suits everybody in a
dramatic under life smoke is obviously
one of my Steve's things ever unless
those to me we just can explain the
moment tutorial it's all super casual I
just what to do some makeup with you
guys
I'm actually really Malik Tariq gym
clothes that they sent me which is are
actually I slept in this last name and
it's to comfiest thought okay all that I
saved and you like see actually it is a
lit speaking what's up guys green under
some makeup first thing I'm going to do
and I'm going to lien law well I've
actually already done it but lien law
lien law rule I'm winning is this is
really sad really sad real computer
blender and droppers work but that's
just my lien wall beauty blender notes
of what I do is it just do that all over
my eyes and then I've actually already
said that with a translucent powder
so the tons of the project that is my
favorite is the Kat Von D translucent I
had been sent me last year and it
honestly felt ill and I use it every day
so to not recommend anymore 10 entertain
wealth purchase okay the palette I'm
using C as the manager palette by Tarte
I've used in a couple of edges before
but this is by far one of my newsfeed
palette it's nice its small its little
print
Takia create and tertiary it's a really
beautiful palette the colors in here I
will use them all so I'm just a huge fan
so I just set this I to be and I thought
it's actually really quick easy look to
do so it's got a really perfect for you
guys
the bag is going to do so and the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
grab the she's passion which is just
here and really put that on all or let's
say that set up these the next way I'm
going to do is I'm going to go in with a
mix of the shades part and so say these
two here this one's more about
Pentti transition shade and that one's
more of e can a nice warm gray so I'm
going out to just mix those together and
then same old same old
we're going to start popping out and a
crease because what I means might be
it's going on nice and seamlessly no
parity net and then I'm always just kind
of help my brush up to help blend up
towards the gray and notice you'd mix
together orange like the nicest
relationship ever
give me go back one second silver Java
go back home you can hear right now
can you say you've been a rascal your
hormones are too much too much so the
kind of key to this look is keeping it
kind of later on the top I'm going to
end with a tiny touch of this midnight
she'd which is the darkest color but I'm
not using that much just a little bit
and I'm just going to pop that right and
exist and then I'm just going to use the
brush with hardly any product on it and
I'm just gonna just kind of smoking at
far less look underneath eye is a lot
darker than on top one of my favorite
cannot lips to do so I'm going to take
the sheeted resonate theory on my morphe
MF sidewall seven brush one of my favs
is really good she's really little small
and we're going to start can actually
fit underneath the lower lash line and
I'm bringing that right into the inner
corner and then I'm going to swap my
brush over to the cursory or vice mess
with your dirty nose no judgement and
we're gonna mix the shoes met Nate and
soft face and then just brush it a
little bit better so I'm just going to
not leave out underneath my eye and just
smoke that out I'm quite far enough that
I like to drop the shadow right in
because we've got over concealer on
already so that's almost like a base for
underneath my
I'm going to go back to my little morphe
brush and the she's missing again and
I'm going to slightly one left eye
underneath the eye so this is really
easy all you do as you kind of fold the
lower lash line i and it gives you that
nice kind of elevation here it's like a
kind of lower lower lash loopy when i
used to do it old time if you've been
here for a while and then i'm just going
to start built into that darker color
right underneath the lashes the warm
color that I'm using solfege is here
really helps blend I start from a smooth
blend underneath but if you look I
blamed it so far I've got two partners
for you you don't have to do that
program so for the inner corner as
really important to get a really nice
and very consciously - Susu grungy and
dark so visually I do that I'm next -
she's meow
yeah only there's no animal face relief
and I'm just going to make sense
together to shave me I was quite ladies
on fight I'm packing that on with a Eva
shader brush which is two three four
later updates before most of the brushes
that I love and use a lot I have less
than at the bottom all my videos and you
can see how great that is
and then I'm just gonna use my back two
to four disciplines Allah I'm going to
go end with the shade leave again I like
this pads because this highlight she's
making back I'm going to take actually
lays on my breath so the last of I'm
using I just got these delivered
yesterday they are the Mancha V lash
from face over lashes they're really
really cute they're synthetic as well
which is good and I use my glasses a lot
so I thought I would change it but
that's I've gotten on the site already I
really think that they're lovely
so as always I've left my lashes to dry
I put the glue on I'm going to leave
them to dry for a little oil
I'm little strip mascara again this corn
ball and saw amazing through the
man-eater mascara from
which was the same collection as manager
palette and a little core of my lash
from the bar on top we considered a
strength so you can see my eye here so
what I'm going to do drums Chris start
littleness mascara on so even one quart
demand here miss Cardozo means in it but
I feel like the band mascara just locks
everything in and they wet a lip like
this but it's super drums underneath I
like to have thick bottom lashes so once
we've done the top coat you can see
already that mascara I'm using have
incredible that module can to see if you
don't wear lashes if you're not a big
fan of lashes then business cards music
school great so I've had quite a few
Croatian additionally on how to apply
false lashes first thing to do and make
sure that the arch improperly it's will
always trim from the outside end to the
longest parts and they divide make sure
we can properly either for just a little
bit too long we will drag you on NSAIDs
and that usually me fries water and make
some kind of editing techniques you want
to appeal my eyeball out I'm going to
grab this I'm going to take my little
palette just help and I'm going to put
that underneath my face like this and
look down and just set those lashes line
it up and then what you can do is when a
my favorite utensil is my tart little
lash applicator and you can just squeeze
flash on so it's super close to on
lashes for easy just like that and that
you guys is the finished look this is
obviously a quite romantic would sell
but it keeps Milton tall honestly it's
really really positive and I think it's
just perfect if you're like me and you
need something just a lot bit funky for
day to day it's perfect and then if you
guys don't worry too much makeup through
the week and you wanted something a lot
more dramatic for an AO or dinner then I
just think this is legit that is
everything you guys I hope you liked it

pallet Norris regular was not sponsored

papers tutorials nice short sweet
