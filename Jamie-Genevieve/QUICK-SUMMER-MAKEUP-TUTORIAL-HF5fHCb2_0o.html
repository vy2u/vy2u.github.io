I am going to show you how to do this
entire look I said on Instagram that it
only took ten minutes which was la
because I just did it again and it took
a little bit longer so I think about 20
minutes and it'll look totally work that
I'm trying out some new products I'm
really excited about I'm showing you
guys how to get the body glow which is
my favorite thing for summertime I
absolutely love it if you'd like to see
her actually it does look stitching so
I've got a couple I know things to try
to be which I'm really excited about but
let's look at B on a look that I chose
let me just get her up like my perfect
summer makeup and it only took me I said
ten minutes on Instagram I think that
was maybe a wee bit of my life if I
could take another twenty minutes to
totally do it all but I'm just going to
get started show you serve and how easy
it is so the first thing I'm going to
try as a new product to me and it's
evildea snake blister oil
I just got packaged module to be and it
has foundations in it and a foundation
brush and yeah it is actually
interesting but I always wanted to use
this stuff I always wanted to try it so
it's going to take one two three
I'm clicking for the 53 and massage it
and your plate I probably want to rub my
skin but I like to push it and better
oh red there's that smell what's
animated oh my god then I smell it comes
in from lifestyle lake I think it's like
Magnolia or something I don't know it's
a complicated facial oil for expression
lines and wrinkles I don't want either
the source the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to prep my skin even
more I'm going to use my skin closed
cream you guys know that I love this
stuff so much and I'm also going to mix
into that the iconic one gen liquid or
women er oh this is a new color and the
shade glue so that not only with this be
really suitable for different skin tones
but I'm going to use it Mexico
moisturizer to get a wee bit of a pool
in my skin because are more tanned in my
body than my face so I'm going to mix 1
2 3 drop to that
and my fame King and it's going to make
me look super glue so I'm just making
out in the back of my hand
mmm nice
Oh bring that down my neck
leaking that and basically what this is
doing is is hydrating my skin and loving
me a nice girl and it's also bringing up
my channel a bit on my face before I put
my foundation on I like that parasite I
know the earth games is all prepared
we're going to go in with foundation
straight away and I'm really really
excited about this this is a new part
please stick foundation and it's books
that is like nutrition bar for your
feasts so I'm really excited about those
cominius the shade medium neutral I'm
going to play this like a with any
recommendation so I'm just going to
start drawing lines goes on really
easily and if you guys will follow me
for a little while you'll know how much
I loved heart I think that their makeup
is so highly performing I just think
that they're fantastic I love that I
don't need to worry about what I'm
putting on my skin and know that it's
good so I'm going to start off with this
much product and I'm just going to
beauty blend that in and one of the
reasons I love stick foundations is
because they are so quick to apply you
just draw them on and people in the man
there's no there's no faff in a bit you
get blended and really nice to actually
bring that down a little bit also happy
as soon as I heard that he's going to
bring out that condition I knew that was
going to be obsessed at 12 era where it
made up of the same component that the
Amazonian clay foundation through
default we see it our fill coverage is
vegan as well it's always the true if
you become the star it question
concentrated and it's well balanced so
north very smooth matte fight or hydrate
depending on your skin type
genius it looks beautiful it looks so
nice or and I'm so happy I love
that I love that color as well medium
neutral okay you know what I'm going to
do is I'm going to
a little bit of the tart sheet cape
underneath my eye I've not been using as
much lately
again this makeup is more first summer
so you don't need this much I spend a
little bit reads in some places because
I don't believe I will miss Morgan let's
just sooner and then is good people in
that and then I just kind of like to
pack that I build up that coverage this
is so great
obviously you guys know that I have
totally fall in love with in etosha
Jinora Foundation ahead far is really
beautiful and it does we're all day but
I'm closely on the hunt for the best
foundation in the world and then I'm
just going to use my friend goes just to
blend any ages I'm actually not doing
anything to my list to be nothing at all
not even priming them bases which can be
great but do Seuss or myself and they
want me to do is I'm going to grab my
pur cosmetics for in one place mineral
makeup that is the shade late time and
I'm just going to put our down right
underneath my eyes and that just sets
the concealer I'm also going to go save
my nose my chin my sources that
condition is glorious notice than that
I'm actually going to go ahead and
finish off the skin so I'm going to use
my morphe and fuller to brush with my
Mac giving me son bronzer and we're just
going to start get a little bit more
color into my cheeks bring that right
down my neck make sure it's in match n I
love a little bit of a forehead bronze
be seduced I think my favorite thing
about this look is it's just it's simple
but it just looks so pretty and it's all
very bronze glowing skin and there's not
much else to it apart from your red lips
and live shows so you still look super
put together but it takes it takes a
little time at all I think I look for
what really takes longest and people's
makeup I'm gonna go in with my Charlotte
Tilbury powder and
a brush made you guys know I love this
brush and I'm just going to start
carving out the cheekbones a little bit
and then when it's skipped a little laws
with a little touch of Bolognese are
just underneath my leg
then we pop in and use the Bahama Mama
bronzer I spoke about as a few times
it's just a really beautiful actually
bronze oh this great for just getting a
little bit more contour the nose and
then I'm just going to go over it one
more time with my and fortitude and
might give me Sun and I'm just going to
make sure that all super Blaine dies
next I'm going to do is I'm going to
start my highlighting so I'm going to go
in with my iconic illuminator and the
original shape long story short this is
the original shape I film up with you
guys know that I love this stuff and
then you brought out two more shades so
we've got a super po1 which is called
chain and then we've got this beautiful
bronze one called ghoul so they're
obviously tailored to different skin
types
I'm using them all day to show you how
you can use them so I already use the
darker one and with my moisturizer to
get that really gooey base and I'm going
to use the original one by itself onto
my cheekbones so you literally need two
drops on the back of your hand
and then I'm going to pick that up with
my dad's Beauty Blender just a little
touch and we're going to start gluing
this face up and then bringing that onto
my cheekbones and then up to my temples
and it's the most beautiful glow if you
do the by itself if you want but I'm
going to set it with a powder today so
once you've got that beautiful glow on
the cheekbones I'm going to take my
morphe r3 brush which is manipulating
brush and my melt gold or digitaldoc
highlighter and I'm going to shape that
and we do see the submit
and then I'm going to swap in a little
eyeshadow brush this is my semester
fairy I'm going to highlight my qubit
Bowl my little nose that's just the
length I want to learn tonight and then
again just get my bronzer and help them
not all playing together know that we're
going to spend all this place to do is
collect early mascara lashes nose and
lips so I'm going to do my growth really
quickly I'm going to use the next
Michael Gray pencil I absolutely love
the same that sim UN so my brows I'm
actually not going to do them to have
you today so I'm just going to brush
them through with a little spoolie and
then my new face thing to do okay a
little the so this is the Charlotte
Tilbury legendary blows but what I'm
going to do is I'm going to keep my
heart lifted mascara which is actually
like a really dark brown I'm going to
swap over because that brush is
obviously far too big I'm going to take
the tiny little brush from Charlotte
Tilbury pick up a little bit of this
product and I actually like brushing
that through my blows if you look it's
like Brett obviously to mascara so it
helps build up your blows but it's not
black until you see the difference and
then you can use this tiny little brush
to get those heroes at the front nice
and wispy and that you got nice slick
eyebrows and then if you have any little
canis paraphilias back when you go in
with your brave pencil and you dispel
them so I'm going to just bring them a
little bit further down at the front of
thing so I'm just going to do up here
just make sure that's nice and arched
and then I'm just making them a little
bit Curtis with the base just right
under here now we're going to do our
eyes and literally all I'm going to
literally my Maybelline false lashes
mascara and my Lily lashes can lashes
and that's honestly make you look like
your soul daughter up so I'm just going
to glue these lashes up and then well
and we append to dry that's what I'm
going to put mascara on so if I find
dead nasally I still have this wretched
cold in like a week we want something
urgently
oh my god now my lashes are drying I'm
going to mark out on and obviously the
top lashes I just need some nice and
black
I don't even too long because I'm
putting my falsies on so just one point
that I've stained but still so cute at
all you want to build those bottom
lashes up quite a bit let's go I've lost
the don't I'll probably go in and do my
bottom lashes again but it's time to put
the pulses are on so many is my little
tart lash tool act love these lashes I
think these are my favorites Taylor
lovely lashes now and I can honestly say
that I wore these probably like 20 times
mode and then why those I just place
them on give them a little around when
they're still wet and then I weep them
to dry pretty much entirely and then I
got some herbs a good squish squish are
you on near templates at so severe I'll
keep it here and I'll just show you what
I'm doing the lane I'm going to use is 7
1/4 from urban decay which is my
favorite red liner and then I'm actually
going to use my next soft matte lip
cream and the local which is one of my
favorite ladies of all times so I'm
going to lay my lips first
okay legacy usually when I rest my
finger on my chin when I'm doing
molecular my foundation comes off a
little bit and it's not done it they
come happy with that lip liner
we'll see you once I put this lipstick
on so I'm actually running out of this
because I use it so much but we'll try
Oh as the Bray earth nor can it can look
out quarterly Road I think I may be pink
I don't know I'm not really good just
colored toys I think it's maybe like
icarly Thank You red but it's so so
great
Oh makes your teeth look so white I am
summer summer kiss me gonna pop that
back let it dry down a little bit and
then I'll probably put a little bit more
on I need to powder a little bit more my
foundations like beautiful but it's
going quite like doing the middle only -
how do that down a little bit now that's
the last thing I'm going to do and
that's my favorite when I favorite
things to do in nice weather it's
obviously up girl oh I've got a little
strappy tarp on today so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take the iconic
eliminator and the shade chain which is
the layered but you'll understand why
I'm going to take a few drops of that on
the back of my hand I must say see for
pale skin that like perfect it's so
shiny it's just gorgeous
I'm going to take out my Beauty Blender
and I'm going to show you that build
shoulders and it's totally up to you
depending on what skin tone you have you
can use this one or you can use the
original which is a little bit more
golden e and then there's obviously
ghoul which is I really do fall bronze
what you call that collar board my
shoulder blue windows guru if you're
anything like my skin color you can use
the deeper eliminate earth if you like
what I'm doing here i'm just literally
putting that in between my two turns
okay i'm going to use a little bit of
the ghoul one ooh
and so called all you make sure you go
around your shoulders and then the last
thing I'm going to readjust the last
thing we'll match is taking my sink I'm
going to take my Mac give me Sun and
is going to do a Gentile bronze and then
underneath my color boys as well a
closing anything and then laughing I'm
going to do is say I'm a cut with the
cosign the all-night earth by urban
decay
I said my headstone okay I just don't
feel complete remote mom be quiet
obviously we're not read any eye makeup
but we can would highly earn in a corner
okay man finish so you guys that is be
finished look I really really hope you
like that and I'm a complete liar it
doesn't take ten minutes I think it
takes probably closer to twenty minutes
but it's worth it and also when you're
getting ready you're not having to talk
to anybody I just think that this look
is really really pretty for summer it's
long waiting obviously the foundation I
really really love it but I'm not giving
a good try it so we'll see how it lasts
through the D but looks beautiful and
natural and dewy and I really think I
like it I really actually do think alike
yet a lot of sex foundation so yeah I
hope you guys like this look and I'll
see you in the next tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
