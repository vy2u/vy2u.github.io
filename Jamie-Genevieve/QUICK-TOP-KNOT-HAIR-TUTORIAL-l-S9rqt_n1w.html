going to show you how to fix your hair
I got a little hair tutorial here so you
guys really sit which is really nice
cause you thank you very much for
enjoying it
I've been doing my hair and a certain
way it's like a little top knot but you
guys just wanted to see if to land it so
I thought I would do that for you so
it's like a first or I got no here by
the way
woo me since my hair is nice and I've
got my exchange and cut so they're like
just just added estimator suppose I got
it done today cool and washed it sense
or we're working with completely dirtier
here my favorite type of hairs
I've got my middle part and down here I
go Oh Pierson's
almost cute oh is that my hair doesn't
radar see the moment back hurry up I'm
quite like Natalie and I thing we do and
I'm going to take these beds at the
strength and will sweep them round so I
saw this here or Pinterest and I know
it's just like a thorn or a river but I
just thought it was really great neat -
the key is to get the frontal parts of
your here keep the part and to keep the
metal part in I'm going to actually take
a couple of extensions up as well
and then once you've got a little bunch
of here it's not that sex hole it's just
a kanay little bun and I'm actually
going to live local political very cool
thank goodness me because we've got that
make sure you don't have too much in the
back you go out all that volume so
Wesley just the front part and we're
tight up in a bubble and now we're
painting it up so what you're left with
is a little mobile part and you can I
oughta graduate that if you want turns
peel it to the face and a little time to
your little penis for a moment next
thing where's my bloody brunch
next I have to get a background grass
this edge from Sally's Salon Services
mini late care in a back home in
Brussels do it I know that this Hill is
eat eat London P Mike or even go ahead
and gluten I can add some foul and
please and get some I know that the GHD
one is actually really good as well and
what we're going to do is really put it
back home the little stroke a little
peanut sauce not too much but just
enough so it kind of gathers a bit more
and all the hair kind of sees together
do you see and then only next are some
bobby pins are available to Kirby's
Carly clips and we're going to get this
or ponytail give it a little tighten
again we're just going to sweep it round
so we just turned that a little circle
and the key like I do means for me I
kind of like to live that as you just
get your car boot and you just secured
it around or seem a little cartons go
and find plate to make that happen again
you know yeah I guess and then secured
it again and I don't care all right
around making sure all the little this
here's a secured eyes I'm actually
currently that's a little bit and here
so the Parton states you can carefully
but those eaten a bit looser so funny a
bit in like five years came we'll all
look back and be like what we're
rethinking putting a tiny little button
on the top of our head but you know what
it's like I just follow the chains when
they happen so at this moment so I'm
going to click button go a little douche
I'm a better person because I have to go
out seven Kobe's and that's all they're
do but it didn't mean it's going to last
and it was going to kirby that bit the
back as well and then once it's done
that part I don't like to use spray
because I would do that one day and an
in a stalemate I have one here don't
ride heat from I here to be like stock
like this so I just like to get my real
here on top of my extension and give
them a little tease to show you the
roots get that volume and that's it so
easy easy peasy lemon squeezy
and I think is really quite cute I just
got a little bit more volume as well to
see them
you say got volume you're back so I got
a little book and obviously if you've
got extension that I didn't write I got
many sales at the hairdresser tool it's
just like list we've done one but and he
just used the excuse to coalesce I
personally prefer the battles home if
you guys want to see me struggle with
that and probably burn myself and let me
northern look but I'm not actually
styled escalating so here yep I think
it's going to be pretty easy compared to
my super long extensions so that is like
quickest to ever want her to get the
little book or the top of your head
that's everything guys I hope you like
this super quick here trick if you even
call it that other than that I will see
you next came by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
