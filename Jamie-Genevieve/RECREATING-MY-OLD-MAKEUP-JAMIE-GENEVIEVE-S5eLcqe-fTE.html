I am going to show you how I created
this look button being a little bit
sneaky I did not come up with this loot
today how would I looked through my
Instagram I remember doing this specific
makeup lip which is right here and look
that I did and March 2015 it was almost
two and a half years ago it was actually
where my first load to get reposted by a
red makeup account so I was looking at
it and now I'm like it's not that good
so I thought I would really set using my
kind of tips and techniques that I have
now and plus I have know I've got a few
presentations here so it's just going to
be a normal makeup tutorial but with a
little twist as you guys like to see how
I created this look for them please
digit hello I'm going to show you how to
the bail to be specific I'm going to
show you how I created best look right
here I significantly remember the slope
because it was one of the first that
gotta be posted on our bigger code and
it was on the 16th of March 2015
so that most lens was about two and a
half years ago so I'm going to recreate
this look using new techniques new
products and I'm basically just going to
do it better than I did back then I will
zoom you in and we're going to do this
to this water first thing I'm going to
do and I'm going to press there
prepare my eyes and I'm going to use
limo paint pot by Mac I'm going to just
put that oil all over my legs with my
Beauty Blender right up to the brow bone
and the reasoning is a beautiful guys I
just think it's really quick music e I
was gonna pop underneath my eyes well
the part that I've used is a new palette
this is the pur sweaty deities palette
and I got it today actually I just
quoted today and I just thought it looks
really nice nice colors it may pass
again it's like marble and you can see
yeah it simply and it's gotten aids
better on a top one of the good matters
as well so yeah I thought I would like
to use it and actually really gorgeous
and it
really easy to use as well so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take the shade of private part case just
here and I'm going to look that up on my
brush I'm just going to apply that all
over my lid
Windemere a little bit I do feel a
little bit to Costa Rica Mary okay and
I'm going to swap my brush and I'm going
to take the shade splurge just here it's
a really lovely transition shape on my
semester 232 and it's going to start
building up in the piece and you can
just use eggs like normal blacks about
strokes building up felt bits at a time
I'm just dabbing into the product and
we're bringing it right into the crease
and I like to my brush on its side just
to start blending that out so I'm going
to go in with the shapes
Stunner just here which is a really
lovely warm blown and I'm going to start
building that up on the outer corner
onto the lid a little bit still using
this mess - see - and we start bringing
that into the crease then bring it that
right into the corner I'm going to start
to smoothen it and then under my eye I'm
just going to pack that on just hear the
cause I've started using the wipe again
just to clean it all up you don't need
to worry about what's going on down
there now that actually just blends
super easily I'm going to take the shade
socialite I'm just going to smooth that
going to vary a little bit so the clean
brush tip is going to make sure that all
blends nicely now I'm going to take a
dish aide snazzy and I'm going to push
that on on an outer corner and I'm just
using my we bought it to to forth to
place that product on and then blend and
then swap them back to my brush with the
warm blown and just using that to blend
it
although eyelashes fell off my brush
shows skin I'm going to go in with my
Sigma e-40 brush this is a really nice
tapered blending brush I'm able to shade
epic just here darkest color and I'm
just going to put that under my lash
line actually I'm not using that brush
winning in my zoeva to zero
instead which is just a little friend
brush I am also going to go on top with
the shoots nosy sort of leave it more
properly now will I've got this brush
I'm actually going to go in the snazzy
and win it push it on our coroner and
we're deployments my brush that I used
to put a first sheet down and we'll go
back and with that one and a little bit
of mobile I'm just going to Pat that
onto my legs to make sure essence
properly in that message of it may see
just nodes but do not crit so the only
thing that concerns me about this color
is that there's no black eye shadow and
there's no late shimmer the latest rim
right this one here and as George is
really really really pretty but it is
not light enough for another coroner my
hands that are absolute movement I'm not
worried about the Fox I'm going to tell
you all that up in a bit I'm going to go
in with the melt cosmetics dark master
eyeshadow it's my favorite black
eyeshadow at the moment and I'm going to
use that on the little Sigma brush that
e47 best shadow I'm just going to place
it where I want and I'm going to blend
it later because it's very pigmented and
I'm going to bring that underneath my
eye a little bit just mostly on that era
corner that's going to stun oh the nice
warm shade and I'm just going to render
up these shadows we really nicely but it
does take a little bit going backwards
and forward before we clean up I'm going
to put my liner on so on the top I'm
going to use my next epic ink liner
which is my favorite liquid liner and
then I'm actually going to use the
heartiest julienned into this does have
a liquid liner on it which I do like but
I prefer the next one but this has a
really good coal pencil that I really
like that I'm going to use I'm going to
do that first and this is liquid liner
so I'm just going to tightline my eye
and you can see her black that
tightly-knit right into that our coroner
and then I'm just going to do that
little opera bet that means my eyes
water like who's little I'm also going
to drag that cool down a little bit just
onto my lashline and I stop super
EXTREME it just works the streets away
and then we blend that cool pencil you
can see how much smoke hair and darker
that is much better now I'm going to do
my liner and I'm just going to do it to
the end of my eye so it's super easy and
then to blend that in I'm just going to
go in with the little Sigma brush and a
black eyeshadow again and you just blend
the very end of the liner away a black
eye shadow now before we clean up I'm
going to use my Becca opal and my shader
brush from dosis colors to highlight my
browbone and I did a straight heavenly
finished look
because it also helps blend up here so
I've done everything and then because I
wanted to enter corner to put a little
bit more I'm going to use my Laura
Geller gilded honey
and there's well and that just makes it
totally pop pop and now it's a very
satisfying part of cleaning it up and I
just look in a matter and lickable my
and I'm just going to follow if you
don't have nails like me to get a nice
clean line you can use like the coroner
all excited card or a like your tweezers
you can put your tweezers on your whites
and use that as an a straight edge but
if you've got nails it's really easy you
just clean up all right up I'm gonna
finish my I know and my brows and see if
it's even too until I've done that
so the lashes I'm using are the Lily
lashes and the style
Nicanor so just think of these at em and
glue them up and agree to a quantity
Rimmel scandaleyes you order this is a
really good mascara if you just once
thick black eyelashes nice and quickly
so I'm just going to talk about on it's
got a nice chunky brush and it's one of
those formulas it's kind of clump here
so you can really build up your life
now I'm just going to go end with a
little bit of benefit roller lash just
on top to make sure the lashes are all
separated and this just helps kind of
lock in the product because the ruler
large really democra
while I'm waiting for the mascara and
lash dry I'm going to quickly do my
eyebrows now the petrovac showed you
before I had actually shaved off half my
eyebrows because the photos was a good
idea so I can draw them on super high
and have the fierceness and the realness
of a drag queen and I did but I was
lucky enough that my Matilda my Rose
they'd grow back I think some people may
have tried the same technique ever grows
never really grew back Widodo again it
probably not just because I feel like
I've learned try to sell my brows and
properly for me so I'm just going to use
my Braille rose and medium brown and I'm
just going to sell in till the glow Moss
please make sure you get that nice sharp
line underneath and I like to just Sun
the front part as well just through my
blows are the more sparse and if you
feel that you use too much close-ups you
just use this Billy which breaks up a
little bit and then I'm going to use my
coach Europe blow by writer fail I
actually really like this stuff is just
like eyebrow mascara it's pretty solid
you can build it right up as well like a
mascara and makes your goes with nice
and thick and it's also got an a strong
color feel so it actually does look like
your tentative Rose once your larger
Jodie you just pop on from the outer
corner and the next thing that I did was
I got my shape tape and this shade time
fan which is the other boats my skin
color ain't no so actually is well with
our foe but I'm trying to can leave if
you haven't heard the brush I like to
use for that is the concealer brush from
daughter colors it's a really good brush
and I just pick up some of that
concealer and we're just going to
sharpen up the eyeshadow then going to
browse well so I start right here and
then I just drag that concealer dode
and then what you can do is you can kind
of bring the lane down from the top of
the road to meet the one and that just
gives you that tall sharp animal edge I
guess I'm just going to blend that
concealer and - must get a little bit
and it looks very clearly saying but
once you get your friend a tional and it
totally completes the look
now I'm going to zoom you out above the
brow I actually like to go in with my
brow pencil and just make sure there's
no gap for you can see my skin now I'm
going to finish my skin I'm going to
treat my defects pre know this is a
quick fix
how did you charge construction plans
blew from over the gates
I've got coconut water in it we're just
going to exfoliate fix my skin I'm going
to be my new tenant all in coconut
tanning most to be honest you don't
really need both of those but I would
always pick the time and one hemisphere
in the day I would definitely put my
heliotrope Eck SPF on by compass but it
actually make time I'm going to go to
the gym so I'm just putting my makeup
off so I'm just going to put my type s
antioxidant do see you don't
this is just what amount with favorite
things and then the skin routine it's
really beautiful it's super hydrate and
it just makes my foundation worn really
nice or the do unis and then I wouldn't
kick mold face felt heels
dearly divided in concentrate I'll still
use this everyday I use a lot of
skincare DNA I do have a new video on it

as the next total control foundation

entire world so I'm going to use the

going to be enough Palacios try it and
I'm going to use Matt see that new brush

concealer already are in my eyebrows and
my eyes I don't even interval close to

breezes it's not too jewy but it's
definitely not too much either is like

going to go about a shape tape just
right at the center of my face to make
sure to blend scaler just here I'm just

paper initiative and I'm just going to

was bring it down my neck a little bit
and my little boy
err all the usual thoughts and I'm just
using my Charlotte company blush brush
and we take my scopes and go brush from
shirt till they also and I'm just going
to use this product set slightly contour
I'm just kind of building up the product
just rate the contours like what other
bronzer can you put that much one in
still see a goal for the skin Germans
are safe I'm actually going to go in
with the Kat Von D shade and light
palette and let a medal contour colors
are directly related and we just pile up
to do it holes on my non-existent shoot
was cool
actually I'm going to use that same
shader and when it slightly contour my
nose to highlight my face I'm going to
use my bare coral pal the one she loves
I'm just going to use my tiny Allah a
lot powder fusion brush the same brush I
used powder under my eyes will don't
seem to fit the same type of brush I
will use that at the very highest spot
just to highlight right there I've
noticed since I started looking after my
skin a little bit more and my highlight
is cause I'm so much there it must be
the world recognized in mastering so my
struggles okay Lisa ten - north and with
my pit bull as well okay I'm going to go
off and find all upset cuz I don't know
what when I'm going to use and I'm going
to be right back an idea I got this
today look and see well open then look
at this Oh measly and it sent me a huge
big thing of lip product and I just
think I might try some condition for
this color and if everyone so I'm going
to lay my lips first with next suede
matte lip liner and the shade up offer
and then I'm going to use Midlands
number eight eight five
lipstick and the shade midnight marelul
is going to be nice so I usually just
rub off any excess or wants to come off
okay let's have a look and see what this
looks like
so it's Maybelline it five Mezen eight
merrill and it says bold on it so they
must have connect different textures but
I'm gonna try this
whoa good segment squeals nice I like
that a lot
I'm going to do my usual starting a
winner path and with my friend Gary even
though it's dark
let's go to old my Pearson ah okay I'm
going to go back in a fella Plano and
just meeting up any ages but it does
look really good just good thankfully
our there's a little is it well won't it
major - it in some Orbison is my
lipsticks a little bit darker and it's
not glossy so I want to make it glossy I
think what I might do and then we'll
take some skinny depth ivory and put on
the back of my hand first I'm not really
get this applicator on this but it
smells so good distance I'm gonna give
it my finger that did not work yeah it
worked a little bit but all relative
corner okay quit like that I'm going to
try out a little badges normal voice oh
yeah I'm just going to put some of this
gloss on top this is the Maybelline
vivid hot lacquer and the shades
obsessed I can dig it I like that a lot
I'd never do glossy lips but applicator
is going to develop like how weird
dorset - shiny okay now I feel I feel
like that fool
there's just dashing straight I wasn't
here acting and I've got my videos I've
got my video in correct position as
measured by what should be going it's
sure the world messy okay and then whoo
so you guys that is me finish the look
I'll show you again so that is the
picture I look a lot paler in a woman
video and this is my recreation I am
sitting on face like that be honest
I obviously prefer this look because I'm
not a child that's a two and a half
years ago my brother's gone back my I
title is more blended yes things are
just a bit there to be honest so yes
this is the look let me know if you like
this idea I am more than happy to
recreate some more bollocks if you
wanted I know I used to play around this
a little more colors and things like
that the reason I think this book is
because I don't actually have any like I
will have that many makeup tutorials
