I am getting ready for the Scottish
BAFTAs because I was nominated for best
youtuber in the world that completely I
was invited by MAC Cosmetics they
invited me and Jack to go to the
Scottish BAFTAs I'm really excited I'd
yeah I basically needed to get ready I
did not do my hair but my hair is V cute
I went to Maine like this morning Jack
back sort of man here he is my
hairdresser other than that all I had to
do was really do my makeup and then I'm
gonna stick my dress on when we get to
our hotel so if you would like to see
how I created this Phil makeup look then
please keep watching hey now all right I
need to make my friend Jack Lord but I
don't know how to do that for damaging
over here we were just talking more
years so the first thing I want to do is
my skin care as pet always and I'm going
to take my Chi press antioxidant
dewdrops this is really nearly finished
I'm just gonna take a little bit in my
hand we're just gonna push that into the
skin my hands are freezing
so they were operative then I'm gonna
take my new old photography fluids and
opacity to a percent I still don't
really know what that means I'm gonna
take some of that and this is the stuff
that I went crazy for it gets you the
most lovely glow of the skin it looks
unreal and falls as well which is
obviously important for me tonight
so I'm just gonna put that on all over
my face it does look quite bright but as
soon as you start kind of math sizing
that into the skin it just settle then
and it gives you a really nice glow I've
got a couple of little blemishes my head
I really need to get rid of ESCP next
thing I'm gonna do is take my Kiehl's
daily drive-in concentrate I just got a
new one of these very exciting I'm gonna
take 1 to 5 drops of that again rub it
into my hands and then Pat that on top I
want my skin to look super glue and
beautiful next I'm going to take my
hidden Beauty complexion perfection
primer their stuff is super set in
primer as well which is
actually what I need I think this is
what makes the foundation so mad because
the foundation wouldn't used to be as
the hood of beauty I absolutely love it
I tweeted saying that there's a good
chance that I will use that stuff on my
wedding day because it just looked
flawless it weird so nicely I can really
imagine it we didn't really nicely in
the heat as well by my skin it just
seems to go on like an absolute dream
the only thing I would say is it's the
primer underneath it that makes it
really matte so I'm gonna just apply
this to my kind of more center areas
because I put the foundation on by
itself it's no preferred the primer and
it wasn't as matte it wore a little bit
more dewy which I like still but for an
event I can't do want to have that but
that a little bit more matte I don't
want to look Shane you in any fours
no max canons all correct I'm going to
go in with my little beauty foundation
in the shade guys let just 320g and I'm
gonna take one pump of that first and
I'm actually going to apply it with this
tart brush this is part of the turret
Holiday Collection and I love it it's
really nice and like domed but you'll
see this rendition go and it's just like
what's it the best thing ever I have not
done makeup for an actual event and
absolutely ages but I'm really excited
so I'm just apply a nice like usual
another reason that like a foundation is
because it does photograph really
beautifully obviously because I'm going
to have been I'm going to make sure that
this matches my neck bring it right down
and another reason I like this
foundation obviously as it because the
coverage on it's really great it's gonna
cover up any of my Reds marks on my head
I've had a wee bit break now recently on
my forehead cuz I'm a lady
make sure it's blended into your
hairline so lately I've been doing my
foundation actually for the last ages
I've been doing my foundation first when
I'm actually gonna I just like her it
gives me more of an idea of what I want
to do with my face what is immune just a
wee bit
okay I'm gonna start concealing under my
eyes cuz I'm looking pretty tired today
so I'm just using the shapes hate
underneath my eyes and then I'm gonna go
up just so it's gonna stand before hit
I've got a couple of little blemishes up
here so I'm just gonna cover them up as
well and then I'm gonna go on my life
I'm going to use this as a base my eye
shadow never went by that um yeah we go
house looking hella tired all you guys
made fun of me for this sponge and say
like a butt plug that's all not PG you
guys okay so next I'm gonna powder my
eyes I recently just got the splott
encoder and the she delayed from Kat Von
D and I really late chefs I'm gonna use
this to mattify it underneath my eyes
and then on top of my legs as well
because that's where we're gonna be
doing her eye shadow and then I'm just
gonna go and push it into my smile lanes
and my chin as well always silly that's
Foundation there's a little bit more
matte so we're getting less shine off my
face and general which is good and I
will just do the center of the forehead
okay so to bronze my face up
I'm gonna use my Mac it gives me some
bronzer and my morphe in photo to the
big fluffy one and I'm just gonna gently
start to warm up my whole face and I'm
gonna try and be careful because I know
I go home with a bronzer and I really
don't want that to show up on any
cameras today I will be modified so I
mean later with the bronze I'm just kind
of doing our general warmup of the skin
I want to look fun cast but not super
sculpted I need to really brightens up
my neck now the blush I'm going to use
is Mac Swiss chocolate this looks super
dark but when you use it just a little
bit with a kind of more concentrated
brush it gives a really nice kind of
contour blush so I'm gonna do that next
is they're really nice awesome blush
this and then I'm just gonna go over
that with the bronzer make sure it ties
in I know I said I'm gonna be careful
with the contour but it doesn't mean I'm
not gonna contour if you know what I
mean
so I've got this little tart taste to
gold palette and inside its got two
highlighters and a quarter there's
contour shades amazing somebody is that
with my Smith one one eight brush and
I'm just gonna get the contour just
right at the back and then just doing
the size of my nose as well and we'll
make sure that super blended out
any crazy lanes if you feel like you've
gone a little bit too far down with your
blonde so you just get a little bit
Paizo you can just take it up like that
now I'm going to add my highlight just
to see if we were at with the skin and
I'm gonna take my 1 3 4 brush from zoeva
and my lord I Gaylord gelded honey I
really like this stuff I've been using
it at a time and we're just gonna
highlight it now I'm being careful with
s as well because there may be flash
photography I'm gonna just place the
highlight right on a cheap or nothing
too close to the center of my face and
then I love to do it above the brow but
cause my base is so mad I need to add a
little bit of glue eNOS to my skin so
I'm just Kiley and above the arch of my
brow that's why I can't like doing my
brows last these days because I do put
highlight or through them almost and now
we're gonna highlight my nose the bridge
of my nose as well make sure you don't
go too chunky with that and then and
then wail about it I'm just gonna
highlight my browbone to meet with my
cheekbones just so it's kind of like
that C shape we're looking okay I'm
gonna do my eyes now and palette videos
is the morphe 15 d
absolutely love this I think
I've used individual ready I'm not sure
but I'm gonna zoom you in
I'm not going to occlusion at all I'm
keeping it pretty natural so I'm
actually gonna start off with this shade
here in the palette called natural and
we're gonna build up the crease and I'm
just using my morphe e to seven brush
which I really like it's super fluffy
and because my base is all nice and
matte fight then it's just going on like
her dream building that up theme color
over and over until we start to get this
nice plane I'm bringing the shylock
pretty high I'm just keeping a crepe
soft color wise because I don't want to
be too overwhelming tonight I want my
eyes I wanted
like you know like pretty tonight no I'm
gonna go in with these shades editor
which is just in the middle it's a
slightly it's our warmer Brown and we're
gonna do the same thing we're just gonna
go in the crease and basically what I'm
going for to me as I just want to give
the illusion of bigger eyes more defined
eyes but nothing too dark and too crazy
that's my favorite can I red carpet look
is just when it's soft by the faint or
did I come up with a new red carpet I
would say it's but I'm bloody nervous
what if I fall over I can almost
guarantee if anyone Falls to me it's
gonna be me okay and then if you need to
remember and you can go back in with
your bigger fluffier brush and just buff
that out we just want everything to be
super soft but really really well
blended now I'm going to go in with the
darkest shades I'm going to use which is
define which is just here and then I'm
going to go in with a little bit of
epoch which is more of a kind of
brighten the other one's more of a kind
of like light kind of warmth and the
other ones more of a deeper brain we're
gonna go in with defining the first
color I showed you we're gonna start
adding the dark definition to fight you
know we're going to really pick these
colors appropriately and I'm bringing
that into the inner corner a little bit
just to get that smokiness you know what
like back in with my fluffy brush and
the transition shade color we're just
gonna buff that as well okay I think
it's pain to go underneath her eyeballs
so I'm gonna go in with this shade
define yeah and I'm gonna blend that
underneath my eyes okay I've got a
little bit full later there but because
my skin is really mad I can just brush
that away and then now I'm gonna get
that colored to Fane and I'm gonna just
place it on there a corner just so it's
more of a small a soft smokey eye but
you can see the difference in adding
that darkness here I just thought your
eyes looking unfinished
and then backhand her fluffier brush and
the transition shade and we're just
gonna buff that onto the lid now I'm
just kind of taking my time to build up
each eye individually make sure I'm
getting the depth that I want and then
always going in and then blending it
right
in with my fluffy morphe brush I'm just
slightly darken in the era corner what
I'm gonna do now is I'm going to apply
my lashes and mascara see how I look and
because this there's quite a light brown
smokey eye
I think the lashes are going to be
perfect no offense the last thing I'm
going to use are Lily lashes and at
least I'll can they're super soft and
fluffy
they're definitely one of my favorite
fails blush I'm gonna take these out and
glue them up for it mascara I'm going to
use the Tarte gifted mascara I've been
using this a lot recently it's really
really good I know I say that about a
lot of mascaras but I almost mean it I
love the scarran's so I'm gonna Chuck
that on and then with us if I really
want chunky bought lashes see already
that to me is much better with mascara
on like I like that much more notch then
my usual but I feel I feel more pretty
for eyebrows again I'm not doing too
dramatic today I'm going to use my
iconic London gray cushion in the shade
medium so it's a little bit later and
I'm just going to use it to literally
make my brows look a bit bigger but I'm
not gonna totally fill them in chunky or
anything like that so I'm just gonna use
my Anastasio at number fourteen brush
and the late sides from the medium
location and I'm gonna fill in the front
a little bit didn't see that just looks
much more defined without much product
and then I'm going to do the same thing
to the arch of my brow
and I'm just going to define the arch a
little bit - I'm happy with thoughts now
I'm going to go through my brows with
the glassy air boy gray so I'm really
excited with this product bloody look
I'm not talked about it before I don't
know why but I really really like it so
I'm just gonna go through my brows with
this and let's just make sure here is
like super chunky it adds a little bit
of a tent to your brows as well but what
I love about it is the really small
brush I can get right in at the front
and I'm gonna make the front of my brows
stand up and the only thing I would say
is you need to make sure that your brows
are nice and trimmed and also make sure
you get rid of the excess product
through the length of the blow before
you go in to the front because you do
get quite a lot product or natural brush
and there we have a brow so we're
looking a lot more human and we're going
to do a lip snakes or that let convoy we
use I used to loo this is Reedy every
single day when I worked on Kona and
when I worked as a freelance makeup
artist I did wear Mac space and Mac
honey laws ever you've really so I'm
really excited I'm gonna do this little
comb again so first we're gonna laner
lips okay we are lined and then I'm
gonna use honey love on top
I know it to Adam a little freckle I'm
going to use my little Marc Jacobs
liquid liner and then II pins celebrate
pencil from the bro bar just to make it
a little bit more Brown and not black so
just apply the black first and then go
on top of this braid this is really
annoying I'm gonna change my lipstick to
pink I'm just gonna blot that down I'm
gonna use Mac Yash instead and then I'm
just adding a little bit more of that
darker brown eyeshadow just to make sure
we're all blended so this is a close up
of the makeup a chef super flawless skin
love that foundation honestly I'm a
women obsessed and then I really can a
soft glam eye and then my usual nude lip
but using an old C's honestly honey love
it is beautiful but I decided to go
Froyo on this occasion just because it's
a little bit more rarely business and
that's just flashes home feelin today so
you guys that is the finished look I
hope you liked it and now all I have to
do is put my dress on if you wanted to
see what my dress is like then you can
