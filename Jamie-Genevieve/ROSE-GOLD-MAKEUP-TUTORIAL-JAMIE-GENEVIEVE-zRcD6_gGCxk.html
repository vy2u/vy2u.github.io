we are gonna do an old-fashioned makeup
to on this look I wanted to create
something a little bit more festive a
little bit more kind of fill on glam
then I have done lately I was looking
through my uploads and apart from vlogs
loads of the makeup I've been doing
recently it's a little bit more toned
down love it laid back there was a time
to Twitter called the red carpet look
even that for me was pretty like dialed
back dialed back died old fat dial
dialed yeah you know what I mean I just
like to create something fine and
sparkly and a little bit grungy and a
little bit cool if you'd like to see how
I created this look then please stay
tuned
hey drew okay so I've done part of this
I already just because I wanted to know
roughly what I was going to end up doing
and first I'm going to do is get my
shape tip from Tarte and this is the
shade medium I'm a little bit paler and
I usually am so I'm just gonna use this
people ask me a lot of Italy and multi
import from Mac I still absolutely love
it I just ran out and I kind of remember
the last time I was near a Mac store so
hopefully I'll get it again I did miss
it it is my all-time faves little ever
so I'm just gonna pop that base on all
really normal next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to take my Kat Von D locket
powder and the she'd late I really like
this I've been using it pretty much
actually I have been using it every
single day since I got it and I really
like it I think my under eyes and my
lids does not move so once that's all
patted down we're gonna go into a
palette and this is the who w/e desert
dust palette I think it's actually
gorgeous
I actually really do think it's
beautiful I actually haven't used my own
one that much but I bought all my
friends when I went away and I lost some
we cut my friend Amy hide it yeah it's
gorgeous it's one I thought I'm gonna
use this first clip I'm gonna go in with
is desert sands which is this late one
right here and I'm just gonna do a
little all over make sure everything's
super powdered down and then the color
amounts are going to use
my transition shade is down here it's
called bullying and I'm gonna use my
Smith 2/3 to brush for this the way that
I blended this is a really small
circular motion rather than went away
from movements I'm just gonna call
straight on and then just circular
circular my brush
what isn't here in a little bit so I'm
just gonna use really small circular
movements just start blending and I've
been watching a whole bunch of youtube
this morning whenever I feel a bit stuck
or I don't know like maybe a little bit
unmotivated of that word I'll actually
just set and I'll watch YouTube for a
little while and see see what sparked my
interest but I was watching a video by
nikkietutorials and she did this
technique that she learned off the met
shell who is an amazing makeup artist
from Burning Man chest that I think but
he is actually do my makeup next week
I'm absolutely buzzing he is such a
talented makeup artists and she got this
little tip from him so I'm trying to and
it's literally they just let you place
your brush down and you use really small
circular movements little baby movements
and it just starts the blend and I try
it on this eye and I think that is
pretty stunning okay I think it's
beautiful it worked really really well
I think this can I technique would work
really well with color as well so you
never know maybe I'll flew it blue
smokey eye next week I'm just pleased my
but I've stayed and using really small
circular movements I'll do my usual
window wiper just to bring that into the
inner corner I'm just really try and
obviously this palette I think the
pigments are guard just really really
nice obviously it is just another warm
palette but it's beautiful I'm going to
swap over on my brush to a 230 brush
which is a little bit smaller and the
color I'm gonna go in with is saffron
which is down here and I'm gonna do the
exact same thing but I'm going to bring
it onto the lid a little bit and then
I'm gonna start to get right in that
crease and I'm just using the same
little baby circular movements and then
I like to go back in with my fluffy
brush and blues and I do actually
isolated em a little blade with my brush
normal I need to bring that into the
inner corner Beth it's crazy how you
using your brush in a different way does
really change the way the makeup goes on
I'm really really light why my light
there I'm using hardly any pressure at
all now I'm gonna go empathy shade it
and I'm gonna go just on the very outer
corner of my eye I'm just gonna start
building up that dark I think this is
the first moment I thought about the
pilot because I think that color could
be more pigmented but to be fair to have
built a lot of color up already maybe
it's just not sticking that trick though
it seems that worked really well I think
maybe it's the circular motions just
buff that brought it right in which
makes it under more intense for the
light I'm gonna take my next glitter
primer absolutely love this stuff use it
all the time and I'm gonna go on top of
that with this shade here cause more
this is like a face glitter really
impressed by that praise glitter in the
palette because it actually hasn't been
amazed yet but I'm gonna take my Mac 239
brush which is just a nice flat brush
and I'm gonna apply that all over to the
naked part of my legs which is just here
so I'm applying that straight on the
lathe I'm using my dabbing motions just
to start feathered in that out and then
with the way part of the brush I'm going
to go straight into Cosmo and that way
it picks up loads of the product and
then you to school straight on top of
the lid with that and because the brush
is still a little bit sticky the most of
the glitter sticks to the brush and then
you've got a lot better playtime and you
don't get as much follow as well I'm
just sticking that on so that it's a
overs a really really pretty
canna pinky Sun City glitter but to give
it a little bit more dimension and can I
change up the tone a little bit I'm
gonna use my Urban Decay hazy
metal glitter this one it's an Midnight
Cowboy it's my all-time favorite it's
all the salt oh I absolutely love it and
I'm just gonna go straight on top all
the glass out with this and then because
that itself is a little bit wet what you
can do is you can use your brush and
kind of Pat that and and move around a
little bit to really mix with other
glitter and then once that dries as
pretty sturdy you can see I did this one
a little bit before just as kind of
taste though it's gonna look and it is
pretty sturdy something else I quite
like to do is to lead off powder and
glitter so I'm gonna use a little bit of
the Nefertiti I don't know if I'm doing
that right Nefertiti and Sally are still
on the same brush and I'm just gonna
kind of slightly leer that up and then
go back and with a little bit of the
cause mold with her from the palette now
that that's on I can see that this sides
not quite dark enough so I'm just going
to build that up a little bit more and
then before I do my brows I'm going to
go in with my lord o gala gilded honey
I've been really liking this highly
elite Lee really much this is just a
little blank canvas because may takes
eat or eat brush just a really really
small kind of smudger brush and I'm
going to place this highlight underneath
my brow and in my inner corner now I I'm
gonna jump off camera and finish off my
eyebrows and then we'll be back to
finish off our balls so I went to go and
do my eyebrows and realize that I hate
doing my eyebrows before my foundation
name so we're not going to do that
through a stop in at this stage which is
pretty crazy and what isn't me back
enemy bit so I'm just stopping at this
stage just nope so we can do foundation
cause I actually prefer doing my
eyebrows after foundation just because I
feel you can get a much sharper
I don't need to worry about carving them
out it takes less time so first again
first thing we're going to do is spray
our face this is the u-turn and toll in
coconut tanning mortar this is my
favorite thing on your tan basically
what it is it smells like coconuts it's
a really refreshing it's three that's
got tired in it so basically it keeps
your skin looking Sun Coast basic that's
what I really struggle with in the
winter especially if my skin is pale I
end up looking just say so that helps me
keep a nice glow about my skin
the next thing I'm gonna use is my
all-time favorite is the kneeled
photography fluid or past the t12
percent which I have no learned the
opacity it's like opaqueness so it's
twelve percent which is twelve percent
solid color but you guys know I love
this I love using this underneath my
foundation I just think it makes me look
really glowy really healthy photography
it looks sick
and I do actually think it helps my
foundation stay on that little bit
longer but that might be a possible the
fact that I just love it and I think it
could probably cure world hunger you
know I just got faith in the product
that glow in your skin it's just
stunning
excuse the little really coats of God
we're healing we are healing at the
moment I hate to say it but I think the
huda beauty foundation has got a couple
of ingredients in it that really just
did not agree with my skin doesn't mean
I'll never use it again I probably will
or no one off ever had like an event or
something but forever deuce it's a
definite normal from me the moisturize
I'm going to use is this cee all from
Sunday Rayleigh this is a new product to
me but I've been using it maybe like for
a week now oh it smells like oranges as
beautiful it's really good for you see
if you live in like a really busy city
it's got loads of vitamin C in it and
it's it's a protect and a pure moisture
I so it's vitamin C and E antioxidant
but it is really good if you like and I
really polluted place it's good
taking your skin from the pollutants in
the air it's good for repairing your
skin it's good for glowing and
brightening and smoothing it does feel
quite tacky on my skin but I like that I
actually wake up moisturizer I can feel
see that I just think my skin looks tan
pains more healthy so the foundation
we're going to use today is the it
cosmetics CC plus screen I absolutely
love this this is in the shade medium
I've not used it in ages I'm gonna take
two pumps in the back of my hand and I'm
gonna one where my sponge
we are we are wait look at the size of
this thing that's absolute Matt says
excuse there is foundation order I'm not
gonna lie
okay so we're gonna put this on I'm
gonna dot it on first spelled that one
but I have to use this all the time and
then the only the only thing made me
stop using that as it has pretty bad
flashback I felt like no matter how much
powder or blinds that are used on top of
it and any flash photography my face is
just Hawaii is anything this for me is a
really good everyday thing because it's
also got SPF 50 in it it was great so
I'm just gonna blend that in but if you
guys remember I was like obsessed with
tea for Justine today we're it's just so
beautiful really good coverage but it's
not crazy and like I think he just looks
like my skin but better actually didn't
see that on the tube yes that's the
tagline your skin for better and then
for our coverage and for hating sins
we're gonna use the Tarte shape tape I'm
gonna cover up my / little forehead get
a little bit extra coverage on the nose
area top lip and then go under our eyes
as well and that is as you're gonna help
us tidy up that eye look somewhat this
is actually called the velvet sponge
it's by l-c cosmetics and I absolutely
love it because see this long point it's
so good for like getting rate and that I
paid it up the makeup maybe I'll try
that
cutting thing with powder to do with
this see what I mean oh good what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna take my Kat
Von D powder from earlier and this is a
nurse Smith brush this is the Smith 133
brush I apply this powder under my eye
and then I'm gonna put a little bit on
my smile lines chin and then just into
my eyebrows I'm actually gonna Pat it on
I don't really want to move any coverage
now what we're gonna do and we're going
to finish off our eyeballs someone's
moving I'm gonna finish my eyes off
there's a certain way that I like to do
my under eyes you may not like it you
might bloody love it and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go in with
blazing first which is just here at this
beautiful orange tone and we're just
gonna run that under our eyes and by
that
I'll let you just get my brush for BAM
it still looks man oppa give me give me
faith okay we're starting to look much
more complete now I'm going to take the
Smith to side city brush and a little
bit of this saffron color here and I'm
going to use the side of that brush just
to stamp that red color right and at my
lash thing now I've got some lashes here
I wouldn't yesterday these are the
little lashes and they still can these
are one of my favorite what do you guys
ask me every day port lashes my reeling
and I can almost guarantee this three
sales of eye lashes I wear they're all
from Lily lashes they are in the styles
Miami Mykonos and Karen those are the
three special lashes I like can are much
more kind of flirty and natural Mykonos
are really quick dense and shorter and
thicker and then Miami are probably the
most like extravagant of the three Miami
are really really swifty they're long
but they're flat today
I think Miami are probably my favorite
but I like the karna law as well and
then we can also good for like really
like dramatic lashes but those are the
three sales lashes I wear all the time
honestly that probably why some of you
may find that my looks looks quite
similar because I've been same lashes
every day every day I love them mascara
I'm going to use is gifted from Tarte
I've spoke about this and a couple of
video is now this is the only mascara
that lasted I'll fill personal training
session did not come off my face it does
not crumble down your face I think it's
my favorite mascara at the moment and
I've just got my lashes glued up and
waiting to dry so I'm gonna pop some
quarter this on I really like this I
look I think it's so pretty
unless mascara saw amazing for bought my
lashes it takes a little while you
cannot have to wait for the fresh court
to dry and then the second court level
where you see if you build it up you can
get them so thick and long and chunky I
just bloody excuse the Despero is darker
than this one I really need to go and
fix that a step okay let's get these
lashes on ah I love it okay so now my
eyes are finished I'm going to go off
camera and do my brows and I'll be right
back so we can finish this face we brow
ah putting a finger and concealer now we
have finished our eyes and our brows our
skin is looking a little bit new so
let's fix that the bronze that I'm going
to use as the Urban Decay Beach bronzer
in the shade bronze verde is our new
Smith 139 brush this is a really nice
dense thick domed brush and I'm sure
it's for powder
I'm sure to bend the pr leaflet with it
but I'm sure I saw sound use this for
powder so we're gonna do that and I'm
gonna get a little bit that bronze
aren't ready to start at the back and I
think I'm gonna do a not nude lip I
think so so I'm not gonna go hang with
this skin I'm gonna keep that pretty
natural I'm just gonna warm up in a
natural way
so I'm just bronze not my forehead
excuse my hair I really need to wash it
but I could never bothered and I'm gonna
pause it there and grab my heartiest
both ago and I'm gonna take this shade
here chisel and I'm gonna contour just a
little bit and I'm moved onto my Smith
one one eight brush just add a little
bit more dates at the back there do my
little nose corner that's like the
laziest nose contour in the world but it
blood it worked good so really convert
ones but we need to highlight nice I'm
going to go back in with my Laura Geller
gilded honey
News luxe powder fusion brush it from
and Saliba this is the one t4 brush it's
basically like a big eye shadow brush
but it is absolutely perfect for a
buffing I highlight into the skin it's
it's amazing so I'm gonna do that I'm
gonna bring it right on to the cheek
bone and then I'm gonna put a little
touch just in the foreheads to add that
Sheen to the skin I'm just gonna take a
little soft crease brush from zoeva
and get a little bit this highlight and
highlight my Cupid's bow the tip of my
nose and then the bridge
I'm gonna use a note but I'm not gonna
use a usual note I'm using a new nude so
I'm just sharpen up my pants so I'm
gonna use an urban decay lip liner these
are my favorite lip liners an entire
world I've finally decided I'm going to
line my lips with 1993 it's called which
is my birth year coincidence it's
amazing and gorgeous I think not so I'm
gonna lay in relax

gorgeous knit and I was really excited
with these products I actually totally
forgot I had these lipsticks oh yes that
