guys but mark my Channel today I'm going
to give a Sephora haul I set myself I
would use this finger so no one would
know but they are basically I was an LA
for two weeks
just go home ago and I was there for
Coachella it was amazing if you haven't
seen it yet I do have a couch a love log
wise and on Instagram you can see tons
of snacks from when I was an early and
blah blah blah but I went to Sephora as
usual for anyone who doesn't know we
don't have Sephora in the UK so it's
pretty big deal whenever we are in
America
whenever I am in America I always source
see I'm hidden again whenever I'm in
America
I always for Sephora and I always make a
point of going in and spending some doll
spending some money so that time I did
that exact same I have a mixture of
products here I have not much makeup you
would be surprised to hear but I do have
a few of my favorite things a few things
that I've not tried yet and now I'm just
going to jump into the video and show
you what about the first things I bought
where the Brazilian bonbon cream this
stuff is at me then if you go to Sephora
often you'll always see this at the
connect share code but my favorite part
of Sephora it's when you're walking to
the tail and then you have to walk
through that little oil that fill of
small goodies that are more reasonably
priced because that about the best size
but it's really easy to justify buying
with I got the filling bumbum cream I
actually have just ran out of my second
a little mini one I love using that I
love kicking it for traveling it smells
amazing it smells kind of tropical I
think you see passion through its
centered it's unbelievable and it
basically a called bonbon creams because
it has guarana extract in it which helps
tighten up your skin
so the idea as you use it on your butt
and I actually use making out on my bum
and man can have chest up here cut
everywhere apart from my arms my legs
and it just helps tighten up the skin it
smooths out your skin and it's really
fast absorbent but it smells incredible
like a log
clean this one after the shower and then
going to bed my sheets all smelly cat
and it's just really nice I know that I
love it so much they are actually ball
ah what kind of massive ones that are
turning four emails and it's just this
is the size I usually get and I just got
this size 4 in the house I flip him love
it the next one I have got here I
actually didn't buy but I wasn't me
internet was given I mentioned because I
got listened to for the first time I got
a little teeny little spritzer orbit and
and then I got left sighs orbital I
bought that size from Sephora
the last time I was in the States long
story short when I was with the
Coachella the colors a glass portal the
thickness of me and it was pretty much
fill it was a fill bottle of perfume and
it's not cheap I think it cost is
upwards of $100 anyway which sucks I've
had a lot of money for repairs in space
with your buy it for yourself which I
actually buy all have a few myself
yeah I don't wait for no man so
basically or taken off me I was super
upset can believe it an incredible form
these guys actually I wonder them Villa
brought lore'l and one of my friends
alone ales paired that Louis bet and she
sent me another one she got she got it
from me from the PR so I'm super happy
but basically the last sales and support
idead participant is the vanilla I can't
speak French so it's the intense vanilla
scent and I just love it it's like how
do i Cisco but it's quite like a
connector back or vanilla deep musk you
said it could be mistaken for a little
village gentlemen's lounge kind of smell
but I just love it
super deep at last edges on the skin and
at last ages I'm like a corpse and stuff
but you'll be put on a jacket is not
wearing a while you get a little of it I
love it and
if the type of person that people will
remember that it's used so people like
all that smells of Jamie and I don't
know why I just like that so I got this
from supporter last name so this is my
little replacement one then a couple of
things I got are my little sheet masks I
absolutely love sheet masks
I know the foreground is this again
someone said that torn or
too-cool-for-school is cold and this is
the egg cream mask and this is the
farming one we have like a few Justin
types of these masks I've tried the
farming the high tree and I don't know I
think I've tried them all by now but
they are really good they're not to
experience it at all
I love using them on plates I love using
them the next day yes I've been a
tonight before of Muskaan's crying for
help I just fold a sheet mask I think
that they're really fun really easy and
I do think that they really work one
thing I would say make sure and that's
how we would and if you any kind of oil
for example I love my Kiehl's daytime
and nighttime oils I would always put on
whatever oil underneath the mask and
that just helps whatever's in this mask
get right into your skin and get working
the next master go is from coruña donor
font in that rate and I'm not I have to
try this one before but I'm a sucker for
packaging I think that is the biggest
reason I bought any of the Hatcher
products and the pathogens beautiful
so I purchase you know so this is the
antioxidant face mask a cinema spewed
cloth masks with the same kind ideas of
sheet masks and yeah I just know what to
try to say I'm not trying to oh yet and
when I do I'll be sure to jump on
snapchat or Twitter and let you guys
know my sellers sheet masks for me can't
really go wrong unless we are super
fluffy and then basically that means is
just tons of glycerin in there and it's
not actually doing anything through your
skin so we'll see what this one for this
one does
I actually don't get the support of
unburned avocado I'm asked for ideas
Jack Jack kind of like an iMac he loves
the tart ones and yeah I give him that
first light warm so I don't have that
one neat but I highly recommend looking
at the support when Brad masks they are
super affordable and the
are actually really good we make that
about here as the cinema secret Pro
cosmetics brush cleaner and it is a
little travel case lesser than their the
a look do the little isle of time see
little miniature things and Fleur Fleur
de Forest actually picked us up and like
habit I guess
you need to try that this is the base
brush cleaner ever have a child yet no
come on buddy
where's this are cute so it comes with a
little tiny pen really sweet I think
idea is that you put the brush cleaner
in here and you give your brushes of
clean let's let's just try it why not
oh right okay first floor and the bottle
is amazing I like use let's go start
your brush so here and Monica brush and
we're just going to dip it in here go
after all about and then I'm gonna oh
okay look at that okay
 good color good cold so that's the
makeup brush cleaner and said on my
secret is I always of the blink
everything down below because I know a
lot of people can understand what I say
the next thing I have here as the
Tassajara fire resurfacing mask I got
told with this by Anna
so Anna the anima deck eek EE Viviana
does makeup guys like supporter most
absolutely bloody love it when a group
of like beauty gurus Gordo's because we
were to sell and stuff to each other I
actually spent the least amount of money
of everybody the charts are higher part
resurfacing mask for instant glue and a
spoke so highly this she says you put it
on
poor girl Wiggles it feels really nice
it smells quite spa quite like a spa it
smells like it would like I can smell
the resurfacing product wherever that is
a wee bit acidic anise melon but she
says that you put on all over you give
it a second and then you gently
exfoliate and I think it's really lately
exfoliating and then you you can event
it all but Takahara I which I'm pretty
excited about I'm not taking anything
from this brand yet so this will be
interesting
the boosters
hundred percent free from GMO toxins
cellars artificial colors artificial
fragrances and synthetic chemicals so I
love something it's most natural and
obviously with the all-natural a
preservatives and stuff in there but
yeah I'm really excited again follow me
on snapchat and I'll tell you how we get
on
No the next product I go up our hair
care products I'm just going to show you
them all together this first thing I
bought was the we dry shampoo phone
which I actually have used today and I
like it oh well that's well in my hair a
later because it's not dry or this is a
dry shampoo so when you get one you
don't get that page we finish and it
clear but it still give me nice texture
it doesn't take away all the texture my
here which I hate when you end up with
super sloppy here on top and then like
dirt here in the bottom you know the
next thing I picked up was the detox
request dry shampoos form if s is made
to be the kind of same thing I'm going
to try them both I have tried them both
I was Tyler Moore and then decide what
was my favorite but I hate washing my
hair so much so much that stuff like
that is really good for me I don't love
dry shampoos most of the time there's
none that I really tried as I called out
the best dry shampoo at her so happy to
try those out and then the other thing
for which have been used and already
which I've lost the care for the trouble
fix clean one texturizers
amplifies and refitted so it's almost
like a texture spray and a dry shampoo
and one and it works man it is funny I
wash my hair when I was in LA and when I
tried it was so fluffy and crazy that I
just put some of my hair oil through it
which I actually use the we here oil
stretch enemies and by the way look I'm
nearly running out I need to get need to
get water I use oil stir it has street
in my ear and then I put a little touch
of ester and it just give it that kind
of more messy matte texture that I
really like and my here like see the way
it can amaze it I'm done I'm not huge or
in here sailing so it suits me really
well and yeah I'm really really really
enjoying it the last product of culture
and the foundation that I have been
loving at the moment whenever the way I
got this foundation and the second day
of our trip and I would every single day
sense so I would it to katella always I
went for both weekend so I was there for
six seasons haul and we went to the
first of all about five we go there
about 4:30 5:00 p.m. stayed there until
a betrayal with my tank or the bus home
and every day I was doing my makeup
early because I'm still waking up
clearly and no joke vest stuff lasted
all day like when I take it off and it
was still pretty perfect all the photos
I got the first of all I was ended like
the Sun it was fair to eat degrees
during the day
and the desert so that foundation lasted
all that time at such light coverage it
still coverage but it's not Kiki I've
got it on right now if you if you're
wondering and I really really like it I
really like it when I hold must I was
being a little bit dry it was a little
bit drying trustee after the flight so
when I put it on the day after I go home
I wasn't sure it was kind of setting on
my dry skin and I was not loving it but
I gave my son a good exfoliation
yesterday I used two peels
microdermabrasion
exfoliator which is unreal I'll link
that down below as well basic fuller
I've ever tried my entire life I did
that yesterday they're not going to seem
to be and it's set in perfect game so I
was really looking after my skin when I
was a wee but when I got home I said
obviously I got charcoal but I'm feeling
a lot better nice and yeah I just think
it's amazing so without further ado the
foundation as the Natasha de Nonna
foundation X fill coverage foot complex
and the shade I use is 42 which is
actually called medium I would new out
here video and you can screen to a store
of any title at moment this is my color
this is my skin I caught a bit of the
Sun when I was a wee thank goodness that
Matt was me paper it's a little touch
warm but I just
Roza diamond eggs because my shoulders
are actually quite times when you look
at them consider my face the old can
match and quite nicely
Deb foundation fill your skin care put
your payroll in apply it with a beauty
blender you can love it and I actually
went so far to message QV because I know
that these thoughts Natasha did order
but they did not have this foundation I
met someone I was like hey where does it
when you get in it I need somewhere I
need to show people were together in the
UK because they're going to be mad if I
have fallen in love with a frenzy so you
can only get an America I asked love

when I was away and I'll be using this
foundation as you guys want to see an
action so guys that is my little
portable that says a little supporter
hole by the way this is small and always

little section this isn't a little
section and this is in the little
section actually sort of face mask

love doom you get a little free travel
