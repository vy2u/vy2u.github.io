I am going to show you how to create
this entire makeup look this is one of
the loops that I did when I was away for
New York Fashion Week
it is so simple and easy it's mostly
kind of skin focused but we've got this
bold lip which you are all very excited
to see from me I really really like
creating this look it is so simple and
easy and it's also really versatile you
can change out the web for a new clip if
you want it to be even more natural or
you can change it up for a read or
whatever it's a super easy look and it's
just good to have and your makeup look
Bank this video is sponsored by our
iconic London they challenged me to use
no other brushes but their brush there
and every super easy super easy and
approaches are gorgeous so I really hope
that you like the look a tree and if you
would like to see her and ed create it
then please stay tuned hello
let's just get into it I have already
done my skincare
I usually go through that and my videos
at the beginning about this one you know
what's short and sweet
gosh the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to pop on my primer this is
the fancy Beauty cruel filter soft matte
primer I really like this I usually just
take Wendy be pump on the back of my
hand and then I just kind of rub that
and to my center areas mostly when I use
this my foundation doesn't separate it
doesn't go to do it doesn't go to oily I
just really really like it and I also
like that it's like I can a creamy
texture that sticks into the skin it's
not true waxy or oily it just sinks
right into my skin and weeks for a
really good base so let's get into the
foundation know I've mentioned old lady
that iconic go and touch and basically
I'm going to use nothing but these
brushes so this is their brush set it
comes in a really really cute little bag
but taking all the brushes out taking up
them all over their little plastic
casing and I'm going to use just these
brushes to create my whole look which I
think will be super easy the brushes
don't actually have a name but I'll just
make sure to show you what they look
like before you use them so the
foundation
as the NARS natural radiant long wear
foundation this is the shade Stromboli
I'm about tanned right now so I'm not
sure if this is gonna be your Karen or
but I really love this foundation it's a
toss-up between this one and the wire
sale all IRA spending should those two I
just love them both so much this one's
definitely more luminous but I feel like
maybe the way I sell one maybe lasts
longer on my skin hmm I feel like I need
to get a few more colors all of it
because I don't think the colors that I
have eight they will match me so we're
going to use this one so taking a few
pumps of that in the back of my hand and
let's just use the biggest flatheads
foundation brush well color is gonna be
a thing ah this foundation is just the
best it covers everything out I just
love it this is good not absorb in any
product really so I feel like those
foundations may be nasty I've got
flippin spot on my head I don't know if
you guys watch the blogs but you'll have
seen what happens when I guess bought my
head put a plaster on it and played
Prosecco palm it's a good day I'm gonna
bring that foundation day when I go back
so much laughs in the back of my hand so
I'm just gonna build it up a little bit
more I think that he's not like that
says you can use just a little bit if
you want but if you want full coverage
you can really build it up and it's just
beautiful go right over my lips like
usual the reason that I do that is
because I just don't like the natural
color of my lips I think they're really
really pink you guys know that I love a
nude like I feel like going over them
the foundation just kind of blanks them
out so I can see what I'm doing with my
makeup properly okay I have so much
space in the back of my hand that brush
did a good job that was really quick on
to concealer I'm going to use my tart
shape tape in the shade tan color Spain
and I'm not going for anything to lay
underneath my eyes just no and I'm just
gonna use that to add a little bit more
coverage in my Santa videos and to cover
this bloody spot in my head I'm gonna
blend this in so this is my friend Asian
brush and then this is what I'm gonna
use for my concealer it's a little bit
smaller and it's got a little slant to
it as well so I feel like people
underneath my eye pretty well and just
can i patent the concealer and I'm not
moving it around too much and it's
pretty good very easy that looks perfect
and you'll notice that I've actually not
gone over my eyes at all because this
like my new fave thing to do is just in
my foundation concealer and just leave
my alleged space just totally free a
product makes everything look much more
natural as soon as i blank out the
natural colors in my lids I kind of need
to go back in with more eye shadow to
can it get the definition again but see
the natural coloring of my LEDs it makes
it look really complete anyway so fab
I'm gonna use this guy so I have so many
brushes like this and they're like that
weird flat contour type brush and I've
never used them but when I try using it
today and the product I'm gonna use to
contour as the hoola kwikki contour
stick by benefit I've had this for ages
and I've just not used that until I went
to the Maldives and it was there and my
friend Asian was just far too late for
me and I used this contour and add depth
into my skin and it was amazing so I'm
gonna use this just leave it more depth
let's try this and then if you've gone
to have which I always wanted to is go
in with your concealer or your
foundation brush just to tidy it up
I think that's really lovely though I
don't really powder my skin too much
anyway but if you do make sure that you
do this step before you head over cause
as soon as you start adding creams
powders skin it just turns into a bit of
a hot mess to be honest I just think
that it looks so pretty
really nice pretty scary so we've got
this little brush here I would be
tempted to use that for highlighting
also but when you use this first to
powder underneath my eyes and I'm going
to use my Charlotte Tilbury airbrush
flawless finish powder and sheet number
two I phoned you but I knew one of these
when I was cleaning out my makeup and
I'm so happy because this powder is
amazing I've been really liking my Kat
Von D one lately as well but this I've
used this for ages and ages and whenever
a runner or but I kind of feel like I
need to use something else just to like
try it out underneath my eyes just top
lip anywhere that you crease to like my
smile lines and then even long before
head can move because of all tops I like
to just powder here just to make sure
nothing gets
Shanee she flowers now to set my contour
because we use a cream product I'm gonna
go on top with my butter and bronzer by
Physicians Formula
you guys have been comment like crazy
seeing how much you love this stuff and
it doesn't look too dark but it just
gives the most beautiful natural bronze
ever it's beautiful
and then it some of you guys have been
saying that there's a darker color also
so I'm gonna pick that up next time I'm
in the States but winning is just this
contour brush from the kit from ICONic
and we're gonna bronze or face I just
flip head and I love it
I think it caused something like maybe
$12 $14 or really kind of amber but I
picked up at QV s CBS CBS I think that's
where you can pick Physicians Formula
that are Ulta Americans please comment
below and let us know I've got a really
bad memory
there is bringing that runs okay my neck
slightly and then I like to use this one
doing this a to my nose I don't know
it's just the most amazing texture I
can't believe I like it this much and it
smells great
it's a little bit quite perfumes if you
don't like that kind of thing but I
think it smells the museum I just think
that that skin that looks so good a
little spots connect please just pay I'm
just gonna leave my spot like that this
is the most natural bruinz corner I've
ever done put a powder underneath the
contour I've got my all nature pollution
protection spray I feel like this is new
but I am just going to use it like I
would use my own eye or and politia
protection you know that's an added
bonus yeah smells exact same which is
came - shame I don't love the way that
all met your smells but it's so good
that I just kind of get over it so I'm
gonna go ahead and just start
highlighting and product I've got four
that I'm really excited about so when I
was in New York for Fashion Week I was
there with Maybelline I got my hands on
the master chrome metallic highlighter
and the shade molten gold oh my god it's
beautiful so I'm going to use the powder
brush that I use for underneath my eyes
just to apply a little bit of this to
everywhere Lord you guys would ask in
what highlighted always using when I was
on my travels and it
this the same brush just apply a little
bit above the arch of my brow and spray
in my skin like that before applying it
really helps it can adhere to the skin
and just look super glowy no because I'm
not doing any actual eye makeup I'm
going to use the eye shadow brush this
is the fluffiest brush we've got from
this brush kit and as great and I could
definitely do how a whole eyelid with it
but I do prefer to have a full off
hairbrush maybe the same amount of
business but she's bigger like fluffier
just to get my base shadow worn but I
could definitely use this the other
brush for the eyes are these to put your
gray this brush looks fab for underneath
the eye I love smoking out underneath my
eyes that was great and then this little
guy here would be really good for
patting on shadow so you could
definitely get your eye look finished
with these brushes totally they've also
got a little pencil brush for liner and
E angled brush for brows that looks
really really nice only thing I would
say the fluffier brush and they say it
would be perfect and maybe a slightly
smaller version of this for highlighting
and it would be so happy
they've got this big fan brush which you
could use for highlighting but I just
like to be a little bit more precise
with we don't put highlighter cause I
used so much of it you know I made the
older school so I'm gonna use the little
eyeshadow brush and the same highlighter
from Maybelline to just head that bright
one and if you're looking at this
highlight you're thinking eyes to Goldie
from me I know that this girl the same
product it's more of a pinky tone that
you may like base right I'm actually
gonna go in with a little pencil brush
just to ten - noise and then I'm gonna
use just a little touch of that in the
inner corner and then Cupid's bow
this is late lovely but I like to have a
little bit more drama with my eyes and
without a eyes shadow I really need to
pay two lashes so we're going to use the
nerve bag alabang mascara from benefit
which I really really like I feel like I
have to powder my eyes quite a lot to
make sure that doesn't transfer those so
just bear that in mind when you're using
this if I'm wearing no makeup at all and
just mascara it's perfect but if
anything too
oily underneath the eye it seems to kind
of draw the black down and then you kind
of get that kind of black under here but
like my eyes powder properly it's
totally fine so I'm going to use this
and then we're going to use a pair of
the pure Pro eyelashes I just got these
in the post and I thought that these
look so similar to my mikonos lashes
which would be a really great cruelty
free alternative for you guys so we're
gonna find these and some mascara right
now get the lashes I blew them up
looking up and made the packet they seem
a little bit less dense than my usual
lashes but that's okay and then I'm
gonna try the pure rule eyelash glue
because it looked really similar to the
one that I always use I think as mascara
is probably go I know that people who
were kind of given a bad rap on his eyes
I stood anything that's got much to do
with the mascara itself I think that's
got more to do with the trip and maybe
people that weren't invited Donna and
just I think obviously there's more
Kenneth by training drama to people's
opinions rather than the mean opinions
solely based on the mascara if you're
passing benefit I know that the girls
are really really good at just chucking
it on you can can I try it out first see
how you like it but I really like that
really end I don't know what there is to
complain about really the under eye
thing is the only thing that I saw and
then of course it will get clumpy if you
keep on putting more and more layers on
you only really need one good layer okay
mascara zone I'm feeling way more human
than that that's five minutes ago and
then hopefully our lashes should be
great
so let's chuck these on and if these are
similar to Miko Austin or laughing they
look great feel it really nice those are
the lashes and train Center doesn't me I
am 11 for the natural row these days
especially with this look I think
because it is quite natural and soft
then having natural soft pros like it
can make sense so I'm gonna use the
benefit 3d rotones and this is in the
shade for and I'm just gonna brush this
through my brows and it's almost like a
brow gel with a little touch of color
but it also has some kind of reflective
properties to it which makes your brows
look thicker and adds a little touch of
color
too much and then what you can do when
she's done that as you can go in with
your bro pencil just you're gonna fill
in any areas that you need so I'm going
to use my precisely my gray pencil by
benefit as well and that the shade for
also oh this is brand new and just went
through all my makeup and I for honest
they got a bit a of these so I'm sorry
I'd for the rest of the year so I'm just
gonna add a little bit more dips just
down here at the front and I'm a holding
my pants all right at the back so it's
super light it's just like drawing
really then I'm gonna just accentuate my
arch a little bit I'm going to add my
little freckle just here this is just in
my extractor pin I really want to find
something that I like a lot more this
thing is a bit rubbish to be honest but
it gets the job done when I add my
little freckle here and I'm also going
to add one just down it here as well I
just feel like it kind of glows with the
look I'm gonna add my lipstick so this
is my kind of favorite part of this lip
the cause planer is away in New York I
also have found this highlighter by also
find that these lip products so these
are new super stay matte pink lip color
and fainter and I'm sure that they're
called unknit this is amazing this is so
good so I'm going to use the matte lip
liner and mahogany this is actually
patrick stars limited edition version of
it but I know that mahogany you can get
forever it's like a permanent lane so
I'm going to line my lips first so I'm
just gonna shove this lip color on as
sore pigmented as these quite sticky for
a little while but then it dries down
matte and honestly it just doesn't come
off it's so good and this smell homie is
in and then because the lip color is a
little bit different to the lip liner I
like to just use this cool little brush
you'll see it's got like a real point to
it so you like to use the brush just to
push the product up near the lip liner
and that you guys is the finished look
so it is so easy I can't believe how
many of you guys wanted to see this but
it obviously is striking enough because
you've got the cat art clip but it takes
no time at all this look is pear
for pretty much any occasion I will open
the last day of Fashion Week and it was
probably my most complimented makeup
look that I did through the whole thing
so thanks very much for that you guys
thank you so much to you guys for
watching this video and other than that
I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
