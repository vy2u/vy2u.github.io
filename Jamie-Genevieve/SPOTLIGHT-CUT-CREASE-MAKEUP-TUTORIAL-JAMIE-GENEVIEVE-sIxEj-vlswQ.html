i am bringing you this super super glam
look right now these can I make ups are
a huge trend again when I worked at
mascot ages ago when I first started my
channel isolated makeups like this all
the time and then we kind of went
through a phase where it was a little
bit more natural and then now it's
coming back thanks to people like meh
meh meh meh meh Chell and Stacy Murray
Avery who are both amazing amazing
makeup artists everyone seems to be back
on this hype so I thought you know I'd
join and join on that bus get on that
bandwagon do cookies for you guys so I
really hope you like this makeup look
and if you would like to see how I
created it then please stay tuned hello
hello hello I'm Jessie and if this works
cause I don't know I've never used it
before so first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna pop on my Chi press helio
tropic sunscreen and framer I have loved
this off the whole time like I got a
fresh one I actually really really
finished things as well so I'm just
gonna do this and then we're gonna rub
that head and when I use this I just
feel like my makeup really lasts
especially if I'm wearing quite a lot or
that it does actually work who's a
really nice primer and I'm really
excited to show you guys the skin on
today's look it worked really well I
wore it yesterday from about named iam
tell 10 p.m. and it was flawless all day
so once I drop don't I'm gonna go in
with my foundation I am back on the Born
This Way Foundation from Too Faced this
is the shade warm beige and I'm gonna
take one pump and then a wee bit I'm
just gonna use affected don't brush just
apply that all over I was pretty
obsessed with the way that my skin
looked and lasted all day yesterday it
worked really well
it was like a nice color and stuff it
just marched really nicely it covers up
everything you want it to it's just
great it's really good foundation it's
been on the market for ages I'm sure you
guys have tried it already and I've got
a little bit left in my hands
just gonna start building up put me a
bit more never going to move into
concealer if you've been a part of the
family for a while you'll know that I
used to use the Kevyn Aucoin
skin enhancer so much I used to use it
to cool down my eyebrows more sleep but
I got my real color so I've got SX
11 and I'm gonna conceal with it today
I'm actually gonna add some coverage I'm
going to use as an eyeshadow base I did
this yesterday oh my god was amazing I'm
gonna go straight in with my foundation
brush to pick up a little bit at a time
and I'm just gonna Pat that underneath
my eyes not blended you'll see and this
color is pretty like spot-on from my
skin color it's just a wee bit later but
not much and I'm just gonna go people
use it as a concealer right but it's
everything you can use it's a concealer
you can mix it with moisturizer to make
foundation you can apply it just
sparingly by itself to do later coverage
it's just really versatile it's pretty
well known because one poor last you
forever because it's quite like it's
quite a lot of product again you get
right to the bottom of this and see when
I use that on rise oh my goodness I
thought it was gonna be too creamy but
it just made my skin look super buttery
and nice to us any of you guys have got
this because of me we have another use
for it now a min ago when it was my
concealer brush pick up a little bit and
when I see a little bit I mean a little
bit like tiny and I'm just gonna do that
on my eyelids and we're gonna bother and
this is gonna be the base for the eye
shadow and again I thought it's gonna be
too creamy and it actually it works so
well so it's quite nice being able to
use one products for a few things I'm
just gonna add we bet it's here in here
it's just to build up that coverage and
then I'm gonna use this brush to go up a
little bit higher underneath my eye but
you can get a little bit more precision
with a smaller brush now I'm going to go
in with my
Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish powder and then she's number two
on my let her do that thing before I
make up and then just the usual spots or
smile lines will do her forehead as well
alright I'm going to do just this
but here's our next product as from the
brand new specs I've used these products
a couple times on my channel this is a
beautiful
it's so nice this is the new DS stick
and the shade Bondi B and it's basically
like a contour stick but the color is
perfect it's like the pair of faith era
she cording to color that warms up your
face but doesn't make you orange it's
just great so I'm gonna use that
underneath my cheekbones forehead I like
to just do a little kind of Hilo now I'm
going to use my foundation brush just to
blend that in I feel like this just
makes it wee bit easier there is a brush
on the end of this but it's just a
little bit too far to use when you're
doing it over foundation I think when
you use this without foundation
underneath you can use the brush and it
looks great but this is just a little
bit more careful for me a little bit
safer do you see that perfect okay so we
are cream conjured know what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say that with a
bronzer this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills bronzer in the shade saddle just
try this for the first time yesterday
and it looked insane so good and it's a
really nice and matte bronzer as well so
I'm just gonna use this with my usual
bronzer brush
Methos product just go in with a little
bit of pain and it just helps set that
clean cotton to and warm up your face at
the same time and then I like to just
use the same bronzer gonna say do my
nose and then underneath and then on top
just a tip now I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of blusher this is the
California blush by benefit really nice
little quarterly blush and I'm just
gonna take a little touch of that all my
blinds are brushed and then apply it
just above the bronzer and then onto the
apples of the cheeks a little bit white
I love blusher so much right now I just
literally sweet and I don't think I
could ever look sweet do you understand
paym for highlighting I'm gonna go back
to oldie but goodie this is the Laura
Geller gilded honey baked
gelato myrtle aluminum
it makes me hungry hit the top of the
cheekbones the nose the lips the brows
the theis in general and that's
highlight a review of the brave can't
believe how much I love highly oh you
know it's really weird
I was thinking another day at one point
in my life I didn't we're highly Gina
remember I used to leer like no eyebrows
no highlighter but Phil faced a
foundation no concealer alright it was
bad it was bad time we're gonna take a
smaller brush just to ten - noise we
exclamation mark nice and it just gives
you that radiance in your skin even
though the Foundation's not super matte
it doesn't give that shine that I like I
love this skin I can't believe it
this concealer is really scary at first
it's really full coverage but one she
couldn't get used to using it man the
bags scans about finished I am going to
really quickly off and do my brows
off-camera and I'm just gonna use my
benefit karo pot and then my 24-hour
rosette of which this is the best brow
gel in the flippin would old try it you
will not be disappointed but I'm gonna
quickly show off because I know that
that eye makeups gonna take me quite a
while and I don't want this tutorial to
be a feature film for blame as we want
very few pros okay the palette I'm going
to use as the anastasius of gram pilot
the new one I have not used this yet if
you saw my subculture review you will
know that I didn't like it at all
but I've heard that this palette is
beautiful and it's the same formula as
the modern renaissance palette which is
another one not really like that pilots
so hopefully you know we're gonna manage
today let's see let's zoom you in man
you'll have to excuse me if the Leighton
is a bit off it's really sunny outside
today and I don't have any blames I
don't have any curtains because this
room is under construction so or if the
lighting changes loads I'm super sorry
does it look your nice palette okay
let's start with burnt orange just here
and let's use that in the crease yeah
Lynden really
music I'm just doing my usual nice
circular movements with my big fluffy
brush bring it on to the light a little
bit it's wellbecause but obviously doing
a cut crease we need the product to be
nice and more down and then we're gonna
need to start build it up this inner
corner but I'm gonna do that with darker
shades I think okay I'm gonna go in with
a little brush that comes with the
palette let's try that and I'm going to
go in with the color Sienna just right
here and we're gonna just start patting
that on and then give it a little
circular movement I'm not going to use
this brush right now this is too firm
for me I'm gonna use my smooth brush and
we're going with the Sienna color little
room see this is much better brand
movements and I'm gonna bring that color
right in over the crease and then I'm
gonna start building up that inner
corner as well just gonna go back in
with the first color and a bigger
fluffier brush will be to try and blend
this out a little bit and then I'm gonna
use my Becker fluffier brush with the
Sienna she didn't see that work okay I'm
going to connect the middle of the
spotlight because we need to get that
bit quite dark again I'm just gonna go
in with the fluffier brush and buff it
out there's quite a lot of those for
this look it just takes so long yeah
everything blend and we want it to I
think the key is just to start with a
little a nice product and then go in
heavier as you can carry on I'm gonna go
underneath my I know where these shades
Sienna again just here we're just gonna
start to smoke that a little bit Pegman
of these is pretty crazy like a really
really primitive you can see I just
literally tapped it in the shadow
guys I can pretty nice I'm gonna try and
intensify the outer corners in inner
corner a little bit so I'm gonna go in
with the shade mulberry just here I want
to keep it pretty ready toned to the
tiny amounts of product at a time we're
gonna go in with a little flat eyeshadow
brush and the
nobody and I'm gonna use that to get the
inner corner Nissan precise
oh-ho Ryan nice and precise I'm really
happy that this pilot as the good
formula and I'm just intensifying the
crease again because the more intense
you have this crease the more your
countries will pop back and with my
fluffy brush to blend it all go I'm
gonna go back in with the shade mulberry
this dark babe right here and we're
gonna go underneath or a corner of the
eye tell me about a fallout nothing too
bad when I use my own brushes this face
I'm gonna bring this country's time and
the one thing that I think is super
important as the brush you use I've been
using different brushes for a little
while and yesterday I actually did this
look at practice there and this brush
has changed the game for me this is the
Anastasia concealer brush so it's number
eighteen brush and see because it's just
so flat and it's got a little bit of a
rounded edge you can just place it on
and cut and it's really really good so
I'm gonna take a late concealer just any
late mat concealer that's got a good
pigment to it and you just pretty much
saturate your brush in it don't be
worried about using too much product it
only really works properly when you do
use quite a lot of products because it's
gonna be a middle like a spotlight cut
crease we're gonna start in the middle
and then I made a quick quiet when I'm
doing this but I will promise that I'm
gonna keep the whole process in this
video so let's just do this and then I
like to just kind of look up and it
stamps where you should do your crease
to go into the moment
and then what I'm gonna do now if we
want to blend the sides of the concealer
into the eye makeup and we'll see you
prove it up you can see how that's
starting to look somewhat there and then
it's just a lot of playing around and
seeing if you think they're even or not
this is definitely not even I can make
it work and then you can go in with your
eye shadow to kind of start blending the
sides and then after you need some help
a good tip is to go on your phone go on
a sale see and then look straight at the
camera and look down take a picture and
have a look that's not that bad do you
know what's crazy I actually just think
doing this on other people it's easier
than yourself
and if you're doing it all the time it
gets super easy it gets really really
good so if you really want to get good
at doing these the best advice is to
just get up and do one every single day
and you'll get so good at them I am now
going to set this little cut crease with
the latest shade and a soft brown
palette and a flat brush and these are
pigmented so that should work so you
just mattify right to the cut crease and
then over the concealer and I'm just
gonna use it to really highlight the
middle then you can always go in with
your concealer brush and just really
really sharpen it up and I'm just gonna
go in with a burnt orange and we're
gonna tackle this a to the spotlight and
then yeah just right now I'm gonna go in
with as teeny brushes is that morphe and
5:07 and I'm gonna go in with the shade
mulberry here and a little trick to make
your country stand out a little bit more
if you want is to go in with this brush
and you just go along the edge of the
cut crease and then what you can do is
you can go back in with the concealer
one more time to really sharpen it up
and then again just make sure you set
your concealer and see how much sharper
that
pretty to make it super extra we're
gonna go in with the Steeler captain
karma magnificent Maytals I'm gonna get
that on the back of my hand and I'm
going to step a less it just down the
center of the spotlight so when you step
let it kind of goes on like a really
fine loose glitter would see you got a
little bit machine and then I'm gonna go
in with the concealer brush one last
time pick up some of this product and
we're going to cut the crease with the
glitter I need to wait for this to dry
and now if you can see that when I look
straight ahead you can still see the cut
crease it means that the glitter won't
crease on to your shadow now I'm gonna
pack a wing on this look you don't have
to do this if you don't want to because
this makes my eyes look super round
I just want to elongate them a little
bit I got a replacement of my next epic
ink liner this is probably my favorite
liquid liner out there I'm just gonna do
some flex just now
now we've got a ring on I'm gonna pop on
my iconic London boom lash mascara and
then I'm gonna pop on it my saddle ashes
by Hooda time to do the rest of our face
I cannot believe we managed that cup
chasin scare me more than shimmery
eyeshadow for our lips I'm just gonna go
with something note and simple because
obviously the eye makeup is super load
so I'm going to go with my Charlotte
Tilbury
lip cheap pencil which needs sharpening
this is one of my favorite like paying
sells it's just the perfect nude and
then I'm gonna meet my lips super penny
and fill in the middle now I'm gonna
bring that on to the left a little bit
and then it for electro duck I'm going
to use the NYX soft matte lip cream and
your shade guide all and it's really
late so I'm just gonna use it in the
middle and then use my finger just to
blend that in oh I got a new circle pen
look this is the Dale Amanda long way or
tattoo eyebrow marker and the shade ash
brown and it's perfect for my little
flare color and it's got a real point to
it it looks way more realistic I'm gonna
did a lot what underneath my eye too
so you guys that is the finished look I
hope you really liked it I always still
struggle with some makeup techniques but
like I said the more that you practice
and the more that you just keep on doing
it and trying out different colors and
different techniques maybe you'll find a
technique that works back to the main so
I hope you liked it let me know if
there's any other Canon work tree if
they'll make up tutorials that you would
like to see for me and other than that I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
