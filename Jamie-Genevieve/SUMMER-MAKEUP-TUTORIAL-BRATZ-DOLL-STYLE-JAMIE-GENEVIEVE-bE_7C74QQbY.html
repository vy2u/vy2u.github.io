i am bringing you some bread style
realness
I recently caught a cool tweet which was
I think which means being mean ray it
was made to be nasty and it was a
picture of me and a friend his mane and
the court tweeted it and he said help
the Bratz dolls are taking over and I
was like thank you so much
they're beautiful they've got the guys
but glad the other comedians are in like
that is my aesthetic goal you know I
want to look like that so I thought what
I would do is I'd bring you this makeup
tutorial obviously I do not look like
Bill mm-hmm you can pick if you think I
look like a plastic doll or no but I
absolutely love makeup like guys I've
got tons of new products to try and I
have some new techniques as well so if
you would like to see how I created this
look then please stay tuned hello
first things first getting angulate I
don't have any nails on I came out boy
hum so I've done my skincare first thing
we're gonna do is use the Too Faced
hangover X primer this and the fainted
Beauty Pro filter matte primer of my
favorites this one is more dewy so if
you feel like you have drier skin you'll
love this I noticed a pump of that and
push it into my skin the next product
I've got here is the Charlotte Tilbury
flawless filter this is like a primer
/ke no foundation not really just gives
you a 10 this is the shitcan it's very
very dark but I actually like it to be
quite dark and I just like to put it not
like not that much because I'm going to
use it as a foundation or like primer
even I'm just going to use it like in
the middle area as it does croci but it
works a promise my foundation we're
going to use is the NARS nah mmm how
it's really natural really long wear
foundation this is the shade Stromboli
and I like to take three permit for the
back of my hand I say three years not
that much the pellets are just really
baby small in this product and I'm just
gonna take my smith one one five brush
to blend and this is just something I've
tried recently and these two products
together and
is just stunning it's really really play
see that doing that the dream so this
makeup here it's gonna be a full
coverage look this foundation I would
say is I'm duly but still coverage
foundation you can definitely read it
sheeter but I like to build it up a
little bit and it's just the nicest for
evening out my skin tone I think it
gives the most beautiful finish and it
lasts really long recently me and Jack
were in Vegas with NARAS which was with
the base there was such a cute check and
obviously Vegas is super hot and I was
reading this makeup during the day and
at night came I just have to do
touch-ups for Nate tape and it wore
oldie oldie it was perfect and I'm
bringing that foundation down my neck
say they've a cars if you look at my
shoulders I am super kind the dose
radiation do they really yellow and it's
late yellow and my neck is late as well
it's just that my college coach but I've
been in the Sun recently acquittal or
some B's and ten having a good time so
I'm really happy that I've got tired of
my body but those foundations are bit
too yellow it's not deep enough almost
but it's faint when the bronzer is on it
looks great I have a shiny new Beauty
Blender here this is one of the new cool
colors that they keep on bringing a
finish somebody the concealer I'm gonna
use I was going to use my usual Laura
Mercier flawless fusion concealer I
really love this but if you've been here
for a while you will know that I really
wanted to try this concealer this is the
soft matte concealer by NARS one night
when we were in Vegas
what you've actually kind of what this
makeup looks inspired by the you guys
really wanted to see it I use this to
highlight and do like under my eyes and
such like that and I got so many
compliments on it so I'm going to show
you guys how I did that so this is the
color ginger medium too and I'm going to
go in with my Beauty Blender and that's
so it's pretty crazy until it's finished
boy it's so beautiful once it's done so
what I'm gonna do I start to build that
up underneath my eyes and I kind of
brought it down quite far doing here
because I want this whole area to be
super bright this is like snatched
this is a snatched make up it lasted so
well and I use this concealer to build
up coverage doesn't like the statement
for my face in general I'm just keep on
going back in there's my little blender
I think it's pay cake just go ahead me
oh it looks so good
like someone actually asked me if I'd
wait and got something done when were in
Vegas they were like what do you have
done which a nesting age is a total
complement your thanks
so don't take a wee bit longer to fly
and stuff it down but this is like
proper makeup makeup this is still
silver I'm I'm going to take my tart
double duty Beauty shape tape I primer
and I just like scribbling scribbling
that on all over my legs I'm gonna just
blend that in with my Beauty Blender so
what is the concealers on you do have to
say it this one I'm gonna use my
Charlotte Tilbury oh my god that's so
dirty yeah I'm gonna use airbrush Flo's
finished I do it number two you guys
know I absolutely love this product as
staple I use it every single day and I'm
just gonna pair it on right under eyes
my legs the shoot tip concealer LEDs
thing that primer creases really quick
so you need to make sure you get in
there and say it's out otherwise it
looks like a mess I'm just gonna do my
smiling's I'm actually gonna go ahead
and finish my skin I was doing this I
just think it means me I don't know if
you'll we weren't more complete before I
did my eye makeup so the new bronzer
that I've been using as the NARS Casino
bronzer so everyone knows we're gonna
everyone loves Laguna this is casino
which is a bit darker and I have been
absolutely loving this for giving my
face nice - it's a really nice shape for
kind of contouring as well because I
haven't used another product I just
really like it so many use this with my
Smith one one eight brush just to start
sculpting this face I did always really
liked Laguna but this color is much
better for me and I'm going to do the
whole thing I'm gonna bronze my head
under my chin and
I go this chic little NARS blush this is
really really popular this little brush
it's like a little kabuki and I love to
use this with a tiny touch of the
bronzer to just snatch that in the woods
a little bit more look at me and my
terminology snatched bolused
flawless I'm really excited about this
makeup now we're going to take my casino
bronzer again and a bigger brush and I'm
just gonna do more of a kind of lifts
bronzing of the face all over and this
brush is the morphe in for to such a
good big bronzer brush and in that we
cannot bring it down the neck or
highlight I am going to use the brand
new NARS orgasm illuminating loose
powder so this is like a highlight but
if you look it looks super rose gold but
you can see that shine is stunning with
you see just annul it and because it's
kind of that nice rose gold you can
bring it on to the cheek a little bit
like I can illuminate and blush I just
think it's beautiful
according to some little bit deeper than
my usual highlight I'm going to go in
with my usual makeup or pal phase B and
I'm just gonna hit the very top of my
cheekbone and then I'm gonna use this to
highlight my nose and brow bone and keep
his bullets we'll just because the rose
gold is a little bit deeper so it leaves
a slate cast but you don't want on the
center of your face okay I'm gonna zoom
you in a little bit and then we will do
our eye makeup I'm gonna get my face a
little spray of the I don't know how to
say this
or our queen of Hungary mess embarrass
myself for eyes I'm going to be using
the new huda beauty coral obsessions
pilot this is gorgeous I've been using
that fear but recently really gorgeous
warm brains but also those kind of coral
colors which I have been love
data is there and the color we're going
to start with and it's just this little
guy in the middle really nice transition
shades and we're just gonna start
fighting that and it creeps like normal
this look is gonna be super summery and
gorgeous which is perfect because it's
20 feet crease excited I am inside so
this is probably the most neutral color
we're going to be using becuase I really
want to play with the coral colors of
this palette because they are so
pigmented and platon gorgeous so I think
the next one will go in with is this guy
here it just makes peach color that I
want my eyes to be big today the first
transition color just helps us get
everything nice and matte for the next
sheets wrap it on just so they blend
nicely using the save in my brush to
help blend up towards the Bruce smoothly
and then I'm bringing that into the
inner corner as well so you can see that
I've brought my eye shadow blend really
high up which I'm just really liking
these days I'm gonna go in with is
really deep pink color to try build this
eyelid a couple Oh Pat wants to be a wee
bit more dramatic and I'm just going on
with a slightly smaller brush and then
I'm bringing that onto the legend that
our corner as well and I'm gonna keep it
quite light like the darkest color I'm
going to use is it gonna be that dark
because I want the main focus to be the
gorgeous bright color and then we're
gonna do a really shimmery light as well
one product of God recently and I am
really really excited about as the dose
of colors block party eyeshadows this is
the shade shall we dance
so we're gonna use this on the lid with
a flat brush and we're gonna wet product
as well you can kinda weight the product
with whatever you want
I've actually been using my queen of
Hungary mess because it's right here
really really easy so let's try that and
we're just gonna pack this on the lids
grab the products first get a spray
these shadows are honestly absolutely
stunning
I've been playing around with them a
little bit I've used the gold one which
I really like I've used the cat
he one could have just used that all
over my eye and it looked unbelievable I
really it's like they're brilliant so
I'm just gonna bring this up above the
crease because it gives that kind of a
serial fantasy
I'm just gonna put one lever there so in
first and then I'm actually gonna go in
my finger absolutely gorgeous I just
think that that is amazing I think it's
so pure so far the best look and a
little bit of extra dry Martin to really
brighten everything up I'm actually
gonna go in with my Englert wait wait as
a number 76 of the AMC eyeliner gel it
is so old it's cracked in half but what
I'm gonna do is take another spray of
that Hungary Queen mist and I'm just
gonna use a salafiyyah brush I don't
know this is gonna work this stuff is
indestructible it is crazy it makes a
little bit of eyeshadow primer with the
gel and it seems to be working a bit
better but this wait I am going to apply
it in my inner corner and you can see
that just adds a real pop of brightness
so it's crazy to paint but when we put a
little bit of highlighter on top I'm
going to use the bare cutoff pole it's
gonna look glorious okay and you can see
that just gives the greatest most
gorgeous inner corner highlight now I
need to decide that I want wings or not
I think you do know real life black dog
would have no wings for my eyeliner I'm
going to use the edge cosmetics
superhero laner
I'm gonna be honest I don't think this
is the easiest thing to work with but it
does give a really beautiful matte way
oh I've had old school Jimmy G wing I am
going to show off camera really really
quickly interest in my mascara and
lashes and I will be back in two minutes
okay I don't like my top mascara but I
thought I would just quickly do
my lower lash will be reading for the
lashes to dry the mascara that I used
was the it cosmetics superhero Scott I
really like it crumbles just a little
bit but it gives you really nice thick
chunky lashes which is great underneath
my eyes I'm gonna just bring this shade
right here
buff that eye underneath your eyes for a
nice smoky but like a light smoky lash
line and then we are doing this is
they'll just get a smaller brush can
I'll lay it flat against my seeds and
just start the blade and you see her
that just kind of gets that shadow
gorgeous now I'm just gonna try and
build up my lower lash it to be nice and
chunky in the sec not a look for
everybody I understand but I really kept
the first coat but you see how much
frightened don't make your eyes like I
really look especially was a nice big
long way stick these wee lashes on these
are just the Lily lashes and Miko knows
there's a probably my sixth time weird
in this thing I really like a bit
reading these lashes when I mean in
liner I have it meeting my lash line
here by actually place the lash a little
bit higher on my eye and that's what
gives you that super big eye effect but
I do this a lot when I'm doing later can
you see her that totally changes the
shape of my eyes and then here we're
gonna just leave it kind of sittin on
the liner a little bit higher it up do
you see this is my favorite new thing to
do with my brows it is so easy and great
and it's like using two products I've
got my 24 hour brave sailor favorite
brow gel in the world
and then I've got gimme brow which is
back I kept my brow gel go right through
my eyebrows and that just makes them go
in the right place that's where they're
meant to be and then I wouldn't win with
my gimme brow well the brow gel is still
drying and this is
get color and the kind of builds and up
of the braids and for anyone who asks
I've seen a few comments if we don't get
my face done
I actually just tweeze them myself and I
don't tweeze them too much just whatever
strays pop up underneath and then I just
use an eyebrow razor to get rid of any
strays like that grow up my forehead to
try to sabotage my life and then once
the braves start to go a little bit
tacky you can feel it the gels starting
to say that's when i really go into the
front of my brows get them all standing
up nice just like that it doesn't look
like much but it's all I need when I've
got this much eye makeup on and I'm
gonna do a little lip we're starting to
look sufficiently like a cartoon perfect
what we really do know is our lips and I
absolutely cannot believe I've never
tried this before this is the NARS
precision lip liner and yeah they
probably do this to me man I can't see
these fancy words here these hate why he
was a thing above it are es the most
amazed and not likely in our ever I'm so
so happy so I'm gonna lay my lips really
big like a Bratz doll like this is gonna
be my finest over drawing woman in
yesterday and then we're gonna do some
lip I know I was gonna use their
archives and wet bar which is so
gorgeous I'll show you on right so this
is the orgasm lip balm from NARS part of
the nucleic shine and I wore this
yesterday with just this lip liner and
it was beautiful super natural lip balm
by itself but with a lip liner it just
gets a nice touch of rosy pink and
obviously it's a lip balm so it's really
really nice and hydrating really really
kept but I feel in my body I need to use
a really really pitching it I'm going to
use my
I'm just gonna put it over the lip balm
actually because it feels really nice
this is the Maybelline super matte ink
and shade driver I'm just gonna Pat that
said no it's not light enough so what
I'm going to do really cheeky I'm gonna
go in with a concealer banner fret cult
and that's the side of the guys I really
really hoped you liked this makeup I
absolutely love it I know that this
tutorial is called black skull but
honestly I love looking like this and
