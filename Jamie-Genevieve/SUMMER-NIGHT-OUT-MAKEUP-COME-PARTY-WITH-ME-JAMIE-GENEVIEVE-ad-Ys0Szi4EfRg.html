as well
everyone any more information on
everything I just say but please go to
the COPE youtube website and without
further ado if you'd like to see how I
created this look I'm just a chipped
peda first things first and we are going
to I feel like I want to do my eyes
first yeah let's do that I'm gonna pray
my skin first of all using the Too Faced
hangover to explain my two little
squirts to that and then we're gonna
have our hands together and just apply
that all over even if you're doing your
eyes first it's quite nice to put your
primer on before that because it gives
it
and to second and get nice and tacky
four-eyes first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm actually just gonna conceal my light
so they can see there I'm going to be
using state as the board Nestle to face
concealer and these shade light/medium I
were just gonna scribble on to our
eyelids and you're done I'm just gonna
beautiful in that and there once you've
done that you just need to be sure to
say it tip so I am delighted to say that
I have a brand new Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish powder this is
my senior at the water with my last one
decided to die and by that I mean I
dropped in this match so we're just
gonna apply this powder to our lights
and that just saves the concealer and
weren't ready for eye shadow perfect let
me zoom you and the pilot I won't be
using today is the hood of beauty warm
brand obsessions these little colors I
think are so great they are really nasty
and small they're great for travel which
is brilliant for me from traveling and I
just think that these colors are perfect
you can get quite a lot of looks I've
just one little tiny pilot first thing
we're gonna do is we're going to go in
with this transition color right here
and we're just gonna build up in the
crease
obviously this is gonna be my party look
so I do want it to be quite dramatic
I just can't bloody decide what I want
to do and these are all palettes this is
just one of them there's tons of
different colors color combinations to
choose from and they're all just great I
think that I don't think they get enough
sleep actually I think that it's all
good right what an air I'm going to do
my balls so the next color I'm going to
go in with is just this bottom corner
here super chocolaty warm room and I'm
just gonna start building that up in the
air a corner first it's in black and I'm
not worried about
spillages because we can just clean them
up and I'm just going to bring that
color a little bit higher in the crease
now I'm going to go in with that same
dark color and I'm going
stamp that and then a corner and that's
going to give us this start of a
spotlight I now I'm going to go in with
a smaller brush and the darkest color in
the palette just here and we're going to
start to intensify the outer corner and
I'm just keeping it on the outer corner
I'm not bringing it into the center of
that eye at all if you want to intensify
it more just get the product and Pat it
on rather than just blending it our way
every time because that will just take
you along and we've got a party to go to
okay I'm going to take my little brush
again in the dark color and we're just
going to tank aside that inner corner
ever so slightly I'm just taking the
transition color to soften this boat
light a little bit and make sure that
everything is nice and matte no I'm
going to win with that Center color the
most gorgeous gold for the night through
a pine that in the center and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring that
right up to the brow
oh I love it it makes your eyes look
absolutely massive when you do this and
if you find it easier you can even just
keep your eye or pen well you're
applying that gold now that I've done
that expect I know that I want to just
deepen that over corner one more time
now I'm going to take my NYX go to a
primer on the back of my hand you guys
know I love this stuff and I've got a
really easy technique to doing this that
makes it look really special I'm gonna
take a fluffy brush and pick up the
clutter Kraemer first and we're just
gonna dot that on the center of the
spotlight I write up past the crease and
then I wouldn't take I can't look I
can't look up I'm gonna take my next
glitter and this is initiate Goldstone
and we're gonna open that and we're
going to apply a nice down it center of
the spotlight eye using the same brush
and because we're applying with a fluffy
brush it goes on just a little bit more
random rather than a big splurge of
glitter Oh
and then the glue is pretty good but you
have some you have some playtime with it
and then you can put one some more if
you need I think my favorite thing about
grungy looks like this is it doesn't
need to be perfect okay I am NOT THERE
anything I haven't really slept - with
my makeup but it seems I worked well for
four I'm gonna zoom you and we're
actually gonna go out and finish the
rest of her face and then come back to
eyes so Hal is all right okay so you can
see it from afar it just looks super
romantic at the moment
ain't gonna stay like that we're going
to get real grungy so I have framed my
face already the next stop is the neon
photography fluid or passive heat feels
pristine I don't know if you guys
remember but I went absolutely crazy
over this product and I'm super excited
to use it again that is stunning
it's like a veil over your face that
makes force of your skin look incredible
it gives you a really nice glow as well
so I've got some in my hand here and I'm
just gonna take it on my fingers and
apply that all over at my skin as
stunning and it's not heavy at all it
just gives your skin that really nice
shame it's called pigments in it that
just brings back so your skin looks like
it's gluing it from inside next is
foundation today I'm going to be using
the Born This Way Foundation by Too
Faced and all the favorite of mine I'm
going to take a couple of pumps on the
back of my hand and then I'm just gonna
blend that and with a brush the color of
use and by the way as sand as the most
beautiful golden undertone foundation
however this foundation is definitely on
the more glowy site so as you guys are
looking for a medium to full coverage
that's dewy and you maybe have dry skin
this foundation is perfect once our
friend nations on and we'll go back to
my Born This Way concealer and we're
just going to conceal all of the usual
spots under our eyes keep the full turn
the little exclamation mark on your nose
and then the little forehead tree and
then I'm just going to push that into
the scan
use a nice flat brush and then up near
the under eye I'm just going to take a
clean blending brush just to blend that
up to worse I because you don't want to
ruin your eye makeup now I'm just going
to go end up with my Charlotte Tilbury
powdered again and we're just going to
go under the eyes now I'm going to take
my nude sticks nudies and Bondi Beach
this is just kind of stick color that I
really like to use for pink contouring
so I'm going to take this and we're just
gonna sculpt the face the cheekbones
we're gonna go to a new chin to meet my
jawline like smashed and not like of
course he'll face and then just the
forehead like so and then I'm actually
just going to take my suggestion brush
and blend that and you can see that is
bronze as the face up as I actually saw
stunning the texture and the finish it
gives your skin I absolutely love it
I've been using that product today and
it's really nice if you're not holiday
and you just want to put a bronzer on
your skin for bronzer today to say this
I'm going to be using the benefit hoola
bronzer and I'm just going to take a big
fluffy brush for those and we're going
to start staying in this quarter and
Blondin up the face a little bit and
once you've done that with a big Brush
you can go in with a smaller brush just
to concentrate the bronze are on one
area and makes it more the contour and
I'm just going to contour my nose
slightly with hoola as well you know
that is the perfect color for a corner
it's not too orange at all
I would snatch so when I'm going out out
to the party I actually don't like to
use blusher I just like to use bronzer
and highlighter and get that kind of
golden goddess vibe so the highlighter
as the Becca opal this was probably one
of my first purchases of coke view it is
very special to me this must be like my
10th Baker opal highlight eres what God
so I'm just gonna apply that everywhere
and then send it on my face I love it
I'm ready to buff the brow as well -
once super glowy skin I'm gonna take a
little clean eyeshadow brush and we're
just gonna highlight the brow bone
before we do a tight race as well we are
gonna go back into the eye bolts and
finish them off okay you can see that
it's getting close up I just love it
we're gonna start making the eyes a
little bit more dramatic so I'm going to
take my nude sticks magnetic I color and
this is the shade mate and it is just a
super creamy black like black pants oh
I'm ready is going to go in the
waterline with this and I'm going to
tightline my eyeball I really hate doing
this like look how encased like that as
it's loaded tight line that was no bad
this is a much comfier pan so now what
we're going to do is go back into our
eye shadow pilot and I'm going to take
this super dark color first and we're
going to smoke out this black pants cell
underneath our eye and then once you've
done that that dark color I'm going to
take the warmer dark brown and I'm just
gonna really buff this out and warm up
the under eye a little bit just with
Matt just to talk a little bit more and
the way I do that is just don't be
scared to go in with your color
Leigha against your cheek and just cool
for lashes I'm going to be using the
huda beauty lashes and the stale Kamille
number 16 they're really small is short
so you can just stick them on or much
easier than the long one so we're going
to use these today and look for mascara
I'm gonna use an oldie but goodie this
is the benefit roller lash mascara and
we're just gonna apply it Jane
cooked on the top and bottom lashes and
this little mascara wand has a slight
curve to it so it just cuddles your
little bottom lash and you can really
build them up for lips I am going to be
using the Juhi long-wear cream lip liner
and the shade sienna and I'm going to be
using the next lip going to be and
dusk-to-dawn which is just a really
light light light kind of more cuddly -
it's it's really pretty so we're gonna
do lip liner first as usual and then I
know that this lipstick is super light
so what I'm going to do is apply it and
then I'm gonna pass it on with my finger
so you guys this is the finished look No
for the cult bTW birthday party I am
sorted makeup-wise I just need to go get
something to wear the next time you'll

khaki jumpsuit and like suit trousers

regret it already
