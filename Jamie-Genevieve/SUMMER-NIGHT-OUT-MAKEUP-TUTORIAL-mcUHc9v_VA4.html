I have teamed up with dick of scarlet to
show you how to create this look deco
Scarola
as a makeup brand and every two months
the release in new palette and it's
always in collaboration with youtuber or
insulin so it's really really cool I'm
sure you guys will have seen a few of
their palettes before but one of my
friends sponder deluxe actually did have
a palette with similar available so it's
a really cool way to buy makeup because
your support in one of your favorite
youtubers and you'd like to see her
actually the slickest pigeons so we're
just confessed I'm gonna pour point my
Chi press is a new is an antioxidant do
quench angle serum one two three drops
this is the my usual cushion now mister
called my moisturizer this is the
separate multi created cream by Kiehl's
I've been using this on and off for it
quite well but I ran it my skin close
cream so that's why I'm using today I
actually did really like hit the wall at
an anti-aging moisturizer but also it
just does everything basically when I
got those through they were seeing that
I just targets pretty much every skin
concerned so I was like Pacific it I'm
just going to pop that on the skin is
nice and fresh now quickly to do the
base the way that I've been doing this
is so I still look super bronzed and I
use my toilet stick foundation and tan
sand and I just do lanes demo series and
the noise and obviously it's pretty
times or nice or what I do then as I get
my makeup forever six and Asian and
white three six five and I'm just going
to draw some sin lines in between top
foundation absolutely love makes and
foundations if you think that you've got
foundation ek know like but I knew it's
not a very quickly retail extra for you
or it's not the right color
try mixing it makes a huge difference
no
going to get my kill the daily rising
concentrate you guys know a lot of stuff
and we did a little drop thing so four
drops cheeks chin and head focus
techniques and I was going to
Beautyblender listen and the foundations
makes really really real together I
think the part one's a little bit more
matte and then the oil obviously makes
everything super dewy and then the
makeup for everyone is a little bit more
dewy as well so it's just a nice
combination but actually it's not the
most full coverage that I've done back
Whitley Catwoman creep free she'll sit
with makeup look a lot then we Bend that
vein my neck a little bit and then a
little bronze best part of my neck were
just drawing so you can still see a
little bit a little bit more blemishes
to go on as you can see a little couple
of little spores but I might prefer on
my skin with connect can I share and do
then super cakey or we to do now is I'm
going to get my Tarte concealer this is
actually the shade kind of sand so it's
a lot darker than I usually use but it
kind of matches my skin tone butter is
going to spot conceal and then I like to
just add extra coverage in the middle of
a forehead going to say to my nose and
obviously a couple of little dots under
my eyes and this does really feel
coverage but you can see it kinda
matches my skin color so it's not too
not too late for common blemishes and
also I quite like using just my skin
color under my eyes these days just
because it doesn't look so harsh but it
still gives me that nice greatness and
not as a super gui-based
perfect putting a pure foreign wine
press metal makeup and if she's late
time and I'm just going to hide in my
eyes
using kind of dabbing motions just we
don't move the product around too much
underneath and in between my those claps
where I get super oily now I'm just
going to take my Mac it gives me some
drawings art with my Charlotte Tilbury
blusher brush and we're going to run our
makeup and then add a little bit of
warmth to our cheeks and orifice okay
now I'm going to show off camera prepare
my eyelids and do my brows and he'll be
right back now move on to the exciting
bits I've got here at a deck of scarlet
and what happened is we open up and
inside is really chic I love the package
and the inside has got a not torn
Nazanin I'm really sorry for your new
room and then so it says for my love I
was chosen Victor Crowley asked me to
partner with them to put together a
palette for the Cavalli true I hope you
like these pinks and peaches as much
about the accounting to see your
beautiful faces and they let you create
with it so super sweet it got all our
social stuff there as well and we've got
a note from Tim scarlet seeing enjoy our
July August palette and then we take
this full coral and append a pool we've
got the palette and we've also got
whatever is worth it this month so this
month is a later and then let's also
misspell about so it's really chic
package and it's super a real package we
do use we break things breed King and a
meal or anything like that and then end
here we've got the sleeves on the back
we have got a little message and a skull
and then we've got the ingredients for
the pilot as well particular
sleep or and in a lake the waders it's
done now to the coil the packaging is
obviously very clear that that's
something that you keep amazing as you
refuse you keep our server and an
emphasis got the powders on the states
we've got three eyeshadows a highlight
and a blusher
then you call it that and then on the
other side we have two lip colors so if
an orange until you write know that I'm
going to use this one it's called
birthday suit is
beautiful deep notes let's get into this
I have put on my best shadow already so
I'll paint my eyes of Lemoore pan pot
and I've popped the beer shuttle down
and the first color I'm going to go for
is a feeling peachy no this is really
beautiful orange shades it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it I'm going to
use out for my crease anyway
oh it's got good method on it so we're
just using that through the crease just
the same movements as always when to
wait for movement and then using our
brush lost that up we're born there so
pretty high up so I'm just using my
brush the dresser means that this is li
bar 2 to 1 now already born with a
blusher babydoll which is a beautiful
matte pink and we're also just going to
use this and it fees I remember I used
to use pink eyeshadow all the time I
think one of the reasons that I really
like this idea of getting these palettes
monthly is because it really makes you
can echo at your comfort zone if you
feel like you're stuck using the same
color the same finish the same product
it really does cannot make your
experiment it really makes you can
experiment with makeup again it's been
so long since Italy bit more colorful
that's gorgeous you see that so pretty
and now I'm actually use the same brush
and the same BB gold blusher I was going
to see that under my eyes
now that we go in with the deeper color
in the palette cache and I'm going to
use the same brush again and we're just
going to start building up that crease a
little bit more
I went above that kind of slightly onto
the ledge as well now our flops might
leave up to two four and I'm just going
to buff that underneath my lower lash
line as well so I'm going to over my
finger and the she'd show cute shall Q
and I'm just going to pop that on as a
nice light shimmer on the lid it is kind
of rate into arts a little bit now I'm
going to take the later the deck of
scarlet later and the shade of coral
karate and it is a really gorgeous deep
brown lino and it's been so long to use
anything other than black so I'm excited
to try out and we're going to do some
flicks we're going to do some wings and
at the same point
I'm super popular Lane recessive at the
brush point rather than the fill tip so
it's really really easy to use
that is a really nice Matt Blome lino
and it's Matt it's like Matt Lee more
Shane off this at all and they kid okay
let's do the same thing on the same and
was Drew
so I may come up a little bit but you
know what you do you just need some
bigger now I'm going to check on some
mascara this is just my pure silly tars
mascara and blacks
just like that mascara completely
screams our eyes and then we're going to
shove some lashes on planet where we end
for the glue to dry on the lashes I'm
just going to go in with the shades baby
doll again the bright pink blusher and
I'm just going to pack that onto the
creases one more time let's hit a little
bit later and then I'm actually going to
jump into the highlight Yasmin to top
and we'll pop in a corner of course and
then I'm just going to add that Highway
just under my brows well actually I'm
going to go ahead and just finish off my
skin from my last note guys I'm going to
take the blusher and baby doll and we're
going to apply this just to our cheeks
and it's good because of use this blush
on eyes everything tire really nicely
and then I'm going to take the highlight
and the shade Yasmine and I'm going to
apply this to my cheeks oh that's good
that was a good pilot wow it's really
beautifully meld it don't look chunky at
all it's super I'm gonna love it and I'm
just going to apply that to my kids ball
I'm going to get a slightly smaller
brush this is just my key call or one
I'm going to use a very cap and we're
just apply that above my brow and the
lashes I'm nearly dry I'm going to go
through my brows one more time with my
little Maybelline brow gel just make
sure my clothes are dark there's no
highlighted layer I'm going to use my
deck of Scarlett just the liner because
it's braids I was doing a little
critical perfect I need any new one for
that now I'm going to line my lips with
a liar at lipliner the usual for me
you
and then I am going to swap over say it
so you call the post day and the reason
that we do that is a little milk powder
gets on top of their lip product because
their cream the proto ridges speculate
on top so it's a really easy way to make
sure that everything stays neat and tidy
and I'm actually just going to go in
with my finger and would Pat it on you
guys know that I love finger blamed in
the product so anyway so the cotton was
like I can out mix between our lip gloss
and our lipstick but it's super
pigmented so it's really comfy on so
pretty easy to blend as well and then
last but not least we're going to just
do a lot about highlight on the nose but
provide totally forgot and let's set
this bad boy I'm going to use my Urban
Decay all nighter spray and then I'm
just going to push that and I think this
is super perfect for like a summer May
outlook to the Stealth's of the flesh
from the skin we still got that drown
with a little wink
sinuan so you guys that is the finished
look I really really hope you liked it
if you look down in the description bar
I will have a link to a deck of Skylar
and also you get 10% off your first
purchase like I said earlier I think
it's a really cool idea for people like
me who actually get stuck a lot of ever
run maybe something in a definite to do
so makeup please let me know if you like
this look and comment overlook what you
would like to see from me next and other
