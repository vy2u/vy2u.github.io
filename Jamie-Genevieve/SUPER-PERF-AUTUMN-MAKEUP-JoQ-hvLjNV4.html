today we are going to do a super
autumnal makeup look and focus on this
look around the morphe 35o palette which
is like gold dust in the community if
you didn't know and I'm using a whole
bunch of new stuff some of it is
presentations some of it is stuff I use
a couple of times and then I've got some
come out old favorites in here as well
if you'd like to see ook at this look at
stitching so what we're going to do is
we're going to start off with some cream
Fluffy's this is the skin pure cloud
King with Arctic base and pick tides
this is a relatively neutral it to me
although I have tried to hide it like a
long time ago I got like a little sash
of it look it's the weirdest texture
ever it's like jelly I really like this
because it is super light but it's
really really hydrating as well and I
feel like when I use there my skin is
hydrated all day
my foundations these are nice but my
oils can more under control as well
because it's quite lightweight and I do
have oily skin mmm hydration I would
definitely give them a little look in a
year I look for a new cream because I've
been really liking this but anything
were to use as foundation this is the
buy it Haley terribly dense illis I
don't think I see that right Amy it's
like a 70 pound foundation once again I
could shake it has like a stick it's a
weirdest thing room I'll actually just
add this but I'll see how that goes I
might need more mighty lips and let his
people in the end so sense I call this
foundation and matching pair of fake 5
bit on holiday go up in daily so this
might be so lightly to like I think it's
beautiful I think it's like amazing
coverage doesn't feel like anything
lasts all day when I smelt it well it's
not strong it's not like I don't quite a
lot of high-end
friend each ends when you put them on
it's like an overpowering smell
let's has a nice smell to it but is not
too strong I'm not trying to play it
with a bra
Shh but with a beauty blender it was
really lovely next thing we're going to
do is use the by Terry highlights and
concealer brush so this isn't just the
shade one so it's the lightest shade and
it's one of these guys you pump it from
the bottom and it comes at the top
that's rest of it okay I should put this
on from making warriors and crazy you
need like a fair amount of pumps before
you get much using this and the kind of
sports that I would take to highlight
and then Beauty Blender nose in I am
just putting a tiny little bit of my
Born This Way Foundation on top of that
for Indian and it's a beautiful and it's
an really nice coverage it's just that
we but to peel for me just now so I'm
just blending that together makes me
want to do I'm going to go in with the
bite eighty I be strain to fix more
liquidate and what I am used to but this
is all betraying this stuff and should
apply that with my Urban Decay Dawn
concealer brush you do not need much of
this stuff Atilla nice I guess like a
nice kind of veil to the eye area I'm
just using my Beauty Blender to apply
that underneath my eye I were to go off
camera to do my brows I'm just going to
use my get dry by anastasiya and my ass
has a gribbler Hills brow gel and I'll
be right back to do those clearly than
this I already I like to have a practice
I think that's what it is I didn't know
I'm going to do but I am I'm so excited
because I'm using the morphe 35o palette
so this is probably I would say the most
famous pilot from morphe everybody wants
it and for the longest time we can get
it but I happen to know for a fact that
cochleae
have it back in stock in any do you know
I would go and sign up to get notified
when it's going to be in stock because
it's it's fantastic
let's just say that I'm gonna I'm going
to use
now ensure you so what I've done already
is I have pop this all over my eyes a
bit and one with this color here now as
my transition I'm also going to go under
my eye first with my vitality hyaluronic
I can't say that word
hi hyaluronic hyaluronic you know I mean
it's a nice ingredient that can add
draws moisture so I'm going to go in
with that powder only five because I've
got my vacation already and then I'm
doing my eyes so when it's nice and
powdered underneath my eye
it means if I have any fallout it's
really easily just going to brush the
way so we remember that lovely
transition shades and my mark two to
four brush and I'm just going to start
applying that and the crease these
shadows well we're tell you the honest
truth I got a morphe palette about a
year ago maybe maybe a year ago and it
was the 35 in palette or peepal or
something anyway
the colors in it Rogers colors that I
would not use her and I just didn't take
the Pegman to that goods and I just
didn't like it I personally do like cool
tones on my eyes all so yeah I don't
care put it aside and then I got this I
got sadness by copulate and they were
like Jimmy who think you're gonna love
this and I was like you're right I do
love it now I want to go in with this
color here which is just in a kind of
deeper transition shade and then we're
going to go in with like that color here
which is a really warm ready and then
this one here which is a really deep
braid and that's all the matches we're
gonna use just to deepen up the crease
it's gonna be sitting and obviously all
the twins were using are super warm
which is exactly why I like on my
peepers I'm going to use my 3 by 2007 a
this is the lot softer fader brush and
I'm going to go in with the darker
transition shade and I'm just building
that up in the crease I have my mother
in her face and I'm in the way here so I
was making it really easy to place my
color on my crease and then I'm going to
go back in with my 2 to 4 and the latest
color and I'm just gonna start helping
Upland I bring my Blanes
pretty far up towards my brow
they like big Bluto some monkeys monkeys
you know once read about em wear this
color here underneath my eye and I'm
going to use my semester 30 brush I just
like Beldon up evenly over the top from
the bottom so I can kind of see how dark
I wanna go I just love the shape that
goes my eyeball
so are you guys buzzing for housing or
what I've got a couple tutorials planned
I'm really excited about them one as a
recreation of a look that I've done for
the last four years I'm sure you can
guess what it is now I'm going to go in
with two shades it's smack bang in the
middle of this pilot this one here it's
like a really beautiful warm brown but
it's dark and then like I said powder
means you can just recall that way easy
peasy lemon squeezy
okay once it's done that I'm going to go
in with my little Smith's
- sighs three brush and I'm going to go
in with this color here right under my
brow and I it's a really lovely blue
highlight you can't tell another side
highlight my inner corner with that nice
row highlight shade and I know what I'm
gonna do and that's my favorite thing
with a whole palette but all these
shadows are super pigmented but see this
color here I'm gonna swatch it for you
right now
right in the corner zealous or Stern so
I'm going to go in with my sleeper
smokey shader brush the two three four
it's just a flat eyeshadow brush and I'm
going to push that onto my lid if
October was an eyeshadow it would be
that eyeshadow I feel what I'm gonna do
now is I'm going to glue up my eyelash
this is the Samantha lash by who the
beauty
and as usual I'm going to leave that to
dry a little bit and then I'm going to
give it a little up a little play around
with make sure it's stuck on there
feeling that I look ok let's bronze up
the bronzer I'm going to use as my SD
edit we release bronzer I'm just gonna
use that with my morphe in photo to
brush and the shade I am in this bronzer
is white and I'm just using that enough
to get a nice Suncoast look to be honest
it's on you can get really thin Abby but
peeled if you want not me bro but you
know you do you next product I'm going
to use and my cabinet Warren sculpting
powder and this is the powder in medium
but okay I wanted this for a bit for
years and it's taken me four years to
get it but I'm going to use my Smith 1-1
to brush my favorite contour brush and
this is just the most beautiful sculptor
look at that Wow
it's just the nicest thing ever and then
I just like a little bit three up here I
would know contour Rendell's with it
I've tried it and it's just a little bit
too ashy if that makes sense
so what I like to do is just go in with
my bronzer again and the one 1/2 brush
and just bronzer in the bottom and keep
that going to size just really quickly
no crazy look crazy nose contouring
today next product as my lord gala wrote
a blush and brighten and sun-swept
I was always really put off water Kaler
because Judy see but anyway I love this
so I get a little bit on my morphe brush
again I am 402 and see just a little
touch just above where the squatchers is
it a pair of I'm like autumnal
skin and you know me guys I'm not a huge
blush brand but I'll let that one slide
the next day I'm going to use as my
chemic one candle a celestial powder
wait to see those so this is not strong
by any means is not like my strong
highlight which I'm going to do still
but I'm gonna just show you this one I'm
gonna use my warm onto a brush though
and look at
hisses hmm
is that not so like training I love it I
think I would use days for like I don't
know like see honestly if I was going to
a huge event and there's going to be
flash photography I will use this
highlighter because it was so show up in
photography but it won't like how hasn't
seen this but too extreme anyway getting
off that I'm going to win it with a
brand-new barrel pole because I finally
replan it and our ways same brush again
and this is this is the highlight I like
to wear and it's like day to day
can you believe it and I'm doing on
camera there's no there's no CGI I don't
know how to do CGI get my finger OOP
when you see your highlights too strong
and I'm just going to use my beauty
blender just to pair that into my
knowledge there's no lanes same thing on
my life I'm going with glowing pencils
and then for lips I'm going to use a
cave and a corn jewel so this is the
flesh torn pencil and this is the shade
medium and then this is the matte lip
color and it's the shade evermore so
these are like the colors to have if you
like him to flip so that's where I got
obviously because I'm a news 5
you know I look about this pencil as a
perfect new cheer but it's not too dark
I have a real tendency to go fro super
dark nude lips lay nose even if I'm
doing like a super light lipstick so
this is I agree agree color for me and
then this is the lipstick here I'll show
you the back of my hand it's like super
light but wait till show you saw light I
let you put one tiny core on I love it I
always really light it reminds me of
kind of like a mess I suppose I'm just
going to go over again with my little
pencil last thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to quickly powder the center of my
face with my hyaluronic hyaluronic
hyaluronic just in the center of my face
so guys that is the finished look I hope
