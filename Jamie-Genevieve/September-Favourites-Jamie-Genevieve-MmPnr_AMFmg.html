record a video no I know but I'm so
gonna do it I'm not where you said no
bill I'm not man eternal well you sound
really good
no you wanna sabbatarian ready you wanna
cerveteri the video hi guys welcome back
to my channel i am not very well I am
sick as a dog I'm not well at all
but I've done what any normal person
would do and I go up I'm who's making
porn wait to work and over here and it's
not made me feeling there no kamae this
week what we're going to do something a
little bit definite we're going to do
our favorites video so I have gathered
wine for you eat my favorite product
from the last few weeks / month so I'm
going to call it my September future
favorites hello oh hey it's okay alright
so cou well so yeah oh no well mommy's
not well my let's just get started
because I'm gonna just talk about her
and really I'm all through the whole
video if I do it okay the first thing
I've got is aa skin care product from
watch obviously am i had my last shift
in last yesterday and I am sad I'm
really sad that I've left but I got all
this stuff before I left I spent about
150 pounds on bath bombs I don't have a
hundred fifty percent anyway this is a
cup of coffee a face scrub I cannot for
the life of me remember if I've already
imagined this and one of my other videos
but this is the base face mask / scrub
you will ever use in your tire life so
it is like I really runny
coffee sticky consistency yeah like it
won't even pull it out look at that like
what you do basically is I always use it
when I'm having a bath for the shower
and I'm washing my hair but can see if
you use this and you're not good washer
here you get a little bit of coffee the
whole way through your
it's bad but it smells very strongly of
coffee so if you don't like coffee try
and just power through and get it anyway
because it will change your life so you
go through the back through our you let
the steam can I work away at your skin
take off my makeup if you're not wearing
any makeup that spy instead of your face
of you like wrens and then apply this
smoothly all over your face obviously
mess it over the eye area leave it for a
great 10 to 15 minutes I would say
and then when you're taking it off it's
fully everywhere and it just makes your
skin blonde shady dude okay so there's
no nuts and ice it's a deacon product as
well in case you're vegan I am NOT a few
you may not know that I'm not vegan I'm
not vegetated either but I do like
blushes effects I like their le various
things I like that they're completely
against animal testing so it's a little
guilt free product and their size comes
in at about it twelve times fourteen
points what are those what are those two
I'm completely worth it you can also use
it you do not just need to use it on
your face you can use it on your chance
your are anywhere it's a piece of
automatic so you can just go home and
put it everywhere but this has
completely changed the way my skin looks
and feels my skin is clearer and
brighter nor is red my makeup sets on
it's so much better so everybody needs
that
okay next product I just got what I've
not done one of these before but I just
picked literally what my feelings are
right now so the next one is a perfume
this is Teddy
mug Miller authors don't know how to
pronounce it and Teddy Thierry Mugler
iliyan so I just I love it it's really
really really strong it's a strong
perfume I like my spare him to be quite
strong though I like them to have a real
space and to them I like the way to pair
a few lasts on your skin I like it when
it lasts on your clothes as well see I
was out the night before and I spray
this on my jacket and then the
a tragical and I can still smell it
that's why I like repair seems to be
like so this is order profound they also
do the toilet they also do our essence
which is really strong so this is my
perfume or choice at the moment and I am
a massive fan so the next thing we're
gonna pair from whole pack up and have
these spreads is quite an iconic pair if
you might think I think we all people
have tried it war net wheeler old I jazz
but me personally that's nice male great
though next thing is something for your
hair I dunno I do realize I'm not with
makeup yet but they're sleek beautiful
isn't it so I was just in London they're
doing makeup for our hair competition
the really change version unfortunately
we didn't win anything but we left
really really happy with what we've made
or created and we've had a great time
but one of the we're like eating Joe's
was looking after eyes I did a really
hot for the night and she gave me this
as we close out so this is the whaler
SP a little hair stands for luxe oil and
it's outwait oil but this stuff smells
incredible and the oil just picture here
super super shiny I've been using this
quill what I do as I just get my hair
are we messing the smell is just amazing
you need this anyway if you want nice
chain in here this is the last getting
care about I promise and then it's all
makeup stuff so that is something that I
honestly believe that every single
person should have and their position
this as coconut oil so I have started to
use this to take off my makeup everyday
so what you do is you just get a break
but that's nearly finished but what you
do is just get a nice decent hide fill
melt in your hands and then you
basically just melt your whole face are
we and then I use cotton pads soaked
with the last TG water which I've used
forever I use that same eye makeup off
and if I am gonna wash my face sometimes
I just leave it sometimes I just use the
coconut oil then I leave it
Cannell like oily and now hydrates the
skin and then sometimes I'll wash my
face with actual BIOS or Israel
I just think since I've started using
their my skin is a lot more hydrated and
cleaner as well I don't know why that
maybe it's the mix of this and the
coffee scrub up in USA but I've got
layers kind of little bumps on my skin
in any sports I do have go away really
easily because your high tree and the
dehydrated area and I just feel like
it's just worked wonders for my skin so
not only does on my face I think of
makeup but to hydrate the body Israel
hands knees feet elbows all the kenai
drier areas a lot about a decibel only
and whenever I use dead drop my dog will
actually not leave me alone he
absolutely loves that so I've been
actually mixing a little bit NS n with
his dinner so it's like totally
multi-purpose if you've got pets beat
them so coconut oil man I looked up
online because obviously you need to be
careful with dogs I looked up online of
coconut oils ok for Jerry Scheff rides
and it totally anything it's really good
for their heels and I know a lot people
that cook with those hey I'm not trying
to personally I'm even eros but using
something I use a skin care and my food
I think it's just the T sorb it will
just mean move like face cream and I
don't know how I feel like that but
coconut oil you can get it I got this
from Holden Barnett and it was half Thai
so to seven pounds for like the biggest
jerk ever and the improvement in my skin
personally
totally worth the seven bones next time
make up back over overall enemy cop
stuff and this is something I've used in
my tutorial before but I've been using
it kind of religiously since then and
it's a little nerve lot of glitches
again late quite a small branch from
early I don't know if that many people
know about them this is the velvet Lane
black plum B black little wrestling mats
I paid so and the Pegman is just
ridiculous is actually ridiculous so
what I've been using this for is when my
waterline I've got it my waterline see
I'll drag it down underneath and then
I'll smoke it over straddle and I just
feel like it's been lying to me all day
so instead of using gel later all the
time and my lower lash life I have been
using this pin so and I just think it's
super fab and I actually really like the
fact it's from a smaller
and really really regularly and all that
and the UK like Apple to that many
people talking about it I don't see that
many kind of goes in it and you're asked
the right ear if you've even heard of it
before but now even like if you see if
you go on their website how we look at
those shadows and stuff is real because
they are all prefab pretty fab quickly
on to the next one and their product is
tinted brow gel by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and I put the club chocolate so no
I have light hair I'm still doing my
plays just as soon as I don't have dark
here because I like a dark play with my
light here this is in chocolate which is
pretty dark but I have been growing my
eyebrows I'm going on holiday in January
and I just want to have a decent face
for a no makeup so I'm looking after my
skin I've blown my brows back and I'm
just excited to be can I have a couple
of weeks Chelle till I know it's not
having to draw I could blow every day
when I'm doing whatever natural brow if
you've seen my pictures on Instagram I
have you kind of students working
overnights don't play lately see you the
mornings just like a little better
they're still through your brows and at
completely uniform style maybe some
really really neat and tidy as long as
you kind of like pluck them or have them
Weis bleak as a week and and this stuff
gives you a beautiful color as well make
your eye very slightly darker so what
we're doing is I've been just like in a
through and leaving it for a natural go
if I want a slightly more bull diaper
I'll flip this through and then L can i
pencil in the end of the play and then
ever want to fill up great I'll do the
bow first and then put this through so
most of the time I've been putting this
to my face and consider it's nearly
finished
I just obsessed for that I got some
Beauty being for I think it was writ
1550 and see for the amount of time it's
lasted me golfer totally go for the next
product as a highlighter obviously and
this is the mini Luminizer hi
later by the bomb so the bomb is a brand
and American brand
it's come over to the UK you can find it
in your Debenhams store I think that it
is in the devlins I used to working in
when I went and I saw that they had that
I was buzzing so this highlighter is
just is butylene eyes it's a definite
finish to soft and gentle as well so
what doesn't work done today is I have
soft enjoyed a lot up but I put this on
top and it looking pretty severe and
Nestle and but and kind of natural delay
and just cutting about I go a couple of
compliments on my highlighter today
already and I just love it to bits so
you can see it from afar it's gorgeous
and what I like about it is real it is
slightly yellow to it so it's pretty
late I think you could probably get away
with us if you've got quite a late skin
tone but obviously I've got some time
today so I am loved or occur and I have
used the oil in darker skins as well but
that color I mean goodness just amazing
the highlight and go show package Angele
really cute kind of remains maybe an
effect don't know if a surprising at all
I think it's quite quirky it's quite
cute and this was only something like 16
pounds I think it was but love it I
think you get quite a lot of product as
well you don't need that much to get a
pretty severe defects oh jeez I love I
love last product and my favorite
schedule is the morphe 35w
eyeshadow palette so I actually bought
two of these palettes because I knew
that I would want one for me and one for
my kit
so that's tag and it's got everything
you need I completely love it so that's
a eye as far as my beer isn't kind of
like it's just a big huge Mutual's
palette is that the other one I got
which is the 35 in palette was Omar and
I did prefer old matte but the winner
kit for myself
has a couple of shimmery shadows in it I
created that I look I have on today
purely with this palette so I've been
giving it a really good call myself
underneath that I've just been
is in like Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
after use and a little bit of Kevyn
Aucoin
skin enhancer on my legs just the
tiniest little bit just to see kind of
how it works I do think the shadows have
really really neat peel off the follow
is a bit terrible there's a lot followed
so see if you feel like adding on to
your makeup after working all day don't
use this palette because it'll actually
go all over your face but if you are
like me and you came to cannot do your
eyes before your foundation I mean sign
the Pegman really really really good
I'll give you an idea I'll swatch this
one here which is what I've been using
the wall so I think but really good you
do need to build up a little bit so just
here it's slightly chalky or the makeup
geek which is probably my favorite
eyeshadow but the good thing about this
for over UK people I got this oil beauty
be for 16 pounds 16 pounds for a full
pallet so I don't know how these guys
speciated money but for that place
x-rays and see if you're just playing
around like I'm totally gonna use this
for Halloween makeup it's like just
practicing on myself
I'm not really that fussy see if I do I
can get a really nice finish and I'm
happy with overall look I will use
whatever so this palette selecting pones
how can you even argue without your I
mean you've got your light tones right
through the black but you've also got
your transition she's like your oranges
you've got your parents you're gonna
propose and you've got like a really
beautiful silver here which I've not
swatch it is not the best one thing I
would say about it is just remember that
you're only paying 16 pounds because I
create a I've created really a few
really beautiful looks and sour line
with us on clients and that's it like I
say this is the 35w Paulo so if you like
can I plead my mats and Shemer school
for this one if you like all matte looks
definitely go for the 35 in palette
that's what I've been using more of
absolutely said I want to say so good at
such good value for money
so you can get that on beautybay for Lu
UK folk for over us buttes fired
normally because you're so lucky to have
all the brands and all the ones to
choose from
well so guys that is my September few
days I only picked it because I am sick

film I thought and I am tutoring off the
