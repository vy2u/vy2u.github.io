week we are doing at number two of three
videos for glasses leaders so this look
today is much smokier answer sir so this
look is probably more suited towards
your evenings dinners naso whatever and
if you're more dramatic with your makeup
day to day totally really TV you know
why I like love all makeup on my face
all the time so I made this tutorial for
y'all that are like me and like
grandma's makeup and feel and create a
photo day today it's much smaller than
last time if you are looking for
something to be a bit more daytime I
will like my last video for glasses
below which is much more suited to
daytime and it's a little bit more
minimal it's not as strong me and
optical experience are thrilled with the
response from you guys already obviously
optical experience or a massive company
in the UK that deal with your glasses
prescriptions lenses and your laser eye
surgery Israel so we teamed up together
to bring you these sleep ideas
this is number two or three and stay
tuned if you would like to see how I
created this look okay I'd like to
apologize right now if you can hear drop
watching and watch bottle this is
favorite toy in the world starting off I
have done over makeup obviously apart
from this i and i have done my brows as
usual and brought the concealer don't
have it here
so i'm going to go in with and this
isn't actual products but it's a little
taster for that that took from my sal
one this is Ella my scar road jail and
Glenn saw it to look a really really
warm brown and I'm just going to use
that with an LM a sky shadow brush get a
little bit of that product and then
we're going to buff that on all over the
lids
know the reason that I love this stuff
so much is because and pretty much
waterproof once its own so it's really
good for no smudging
obviously something that's written
watchin Shh driver thank you
which is obviously something is quite
important when it comes next it I'm
going to go off you obviously when
you've got your eye shadow one most
important thing is so it will stay on so
that's why I like using this as a base
because it is so waterproof so I'm
having a sleep problem because this
product really dried out don't you steal
that brush a product that will flex a
tiny part as Judah Lane from Inglot one
little drop of this it looks like there
and this stuff basically I you can use
it to make a pose eventer away no but I
quite like just using it to make my
creams work again so for example this is
pure dried out so I'm just mixing a
little bit with that and it makes it a
lot more pliable sore when you're
putting it on it's a lot creamier so
like I use if my Jelena shadow or my
dead prized I don't just use this I
don't mix it worked in teens bathroom
anybody else use their pajama Bolton's
to clean their brushes I really hope so
because I like to need to wash my pajama
bottoms every time I do a cup and I've
just told you all that we're a pajama
bottoms when I'm recording uh-huh and
then what I'm doing just now is I'm
going in with ours aviva concealer
buffer but you still got some concealer
and I'm just blending that causes cream
it works a treat
I'm never too worried about it be in
uneven or anything like that because
this is just the base I'm going to go in
with eye shadow afterwards just to
mattify it down and obviously because
this is a look for glasses it has a bit
more demand thick like I said you want
it to be a little bit stronger but you
also want it to be really resistant and
all look some dark eye products can
increase in mil and that what son knows
I just used the same brush and I brought
up underneath my waterline and I'm going
to leave it just like that
okay so it's quite passed out then I'm
going in with beaches and cream by
makeup geek which is a really beautiful
transition shades I'm just going to use
that to diffuse and mattify the crease
to the bright blue because it's quite
light you can't really see it which is
winning that what you want
yeah that's smokey I'm going to thin
fine underneath very for the road you'll
cool now I'm going to go in with Coco
beer favorite warm brown shadow from
makeup geek and the brushes I'm using is
virtually just as we've all Lots softer
finer I think I use these brushes for
absolutely everything I love them and
I'm just going to use this shadow or and
the crease to darken it up a little
better and underneath the smoky ape and
again because we've got that gel
underneath this in budget this ain't
going nowhere so if you wanted to keep
it just on my eye you could just do
these things and then leave it and bring
the eyeshadow right on to the lid I've
left this part quite free cause now
we're going to use flamethrower by
makeup geek which is one of the foiled
eyeshadows and I'm just using an LMS cow
eyes shadow brush the reason I'm using
Illamasqua one is because they're
synthetic so they pack up like Shammi
oil shadows much better than fuel hair
brushes so I'm just going to put that
all over the lid oh my god I love it I
love it so much the reason I like doing
that is because when you look down you
get that shadow
so when you've got your glasses on it's
like a safe part up so it's quick
glamorous so it's totally readable for
any out and I'm just going back in with
eye shadow brush to kind of buff that I
ll if you don't have one of these
brushes you need one because see for
flicking away any eye shadow it's like
teeny tiny really fluffy fluffy brush
and I just get rid of everything it's
amazing and I actually started using it
for highlighter as well so this one is
just from Smashbox it's a fine brush but
yeah well that love it's everything on
fleek so I'm just blending that out
making sure it's nice and diffused
and now I'm going to go in with Mac
pencil in feeling what shows are really
beautiful black and because we've got a
dark
writer in the eye and jail I don't worry
about the smudge in too much is one
is your inner corners nice and matte
which you can do I don't why I write I
try and speak dungeon so I'm going under
the waterline and then i'm going to
tightline which is just the waterline
underneath your 12 lashes and then I
like these days bring in the eyeliner
just enter the tear duct which is
beautiful
come on man not today not today no I'm
going to go back in with my eyeshadow
brush and eyeshadow and cocoa bear and
I'm just going to bring that kind of to
the front
exactly smoke everything I for you
before it melts on your face cool
no I know the last video for glasses I
talked with my favorite mascara I bought
a new mascara and it's my new favorite
the new mark upward lash which looks
like a huge lipstick which I find
hilarious is amazing if I've got any
tips for this build-up one-quart nice
and thick can fill and then leave it
don't go over it because it was clumping
awful so the brush is tiny so it's
really good for bottom lashes and I'm
just going to work we get these nice and
long
the drama is just completely all there
isn't it with mascara is where I always
start with my top lashes then I'll do my
bottom with what's left on the brush so
it's not so clumpy I'm sure that
everyone does that by thought we're just
sheer perfect but I think that a really
simple easy makeup and again I'm one of
these people that where is my glass is
sometimes unity and I'll have Moss
Trinity so I like something dramatic
enough I can get me with it during the
day without my glasses
but when you put your glasses on then
these are different and lasting these
are at my skinnier frames and then when
you put your glasses on you still got
the drama and the depth of the eye
makeup that you did without the last
days so I think this is a fab look for
wounded partying
dinner it's just about more glam
thank you so much for watching case this
is number two or three videos for
glasses readers so stay tuned for two
weeks time where I have my last
installment we'll be doing a fill face
look with a different eye look but also
how to keep your foundational and with

is a nightmare and I just going to crack
away freer it still moves a little bit
but it doesn't move half as much as it

tricks so thank you so much for watching
