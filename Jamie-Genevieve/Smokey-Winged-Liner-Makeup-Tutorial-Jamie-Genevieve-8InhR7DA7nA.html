hi guys welcome back to my channel today
I am going to do a look that was barely
requested on my Instagram at Jimmy
Genovese kishna know and it was this
smokey went away now but instead of the
smoke coming right round the eye crease
Kanna is focused at my outside but it's
a very glam we do a smokey eye eye I
love it I've been doing it lately and I
think it's really flattering on every I
take this well you will witness me
having some way no problems in this
video but that is supposed to show
anybody has later problems sometimes
sometimes we get one good some things I
would Bennett safe on fire no one to use
again but we got other in the end and
that's what matters so I hope you guys
really liked this video and keep an eye
out for Lords of NEX
Awards videos because I am so lucky and
blessed enough to get through to the top
20 in the UK for the next Awards I can't
wait to get you guys to support me and
if I get through the next round I will
be looking for public ports or Palooza
for for me please I would absolutely
love that so you will be seeing an
unboxing video for me really soon and
you'll also be seeing the challenge
videos it will also be sealing in the
challenge videos the first challenge is
quintessentially British so I've got a
good idea but must leave for that and
you can check that out real soon if you
do follow me on Instagram or Facebook
you will see that I recently left my job
at Illamasqua
so that as me affiliate freelance artist
freelance youtuber Borger
right absolutely terrifying but I'm so
excited and hopefully you'll be seeing
more videos from me soon not just one a
week maybe two a week how does that
sound
I would quite like that if you haven't
subscribed already please do and I'll be
back next week with another with you
so I've done it my phobias let's praise
and when I only got this out to do and
we are using the Vegas lights palette by
makeup geek starting off with a lot of
airsoft or hurt all over the lid right I
give you a board and corny the board and
then I am using the color desert sands
from pallet with maids Weaver looks
softer Feiner
and I'm just going to use that on the
outer corner not overly severe we're
just gonna use that beneath and lay in
bed be it careful with this palette
because it is amazing meaning is hella
pigmented
and blend in that up towards the blue
and then I'm going to go in with the
color Mirage from the palette which is
like a really soft creamy color and
we're just going to the fill and her or
I will
starting off at the tear duct
and then I'm going to go in with the
color rule eight which is a beautiful
burnished raid-z Brown and we're just
gonna cool kind of over this desert
sands color
and now I'm going to go n where the by
debating color which is like a dark
brown and we're just gonna focus that
pigment right in the center of her
everything blends in so that's what's
gonna give us the depth just near where
the crease meets the wing and then I'm
going to do the under die so going on it
with my Luxor crease brush wise Weaver
I'm going to buff underneath their rule
a color and then a little bit at the
Badger bang
crazy eye on your face on the world
ideally do this before your foundation
because you took it it's like full loop
and then I'm just using a slightly
smaller brush - please / in the dark
brown color and now for the tricky bit
I am you saying that the illamasqua
precision egg which is my favorite
liquid liner it does last all day and
when you're washing it off that kinda
bobbles off so it's really easy to get
off bar it's pretty water resistant as
well so it doesn't kind of run or smudge
or anything like that so we're gonna
freehand this haha I can do this
I hear them away my hands are sweating I
don't know how this is going
I'm so jealous but I don't get a little
bit thicker anyhow and then a good trick
to tidy up your wing is to get your
concealer brush your angle brush from
going around your eyebrows and using
that just to sharpen this up and then
I'm gonna go back in with the shade by
the bank and just darken it up a little
bit more and I'm really focusing the
pigment right where I want it and then
just little soft strokes to buff that
out and you go go over the black just a
little bit but that's fine because you
can go over it again with filena and
then I'm just going over the line it
again good job and then a little
lation all that mascara obviously 12 and
bought my shares and the lashes I chose
to use are the lash Napolitan by sq door
bisque SP door and they're lovely their
main Chi lashes which means you can get
with you so of thumb I've had to trim
them quite your backs are nice and long
my eye sir
are you small get some glue on there
well that timing is perfect because my
camera just cut and who my lash is
nearly dry so better and place your lash
on
and I love these lashes because they are
so flirty it's like great oh the way I
may or may not have heard these on
yesterday we are meant to be used some
sort of a so a little bit of your liquid
layer and just go over the band Oh No
haha hey Dino oh that was terrifying
to fear
this is finish take madam

Newton and he's gone my mom just
