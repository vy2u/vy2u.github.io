today I'm going to show you how I've
been doing my rose
as of late so I've got quite a lot
compliments which is really nice thank
you very much on how I've been doing my
brows recently too when I've been
traveling stuff I've been doing my
process we really click pushing I think
that it's all the way I can describe
them they're just a lot fuller than
usual there may see they're kind of
undone and and I've just figured out are
we using the soap technique which I saw
for the first time off my good friend
Samantha
on snapchat she then passed me on to
pixie woohoo I think that the original
video on this and then I saw the days
appear consistently better video or in
this technique as well so there's more
than enough tutorials on the internet
for this technique but I thought I will
show you guys the way I do it just in
case it's a little bit different
different products or you just want to
see me do it so here it is
I hope you like it and if you like to
see how I do my brows with the soap
technique stay tuned hey guys today I'm
going to show you and we go from here to
here it's really pretty using I feel I
am like I said I've seen tutorials it is
absolutely everywhere but I thought I
would do my own just so you guys could
see so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to get my ass as you type
flow and medium brain drop bath you
you're making a vibe at the moment I
just work back funny I really key you're
so precious look at that it's the family
it's YouTube family
so all you need is your Debra or
anything like that so I use a color
medium brown at the moment and the brush
I'm going to use is my Smith 205 this
brush is incredible it's the smallest
little angle brush ever it still seeds
sort of teeny tiny and I just love it so
I'm going to go in with my product no
not too much
but what we're going to do first is I've
got my little Smith spilly as well
obviously you don't need a fancy spoolie
but if you use what everyday it's quite
nice to have a good one so I'm going to
brush through my brows I literally do
not trim my eyebrows anymore
I just let them go through so we're
going to start underneath
and then I'm just going to start
extending that bro a little bit because
I want that way and we have the same
thing on the top if you look this one's
quite overdrawn computer this one
and and fire already
okay so that's actually pretty much all
I do for killing my breath it looks kind
of saving symmetrical oh it's half
that's pain they don't get more product
and then I haven't touched the front of
the brow until now know what I'm going
to do is I'm going to use the straight
edge of my brush
and bring that down to the front and
then I'm going to use the flat side of
my brush just to brush that through the
ears
that's how you get it nice and seeded so
if you watched my previous brave
tutorials this is pretty much what I did
anyway the only difference is how I can
attain them with salt and you get too
much product I just get my spoolie and I
just kind of calm it through soften it a
little bit I was what Parrish and then
North I'm not really good much product
at all through here well I just showed
you my bad nail but not so see here this
is all free of products one where did
you know as we're going to grab my pears
soap and you can see my little place I
use my spoolie I am so lazy that I use
my avions because I never uses my face I
just I bought it for the sake of it I
think but I'm going to use this in this
little spot here so that's really Z I'm
the kitchen sink is directly behind you
and I get an up for nobody
okay and then this is my honest answer
number seven brush which I do still like
but only is it for this billionaire and
then I just get my brush and back and
forth back and forth back and forth
until you get what looks like this
and a call that pierced old froth so
once you post a pair so cross
you just brush it through the front of
your blow and you take your came and be
careful not to drag it to and pretty
much not touching the skin apart from on
my bray which is pain though to leave it
too much I just actually use my finger
get rid of the pure salt froth on telly
cotton pad and the reason we use pure
soap is because it's transparent and
that makes for the best result I feel
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit but I
just go through them and then once I'm
kind of happy with the shape I'll get my
finger not that one oh god I'm just
going to use it right I've lost money on
sores drop by accident I just kind of
push it down and then when it's still a
bit where I can move the heroes around
and then push it down again and that's
always the last all be it may be a wee
bit too extreme for you guys but what
you can do is you can trim your brow
hairs and they just do it with like
normal length right here is it but like
I said I leave mine see just cruel wild
and free because this is the breath and
at the moment isn't it and then to
finish off I will just use my Anastasia
brow gel the clear one and I'm just
going to do the tail of the plate follow
the way that the heroes are going at the
front and I actually do think that as
bridge Aylesworth care and I think it's
a lot better than any other clear brow
gel abused it's almost like thicker it's
like it lasts longer and these are the
brows I've been doing recently
yay brows done they're so nice they're
so nice I love it I love life so you
guys I hope you liked that quick
tutorial on how I've been doing my brows
lately ll people call this the Holi with
dry old people call us assault bride I
was called in my brows I deny this is
not me all the time I hope you like
studio air I will see anything
go on to him and you know don't you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
