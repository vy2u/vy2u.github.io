too hi guys welcome back to my channel
today I'm going to do a super easy braid
alas click so it's ideal for you lovely
ladies that I gave Maddie and maybe you
get money tabloids or you want to do
your makeup and you'd like a little bit
in school so that is just like a super
soft smoky eye with little B but Phoebe
Phoebe flex and and it doesn't get long
and it's so good so easy I think and I'm
using my new makeup geek eyeshadows so I
received beanies last week and I cannot
believe how good they are I completely
love the Pegman and the colors enemies
and and the places I actually really
affordable as well so as far as being
like a kind of like lore on the war in
how much then cause unbelievable
absolutely both so I'm gonna be using a
couple of these so choose s Luke and I'm
gonna do every sense I'm going to start
with my brows I'm gonna doll through
into my eye makeup they must go in and
then my lips as well so I hope you guys
like this video and learn something cool
and I will see you next week with
another one ah so starting off as usual
with my eyebrows I'm using thunder broke
it by Illamasqua a little bit way just
to sketch the tail of my brow using a
Mac 239 go brush I've sketched the
bottom line and now I'm just sketching
the arch of the brow just to join up to
a nice point once I'm happy with my
shape are going with Anastasio beverly
hills dipbrow pomade and chocolate and i
use this to fill at the front of the
brow because it's just that little bit
more natural the thunder broke it can be
pretty dark so it's good for sketching
out the teal but steer clear of it at
the front of my brow
the depo Pro meat is really good to get
any sharp Ladin to your blow as well as
that's the kind of look that you're
wanting to go for then I go in with
Kevyn Aucoin skin enhancer and SX all
for as usual with an angled brush just
to carve out the brows and make them as
super neat I completely understand that
this is not the typical look for a
braids ole but if I was afraid my
eyebrows would probably be stronger than
this again carving them out with
concealer just makes them look super
neat and tidy and it cleans up any mess
that you might have made for sketching
your blows out in the first place I like
to go on top of my blows wheel just to
highlight the browbone connect in total
and then I a boolean data afterwards but
feel free just to carve out underneath
and then going in with my makeup
addiction cosmetics brush a concealer
brush just to blend that concealer it a
little bit on the top and the bottom
this makes for a really good transition
base as well and then just to finish the
glaze off a little bit of the braid
shield by anastasia beverly hills and
chocolate as well this stuff just makes
them look super neat and tidy and make
them stay in place all day Gordon with
soft ochre by Mac because I do think
it's one of the best eyeshadow primers
and I'm just using that all over the lid
blendin up towards the concealer and
underneath the lower lash line as well
going in with my makeup geek
I'm gonna left all these don't below for
you guys I'm using the lightest shade
just as my transition shoes I'm going
and decrease with that one and just
blends in area using a fluffy brush from
zoeva and then I'm going on with a
deeper warm brown color this is going to
be my crease color so I'm going on with
the crease brush from makeup addiction
cosmetics and then blending out with the
fluffy brush again just to get that nice
diffused smoke this one's not going to
be too dark at all going back in with
that warm shade and actually splash a
little dolmens brush I'm just going to
go right under the lower lash line to
give some drama and then going back in
with the later she just to blend that
out going on with one of the new crushed
metallics I am using that all over the
lower lid and and the tear doctors will
just to open up the eyes going on with
infinity gel liner from Illamasqua my
favorite Jelena
I'm going to give myself just a small
defined flicks and I'm using the Ziva
liner brush for this if you struggle get
in the teal of your flick Mason Street
last week's video was on the liner so
you can have a little look at that if
you're struggling with your liner if you
want to have a little practice with some
tape
going on with next jumbo pencil in milk
just to give the lower water line about
greatness and just the Urban Decay black
curling mascara just a couple of quarts
because we're going to be putting false
lashes on anybody these are Eldora false
lashes my favorite lash company by far
I'll list the style that I've used below
and I like using a Peter tweezers just
to get them nice and close to the lash
line now we got onto the skin I've
prepped my skin with the B sex play by
urban decay and I'm using skin base and
eight-point-five all over and I'm using
the makeup addiction cosmetics is
stifling brush fillers once I have a
nice even layer on my face I'm going to
spray the Beauty Blender with a bit of X
plus from Mac and I'm just going to be
to blend my entire face this is my
favorite step to foundation just because
I do think it lasts that much longer and
if it's your wedding day obviously
you're gonna want your makeup to last
all day now I'm going in with dark tan
bronzer by Mac and my Weaver contour
brush highlight brush and I'm just
warming up the face a little bit I'm not
going crazy with my corner because again
this is made to be played to look a
little bit softer and just beautiful
when it comes to getting photographed so
focusing on the cheeks as usual but
bronze in the parameter of my face as
well this is a makeup geek blush I will
name that the law just to add a little
bit of color to the cheeks for the
change and then going on with soft and
gentle by Mac kit favorites product and
just highlighting gently as well again
not using as much as I usually do just a
soft highlight a little bit on the
Cupid's bow
was kinda sexy let's take my Mac and I'm
just a plain Street from the villa on
some ellipse this is the matte lipstick
so it will last you that little bit long
ago and then gone with the Rimmel dark
brown pencil my new favorite trick for
lip laning I find that this last
definitely the longest out of all that
bleh knows I've tried and it gives you
the definition that you're looking for
it but it also blends really nicely and
then given your lips a good drop
together just to make sure there's no
lightens going on with a generous
helping of the littlest powder by
Illamasqua just to say everything and
make sure it's not going to move and
that is the finished look I hope you
guys liked it and I will see you next
week with another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
