hi guys welcome back to my Channel today
I'm bringing you a tutorial so this is
public I did a couple months ago and I
asked on Twitter my Twitter user name is
Jimmy underscore Genevieve and I asked
ons for our what do you guys want to see
because sometimes I don't know what to
do so when I asked a few of you asked
for this look from available and it's
you're saying the Charlotte Tilbury
docility palette and I'm using a couple
of new little techniques I picked up I
have a couple of the new makeup geek
matte shadows as well so this looks kind
of perfect for New Year's Eve obviously
which is today so happy to use e to
everybody happy Albany and yeah if you
guys here I create this look so stay
tuned should probably turn off some
sensation yes oh man I should have
cleaned okay I'm going to start off
we're soft okra as always but my self
talk is actually dried up so I'm going
to put one drop or Judah line by Engler
which is basically like a kind of mixing
medium and it just brings the product
back to life so I like using there's
where gel liner back Kim
pin pours using it where anything can a
liquid and you can also use it I'm going
to use it later don't show your
different ways so I'm just going to put
one drop in there and I'm just going to
mix it with my little brush I just kind
of reactivates it so you get you can
actually finish your product because
he's always flat and dry hope all the
time all the time okay so I'm just using
a layer all over my eye and underneath
as well so I'm going to start with the
shade that claimed really it from makeup
geek and I'm just going to use my Smith
2 3 2 brush to pop that base on so this
is more like a base shadow and I'm just
going to use it to map out where my
support Lee is going to go and also
tomorrow
a little bit I like to user kind of say
to the brush just to get the feed up to
the brow and obviously I've already done
my braids I've done them a little bit
stronger than usual as well and to go
with my new here I've got darker roots
so afford to go a little bit darker a
bit bolder and when I was a blondie
okay once you've got that kind of
starting to look good and this is one of
my fav looks because you can be a little
bit mean serum this is quite a grungy
look anyway I'm going to go straight in
with Amira carnal which is a really
really dark shade that's one in the
makeup geek shadows as well
and one of the new matte shades is what
I use it all the time
I've sort of loved it especially with my
hair this color it just seems to go
really nice I'm just going to use the
same brush there I'm just going to pack
that one in the coroners Natalie just
use the small movements and say to say
just to get that starting to blend
upwards and wiggle right in my inner
corner as well
and I'm going to change my brush and
we're going it with the tooth fairy
brush from Smith as well and I'm going
to go in with the same shape and wiggle
right underneath my eye get that smoky
get that smoky oh now we're going with
just a fluffy brush from makeup
addiction and I'm just going to kind of
start to blend out the brush I used with
my soft ochre and when you go back and
with that just to soften the edges
because it's got a little bit of peeing
port on its tail it's got a little bit a
soft ochre on it as well it just kind of
helps blend everything into my
foundation I'm going to go in with the
blends brush again and I'm going to go
in with the dulce Lita palette from
Charlotte Tilbury is one of my favorite
palettes the only thing is it's all
shimmer so that's why I'm using my
makeup geek mattes and I'm going to use
this they can add some shimmer so I'm
going to go in with the shade here and
the fluffier brush and I'm just going to
connect the eye in the middle and I'm
going to blend out underneath as well
then we learn with crop shadow by makeup
geek which is just black I'm going to
use tiny little morphe in
seven brush just to pack on the black on
the outer corners of my eye and inner
corner
now we're to go in West they're slightly
darker shades and the Charlotte Tilbury
dual savita palette and I'm just going
to kind of blend that black out a little
bow with a look like that you're kind of
constantly going back and forth kind of
cleaning up as you go
blended into the foundation I'm just
gonna use this brush to connect bring
this kind of wing I know I made a
mistake what may great I'm just gonna go
in and finish what I'm doing
then we're going my fit and go gel liner
and I'm just gonna intensify this look a
little bit by adds in the gel liner to
my bottom lashes button lightly bottom
lash line and then I'm just going to
wiggle the brush in between my lashes
just to make sure my lower waterline is
completely pitch black but that's
obviously one of my favorite things to
do in the whole entire universe now I'm
going to go in with this mesh at 220 bro
smash smash we went with the Smith 220
brush and I'm going to wear with the
came out warmer color here and I'm just
going to use that brush on its side
underneath my eye just to blend out that
black and I'd like to thank Samantha for
each one or two uses brush I'm going to
do it the same with the black shadow I'm
going to go back in with the angle Judah
line and I'm going to get a little
dropper and I'm going to pop it on top
of this a gold shade its dropping all
over my leg so I'll go put one drop on
top of the gold shade and the Charlotte
Tilbury palette and when you use just to
get a small smudge oh oh is that and I'm
just going to use follow my dad just
came in that I'm just going to finish
filming and so you can hear my dad
Raceland drop in the right range but
they're best friends so I've put the
Judah lane just on this kind of Goldy
shades and I'm going to use this little
eyeshadow brush just to kind of mix it
together until it's like almost like a
paste and then I'm just going to pop
that or in a spotlight of my eye and
this shadow is you're really funny
texture to use by itself it's one of
those ones it looks amazing and they
palate but it doesn't really swatch the
same way it's up to you you can kind of
pack it on top of our primer if you like
but I just think this is the the easiest
and quickest way to get rid of the next
result oh I love it
now I'm going to use the lightest shade
in the pilot just to highlight my
browbone so I'm just going to use a
little eye shadow brush just to do that
and then just gonna help bring the
highlight to join on to my actual
highlight and it also helps blend the
eyeshadow up a little bit so I mean it
stops it from being too much I love that
then I'm going to go in with the L'Oreal
intense black super liner this is just a
super easy it feel typically you know
and I'm just using that to get a nice
later at the top of the lid just like
that
Oh club a little bit what you'll and I
just kind of fins that eye alright I'm
just gonna go back into the kind of
warmer shade in the door city to palette
just to come out soften it edges a
little bit I think that's me done so I'm
just going to go put a move that mascara
and lashes on and I will be back to show
you what it looks like at the end and
that is the finished look so guys that's
a video it's done I hope you like this
tutorial

really love the Charlotte Tilbury
palette or it's nice to show you
something new that I've found happy new
