we are going to do look using the new
naked ultimate basics palette so I went
to California with urban decay and I
worked with this palette before it was
launched so I've had it for a little
while
but I thought it would be great to show
you guys the parallel and what I think
if you already just going crazy if you'd
like to see how I created this look
agent let's get started
so I'm going to go in with lame-o paint
pot by Mac is the warmer color of the
paint pots I really like it cause I like
our warm smoky eye so it's just a really
good base a little bit is enough not too
much you don't want it to be too creamy
that everything is going to start moving
around that would be bad then I'm going
to go in with the naked ultimate basics
palette which is a fill time stunner
and we'll go in with a mix of the two
lighter shades here with my Smith 232
brush just to mattify all over the lid
then I'm going to go in with the shade
commando which is here mixed with the
shade faith here just as my transition
color these eye shadows obviously it's
all math the whole palette is all matte
they are the same formula as the old
matte shadows from the urban I'm going
with my 2 to 4 brush from Mac just with
the shade commando just to can I help
blend oh yeah these are the old formula
which is great because the March shades
in the old pallets are fab but I think
these are better
I'm so convinced these are honestly I'm
obsessed with this pile I could use
every day every day I'm going to go end
up with the shade extra better buy my
brush which is obviously my favorite
shade and the whole parlor is the most
beautiful warm rust color and I'm going
in with my Smith 247 brush just in the
crease
I'm looking go into my meadow so I can
see exactly where my Croesus in and I'm
just cannot placing that color right in
the crease and then I'm going to go back
in with my mag two to four and a shade
commando again just to help blend those
edges and I'm really late handed with
this brush because I'm just took
tickling the sides tackling aside to
that shadow now I'm going to go in with
the shade here I can't read it because
it's back to front we're going to one
with this shade with a little bit of
this shade and then we're going to
darken it up with this really dark
purple here and I'm just going to go
underneath my eye and we're going to the
 extinct instinct which is the color
more perfectly transition shade excuse
those I've got a sport and nothing will
stick to it now I'm going to go in with
my Weaver two to four brush em and
Ishida lethal which is a darkest purple
color and it's going to escape that
under my eye right under the lash line
to get dip good super smoky I'm just
using the brush right on its side so the
pepper the brush is just sketching on my
lash line and then the rest of the brush
you're just going to help in that blend
it downwards I'm going to go in with my
two to four and a little bit of the
shade extra better which is that really
beautiful rust color and I'm just going
to intensify the color on my lid you can
see how good the pigment is I'm so
excited about it
and when you're going with - we go two
to four again and just with whatever is
left over on the brush from using the
dark color I'm just going to intensify
the crease right at the crease and no
more just a little bit right in there
nice I'm going to swap my palette over
to the moondust by urban decay and we
are going to go in with this shade here
it is called lithium and if you haven't
swatch this year I really recommend you
try them they are so different to the
other Minda shadows the pigment is in
tune and I'm just going to go in with my
middle finger and I'm just going to pack
that onto my lid I mean come on
now I'm going to go back in with is
Weber two to four and I'm just going to
intensify the police one last time and
get rid of any of the followed any other
dust that's kicked up by that moon dust
eyeshadow I'm just going to use my
powder brush to wipe away the excess
obviously I did my friend ation for us
today and yeah good now Grady if you do
your foundation first as long as your
powder underneath your eye then it will
be fine it shouldn't stick to anything
I'm using a cream highlight today's I'm
just going to touch that up and we're
good to this school I'm going to go in
with the lightest shade here just as
that inner corner highlight and matte
inner corner highlight thank Jack's
woman now I'm going to go in with my Kat
Von D liner as a list and we're going to
do a kind of thinner line so it's not as
thick as my usual I'm going to start
sketching on the lash line
for mascara I'm going to use the fatale
volume million lashes from a lawyer
I think this mascara might be my new
favorite it is super stretchy so it's
six of lashes greatly and and it's
really good for Baltimore ashes which
I'm a final the only thing I don't like
about it is that it is difficult to get
off which is not a problem but if you're
lazy like me then it can be the lashes
I'm going to use are these mink lashes
from Sudhir lashes I can't remember what
state of the art but I'll link the
website below so you can have a little
look and I've wore these a few times so
there are well blocking in I'm going to
use my dual blue paint on various and
excuse the mess I don't think however be
able to keep lash glue tidy and I'm just
going to let them sit to dry okay I'm
going to go in one last time with a
little bit of the lethal shade mixed
with h2 better just right in my crease
I'm just convinced it's not as dark and
then I'm going to blend that out with
just the extra bit of shade by itself
and then to highlight my brow I'm just
going to go in with the Tarte
highlighter and xposed with a little
Smith brush this is the two five six
brush I'm just going to call right on my
browbone I've used it tightly and a few
but the other thing I love it it's not
as highlight E is I usually am but see
for a more subtle highlight on my like
brow bone and down the center of my nose
and stuff I think it's great and then
I'm just going to apply my lash looking
down and terminer
if the concealer remains and that's
finished like
I think I like this look so much because
the palette is obviously daylight I
really really care I think that there's
a good mix of shades here and see these
warm colors and there's enough she is
going to deepen up the crease and things
the only thing that I maybe would see is
that there isn't as many darker Browns
which is what I would usually reach for
there's nothing wrong with that
obviously it has made me kind of venture
more into the grays and the caner
purples and things but as a texture and
pigment and peel I just am a huge fan I
hope you liked this tutorial and I'll
see you next thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
