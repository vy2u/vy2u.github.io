week we are going to do a tutorial and
yesterday I asked what can make up you
guys with lake this week I then tried to
film this tutorial yesterday but you
ever have those days for him if he
helped us go to a little I had a really
really bad day today so I seriously
better doing it today is Wednesday and I
did summer glam makeup for you so this
is something it's gonna last long in the
skin and it's not gonna melt with the
heat and it's a little bit later than my
usual kind of makeups
it's not hard to do you don't need that
many products perfect for summer you
were lucky enough to be good on holiday
I'm using for going it for dinner or if
you're going to like a club abroad or
something like that it's something
that's gonna last and look quite
glamorous with a old hassle thank you
guys so much for your support in the
next war it's been unfortunately I did
not make it to the top ten but I am
already looking forward to other things
I've got a lot of things going on and
exciting things to come I hope you guys
like my take on a summer can I make up
and you can join me next week for more
tutorials and you'd like to see I create
this like speeches starting off I'm
grabbing some Elizabeth Arden advanced
effects primer this stuff has been tried
and tested and it's amazing I'm just
using my real faith Real Techniques
pointed foundation brush to apply the
only better makeup at an old lady is my
eyebrows and I've done them a little bit
thinner than usual cause it's summer my
stuff is so good it just takes away any
kinda discoloration in the light
mattify is everything down very
different my shadow palette I've decided
to use as the zoeva rose golden palette
super super cute I just realized I
hadn't done it that's what do you miss
it yeah and I absolutely love it so
starting off where the matte cream color
called luster and I'm just doing a
lovely dusting of that an address using
that and
creates with my fluffy Eva branch as a
transition shade a transaction shade is
basically just the lightest color and a
smokey eye and you use it first so
you're not going straight and with a
dark color because that doesn't work it
makes a maze so I'm buffing that and all
don't die and this is a good look for
some art because it's not too heavy it
doesn't see it to love them and it's
really long waiting so if you're
somewhere sunny it's not gonna fold all
over your face and then I'm going
straight and with the other matte shade
wonderful and it's just a nice matte can
I charcoal e Brown I'm using a little
Mac brush that I got an essay but it's a
two to six if you buy them anymore
by any crease brush will do we're just
gonna pop that in there and underneath
is will notice as well that when
blending above my eye I've got my brush
up here and when I'm bleeding underneath
I keep it flat this just helps the blend
much smoother going back in with my soft
brush just to smooth all that out and
then I'm just using a teeny tiny pencil
brush just to darken up the crease a
little bit
I'm just gonna use an LMS qey black
pencil
this one's called Sophie I'm gonna
choose back right along the waterline
and now for the fun bed I'm using the
color reflective elegance which is a
really nice pinky gold I'm we're just
gonna press that right in here
and I'm just mixing a little bit of the
shield foil which is whatever champagne
add a bit of mascara and mascara I'm
using is the urban turkey super cuddle
cuddling mascara I am not usually a
massive sign of like mascara in general
like I've never found one that I thought
was amazing but I'm gonna go in a buy
this and fill science because they're
just a sample I love it
okay the cause this is just the summer
look I'm just gonna adds on a little
half lash so it looks just like this and
it sets at the end of your lash and it's
really really flattering with it being
too heavy and they're super easy to put
on and you can't you can't feel them at
all so really use them
these are Eldora hitch 1 5 2 s l
daughter of my faves and that's the eyes
done another thing for the face
I have already it cleanse my skin with
coconut oil and then I used tici spray
from lush on cotton pads and then took
all that off and that's what keeping my
skin pretty much cleared ain't no I was
suffering from really bad red rice is
the workers of wherever I touch my feet
just gets worse most Myers so what I do
to start a fix plus by Mac a generous
dose it's actually lost in here if you
can believe Scotland's meant to be like
29 degrees to do look how much that
affects my redness already and seen more
my concoction LeBlanc Chanel primer I
have the Phil one of those but I donated
it to my kit for on my lovely clients so
I'm loving off sachets rate no and
little ports that I fill up for myself
so what I do with that stuff is you
don't need much of this at all that much
quite a thin layer just a little bit and
then your foundation of choice so if
you've watched any web videos you'll
know that my favorite foundation
it's gonna be by Illamasqua I tried I've
said everything and scan bees just seems
to be the thing that works but it works
best for my skin so you don't need as
much as you usually would I'm gonna give
myself maybe 2/3 support usually use
we're gonna accept it together so I've
got my Real Techniques expert face brush
and I'm actually just gonna mix those in
the back of my hand and the play merit
will give a really really nice chewy
finish but it will make it long last and
because it's primo and the fun
additional could be cockroach everyone
is on their sleep sleeping forever
I know what its name sometimes you just
don't want that here behave the
cartridge week I'm all fit nurse I'd see
that bad day much strokes and path thing
where you need more coverage we're not
too worried about it finish ain't no
though because we're gonna use a Beauty
Blender
don't know that we've done that I'm
going to take my Flex class again I go
through a lot of this stuff and spree my
beauty blender till it's damp and then
I'm going to go over all
and the play mirmix of the foundation
just shares a trait I and doing that
step just pushes that into the skin
the fix+ helps hydrate your skin and
just give you an overall Julie look
without it being oily and it was
introducing life Thunder because if this
is somebody look I'm not going to bother
with any kind of heavy concealers or
contours so I feel like the foundation
brought up to my smoky eye has given me
enough coverage so I'm just gonna go
straight into my new Mac BB cream this
is prepping flame BB Beatty bomb dark
deep so I'm going straight and a super
dark I'm going straight and with my
Beauty Blender and we're just gonna add
some warmth to the face and because it's
a beauty balm thank like she original
Universal blondes are about half the
place and are actually really nice and
dark I'm just buying saying blends are
along with skin no crazy contours or
anything literally just a little better
warrants on the cheek and that sucks
amazing to have because if you do get a
ton on holiday you can just buff a
little bit over your foundation just
make it overall quite dark
it's great from sticking to the whole
sorry theme I'm not going to use a blush
I'm going to keep all the color on my
lip
so I'm going to keep it quite prone to
injury and fresh but I'm going to add my
new product but you only got yesterday M
NARS albatross highlight so I don't
believe it and half the spinnerets
amazing so late so I'm using my
Illamasqua highlighter brush and I'm
just gonna fire that on my cheekbones
here
if it's bought it must turn the nose
like a little bit just here even though
we're on holiday one thing that you're
always going to need is sinking prayers
are a little better Satan prisoner on a
fluffy brush and brush gonna dust that
all over perfect came for lips I'm
fighting that saying I'm not gonna turn
it up to YouTube Facebook
let's do red and now we're gonna do lips
usually I go through neglect but see
let's to read so it's starting off more
like I know this is Mac let playing out
and kiss me quick and I always like I
talk when I'm doing that otherwise I'll
mess up
and a sweet - wow I'm mostly squint when
I talk a nice way to clean up any kind
of lanes is to get your angle brush and
when you did your brows and just cannot
clean up just like that and that makes
me to check if you are happy with me
even enough like me myself I know that
my lips are not even whatsoever so I do
a little paper all right smile and if
you're happy with the way that the
Cupid's bow comes up and the way that
look can extends down the bottom then
you are a desk or you're already this is
the finished look I hope you guys like
it perfect for summer perfect for
holidays perfect if you just so happen
to live somewhere nice and I will see
you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
