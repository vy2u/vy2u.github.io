this week I'm going to bring you
something special when I was in Thailand
at the beginning of the year I were a
certain type of makeup most of the days
and I got a lot of compliments and a lot
of requests for tutorials so this is my
recreation of that look and it is super
simple skin that like that lasts a long
time and I really quick and easy Mac
smokey eye and yeah it's really really
simple
it contains notes to Norfolk so it's
really easy to create and that's what
video is brought to you because of me
and interpreted are working together key
and it's winter playhead is a
shopping-center really close to here I
live in Glasgow and I go there all the
time probably too much so entering heads
have supplied all these products from
shops that they've got in-house and
you'd be so surprised at what you can
get in places like Marks and Spencers
boots except for etc I've hand-picked
these products myself and I've been
using them for last couple weeks and I
am super impressed so I hope you guys
liked this video and if you'd like to
see how I created this look stay tuned
okay so first thing I'm going to do is
I'm gonna grab my
Stila soul palette so this is at be able
to fill a shadow pilot it's a really
nice mix of matte and shimmer shades and
if I could I'm gonna go for is this one
here it's a really nice can i warm up
transition shades and i'm going to put
that all in the crease and i've already
prepared my eyeball with i primer any
eye primer will do and I've used the
lightest shade in this palette lately
all over my legs just to mattify
everything down I feel like it can that
eyeshadow goes one much easier when you
have a nice matte beads just use in can
a wonder and little
can arrange movements to build that
color up there I recommend using their
kind of fluffy brush for this and it
just seems to deposit the color a lot
better next I'm going to take this color
here which is there in a darkest Brown
mark shade in the palette and I'm going
to press that all over the lid with a
small firm eyeshadow brush
and bringing that color all over the lid
and up to the crease which is through
the transition shade starts and I'm also
going to bring this color underneath the
eye as well once that color is own what
you can do is you can mix the warm shade
the transition shade and the matte lid
color together and we're going to use
those to blend the lid color into the
crease color the pigment these
eyeshadows is a crazy sinners so let's
do up is an American brand but you can
get them and boots and box in spencer's
I'm going to slightly blend underneath
as well which for those who shoots on
you can grab any kind of liner I'm going
to use a fill type in this case and I'm
just going to put a really nice thin
line on the top of my lashes just with
or something from my lash to stick on
top of
okay I'm going to use the small dense
brush and the black matte color this my
black eye shadows got really good
pigment to it I'm going to slightly buff
that underneath my lower lash line and
when it slightly small coat that laying
it on top just in the corner no just
stick a coating of mascara on the lashes
I've pecs are so nice they are Eilert
textured lashes in one57 and they are
super wispy and double layered so I'm
just going to put some glue on these
when I make that go to dry I'm going to
go in with this color here this is a
really nice can I add a day since
shimmer color and I'm going to use a
little firm brush just to apply that on
my brave one
and my Ella corner no all they have to
do is wait for this last tray and then
when you're applying your lashes make
sure that you've let the glue dry for a
good 30 to 40 seconds drive up a mirror
and hold it just under your face like
that and pop on easy is that okay now if
I all that lash is drying let's move on
to skin I prefer to prepare my skin with
a moisturizing tremor and now I'm going
to go in with the wire sail Toshi claw
em hope you like my French accent
they're the foundation and I'm using the
shade BB 60 which is dark but if you
look at my chest and my arms I am quite
Brown at the moment in when I tan I
don't have my face I like to use my
foundation to match it to my face
so I'm going to use my favorite
foundation brush you can use any kind of
buffing brush for us and I'm just going
to go ahead and look Lila so I like to
start in the middle of my face and work
my way out and I'm not using today be a
coverage obviously this tutorial is
based on a lip tied
I was in Thailand earlier on in the year
and yeah and then we're too much we cook
when I was there I'm the more tanned I
got the last foundation of war so I'm
just going to use a little bit just now
just to can I even ate my complexion and
match it to my body I've been wearing
this foundation for the last week or so
and someone every day at least every day
one person has asked what I'm meaning
because my skin looks good so that to me
screenings positive review and I'm just
going to born over all the way areas of
Mathis and because it is a little bit
dark and I'm just going to blend it down
my chin to make sure there's no lines
once my foundation is pretty much on I'm
going to grab my next product which is
Double Wear concealer I swear that's all
the time when I'm is a bar bar and when
I work fixed laws are but you can get in
Boots and I wore this all the time I
don't know why I've stopped I'm so good
so I'm just going to apply that kind of
underneath my eyes then the center of my
nose and on my forehead so because I am
so dark when I can and I later can
actually this light on my face with a
concealer so once I've got that in my
face I'm going to go back in with my
foundation brush which has got some
excess foundation on it and I'm just
going to buff that in oh it's so good
and I like to use the foundation brush
just to get nice and high up near the
eyes and just make sure there's no
cannot mating us under my eyeshadow
so once the concealers on we are going
to dive straight into bronze there so
this is another stealer product is the
steel deep lines are and light and it
sounds like it's pretty dark I think
it's a really nice color for me when I'm
tan so I'm just going to use this and
I'm going to use my bronzer and I kind
of three shapes or standar the forehead
right into the cheeks and then under the
jaw
once you've got your bronzer on the next
product which I'm pretty excited of it
is in a Topshop product so one of two
actually this a is a gloss and really so
when I first saw that I was like for an
earth is this it's crazy it's a dark
highlighting powder but what I thought
would be nice and is is to use it for on
top of my blonde joke so I'm going to
use a little bit and just going to show
you how Google is this just gives a
really nice radiance to your skin in
with her to be in like to white it's a
really nice alternative for blush I
coming up to a kind of spring in summer
if you want to rock that goal we can
look in this stuff's perfect I have it
above and then I'm just going to kind of
touch lately the high points of my face
or like my forehead here and I'm just
using a fan brush for that super glowy
and brown next product as a new favorite
of mine this is the Chanel universal
loose home though it says perdre
universally bitter by I can't speak
French and it's the shoe therapy so it
does have a lot about color to it but
it's just a really beautiful M
translucent powder i saw stunning
underneath the eyes which is exactly
what i'm going to use it for so to keep
everything how you dirt underneath I'm
using the tiniest little bit and then
I'm going to use a little bit just at my
smile lines and in between my brows just
when I tentacle oily or my face tends to
move a little bit more than it should so
that is become a new staple favorite and
my personal makeup and my kept makeup is
well for work the next product I'm going
to use is another Topshop product and it
is the glow stick so this is another
highlighting product that I am obsessed
with and it's gorgeous it's on
a clean product which I don't usually
use but for summer and spring I just
can't wait to be honest when I go on
hold in X or a business and desert brush
and I'm just packing the product on top
of my brush and I'm going to press that
onto the skin where I want highlight so
everywhere
hmm no cheek bones and if you use this
press in motion the cream would left any
of the product underneath so we're just
going to start on top of the skin and it
just looks so it's like the petting me
of jewy it's just so beautiful I think
the reason that people get off these
kind of product is because I'm really
not sure how to use them but if you just
get synthetic brush they can't do it and
place on I the glue is real my friend
and I'm just going to use a little bit
on my Cupid's bow and it died in my nose
as well
I mean imagine that and the center of
your legs oh the best nice so easy so
quick and in photographs it shows up so
nicely and okay next product is oldie
but goodie is the lush bubblegum lip
scrubs or I just get a little bit my
finger I apply to my lips and then mmm
is like a write-off these three things
are amazing these fully any kind of dead
skin its life on your lips and they
prepare your lips for any kind of
lipstick will it appear satin or a
liquid lipstick or a matte lipstick it
just gives you a really nice beat I'm
going to quickly blot down my lips with
a little bit of foundation just to make
sure that they're nice and light because
the lipstick I'm going to use is quickly
so all I do is it's going to go over the
edges and it are still nice and smooth
and the lights like I'm going to use is
the Lancome Rouge 250 which is such an A
Scanner rosy Newt and for summer this is
something at the Crayola
I just threw on my lipstick with no lip
liner and I actually really like it so
what I'm going to do that right now
it's somewhat fresh and nice when you're
on holiday obviously thinking kind of
where they can come off this way your
lexical we're really really nicely and
I'm just gonna slowly feed to your
natural look color rather than get and
patchiness from liquid lipstick sorry
like that so that is the finished look
you guys I hope you like that and if you
like this makeup I hope to see y'all
rocking it on them sunny locations you
know thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
