we are doing something a little bit
different I am going to do the tattoo
tag and this is something I've been
asked to do a few times I see a few
about hundred and I don't know why I
just didn't ever think I would ever do
it by in here I am
what are you doing to show you guys my
tattoos and that's pretty much it I had
a fear of you so I'm not going to go to
India at all and if you want tattoos
great if you don't like them you don't
need to watch this don't worry about it
I won't find you a 100 a you can just
click off and that's totally fine I did
not really go about it the right way
some mate see hey I started getting a 50
on so that's it worked out frame for me
but I don't recommend going get them if
you're under 18 back when I was 15
it was a long time 123 no I managed to
get tattoos pretty on the little thing I
called fake ID which I made myself and
it wasn't even really ID it was actually
a card with my fall and my name but you
made it yourself
and I just put 1980 and the thing and
everyone believed me so yeah first
tattoo I ever got was new little birdie
guys on my back so I was 15 and I went
to my mom and dad I was no I went to my
mum and I was like mom I really want
this tattoo I had a picture of these
birds and she said to me if you still
want it in six month time then you can
go and get it so I waited six months and
then I shorter the picture again I was
eight I still want this cat food and she
says okay no problem on you go thank
hang no one would tattoo a 15 year old
she was wrong because the dead so yeah
that's my first tattoo and I think
that's a really decent price at which be
honest because I still really like it um
and a baby three or four years after I
would have done that my mum actually got
it traced and she's got up and I have
other children so we are connected the
next act I got was kind of embrace all
my supremacy death oh I'm covering my
toes up because I've done my fake time
not very well myself so right here
like an IV design and in the right and
it says this set which is stranger 17
which is my lucky number
and I actually got the layers first to
know where they are I got that right in
first and it was so weird by itself and
then I went to in Steven ugly I was ooh
me and heated my IV when I was 17 so I
wasn't really like that suit but I go
out of mana made Steven ugly I do me he
is my tattoo I explain what he's done
most of my tattoos and there's a couple
I don't have the earth I don't either a
lot from him but he is who's done like
my sleeve and my hands and things like
that
the next Saturday with a gig the next
tattoo was this bracelet which was right
right - and it's got a little present
moon that comes off it um I just love
moons my mum again she is quite a
spiritual being and she thanked and I
agreed that the moon has a lot to do
with the way we feel and yeah Tibet
wacky but I believe it I think the moons
are super powerful thing on this planet
will not honor on it but yeah I really
like it as you can see in here the
feather right here was done and since
walking further quick it works to a song
pretty sure everyone thought with access
also very tattooed and it's by Justice
sort of changed do they were DG and I
fell of them and I love that song the
star of my sleeve was my little gypsy
right here I actually worked with a girl
who got a gypsy Runner and the same
places he and she got them before me and
I saw it and I was like man that is
gorgeous
I absolutely love it and I've got the
kind of wreaths around it's the rose my
tattoo artist even again he drew this up
for me and did it for me so it's not the
same as that girls by any means at all
but she does inspire me to get its this
gypsy lady the next category's this one
right here it is a hand mirror with a
skull reflection and the I had I got the
two roses done at the same
around the murder I actually love this
tattoo it's one of my favorites for sure
I just think it's absolutely beautiful
and it was a little bit inspired by the
fact that the makeup I had a Hummer door
it's a nice similar to this
then I bought my candelabra which is
just here and it was pretty cool because
the actual candles it was right next to
the further which is smokin further so
we did a little bit kind of wisps of
smoke the candelabra goes into three
different sections and then there's
three different candles and then on the
back I have my RAM skull which is
actually my favorite her through that
I've got and I never had flop and see it
because it's on my back on the back of
my arm and it has a cool little gym here
which I really love this after that I
got my crystal ball with the hand
holding it she's got a little kind of
ruffle sleeve kind of Gordon stuck in
with a kind of gypsy theme almost and
then rain that we've just got this kind
of stuff as a fellow and this is just
her it's thick it's like a sleek power
coming from the crystal ball and that it
was just the kind of make it can fill my
whole arm almost him taken out finish
off my sleeve I am fully aware that I
have the spigot messing section up here
but I must see that was the shortest bit
Fiat packed food mo I remember plane he
was finishing off up here I was like
he's stop you need to stop right now
because this is agony it was it was
unbelievable it was so sore but I go
through it and after I could have
finished off my sleeve I always wanted
my hands tattooed always always even
before I got any done when I was younger
I used to always kind of want something
on my hands it was just something that I
thought so beautiful and really cool so
I finally got my B so this is my little
B he is beautiful he doesn't have a name
I've struggled to cover my name but he's
got Ruby and cross it in his back which
I actually thought was super sweet
because when my best friend's cat I had
a baby and her name is Ruby so I love it
and then I've got that little flourish
right around it which I love be good
dropper dropper come on
come here I really want a drop tattoo I
really want to drop my tattoo I want
your back face your beautiful boobs
mm-hmm
then I got my design unit here which is
kind of heavily inspired by Mindy I'm a
little called Hannah I think it's sort
thing I used to make up on a lot of and
women who had had a gun for away things
and things like that and I always just
thought it was so gorgeous so it's
almost like a lot of inspired by
Scottish as well because there's paisley
pattern in there it's just like a little
custom design on my mitt and then the
latest addition to my body is my finger
tattoos so I got my fingers tattooed
about two weeks ago
they are already pretty faded but that's
because I maybe picked them just a
little bit and really Saudis even if
you're listening to this but I am I
absolutely love the Jeff's pie I don't
know they're just try in it's like a
little design egg it's just like a
little design and I just really really
like the idea of having them over my
fingers I'm although people just get a
knuckles done in his words but honestly
I didn't want to get words because I
knew that I made a circle of thumb I
didn't know what a or four to four layer
words I wanted so I just got the designs
in just a little bar on the fingers you
know my fingers do create art after all
oh and if remote one on my little hat oh
go ahead cut up tools I have a little
min I have a little man in the moon I
don't know why I got that I was 17
that's not a kind of tattoo whatsoever I
was 17 and I got my little Bella woman
man I just I just thought it was really
cute and I liked the whole man in the
moon in that story now I showed you all
my kind of semi appropriate tattoos I'm
going to show you some ones I did agree
but you're a mistake that's right here
is a Broken Arrow you'll see that the
arrow has no head and I got this on an
eyepiece and when I went with my friends
and I was 18 and it
pointing finger so when a doll to point
at drinks yeah that was bad I also wore
the same trick the same trip to the
tattoo studio I thought a diamonds by my
ear which I think about many people cars
and I think it was quite heavily
influenced by shame bright like a
diamond in the wonderful Rihanna's Linux
yeah so that's part of my body
last but not least and I don't know if
all my family knows that I've got that
my mum dad definitely dude hey have you
heard guys I've ever seen Jack my
boyfriend he is very homely tattooed
himself and at one point he had a tattoo
kept so he could practice we had like
the skins and stuff like that so you can
practice tattooing and when they got the
tattoo gun out and we thought this is a
really good idea we thought it was going
to be really fab and I actually have a
patent on a Nintendo my work and it says
swag well used to see swag I don't know
what it says no I think at one point it
did see slag as 4-pin I personally I
think I've got a high tolerance high
pain tolerance that and I can kill you
if we always cannot okay and rear agony
so up here on my arm was totally fine
but I was there for a long time to get
her finished so that was kind of sucky
honestly the all of my whole arm was
fine apart from my n side of my arm here
and my elbow Israel I've got them both
covered elbow was not as far as you
think but when I went in to see Stephen
and we were talking about it I was like
I do not want that inside of my arm
joint or my elbow let's just missiles
out I'm not trying to be a tough person
I just don't want that to happen and yet
here I am he just decided that I was a
liar obviously the most painful was my
fingers that was the worst I've ever
been through my entire life I don't have
any on my board a on my stomach I keep
on sayin that and I point up or lose it
that away or I'm happy football day then
I will get it tattooed but that keeps on
not happening either I love food I love
cheese and I love daily and I love stuff
I love eating everything this is me this
is me and when and I am super super
happy with all my tattoos most of them
apart from a couple
goodness betters on the inside of my
life no one would ever know unless I
said it and I've said it to the entire
internet which is really clever for
aftercare
I like to if it's possible my fingers I
can do this way I choose the panthan or
my tattoos this is nappy rash cream bee
bee bop cream and it just heals them
really well what I like to do it as well
as I like to keep some rats so what I
would do is I would go home from getting
a tattoo done leave it for a couple of
hours and then take the cling film off
they always clean up cling film tattoos
unless it's your fingers rubber take
that off rinse it with warm water and a
mild soap then put the panting on it not
a set clear at all just enough to cover
the entire tattoo and then wrap it and
what I would do is I would maybe change
my wraps twice a day before it was
asleep when I wake up and that just
means that it's these super goopy and it
doesn't really scab and then after about
three or four days than that I'll let
you get to it and then it heals soil so
all my patters are colorful and and
honestly all healed agree I always say
wear fake tan and or I get a plan as
well like I'm his son and stuff if it if
it appears here but when I want holiday
I do time I like to say on the sign so
my tattoos are faded into my skin a lot
but I like that again it's personal play
friends and I think that where the
colors are all can adult down with a tan
aim it's my favorite thing I do not
recommend it in tattooed if you're on
your period the pain is a lot worse
every time I go for a tattoo I have a
bottle of orange lucozade to stay
hydrated and then the sugar stops me
from ever feeling sick from there for a
long time especially I'll just kind of
swag my lucozade and that keeps me going
always it before you get a tattoo and
don't get them done if you're under 18
por que eles luck I hope you guys like
this video of a definite idol do let me
know if you would like to see more
videos like this if you like me to take
you with me the next time I get a tattoo
done I can vlog it and I will see you in
my nature
