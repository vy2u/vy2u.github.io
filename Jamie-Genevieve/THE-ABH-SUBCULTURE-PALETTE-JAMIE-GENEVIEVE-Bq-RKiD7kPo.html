is what I look like say I'm gonna shut
this door hi guys welcome back to my
Channel today I'm going to show you how
I did this look basically I had this
palette in my basket and I was so close
to buying it and then I was like nah I'm
not gonna bother
I've seen enough videos and all that
people are struggling with it there's an
office videos out there for you guys to
see to get whatever information you get
from them like it was tended tutorials
on it and then I got home from away than
yesterday it's our package not to - idea
I may add it was from cult beauty
because they just got the palette and
they're at website and I asked guys on
snapchat if you wanted a tutorial and
you do and you did and I was actually
really excited because I had been in
Teja and I was in sit down in Crete I
really gorgeous eye makeup for everyone
that's bought it so far show you guys
how you can get and they say make up out
of it and also I was pretty sure in my
head I was going to be fine with the
palette I've seen people struggle and I
really should not I shouldn't have been
so stupid because the people that I was
in struggle are really talented makeup
artists really talented but for some
reason I was like I'll come sure I'll be
fine
it was the most restraint and I am a
self I've ever done in my entire life I
have stopped halfway through and try it
again
I've never had to do that at my tire
life and yeah I didn't even know if I
wanted to put as a job the day I thought
why not because everyone else consider
doing it yet just know that this is not
coming from a bad place
I love on a side this product so much
this palette all I just kind of get on
board with I yeah you'll see exactly
what happened you'll see what happens in
this tutorial and he would like to see
how I created this look
Penn Station so I'm going first prepare
my lid with Liam all pimple everyone
knows are used all the time so there
should not be any different from with
Pilate with my Beauty Blender
over I have done no other makeup I'm
going to finish finish my face afters on
my eyes because from what I've seen
there's quite a lot of fallout so it's
going to be much easier for me to clean
up I do not do my foundation for us
today
another my bros i those because i don't
know what's going to happen so I've done
an eighth layer of that not too sick
Justin and I'm going to hide out
underneath my as well
I'm usual I'm going to apply my powder
the charlotte tilbury airbrush flawless
finish podo and issue 2 and it's going
to mattify my legs quite a law I'm just
packing out on a rare day I'll have to
nurse here is the subculture palette and
I am a huge fan of modern medicines
palette I think it's gorgeous
obviously there's so much drama
organized on pilot those people dying
and everyone's losing their shit a bit
an eyeshadow palette so here is the
copilot oh shit here going to look like
I have literally not touched it apart
from the sheen to fight which i swatched
and look pregnant head ill insane and
we're just going to use that it comes in
a little brush I never really used the
brushes that come with eyeshadow
palettes I may use the stayed at the bed
dance
I could use that from outer corners
there's Tara row is like saying yeah
saying okay I just did
I'm going to take a little color off the
memory so nice manner it's one of the
more expensive Meadows I don't really
know what this I'm going to do it I was
not really to say that we avoid this
issue Drock so first here nice it's like
a peachy transition Ishii yeah and then
color and wear it to the scene I'm just
using a semester see to brush and I'm
just using my usual window wiper
movements and then bringing it up
whistle blows that's nice I say that is
a nice color in a blended feign
make everybody go Street and with fudge
I'm really such nice because I know that
there was some in
some swatches it showed that the front
is different unless pilot and then a
mortar and so on so I'm gonna use the
same brush and when I just tap fudge so
fall out why this one looks it's just
literally soft to my brushes can I made
little indentations in it and this brush
I use it for every stone
I use these brushes all the time so I'm
not I'm not like overly shocked by
that's gonna I've got a lot of that
fudge building that I'm literally just
touching it and in applying and being
pretty careful it definitely looks more
killer towards another fudge next
seventeen brush I use the Philip
integral this is a clean one and I'm
going to go in with the shades Roxy
again and we try and blend that a little
bit I'm not sure I'm not sure but I'm
going to try about another side and
let's just pick up the tiniest amount of
Pegman before blend in a I'm just doing
it kind of bit by bear okay I'm going to
try and blend that out again this is
quite powdery
this is so weird
it's oh it's okay my bad but it's not
easy like it's so strange because I know
that fudge fudge you see my favorite
color and I hide it as a single and I
was used at all the time and this is not
what face looks like this looks dark and
almost greedy and it is not going to
anything I thought that I would I would
be kind of fain to be honest doing that
but it's not easy I'm just going to go
over it again with that Roxie shade just
to try and make it look smooth like I
feel like I almost wanted each end from
like cocoa beer from makeup geek so I
know that that just goes all and like
easy peasy but I'm struggling to build
their self and for it to loosening I
feel like nervous definitely I'm like to
touch her a little bit right that looks
okay I feel like we're playing dead the
legs is already the letter smart kind of
going to funny I've just been going back
and forth back and forth and then
placing someone and landed I I think I'm
going to work mr. shade old star no I
would've worn with the 17 brush that was
not as totally Valentin's who plays
differently and and I'm just going to
apply that over top to see you have out
there I feel like that clothes kind of
saved a little bit and bringing a great
amount of coroner just so contain me to
look as smooth as possible that color it
seems to have helped me blend the fudge
shade into the warm shade by then it
shouldn't be that difficult
it shouldn't be that hard to blend a
warm brown color and we spoon in with
that Roxy shit again I don't think that
said about the way I die I need to go in
with fudge again to it small even okay
okay okay I don't really know what's
done to me why I might use the blue like
I just been holding the palette
one on my hand okay let's use them
place your gun came first again that was
not opposed to me and I use either the
I'll Pat and tie shadows before I use
them I'm going to use this under my eye
and then I'm going to use access all
that great that one's not go today at
all streams and I just put that right
over corner oak nice okay that's looking
all day actually it's not looking bad
and I'm going to use my seventeen grudge
so they're going to use one of these
colors and we're trying new ways I'm
going to tie up a new weave on my legs
to see that helps blend out I don't
really know what to do from here it
looks a little bit disjointed
I've already done a dark wood late last
week and there's water touring oh that's
it looks quickly maybe I'll try that
nothing's happening I'm gonna try it
adorned which is the Goldy shades with
their brush that they gave you in pilot
not bad yep I got
I'm really not sure but I think as my
Falls I thought really like what
itemized it looks really wishy-washy it
looks a bit like a man to the wanted
retail access and my crease yeah I'm
going to try and turn it into better
little blue look so I'm just using my
smooth brush oh here I'm just going to
keep going no this is actually the first
time I've ever done my entire life I
feel really right I don't think it's a
pallet full I think as we took our joint
effort I don't think that an easy to
create a look from there like see go
into it and not really know what I was
going to do I may start because I don't
like what I've done at all I try to use
too many of the colors but at the same
time I do want to be able to use more
than a couple of colors for the look to
look nice I'm going to take it off and
we're trying again
yeah we're t-tom try again hello but try
this again I'm going to just do a makeup
look that I'm going to definitely like
I'm not gonna use all the colors
I'm know already that I'm going to use
new leaves and my crease blend Roxy and
then fudge all over my lids and that's
it I will use those three countries done
first all over new leaves Roxy fudge all
over and that is that because as soon as
I reached a little blue it's when things
started to context up so we use Dawn all
over new ways and make sure you sort of
just using the same motion and I'm using
my Mac two to four brush but all I do
when I'm applying eyeshadow is a
literally tap it twice and apply and I
do that all the time I never throw my
brush I never go into it to here behind
it website no way we're all said we're
going to crease
there's actually no point we're doing
that because roxy is comment later on
the list and that yellow shoes so I'm
not sure use it in result I know I'm
going to swap and we use a dance broke
I'm going to use my semester for seven
brush and she's budget I'm going to use
it all over my life and I'm going to
plug it up just as soon as I usually do
with my dark smokes we bring up at all
very much please
alright where's the initially what's
happening this is what's going on right
now
he was put more mortal in the clothes it
seems to skip a little bit on my leg
can you see that I'm going to swap back
to my two to four brush from Mac there's
a good time blend that up look I'm going
to try using the new weave color to
blend
Jesus Christ right I was going to try
and finish this off and I'm really
excited with a smaller brush and I was
going to smoke it out I'm actually
touching it once before anyone says I'm
putting too much product on I'm touching
it one like that saying that my oh my
god alright I'm going to me back out
just try and fix oh I should do it he
even I do not feel very wish right now
this is really fresh tree and look I
can't do this
I didn't I can't do though okay okay and
then I'm done I really wanted to like
this palette and I really wants to do a
look that was like really nice because I
know a lot of people bought this palette
I tried my hardest I did the first look
it was looking okay and and then I
suppose I tried to add on to many of the
colors and it ended up just looking
really really Maisie tried it again I do
this like all the pain using pretty much
any other brand of a shower door I use
notes I use more fear even I use oils
when Thomas first makeup geek loads of
different brands
I do this all time warm transition shade
brain all over lashes it's classic it
looks nice it's like the easiest thing
ever so you don't come and look at those
have you ever seen my tiny couple of
those
okay this was wrong with very action
yeah yeah I'm trying it's late I have to
yeah basically I really wanted to look
then
I think Einstein is product for
brilliance I really like the modernist
palette I really like the single
eyeshadows I really like to play
products I love the road jail I use it
all the time and to be honest with you
guys getting really really
even though I have had absolutely zero
support from that band and I still
continue to buy those stuff and so
continue to use it because it's good so
you know that that it's like a
legitimate feeling and I do not know to
made those never ever in my life and I
had to stop doing what I was doing and
take off and try again never and I've
not seen that and then I'm the best
makeup artist in the world old because
I'm not but I know how to put eyeshadow
on and honestly it's sort of straight
and when you just can't so that's it I
hope you like it I mean yes wait the
internet I love you back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
