we are going to be using and reviewing
and first impression Aang the new bleach
london eye shadows so this title of the
video is obviously the price of these
eyeshadows which is three pounds but I
think is clearly obviously makeup geek
is really an expensive as well but these
are even more inexpensive so I thought
it would make for quite a cool video to
test these eyeshadows out see if the
quality is there or C's much as the
price if you like to know how I go on
and how I create this eye look then
please keep watching hello
so we're trying X my shadows I'm very
excited very excited haha so these are
the bleach London
Sango shadows and then I've got two
fancy little pressed glitters here so
what we're going to try these out
because they're only three quid each
well actually where's my phone I'm gonna
double-check your faces blur so I've got
PR books from bleach london very cool PR
box can i want to be a bleach london
girl the way that they all look and
there are magazines and stuff it looks
sick so we have glitterati
which are the two solid gutters are five
pounds each and then the eyeshadow
singles which are called louder powders
very kill again are only three pounds
each i needed to try these out these are
the cheapest single shadows that I have
come across the packaging and the Cana
brand branding is the coolest thing ever
they've done such a good job so I just
really wanted to create a makeup look
using these and the beliefs on the
palette this size this is the large one
is only ten pounds and is really cool
it's obviously magnetized and then it
says you can't see it because the
shadows but it says bleach london
underneath that I've already done my
base if you're wondering what it is is
the new who WT foundation I have done a
video for this already is up yet don't
know cousin feminine and the same day
like get champ so let's just get started
I'm really bloody say it so the look of
would actually I don't know
don't know obviously the colors that I'm
really interested in are these warm
tones but people get really annoyed at
me for using them too much so maybe I'll
do something a bit more colorful let's
just try I'm not planned out my look but
I'm just gonna try these shadows the
only thing that I would see is the color
cords are not the easiest that a little
bit weirder so I'm just gonna point to
the color and then what I'll do is hmm
this is hard because all the shadow
names are pretty strange it's like TD
for M a which means matte but maybe it's
just TD that I'm meant to look at but
then what if this one's called TT as
well vx not sure so I don't know how I'm
gonna do that but what I may do is I may
look through the ones I use and then let
them down at the end that's what I'll do
effort but lovely and that's why I'm
gonna do it so first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna build up my crease I am
gonna use a warm color just because
that's what I would usually do I don't
want to go into this palette and start
doing some crazy it's not gonna
work out because I'm trying out to your
technique yeah you wanna give it a fear
of your goal so maybe I'll start with
this orange here
not much kick up at all and I've already
picked and my eyeballs with my tart
shape tape I'm gonna mattifying my eye
make sure that there's no moisture on my
lid that's gonna mess up the shadows so
I'm just using my faint a parrot artist
max I'm eyelids I really hope these
eyeshadows amaze and because if they are
for a bargain seriously I have used this
one before just here I did a video with
Cody takes that's where these shadows
are sold I got a video done with Cole PA
and I use that eye shadow and I really
just like it I'm gonna use a fluffy
brush oh it's me you in everyday I'm
gonna use this orange color to start
building up my crease good so far
nice three pans bad I'm just using a lot
was a weaver 2 to 7 brush to get the
started and the reason I like using the
warm transition color it's just because
it blends really really easy or you guys
know I think what I might do is I might
actually do my usual warm crease but
I'll try it at blue glitter how does
that sound
that's freaky enough for you love okay
now
can't really go wrong there right let's
go in with a depreciate let's go in with
this color here this is like oh so this
one seems have a little bit more
kickback not bad saying doesn't bother
me too much it's not too much follow
it's not like fooling it pan or anything
we're gonna just build that up a bit and
we're going right in the crease I'm
gonna do my usual and I'm gonna bring
that right in inner corner that color is
really nice it reminds me of a color
that you'd find in a lame cream palette
when I guess look for your brush oh I
like this brush a lot actually this is
the morphe e27 brush I'm gonna go in
with a little bit more of that Orange
I'm just gonna use this to really bust
it this brush is really kind of big and
fluffy so it's good for exactly that
buff in it right
making sure it's super blended one thing
I would say is they're not crazy
pigmented upon like first application
but you can really build them up which
again so it's me just fan doesn't bother
me at all that's amazing I think one of
the reasons it was really excited about
this brand when they were launching
makeup is because Lou Teasdale who I
have had the pleasure of meeting here a
few times now she's so Glee she has had
a huge part to play and this brand and
this launch so I was really excited as
the coolest brand know very like part of
me is like oh man I wish I thought of
that because you'll see it when you look
at all the packaging and stuff it just
looks sick I'm just going in with a
little bit more of that ready color
inner corner oh my god these are so
great to close out of pixel far anyway
are brilliant don't know if the formula
changes at all between them so those two
colors are my pool job I would really
use a lot okay what's next after the
prettiest that blue got your shower go
to him you know maybe I'm just gonna go
under my I was
color again we're gonna start getting
that under dice smoke that you all here
for so I'm just going to go in with that
same ready color we're gonna go under
the eye yeah that's amazing
that color is so lovely three flip
components that he paints d-bags
simpliest juno was really nice about it
as well as obviously these are total
drugstore traces right but it doesn't
feel drugstore it doesn't like see the
packaging and stuff there's so so much
like attention they all come like
individually wrapped and there's really
cool little sleeve like it doesn't feel
drugstore it doesn't feel like the place
that is at all yeah because leave it
like that like that's two eyeshadows and
I applaud you love it you know I'm gonna
do and when you go in my inner corner a
little bit more of those red shades
we're getting like a almost soft spot
like I I think that the branded and
stuff like that
it suits our grungy look that's might
look really shows a but you guys
obviously that you want break I colors
so I'm gonna use this yellow it's really
calling to me so I'm gonna use a little
flat brush and I'm just gonna use this
on my inner corner and see here we go on
okay so that's nice but it's not as
great as I thought it would be I still
love little I think do you know what
would look good with this some see if
you were to do a cut crease and use a
white base that would make it so much
brighter I think that you can't see it
maybe I just cut my skin tone it's a
cool little touch I'm going to go in
with this gold that I've used before cuz
I know it's all lovely and really
pigmented and I'm gonna call just under
my tear duct it's just there I'm just
gonna bring that into the inner corner
of me bit I think I liked it better
before that's annoying I'm gonna do
school and smoke that out again with
that really color I love mm-hmm so
that's like a little touchy a love which
is quite nice
I think I'm just gonna leave it there I
don't wanna overwhelm us face with color
you know right I need to try one of
these quick
but only one I really want to try right
now is the blue I think I need to keep
in my crease up for that and then I you
wouldn't for me this is where I would
stop I really like this but I'm gonna
try it some of the other colors so I'm
gonna go in with US Navy here and I'm
gonna pack this on my lid as a base for
this blue cluster yeah it's pretty good
and I'm just using a really flat brush
from Diego della Palma and then I'm
gonna go in that warm me braid and I'm
just gonna blend that in a little bit I
think the same thing for the darker
shades not crazy pigmented on first
application but you can really build up
and I'm getting no fallout which is a
really good packing it all and then
again I'm just gonna blend that using
that warm a red color do not I'm going
to do it and when you're going with my
smooth to say a brush and a bit of the
blue and I'm gonna try and blend past my
beret past my braids past the crease and
to the red that's Michael really badly
because it's a cool color mixing with a
warm color but maybe no maybe not for
Jamie and then we'll go back in with the
warm color yeah that's actually fine
that's not bad
they'll not really getting any folio
which is really good okay
when you're going with that orange and
the warm color that I like and just use
them to really boss this sheep oh oh my
god that's is it sweet for you and I'm
gonna go in with this amazing blue glass
her and I really know how to approach
this I don't know how to put it on my
face so I'm gonna do what I would
usually do get something better on my
little flat brush I was using for the
blue and I'm just gonna Pat that on
put to end the shadow wow that's
unbelievable
do you know what it's nice it's not just
one color of glitter it's got purple and
blue
I got a we better follow it with that
but that's fame because I've powdered my
undereyes big dream so I like that so
I'm gonna spray my brush go into the
glitter
I think that's lace folly than over to
go with a loose glitter so there's that
I think because the Blues mixing with
the Reds tones it's going a little bit
muddy color wise but it's so blended so
I don't really mind it's still giving me
there
I've got glitter all over my face now
but cause my foundations all finished in
a Walmart you just brush it off a lesson
I've learned as maybe don't apply
declutter until you're sure that you're
finished with your shadow or maybe use a
definite glare of famer maybe that was
my mistake
thank goodness that's foundation is
matte honestly otherwise that's got a
ruby and mouthface fault Allah I'm gonna
show it off and do some mascara and
lashes it'll be right back tell you my
thoughts so you guys guys the finished
look all I did was added mascara and I
had a little bit of watch trouble ended
up using the meekness lashes by Lily
lashes that's what I've got one right
now I'm gonna show you a close-up of the
eyes never good all finished sorted out
I been in place I can't believe how
inexpensive these shadows are and like I
said earlier what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna take this one this one this one
this one this one and this one that is
all the colors that I used and I'm gonna
list them all down below if you guys are
interested but I know that these are
also them coat okay so I'll link that
down below as well as all the other
bleach london stuff which i'm yet to try
he's got a whole new bunch you can hair
care and stuff like that they've also
called canna contour powders and things
but i will need to get my hands on them
by the way the lipstick and look
using as Yosh by Mac with the Tartus
