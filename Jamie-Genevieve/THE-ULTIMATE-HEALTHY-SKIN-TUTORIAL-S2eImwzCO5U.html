I'm going to show you how to do this
entire list is just the most gluey
perfect
I can't do perfect cuz Murphy's it's my
Steven Salem makeup free though it's
just super dewy and glossy and expensive
skin and it's just like lace it's
perfect for summer it does last a long
time on the skin but it was really
beautifully it gets more doing and I
just absolutely love it
I wish needed this look on Instagram and
you guys all wanted to see it so here it
is and I actually just will have two
beer in the same top as washed I promise
so yeah I'll give you a little coarser
and it's just the most do skin super
fresh it's easy than anything as well
because there's actually no eye makeup
at all just mascara and lashes there's
no actual eyeshadow or anything like
that the browser done super easily super
quickly and obviously the lip is
literally just a gloss is nothing too
serious
I hope you like it actually going to
like to see how I create this lip into
picture let's do this I'm sorry just
like put in the little top part of my
hero so it doesn't get in the way of my
creation okay first things first we need
to pray for our skin skin here as it's
super important in this makeup tutorial
because it's all about skin I want my
skin to look expensive and fabulous
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take my chi chest antioxidant do it
this is fast becoming one of my favorite
things ever it's spoken about in the
beauty community right now it's like the
new thing that everyone is safe West I
like pop out on my skin it's called
fringe and ghoul as I'm not exactly like
what you want to happen it all times
with your skin so what popped out on
never monster eyes oh I am going to use
my Kiehl's super multi collective creams
which I like a lot is definitely a sort
of between this and the skin code cream
but I think this probably targets more
concerns I think the skin coach James is
really lovely in the late and I think
that's actually one of the reasons that
I like it so much because I don't like
anything to clog you and my skin do
but this is super late as well field
it'll be but more residue back so domain
that and as always were patent our
products and I have noticed a huge stuff
into mask incentive started passing
rather than robbing every sentence so
they were fresh with see them with
moisturised remember Street and with
their foundation I'm going to use
deterrent stick foundation and the shade
pants and and I like to just do my lane
just like so obviously this is a little
bit dark for me at the moment
so I'm going to mix it with my makeup
forever stick foundation and white c
satisfies both of these foundations are
trade different I would see the Tarte
ones more matte this one's got more of a
doing this to it but mixed together at
they're both gorgeous and they do last a
really long time so I like mixing my
foundations I would say if you've got
more oily skin try the tar condition and
if you've got more dry skin try to make
up forever I'm just using that can up in
between the lines are already there so
it becomes more my skin tone and then
those we're going to take her kills oil
just daily reviving concentrate and
we're going to drop it on a face so four
drops to the cheeks we're on the
forehead one on the chin I don't know if
this makes a huge difference I feel like
it does so emerge completely in all the
said
and that as we have been do much indeed
shed pretty much every day for the last
little whale I really love it I think it
looks a lot more natural it's got that
beautiful genus to it it's more sheer
for me it's not actual coverage is more
natural it's just really healthy weekend
I love it and also the end of the day
when I take my makeup off I feel like
I've had like a face mask on or
something because I've got all these
beautiful layers of skincare just the
best thing ever okay I'm going very much
or am i brave I'm not going too much
onto my legs because this is another
makeup look here I don't even touch my
eyelids I will actually just put mascara
on lashes off and it's like this you've
got it pretty careful when you're
blending this and because we applied our
foundation in lanes you don't want any
of those things to still be there you
know so if you look what do you think
supertuesday once so now I'm going to
grab my Tarte concealer this edge shape
tape and the sheet and size that matches
my foundation and I'm just going to put
a little drop of this under my so just
like that I like to use a little bit in
between my bridges because I do like to
have a little bit more coverage just
right in the same time well about my
chin little bit Roma nose and then spot
conceal if you need to and obviously
that's why you want to use something
that matches your skin to another than
at the end too late
I've been trying to take care of my skin
a lot recently on my sports are slowly
but surely oh I was going to be playing
that entered using the same Beauty
Blender just like that but of the people
after that kind of defies just thinking
that concealer right up underneath the
lash line and that's why I like to call
fish skin so I'm not going to touch
underneath my eyes right my raposo I'm
actually going to go straight and on top
with some creamed corn
today I'm going to go end up with my
chronic one zone at Pegman step in 3.22
this is a cream corn syrup
and I'm going to sketch out I don't want
this to be too heavy but I'm just going
to because we're always going to blend
most of us just right into the skin but
this color is really good for contouring
because it is ashy oh no and I'm not
going to contour my dolls I'm going to
start blending this in I see that good
and then I'm bringing that down my neck
a little back so don't work any lanes oh
and the key to this part is just make
sure that you're blamed and everything
pretty much a weird you just need to
know laying right over the one in just
nine more messiness
not devoid of American words we bring my
bronzer down and I like to spend some of
that color onto my ears now I'm going to
pair down Mahfouz I'm going to use my
Charlotte Tilbury
ear brush a flawless finish make sure
your skin perfecting micro powder
initiator which is medium and this
stuff's are really finely meld it's
really gorgeous I'm just going to put
this on and I'm winning is part and
motions and we're just going to hit the
center of the feeds
I like setting that and between the brow
and I'm just going to both enough brush
all from a forehead and then once the
powder has kind of settled a little bit
you can use sweeps and motions just to
make sure it's mostly into the skin so
now we're going to perfectly matte and
the same give it the favor of face
they'll have that dead do now I'm going
to bronze up using my give me some
bronzer by Mac and my tryouts will be
butter brush and I'm just going to warm
up the cheeks and then bring it down my
neck as well and we're just going over
where we use the creamed corn sir
and there's canna produce and confit
obviously we use creams is just going to
make it a little bit more long-lasting
and I think I love that because there's
no harsh edges there's no creams a
contour which I do love and I do do on
the daily but not be super fish can I
discover you know we're going to when
and this is like an old favorite of mine
by just not use in ages and when you use
the Marc Jacobs the glow stick and the
shade spotlight I found this when I was
rummaging through makeup and I'll switch
fake ads and I think we'll try our
fingers first you see that it just looks
like health and I like to use it a
little touch of our fingers just above
my brow bone terminal just all the usual
spots and then I like to get my damn
Beauty Blender and I'll actually just
swipe it with this and that didn't go
the most seamless application
hahaha look so he'll see what you can do
is well it can get a lot about peridot
and just powder underneath the columns
here and that just stops any clearly
showing the movie so what that means
cool in your jaw but nothing nothing
keeping us you know so those are super
easy with this look as a me in a little
bit so Gregg a really really easy way
look I just absolutely looked in a
sneaker back and wear that every single
day of my life so I sees both all you
need is a brow gel and a rope and cells
the first thing we're going to use is
the breaker safe or I cannot say that
word very precise fiber fellow from
nibbling brush through your eyebrows
with this it's the one with the weird
brush it's on its side he's brushed
through your clothes take your time
because you don't want any of these
little fibers going on your foundation
just finish that and it's perfect right
to the front making sure those hairs are
nice and rushed up so can you see the
difference it's just a little bit darker
a little more groomed and once you do
that you can get a much better idea of
where you need to fill your browser
orbit the should be
is the match bushybrows once you go home
course grab your gray pencil this can be
anything I'm gonna use the Urban Decay
bro beater other ones I really like are
the micro brow pencil from neck and the
Anastasio afterwards they all do the
exact same thing I believe my baby toe
and B shade dark and I'm just going to
fill in the areas that need a little bit
more help and maybe need a little bit
more structure so I'm just going to kind
of darken up the tail ever so slightly I
like to bring the end up just a little
bit higher and then I like to darken
just the front and bring it down a
little bit and I'm beaming really really
like I handed with it because it is
quite dark and then you can always use
your little spilly just to push through
keep your deference and I let's take a
hard look at anything for that boy
and then the thing that can i tape it
all together is just going to do your
face once more with the very gel it just
kind of blends the pencil in a little
bit more it starts from looking still
kind of separately and just cool through
again and also make sure actual grows
thicker because there's little fibers in
there and when you layer a couple of
quarts on it just makes you look super
sick and healthy either she's in a
little bit underneath but what we do is
we just a little extra powder that's
that just a little tiny bit of bronzer a
menorahs just a tiny little bit just as
my gummy son from Mac just to make sure
middle is doesn't get water in my face
and I know it shows mascara and lashes
my favorite lashes for this look are the
lovely lashes and the fatal can this is
in here they are super fluffy the five
I've already wore these twice and I
actually lakes on better whenever were
them a couple times I respect that
they're much more easy to work for us
and yeah they just really stuck on as
well because there's kinda proof that
was kind of like glue left over we're
just going to glue these up with our duo
glue the brush on latex free blue with
the green retain my favorite blue of all
time
set them down to dry and then we'll walk
Christmas Carol on okay you know me guys
we've got a new favorite mascara every
single video ray know it as the pure
silicon mascara and black and we're just
going to put this on our lashes
I've got no claim revive but why shadow
on my eyes I'm basically using the
natural tones and the lead Fredette
I don't really want anything on my also
even for longevity because there's
nothing there to crease this is a super
dewy makeup so if any of those oils got
on the legs your makeup would just get
creased unless you had a lot of ice
either one to mattify it down so I've
been trying to say and it works really
well and also got a little bit of a
cream highlight on my brow bone so
everything just looks super natural
those consider this girl
and even if you were in a huge last
waiter you could just leave it like this
s kya is super pretty it obviously it
does look we're not show but I wear the
last I signed it the key to vessel it
and making sure it looks seamless as a
large applicator like this you guys know
I love this one message from Tarte I
think it's called a little lash helper
something but basically you can just
squeeze the lashes right down and it
looks seamless which is important
because you don't have any eyeshadow on
do have any later on you don't really
have anything to stick the lashes on to
so your is important to make sure that
you get them nice and close to the lash
line I think these lashes are long and
fluffy enough about being too thick so
once they're stuck on I just have a
little clear day and make sure that
they're doing what I want them to do and
not dry it so I can still move them
around a little bit and then we just
leave them to kind of dry before we
squeeze it down okay I'm gonna do it and
then I think one of my favorite parts
with this look is the left so this is
the partyís let's paint and the shades
hailer like hella nude we're just gonna
shove on and I use it one all that later
or anything I just put it on and it has
a beautiful pigmented gloss
I would need to squeeze the glasses on
and and add more bottom mascara and
asking a little freer cold and then
lastly s winces left a little three of
only history from Urban Decay even our
skin is super Dewey I still want to say
everything and make sure it's going to
laugh so really does my C's in that and
then I get my Beauty Blender and just
push that into the skin and that you
guys are deep finished look I hope you
really like here is definitely my
favorite stay love makeups - right now
it's just super healthy expensive gluey
