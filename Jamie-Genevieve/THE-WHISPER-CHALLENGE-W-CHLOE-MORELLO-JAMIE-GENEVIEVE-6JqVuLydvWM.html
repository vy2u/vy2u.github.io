the West for challenge is one of us is
going to put these headphones on they
are sewn cancelling we're going to turn
the music up fill blacks and then the
other is going to see equipped to air
face and then we have to guess what the
chords do not mean reading lips yeah
which is why it's gonna be funny because
she's Scottish yeah not Molly
