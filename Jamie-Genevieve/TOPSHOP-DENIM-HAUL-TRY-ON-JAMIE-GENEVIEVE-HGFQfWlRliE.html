we are fashion if he f CH you in fashion
I am very excited because I have teamed
up with Topshop you might have seen on
my Instagram a lot while ago I did a
post for them well this is the Fedora
and I will be showing you some of my
favorite denim styles so talks up for me
I remember waiting JV jeans I don't know
if you guys know what Jamie jeans are
but they are my favorite jeans and they
share the same name is me which I felt
the states have arranged a meeting since
I was about 17 years old and tough
enough them I went and ups are a
personal shopping experience these are
completely free you just go in and you
fellow a kind of form before you go let
the sailors know your favorite colors
your favorite styles if you're girly if
you're know fashion inspirations and
stuff as well and then when you get
there there's got this chic little room
turn out for you you go in they've got
respect though all these shoes were
already picked out for me and my size
you kept your size before you Gwen oh my
god it made it so much easier and I have
some jeans here that I would never
affect for myself by actually really
love them so six pairs of jeans you
might be an adventure that I'm wearing a
couple of different t-shirts as well
this is one of them and then I've got
this cute little white tee that says no
time for romance I have something for
romance or not know why and then at my
favorite favorite one is a yellow
t-shirt that says no hard feelings and
fried on it everything will be like
going below including these t-shirts and
this hat and these hoops I love it I get
all my called hips and walk short by the
way and silver just so you know so let's
get started the first sale of
Genographic they wear the crop and just
to let you know my side I'm usually I
think I'm pretty much a size 12
UK like across the board sometimes with
my big boobs every burger and then
means some trails just wanted to set
past my ass so these are the size twelve
these are waste they're eight lengths 32
I think all merchants are that they can
I reference and then my height I am
faceted so I'm a tall lady
the first energy there was a crop these
are a really gorgeous blue denim so they
like this they've got proper din and by
the way this is an appropriate day I
know you'll need to like wear them to
stretch the baby I have some snidely
little snapshots of me weeding the
settings as well this is a trial on hole
never coming before these jeans I
actually let them both see when I first
saw them I was pickle I think they're
gonna make me look quick back I think
they're gonna make me look quite like
white but they are actually really
really slacks I think if you think about
it it's kind of like the Jean version of
a co-op the straight leg the whole way
down and it just connects tease me some
ways it's cropped this set a couple
inches above my ankle and I absolutely
love them see these with just like a
white t-shirt and some trainers they're
really really casual but it's not like
you're winning in the leggings or
talkies it's like a little bit more
dressed up than that and I actually like
them so much that I got them in black as
well so I've got a little if I do of me
rhythm in black too they've got a nice
wide leg the whole width I'm as you can
see they're just the same the whole way
down and these set really nice and loose
they're nice and tight right in the back
and waist and my bum and then they just
gonna continue over but this gives me a
bum if you know I mean it's kind of like
a bum bum like a mom Jean but I really
really love them in again i'm a leggings
waiter a skinny jean waiter and that's
usually if I was really really excited
to put these jeans I think they look
crashing tell me the night sailor Jean
where these chic level fillings
straight jeans so these are straight up
and down again I thought they were gonna
make me like straight up and down and
really like no carbs or anything but
they actually really nicely again the
spectrum I'm really nicely
was my data at all but it's nice that
they weren't skinny the whole way down
and the ankle because it's not a really
really tight ankle I think that these
are the so nice it's like a stiletto and
again just like jeans in the maze top
you know just enough so typically I
would really is just like a killer
jumper I swear for cash and again
there's a really thick that data all the
Topshop jeans are prop right then and
those stretch out like a bit on wood and
you kind of get comfy over time as well
so these are another style black teen
kindly coral in my eyes the next I love
Gina is probably one of my favorite
styles from Topshop I have these and so
many colors these are the journey jeans
and they are super meth heads
skinny jeans much softer denim so
they've got a really nice stretch to
them and Junie jeans are really really
high waisted as well all the jeans that
I have here are high waves and none of
them below the belly button but these
are really respected become nice and
high they are really like succulent like
a few our leggings waiter like a sports
leggings waiter you will really like
these because they do just suck you and
you feel really really support it and
these ones had pill little reps at the
knees I am a huge fan of the ripped
jeans trend if another person tells me
we've got holes and routines I'm gonna
go crazy
I know that's next style I would never
pick for myself but when I tried them on
I thought I lived so Fame these are at
the GME jeans and the are Jamie Flair
it's the ones with the cool little
stripe phone so you've got a red and
white stripe that go down very
elongating I have pretty long legs as
that as these are a 30 32 I am usually
the consent before leg but they were
just off we were too long for me they
felt like a damage in really really
supportive be a bit sucker
the journey genes but they still really
succulent nice and high we've said the
last forever I've so-called peers from
when I was like 18 that I just can't get
rid of maybe I can knows I have sex new
pairs of jeans but these are just
gorgeous and then at the bottom they've
got a really cool little flare which I
again didn't think I was gonna like on
me but it made my legs look super long
and slim and because it's a jaime
jean-robert was still sculpted you know
I've got that help it's like two hands
to hold and then that brings us on to
the last pair of jeans for today and I
was super excited with these ones
because I never thought that I would be
able to wear them these are mom jeans
I absolutely slip in love them there are
probably like these are also a 30-30 too
but they set just above my uncle and
then I actually roll up the bottom just
a little bit more and they are very
tight around like my they're
high-waisted obviously but they're very
tight around my kind of like my bum and
my stomach and then the canal legs a
little bit looser but not that much but
the girl who held me and talk show up
said that these jeans really listen off
and the more you wear them they become
like your jeans drip mean like they just
fit like a glove
they gave you that moment bum as well
the crow of cheating that it doesn't
like flag in your body but it just makes
it look a super pair if you're super
curvy and you've got like a small waist
and a big bum or you just got like a big
bum and bedsides
then the Jamie jeans and the Johnny
jeans you will absolutely die for there
today I think that I am almost on the
verge of maybe not loving these as much
on me but I want to love them so much
that I'm just kind of wish going to I'm
gonna wear them in and see how they go
but I actually really love oh I'm a
knight they're great they're so nice
affected my waist really nicely and you
can always bail them a few one if your
waist smaller than the G nice you can
just build I mean really tighten
everything up and then again they've got
neat little reps on the podcast and
you've got a little rip on the pork it
at the back on the bum as well so you
guys that was my touch up whole I really
enjoy beach in this video is a little
bit different for me I just felt overly
know who I am this is how and you know I
don't know if I'm kill enough to fill
this look off I absolutely love it I
hope people some people really don't
like the Baker boy hat thing I think it
looks really really cool so this is me
trying to oh I don't know okay so you
