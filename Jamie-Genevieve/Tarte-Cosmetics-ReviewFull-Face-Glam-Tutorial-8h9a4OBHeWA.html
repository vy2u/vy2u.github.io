week I'm going to take you through a few
phases foil so we're going to do your
skin eyes and lips I am and I'm trying a
bunch of new product from Tarte yeah if
you want to see how I go from the serum
to hero and stitch it thank God
hey guys okay let's just and get right
get right into it first I'm gonna use is
the maracuja see right now so this is a
tart eye cream I'd seen quite a few of
my favorite youtubers and things using
this product so I'm just going to use
this underneath have already put it on
my upper eye I'm gonna pop that on
before the dry eyebrows and yeah avoid
it on my face and photos are used we're
honest as you know death row and I use
amazing concealer around them as well so
now I'm going to prime my face my face
is relatively clean it is clear I
promise I'm going to use the Bobbi Brown
feminine retched please base I am nearly
finished though it's a bit distressing
but it's my favorite thing in entire
world and if you haven't already noticed
I have no kneels on okay so I'm just
rubbing out all over my face and I'm
already can cleanse my skin this mornin
but I know quite a lot of like to use a
moisturizer underneath this I quite like
it just by itself there I want to kind
think I can explain to you guys how much
this has changed my life I feel like
just going to mail it so I guess oh
really times its Sheen to the skin and
what it will straighten into my
foundation now and I'm using the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
this is the strangest foundation of
every sentiment of my life
so for example I'm just getting it of
course I would say you need about that
much that's not enough actually I would
probably want more there so it's like a
liquid but it's not it's like benadryl
almost it's a bakery but I am this
colors a bit warmer than my skin because
obviously my skin is warmer than my face
right actually
my body so I'm just going to use my
Smith 1 1 5 brush we're going to put
that over and I like this completely
matches my face
so a lot of people have been asking me
for it compares to and I honestly can't
see it compares to anything I've ever
tried before let me just go in a bit
cool so you can actually see it it's
phenomenal and it lasts surprisingly
long on the skin and and also the
tribute gates like 650ml you get 50ml
trip as well so remember like
foundations usually come in to a little
packages so good value for money
and I would say the finish if you don't
powder is very jewy inflation which is
obviously my favorite thing in the world
and that's what I've been doing ever -
the last four days M
I just bought that and it's a little bit
lighter coverage then the March it comes
close obviously if you've seen the video
that I thought last time I went up at
mantle with a foundation and it was very
heavy coverage this as this isn't as
heavy at all you can kind of go in with
quite a lot product um oh I just love it
it's so - into anything I've ever used
before and I really like the way it
photographed I really like the way it
last through the day as well so I live
with us to work so I wore last hour I've
really busy Saturday in the salon and
and it was amazing and it was so good so
I'm leaving I underneath my eyes would
know in my jaw so this is actually this
is this color here was medium neutral
it's a wee bit light for me to snow for
showing my chest and it's a wee bit late
for me just now but obviously we do use
blondes over so it's fine
but as a really nice color are actually
because it's neutral okay underneath the
eyes I'm going to use the concealer so
this is the maracuja
a lot of I'm saying that right I'm
sorting from North Valley Kuja maracuja
creaseless concealer and when you use it
in medium neutral and again believe you
actually I have too much product in the
back from hand there's still some left
but I'm going to squeeze some of that
you need actually that
see here that's probably too much
breading is ice into my eyes so I'm just
going to use a gel fiber brushes as I
mean this isn't a branded brush and I'm
going to stipple that oil on Moss right
underneath that I am quite missing those
and I'm just going to kind of do the
highlight and points of my face I've
been trying all these products for four
days and this complaint that in with my
foundation brush and I am sore and
placed look her brightening that is a
hair then okay some digits in foundation
brush to blend that in to the foundation
this can see they're sick and you need a
hardly any of it again I've got like
loads left over in the back of my hand
which is sorta ring so fresh so right
would it when we fill up a lien law
people just with my fingers on the lid
just to cancel any dark tones and
prepare my eyeball for all the glow my
shadow I hope you guys realize I stopped
watching Vampire Diaries for you to do
this to record this video I'm gonna go
in with a little small brush from before
and just get right and close to my lash
line underneath Wow
super fresh super cool okay one wanted
to know I'm gonna set my under eyes
straight away I'm going to use Mac
accentuate so I'll use this before this
is our shaping photo so it's slightly
panky toned it slightly peachy
so it helps left any darkness under the
eyes and it's got a really slight
reflect so I left I totally left under
eyes which is still good so I'm just
going to pop that on underneath and
click a lot of it just to totally
mattify and when I did something on my
leg just to mattify sore it doesn't
crease and the brush I'm using for this
is just this mess one one two brush I
love these brushes so much but they
definitely need washed okay look at that
go
that's my under eyes all set fabuloso
and I'm gonna here
go ahead and just do my eyes now you saw
I've can I stopped arrived at I've got
my skin on the part I'm actually holding
it's what I'm going to use so this is
the toilet two part and as unbelievable
it's one of my favorite pilots of all
time such as a emblem is called and I'm
just going to start with my sugar pearl
tapered blending brush and I'm going to
use the color smarty pants which is this
transition shade here I'm just going to
use that in the crease I wonder how I
should do sighs I said maybe I should
zoom you in a little bit so I'm just
going to start with that shade and the
socket blender
Oh C Mon the other area obviously and
I'm just kind of working out for those
into the create with my brush kind of
elevated here so the kind of elevation
of the brush helps plane up towards the
brow so we get that nice smooth blend
and obviously we start with a transition
shade the Kois we want it to be easier
for braiding we go into the darker
shades pure okay then with one with a
slightly smaller brush this is the Smith
35 brush and I'm gonna go straight and
with the shade label which is this one
here it's like a nice warm plum and I'm
going to pop that increase as well these
eyeshadows are super super pigmented so
you just need a little bit and obviously
that's something like I've got two big
lines so I'm going to go straight in
with my sugarpill brush a little bit the
transition sheet as well I remember to
blend those a day
Hey
I'm just going on with more transition
shade if you're struggling to get there
just blend it just going with the
transition shade and kind of go over
their lane at the darker shade to me
King and use a little grounded movements
just to kinda help us out also remember
you've quite a few a new shoe brush I
like to just kind of go into the shadow
a tendency if you see that can I like
picks up any excess now I'm going to go
in with the darker shade and this brush
again and we've got under my eyes and
then I'm going to go back in with a
sugar pill brush and the transition
shade and just blend that over again so
just blending forever nice now what
we're going to do is we're going to go
in with the shade lido so I'm going to
start today kinda properly tool and
we're going with the shades here and I'm
going to use that to small coat
underneath and then I'm going to get a
small cocoa record on as well so using
the same brush as before and I'm going
to close my eye and just kind of go on
the top of the lash line here
Rocha kind of talk about how much I love
this palette anymore that I've um and
I'm going to try and flick away this
full and then what I think I'm going to
do ICS tank since I'm not sure yeah no I
am whatever that here is called
funny ghetto and it's just like a super
light shimmery gude champagne color I'm
gonna go on my lid nice I'm going to do
see in another side and another corner
as well now I think I'm going to smoke
my sight ever so slightly so I'm going
to go from the blower lash line and I'm
just gonna wing that I ever so slightly
it's like a super grungy but easy smoky
eye I love it so I'm going to went with
a little bit of the tarte precision one
we're laying out so it's just like a
really nice filter planar and I'm just
going to go in the inner corner just
cannot dark in the harsh lane
just rip I'm going to chose a weak one
within map bla black pencil I'm just
going to darken my whirling I don't
sound look really pretty but I'm doing
that and I'm also going to use a pencil
on the top lash line as well so I just
kind of loop down and drag the pen so
long that's something that takes me but
her breathing but it looks good
that's a weird thing in the world to
tell you I tell you okay I'm gonna go
ahead and stick some lashes on and then
I'm gonna be right back okay guys I just
stuck on a pair lashes I used Eldora m1
or C's so they're just quite flat today
the quite nice they're not too heavy now
I'm going to do is I'm going to warm up
my pasty little face and I'm going to
use the park and park Park Avenue
princess bronzer which is here I was
going to use that to warm up my entire
potato face so I just gotta go down my
jaw cheek I can't can I say me corn to
us boys with the bronzer and forehead as
well
and I would put a lot about the bronzer
either feeding my nose as well I'm going
to leave my skin like that usually I go
in with our darker corn co-product to
really chisel on my cheeks but I quite
like it like that today and almost
natural so I'm going to stick on a
little bit of their colorful highlighter
and just on the tops of my cheeks and
then I credit accord iron that good to
go the top of my lip and down the sides
of my head and then I'm going to change
the brush to a slightly smaller
eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to
get some product and then going the very
tip of my nose and then a little line
just above almost like an exclamation
mark now I'm going to go in with aa
blusher so my favorite blush art is
peaceful from tart and it's a really
nice break kind of quarterly color I
have never been one for million blushers
but I see the difference it makes and
skin it makes you just look thin thin to
life so I'm going to get a little bit on
my brush sale and just pop a little bit
above the contour and underneath the
highlight nice okay nice little lip
color and I'm going to have to go in
with my favorite one the like light
opening is is a key cool one and this is
504 precision and I'm just going to line
my lips first with this so I cannot
watch delivered or my lips quite a lot
so I'm going to start in the center and
get the natural lip line first
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to push out the top so I'm going
to kind of straighten it off a little
bit
so kind of overdrawn just the top here
but not the sides I'm going to push that
a little bit more okay I'm happy with
that
over drawing and then I'm going to work
with my favorite shader what pain so
these this formulas honestly and
cannibal it is like a really nice mix of
lipstick and liquid lipstick so it's not
the kind of like with upsets that you
put on and it's really really liquids
and then it dries completely it's not
like that at all it's Lakshmi and it
doesn't fully say it as well in the lips
it's almost like a kind of semi matte
but there's so much more comfortable so
much more comfortable and they wear
really nicely throughout the day don't
get that horrible laying I mean I'm just
going to shove this on
you
love that so i paris i just i gots the
most majestic color and the entire world
but you know that's just me finally
finished now it's up to you i'm going to
leave it there you can post it if you
like you can say if you like i
personally with this foundation it's
super long radiance will see this a
little bit my hands dry you'll see what
i try and move it it's super long wind
it's totally just the best it gives your
skin such an agent look without looking
too matte but it is quite a matte
foundation and the grand scheme of
things and but yeah I have just wanted
and 10% in love with tired and all the
products that they send me her as a new
brands to me it's not something that
