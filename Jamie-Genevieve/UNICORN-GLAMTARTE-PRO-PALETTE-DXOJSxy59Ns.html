I'm going to show you how to do this I
look it's something a little bit little
bit unicorn a little bit glittery a
little bit fab I'm going to be using the
new characters Pro palette my Tarte is
fast becoming one of my all-time
favorite eyeshadow palettes it is
beautiful it's so nice I hope you guys
like this look if you'd like to see how
I created it
keep watching let's do this
ah geez sorry but I guess it's product
I'm using as my tattoos Pro palette is
is really really really gorgeous I'm
really excited to show you guys and I'm
sure you've seen that loads of the guys
have been using this and their tutorials
and stuff so this is my little slant on
it
so the first thing I'm going to do is
pick my eye I've already got a little
bit of this lien law Paint Pot day and
favorite people talked about it and most
of my tutorials it's just super peachy
and it acts as a great base I use your
own most of my eye makeup once that's
gone
I'm going to go end it with the shade
balls just here which is a wee bit
darker than my usual transition shades
but it's lovely and I'm going to use
that all over the lid just to mattify as
always I'm just using my two-to-four
from Mac as always as well so just a
little bit of that color all over now
we're going to go in with the shades
Edison and whimsy which are obviously to
warm drone colors and pallet the Reeb it
warmer than brighter actually it's
almost kind of or burn but obviously I
gravitated towards those I love them
what can I say
so we did one with my 2 to 4 and a shade
innocent first and we're going to start
free and that beautiful crease so these
shadows are so buttery they're really
really pigmented just like all tarts
products it's a scene Amazonian clay
formula so if you've got the Tarte lip
palette or the tartlet 2 palette which I
also love you'll know already how great
these these shadows are I'm just going
to throw out there a few
our later skin-toned than me I would
maybe use one of the later shades for
the transition shade just because that
color is a wee bit dark you can see they
just blend themselves it's such an easy
job and you'll notice that on this side
I've kind of left the side a little bit
for your product so I'm going to the
same thing on this side I'm just going
to dust that way because I might forgot
that at that shape so right to create
that a shape I just keep my brush nice
and high now I'm going to women to shade
1z this beautiful color and I'm going to
start building that up in the crease as
well nobody went with my morphe M 507
brush and then we're going to go and
with the shade Wednesday again and I'm
just going to buff that underneath my
eye and then once I've started smoking
that underneath my eye using the side of
the brush to help blue blend I'm going
to slightly extend that over here and
then went back in with my Mac 2 to 4 and
then she's innocent which is the later
shoot we're just going to blend that out
a little bit as well I'm going to go
back home with my morphe brush I don't
want to go mad whimsy on top again the
darker transition and we're just going
to start defining our shapes so I'm
going to go over the crease and then I'm
going to start defining this kind of cut
crease I suppose I suppose it's quite
cut crease ooh there's a lot of softer
than a cut crease but do you know what
that means means it's easier I mean it's
going to be easier now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to start creating that a
little bit darker in here so I'm going
to go in with the to transition shades
and the Mac two to four brush and I'm
just going to start getting that a
little bit darker I have been eleven
smoking that in a coroner Lords lately
it's soon earth and who knows wondering
I give in to peer pressure and trim my
rose and I feel like Sam said I feel
like I've lost my strength from they
were doing it again and then I'm just
going to define that with my brush a
little bit now we start adding it the
pinky tone so I'm going to use this pink
here which is
called mod and then I'm going to go in
with a little bit of drama which is just
here and we're just going to make a lot
of a darker of those colors and just get
those Pink's to shine through so I'm
going to go in with my Mac two to four
brush first and I'm going to start using
that to help blend up here and then when
you go in with that color drama the
darker purple and I'm going to go
underneath my eye just a little bit
closer to the lash line this time and
then again kind of winging that a lot of
underneath and we were with this same
morphe brush I will use two brushes so
far and the shade drama and we're going
to just start to sketch on this crease
again
the nice thing about this look as you
can stop at any point feel free to stop
right here put some mascara and lashes
on if you want to keep old Matt and you
don't have to go fill unicorn reserves
but you probably should
okay I'm going to blend a little bit
more of these two panky colors just into
this crease one one more time I'm going
to leave that there just now I'm going
to go in with the shade classic just
here and I'm going to use my Smith to
five-city brush just like a nice little
flat brush and I'm gonna push that on
and I'm gonna use that shadow to help
define the lid you see that you see that
you see that okay now what I'm going to
do is obviously the palette has 16
matches and for dual chrome shades I
have used all 43 shades and different
lights they're beautiful
but we're going to use the shade Ghulam
just here with my with my little crap
finger and just going to push that onto
the lid for a little bit extra something
for we adds all the unicorn Ziggler I
just brought that up to be more of a
point like this side I feel like that
say maybe because Lord dude maybe my
face is lopsided
no what we're going to do is we're going
to add a little bit glitter my little
bit I mean hunters and I'm going to went
with the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter
and juncture I use this and my Halloween
tutorial I'm and I did the same kind of
thing I did a little glitter triangle
underneath my eye and it's my favorite
thing I wrote so we're going to do it
again but a little bit more detailed so
I'm just going to get the glut Eric
straight from the same straight from the
tube and I'm just going to start pinning
that on you have to go in a few times to
get it built up names back with straight
onto my legs just kind of move the
clutter around and try and make it look
and eyes evenly spread as possible and
I'm gonna just drag that up a little bit
here just the kind of same shape as the
lower LED that we've got going on
already so see here I've got your glare
comin right
the point I move do the same thing and I
use my little eyeshadow brush just to
take away the glitter if it's an excuse
nobody does since I got anything my eye
here I have my nabla nude pencil this
thing is brilliant because it's super
late and it sticks to the waterline
really really well so I'm going to just
quickly fill in my waterline make sure
it's nice and light and clear now I'm
going to put some mascara this is my
traxxas mascara first time I ever tried
it was like yesterday and it's five old
tart mascaras are really good but this
one is great I'm going to put a nice
layer of that on first and then the
lashes I'm going to use are at my ghetto
boss lashes from Tarte and this is part
of the neutral collection I have been
using these a lot I have think I've used
them every day since I go home so I've
been you I've used them well over seven
times now and they're still like brand
new so I think it's done a really great
job on the lashes well and making for
those to dry I'm going to quickly go in
with the shade glam again and we're
going to put that in the inner corner so
I'm just using my Smith 2 4 7 brush and
it's nice because it's gold it's not
it's not subtle at all it's like a
proper gold and a corner highlight which
I think contrasts really nicely with the
pink now I'm going to use my heartiest a
large advocator rate so I got this when
I was a wee with in with tar and border
border vlog to come it was the best trip
of my life honestly
so this is like their lash applicator
and oh my goodness the difference it
makes when you put your lashes on it's
crazy so so all you do is you grab your
little launch applicator grab your
lashes so the tweezers are the shape of
your eye and then you just go whoop
done no not really done but what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to get
these tweezers have a little footer a
little so footer is a Scottish word for
like play around with a
- with them I'm going to play around
with them now you all know a good
Scottish word you're welcome amazing and
then what you can do a virtually not
done it with a saying it as you can go
right and at the root and just give them
a squeeze and that means the lashes are
like perfectly close to your own eyeball
so you guys have to finish look in case
you're wondering put my lipstick wise
yeah I'm actually reading Bessie which
is one attires new liquid lip pants as
well so if you try them before this is
like your liquid lipstick version all
that so it doesn't come off it's pull
the cash proof I went swimming with
sharks and never came off it's the best
thing ever I hope you like this look and
I'll see you next time with another
tutorial bye click like click click</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
