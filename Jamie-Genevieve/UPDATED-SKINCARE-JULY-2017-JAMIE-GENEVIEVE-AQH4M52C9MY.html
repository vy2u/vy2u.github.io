I am going to show you what I use a must
base so I've been using transness candy
recently that I'm really really loving
and I've got a few old things in here as
well but you guys wanted an update in
skincare tutorial so here it is so the
first thing I'm gonna talk about is face
masks the first one I have here is the
raw deal
snake oxygenating and cleansing bubble
mask so basically if what you do with us
is it's a sheet mask you put it on your
skin for 10 to 15 minutes until it
bubbles right up then you rub that and
then you wash it off and that is your
face super cleanse so I really like that
the bubbles help support get right into
your pores clean them out it's very good
for cleansing your skin and kind of deep
clogging it if you know what I mean you
might have seen me use one of these in
one of my vlogs I really like them and
if they're fun to use more than anything
but I really do think that the help can
I get most of the dirt and muck in my
skin very good for people to read a lot
of makeup the second and last master
actually got here as the manuka doctor
purifying facial peel so i got this a
few weeks ago now and I've been using it
once or twice a week since then and I
have no ice and my skin is much smoother
my makeup goes on is so much smoother
because it is one of the masks you put
it on you let it drive a little bit 20
minutes and then you peel off from the
chin up so and there is somewhere around
here me put on because it is quite
fascinating and it's a great white mask
so when you put it on it's very opaque
it really can set on the skin really
well and then it dries you can feel it
tighten up you can feel your skin
getting like plumper and then once it's
dry is like paper dries to the touch you
take it off and you pull it from the
chin up which is help the lifting aspect
at the end using this mask my skin
always feels super moisturized it got
medica honey and purified
bee venom in it which is really really
good for your skin both ingredients are
good for your skin after you use those
masks and always feels very moisturize
which is quite different to other masks
I use especially purifying mask
sometimes I say Nebraskan can feel quite
dry but risk and feels super hydrated
super bouncy implants and all the dead
skin
is just gone and it's not sore to take
off you can definitely feel it working
but it's not one of those crazy masks
that you've seen go viral and Facebook
where you're actually an agony taking
off so it's a really easy math use and
then the one of the base are peel-off
masks that are used because I do feel
that can always get that satisfying one
cool sheet so I can like hold up it's
like must be really really late amiss
lately all this would be using this and
relative from everyone the next year for
its of gore are kind of different for me
so I have really cute the Alpha hate
liquid gold with glycolic acid thank God
I read your comments because one of my
subscribers told me that you're normally
to use this twice a day and you're not
really mint use it morning so I like
using this and they type on cotton pad
and a sweeper oil on my skin Greg Clark
acid I think it helps kind of semi peel
your skin so it just helps get rid of
more discs and seals obviously it can
our bust your skin down to the pores
iron is benc and I don't feel like I've
merely released smooth base and in the
morning my skin always looks super super
fresh and it does not make me dry which
is really important I never want what's
going to be dry as you want to know more
details I highly recommend going on the
cult Beauty website because that's what
I bought this and they've got a huge
list of like for guys it's like and then
description bar until you get what it
does but also all that amazing reviews
on this work for me to buy it because
everyone just seems to love it so I've
been used and it's the last couple of
weeks they have the results been happy
and if you watched Mike opt whole you
would have seen that I got a few
products from the ordinary so this is
the advanced
retinoid 2% solution this stuff kind of
freaks me out a little bit because it
with medicine but what I've been doing
is I've just bitten to end a couple or
few drops three drops over my skin at
nighttime and the most important thing
is that you use Sun cream so I have
started using some people what I'm going
to talk about as product because I'm not
use it for long enough I do absolutely
love it so far and this is the tightest
heal your tropic sunscreens like a
primer and it's a sunscreen and I've
been using this every morning and using
this every night so it's like
as I don't know a thousand huge
difference in my skin but for me looking
at my skin I know I cannot remember the
last time it was rescued still not
understand sure of what retinol does but
I do find health it makes your skin
repair itself quicker and I think it
gets rid of all the dead stuff on top I
really don't know as advanced retinoid
2% so I know that that stuff's on a lot
of acne medication but because this is
such a little percentage and pretty sure
it's okay for multiple to use every
single day the reason I like the crisis
one so much it's because it's super
lightweight and makeups it so
beautifully on top of it I'm actually
just ready to do a makeup tutorial where
you can see me using this and yet I
absolutely love it there's a co theory
which is perfect for me because my skin
is pretty used to the sunshine in it's a
nice pad
the next product we will talk about our
serum and oils so as you didn't know
already I have been using these guys
religiously for like I don't know how
long definitely over six months and I've
got the daily advising concentrate and
the midnight recovery concentrate and
these are both from Kiehl's I use daily
everyday and midnight recovery every
single make I put four to five drops on
my hand and a pass on my skin and I
really believe that these are completely
sorted musk in it as far as texture goes
my textures there are pigmentations
there I used to have really provided in
the shown here things like that just
everything seems to be very are using
these guys I also use this on top of
foundation to help at end and that gives
me a really beautiful luminous look all
day the most incredible skin products
I've ever used
my entire life and these will beat with
my skin on my face for the rest of my
life and look at cuteness oh these are
what travel website as we follow these
and there's a tiny tiny tiny little
bottle and I honestly do not know where
you guys can get these bugs sure kills
Kono's if you go in and you charge them
I'm pretty sure that they have these so
if you're making a purchase or even if
you want to try it
they may give you a sachet but these
little guys are like the lake valley
flicker cute they are they're so tiny
the last time sedum aquatic of God I
spoke of it before already at
the high-tech antioxidants dude I've
been using this every day I use it as
passwords mask and actually use it
morning and night so I'm going to
perform a foundation and I will use it
this for my moisturizer at night time I
have been really loving it I think it
just helps my skin glow and work called
Quentin glow
so it's hydrated and emitters can go I
should beautiful it got so much stuff
first full of peds encapsulated
superoxide dismutase tea
I don't know what I mean vermin see any
little botanicals you use as a hydration
living piece and your skin wardrobe is
that not like that feels it for me so I
got this in her copy of olive oil I've
been using it every single day since
then I absolutely love it
next I have a little eye cream and I
actually been using this trailer
legislate center Goya I'm really running
out and it's called this super multi
corrective eye opening sedum from
Kiehl's also and the reason I like that
so much it completely works
it helps Beasley corn tear your eyes so
good for people who like real makeup
especially if you feel like your legs
are starting to drift
I'm noise when I do my eyeliner my eyes
are starting to change
freaking me but basically the difference
between this and other items as you can
use this I see them all over your lids
and you can actually see it just keeps
everything nice and taut and it's
probably one of the only items are most
appropriate difference and I'm going to
continue to use this for sure the next
thing I've got is really fine this and
from the K beauty section and full of
beautiful it's called bio peel plus
advanced treatment and this is the gold
peeling Wayne promotes visibly clear
direct smoother and tighter skin I
absolutely love it it smells like
nothing else I've ever tried my entire
life oh can I found a bit like like
great sweets they are pies that are
really cool they've got a little bit for
you to put your fingers in there side
here is like cotton and essayed here as
it's fully and and I always use one of
those a day usually at nighttime to make
sure that my makeup completely off you
gets very in a box you should think of
it it's like one of these a month and
you
see I'm late a third of the way down
fabulous
I don't think that when I was traveling
I wish I had because they really do make
your skin just feels so smooth and smell
great and gluey
and stunning the last face skin product
I've got as the Kate Somerville
eradicate obviously got the miles on one
from a copy and if you guys want to know
my thoughts on it
I think it's nice but I basically think
it's a pure man's version of a I've had
best for the longest time and I'm still
watched so much less in it so it's
definitely worth the money
and this is what you do is you get a
little cotton bison in there and you
just put all your blemishes plainly
appear I usually do it in late paint and
by the next morning the blemish is
definitely going down in a considerable
mode or it's gone so I use those
profusely shows
you can see here I've got a little one
that still kind of clean it up but it
never came to anything because they use
this on it I kind of swear by this it's
fabulous
and then it's Brazilian black volume
look at this that one fill and that one
still if I ever run out at eyes I'm
going to have a complete milquetoast
I use a every single day I put it pretty
much all through my body obviously
called bum bum team if you haven't
smelled it yet you need to
it smells like quality says born Brazil
and fused with all powerful guarana
extract and basically it moisturizes
your skin very intensely and it makes
your skin feel tight oh it will smoother
like my arms are so smooth nose trim
using those and my tan usually doesn't
last very well but it does the first
stuff overly does and I use that all
over my arms my legs my bum my stomach
my boobs everything I literally it from
here down
I am completely caught within it and I
also have the body spray that smells
like air and the shower cream versus
probably my favorite brand at the moment
called beauty it silver side but they
also sell a really cute little travel
money I have two of those as well and
I'll just fill it up from a big one spin
a run it's so good for traveling but
anyone who's not tried as ice melters
please do go to Jimmy saying yet and
they'll completely understand to
moisturizers to show you I have the cata
illuminating moisturizer I also got this
from a cult beautiful and I've been
using it pretty much every day when I
wear makeup so when I remember I use
this as a little primer
I'll put this on and then I'll put my
SPF on top they don't seem like a lot of
products but skin to your works when you
layer it okay as like slightly tinted
and it just gives the most gorgeous
luminous finish and it smells great it
smells like spa so I have been using
that and I have been loving it and in
the last when I've got to show you and
the unisex healthy google it called all
year hydrating summer tent moisturizer
and I've seen one of these like this
before when basically when you squeeze
out it looks great and then when you
start blending in it turns into skin
color but there and it completely warms
up your complexion it looks super
natural it gives a nice cool so I used
on my feet and we're not wearing makeup
so when I'm not going to makeup I'll
chop some of us and go to the house and
I've actually had compliments on my skin
when I've got that on like so in awesome
because people just think my so
much--but he'll fit and unisex angles so
you guys that is all I'm going to
bombard you with today that was a lot of
skincare products but that is what I've
been using and that is what seems to
work for me I decided to do this video
with absolutely no makeup on the client
or what did you guys to see what my skin
is looking like in a moment for a
reference and my skin is probably
combination to oily but I like to keep
my skin super hydrate as let me know
what you think if you like videos like
this please do let me know I really do
like showing you guys my new favorite
bangs are talking about beauty products
and makeup products that I love is just
like the most exciting thing for me so
yeah let me know if you like this and
other than that I will see you next time
