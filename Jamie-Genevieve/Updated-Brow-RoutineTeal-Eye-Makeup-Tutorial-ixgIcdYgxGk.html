I sat down and thought hey you know what
I've changed the way I do my eyebrows
why don't I show you guys how I do my
eyebrows now and use them pretty much
the same products as before but I've
slightly different technique and then I
went to do my eye makeup and I don't
know what was going to do so I just
started pecking random things at my
drawers and that's happened so I thought
why not record this as well at the same
time so I hope you guys like it and if
you'd like to see how I created this
look stitching and also I mean as well
see right now if you will happen to
notice how majestic my highlight is it's
because of this it's because all this
Anastasio Beverly Hills glucose I'll
link it down below actually you know
what I'm going to show you one thing
really quickly okay I don't even need to
see more okay I just I just I'll leave
the link down below for you and you can
you can go and have a look and yeah hope
you like it slick okay so I've slightly
changed how I do my eyebrows and I'm
going to show you how I do the night I
think before I use the same kind of
product but I used to go in quite hazy
I'm the first thing I do is always to go
out the side refinished and as I wrote
not I'm going to comb through my bro
heroes with a spoolie so this is just on
the end of an Anastasio brush that I
like to use just like that okay now I've
got my anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
pomade and dark gray and I think this
brush has made a big difference to the
owner
it's an Anastasio number seven brush and
it's like the dual ended brush and I
think it's like stable fibers but it's
pretty good I hope it'll I ie like a lot
so first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to get a little bit of that blow
on my brush and I'm gonna
fellow at the end of my blow first so
I'm going to connect over exaggerate my
arch as well okay I think one of the key
points of this product is just using a
pain a bit at a time you don't need much
of a product at all
have a play around make sure that the
products make sense fill the whole way
through the end of the blow
make sure there's no bits in my saying
don't worry about your bro being too
neat at the moment because I still like
to carve out my brows with concealer so
yeah so I would leave the interpreter
there and they the biggest change to my
droves mode is I used to fill in the
front quite a lot no all I do is this so
I gave web Rose left over on my brush
and I just can uh I just cannot draw a
line under my bro here and then I just
fell in the like the little naked bets
the bets isn't all here glowing and then
I just kind of connect it the top just
like that I think this is a really nice
way to get obviously a sculpted throw
but differently in that natural I think
makes it look so much better in
obviously I'll probably change her mind
about two months and hate these but
right now I'm digging it
once your bro is mostly fell down I take
the duck bro and I hid away we don't
need that anymore no I'm gonna use as
Mac and that says the studio finish
concealer in nw20 and I don't use that
much Mac to be honest but I was in the
Turner a couple months ago and one of
the girls in there with who was working
her brows were insane and ice what she
sculpted a my breath and she said this
it's why I bought it
she looks incredible and all I'm going
to do now is carve out my brows at the
entire way underneath I'll do that first
and I'm just using a zoeva brulee in
brush now I'm going to get another
little bit product and then I'm going to
cover at the top of my plate but I'm
going to start around here and just do
the teal once you've done that I'm going
to grab my zoeva concealer buffer brush
and I'm just going to blend that out
okay
sufficiently carved out and and then
just to finish off I'm going to use the
benefit gimme brow and this is a product
that I've been using quite a lot
recently I really like it and I'm just
going to go through the end of my brow
first just to get red velvet more to
that product on there and let's light
the texture here as well but it just
makes them look really nice and neat and
tidy and then I'm going to use whatever
left on the brush and I'm just going to
comb these hairs up great like so let's
move on to eyes so I'm gonna grab my
landlord Mac Paint Pot and I don't
really use soft ochre or painterly
anymore I just much prefer this torn
em you'll see that it seems go on and
I'm just going to use a lid of that all
over the lid I just think this is a lot
picture so for me who advocates Alice
can obviously in the pigmentation I get
on my legs is really purple so that I
thought that this color really lifts
that I'm just gonna use it underneath my
eye as well yeah I really only do prefer
this to soft ochre obviously if I was
doing a really light I make up soft
ochre openings but I just I like this a
lot and I'm going to just get a big
fluffy brush this is a morphe in b23 and
I'm using from eyeballs I'm using the
chocolate - what - v semi-sweet
chocolate bar and the colors I'm going
to be using are it's fine
this one this one this one and this one
and this one most of it so I'm going to
go in with the lightest shade first this
is cocoa cream and it's just a just
something to mattify everything down so
I'm just using the back fluffy brush oh
my god every time I use this I cannot
believe how good it smells see this and
yeah so I'm just buffing that light
matte color all over so it mattifies
everything down and just makes
everything easier to blend I feel and
then I'm going to go in with peanut
butter which is like a really warm brown
color and I'm going to school on a top
just in my crease and then where I'm
wiping away excess product and I'm just
going to blend that into the concealer
so there's no lines belting that color
up but by been using side side motions
and in little circular motions when I
want to blend upwards now I'm going to
do is I'm going to change my brush and
I'm not lying I'm going to go in with
the color truffled which is like a dark
a darker matte right in still quite warm
though I am and I'm just going to go and
the crease again but not a color and I'm
wiping off the excess on my pajama
bottoms and then I'm just going to blend
that again I'm just going to use NSA to
the brush just to diffuse any lines
okay I'm going to go in with my favorite
brush of all time as we've our two to
four brush looks defined crease and I'm
going to go with that dark brown shades
again a little bit heavier so I'm just
going to go and right in the crease and
the over crease just like that perfect
okay let's start going underneath I know
I'm I'm going to go and grab another
eyeshadow this is Illamasqua eyeshadow
an intense I don't know if this is
discontinued or actually but Ella masks
are really good for any kind of great
colors that you're looking for and I'm
just going to use eyeshadow brush to
buff that under my eyeball
oh no wonder I couldn't see flippin
better protector oh it's like getting
laser eye surgery I've got ten it is
going on so bad right now this you okay
once I've got that color on I'm going to
switch over to my favorite over brush
again and we're going to go in with the
shade blueberry swirl which is literally
the only blue shows all in this pilot
okay better that and that just makes it
really nice and kind of surety holy okay
so see if you did this back so then I
just grab my concealer buffing brush and
kind of buff I'll be about thanked all
that work fine I don't think I was going
to happen to forum with you okay back
from the blue Buddhist what else nice
now I'm going to do is I'm going to take
the new makeup geek Phil perspective
pencil that this is pencil in ocean and
I'm going to put that right in my
waterline and I'm bringing it slightly
further down as well wow that is in
really nice I'm not gonna lie to you
know I've had it in this water line for
about an hour because obviously made a
snack before I filmed this side and and
it's not moved at all good
okay now what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna grab at just any other fluffy
brush and I'm just going to slightly
dark in the corner of my eye so I'm
mixing the warm shade of brown and the
darker shade of blue I'm just going to
pop that right on in there good
okay now for something pretty exciting
in this is the dose of colors ideal
jewel so it comes with pigment
underneath and then you've got a primer
on top so obviously some had these so I
bought these and I'm really not
disappointed at all
amazing so I've got their height on a
brush and I'm just going to pop the
primer on where I'm going to put the
pigment even the primer the look at that
stunning I hope you're happy that I'm
recording by the okay so I'm just
popping that pigment on it's pretty
creamy so you can kind of blend that out
as you're going I know I'm just going to
close that you turn it and there we go
and it's pretty messy I'm not gonna lie
but I just use whatever is left on the
top so just going to grab that with
other side of my brush and put on and
this is the shade desk school and then
I'm wearing kind of dust excess off of
my hand and then I'm just going to
connect use this edge of this brush to
blend though I feel like this is my
clearer than this side maybe I fit more
kiddin attention to it okay so I'm just
going to use say to this brush just tip
your over and let me grab the tarte
precision liner and this is like I feel
tip I am obsessed with and I'm just
going to do I'll lay it on top of my eye
for my lashes
ah what makes I guess that's gone on the
pajama bottoms as well no all the slaves
do is put on some mascara and lashes and
I'm going to do that off camera because
we all know how to do that and that's
finished look okay guys that is the
finished look I hope you like that and
