draw on behalf of your ivory that you've
shaved off so although I think I want to
say a month ago I received from you'll
see it in the video if you watch the
film thing but I've shaved from about
here onwards off of my brows because
they were just they were tail all down
and they were just it was a hit being in
a creative box I can do anything with
them
so shave them off and I've been
practicing and can every day trying
different kind of styles and stuff like
that of how I can draw my droids
backwards so today I've gotten four
great harsh look quite harsh but street
art in the mirror before they used to
come a lot for their doughnut so you can
kind of see we used to come down here
crazy wild so if you would like to see
how I draw on my brows stay tuned thank
you so much for watching
starting off with my Thunder bloke eek
by Illamasqua
and mixing it with a little bit of water
I draw a line extending from the lure
bit of my eyebrow and I join up by
creating an arch as well the cause I'm
using the product way is a lot darker
and it's quite piece like so you can
make it really quite thick as well and
as my product gets less and less on the
brush and move towards the front of the
brow and brush it up through the here
because I like I cannot sleep feed
through my bro Azrael
just using an angle brush for this and
going over and over oh the end of the
both you get it nice and dark and making
sure that the Sheep is near what I like
then I go in with my concealer this is
Kevin a cornet skin enhancer and SX or
four with a clean angle brush and I go
right around the perimeter of the brow
just to neaten up and make sure it's the
exact shape that I would like then using
the Ziva concealer buffing brush I'm
just going to blend the concealer and to
my foundation it's a little bit later
about use that as a highlight so it's
okay then going on with mac highlighter
and perfect topping i just bought a
little bit under the arch of my brow as
a shimmer highlight and that's how i do
it my new eyebrows i hope you liked it
and learn something kill i'll see you
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
