we are going to go over my new and
improved contour routine featuring el
America's new innovative products the
gel sculpt and gel color so these are
this is a quarter and a blushed a
product that I have been trying out
before at launch Ives I've been trying
to get the last three days I saw and
when I mentioned that that's what I was
juice and I got tons of you wouldn't
know how to use it because it's a bit
different than any other kind of contour
product so I thought I would comply I
thought I would do what you asked me to
do and so yeah I'm gonna do pretty much
my field fees and I've makeup apart from
my eyes which is the zoeva rose gold
palette by the way if you want to know
it's beautiful to me you say we're gonna
go over these and I'm going to show you
how to my foundation Tobias apply them
in a natural way for daily wear and my
usual cannot contour style which is a
little bit heavier elements a goody
thing that they've brought these over
cause before no contour has always been
my heavy seriously visible which I am
all about don't get me wrong but this is
a really great product for our
absolutely everybody and even for meal
crewmen things like that it's gonna look
phenomenal sore I'm all for this product
and I hope you liked this video and find
it helpful and I will see you next week
with another one
bye so I've got a completely clean face
normally Kapaun apart from my brows and
my eye makeup and lately I've been using
this Urban Decay b6 vitamin infused
complexion Tripps place or a little
swish that and then as normal I'm gonna
apply my foundation which is skin B
Alaska can be sin 8.5 I would have
bought that or an all-over attritional
and I'm just using my makeup addiction
cosmetics brushes
their Arctic process and this is the duo
fiber brush and I just used s to put my
makeup on and Oliver and I don't want
eat too much food my blending because
I'm going to go over it with a sponge
which is matte blue thing so when I have
that fairly evenly distributed
distributed on my face I went with my
sponge this is the do your sponge and my
effect suppliers gave a sponge obviously
and then beauty plan didn't I find that
the ISTEP really helps with the
longevity of my foundation it lasts all
day when I do that so I do that spire so
it's almost like I'm kind of bouncing
the sponge off my skin rather than
dragging it and I got laid between my
brows focusing mainly on the areas in
the center of the face where the
foundation would slip and it's really
good forget and underneath your eyes and
Blaine's in the makeup so it doesn't
like ruin your eye makeup
you feel like you want a little bit more
coverage in the standard videos I pick
up a little bit of the foundation with
my sponge and I just apply it straight
on and it's let my sponge over and use
the flat end and just place there and
and no onto the product that we want to
talk about so these are the new LMS jail
sculpt and jail color so I've got the
jail slips here which is what we use
first and silhouette and the packages
I'd say it almost looks like a can a
larger-than-life lipstick take off the
top and you've got your other V LEDs
here you need to keep that one isolated
and don't think that those kids but I
managed to save me so you take off your
stations wheel it and that just keeps it
really hydrated because it's in her as a
beautiful product it smells it smells
amazing smell fresh but you need the
second lid just to keep all the moisture
done because it's and it's quite like a
water-based products which makes it just
look really fresh in the skin so color
wise or sure yeah the color looks a bit
it's quite strange open up for us all
these I wasn't sold at all and then zuly
my brand ambassador she came up and
showed me how to use it and I absolutely
loved it absolutely all over that saw
first of all you can apply it as if you
put it on the palm of your thumb like so
I'm sure it comes together and then you
apply it by bouncing that off your
cheekbone and that just gives you such a
subtle
diffused looking contour so for people
that are once contour but they don't
want to be like proper Arceus drag
according to our this is five so you can
belt this up as much as you like and
I'll use the same technique just back on
the thumb put more on veins the thumbs
together and you can just choose that
roans your
forehead contour for it so it's honestly
is one of the easiest contour products
that I've used I think especially if
you're gonna playing it this way
remember this is the first with you I
said I'll play it so a little bit the
earth will be bit more you see that
super subtle and easy and it's really
easy to do on yourself as well because
you can feel exactly where you're meant
to push the product and you can feel
like your hand almost cuts you're doing
cheekbones and then again reapply and
it's a guy really is cool and sensation
on the skin as well so Bunch Prime's
together and a little bit around your
jawline and that's products inflation
off and kind of unnoticeable that you
don't need to worry about any lines or
anything okay so that is what I would
call a really natural contour really
what you do now is you can wear with
your bronze iron your blush of as usual
and then you just got yourself a really
nice natural contour personally me be me
I want more so the way I found I like it
as if I get the stack and draw a line
and then blend it with my sponge so
let's try the so that makes it super
dark
that's more my stale okay
and obviously you can do it like as many
others as you like if you want it super
dark I'm sure if you're just gonna keep
on going I say I'm going to do the
others food now
nice so I personally think that really
easy probably use your fingers even just
it can it diffuse it a little bit more
if you like and something else that I
like too and it's going back with my
foundation brush and just clean and up
the edge just make it a little bit
sharper so I'm gonna go in a little bit
heavier on my forehead so just doing
little things like and then again with
my sponge which still has a bit of
foundation on it which I think might be
help in planes but I do think this is
such an easy product to use and then
again I would have all about heavier on
my jaw when you're applying straight
from this deck is where it just feels so
good really really cooling on the skin
and then Zoe showed me a really neat
little check with every right you use
your finger and you Joe it's only said's
of your finger with the gel product and
then give your fingers a little up
together if it was really natural North
concert you just finish the top bring it
down and then I'm just gonna clean that
end but that's just lovely it's like a
barely there nose contour you wouldn't
really be able to tell that I've done
that so I like it so that is the contour
and because it's the gel product it's
quite sheer so you can still see your
skin through it and I think that's what
makes this project so lovely is that you
can still see your skin behind according
to alex box who helped treat this
product who is the creative director of
illamasqua say it herself that she
thinks this is the next newbie to corner
because contours before of all
been very ma and heavy and visible in
the scan we chose this as like a natural
shadow and if you're reading to it color
don't be worried because we have transit
on the pay list of scans and even like
the darkest this get ins on beautiful
turns people it still shows up really
nice so I hope you give that a little
try the next product I'm gonna show you
is the jail color can a blush which this
one is called charm and it's a beautiful
kind of tangerine color again seen a
product seen leo take the little top lid
off and this looks super great even on
the back of my hands it comes across
really really brave but same thing as
before and I would use it this way I
would never apply the street Orden
because it is right so apply it to the
pantyhose I mean you don't need as much
product so a little couple of stands and
press my palms together and I'm dust
fishing that on on top you can see like
about the contour on the Canet mostly
she is part of my cheek and that's just
most men to give you like the most kind
of convincing blush which I usually view
I think it looks beautiful
regrettably bit heavier because I love
me some blush and there is another color
that's a beautiful pink but because I
spring/summer coming
I am planning getting some tan I just
think that corals just cool with can
warm my skin tone so lovely here so I am
super happy with that I'm going to go
ahead and finish my skin care and my
skin routine here we go so my is a
Weaver highlighter brush I'm going with
my Mac dark tan bronzer what I used to
use and I'm just going to connive hug my
pointer and bring up a little bit
and I really like the way the peridot is
still on top of them as well I thought
they would maybe stick a weirdly but
he's doing it all
and then just to go over my highlight
I'm not actually done anything highlight
too late like concealer or anything I'm
just gonna let my natural it's gonna be
my highlight and gone ever Mac soft and
gentle beautiful very popular
highlighting products and the same brush
I use for my blonde so the Watts
highlight brush and just gonna highlight
down the center of the nose which works
so well with the nose contour some new
foods I just love the way that the light
reflects this highly are so beautiful
and obviously I am all about that
highlight leaf so feel free not to put
on as much as I do but I like to glue
like the Sun and then just to finish
that off a little bit of loose powder i
always use Elemis kalus powder because
as Libous
and then just to finish the whole it all
I'm going to are we washing or full
lipstick by Mac no liner I'm not really
doing later
these days it's crazy I just want I can
attach a color focus on the eyes in the
scan mostly saw
I've taught you choose my right a bit
later on and again if you don't know
this check no you know I have been using
the Rimmel eyebrow pencil and dark brown
as I let play now and it's phenomenal
it's so good the product just goes on
straight away I wash and it's quite a
good universal when I oh I always tend
to use dark brown but well you know
Saudi I've got a cat visiting me and his
hairs are all over my face
and that is the finished look I hope you
guys like it hope I helped these new
products from Illamasqua the jail sculpt
in silhouette and the jail blush and
charm are just gorgeous really nice new
