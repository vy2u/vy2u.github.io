wait you can get it good boy
yes yes I'm so good what today
I don't know if it's been work I have
never personally filmed fell driving for
and I have a bad feeling of this
countess can go right across the dash so
if that happened then we in filming know
more great as cameras giving me the fear
of life also I would like to point out
that my car is very military and a few a
frequent watcher you will know that I
stopped smoking took not much useful yet
like a week and a half ago which i think
is pretty good and today I don't have
any patch on I don't have a patch on
your STD I though I don't have a
vaporizer or seek secondary to help and
literally doing this all by myself all
by myself
and so yeah before then I would smoke
non slow up in my car but now I don't I
treat myself a Yankee Candle in cherry
black cherry smell and my characters
notion that I saw and we will get about
it and they don't have like a new car
and cause of what smoking it will
probably rather clean if anyone's
wondering what can occur or for as many
and it has pretty much been run into the
ground by yours truly I am a bit
stressed out in case other drivers can
see my little camera facing me and know
what I'm doing
look alive if I saw someone talking to
himself in the car I'd be like you're
crazy
don't mind me just open the shop like a
pro we have sex makeup stations in here
this is mine hey there hey guys and CA
this is where I do makeup today I'm
doing a tour lesson I'm there's a pound
for me yeah so I'm gonna go to a lesson
I'm not gonna film that the cause she
might not want to be filmed I'm gonna go
I'm gonna clean my brushes trying to
heat it on because it's absolutely
Baltic in here I'm gonna go I'm gonna
tidy up get myself set up and make up
some emails so when I put a time and
then I will see you guys when I am
driving through to Gleneagles be
exciting her bye
and is so pretty
so I just pulled up in the car park and
this is the Porsches please I've ever
been in my entire life
if I let's go in that for flappin Grand
Hotel I don't know what I'm going
somebody just drove past me in a Lambo
so I am Jeff it was start my car and I
am just out of my spire that was the
best thing ever so I had to be out and I
was just like great so being at the
place in square a good few times I put
Leo and I was like really good in
Scotland / Glasgow / for a row - or for
a spa and everyone has seen places to
date and better I do like Edinburgh but
it's really hard to get parked and yeah
I don't know who it yeah I do like him
dad it's just really hard to get parked
and I've been there before so I was kind
of thinking free is good there's going
to be good and I got a called Naima
posted saying that she works in a
section for Glenny gold and that is
amazing and I think I thought I was like
weirdest clinicals again and then I
realized that it's literally half an
hour away from her I grew up so I
thought cultivars are one stone to
myself to aspire but also we'll see my
family
so bastard is knocking - Gleneagles she
is the sweetest I came out to pee and
she left a little bag of goodies for me
to try and also hello Kyra said good
luck with your operation which made me
410 tearful M my god the only thing
about this place right okay
I loved that mist I was in Cairo
everyone was so nice there's a lady
who's here he was like a member so she's
obviously a fancy lady and remember
there's a man back to these kind of
places
so yeah she was socialized she helps me
kinda like if we were to go and stuff
because obviously I've never been
perfect it was incredible my masseuse
was called handout so see if you're ever
going to Gleneagles for a spa get there
I got the source to the source massage
it's pretty amazing but it's also very
expensive so it's two hours long as
Tara's I'm thinking I guess it's going
to be amazing
pay much we're by going to intelligently
proceed to the moon I am trying to
proceed to the route I'm gonna go to
sleep okay aim this yeah it was training
careful I feel a hundred percent relax
Dave we're just going as I was a wee bit
nervous about operation I was just going
to be about not anxious
so yeah that was like the best thing
ever I would all just know because I am
slightly concerned that I'm going the
wrong direction slash been to kill
myself so and I have draw from
Gleneagles to tell Cody which is for my
mum dad and my aunty and cousins and
everyone stays um excuse you my mother
the a so I feel completely understand
chilled out Gleneagles is such a nice
place
even though is proper fancy I feel
completely at home there I did not feel
like comfortable in the slightest
everyone that was in the spire seemed to
just be having a nice time
obviously in the spa yeah it was the
best it was such an ethic video I'm
sorceress to know so I'm obviously
having a black coffee to help my first
you can't believe that it's half a sex
at me already I feel like I've been all
going on sought by AM all I'm going to
do now is we're going to have dinner and
I'm going to drive home so the drive
from here to home is bitten hour and 20
minutes and I rode from feeling quick so

then I've got tomorrow which is when I'm
get my hair done and I've got one more
lesson and then it's lady is my
