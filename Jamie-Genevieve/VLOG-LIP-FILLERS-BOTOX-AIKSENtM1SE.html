in my space in the bed to have a nice
nap and there's nothing I can do about
it
thanks dog Bo good morning I'm still
waking up I said I am NOT doing my
makeup today I will tell you why I am
going it's just about Nana call come
mornin just know I sweat then I've
haven't created jeans and just wanted to
read them out you know yeah I'm going to
the bill forum to get my tough cuts so I
am this is not going to be able ideal
for everybody let's just say that if
you're interested in the process and
what it's like to get your lips and
Botox then that's great you can keep on
watching if you're generally just quite
interested and all a lot of people
they've probably never gather themselves
watch these videos because it's a bit
squeamish and yeah if you are not
interested in it and you think it's
stupid or and II think I'm too young and
I don't need it that's fine but I'm
going to ask you not to watch this and
not to leave negative comments because
there is nothing worse in telling
someone that you don't know what they do
or do not need and that's something I
learned when I was going through the
pieces to get my boob job and the moment
people had told me usually to see me you
don't need em in a nice women and an
Auton a Spears well people just say you
don't need out your fame
I've actually got issues and I actually
I'm really struggling with me I look
you're saying oh wait
excuse me I was wanted to just add you
up because I get asked so many questions
but free to get them done what it's like
as it's sore so I just decided that I
was going to it's log it and the reason
we're going to make up is because plain
I'm getting a lot done it's obviously
right around here so now let's take a
little air earth can a foundation a and
and Botox it depends on for results
you're wanting but I gay
it in the middle road my eyes and my
forehead done which is pretty much
everywhere oh yeah I'm so excited I'm
getting it the last time I had it done
was like four months ago
okay hello people we long ago before
they get it redone and I love it so I
don't make to it I'm rather impatient oh
my god that one here will not come out
my face so I'm really going to do is put
some moisturizer at all and it put a
little bit of glow State through my
eyebrows and I'm gonna put a little tiny
bit of coverage in the center of my face
maybe just to cover anything I don't
know okay
I'm not I'm gonna be rephrased a baby I
can feel weird that I just took my hair
in my ball ball but I had to show you
that the next lemonade in liquid
eliminator okay I have nothing on my
face at all apart from nothing and look
we have turned out to be oh how to
highlight when you're not even wear
makeup
yup it's amazing this is also for Drogba
neurosis set and he just sits there and
like say the window don't you George oh
boy do you want go for a walk yeah yeah
oh boy straight big straight do the
rechecking leg thing ha ha
did you over the walk yeah oh you saw
hands dropper are you ready are you
ready
precious precious sweet inter okay so
I've what sob he's in his breakfast no
job but doesn't like tea is reckless
first driver likes to eat a bit of it
then go for a walk and come back and
finish it it's so strange
please let me know as normal or if I
should be concerned and a box dog I'm
just waiting to go as half 9:00 and my
appointments at half past ten there
clinic in Louisville forum is on Wilson
Street in town which is unlike Glasgow
City Centre pretty much I live like 15
minute drive I'm so excited so my lips
I've had them done four times day I'm
first I've gotten done I've got half a
mil of Juvederm Smail which is quite a
soft product second came was a film L of
Juvederm Smail and then the two times
after that I've had a film L of Juvederm
fee which is FOMO it really depends on
who you go to what you're going to end
up looking like I know I've seen a few
people they've had somewhere amount of
product to me and their lips are wild
like not invasive a I don't think Botox
brain is totally run off so I can
scrunch up my own between rubriz
I can read my brows and get my legs back
so people the thing about Botox is it
can be used as preventative which is
exactly what I'm using it for so instead
of waiting until the lanes and my
forehead in the meeting my eyebrows are
quite deep I'm getting Botox now so I
would I'm not really giving them a
chance to get the if you know what I
mean this is something for me that's
totally changed the way I look I'm gonna
insert some pictures here of the way I
used to look you may be surprised that's
because in general they are bad pictures
of me anyway and I think I was about
nineteen when those pictures were taken
so I thank the deference and see when I
smile I still have my lips and I like
not having to overlay my lips as well so
when I first get my lips done I won't
over line them so I'm really excited to
get them done again so this is just in a
little morning
hope everyone's seen hi hi hi hi hi hi
oh you guys are the best
hahaha and I just thought I'd introduce
Peter Scott family to the YouTube family
and that is at the Bell forum I'm going
to do that vlogging in public is a bit
mortifying but we're here
I think this is my favorite place in the
entire world you know so this is my
second home
and this is for your lord of works law
Tamela this young beautiful angel here
I'm aboard runnin she won an award for a
bassist a sex that right yeah yeah I'm
and yeah she is the person who I come to
for my fellow and that's what we're
going to just do and some Botox
oh my god way too dark in the South
Florida I'm about pricing it's not been
here for a while and for lips is 250 for
a film eligible don't see which is why I
get and for Botox it goes in Elios so
because I get one two three areas it's
300 pounds so 550 or line and so this is
what you can expect to look like am i
have numbing cream all over my face are
we doing will loop it numb and came on
my botox packs and my buddies you really
want it but we've also I think I got it
last
thanks as easy as anything am so a lot
of people ask me with pain I don't think
I'm the best person to ask because I
think I'm quite good for pain but in
it's not sore as wee bit uncomfortable
would you say yeah but nappy it's more
like I water than anything else in I saw
quite a few go if flake of laughter's to
perk work that's why I think one of
these is I like her so much and so I'm
ending no really in bridge in porridge
and fresh Botox her lips yeah we'll talk
to you have lots of testing on yeah so
really the Q minus norm as possible and
then Duchess nuns like I've also taken
my be pure tonight in and of course
dropper one like it's like a retainer
I'm just gonna shove in afterwards and
then I'll tackle get in that bar through
my lips again later because that's hard
in so we're gonna do Botox first and
then relax will be nice and um and then
we'll doing my lips I'm getting claims
hmm so it's nice and sanitized this is
what you get
do please guys clean and relax
it's funny see when you've got your
knowing chemo and they feel 10 teens
burger old Athey I feel annoyed ahead
and run but I get Botox and between my
face I get Botox right in my eyes and
then I gave in my forehead as well so I
get is that the filth walk really CEOs
in what is it that you do if you want to
blow left
I love you ask me that so best muscle
years ass ocular muscle looking jokes
and here caption part it and inject over
here that's not a little laughs like
that not muscle lifts like that put it
in together a roller and that's muscle
relaxants don't Louie okay if you want a
pro-life donítí avoid your forehead
okay so I mean if you just get your
forehead done sometimes what can happen
is your braids can draw up is that right
yes it's very unusual so you'll always
the brightest anyway it's only all we're
gonna talk a Malamute afternoon which is
fine any old person if you'd already
here to here and that's talks you're
going to need a very selective and who
I'll do the forehead dim who's suitable
for that and other people of course we
confuse the fortieth but they will link
the result that they get for this if you
do that and but you also do this does
that stop the drop happening else and
our Caravan access so you can left as
much as you want as soon as you to
access muscle relaxants don't doing so
you're going to counteract something
you're just never very careful with
foreheads and people are heavy and
eyelets Eagle you thrown harder to come
by angry face skip go oh it's still it's
like going to the dentist when your
videos get tool to get around wax and
raise the eyebrows up part as you can
and I even use marking a to just money
when where your muscles bulging the most
and okay I'm gonna inject and screw you
guys up and if you can you only got a
lot of dogs on you
because you don't have much course kill
and again I just want to catch these me
you I use yeah and I think it's been
about four months since I got it done
last time so there's probably still some
life they will ask me before once is
that actually only ok please one might
people get a lot of that one go I mean
it just depends when like Ally to get my
movement as soon as your start moving
you freeze out of it - it's a little
wings but hmm I mean like I think my
like - probably last a long time though
because I've got so much product and the
media which is great
oh so I just an enema mapping for six
months is national coast-to-coast which
I have top Kate off mostly lastly the
longer no that's good good good get a
little camera mm-hmm good kiddo can I
talk because I could annoy you at all so
I am a bleeder which I'm feeling read
off it's because I'm so so got I'm
healthy
mmm-hmm blood asked me if I was and I
did I need but to sport I play six I was
like no lasting sword one kettle I mean
what I since or it's not so it's
honestly just like a real challenge it's
been nothing but it's not it's not sort
I mean what's that stuff just Annika I
just always like to go you Veronica
so hopefully you won't get any read or
she didn't agree with me but I just
always put in articles just to stop you
through just any bruising killing me it
isn't clean this is funny because I've
never seen this happening before
I'm seen an outlet and you see know that
if you throw in harder she can create a
buzz if you do that consistently or what
the book talks on a wee bit quicker
because I remember the last time I had
this done I've said to you should I try
and keep your cell as possible and you
really know so I should just do this
yeah so the next five days
keep it going I'm sure the lycée my
start to sleep results out there but
four days because as I before leave a
cracker throat okay so because Botox is
a medication that's why it takes longer
so your substrate I'm like I learned
anger yes oh yeah I fell was just a Jo
you're injecting sorts of the medication
so it takes ten it been to the base of
it a scepter and you usually don't see
it and if you've had the core talk
before you see it my birthday for to d7
you've not had it before t1 gonna see
anything for selfies yeah I look like
clever you're out of it as stuff okay

on your period you will bleed more than
your drugs walking and it's more painful
but it's not even peeing pal you can't
seen that yeah don't go don't get a gun
if you don't appear period is it just
not worth it it's just I say it's a
question emotional on your legs I hate
