an exciting D I'm actually quite nervous
but mmm Charlotte it's just a bit to
come pick me up I'm going to try some
dresses on today I'm really excited I'm
going to illa Danza and Glasgow which is
like a nice bridal shop kara is amazing
she boots her appointment and basically
when you book an appointment you can I
pick your staler dresses that you like
and Cara knows exactly what candidates
are looking for so she did that kind of
wishlist thing so they know exactly what
kind of Josas I want to try all and so I
think what happens is when you get there
it's kind of pulled like dresses that do
you think that would suit the kind of
seem or whatever I don't really know I
don't think I'm gonna film anything
today this is like my first trying on a
dresses and stuff like that I don't
really want anyone to see me in a
wedding dress apart from like my close
friends and my mum and that's pretty
much it so I don't think I'm actually
going to be doing any vlogging of me
trying on dresses I'm sure you guys
understand it's just not something I
feel like I want to do like because then
that means Jack when he's ed and will
see me in a wedding dress you'll see
exactly what I look like which I'm like
no I can't have that little bit
surprised so I'm just gonna go our
appointment to ten and then afterwards

lunch and then when I get home I am
gonna film a little video for youtube
