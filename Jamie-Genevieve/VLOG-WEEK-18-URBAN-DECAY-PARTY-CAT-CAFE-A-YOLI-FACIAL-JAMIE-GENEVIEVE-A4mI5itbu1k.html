weeks ago and at that time we kind of
got salt Jane said really well 13 inches
long flexible and swishy we're just
having some lunch and so when I was here
three weeks ago
this time we're super okay we're doing
the IPS or and having lunch badgering
guys I don't know if you remember but I
actually wasn't here every two weeks
with Jack really really want to comment
if we wanted to come to the cat cafe but
we don't have time
hello and it's been absolutely Jo since
I just said and sports to you guys I
feel like I've been vlogging every side
in it but I've not just not been talking
as much and I'll tell you why in New
York I got bit in allies by the schools
and I don't leave friend Kenneth Norfolk
but there's a bait on my ankle and I
think flying doesn't help but basically
my whole leg has swirl right up and it's
been prey a guinea but not only kind of
only can I was like hey I need to get
this or activity when I takes my dad and
I was like dad something is wrong and I
went and I got some medicine I'm feeling
a lot better but for the last like two
days we've been in early having mother
fun we went to Universal we went to a
comedy club we went to someone else I
think that's actually all the time I
can't remember but basically because
I've been feeling a lot but purely I've
just not been vlogging as much and also
the day that we arrived here I came up
from dinner and I washed my face I was
using away from my face and this side
and when I got to this cheek my whole
face was out about here it was social
and it was like an egg on my cheek I
don't know what happened there but it's
gone don't know but basically I find my
body's just been really struggling with
this I'm gonna show you the bite this is
a third by the way I don't know if you
can see that but God you can see back up
with it but basically I got bitten here
but because obviously I've been walking
around my whole ankle is red-hot it's
super swollen and then it's just been
really painful so I've just been feeling
sorry for myself
basically I'm numb well we have that's
my little catch-up for you guys a little
explanation as to why start of the vlog
this week has been pretty quiet let's
hope that everything will be better and
I will be well
