week number 19 yeah 19 I would a face
mask to make myself feel better yes if
you guys saw my skincare video you'll
know that this is my favorite face mask
right now it's the most satisfying peel
your face mat mask ever so I'm gonna do
this and basically today it's like 4
o'clock in afternoon or a date but I
woke up at 9 o'clock and I sat and
watched if I gotta lies I'm finished it
Benj washed it and I finished it and
it's amazing pretty tough to watch some
parts of it but it was really good and
then I've been sitting trying to tidy up
my makeup room for about two hours I'm
just not doing it and then I've had
really bought in admin to do with my
banks and stuff like that and my
accounts which has been pretty stressful
I'm not gonna lie it's not the best
thing to deal with when you're
jet-lagged but I've managed and yep no
I'm gonna put this mask on wait for dry
peel off I'm gonna tidy up my whole
makeup room cuz it is a complete tech it
is so may see all the stuff I've bought
is all over the place when I was away I
left and a bit of a mess when I was
leaving so I need to do that but I
thought I would do a face mask get all
the plain crap at my face and yeah if
you saw my skincare video you'll know
how much I love the silly mask it peels
off in the most satisfying way as she
was my favorite so I thought I would
treat my face treat myself and I know
there's a couple on the website so I
know a few people asked me what it was
and it's this one here
manuka dr. purifying facial peel so
that's what we're doing a lot of you
guys actually I've got too much of
listening a lot of you guys who watched
last week's vlog were super helpful and
it turns out that I may have had
cellulitis
when I was away um which is really gross
but I looked up and apparently mailed
cases can clean up themselves and I do
feel a lot better I slept really well
last night the swelling's gone way down
it's still a lot of
sore but it's like gon die and you can't
even see it anymore so I think I'm
totally fine if I start to feel bad I
promise I'll go to the doctors but I
think I'm fine but thank you so much to
anyone that was concerned um but yeah I
feel I feel totally fine and I how long
do I have to wait for this 15 to 20
minutes until it's dry and then we'll
peel it off and I rolled it on camera
because it is absolutely thrilling
oh boy
this is the first day of our makeup
since I've been home I don't like it
I'm so cold hello
and it's 23 minutes past 4:00
I mean JA here going to the fort I need
to get some stuff
you're good under so you don't know Zeta
I need to get some stuff and I can see
it because this local be out but I am
officially asking my braids mates and
maid of honour to be my bridesmaids the
maid of honor on Friday I have asked
them all to meet me at blazing square
which is my favorite weeks but and guys
because I said oh it's just really
really nice that it's but the staff was
really nice to me Mommy squirrel time so
I've not been in ages but we're going
it's bad for afternoon tea and we
wouldn't do Lola
Eli laugh and we're going to spy for
afternoon tea and then we're going to
Sara most wheat which is like the nice
fat pirate it's just like it really
cause it's got like hot pools and
Jacuzzis and stuff like that so we're
gonna do that
and then what I'm doing is I'm making
them up boxes and I've already got boxes
saying I've already bought them and
they've been delivered and it's
basically got all their names on the top
and then nsaids
and asked some still be my bridesmaids
and stuff so I bought them a while ago
and they got delivered you may have seen
at the beginning of this blog I say I'll
become nice and easily and sure Jack my
new tattoo but he had no idea I was dead
and honestly as a big long story that I
wanted I wouldn't share but there's more
reasons than all the obvious for me
getting this tattoo but I'll show you at
cosa so this is my new tattoo it's Jack
and I love heart and a lot of people all
the people love it and that's great but
there was a fair few comments people
saying that I'm an idiot for doing that
and is a bit crazy but you have to meet
a man yet and I think that's forever so
me as well get a tattoo but if your name
on it because we're going to be late I
mean so I think it's to be better to be
a bit sad that's people had the negative
stuff to say but it ought to say that it
bother me we're going to the floor I
need to get some stuff from the box says
and we need to get some stuff because
we're also me and Jack are having a big
engagement party and I'm really excited
I've always been one of these people
that doesn't really like having parties
for me I've never really had birthday
parties I had one big birthday party
when I was 16 and it was born it was so
much fun so I've not really done it
since then what have it in the house
yeah having it in the house we're just
having the close friends so it's a
pretty intimate party but I think it's
gonna be sex becaus ages ago an event
company got in touch with me and they
basically create bespoke experiences and
they create them and the organisers of
his phone and they got in touch with me
and they said that they would like to
work with me and this is before me and
Jack got engaged and then after we got
engaged we were thinking about having a
party and I just sent them over an email
they're called by me lifestyle
I sent them over an email and I was like
by the way I actually kind of do have an
event that I need to help planning and
leave been amazing so it's gonna be a
big silly party basically and it's all
our house
no come up on the diva
yeah so the phrases that we go to the
spa as the day that the guys from buying
me lifestyle I've been speaking to
Yasmin mostly and they're coming up on
Friday morning to start setting up stuff
in the house and me and all the girls
are going to the spa and then me and
Jack I've actually got a thing to do on
Friday night where there's an audience
with Conor McGregor and we would invite
it along to that and obviously mean Jack
went all the way to Vegas to see the
fete so it was amazing so we're really
excited for that to come so yeah it's
kind of a busy week I feel really weird
I've sat in my makeup and about two days
trying to get it all sorted out I ended
up going through every single drawer
cleaning it out on my makeup which is
just a stupid idea because I've been
sitting here forever doing it I've
watched three Christmas movies like back
watch Love Actually so I had him in
Sally and that but honey when Sally is
not a Christmas movie but it is it is a
bit it's Christmas Eve so it makes me
feel like Christmas and then the holiday
there are the movies that I've watched
today you know yeah everyone's gonna get
mad at me saying Jamie you should be
making Halloween tutorials not watching
Christmas it is thought I needed some
time today's Santa Claus makeup for
Halloween
I can't cheeks I look like that before
the money no we're home and we're doing
stuff you're gonna see more of me
talking this week so there's that I
think that's gonna be create a little
funny how when I'm not in the other
vlogs thank you Ken oh yeah Jack you
you're a star thank you there is no
content you just so handsome did to eat
being ordered why Natalie Lunchables
cause I like to feel like I'm on it
isn't yeah but I used to get in on my
pack lunch when I was at school I was at
Primary School it's a taste of nostalgia
I'm far too cool to be doing this I
can't believe it I can't believe her
cool there is no metal this is some
like an ass come on you can't see if
come we didn't work any of it and you
sunshade and you put a key light and
that but surely that would burn up here
and then the Rope we catch on fire
few things can get quick hot you want to
get the fast and furious talk for
d'Ã¡gua get off a table I speak ill for
a stir
to Dan to get a damn I listen to people

really bothers me as my Chen so I got a
lot of comments about that but basically
I know how to be really good TLC and
make it look like I have a jawline but
unfortunately I don't really have a
jawline and there's something in America
right now that I know a lot of people
have had you may not openly talk about
it but I know that they've had and it's
kybella and basically it's a thing that
dissolves the fat under your chin and I
can guarantee you that the minute it
hits here in the UK I am going to be the
person to try it out and show you the
before and after results because it'll
actually make me so much happier if I
didn't have a big chubby face so I'm
numbing my lips I'm getting a tiny
little bit put and this inner here and

in my body and get my botox done and
