sure but you put it because we've got
two bedrooms upstairs and technically
two bedrooms down the stairs one of
which is my office
schedule and the other one was our
bedroom but our bedroom is probably the
room in the house that needs the most
work done so I don't really like it I
don't like spending time in there the
will the wallpaper is crazy and the
carpet start and which I love but it
gives me a headache
and it's quite small room because
there's fitted wardrobes that again we
don't like so we want to get rid of them
by bed got delivered and who were like
yeah just put it in our bedroom and then
the guy was kinda half building it and
was there not the door and was like
hello I won't be able to build your bed
today it's not come with all the parts
so our bedroom is now lettered with wood
everywhere because it can't build it so
we're going to sleep in the living room

oh my god

most of all update came a few things of
happened since we last all basically
first things first the camera broke and
it was not my fault
again but it was my whole act with
Taylor and when I got home from
Coachella it was working again so this
it broken Coachella the land is all
messed up then it start working again
for a little while and that's what we
filmed our full blog last week with but
then picked out or Jack picked up and
you're just a judgment works we had to
get a new camera so I want to a
different camera because I have come to
the conclusion that the sorting II 5/100
it's fuzzy I'm not clumsy
it is flimsy so I've got different
camera this is the canon g7x mark ii i
will link it down below for anyone that
needs a good camera because it is
fantastic so I'm filming on a new camera
but also in the conservatory the sound
sounds a bit mental very equally should
have thought with that but an RFI my new
friend Daniel at sky has managed to
finally Beck so basically everyone else
had talked to me thus far had been
really not helpful whatsoever in
downhill it just so happened to be a
subscriber has managed to sort
everything out so we should have it on

little gem and the conservatory so he
went and got his weights that you saw in
Belden and then I just got yoga mat
we're doing some work in a so Jack's got
sweets he's been doing there I did my
yoga and then I also used some of Jack's
weights as well and I actually feel like
secret conservatory so warm or both your
sway and so I feel like it's working all
right
so the plan is don't hold me to this but
the plan is to do it just every morning
home I wake up jack kicks door go I have
a morning coffee
I'm immediately conservatory and even
just like a half hour 45 minute workout
and I think if I do that every morning
I'll get used to it I'll be more
productive during the day and hopefully
I'll start to to look bear fires going

really try actually no I've said it in
the vlog you guys can tweet me be like
have you done you to exercise today have
you done it today we'll see
awesome I know I'm so hot in there and
that's another thing the house is pretty
cool the conservatory is always would
you see like 10 degrees hotter and relax
at the greenhouse is so hot in there and
so it's almost like going like back from
yoga or something like I like hot yoga
watch this space I'm gonna be buff oh
look at that glow god damn I just made a
Instagram video for Rimmel they've got
some new products coming out so I made a
video for them and I'm actually going to
sit and edit now because then I need to
like get get done man look at this
makeup room it's so messy so there's a
computer there obviously that Jack's
IDEO is quite clean and then you get to
this literally still old boxes I've got
my little setup here from a makeup
Easter but then this is kind of what I'm
working off off and it's too small it's
too small to fit anything so I'm really
gonna have to sort of the jet let's see
your fingers place your fingers why
should that be artists or jack punch the
pole and painless hashtags born no no no
I feel bad I just made a delicious
sandwich
it looks again like a bull the weight
but it's not so we've got some scrambled
egg with fried onion and there some
spinach and a pepper please someone
please tell me this is healthy because I
just do not know what I'm doing
I'm so already so I just might got my
nails done and I forgot to tape my
 camera but look they're sparkly
they're just like my nails they match my
fingernails and then JAXA boot for a
couple jokes with his parents and I came
home and with the dog he's been crazy
Xena's dead right now but he's just
having some fun and then oh I actually
just got a text off a guy who's coming
to potentially daiquiri a little bit in
here because there's a lot of wallpaper
and he's taking off and there's a lot of
Pete and he's done to just refresh it a
little bit it won't be the way that
we're going to keep hit probably but
it's something I was like a blank canvas
right so we'll be able to see what we
actually want to get done now which will
be good so I'm really happy it's coming
now because there was a chance that we
weren't going to be able again until
after we were back from traveling and
that would be in like three weeks time
which means everything would be like
three weeks later and I really want to
get the ball rolling earnest when it's
gas with this house when I get stuff
done Oh is she so healthy doe there is
she so healthy good morning I just made
the mistake of watching a wee bit of my
border border vlog I want to go back how
do you feeling today Jack he doing
I need pack and I need to get ready and
I'm going to my friend Cadiz it's her
boyfriend's birthday and I having a
barbecue and it was actually not meant
to be here I was made to be going
already but I'm not some winner go down
for the barbecue Jack's gonna give me a
left own so I can have some beers I've
been doing some research on stuff from
my Beauty room for the studio which is
going well and make all my deck in here
got in touch and he's happy to take on
the project very exciting so go go go
hashtags born
Jax went to Marks and Spencers
got some foods
putting as much in bother the cheesie's
from Jamie Oliver cheeseball baby kite
and shock your table yeah
I've done my makeup alone getting packed
so I'm probably trying to pack my makeup
basically for going away and I wanted to
show you guys this thing it's like one
of those shower things you hang it up
I think people must usually use it for
like toiletries and stuff at that but as
the perfect thing from a makeup so the
bottom I keep all my food stuffs I've
got my foundations bronzers highlight
ice blush all that stuff pirate doors
and stuff I got and then this one is
basically eyes brows and lips and in
this one here it's a new pool that
doesn't usually happen and then this one
up here is going to be all my brushes
lip balm eyelash glue tweezers sharpener
all that stuff and then you basically
just roll it up and it's like this and
then you've got an elastic little
elastic band so you can put that through
I'll leave the link down below because I
think this is the best thing for
traveling that I've ever found
I got giving it at Coachella next give
us a couple of little things so yeah I
just think look and then that's how it
is and cause it's soft you can leave it
you can even like I Liat flat in my
suitcase when I was running in a room
and it actually really nice and flat so
there's my new favorite thing
hashtag knocks born hashtag just being
helpful another thing I was going to
mention as I've really managed to swim
lane on my makeup brushes so this is all
the makeup brushes I use pretty much
every day they need cleans I'm going to
do that tonight but if you guys want a
quick video on my current favorite
brushes let me know because these are
literally all amusing and it's like it's
not that many so when I'm traveling I
just put all these and my little makeup
bag and it's totally enough and if you
wondering this is just a mug I got from
TK Maxx
it was about three pounds 99 but it was
cute and it goes with my plans nice
actually need to simmer here Oh
haha and yeah I'm just waiting literally
black jeans from Levi's and there's
Kalia t-shirt that's really old and pull
the knees thrown out got holes in it but
it's made to have holes in it one of
those ones you know that's highlight by
the way sleek the Solstice palette super
cheap but my god
Placido cube
everything's great he was super helpful
and is basically give us a good idea of
what things to do and what order I'm
real hoping to get everything kind of
done in August that cool August yeah

the same time after via bike from Miami

positive sorted I thought you're gonna
say get my birthday woman done my haha

other guesses didn't prepare for the
fact that this is gonna be about a sing
