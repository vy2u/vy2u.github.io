my stop is me bandana these my friends
are tantrum donors sugar oh I've been
eating these messages I'm gonna make
their similar I might be in a bikini we
left her log last week I was coming home
from the corner dragon fight basically
what happened for the next three days
was party party party great guy don't
like we had to clean basically I cannot
begin to tell you how grateful we are to
Yasmin and bail from by me lifestyle so
I told you guys last week basically we
had the silliest bag party we just had
the best day ever
the hosts sold it to me and we had a
doughnut wall from on crew we had
doughnuts from traffic stream as well
Yasmin was like you really like doing
this don't you okay probably myself yes
when was he wrote a sore and gazebo fro
excited we had a hot tub we had catering
so we have fits which is amazing it went
through the bail we had bar guards let
with salmon Bindu Bellinis which was my
favorite and we had chicken and Lord is
their entree also had chocolate
strawberries I've got a bit 7 left and
I'm waiting for mom dad to get here so I
can show them we had a bar as well which
was actually probably
jay-z's thing because everyone obviously
use the bar till it was dry
and on the day of the party the guys are
here from 8:00 in the morning until 4:00
in the mornin it was so good but what
we're gonna do is figure out this to the
edge and hopefully we're gonna have
something really really fun to show you
guys or the party
I mean Jack have peasants I honestly did
not know do you get presents when you
get engaged Riviera friends were just
really create graduation so new
engagement we wear she pulls the last
time of beautiful memories to give her
love Jonathan Jonathan where's the
console Jonathan Gemma or the card maybe
no that's John's Regan no it's not you
know John's rain is horrific
is that nice his name Amy and Jackie
just wait to watch movie was a cold
Godric's Godric Jared Gerald game bear
Jack's having a Burger King I just had
baby facial so my skin's wouldn't super
shy in it poke my face obviously always
put my face we're gonna watch movie and
I need to get packed I'm off to
Marrakesh tomorrow with wire sale I'm
really really excited but I'm tired yeah
so we're gonna watch this movie and I'm
gonna write a list of what I need to
pack so I can watch you just get out
after we've watched the film
hello
um and Marrakesh I made at the hotel
room is absolutely gorgeous I will show
you guys that tomorrow unfortunately I
lost my suitcase which is fine it's just
a bit annoying but only here for two
nights and I usually say I don't know
you know what it's like I think I'll
actually I don't have any of my stuff so
I still know how I'm doing basically
what happened was I got to Gatwick
Airport before a vanilla said so I
checked in really early and then I think
they just must have forgot to arrive on
the plane or something but basically
they're gonna try and get it out to me
tomorrow morning maybe but it's probably
gonna be tomorrow night and then we
leave literally the next day so it's
really unfortunate I'm here if I fail
the team have been swarming saying I got
to my room there's a little bottle of
champagne which I am drinking I'll wake
up tomorrow I feel much better I think
I'm just a bit got it just now but I'll
show you guys the room tomorrow morning
we are just whipped head down I'm just a
bit of head down for dinner Robin for
dinner everyone's getting all dressed up
I am reading my plane outfit I think the
thing that's upsetting me the most is
but basically the guy it was minute
process my missing suitcase just kept on
laughing at me and it was the most
frustrating thing because I wasn't upset
I'm just like cool so it kisses lost
don't worry really these things happen
in my mind I probably could have got
quite upset because it's definitely if
you're on hold if you can just go get
some stuff but I'm here for literally
two days I was so excited but getting
photos I'm here for the blind trip so
it's gonna be really I feel I feel
buyers because I'm not really gonna be
able to get as much content and stuff
like hopefully I'll get it back tomorrow
morning this is there's terrible things
happening in the world this is
definitely not one of them totally fine
and it's just a bit of a funny feeling
not and they don't know where my stuff
is they don't know if it's in Garret
work or Marrakech or a different Airport
maybe it's on the wrong plane so if the
accident is saying that our different
country I won't get my stuff at all I
will with desire to model and get
something to the air it's gonna be it to
literally frame
hello I'm in a vision he was Nika box
she's right there and image is taking
some synapses though this morning you
saw we went to the wire sale Gardens
which is beautiful and it was super busy
so quite a lot of the governor's were
struggling to get Falls but people were
get and they snapped by the end of it
right now
case update there's not really an update
a they don't know who else we got told
that directories currently help because
they don't know who that is or if it's
not an au key report they can't do much
about that it's been it's been really
weird so some of the guys from my cell
are actually going to pick me up some
underwear and hopefully some form of
someone costume because we're going to
be doing a pill party frankly I'm so
good because we're only here for
literally like two nights it's a really
really quick trip I thought I was maybe
gonna get my case this morning and it's
not happened and they still don't know
where Marquis says which means it's
probably not gonna be in the flight
because it's like the Bret series fight
that we got here yesterday is in Taurus
time so unless they find it and put on
that flight I won't forget that tonight
either
which means if I get it tomorrow morning
then great I'll I'll put some clothes on
and try and get some pictures and do my
makeup and stuff but I think that
there's a good chance that I'm not gonna
get it I told on this trip so it's
tricky gotten because I just can't do
anything I can't get any pictures kind
of a haircut like it phones its own full
potato cake but see when it's your job
and it's like your stuff it's like it's
like really I don't know those who
violated but it's like like my idol mer
stuff I was it's just really weird
really weird feeling positive
ceci lent me a jumpsuit which is just
come fair which I've probably gonna wear
for the next couple days
oh my god the guys in the bags your
insider and hit him and it came back and
I've got something sick psycho it's
breaking my heart I was sitting here we
played told many quotes on
look at them photos

the back situation don't know who dies
there we're hoping there's gonna be this
late oh the shared universe fire sale
units from Glasgow so yeah hopefully I
make it home tonight and my bag might be
there which would be so great I I think
this was a taste I'm actually ugly I
think it's a taste for me to appreciate
my belongings because I do appreciate
them and I need them and I will never
take you for granted ever again going
into the desert we're gonna race camels
