excited to do that and then at two
o'clock
I am Brickton at the bill forum for e
Hydra facial which I'm very excited for
really excited I've not had a facials
and CEO Lee and we're gone
we'd gone to the chaplain we're gonna
get man I'm in the bill form and say I'm
gay and hide official high the tight
hydro tight combination of hydro facial
and indie box or radiofrequency amazing
video if she can see what she's gonna
tighten me out right yeah it's good
whoo so we're gonna do that see how long
how long does it take for those today
this is mama to shell she sought me out
and over and a half amazing
and we're going to endeavor and yell you
battle video for you and say hey I'm
gonna shuffle up the bed and now this is
what's gonna help tighten up my Titan
skin double chin it makes collagen ESA's
happened which is the stimulation of
collagen
look oh my god I actually look like at
all I look like I'm tall with s but I'm
gonna do that
so once the temperature I'm just going
to maintain it there for a few minutes
and then we're going to switch to the
second electrode as well without for a
few minutes okay girl and then do that
in the other side as well what's a
second electorate of life it just works
a wee bit deeper than the skin okay so
this one's more so professional works on
the skin tightening and then I'm going
to source a wee bit deeper to sort of
stimulate your muscles as well to a
41-point
to
it's looks like your insurer you'll have
me it's another thing I'm gonna do
that's kind you can tell me if I'm
getting it wrong right right so the
first thing we did with the claims yep
we cleanse my face and then we did the
Hydra facial part which is the first
part you blast the active ingredients
into my skin to cleanse your skin
cleanse the skin and - it kind of breaks
up any dirt and any blocked pores right
and you suck all out and then we did a
glycolic acid peel which is not too
strong not looking to make me look like
a scaly lizards or anything and then let
that let the skin lift out on the skin
and then we blasted for the extractions
which is the tiny little chip which is
literally like all my all my stuff is
smooth right now and then we took that
off and then we put the peptides and
hyaluronic acid and then we dead-end a
bar and D bar which is basically for a
degree heat and you rub it and rub it
and rub it in and then what it does is
it produces collagen so heats up your
skin
yeah you're 40 degrees above that label
to stimulate your collagen production
okay so some of the it's a collagen
production and then it's gonna tight and
it's gonna help me tight in but I mean
currently I've just made a decision and
I'm gonna do this once a week for six
weeks I'm going to show you the before
and after because it does actually give
you a long-term results and it gives you
more of a defined jaw which I'm sure you
guys know right now twat I'm Gordon for
sure do you think I look tighter I'm
gonna go home and have a keel pallet and
then go to through my third PT session
of the week changed women know what I'm
but it's a gym I just go into the night

new stuff new play against fun nice I
