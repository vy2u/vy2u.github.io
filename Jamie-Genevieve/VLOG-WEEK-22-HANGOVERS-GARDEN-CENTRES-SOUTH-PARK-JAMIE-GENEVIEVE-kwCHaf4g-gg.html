sweaty man this is a new toy you sure

absolute idea I missed all my
appointments today
I completely slipped through in my
dentist appointment and my knee is
killing me and i can't go to any toner
so I've had to cancel everything
what we're going to cinema to see
snowman which I would say is the film
that we've got most excited for this
whole year and it has really bad reviews
the last time review we got reviews like
that it was for alien and we both like
that and I would see like Michael
Fassbender yeah but I was actually gonna
say I liked psychological fillers that
as I said closure consider all the
movies that is it you know so we're
going a PK as thanks me Jack could be
spent making an effort to do more date
night here's a romantic with me good
night mmm
that film was rubbish I don't use this
it out I'll sit and watch anything yeah
you know actually I'm easily pleased
you're good at a bad song yeah I get
lost the native movie I'll enjoy it blah
blah blah then it was awful
and the advert made it look so good
that's the point as well because I've
been moving forward to have sex - I know
what me and Jack wolf got we both told
each other in the chiller we got really
excited about it we've watched it we
were just buzzing about let's be honest
then it's just it was corrupt how can
you get out psychological thriller along
with a killer in it you know that's my
favorite enjoyment knows my physical
psychological fillers
I mean Jack's ultimate fear and that was
passion or do you talk messy permanently
I just actually that whole film thinking
about how much I just want to go home
and South Park these we start someone
just Gideon that for Santi yeah just
weekly fee starches that almost get in

a boat tense akin to that whole film and

earlier I'm gonna try and get it all in
my drawers and sort everything out and
yeah that's what I'm doing today we are
gonna insert a little clip right here of
our engagement party so everyone's been
asking the written engagement party the
truth is we've had footage but it's
taking so long to get it all collated
and to get it it's pretty much because
we've just been so busy I've had a law
sponsored work went out this week and
it's just the way that the diary failed
because from ages I wasn't doing
anything and I was just doing my usual
videos and then it just so happens that
this huge little campaign plus a few
other campaigns have been going on at
the same time
I personally don't love it when that
happens but it's my job so that's fine I
do I do always get the odds come in a
bit meeting too much sponsored work
honestly it's just the way it went this
week so I'm not I've just been kinda
and over the so tomorrow it's Monday and
it's back to work so I'm gonna be
filming loads of tutorial you've got
loads of fun ideas so I'm going to be
doing that again but we're gonna insert
a little clip just here of our
engagement party it was so much fun and
obviously like I said earlier are a few
vlogs ago we had a lot of help we pretty
much did not organize anything by me
lace tail organized everything so what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna put the
content up and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to list everyone that helped
out down below so see if you're from
Glasgow then all these companies are
guys called base like most of them are
binding lace tails know they're based in
London but they helped me out and I was
also up in Glasgow so I'm gonna put the
footage in or Jack gonna put the fish in
I hope you like it
