sounds so stupid but it's actually the
most fun of her and then obviously I've
got bubbles and then I went to Marks and
Spencers and just got tons of junk foods
to look trusts and debt biscuits and
cheese chocolate cupcakes my favorite my
favorite thing ever me and Jack have had
some soup the house is looking great
it's all tidy and clean isn't it I
finally cleaned my makeup your profile
is real thank goodness I'll show you
what it looks like what it's made to
look like so there's my little Selman
station that's where I set and film
there's my little backdrop I put my
YouTube award thing up there this is my
skincare trolley so this is what me and
the girls will be using today so it's
got all my skincare unit all my haircare
down the bottom but this top drawer is
like my favorite thing ever I've got all
my little shelves neat and up just got
all my kinda nice things all my bags and
stuff like that
got my little desk with my computer this
is just my little wire connect grid
thing that I got from Urban Outfitters
and it's just got some things on it from
events and just fun memories you know I
look at it sometimes and I'm just late
well I'm so lucky and then here is my
real of claws theracane I fans here like
there's my engagement party dress
there's the one of the dresses I got
when I was in Morocco and then also some
work stuff so if ever gets in clothes or
whatever and I want to post them then
I'll leave them there and then here it's
just that's honestly just junk it's all
just junk I really actually don't like
this unit
I told but when I was moving in these
two actually these three things that's
real this unit and the Shelf are all
really really
sheep from Ikea so they just kind of
helped me sort everything and then
obviously my makeup storage I have that
drawn in that dish but I really don't
use it because mice Cheers in the way
but I've got the two Alex drawers either
Said's I've actually gone through all my
makeup and all my makeups just in these
two Alex drawers now which is crazy
but hopefully when I get my room done up
I'll get more storage so I can start you
know keeping everything and then this is
mostly actually skincare oh my god
that's crazy yeah this is old skincare
and travel stuff and hair care and stuff
like that
Annetta smell tour of my makeup room if
anyone follows Green sweats her got a
little laundry bucket I don't thing let
me know if you want to see my makeup
collection as it stands because I've
done a real declutter I was so sick of
how much stuff I had and I wasn't using
and it was just going to waste when
someone else could have it and they
probably appreciate it a lot more than
me I've just got so much stuff so I've
gone through loads of stuff I'm sure
it'll be a go away something soon but
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get ready for
the ladies who come is big so currently
Monday morning and we had so much fun
yesterday me no medals the went home at
like 11 o'clock oh my god gee it looks
like the rebranded because this looks a
lot nicer than the old packaging Wow
let's start at the beginning look at all
these liquid lipstick this weird
Nate master 7 piece brush collection I
dare to create 39 in a palette I must
say this is really pretty nice more fur
usually you stepped up a tablecloth
let's go Christmas see pattern order for
Christmas it's just it's a bit more fun
I was gonna get just a plain red when I
really like this wood so I go uh
tablecloth this is all some heat your
name by the way
I got a sequined
runner so it looks like this and then
you do that and it's gold so I thought
that was really nice I think I'm a
cleared maker all gold but I think what
would be really cute is when the tables
are set I've got this running down'n
medal when you've got candles on it it
will bless them really nicely that's why
I'm going to stuff her right in there
oh my shop encoded once okay what else
it again oh I like this for the bathroom
I think I'll get more of these but only
got one Supreme Being just two types of
sides this is a colour old bag that's
what that would be great no need to keep
so it's not so messy
and yeah this is like a it's like a
chopping board but I'm gonna have it in
the middle of the table with some
candles and stuff on it and it's nice
because it's got the bark at the sides
which walls where jackal is actually
good
are you okay kit these posters I see a
little coasters with the bar from the
site as well which I thought would be
nice for the dinner table I got to say I
don't know how many people were gonna
have be having all this stuff super like
super package ah
are you kidding me on that is flippin
tiny after this is gonna be huge but
it's got a little wooden top and I
thought I could have put I don't know
something nice in there that's tiny okay
that's a joke great feel Christmas
napkins gold on them napkin rings so
these are really cute little gold napkin
rings that look great oh my god all my
stuff together as we can
I'm using actually sweet look it's like
a cinnamon can tell but it's an
appropriate glass jar with a cork top
smells good not not strong enough why
our magazine rack which I thought would
be really sweet for pretty much anywhere
probably my office to be honest though
because I sort of got all my notepads
and stuff so yeah that's what we got
from eh name hey rats a quark me and
