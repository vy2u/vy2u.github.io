Hey so I spoke to you guys in ages this
is stuck again not to you guys new Jose
yesterday me and Jack got back home from
the Dakota hotel after at the BAFTAs
honestly we were both feeling pretty bad
yesterday I just basically got packed
because I am back in London again this
week my Eaton's been pretty bad honestly
but I'm back on my health kick so I am
at the Savoy Hotel I don't know if you
guys will remember but I was down here
for the Charlotte Tilbury oven and I
bloody love this hotel it's one of the
oldest hotels in London I absolutely
love the bathroom you know me my
bathroom selfies this is one and I also
love that they use reliable products
because this is the pair of humor where
I wear santel 33 and they've got the
little Apple stuff in the bathroom which
I really like was a big rule top bar a
nice shower in there with more reliable
stuff and then out here it's super
bougie like it's proper a fancy-pants
love the floor the room has gorged nice
big beds it's like a really spacious
there's a lot of space in this hotel
which I really like and then the view is
crazy because it's right on the water so
I'm bloody thrilled got a little view
you can see the London Eye so nice of
you
so the reason I'm in London as I've got
a few events this week so I'm here it's
Tuesday just now it's choose the like
lunchtime and I am on my way almost I've
got about half an hour 40 minutes and
I'm going for lunch with Gigi Hadid I'm
so excited I think she is so gorgeous
but Gigi Hadid and Maybelline have just
brought a collaboration so she is coming
over which is over in London so we're
going to go for a lunch and then I'm
coming back to the table to get ready
and then tonight there's a big event so
lunch is a little bit more intimate
there's not that many people going and
then tonight there's a big event there's
tons of people going I think there's
quite a few folks from like TV and stuff
like that which is really cool so yeah
I'm really excited so we're doing that I
say we me I mean some friends down here
and you guys know Amy's makeup box she
is good friend of mine she's iron swords
Rachel Lily
Cece Clark there's
all the youtubers down and about London
this week because there's just tons
going on so today we're doing the
Maybelline event then tomorrow I've got
a day full of meetings with my manager
which I'm really excited if I'm getting
to hang out with the founder of coke
beauty and obviously you guys know that
I absolutely love coke beauty it's like
my guilty pleasure I spend all morning
I'm meeting nurse Jamie I think for a
facial I'm gonna go and check out the
JCM store and then on Thursday I am
moving hotel I'm moving from the Savoy
over to the Mondrian Mondrian monitoring
on its own house I'm moving over to the
Mondrian for an event with sleek so I've
actually never worked with sleep before
so it was really cool to get in but yeah
it's going to that event on Thursday
night staying over Thursday night and
then I am home on Friday so that's a
whole week we're gonna be cut a bit
London together area who works at the
Savoy just popped up and dropped off
some cupcakes and some peers and I love
the little notes to say welcome back
which is really really sweet so thank
you so so much and yeah I'm definitely
gonna have to have at least one of these
cakes at IP board at IP
I'm back in the hotel room I need to get
changed for tonight I find it really
funny because I'm gonna be a double
datum tonight and I don't Kerr I look
like her nineties daydream in this
outfit
I really like I love Doubleday and I'm
one of my favorite photos of me and my
dad ever was when I was maybe about
three years old four years old so my dad
must have been like young he was maybe
like 22 or something
he's ruined Doubleday time and I just
think it's the coolest thing ever summer
and Doubleday and I'm tonight and I just
got back we got guests Ed's these really
cute self cameras which I'm gonna wear
tonight her adorable proper jammies
they say Maybelline and gh4 Gigi Hadid
we also got all the makeup so I'm pretty
buzzed then because I just tried a toe
and really in place I think it's a shame
I think these events are brilliant but
they're also brilliant so you can learn
a bit about what what was made and why
they made that and how it's made to be
used and stuff because I I'm really
excited I'm going to create a makeup
using all this stuff because obviously a
Maybelline drugstore as well so it's a
wee bit cheaper the jetsetter palette
which is a burger palace they're equid
which is quite a lot for from Maybelline
but I tried the highlight eye which is
what you'll have seen and it's really
gorgeous and so was the bronzer so I'm
gonna try all this stuff when I get home
but yeah that event was really nice it
was really intimate there was maybe
about 30 or 35 people there was only a
handful of influencers but there was a
lot of press there and I find that so
sad but press don't really like
influencers because if you think about
it the way that these things just
happened was the magazines and editors
and stuff like that we get to go and try
and make up and go on trips and like
player shops have been a thing forever
so all these people from magazines used
to come play strips and then just the
way media's go and obviously you get
influencers the whole idea is it's a
person just like you that's telling you
about makeup and stuff like that so it's
originally it was more honest and really
it can add cuts out the middleman
because you don't have to go and buy a
magazine you can just go online and
watch a video and then find out what you
need to know so I think it's a reason
for influencers can do when you use your
platform honestly it's the best thing
ever but basically because we've come
along and we get to go on these trips we
get paid by brands
exactly what the magazines used to do
there's not as much work for magazines
anymore
loads of magazines have gone under loads
of magazines have online and and prent
have ended up having a team together and
under one house and run their magazines
like that so basically they just have no
time and I overheard this woman I don't
know where she worked I don't know who
she was but she went over and she was
like making sure the place don't have to
sit next to the influencers and stuff
and I'm like if you found any of us
carrying on like that we wouldn't have
jobs like oh it's just it's so easy to
be nice but these people seem to get
away with not being nice I have had
really nice experiences with place
before as well we use go up time and say
hi I'm Jamie I do this and it ends up
getting out and getting on with most
people but some of them just don't even
give you a chance they don't care of
what you've got to say or who you are
they just know that you're an influencer
and they immediately don't like yes or
honestly that's one day later then the
center state that really upsets me
because I just don't think that we
deserve it apart from that though it was
so nice I finally got to meet some of
the PR guy knows Maybelline so lovely
really really nice so it was really cool
I've not really done much work with
Mabel even before so it was really nice
to be invited down today and it was
great and now I'm gonna get changed
because tonight is a bigger event like I
said earlier so I'm gonna get changed
top up my makeup I don't really know
what to do I don't know maybe bit my
eyes directed or something but we will
see still not eating the cakes and being
a good girl my car home from their event
is boot for a 10 o'clock and I'm getting
it and I'm not gonna drink and I'm gonna
go to the gym when I get back for a
little 45 minutes and then get a good
night's sleep for meetings tomorrow
they all know I just ripped my jeans did
I know great we're good and honest with
you guys my not drinking thing didn't
work
I had approximately four drinks
and I feel fight buzz site buds of these
shoes by the way were them all night so
instead of going to the gym I'm gonna
order room service I'm starvin and I'm
gonna have an early night I'm gonna
drink a liter of water and I'll be fine
but I had the most fun tonight all the
girls were saying that they were to go
out and I was like no I'm gonna go home
it's half past 10:00 totally reasonable
very proud of myself and I know Jack's
headed in this and I know he's gonna be
proud to be but he's also good to see
Jamie you said you weren't gonna drink
tonight and you did ah these things
happen
it's the first time I met enabling
kiddos and they are so much fun my fear
killing me oh my god is a blessed day
so yeah we do have them Sara face and
then go to sleep and wake up early
enough to go to the gym tomorrow I swear
hello I never went to the gym I'm gonna
go tonight because today it's half past
9:00 in the morning so I'm ready I got
up at 8 o'clock and I was so tired I'm
not hungover though I drank a liter of
water and had a sandwich before I went
to bed
psych drapes were a really good sleep
out today and then I just I woke up at 7

to go to the gym and I was like no I'm
too tired

really excited I'm really excited I'm
meeting with some fun people that I've
not made with you

last night was honestly the most fun
I've got a sore neck from fluffing my
hair around so I'm not I'm adorable
anymore because I think my makeup off
but I am at Cole Bowie and do you
recognize this
I remember it tattoos what did she use
those it's it's amazed and she couldn't
really understand why but it's one of
those things that I've been want to try
forever but I am anything and Irish to
me and she's going to touch my face
she's gonna give me a triangle style
facial we're using the ruler I think I'm
certain with literally two of my
favorite women legs who is the core
founder of coffee tea and an Emma who
manages basically I'm gonna look tight
and my face is gonna be all lifted
oh is this one of the ones that vibrates
that's why not see good it's good enough
for her dad it's good enough for me so
I'm here at with nurse Giri yeah my
name's Jamie as well I love it my
channel and it's port if the treatment
we're doing today which is all that
triangle so this is like for my
celebrity cult favorites and we read it
to Kowski Olivia culpo so now we're
doing it on to you my dear I love that
there's the heat then you can go to
which I'll go through and go to the
cooling I'm going to do because I want
to see maximum hair work this end and
you're so young but someone like my age
you're really gonna see a visible
difference on this jawline kind of carve
this out the firmness and it's just a
maximum absorption of your product
so in and around here too just for like
sushi any salty foods the night before
and I've only done this for just like
less than a minute and you can already
see that this brow is slightly higher so
this part on my Jo right yeah that's way
you can do it either way
see I repeat enter right in you know you
do a little
pressure feels great it's like a face
mask badge isn't it mm-hmm and then I'm
gonna do this smile everyone just just
soften this hold a little bit and also
helps with like little fine lines on the
web it's sort of yeah back in the hotel
