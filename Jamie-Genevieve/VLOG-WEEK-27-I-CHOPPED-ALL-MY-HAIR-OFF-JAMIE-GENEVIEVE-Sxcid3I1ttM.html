which emerge what is summer
not faster at home don't know what's
going on today mean it's just Monday oh
I'm so tired I was meant to film today
and I just cannot do it I'm literally
stealing at my camera and I was can't
bring myself to do it so I'm calling to
do right off it's already full o'clock
mum dad went over for a bet they had
some lunch he got some Blaine stood
upstairs which did not fit they did not
fit properly they're like they thought
they were gonna be made of material
they're made of plastic so just like a
bit shaky and we are you so tired and I
got Nooh here this is my new here a
blonde a blonde woman but I've just got
8 my face just now but I actually love
my new favorite thing to do with my hair
it's just a law down poorni oh yes all
the time it's easy it's ate my face
great I'm very happy that's short
hearing this kind of style as a trend
these in the post today kills creme de
corte body smoothing oil to form body
cleanser and nourishing dry pour the oil
and it smells absolutely unbelievable so
these are making me feel Christmassy I
think that's what it is I just want a
good Christmas I just want to stay in my
house and watch movies and have a bath
that's all good but today is Monday so
it's PTT PT and for hours
so Jack oh so you know got the the male
blonde here I'm glad it would be really
embarrassing if there she hadn't done it
and seemed at me tomorrow morning drop
was booked in at this because he's
getting his little as little men chopped
off and Davis see it about it but a good
thing we need to do it to be safe they
doesn't make puppies to make sure as
well it doesn't get to secular can't say
because dogs can get that so that's
happening tomorrow morning really early
we need to be at the vet for a came past
eight in the morning
so tomorrow it's gonna be a really
productive day and I know that if I get
my makeup I'm sorry dope first then I
can be productive tomorrow I don't have
to worry about it
I think when I am sitting in a maze at
me to de-stress though it makes me like
not happy I think that's the case of
most people but this is a maze and also
my clothes
stairs again at Emmaus I just don't know
how it happens I think it's because I
don't have a good place for either of
those things to go like my wardrobe
situation upstairs is rubbish and then
my storage down here is absolutely
obvious as well that is my complaint of
the date you know what that's not that
bad
me and Jack are gonna have some soup if
you watch a bit of a TV show
clean up this makeup area get change go
to the gym come home sleep wake up
tomorrow globe with the very productive
day I'm gonna film tour videos got a
bunch emails to reply to and by tomorrow
night we're gonna be on top everything
that's gonna be amazing
we're going to PT Jabba had his
operation in Spain mom dad I'm gonna
come pick them up and that's what's
happening no no because the cameras
gonna die hope you go India can you just
skip those toys right up Oh Sonia why is
that what's that what's that
that comes in handy there huh look you
can't take awful it's like a shoot Oh
again how many how many channels does it
give you
Hey so my camera kept on dying today
which is a shame because I've not really
been able to update you but remember I
said yesterday I was gonna have a
productive day well me and Jack go up at
10 past 7:00 and we took Draghi boy to
the vets because he had the old snip
snip and he just looks it looks pretty
miserable to be honest versus this is
what we're dealing with how sad is that
a little winded soldier the vet said it
was back to normal
totally healed actually seven to ten
days were holding hope that it'll be a
bit better tomorrow I think it's still
got anaesthetic in the system right now
film two videos jack edited them I went
to PT today I mean caraway and it was
really good
and now I'm just finishing up these
edits send them over one of them
sponsored got sent over to get approved
the other one is not just a makeup
tutorial on this look in fact really
really basic I would it last week
thought some of you guys asked for a
tutorial so by the time this video goes
up that tutorial will definitely be live
so you can go and check that out if you
want and apart from that new Jack are

multiple personalities it's very
interesting

am going in to do to see Caroline who
also does injectables but we're doing a
treatment on my neck so as you saw a few
blocks ago you'll have seen that the
thing that bothers me most about Matt
myself is my chubby face your community

potato

face or unless you had a heart-shaped
potato talk then okay okay fair enough
and I'm gonna get this treatment under
my name and basically as he saw the vlog

it's basically extreme heat which makes
collagen work better or start working
