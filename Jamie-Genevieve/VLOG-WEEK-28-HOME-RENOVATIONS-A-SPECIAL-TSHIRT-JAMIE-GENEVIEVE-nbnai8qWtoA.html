itself out who the booty your friend a
shimmer in my skin but I still will use
it from knowing again because they dude
fuzzy like you week number 28 I need to
wash my hair I need to film
Jax going to get his like a tattoo today
I am NOT envious Awards over he's got
all the color to get done and his and
his lake his leg sleeve his big sock I'm
watching fab retirees obviously I'm on
season 3 it was one it's great I think I
have first my Christmas shopping but I
can't even talk about it because
everyone watches these logs so if I say
this and then everyone would know what
they're working and cuz I can't see
anything you just gonna have to wait
until Christmas to paint it I'm very
excited about Christmas this year I
think I'm finished my Christmas shopping
I did most of it online so I think what
I'm gonna do today is film and in wraps
and presents put them under the tree
yeah look completely crazy that's here
devonee's wash today which I cannot do
in maybe I'll do that first to wake
myself up
I think last week's book finished Kara's
brush D dinner that was hilarious fun I
was not will at the after man I just
can't hang anywhere I just can't but I
was just talking to care about that and
we do not have any morning so this year
update on the way they're freezing no
snow but frost and we've wrapped up a
carpet look at this so this is our whole
we've ripped up the carpet board boards
look great
they just need sanded and they needs
would you call it
varnish so and then and the olden days
what it used to do is they used to do
this varnish thing brown in the coroner
and then just have like a carpet in the
middle which i think is really funny so
this is our floor is to stay because we
needed to drop them off the enemy
because we've got electricians coming to
do all this and then also we are getting
all of this wallpaper and this is lane
in paper but see if you look you can see
that this walls a bit messed up so we
don't really know what's going to be
underneath
but we're gonna take whole the wallpaper
off this is our actual front door by the
way that we don't use which is really
funny so everyone comes to the store and
then I we've got another front door
there and say all this wallpaper is
going gonna take it all off we're gonna
get the electrician's in because we
don't have proper sockets we've just got
these weird ones and the skirt in which
are not the way that you're going to do
it anymore so we're going to get some
more sockets put in here we're gonna get
more sockets put in here well that's so
great we need to get sockets put in here
we need to get this wall fixed there's a
bit of floor down here that needs fixed
as well
and at first I thought this was gonna be
my office but I'm actually gonna make it
the guest bedroom because it's a really
lovely room it's got big high ceilings
it's great and then it's got two wedding
doors that are just like nice scenery
and stuff and it's a really nice break
room so this is gonna be a bedroom
once this room's turn up I'm going to
move all my stuff in my office and to
here so I can still work but then we're
going to get this room done up and that
means my office will be finished which
is great living room I actually really
like the way as we just need to change
the walls but this is the living room
it's a bit messy but I just want to get
the walls changed and the curtains I
hate the curtains so much but this is
probably just thing so that's about
hamachi I think taking the carpet it's
made to host a bit called oh but I'm
used to that by now I know that's what
we were up to yes yeah that's what we
did what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go
to write a list of things I would like
to film so I'm kind of running out right
he has always asked you guys I think
today I'm gonna film us Shh
I think today I'm gonna film a
super-duper glam Christmas Eve makeup
because see when I'm looking through who
I've got loads lately it's all queer not
natural but just like quit torn down so
I think I'll do that super glam
Christmas a very me style makeup laid
back to my grungy bless her Nicola like
the usual so I'm sure someone there I'll
be like Jamie yeom is gonna see me and
I'll say yes yes I do
me and Jack I think actually we're oh
another thing someone commented seeing
they get annoyed with me saying me and
Jack and you'd rather I said Jack and I
Jack and I are going to go to blue here
tomorrow
I think or maybe Silverberg I don't
wanna start saying Jack and I I see me
and Jack they're not real but that oh
hello
hi I'm good thanks how are you hi I'm
just having some little sip I'm gonna
wait for it to cool down a bit
it's been about two hours since this
book - yeah it's taking me that long to
take it with makeup room I know that I
see this all the time but I did explain
it last week my makeup rooms may I show
you know when it gets done up I'm
getting these fitted wardrobes on on
this wall and it means that all the
stuff that I can't struggle to like keep
clean and keep like Kady can go in there
because basically what happens is when I
clean my makeup room
everything is feel like all my storage
units are filled it's at capacity which
is completely unrealistic because I get
makeup saying to me every week and I
have to keep it because I need to go
through it and make sure that it's good
and that's fine
and do that cuz it's my job and I tell
you what's good I tell you what was bad
yeah oh my Christmas presents are
absolutely I've just realized I've
forgotten to get something so I'm gonna
go and try and find out just know I'm
going to try it and film me and Cara are
gonna try and get PT tonight mmm that
