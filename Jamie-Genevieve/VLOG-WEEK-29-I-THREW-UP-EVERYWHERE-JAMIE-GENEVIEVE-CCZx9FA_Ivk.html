nice but basically long story short I
have an infection and my gum with her
wisdom teeth and I've got antibiotics so
everything's gonna be fine oh it feel
much better thank goodness we had a fun
day today apart from I just felt alright
that one is the toothache I think it's
my least favorite thing in the world I

day evening because smaller we are up
early because it is DD of electricians
coming and I actually have some Feldman
to do as well so all is good my dentist

had to cancel PT okay and that's like
four sessions but I just feel refreshed
my mo still really hurts but I'm not
taking any medicine yet so I'm gonna do
that just so it takes some kind of seat
well and see if it gets better but I
think it's definitely on its way to
healing up that's really India still
there's nothing worse than to fake the
electricians are here there's really
funny and they're riding up the room in
the hall

remember so I had like a funny little
stale in high school I was not one of
the cool kids whatsoever I had more than
that with stale
I wasn't product the popular group atoll
doesn't bother me it doesn't at school
was so hard it wasn't it was saying but
remember when I used to go and use to be
so excited about winning whatever eight
McCall's or doing my makeup whatever
kind of we buy again like I said I had a
funny little style you're looking back
and like Oh what we think n but I had to
tell you I was so excited and remember I
would go into school and it would be
like a good Pichette girls would be like
whispering and talking and laughing and
immediately makes me feel like pure Oh
like oh I don't feel good it'll feel
good it's such a shame because see when
I meet people in about unless someone
comes straight up to me and says I know
yo you jimmied editor sometimes if it's
like people in a group what they'll do
is they'll whisper and laugh and point
and stuff like that and I totally forget
that it's a nice thing as great you guys
