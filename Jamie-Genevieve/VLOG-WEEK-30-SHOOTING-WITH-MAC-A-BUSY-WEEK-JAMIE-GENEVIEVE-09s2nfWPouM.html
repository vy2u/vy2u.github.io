the book of dust by Philip Pullman and
when I was younger I don't know if you
guys remember he wrote the Northern
Lights trilogy it's called Dark
Materials and it's like Northern Lights
something else and in the amber spyglass
and I absolutely loved those books I
used to read them all time actually
might really thought again anyway but I
asked the guy in the bookshop I was like
I heard if this is good or not and he
started talking about as mad Philip
Hillman this first books were about
being an atheist and this one based on
Trump or something and I think what's
not it's actually affection about little
creatures on your shoulder like you need
to hold it and and then I've got a
notebook and I'm really excited with
this it's one of the ones it's like a
grid and I thought it really good for
rate and down ideas cuz always have
ideas for videos or even like things
that we want to buy like outfits and
stuff at there and indeed like always
forgetting dates and stuff so I thought
that I could get a notebook that's small
enough from a bag that I can just stick
in my bag right stuff own now
wait hich name and I got out cause the
jump rope because I'm going for
afternoon tea with my girls tomorrow to
st. Andrews so I thought that's cause I
cause I jump through be good because I

nice jumper and it's like it looks white

color and it's nice I got a lot of pair
of gloves for a ski and nothing special

fall I wouldn't hurt my hands I got
bubbles that look like cable ties an SD
card for the camera I got a cool pair of
hoop earrings that have like gold balls

but I was in the car and the snapchat
filter with the glasses

glasses try them on right good thick
