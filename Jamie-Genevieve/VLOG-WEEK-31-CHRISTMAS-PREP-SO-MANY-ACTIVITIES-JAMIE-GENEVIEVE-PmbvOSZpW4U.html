heat in it a constant temperature so the
house is pretty cozy but we have so many
blankets and stuff on the couch so
they're a wash Oh things fresh I love

like a really thin layer so I can care
more strides that almost away and put
more makeup on which is good but yeah
it's peeling from here I think up here
and stuff we'll go over the next couple
of days but it's been the most gentle
thing ever and I bought I think my skin
is looking we smooth right up here I
don't know what's going on with my
forehead but anyway that was my fault
