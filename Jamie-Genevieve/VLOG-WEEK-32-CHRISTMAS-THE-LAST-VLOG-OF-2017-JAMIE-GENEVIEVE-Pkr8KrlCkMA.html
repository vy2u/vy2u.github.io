it's called
stardew valley the geekiest game ever
basically owned a farm any plant plants
harvest them and you sell them and I've
been pleading at the last three days
yesterday I lost the day of my life to
this game today I'm going back to the
bill forum I think it's the last station
on my jaw line
what's a cult Excellus Excellus elite is
cold and it's the last one of those
because I've had sex now so I'm starting

weeks from today which is my last
treatment it's when you see the biggest
difference but laws you guys are seeing
lovely lovely stuff on met Instagram
photos in that which is great but
quickly well or on the subject of
Instagram for tours I wanted to mention
something because it really really
happens right hardly ever happens but
people see that I look quite different
and video is compared to Instagram
of course I bloody do I don't walk about
it like this do not mean if you really
want me to start walking a bit like that
then that's fine but I think it goes a
bit of an ear of I don't know asshole I
don't want to walk about pause an old
time this is my real life and I don't
walk about looking like that all the
time I do it take a bloody good selfie
compared to what I can look like in real
life but if you guys still want to see
my double chins and stuff like just stay
still nursing that but this is real life
and in real life I do have double chins
never I just I think I was creating a
given I think I saw of it obviously
people look different in photos I take a
bit of bloody 54 tours and I pick my
favorite favorite favorite one and put
it online here I don't have that option
