I'm very sorry
'we don't know are you buying a mallet

been playing this game for about a week
Street no 20 I was in ten minutes
and here in the course of like a less
than a week yeah I can't play my game I
can't watch the news you can't watch
black murder
excellent well you didn't you mad dog
me and Jackie just jump in the car we
are going entertain I have an
appointment with Lebel form I'm getting
some tall pups the usual the usual and
in Laura's really really great so we'll
go into a little bit remember there and
we're also going to go to Nirvana which
is a piercing studio and I'm gonna get a
plastic thing from mullet and I'm gonna
get another little one for my ear cuz it
came out for all you guys ask me all the
time I get all my agility from there
apart from my lip piercings sometimes I
get them from the girl who pierced my
lip her name is gemstone piercing if
you're looking for her she now works in
London at love he a social club and
that's what we're doing on this vein
where didn't see I was gonna film film
this morning but I'm not will nowhere I
feel really shitty to do I was coughing
all night dad can't remember
let's coughing all night and I woke up
and everything just feels really dry and
Scratchy so this week is turned out to
be a bit of a quiet week but I think
what I'm gonna do is plan Lords get
filming next week before we go and then
I'm going to film when I'm where are we
as well this time
look if I like it easy face Jimmy here
with Florida blotter Miller my gal and
I'm just getting some 12 bucks before we
go away obviously start the year it's
really really busy this month so I just
want to be looking you know my best say
Lord I just have probably look at our
days we are doing a few things today
return it something news well they were
just seeing Lord I was looking at my jaw
she's not seen me and in six weeks no
actually she's not seem in three months
yeah three months lot of says that you
see a real difference of my jobs
obviously Lord as you see looking at
faces we've still got three weeks until
the final results so what we're doing is
we're doing a little bit of filler at
just in my jaw just right at the back at
the front just to try and sharpen
everything up which i think is gonna
really complement the treatment I've
been doing with Carlene where I just got
a tiny wee bit of filler on my
cheekbones and then a little tiny bit my
lips just to even them back out again
because one side of my lips goes down
quicker than the other and yeah just
thoughtful talks off but this is a lot
after the whole video and all the stuff
I get done if you guys can go and watch
I will probably do an updated one this
year because we have been trying out
other things but I really think that the
most important thing when you're getting
things like this done is that you go to
a complete professional wait Laura I
never leave looking crazy I never people
were always asking me what I've had done
they don't know what I've had anything
done sometimes it's great so it's just
all about moderation
I'm not get and mills and all over my
face it's literally tiny wee bets just
to make really slight adjustments and
enhancements and like I say in every
video if you're not a fan of that thing
just feel free to leave and come back
next time when I'm going back to here
somewhere
no pain no gain
yeah so this is my job before I'm so
excited for that I'm so excited
you've done house is it oh my god takes
away that we came but yet
eh what the heck
who's Trish you're just going to feel
Aviva pushing them forward and get off
create about that I'm just going to
leave a really away in a product Oh Dana
won't start a no it's not even a half
mil Oh Dan that was the weirdest thing
around don't look like it should hurt
I just wanted to show you guys what the
sleep sleep with a bullet filler because
when I get my lips done that's when I
started really swirling our I'm so dude
something starts nice just taking that
we just always make sure what I'm w/o so
pretend you can't see my lips right Joe
explain is southpark game I probably
will not be vlogging that much for the
next 24 hours because it's just not fair
i swell really badly really badly and
it's like instant so there's no point in
you guys see my lips like that's because
this is not what they're gonna look like
I've not had my lips done properly in
ages but I still got less than half a
melon them and yet my chin and jaw look
so good home time I'm gonna just work on
my diary and plan out the rest of the
month and veggie wasn't stuff like that
and have a D in house because I cannot
walk so basically my face is so swollen
it's no contain my camera's weight today
this is great the reason I'm not filmed
yesterday I just cleaned the house all
day I did life admin and it was bullying
which day I was going to have my plans I
was going to take away tonight for my
friend Lisa's birthday I was going to go
to the chat which I am actually still
wouldn't go to the gym just because I've
messed too much I feel terrible because
I miss so much and over Christmas I
wanted to feel really bad it's like
one of those scientists a cold sore sore
nose and a sore throat if your character
Oh like oh you like nice look at your v
jacket means Obama the guys don't walk
and a man needs must
it's Tuesday
no it's ready
it's called gonna go to the back we're
going go to the park
[Laughter]
I'm not well it's 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and I'm having a bath
oh my god that's fine oh yeah it's gone
okay I'm having a bath shaker box was
really good but we had to take it easy
to label cause I was so sick a house
meant great state and I can't go when it
was a character's for dinner and I'm
just gonna drive home because home does
not well I'm really glad I had a t-shirt
that I could tell everyone how I was
feeling
uh yeah Danny just cursory sickness and
he'll forever you shouldn't be sweetie I
didn't know they were gonna know it's
sweet sweet taste and we were talking
about the wedding event which was good
listen see we were talking about the
major event which is really good all the
guys in a VA policies I can't remember
the last time I was this sick I knew I
see I'm not there all the time but it's
just funny if I don't feel perfect
I'm not well that's all right judge it
but I've got a hope you're just from
pray this is Billy greens and I drink it
first off I got some kettle for my
boogies and I have one drumstick lolly
to make me feel better
Jack and yeah I can't realize how I was
this sick with being like hungover first
or like let myself get out but I think
that what's happened as I felt a wee bit
unreal for a long time and no it's it's
happened it's happened and it's here and
it's me and this is it has done it Cara
it was great really taste they talked to
it the red and a bit which is really
good I'm really excited because
obviously we came back and I see we're
getting right next year 2019 but a fun
time I'm really say it I don't look if I
am
I had the worst sleep I realize they had
to like put myself up so I could breathe
my face still super swollen it's just
taking me ages to get over this cold /
Suellen it's looking good though I'm so
happy with the results obviously my eyes
are just so puffy so puffy and my lips
are starting to go down the bottom lip
is probably the most one I got a new
little piercing as you can see it's got
a diamond on top and on the bottom not a
real diamond obviously and then I also
got this little jeweled piercing here
and for everyone that asked me her my
star earrings are from the wear a gift
from Charlotte Tilbury and I actually
think that she designed them so I don't
I don't think you can pray her which is
really really sweet I'm so lucky to have
them but for you guys I'm sorry no I
don't know where you can get them but
obviously cause I'm sick I can't film
like this my face is still swollen so I
don't really want to film when my face
is swollen after I've just had anything
done I seem to get the most comments
about it and it doesn't hurt my feelings
or anything like that but I just cannot
be bothered with people talking
about my face so what I thought I would
talk about in this vlog is bullet
journaling so the people that I like to
watch the most are Jamie page and then
in her video she mentioned a girl called
Amanda Lee and they both do bullet
journal videos and I bought all the
stuff so this is my new billet journal
it's orange because I just want to pick
a color that made me happy yellow is so
dope I love the color yellow but this is
an orange one and basically the papers
really effects all your ink bleeds
through and it's dotted rather than
lanes or squares so you can kind of
create your own little spread and stuff
like that so I'm really excited about
this and I think it's gonna help me get
in the mindset of getting ready for
padding ribbing I also got some pens
left hand these ones and I think I'll
probably just use the extra frame one
for a end but you've also got fain and
bold
I go tombow dual brush pens so these are
like watercolor paints and these are all
grade these are a bit of an impulse off
you're gonna see the darker ones in here
but they're an impulse purchase because
you're a great experiences but these are
the clean color real brush and there's
loads of them and basically they've got
a really nice tip that you can do kind
of colorful stuff so you can make your
money so colorful and then these ones
actually have a brush tip and a little
rate and tip is real so today I'm
actually watching the skins desert do
you guys remember skins I was like my
favorite program when I was young it
also got sex packs of my Johnson's white
souls run out and there are cheaper on
Amazon and I'm going to plan out my
village or another I think today so I'm
scared to draw on it because it's a new
flesh book I'm scaring kissing mess up
oh and also got I blow razors forgetting
here we are above my brain beans on
toast
Allah Jack the Crafton I basically just
copied Jamie pages cuz it's great to
been dating goals memory bank so I can
make and all the good things that happen
a fitness tracker here and then places
I've been in a copy Jamie on that one
too oh it's a good look I've done hmm
thanks good
so they used to keep on your hand bike
yes I wish I was a bit older on the
plane in that because it takes octane
mm-hm
I wish I was better at it but I'm not
that I'm not that neat thanks for making
me lunch
hey bullet journal on pages start
accommodate this better set hello my
meat in here
hello viewers Elias Lee it's may
see the page has bleeded through blade
whatever another point if you want spell
and wardrobe Herman to tear the pho as
soon as I start actually rate and stuff
in it looks messy because my Andre and
Julie merci I don't know what to do
target but I've heard it more pages out
then it's ruined ruined Jack how you
doing it get into you well there's a
good thing that's a start
it back it fresh start cool okay that
was meant to happen I'm on page 21
I hate that I hate this I hate this I
think I don't know how to lead I say I
don't know how those do it honestly but
yeah you know what I mean we're back
fresh we're back fresh that's that whole
little wallet of paper
oh that sucks so much that you me
 ages I'm just not tidy enough
maybe any stickers or stencils and I've
just making rain look like the other
ones I've seen which means they're not
really mine you know I think what I'm
gonna have to do is just really simplify
it and not have to not do all the fancy
 I dunno many times I've written
down the word 2018 goals I don't have
any I'm too stressed to make any horse
they don't happen I'm chip J say I think
I need just my phone I can delete things
and then pretend it never happened okay
we're back to square one everything is
going to be okay
so Jack Swagger idea was that I can
watch my big idea was that he can play
his PlayStation on his VR thing and I
can watch my TV show the same thing and
he's actually right oh my god I look
like a potato ah
you just turned it off how's that one
know she'll tell you and I had so much
work to do before going to New York we
