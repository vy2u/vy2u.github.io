getting picked up in a very 15 mats
we've got two suitcases each they're not
all filled but I just know that I want
to go I'll be better shopping in New
York so we've got some space to bring
stuff home
obviously it's went I saw the winter
clothes they they take up a lot more
room you look so handsome
there's a most of a compact pretty much
of it in half so I bet this is they
saved my case cause mustn't I don't say
that that's good and yeah we're leaving
mom and dad are gonna be here in about
an hour that drop was not going to be by
himself for long I'm gonna mess you
Lord's body
Oh check then
you know here we come
the skies
but I

you gave
she bad she bad
just for these Jimmy just smelled our
champagne and then it is Maloney bar
don't you
sexy aim Jack still sleeping and I am
just about to get picked up to go and do
a little shoot with keels so I killed
all the day kills is like one of my
favorite brands all right and it just so
happens that keels is based in New York
and a good friend of mine works for
kills and asked me to do some content
for them so I am going to do that this
morning our hotel room is sick but only
to show you before I get back in Jackson
or sleeping but yes it's actually am
have sex cult I'm feeling good I tell
them the one hotel at Central Park and
it's Nate doneita it's gorgeous
I don't know if you guys were abate but
when me and Jack stayed in Miami last
year we stayed at the one hotel in Miami
and it's a same chain
you don't understand until you get to
New York but all the hotel rooms are so
small but this one is a great size look
at our debate ah so you chat on the day
bed and watch the people's doing there
at the people on the street we've got a
little bit of a New York sky lighting on
the goal like very cute is it's all just
like reclaimed wood TV the bathrooms my
favorite look at this sassy little
see-through shower and toilet I'm very
glad that we're getting made we know
each other very well what's over that
was fill philosophy it's like recycle
and then renewable energy you can see it
with a dead clock so cool yeah it's like
moss and stuff above the beds
everything's within their keycards for
the balls like long wooden talking's
really cool
welcome into the years
so it's just stop Rena and ignore it the
street traffic there's just something in
me and Jack went to 40 karats and
Bloomingdale's for something quick to
eat it's just really easy and healthy
and now I'm going to Nikhil spa for a
special phase one take off all my makeup
it'll be great and that's right here
here's the chestnuts I don't know
no they don't turn into asleep used to
put them on a stick we just must wrench
them through some of these food carts
smelling clear that we smell we're going
to Times Square and I feel like an
intervention that official was the best
show I've ever had in my entire life
Johanna pit work set The Kills spa thank
you so much that was the best
thing ever
honestly if any of you guys are in New
York and you feel like treating yourself
you need to break in and go and see
Joanna to kill Safari because that
facial was everything baby newborn baby
look how smooth my skin looks so
basically the treatment I got was the
Hydra facial elite which included LED
lights
and you would never guess it but I've
had tons of extractions on my face so
all the is open my skin but it
still looks super fresh and not red one
of them says we're going for dinner
tonight at jams which is at the bottom
of the one hotel but fresher big ones he
came square because you have to when
you're in New York doing here you just
have to and can you believe it I'm out
and about it with no makeup on that's
pretty good I feel big my skin feels
that knows you you guys see this
billboard right here that was on there
three feels like
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
