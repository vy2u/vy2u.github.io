hello I just got back to the hotel room
oops a Kojak had waiting for me to say
congrats so I feel like it's been such a
kind of what a wind that I've maybe not
explained to you quite what's happening
today was the best day ever
I think it's the highlight of my career
thus far I went to the MATLAB but she'll
have seen little snippets of I will see
you don't know what the shade my
lipstick is if somebody you can guess
then great but I'm not gonna be showing
you the color until we're close to
launch because today we created the
shades but they're not gonna be for sale
until spring summer so we're not quite
sure what month yet oh god right I just
had to take my hair doing sales just
looking a little bit crazy today we went
around the kinda production facility and
we saw how they make MAC lipsticks we
weren't allowed to film because
obviously they use certain techniques
and products and machinery there's like
a really really top secret but it was
really cool it was so exciting and it
was one of the coolest things I think
I've ever seen like it was not cuz
that's what we did in the morning and
then we had some lunch and then we went
to the lab and started creating our own
shades so I'm not gonna show you guys
what it is yet and I'm not gonna tell
you what it is a few you guys are
guessing which is really cool so I'd
love to know what you think I'm gonna
create and in the comments down below if
you want to do that but it was just the
most surreal experience ever I was
amazing it's something that I never
thought I would ever do I'm so touched
and honored to be asked to do it I was a
makeup artist for so long and when I was
makeup artist we used to go to Mac every
week so I could stock up on my cat I
would use Mac on my clients all the time
I wanted to get a job at marks so bad in
the beginnin and I just couldn't I
worked as the laws are for two years and
they are owned by the same company so
it's just kinda came full circle and
it's the most exciting thing about so
that's what I've been doing today
this is not the lipstick by the way I am
clever and I changed it and then tonight
we are just going for a bag dinner with
everyone that has collaborated because
basically as people all over the world
there's 12 influencers in total me and
Patricia blade from the UK who is great
we spent all day together though her
lipstick is stunning beautiful I tried
it on and it's it's so beautiful and it
looks unreal on her as well after we had
made our lipsticks we did a photo shoot
which is obviously going to be the image
to kind of promote the lipstick which
was really really cool as well -
photographer it was great the studio was
great the lighting was great everyone
was feeling great we were wearing our
own lipsticks like it's it was amazing
Narim back in hotel two more days until
until and then we're off home and it's
just been the best thing ever I have
posted on Instagram a couple of pictures
just her name's my collaboration and I
cannot believe your guys's comments and
response and love and support it just
means the world to me I'm just super
overwhelmed I just can't believe it I
said it's just crazy if you guys have
been here for a long time on Instagram
you'll know that I was a working makeup
artist for so long and then I went
full-time with YouTube and Instagram
just like a year and a half ago like
it's not been that long and this is just
such a dream come true without you guys
this would not be happening I am so glad
for to every single one of you and thank
you so much for just your support
and I honestly can't believe that people
will wear my lap state like they're
gonna wear that and I'm gonna maybe bump
into them and they'll say I've got your
lipstick oh that's just the best thing
in the world so very excited we've got a
couple hours before dinner I need to
repack my case because it's literally
all over the place and apart from that
you'll have to wait and see you're gonna
wear my lipstick I'm gonna give you a
big kiss and you're gonna have to wait
up cheers you guys
