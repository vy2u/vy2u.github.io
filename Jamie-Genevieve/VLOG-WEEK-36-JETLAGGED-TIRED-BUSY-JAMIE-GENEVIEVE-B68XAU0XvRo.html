today because I'm chard and I'll look at
a bloody look tired as well so just on
that Jack's a week and a haircut just
now the weather up here is above a
nightmare the snow is really thick and
it's not for a budget our cars already
getting out but like one of our postman
got stuck in the drive today he was
there like I'm never trying to get out
the car that picked us up from the
airport couldn't drive up the drive we
had to carry our cases down the street
and then up our drive it's just crazy so
I've been in the house all day today I'm
gonna try and go out to get to PT but I
know that everything in class was just
pretty much shut down because of the
snow it's crazy so that's what's
happening that's what we've done we've
managed to do already today considering

accidents trying to grab them off the
conveyor belt thing and they just pinged
off so need to go get my nails fixed
tomorrow I'm so disappointed in myself
because last week the only videos that I
got up where the weekly vlog so I'm
really sorry about that guys

would have enough free time to film a
video like me and Jack could have done
her cuny but it was just too crazy
honestly we don't have any spare time
we're constantly on flights or
it was just bad man that's crazy but
we're home for a week a week today we
are leaving again so we've got a week to
kind of get yourself sorted before we're
off again and then in between that type
when we get home from the Maldives I
think I've got about two or three days
