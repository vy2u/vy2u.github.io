blister

makeup so that's all that matters and
hopefully it will heal but I look crazy

have managed to find some really easy
ways to add more nutrition and to my
diet and be healthier and lose about we
so if you guys want me to do videos on
that I think I can make them a bit
nervous because I'm definitely not at
math end goal yet but I suppose their
process and the journey can be shared

that this year I partnered with benefit
as one of their bro heroes which is sick

know what to say I'm just so grateful
and yeah I'm so upset because all the
t-shirts that I have like my personal
ones are all in the water I didn't bring
any with me and honestly the site and
making everything like that has taken
ages I didn't know it was gonna happen
yesterday like I didn't come down to
London thinking that I would be able to
launch 30 shows as soon as we did so I'm
really happy that we've done it
yesterday when it went live it's presale
so all the teachers are getting say no
unlike the 16th and
I think that you guys are gonna crack up
when you see I hope good to call ears

show they're so comfortable they come
any cool package that you can keep it's
like it's the best and I didn't want it
to be like marriage I didn't want it to
be late agenda
I just want them to be cool I wanted it
to be something that if I see it in a
shop I was like oh my god I have a bias
to it it's comfortable and quality I
didn't want any kind of act like trap
t-shirts to mean so I can't wait I can't
wait I'm so happy and you guys have made
my life I was so emotional yesterday
