photos finished and the personal show up
in part was all show up oh my god
absolutely it's from this video for you
guys I tried on so many different
periods jeans that I just would not have
tried on if someone hadn't picked them
out from them Carolyn is actually
considered the reflection this is her I
just asked
and basically the Paris of Chopin is a
totally free service you just need to
bookend I feel like I needed this like I
needed someone to pick her clothes for
me that I wouldn't usually pack or sales
because I want to say I'm absolutely
present it's almost for you guys you're
gonna track up denim forever so I just
came across this article and the daily
they're cooked and it's me I basically
mean to are bubbling I walk or in a limo
is it on Tuesday I think it was I walk
up a country to it and let the fields
and things around us and we seen a flock
of sheep four sheep pack a sheep we've
seen a bunch of sheep and one in the
fields and one of them was little
hanging upside down was legs in the
check-in and flashing flashing I vote
make more easily really low the other
she put her in debt on the way so so I
quickly googled it as to why he may be
on this bike I found out that they can
become trapped on my back if they're too
heavy
like if a pregnant or the fleece is wet
if they're all over they can get trapped
on the back the grass they this eaten
can ferment stomach and that's what just
is like a gas and if it upside down in
the gas can escape so they can suffocate
and die vulnerable to Klaus the FAQ in
them and things like that as well so I
jumped over the fence ran up rolled over
on his way eggs show you up here
so basically their daily die cut packed
up and I put a display at the world so
thanks very much
I had loads of people commenting on the
original Porsche so many people in the
same boat as me obviously didn't know
you know that was even a thing she'd
kick trapped in my backs or there was
bad for them by 400 and course the six
hundred thousand viewers and late to
these service provider snow you know
money she Jimmy went vital to this week
for but I pretend I'll show you here
coach potato morning and it's got some
parcels let's open them together

stating a refreshing spray and it's like
through unicorn stuff magic strobing
brush toothpaste leaves the festival
I shot a pilot it's got a little horsey
friend that does have stuff in it

keep this for home security and then
we've got a little brochure that says
life to face the world oh I'm gonna pour
a real coffee this morning not my
Nescafe council coffee and it's really
strong is Thursday I've had a really
busy week I've been doing stuff every
single day I've had
either meetings or appointments and I've
been slowly going through my makeup room
I'm nearly finished and then I'll be
able to give you a little bit of a tour
of my time to the makeup room which are
actually really bloody like like I'm
much happier and then this morning I am
getting ready I'm driving over to get
snack because I'm going to see Caroline
you guys will remember Caroline gave me
my treatment underneath my chin which I
really thinks work I think that like
anything oh my god dropper here I think
like anything those treatments really
work when you are having a healthy diet
and exercising at the same time so it's
really optimum results you are a
balanced diet and your exercise and you
get this done and it just I think it's
really helped sculpt out my chin a few
guys know me if you've been here for a
little while then you'll know that
that's kind of like my problem area I
would say that underneath my chin gives
me stress we're gonna see some after
pictures because we're taking it before
pictures already just to see what the
difference is and I'm also getting the
patch tests for laser hair removal which
I am so excited about it then I'm gonna
come home I've got some stuff to drop
into onyx onyx is the makeup sound I
used to work in when I was a freelance
makeup artist I'm gonna draw a pen see
the girls drop off some makeup and then
me say the Jean and Jane Oracle to go
for dinner tonight and some drinks so
I'm really excited
Cara and I have a meeting at 11 o'clock
in the morning with our grad school
waiting venue but I'm really excited
about it you guys know that I've briefly
spoke about array then we really want to
get raised and actually obviously not
everyone could come to Italy so it's
like a more of a small way to note there
and then probably want to have like a
break
in Glasgow that we can invite all my
friends and family to so that is the
plan so I got my laser started totally
fine not as soon as I thought it was
gonna be
and that is where kattiline at Cynergy
I'm gonna just link her Instagram down
below because she is amazing for the
facial treatment that I got done we took
after pictures before difference
and obviously the laser and then it's
late change of plan Jack is just
dropping me off at sailor jeans hose and
I am about to meet some really special
little guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
