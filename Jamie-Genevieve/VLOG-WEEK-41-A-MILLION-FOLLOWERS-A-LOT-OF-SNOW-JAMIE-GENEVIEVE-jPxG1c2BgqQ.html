of knew it was gonna happen anyway but I
was if I had turned around to get my
phone then I would have messed my me in
there was no ATM nearby so yeah it had
to get ticket how's your Monday wait
when I did not wear this jumper to the
meter and actually put it on and then
realized how they're gonna think I'm
crazy if I turn up to meet link oh good
I love your stuff bring your jumper was
there any morning I feel a bit panicked
today I don't even feel like I don't
feel stressed and I just feel like
panicky I'm panicking a bit everything
just a bit stressed I think it's because
honestly you guys I'm 3,000 away from
hitting a million on Instagram I don't
know what to do with myself of what what
happens does the Sun come out some come
to my daughter's here all done I think
probably nothing and that's what I'm
nervous about yeah there we go that's
that done it was neat a dog
she's so funny
look I look and there's remembered
beneath habitate ponytails and the
finger back the bangbang
I'm gonna make a compilation there you
just turn around going up making me part
it you look at some today I have a
portage and now I'm with Caroline I
don't get it in laser hair removal I'm
nervous again there's not sorry I know
what's thought of sources little home
nervous my okay I just go home from the
laser totally fine literally so we did
basically everything and electric happen
everywhere and I'm not gonna like it's
not not sore but it's not it's not agony
and it goes away straight away so once
like it you basically it zapped sure you
feel it for a second and then it goes
away and then the pain is gone like
forever it like it doesn't hurt
afterwards and it's so worth it I'm
gonna be like any kids smooth like a
snake like a snake in other news I just
got home JAXA we go to tease mom
it's nearly March its proper snowing
outside its London and our flippin
boiler broke I was on the phone to
Scottish gas which a P a fortune for
every year and now it's broken
it just keeps on flashing EA making mad
stones and actually this the storms hit
night is today and tomorrow and it's
freezing I'd say that's like - to oh say
tomorrow the warmest temperature is
going to be as minus 40 I'm already and
Cadiz just gonna pick me up and 15
minutes I think
and we're going for a Cuddy and we are
going to see 50 shades of grey
I don't know it's not called that Fifty
Shades freed and updating the boiler the
boiler was fine her gas is delivered in
a tank so basically what happened was we
ran out of gas and the guys were really
late and filling it up so we don't have
any gas for the morning but it's all
fine now and houses heating up
thank God
great job I'm so cool I'm so cool
I just might today's art and got my hair
done
the snow is really really bad a red
warning later on which is the first time
ever in Scotland that there's been a
warning like that and my nails are off
and my needlepoint got cancelled because
obviously the way they're so bad and
people can't really get into working
stuff never this red Warren and
everyone's can I get told to go home and
they're asking people to extend their
employees home and shut shut up for the
day basically so I was gonna go to Amy's
house which is the girl who does my
nails at nasse she's great but Jax just
told me they're basically saying don't
travel unless you really really have to
I think this is an urgent case and I do
need to travel but apparently apparently
is gonna get really really bad I'm
sitting next to the radio before
Jacqueline actually called another thing
that this way there could mean today is
way to stay like midday earthly is meant
to be on Frazee morning I really don't
know if we'll be able to get it or not
and I am gonna be so upset if we can't
get our flight there in London because
basically our flight path is from
Glasgow to London London to Dallas and
in Dallas to Mexico I just really really
hope the snow stops in time for the
runways to get cleared for a flight on
Friday I don't even think you can tell
how bad this is looking at absolutely
terrible the 49 of the snow is getting
we're going to breathe yeah the snow's
getting played by those same 50 days
later 50 days you sure you I do this yes
just like that talk take us somewhere so
lighters but doesn't mean that I swear
with mine
like a husky dog mornin
Kendall is 10 to 12 I woke up and do my
makeup I like it I like it a lot
this storm hasn't really subsided the
wind is just kicking up all the snow
basically our plan of action is the
airport still shut by the way it's meant
to open up in three hours our flight is
tomorrow at 6 a.m. so it sent about 15
hours from now don't know if it's gonna
happen but I think the best thing to do
is to be prepared for it to happen I
think we're just gonna chill out a
little bit we'd all really have that
much food in the house
so we're gonna have to venture do at
some point to get some food but
everybody shut all the shop and say
knows all the moles around here or shot
I don't know what we're gonna do oh my
god mom and dad in their cat and I've
managed to get here the roads are fine
apart from when I go out to the beep of
hermandad live it's not too fine very
deep snow I just had 999 thousand
dollars I don't know I think I'm gonna
hit a million cooped up in this house
that's happening really excited feel
this sick I'm following it so I just
literally like I just hit hit look at my
girl steals oh my god I'm gonna have a
million with no nails how long
I've got my torch shinin on my face
we're in a car with all our stuff and
we're goin to the Grand Central Hotel
which is really close to Central Station
so basically what we're going to do is
we're going to wake up really early in
the morning and see what the situation
is with the airport I think I think
carefully it's cancelled but everywhere
and Glasgow then we can just walk along
the street to the train station and
hopefully get a tray and first thing
ever you can do that then we should get
into central London a decent enough time
to get to Heathrow and then hopefully
just catch a flight somewhere in America
today in connect and go to Mexico that
that is the plan this has turned into
the biggest adventure dad's driving us
right now he is breathing degree
outdoors to drop us off in town like I
said earlier I don't think a taxi to go
up to her house or someone else coming
tea parties on this side this is the
craziest thing very I'll show ya so
there's my dad going day and see what
this guys doing
he's moving backwards still he's God

do you think is gonna happen tomorrow
