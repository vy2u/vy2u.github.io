ever-so-slight from 9 till 9 and woke up
with a bit of a sore throat
my boys were starting to go in Mexico I
think it was the air corn but yeah guys
everything's good the trip was so much
fun it was really good seeing everybody
and hanging out and having fun the only
thing with all this traveling that I
find it hard as still filming like
obviously you guys know that we do these
weekly vlogs which are great it makes
that a lot easier when we travel because
it's like we can film everything and
show you guys but it's like the normal
content from my YouTube was really
difficult to get done before and after I
go
so my plan is to film enough cuz I
always try and get my vlog and always
try and get a video at least one video
if I get two brilliant if not at least
there's two videos a week going up you
know and then I try it on Instagram you
know you guys know I post to the planet
weekend Sammy oh if I'm gonna do life
admin today makes me feel way better
plan I know everything is in order and
sorted you could see my accountants
Katie I put my makeup away so it doesn't
get in a mess because this is what
happens I put it off for too long and
then it gets crazy and they I'm gonna
make a little bit of a plan because I
never do this but I wouldn't make a part
of what I'm gonna film because there's a
couple of videos I've wanted to do for
literally years that I've never done
because I've never planned it Jack still
