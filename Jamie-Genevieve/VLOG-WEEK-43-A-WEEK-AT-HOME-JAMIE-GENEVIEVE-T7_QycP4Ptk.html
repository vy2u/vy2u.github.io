akiza okay all right everything a
struggle
hello week number 43 I think hey I
maintain parts and Abrams carpet as
always and I am getting my nails done
man
finally I've had meat hands for too long
yours these knees to Jimmy massive
congratulations on a brilliant year ago
days will be those
[Laughter]
I like her all that grub this is my pal
this is your pal nice YUM that I was
food prep sort it looks so good I'm
gonna have my chicken satay what you've
actually had before but the change the
recipe and I am so excited that might
say it's be home this week and to build
eat well and work out this company I'm
just heating up my dinner just now it's
called Fitness captured and I wouldn't
length of doing the law because it's a
glassful company and basically if you
don't know there's a shot there's a
career stride or in at Bath Street and
I'll get you more if you divide in this
again there's a store like a restaurant
or an advice treating glass with it you
can go ahead and you can sit in and get
like a proper dinner breakfast lunch
it's open till technical pretty much
every day
apart from Sundays so you go they make
the meals fresh an emergency I know I
don't want to I can see yeah they make
the meals afresh on 28 so if you go to
Monday your meals will last like look at
this I'm gonna do this until a
until until he does it again hey I just
 up with us when your needs for so
I'm just going to tell you it and
totally does it but they make the meals
fresh on a Monday in the last four five
days it's just the way that it's like
made and it's delicious and I'm very
excited you know gonna do it but they
just want some water okay you get your
meals keep them in the fridge you can
freeze them as well if you want but the
last five days and honestly for us is
this ideal at first I was thinking like
even if I get like lunch for every day
it means I'm definitely getting a super
healthy balanced meal but we went I'll
be back move it ham and I'm gonna be
trying to do lunch and dinner some days
and then I was like oh a couple of like
free meals are over
hello I'm in tone again I'm going for
the correct meet in a bit something I'm
faced about and after I'm actually going
for a massage and it's not like a pure
them I said I'm going to try and get my
back so today I don't mourn about it
about him I got quite bad back at the
top when I'm filming and stuff if I do
it's weird it's just from doing makeup
right but when I was a makeup artist
whenever I would do makeup always had my
head to the side like this and that's
totally from my neck up when I was
really young I used to work in a bar and
I pulled my back out left in my k-cup
which is sort standard that's like so
cliched and then whenever I get a
massage I think they say this to
everybody but everyone's always like you
need to get your back sorted out and I
just think I'm like yeah that's cuz you
want my money yes I've got my meat and
in ten minutes then I'm going to get my
massage you're gonna think me and Jackie
boy are going
does he like fanfare and cinema maybe
I'll be really good just posted a little
before-and-after of my current fitness
state basically like before I started
cycle box and then this morning and I
was really nervous it's a poor state
just because I think I'm gonna do a
whole video in this shape but I don't
think you guys really ever saw what my
body was like like a year ago because I
had it really real I pulled really good
in four so you couldn't ever tale and it
wasn't just like I was a bit troubling
like I was unhealthy it wasn't fair at
all I was eating so much crap I drank a
lot and yeah I'm just really a bit
emotional actually at all the amazing
the place and responses it's really
amazing so I think I'm gonna do a little
video on that I said for ages that I'm
gonna show you guys a really easy
fitness routine that you can do at home
you don't have to have a personal
trainer like Mandy's amazing she Mandy
owns the cycle box basically right and
psycho box is actually a class so I see
I'm gonna cycle box but circle box is
actually an hour-long class it's like 30
minutes to spend 30 minutes of books and
but I do personal training with her and
she doesn't actually do personal
training for anyone else so I'm really a
special girl I must but I feel really
really honored because she is just such
a hero like she's she's the best and
she's actually just such a good person
as well like spending three hours were
for every week easy as pie
and me and Cara
who's my maid of honor best pal we go
together all the time so that makes it
even better
it wasn't just a case of me starting to
work out I kind of had to change the way
that I thought about food the way that I
would reward myself and just my actual
lifestyle and taking care to myself but
I just didn't I didn't used to do it I
know I got feel in myself happy and
healthy and working out it helps me
sleep
it helps my mood I'm happy all the time
and I think that watching it has a huge
part to play in it and also eating well
and putting good things into my body
when the Marvel films can we couldn't
see them wait but first one in the
backbone though because we've been so
busy so I'm finally getting to see it
two months after this release someone
thinking this is gonna be very good
we've already had our meal today we had
chicken sausage and chicken sausage
sweet potato mash Peter penny it was
really really good and yeah sending my
time I look good at cinema especially
the one up here with those those
reclining seats but it's hard to see
when you're trying everything you know
on a good diet as Hoffman at the cinema
no well you're gonna get answers aren't
you I find that it's hard to what the
cinema and stay even clean I'm not and
you know I will get no I'm learning at
nice black Paisley
that's nothing I'm 100% sweet
do we have to pay parking you have to
pay
this morning I went up and I went to
Mia's art we put my little extensions in
got my hair straightened up but black
panther is really good
not enough superhero stuff in it for me
I'm a big Marvel find a big DC Comics
fan but I like it when the you know I
see loads of powers and fate in and
exciting stuff and there was the bets
that were in that that were like that
were amazing but there wasn't tons of it
but I thought the film issues are really
good and that's update Jack's at the gym
the is morally v Mindy we got here is
that a nice one is it green chilly
I think Thai curry good eating Thai car
a Thai green curry
well I was good you know gonna come
watch the chokes again it's a bad game
can't mess up I feel like yeah we keep
going when it's the same exhibit I like
going when there's new exhibit yeah but
it's like the flint exhibit rooms like
you know the rooms they make up the
definitely exhibits it gets boring if
you go all the time
don't that Drogba drug that Drogba you
want to go for a walk the trigger if I
walk you wanna go for a walk
what is it well did you hear something
sweet to the ears
hmm let's go for a walk

good sleep last night since been home
from a typical drug bust had a bit of an
upset stomach through the night the last

have been trying to help with his diet
and stuff like that it seems a lot
better today I've been really really
tired but today for coffee week my
porridge and then I'm gonna film this
morning and then I'm going to personal
training and when I get back home I'm
gonna start packing cause next week I am
going to Vietnam and I was so excited I
feel like thrown up this is really gonna
be amazing I'm going there with keels
basically we're going there because they
are all of a eco-friendly sourcing of
their ingredients and stuff like that
and Vietnam is where they get their
ingredients for their new face mask so
it's ginger leaf extract and I know that
