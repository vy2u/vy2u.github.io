I can't pay Massillon but wait haha 7:52
in the a.m. we made it we just got to
Vietnam were and Hanoi and were stayin
at the Sofitel but it's called Metropole
back home it's like 5:00 to 1:00 in the
morning so I'm feeling a bit funny I
feel a bit weird

plane but yeah still feel a bit strange
and I'm going to show you really quickly
the room don't let look at it too much
though but it's really cute so in Hanoi
over and there came a French Court look
at all this mess but it's like a nice
big bed nice big bathroom with a bath
and a shower and then my view at the
window it's really sweet it's like a big
green house for everyone's kind of
having a breakfast and stuff and it's
like quite a back hotel I think it wraps
the whole way around and I think there's
a pool somewhere here as well I'm not
tasting the pitcher oh my god I might
not get back up
I think whoever arranged to kind of meet
in an hour and a half I may call for a
little wonder about it because I don't
think I can sleep I don't think I should
sleep I think I should really just power
through all day I think I need a coffee
actually so let's do that and I'll show
you the hotel a little bit got my SPF on
by the way before anyone asks
you
my my bloody meeting her special so that
lord of the world
so this is called a Craig David and it's
basically a tequila short and then you
shoot the pineapple juice straight after
it and it's called a Cree David because
it is so smooth that again
