usually this cluster may get you say
your favorite window but
they do it Abed
okay guys so I have not felt yet at all
but basically I am building London
because I was filming with Janet can we
sleeked my hair she said it was nice I
died I know I like dr. Dre and I'm gonna
get some treatments and I'm really
excited I'm very excited for the
Cheetahs called me so like yeah record
the dream so I'm getting the meter left
which dr. G actually invented himself
it's gonna like fill my face full of
vitamins basically I'll go into it more
when we're getting it done and then I'm
getting a little bit of your definition
treatment on his will because you know
that I absolutely love that looking
adorable already
thanks very much am i hearing it I
literally just got a whole bunch of
goodness injected into my face but did
you see this is the best the most
beautiful I've ever looked oh I feel
like I'm not attracted to you
all day it's been a crazy dude like who
like my heroes just a recap of lost the
deal so that's great
drop by actually dope to off earlier so
go back one but today I was filming 15
Atkin it was amazing it was so good to
see it again she is just one of my
ultimate Phebe's unfortunately I did not
know that was made to take my filming
equipment with me so the only thing I
had to film with was this so when I get
home I'm gonna go the footage to Jack
and we're gonna do what we can with it
and stuck her up definitely because it
was brilliant it was really really fun
and then I went to dr. Dre who as E as a
clinic in London you've got a London
clinic and a Paris clinic and I went for
a miso facial which is basically like
loads of it immense being blasted into
your face is something that dr. Dre
created himself it's like has unique
formula and it's like a fish a little
over it only takes like 10 minutes but
it's applied with like a gun this guy
needs like don't be scared but it's I've
gone with a needle on the end of it and
it was I basically inject all your skin
with these amazing vet moans and
paid and straight away your skin looks
like unbelievable it was really amazing
it's not the cheapest it's 200 pounds
but you get it done twice a year I am
definitely going back to get it done
I can already see the results let's put
your instant but then the results
continue to work for like six months
which is sick and then I ended up get an
e calcium it was like getting feller in
my job but they use calcium instead of
fellow so it's a completely natural
product and I cannot believe the
difference obviously I've been working
on this area of my face for so long
though but this is like i sat up and I
looked in there and I was like oh my god
couldn't believe it the doctor who did
my stuff was French and then the owner
dr. Dre is playing as well and they were
just standing in front of me speaking in
French can I say I'm okay did you do it
here and here and then he pointed
underneath my eyes I never knew this was
a thing right but you just pointed and I
used to have a pretty deep crease under
my eyes it's called your eye off the
body put like hyaluronic acid under
there and I have no I bag xeni more so I
don't really know what happened but I
basically ended up gettin like a pure
facial makeover and I'm obsessed with
myself I can't believe it I don't think
it's even it was all happened to my face
is really no I got numbing cream put on
it so my thesis was a bit numb it's
coming back now but when I was getting
all this done I've kind of said send
then I was thinking sure I'm gonna end
up looking mentally remember I don't
know if you guys will remember and you
guys are so sweet that you'll see that
it wasn't the case but I went a little
bit crazy with lip filler at one point
I'm not having a little fun in ages and
if I ever do get them done I only ever
get like little tiny boats hooked up
I'll never get that crazy again and also
I was pretty nuts with the Botox at one
point of my eyebrows were like crazy I
know that I said all of those things but
I think that I've managed to get a nice
balance now yeah I thought I was gonna
end up looking like that again I was
harsh and I honestly I'm so happy I
think it smooths my chin I do like what
they've done here they've built up this
back part it's basically like what I
think I've wanted for everything I think
that all these little states that I've
been doing in this Lebel forum have
helped me get to this stage and then
those guys just like they did the dance
obviously I know for you guys in
Scotland it's not the best and you guys
in America it's not the best because
they're based in London and Paris but
that was brilliant really happy really
happy so it's a really nice surprise
I just checked into the Sanderson hotel
it is my favorite hotel well it's one of
my favorite hotels in London they're
really really sweet here
the rooms are lovely like oh sure yeah
huge bigger room I've got my bed over
there I got my little seating area I had
a pray starving got a nice big bed TV

huge big bath chic little like thinking

to London I don't have a bath is cool
