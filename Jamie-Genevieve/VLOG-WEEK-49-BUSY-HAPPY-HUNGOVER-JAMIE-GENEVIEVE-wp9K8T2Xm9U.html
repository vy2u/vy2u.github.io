been doing makeup tutorials I've been
doing some travel vlogging with it yeah
my self this way I would thought we need
them it it's good and we know what when
we won it's really flippin expensive so
it's taken as a while to get up to it
but I'm really excited to be doing
chicken extent with you today
for reference I started YouTube on my
laptop camera and then I got the Canon
1100 D which was really not expensive as
far as YouTube cameras go it was like
400 pounds for that camera handling then
I got the one I've got now which is the
ATD which is really good it's just play
standard though and the one we're
getting there is the Canon 5d Mark for
everybody can't get a new lens and we've
been one to this for months actually saw
as good as a beautiful day
you don't have the lands you wanted and
when I say for camera we wanted the
camera boy is really overkill
which I'm the real deal any other camera
all right show you guys an update oh oh
my god it's so dirty the makeup room

it's just giant now we've got a ceiling
wallpaper off all the wallpaper off

what's been happening since I've been
going away all the day there's been
working under the house the whole way

did you let me film with us here like
crazy Jamie hey I just filmed this I
look managed to get the new camera
working I think I really hope it's okay
but I thought I would quickly assure you
my setup so this is what we're working
with at the moment obviously have two
soft boxes and I Ringley behind my
camera really really basic I've had the
two softbox says for ages since we lived
in the flat the ring light as well
really really basic if you're getting
ordering late just make sure that it's a
cool light cuz otherwise it makes you
look really yellow the camera as Claudia
I'm such an idiot
so my old camera had a flip out screen
this one does not so what you have to do
is you have to use a cable to connect it
to your laptop and then you can cut out
see what you're doing from there and you
can control what you're doing from there
but I am just really not used to it yet
I'm not sure how that's gonna go on but
it's the test I look which I think's
really cute
