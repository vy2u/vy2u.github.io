delicious on a hot one yeah and guys
[Laughter]
this all I'm so dead
but a chronicle in dog and then I come
home engulfed in a nail
cuz I fingers parcels absolutely all the
place for me right now
today was of it I'm starting to lose my
voice from just flying so basically one
story short the right back up blah blah
and everything's fine
and he jumped up on Jack and I saw blood
on type of t-shirt I was like Jack was
put on your t-shirt completed Miller
time and his whole nose I'll show you
tomorrow but as whole nose look like it
was covered it looked like it was
covered in blood and totally sleep died
of a so upset and Jack was freaked out
to use angry the women had been looking
after them said it must have just
happened as soon as we picked them up
but we were late I have inherited that
just happened like it was so weird his
nose looked like it was covered in link
bumps anyway we took him back home
because he would be bit he was a didn't
seem right so we took him back home for
a cuddle
since you gave them some food and water
to make sure you thin and drinkin and he
totally campaigning he was acting normal
the dog was saying he was totally fine
everything else about from the totally
Fame but as knows the more I looked at
it the more look like an allergic
reaction so along dad got here without
had a look at it I was like yeah I think
it's allergy reactions of one debate we
took them down and basically there's no
way detail that happened cranium is in
there cured or not because it could have
happened literally the second picked him
up in which case it would be horrible
for us to become blima on someone else
but it also could have happened a few
days ago and you just don't do anything
about it which makes me sort fucking mad
because it's like my baby boy you know
so it's not good but enemies the vet
thinks he's allergic to muddy bees so if
nothing it's nothing sad it's nothing
bad but the vet thinks that he got
bitten by a video on his nose and his
whole mouth is cleared up and it
basically blistered and then the oldest
popped all the blisters just burst so
nervous just permit early man's got
bloody nose the door birthing sign it or
