doesn't it doesn't look like we're gonna
do it there so just got more time to be
nervous man
more time to think about it and with
Jack sigh thanks to all the support ago
I know we didn't raise everyone's
donations and comments and it remains
and I'm so sorry
weather is like a huge factor and and
Nina V that was saying she one of her
skies eyes that she went to Seattle
canceled because the way are there and
the next one she was waiting for a furor
so it's quite a quick comment and
obviously UK where there isn't the base
maybe we should go somewhere sunny dude
thank you so much here in the support
don't worry we are definitely doing it
we are definitely doing it just may take
a little bit longer than we thought it
might be reviled but next time I'm in
London
we're gonna
we don't manage to do it today but we
just went in state and I know I can't
believe we're setting the weekend free
to say and they've got screens up seeing
the link with the way though and there's
like a big line of rain that's just
coming coming for us right here right
here in kid like I said we're definitely
doing it so don't worry your donations

places and we're still doing the scary
thing for said donations and we are
