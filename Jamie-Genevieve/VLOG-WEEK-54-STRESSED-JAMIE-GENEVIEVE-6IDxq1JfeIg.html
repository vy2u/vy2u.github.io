freezer I actually wanted to go to our
favorite Japanese restaurant but it's a
bank holiday to shut him and Jack was
like I should have stuck to my guns
because the last time we went to Tony
macaroni is we doesn't enjoy it
no I never yeah so Jack's like 20
macular Lee's I said chili 20 martinis

absolutely terrible the people were nice
but the food was absolutely disgusting
high school is warmer than most of
mainland Europe today

Oh thing like that happy
[Laughter]

we are if you put anybody part too close
to it will use these front is just an
apple and it is so soft we call it corn
on the cob is like I bait in the corn in
the cold coffee coffee coffee before we
teach a DJ Quik run before I'm gonna go
and get ready today I'm not filming I'm
just gonna do a really it fun makeup on
myself and then I'm gonna clean my
makeup and Amy and Jack are gonna go and
see it dead pill I didn't vlog get my
nails done yesterday because I left my
camera tart in the car but how amazing
are these but a bit shorter than usual
they're called mint and then they've got
mermaid dust on top oh it's been so good
being at home I know that we are so
lucky right we were so lucky we need to
travel a little time and I love it but
there is no better feeling than coming
home and being at home for a little
while so we're home for three whole
weeks I am gonna be organizing my makeup
room because my other makeup room that's
getting done up right now because the
room I'm in right now is actually gonna
be a bedroom but we're getting the
makeup brand on up the river of
requirements christened it so I want to
have everything organized so then when
the room is finished I can just move in
what I want to keep and things like that
so yeah it's a lot it's a lot sorry and
quickly if you like reading books you
should beat this I started it yesterday
and I'm ago over a third of the way
through it is amazing I taste kind of
 at me and I was like getting this
big can beat it okay get it right now
it's nothing about women killing our
husbands which are usually like but yeah
it's really good it's like about in a
perfect world where they've got rid of
poverty and illness and all things wrong
with what I push and everything like the
world is 100% sustainable
the only thing as people are 11 they an
infinite life right so people need to
die because otherwise overpopulation and
then these sites it's their job to go
and killing people and it sounds really
morbid but it's like a reason if you
like The Hunger Games you really like
this so I'm having to tear myself away
from the bit to go into my makeup and
that's what we're gonna do right now
