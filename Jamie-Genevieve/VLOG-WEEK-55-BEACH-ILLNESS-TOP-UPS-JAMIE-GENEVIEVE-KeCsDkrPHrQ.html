one just to smooth everything out and
make me like I think you'll enjoy it as
I'm doing 25 minutes like that I feel a
bit better five and they were putting a
bit of Botox and manage all the
massacres and that's the muscle and it
just stops you from being able to clench
your teeth this hard socially going in
your teeth which I do in my sleep and
that's why I had to get all my teeth
built up and it also kind of slammed
your face then as we're not using that
muscle as much side of hmm do you know

not that much of I go my toes you do
that no scream do you scream baby babies

Emmaus an absolute mess so that's what
I'm going to do today very exciting post
I put on Instagram yesterday I timed it
so I can tell you guys in this week's
vlog and so you guys know but if you
head over to my Instagram which is just
Jamie Genevieve I'll put a link in the
description bar below you are in with a
chance of winning a thousand pounds
worth of makeup
there's a little like Emily I'm doing so
if you look for the for with the
giveaway picture you can enter the
giveaway it's gonna be
up until Freddie so this is gonna happen
Sunday you've got till free day unless
doesn't look like much but in here as
each thousand pounds worth of makeup and
it's just a fill of goodies Lords of my
favorite products Lords our highlight
and stuff you've got like brushes the
meadow lipsticks everything
tripping bags leader and we have a
somewhat acceptable rim so I think the
biggest mace was like around here and
behind this desk and on the floor here
and also on top of here which is all
sorted now so it's much better I cleaned
up my desk as well I have made a vow to
myself to not make this messy of it
again and we've just kind of faded up
everything these boxes are all good
eventually I'm going to have to go
through them again and I think I'm just
gonna have to go through them every
couple of months and just scale down and
replace things and get rid of stuff and
all that these are the three boxes I
need to go through I need to sort and to
keep give away and put in the bin
because there's a mix of old and new
stuff in there which is a bit of a
nightmare but at least it's easier to
sort now in there ha that's so nice
that is a Lords of X relic storage that
I am going to be used and like this I've
assure you like the way that these are
all kind of recognizes then these little
acrylic storage I think would be really
good for like glitters and single
shadows things like this it's difficult
this is all but some lip liners rate
which I like but realistically will I
ever wear this color no I hate playing
so I think I may actually start going
through my collection that I've kept so
that's the kinda thing I need sort of no
but this is a can we better ah thank
goodness me I don't know I am going to
fucking celebrate fanatically when I
look into the packet
I just leave you to it let me do things
I mean you made you really think this is
what war listen to right now you make
feel built it I'll be dunking the
tablecloth and then when you come up I
set that fish that fly free for
vegetables excuse me

nipple focus you bitch I'm gonna eat us
healthy Oh goodbye hello hit that yeah
