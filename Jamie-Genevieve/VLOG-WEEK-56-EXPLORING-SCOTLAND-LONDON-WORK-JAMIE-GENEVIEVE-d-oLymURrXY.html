last week's vlog has gone up less freely
within the last 10 minutes me and Jay
have been up being Q the Cybermen will
hide like a typical British Sunday
afternoon went to B&amp;amp;Q TK Maxx and home
base but we got a barbecue I just set up
because you should film the way that you
set it up because you've warned the
whole way through and then integral a
bill there typical British pair similar
sports brand a baggy dress on weight
today is supposed to be the last day of
the sunshine for the foreseeable future
so we've got the barbecue Auden and
we're gonna have done it outside with
some beers
Dave quid this is our first barbecue now
yeah only from Long Beach first barbecue
I'm off together yeah okay well not sure
if I put enough call any and it's not
raining it's not boning me across maybe
we may just have to leave it for where
I've not done this in so long so I can't
remember it does seem to be hot enough
I don't know who those into the area it
was the most of the British Navy oh yeah
I thought he was a comedian oh I can
smell it cooking that's great Oh Jack a
barbecue
I was quite intuitive enough stuffy that
thought seems to be went smoothly so far
you first one of them the me chipolatas
you're being too rough for them look
that's cooked in the middle order they
eat him rotate all need to rotate oh
look it's cooked - I made a bit have
been burnt on it I'm really hungry I
want my dinner tonight put that in the
middle no put that one in the middle
then it won't carry I think I made up
for the one too early I said that I said
that it just said wait wait a minute no
I say it's yeah you need to know you to
wait 20 minutes after that's turned
right yeah no this is a nightmare it's
not right now for what you see
well they're not they're burnt nothing
hot born you only take about eight to
ten minutes - great
put that one in the middle for a bit to
at least match it it's pals
rather it's too hot I'm not going on by
Jack why explain that to me you don't
hold on right yeah Lee goes no it's not
fair looking to be a bit more successful
no I've got the sausages around the
outside I'm a got the onion in the
middle C to be fear be clear what to be
fair it's not that much of a travesty I
was not knowing how to barbecue because
we never get a chance in Scotland anyway
so
I got the other in the end no he didn't
what the fuck is this
that's a cuckoo sausage I'm actually
just sitting watch Jack ruin my donor
who way tonight you don't you thought
you threw out let's just leave them do
your thing with the onions just put it
back on the Fang put it on nod I got it
in the end
yeah it does the actually it's really
good but they do look good the taste
test
eggnog budging with an a good job hmm
you go buddy
set a metaphor for good boy
you got horse the taste test have a bait
good but I do a good job good point
Haney super excite ed D right skip
today me and Jack are heading on an
excursion first up is silver Brown for
the job you'll see I'll probably be up
for this week's vlog actually I am going
drugstore makeup shopping and I'm going
to look for you guys but we are going
there and then we are heading over to
the devil's Polpette we don't have a dog
with us because the walk it sails to get
there a treacherous it's a nice day
again 21 degrees I don't know what's
gonna happen when that's where there
goes I'm gonna be cold again
they both come - can i dead end sort of
speak as a fence and it's locked so
we're gonna have to jump at why is it
what it doesn't look as I just supposed
to be in here
there's the same father we are no wheel
off the beaten track like Indiana Jones
and here I feel like even more like in
there I know the path is quite
treacherous yeah it's well trodden or
looks tougher but a lot of people
walking about heal them ah yeah it's a
tourist attraction but it's not to this
spot yeah but I don't think it's not
very well-known I do I think how did we
get across this but just jump at glan
man problems I think that's obvious look
at you what you're reading denim shorts
in a chic little t-shirt I think it's
that we got going they are but I am
through sort of okay this Bob why it
doesn't feel safe
well been walking for about five minutes
and we can heal the water basically the
devil's pulpit a most part is real names
what fennec Glen it's like a hundred
foot or so gorge oh well you know you've
been here before the end you've been
here before like I knew there was a bug
we're gonna have to jump that fence it's
not a jump look look I've taken the path
I've taken the barbed wire don't I know
you crawling through that just step over
the fence when you go out some window
and looking down that abajo fennec Glen
there's a gold chair detail um and I've
got the knee in the devil's pulpit
because I think that there's a rock
formation ship like a Polpette but
because there's a water that runs
through it and it's already rock I think
that the water runs red sort of the
olden days they clustered a devil's papa
let's look so dodgy Ilocos deep back
cliff s just don't fall over
wow that's so steep yeah well there's a
hole in that fence so people are
obviously coming through there what okay
me over that side hi a good point do you
want to walk around father I don't know
ya know but how do we get there we can
see a couple of people or cross the
guards just show a cross and see how do
you get there what are you going
it's like the flippin well watch project
over here this looks promising
deeper under the jungle geez look at her
because I can you can do mean for me I
think this is part the gay dude was
talking about seeing it was really steep
it wasn't actually like a proper path
yep correct good cardio careful
yeah funny cool one wrong finger how
about far straight so that if you come
flying behind me I can stop you okay I
see that says wait you want to take that
better do you want to go under this
fence you're tumbling zyv good good good
I point them just let them do the work
look at that look at this yeah that does
the Eagle and Eagle Marathon

that wire here in the wire is good I
just got a nice booty shop and then
