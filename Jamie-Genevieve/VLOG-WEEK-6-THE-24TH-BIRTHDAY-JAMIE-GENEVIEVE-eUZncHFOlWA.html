hide your thoughts for my alien race
making shoes what's going on so I'm
Chris flesh father's happy birthday to
you happy birthday to you happy birthday
I'm fine
I had this kid chosen Gruyere sometimes
like four years old and my favorite hey
you're welcome
sec is making mum predictors from a
birthday lunch four hours ago
we're having some french toast and bacon
and mrs. Phillips because he remembered
it's my favorite breakfast and yet
looking good pancakes your good birthday
there are makeup just my usual I just
wanted to feel completely I'm wearing my
little white jumper from white fox and
some American Apparel jeans don't shoot
it religious trainers but yeah this is
my birthday face and yak minima Daisy
high key black seeds mmm mmm pretty cool
huh
and then we're going to head enter code
just a little Legrand Schultz I never do
that so I wants to do that from a rough
day and then I want to come home oh I
gotta get here at about three o'clock
and then we're just chilling to the
roasted in which looks nasty have a
steak dinner
I just like to tell you what my birthday
I don't like it no big deal you know me
and Jack just went into town and we're
back and I changed my jumper come
tomorrow and
that atmospheric photos and I bought
some stuff on blue yeah so I got a
little cactus we don't think needs a
real until jerk and peels of hands or
another takes a guy on a thief when
detectives it's such a nice when it's
not going to bake them sale and our two
cups these are made for Wayne which
means I'm really going to have to search
and can rank so don't drink wine that
much I'm probably just going to drink
squanders just sometimes I think back
whatever really nice it was a little
leaf and I go up there which is like a
shell but it is elaborate soil cheap
wood and that metal stick and a shell
I'm going to put my cacti off of it
simple as that look at that
you
like you have to decide of a chemical
choice and also mom and dad got me as
tables for her birthdays with I love it
okay I agree so it's not a good table
and we've got some nice wine that's a
nice question very bossy
Thanks it's all yours my birthday
where's it going so mom dad no the
capital cakes my favorite so they
brought me a little many ones and then
Jack Elvis's up a big one so I good I
guess I pushed ourselves
mom dad just like we had so much fun
what was the game ever played Savage
Jack bought that specs heart attack for
the PlayStation and basically you say
not on your phone and you play the game
and it was really fun anyway if you know
what it is then you know what you do
then yeah we had a really nice time that
I was amazed I know I'm such a good cook
she'll was what is that it's not going
to be nice and it's always me and so I
had a really lovely meal we had some
drinks you're drinking blue dog beer and
asking which is my favorite drink
it's like 4% it's like fuzzy juice but
it's so lovely and it's martini asked
that you should try it if he's not
trying it before I had the recency I
would see it as our Elio that it's funny
because when you're younger it's all
about phasers it's all about 40 gear on
your birthday it's so strange how it
changes as you can although because
today I was just so grateful for
everything I'm grateful for all the
stuff that's happened this year I was
thinking back to my broccoli last year
will mean Jack and my pen instead for
that I will think of him what has
happened how much of experience how much
Jack me and Jack experience together
it's a really nice feeling for your
buddy to just be another deed but maybe
I D to think about how grateful you are
for the whole year is similar to
Christmas right like I'm just so happy
for everything of gore and my amazing
that popper and Jack and las pilas and
