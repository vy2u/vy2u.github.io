just said they ruined it you wait I get
it now a new watch hi guys welcome back
to my channel thank you so much for
joining me again this week I know I was
bad last week and I had a week off for
London sec which was naughty but I'm
back now
hey I'm actually moving into my new
flats model so this is the last you'll
see all this what kind of battery enjoy
:
so I'm working on it and today we are
going to go over that I look here I
totally based on the really crispy
my eyes are Caroline sides also I love
how open and airy sighs look really fake
and Dal Lake and it's circle for night
you saw those prawns birthdays forever
and but it's actually really easy to
create and it's a little bit different
than your usual smokey eye so we'll go
through that today also if you have been
reading my blog sass boom you'll see
that I am doing a humungous giveaway and
you can enter that on Instagram you can
follow me on Instagram which image edit

stands for beauty and the governor's my
save a was going to so far thank you so
much everybody for getting involved and
its own with who's been beaten song calm
I love you thanks so much and I'll be
back next week with another video yet
stay tuned if you want to learn how to
do this like oh just don't enough with
soft ochre by Mike as usual and I'm just
buffing that all over the lids as P
roly's if anyone knows a good eye primer
tell me what it is because I want to try
a new one I am bored just a light even
layer and I always go under the lower
lash line as well then I'm going in with
the Vegas lights palette by makeup geek
which is currently my favorite palette I
think it's absolutely beautiful the
colors are stunning and the shadows
themselves are like butter so I'm going
and wear a color
called desert sands and I'm using that
and the keys but instead of going round
the crease like you naturally Road I'm
gonna buff that pretty much tree inside
though so this is what's gonna give it
that really weight open look and it does
is I better change up for me and I
absolutely love it I think it's a great
look and then as usual I'm just gonna
use that color underneath the lower lash
line as well going in with the color
Mirage which is a beautiful kind of
highlighting and light color as well but
the coverage is beautiful is really
really brightening so it's perfect for a
tree and that can a cut crease effect
almost so just use that on the blade
board and a music and they can I enter
corner / Laurel but now I'm taking a
tiny little brush from makeup addiction
cosmetics and I'm going on with a color
badda-bing and I'm using their as my
crease color so that's the darkest color
that I'm gonna be using today and I'm
just gonna accentuate in the crease
making it really really dark and I'm
going back and forward into the product
all the time making sure that the color
itself is really built up and I'm just
gonna blend and upwards as a ball and
then under the I'm gonna use the double
blue pin so these are my favorite
pencils right now and this color is
coffee and I'm going in the waterline
and then I'm gonna drag that underneath
the lash line of the lower lid Worland
Laura lash and then I'm gonna pull back
and with a pencil brush and the color it
by the binding from the palette just to
smoke that out the pencil is a really
fab base for the eyeshadow then we'll go
back and we're actually not back have
not used it yet the color rule 8 which
is a really beautiful warm kind of brown
and I'm just going to use that to
diffuse the dark brown into the Cana
white blown constantly planes in the
brushes I'm using mostly ours aviva from
the lux set which are absolutely
beautiful
they make my favorite Lane Arella
mascara Jill and this is our littles
we've are laying a brush but just 5
pounds 95 I might add I don't love it
and I'm just
started not right and then I I'm
starting halfway along and then I'm
gonna do a nice big flakes cuz as I said
that's like as quite crispy gonna
audience it aids and she loves Affleck
but that's kind of look making sure the
color is really intense and pigmented
courting of mascara I'm just using
mascara by Illamasqua and he's black
mascara and then I'm gonna go back in
with the color by the bench from the
palette and just smoke the laying it up
a little bit then I'm going in with ill
to order false eyelashes and b19 for get
that glue tacky and however what we you
want to I went to have fun pop those
lashes on I like using a matter
underneath it my eyes so I can see that
they put in place in the latch and that
is the finished eye look
to predefined countries with a little
twist
and I I'm absolutely loving this power
and that's just one way to where this
pilot there's so many different ways
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you next time excuse the beer
Neil's and all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
