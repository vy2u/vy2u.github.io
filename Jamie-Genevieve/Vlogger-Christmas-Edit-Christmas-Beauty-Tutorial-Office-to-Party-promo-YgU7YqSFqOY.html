Genevieve and today I will show you who
together the less it look from late can
I offer the Christmas glam so I'm going
to use all products from Manchester our
deal I've got them all selectors here at
waiting to be used if you'd like to see
how I created best look
stay tuned for this tutorial and I have
picked 10 products well it's act a
little bit more than that now you've
caused that fight something to hurt
loved so I had to have it I got the next
one sure palette your star foundation
something resist my two little bits from
Chanel everybody's a little bit shield
early shortly I go there eliminating
pounds are and I got the Rouge velvet
lipstick and 151 which is what I'm
reading right now this is the thing that
I didn't actually pay Island penguins
had on site here and I was there cheeky
and I just picked up a windy night you
know how can I use this please go
feeling younger skin antenna and I've
got the vitamin C body short moisturizer
to sort out your skin after board of the
winter I've caught the do your brows
they like trial and out to say it's free
from due to speed so they were going to
do the party looks cool I'm going to
start off with some weights ever going
to take my face off
so all you would need is a white and
looks you're gonna just start by taking
this off all this hard work making paste
you may need a few weights for this what
is a job in itself we're gonna start off
with the Dior show Bruce Feiler so this
is just a road pencil and another faders
for stability so you can sort your flows
out first and I'm just been it there's
some strokes through there I'm quite
lucky I've got quite bushy brows and I
can kind of tweeze them into a sheet but
if you doing you can use that so can
every cleat your great shape so I'm
going to start now the key to this is
not 20 if it's too defined when you
start because what you can do as you can
bordering the parameter of the brailers
concealer and that can you really
sharpen things up so I'm gonna do that
first I'm gonna do other sides so I'm
just going to kind of use this little
pencil to fill in my bald patch and then
continue just to get the sheep makes a
neat and then what you can do to prepare
flick their brush around and use the
spoolie just looking according to make
sure you're getting a nice neat sheet
Leslie really glad for just know they're
okay what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
go in with some concealer and I'm gonna
go around the perimeter what they
conceal I saw it will start on the next
row we're gonna put the concealer brush
up underneath as well
and when you use can I say to that angle
brush like that you can get a nice year
looking through the rebounded race or
other side we're just gonna check the
merits eagerly even and then you can
adjust accordingly
I'm just gonna connect stay in the tail
or by go
hey folks great leaders leader I'm just
going to use a lot with your fiber to
buff out a concealer around the eyebrows
and then I'm just going to Napoleon
wrote the Saints as well so using a
concealer to actually you would see if
we don't when you're a really too dark
we don't need to use great product with
your vibration will actually just do the
concealer trick great round them and
then that kind of defines them for you
perfect I'm going to use a tiny little
bit this concealer at model for my legs
just to can I get rid of any kind
disability shown and give it a bit of a
beast it was almost like a blank canvas
for any eyeshadow so the look I'm doing
today is a wee bit more natural on eyes
so what I'm gonna do is grab the next
contour color people say that you can
use these on your eyes or any videos you
take silicon is going to use this one
here and when you use a lot of us just
kind of soften and into the crease as
well and as you've seen there before
you'll see them when I search use and
obviously but it's kinda nice have more
if I kind of wonky canvas underneath
just so you can be
before to go any further with the eyes
liberals wouldn't play my skin though so
I'm gonna take my two products of choice
I'm gonna choose the vitamin C Body Shop
Boys razor and winning is a little bit
of the feelin younger from watch old
favorite of mine from when I used to
work there gonna do a little mixing them
together but much it goes back to my
hands I'm gonna give it a little mix
together I'm just going to use that all
over smells amazing
it's good to do this just I can a couple
minutes before you apply anything a face
powder or foundation anything like that
just so it can affect sensitive skin a
little bit more so once I come in summer
skin in winter I look like I am moving
so that case I'm kind of quite nicely
though because it feels a little bit
sticky when it starts to sink and you
can kind of leave that I'm just going to
speed up after myself I'm going to use
this color here it's kind like a cool
brown as soon as I would really expand
appeal corner I'm going to use that just
I'll end the socket line of my eyes that
Sunnis let's get some mascara on I'm
just going to use the long I'm just
gonna get my eyelashes a little court
that's not too much because the lashes
member I said I was going to use the
ideal whisper ease they are a little bit
later she can use too much mascara and
then underneath so these are all
actually I was talking about these are
there are nails demi whispies and get
these from super dark hair and boobs
actually the reason I'm not going anyway
no it's because you can get away with
more later releasing the lashes probably
all and I'm not gonna do to figure
Italian this same because I only have
two hands
tweezers and I'm just gonna chill like
this for a little bit genuinely so the
key is for these you know I put them on
when their weight because you will have
half so try get them on your eyeball but
a little I've made cups of coffee and
the type that takes so how are you
ya know this is where this is the one
that's blue and energized we are so much
better it comes that's good to go
especially gonna just call battery onto
my lash late start from their corner
so what you can do is well you can get
these a little cool mascara just to kind
of make them blend in with your own
eyelashes and then it looks like you
were born blase and fine lashes let's do
the skin I'm gonna have to start off a
little bit concealer first this is a
really space my main effect and I'm just
going to use a little bit of extra
that's on when you're applying it does
look like a feature to start off with
but when you've got your peanut
Foundation stuff on top is absolutely
fine I just add a real brightness under
the eyes watching for that you can use
that stuff I'm gonna use adjusted back
in a concerning areas in my face just
like an upright and these areas are I've
got eyes and finished for the moment you
never know or I may go back and watch oh
god I'm gonna star or in its skin I'm
gonna go in with the Dior star
transition and fragra boots so this
color is 0:23
and I'm gonna use a scan all over my
skin believing I that's the area
underneath my skin when you use it makes
it something else for that area I'm
going to use the Arbenz candy and
I'm just gonna mix that with the photos
us as a couple issues later I'm going to
mix that with a foundation and then I'm
just going to add that coverage and key
points in my face really one with the
same
I'm gonna mix them together
I'm going to go on the chat No
and this is what's gonna add that can
only be lost again in a pantsuit he's
getting sufficiently covered up everyone
want to do is bootable windy but the
next pile and what are you use it before
it's made for it's gonna cost you to
produce and things like that we're gonna
start off and we're gonna start off with
this when I said I was gonna be good for
clear sky no I don't want to see that
I've got pale skin because that's
depressing and I'm gonna go in with that
color but just I've been a soft and
angle brush and I'm going to use that
just cannot chisel out my cheekbones or
black hole that's why we're doing this
same thing about others I think
everyone's about that stupid face to do
when they're trying to cross
okay what I'm gonna do now is would go
ahead with the slightly warmer shade so
suspended Hill groans me up a little bit
and there is another such a heavy cotton
tourism pause I move it then it seems I
guys before I'm just gonna kind of type
the quarterback okay
it's a game changer I'm just going to
say
analysts didn't I just kind of say
everything under there so when you go in
with a new it forward
this is they can't sleep fridge it's a
limit encoder from Chanel and infinitely
more far as I can have translucent e
codes are we looking a picture in there
toward solution to get a little bit that
and what it does there and the places
that tend to get oily I Center the
cheeks lobe on the chair a little bit
just on the forehead is blue but I
didn't plan on using this at all but
they gave me this to use the matter here
in Manchester on teal and Luke it's puts
three highlighters in it no one told me
about that either
so I'm going to use this version is now
in a slightly lighter shades
a little bit 112 with my usual highlight
before Dominica nails and wouldn't
finish off the leprous a thing that's
missing right now in gone eight years so
it's like just up here at classic Marv
trades it's beautiful so I'm going to
use this brush from the billet and then
I'm going to go in with a light brush
just gonna need update let age for
musical use my little chenille compact
for this
I'm not too worried about the light
green yet because I did I left there
Philipp ruch you have a stupid you
simply can we you take your team and
good luck click on it okay let's do this
with a lip brush so we're gonna use the
lip brush to get their lemonade and I
adore my electable
to go out practice getting a straight
right this is mistake I will show you
how to fix it just happens to be able to
take so when you make a mistake like
that all you do is you get your low
angle brush from going arranger plays
