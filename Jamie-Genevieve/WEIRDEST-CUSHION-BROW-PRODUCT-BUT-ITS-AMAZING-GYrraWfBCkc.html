it's another exciting video and I say
that every time but maybe I'm just an
excitable person so iconic London got in
touch with me a little while ago and
they told me that they were bringing out
a new product and if I wanted to work
with them on it and I said let's see the
product show me the product and then and
then we'll talk I don't know if you guys
watch my vlogs but I recently war ii
broke product all day so i put it on in
the morning I went to my personal
training session which is an hour long
and I sweat a lot and I was doing loads
of stuff that day at nighttime it hadn't
moved at all so I was I got back in
touch with something I was like oh my
god I love this product I'm gonna show
you it I never gonna think it's crazy
because it is it's it looks like one of
those gimmicks but you don't understand
it something same night so it comes like
this here's the little box it says
iconic on it you open it up and it comes
like this so you can see there's like a
little I don't know like a little can
app folded over like lint and there's a
little brush so I'll show you the brush
it's like this so it's got a little
angle brush here a little runny spillage
here and it folds just like this so you
can put it in the case I personally
don't use the old brushes like this when
they come with project just because I
like what I use and I'm used to it but
you can see it's got a motor in there
and then when you open this up you see
it's in connect two parts so there's a
kind of warmer site and there's a darker
side so you can mix your tones this is
the shade deep it's called the sculpt
and boost eyebrow cushion I'm so excited
to show you as honestly it's probably
the easiest quickest most defined
eyebrow I can get it without carving the
mode so I've done my whole makeup
already I've had this makeup on all day
I put I did it really early this morning
and then I sat down to film this video
here's the Q show I'm gonna put my nail
in it so you can see how juicy it is
it's a pro for a pigmented I'll show you
my finger as well like what it's crazy
yeah I'm gonna show you how I created my
eye
using this product so I'm gonna grab my
usual blow brush I'm just gonna run my
spoolie through so this is my natural
brow with no product in it at all this
is just what they look like I'm really
lucky I've been growing them out and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sell them
and the way I've been doing it so
obviously this comes in two parts
honestly I just go in here and in here
so I just get a little bit of both
colors and the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a lane then
the front of my brain oh I like to bring
my brows quite far down here because it
makes my arch look higher so that's
product as really liquidy which makes it
sound like it would be difficult to use
but it's the total opposite it means
that as soon as you apply it you get a
little bit of time to move it around
it's not too pigmented that you can make
a total mess but it's pigmented enough
that you can obviously see it so the
shoe that I'm using is the shade deep
just because I have quite dark roots so
I want that to match and I'm just
building up the lower part of my brow
and then I'm using my brush on its side
just to get a nice light feed and then
I'm gonna use a spoolie just to brush up
so you can see already you're starting
to get more depth now I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna
start sketching out the arch and again
I'm just gonna use my ability to brush
through now I'm going to go through the
brow and the tail this to me cut a nice
solid color and I'm just filling in the
bulk of my dry I like to elongate my
brow just slightly just to give it more
length and then what you can do is once
you've got your in shape you can start
to overdraw your brows lightly so just
like you would overdraw your lips you
can kind of bring your arch up a little
bit higher I think what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to meet my arch slightly
darker and I'm just gonna bring this
dark color a little bit further down
right through my bro starts now I'm just
going to tidy up
my art underneath what you can do and
what it's probably intended if you use
the dark color to create the stencil of
the Grove and then sell in using the
warm that gate can it creates that nice
3d I like just mixing the two close
together because I do have quite a lot
of here and I don't really need the kind
of 3d look so that is the defense and my
eyebrows you can see that this one
obviously is a lot more natural totally
fine if that's your look but I prefer a
kind of more solid structured bro I
think that there spreads giving my eye
more or less I don't think it looks a
little bit more dramatic which suits me
just fine now I assume though you can
kind of see the display it does look
obviously a lot more structured I
absolutely love the way that this
product looks so the way that it goes
over and I'll show you on my hands the
way the product goes on is like aware
that you can see and I remember when I
first got the pr package the first thing
I did was open it up and then I did this
I'll put it in the back of my hand to
see what the formula was like I don't
know gonna lie at first I thought it was
quite weird and then I put it on
obviously that's pretty late you can go
back here mr. dark and go back over it
but what I did was I waited for it to
dry which is gonna take a little while
you get some please tell us it
definitely and then I waited for it's
dry and I remember I just ran my fingers
over that like that's really really hard
and it didn't move at all so the next
day that's when I did my brows I had no
makeup on that day apart from mascara
and eyebrows so when I had no foundation
on and stuff like that I still really
like to lick all that I went and I did
my whole day I really put the product to
the taste I've ensured it was week
number 23 it was we know it was last
week so it was week number 23 in the
vlogs if you want to go and check that I
put it to the test
I wore the pros all day I went to the
gem everything and they did not move at
all
I couldn't believe it all day likely
minded my trainer said elliptically as
well she was like oh my god you're not
very sleek incredible I was like I know
yeah I put it to the test in the nuts
when I got back in touch with a chronic
London and I was like yes that bloke
products in seen so good and it's funny
because it is a total
it's one it is one of the thing it's
gonna go right or than Instagram because
it's weird right it's a weird package
but it's great this is money savings bro
saying I have been reading it every
single day sense of order and I get
excited with your memories because I
know they're gonna end up like this also
I should mention when you first
initially take that off it comes with
one of these little things on top so you
won't get dried out one basically but
when you're using that you to make sure
to shut this and then shut this so it
doesn't dry up I'll show you the
difference between deep and medium this
is deep here and in that medium above it
so you can see that I can I have a
slight difference in tone if I do this
you can see that it's made up the same
way you would darken one color and then
a bit later another site it's quite nice
as well because one colors ashy and the
other one is warm so you can kind of
custom blend to your own hair type there
is one more color and it's light and I
don't have it because I got really
excited about it let's probe droids eyes
I knew that I would never use the lay
color so I gave it I gave it we give it
to friends I don't have that to show you
but there's tons of images online or
that one seal or an iconic website when
the first which is Wednesday the day
after Halloween what I'm gonna do now is
I'm going to do this eyebrow and I'm
going to do it on camera a little bit
further away so you can definitely see
everything and I'm just going to speed
it up just so you can see how easy it is
to create a perfect bride with this
product
which is good for a Dre's don't lie so
that you guys as both my eyebrows
finished absolutely I'm not get
it so that is my tutorial and review on
the new sculpt and boost eyebrow kitchen
once iconic reached out and asked me to
work with him on this as soon as I tried
that I was so excited cause obviously
you guys I would never recommend
anything that I do not like so that's
why I like to try these things out
before I agree to work with anybody and
as soon as I try that I was so excited
to show you guys when I was just
applying my second buy another thing
that I kind of realized I like away the
product is the fact that it's a liquid
so you don't get any crazy buildup and
your brow hairs I remember there's some
kind of pomades and jails that I use
that make my brows really chunky and
sometimes the product gets clogged up
and my brow hairs and things like that
you do not get that with this product
the product itself is vegan friendly and
like I said it will be available from
the 1st of November so I hope you guys
like my little review on this product I
was really excited to show you and other
than that I will see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
