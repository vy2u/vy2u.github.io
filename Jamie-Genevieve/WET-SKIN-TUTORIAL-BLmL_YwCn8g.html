I am going to show you this entire look
basically focusing on their school that
I've got on to be honest that's pretty
much what the school tutorial is about
it's just to show you how to get super
healthy glowing skin and whatever
basically and I'm going to try a new
product which is new to me from this
week which I love so if you'd like to
see how to highlight like a champ
stitchin why this does it so first I'm
going to do it as week maryska not
survey the skin pure clay cream I have
been using this for a long time you need
or me know here's me talk a bit already
it I just love it it's really refresh
and it's nice and light but it's nice
and hygiene as well so if you've been
using looking like her moisturizer
through the night this works great
yeah absolutely every excuse that like
that I never would sports my change so
weird
my latest a friend Asians get a little
mixture so I've been mixing and born
this way foundation by Too Faced and
shade light beige and then I've had this
foundation for long things this is
medium 54 Lockett foundation by Kat Von
D and by themselves the Born This Way is
great but I find a cat on TV so I go
back to tech for me so when I mean more
coverage or we're not gonna filler
makeup I just mix them on the back of my
hand with my Beauty Blender and it's
like a nice foundation that's still can
I do it but it's like the best coverage
a row and and if those cover and they
said I needed to and then I haven't
tried this mixture with a brush but
Beauty Blender is been my fave not here
when I've never filmed this early before
in my entire life
it's going right over my V eyebrows one
side was the oil or some others in my
I'm gonna bring a lot with them I neck
but that is my si si si si I love it and
what are you guys my maybelline
concealer that I can't pop using you
already know all the main bit make sure
you get under your eyes you change your
nose your forehead and then put people
in that as well and this is just be my
favorite concealer it's nice and cheap
it's just amazing under-eye magic
cookies or something like that so even
though we've got quite a fill on base
it's so easy to get this look like a
nurse or Ghoulies once they can see
there's old I'm going to take my blue
I'm gonna put it all over my eyelid with
my finger really really quick this one's
nice and fresh and new so it's just nice
and easy when you get can a half we
finish you're gonna have to start using
the brush so once the base is on and
we've can a Beauty Blender I like to
defeat blender eyelid make sure
everything is seamless I'm going to use
my fees Kat Von D powder now I'm not
going to be XD I'm not a liar and wire
I'm going to bake so it's good to take a
very very tip and I only want to be
literally like the Creasy bits under my
eyes no more than that
just like that and then I'm going to
take a little bit of a bigger brush and
we're going to go over the lid just a
map by vechs no effort wow I look
completely crazy and I'm going to
actually bronze mask I don't know that I
look we're gonna do it is not heavy by
any means we're gonna it's all this skin
focus today y'all so we're going is my
NARS Laguna bronzer this is clearly
loved by me this is one our favorites
for sure
so I'm just using my bag m-104 brush
from morphe to do like a rough bronze
and then I'm just going to use the one
1/2 brush from Smith just to connect
contour a little bit okay never tall
bronze I'm going to dust away under my
eye
and then I'm going to using in repeal it
today
this is the man-eater palette by Tarte
it's just basically all my favorite
colors in one place and very happy that
it's all the same so I'm going to use
this today I'm going to go all over it
with the color passion just here and
then I'm going to go in with Parv and
the crease and a little bit saucy oh
baby foods Jesse I'm sorry there's no
passion all over it's already kind of
matte anyway what would mr. shade purse
we're keeping it really really late I'm
just using this transition shade just so
we get a lot of that dimension to my
eyes I don't want them with nothing on
them otherwise that's how my eyes can
end up looking create small I'm just
using it just to create depth in this
object and then we change over to my
brush I'm going to use a little semester
to Sarah is brush first brush was the 2
to 4 by Mac and win-win with you part
again and just under my eye I might
actually go with a little ship X or C
good move and I'm going to wear my teeny
bit I saw see on the top results oh I
love that this is going to be my new
phase palette for traveling for sure
it's got all the colors you need to get
a nice dramatic smoky eye you can use
them nice and light as well it's got a
shimmer in it if you need a spotlight I
or something perfect and I'm like sure
going to leave like that today
- schaible truck and I'm actually I'm
going to go on with a little bit of the
highlight sheet
which is called leaps which is just a
nice back one here I'm just going to use
out on a bread my browbone he's a lot
about that in the inner corner as well
I'm gonna stick my little lashes on so
the lashes I'm using are Lily lashes and
complete they are just really really
pretty I'm going to glue these up get
some mascara and get you stuck on my
eyeball I'm going to use the new mani
type mascara from Tarte as well this aim
I use this yesterday that's crazy good
Amy Josh's so much a second longer once
and it's Cairo's or 1 you can see her
Kreuziger that is I don't even need one
flash it to be that warm today once
that's on my lashes should be dry
once you have especially for dry lashes
get on your eyeball grab its salt loaf
at a certain speed and that's it how it
different boroughs yesterday and it
worked really really real so I'm just
going to go back and forward and with my
little silly and the end of my flow ways
till I get froth and then once I have
that I'm just going to go through my
eyebrows as they are right through them
and let's just say some end please but
ultimate somebody really said if you
want I'm walking it index tutorial I
have done a sort great technique one
once they're nice and tidy and employees
they'll start to dry and then that is
when people over it with you can
approach jail so this is the rebel
biomass tub and I think they're just
she'd like chocolate or something I'm
just going to go on top for free foot
assault and that just makes them
decorate but it also makes them full up
here which is my favorite nursing it
almost makes them a little bit darker as
well
now if you have to and you usually can
adorn to be honest but if you have to
fill any parts and you can just use your
pro ways I'm just going to bring them a
little bit further down here and I'm
just using brush strokes just to kind of
thicken that little area up once you've
got your can I make up and your skin
mostly done we're going to actually do
the lips next so I'm going to take dark
naked pin fell by over to here and I'm
just going to lean my lips
okay so once you let your let go on top
I'm going to use nude sticks gel color
lip and cheek bone and Haven I really
like these they are the easiest product
to use you just cut right in lick there
so jail like lip gloss and once they're
really hydrate and it's like at the
perfect nude so you can use these on
your cheeks as well I have the way I
would use it is that we can I put on my
finger start and I just pass on
I'm close with a gel color it's
literally fridge it's really love these
love these and the companies really
close well the nice idea finally it
paints highly what we're going to do is
I'm going to take my aquatic illuminator
so this was given to me a few days ago
now I use it for the first year a couple
days ago and everyone remains so what
you do is in a dropper bottle I'm
actually going to draw some on my hands
maybe like three drops and I'm going to
just apply that we're gonna want it with
my finger first and then we're going to
be Bluebird and
it almost looks like supermodels skin
it's the most shiny wet looking
highlighter I've ever used it makes your
skin look so healthy and then excess I
just wait to walk straight up with a
Beauty Blender and just apply it where I
need it's just craziness stuff I love it
if you're never totally amazed you can
just apply straight from the Beauty
Blender as well and I'm using it right
across my kisses bought and then just a
little touch on my bottom lip and that
just gives it the most glorious again
but obviously you aren't going to keep
certain areas matte to show off the
highlight so I'm going to go end with a
little bit more Kat Von D Pedro and I'm
just going to powder the very center of
my face
and that means you get more shame on you
on your head and that just goes to deem
was healthy beautiful blue skin that
forward correct and then if you are a
working professional makeup artists you
can use this kind of technique or in it
your models you can use on their skin as
well I'm actually just going to show you
what it looks like so I'm going to use a
little dot like is so reflective you can
use it a lot Bickle's a long way so if
you use that just going to say it or
ever models legs or on our shoulders or
something bad it would just look so
beautiful so yeah that is my highlighted
skin so you guys are the finished look I
hope you like that let me know if you
try this product because I think you'll
love it just as much as I do and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
