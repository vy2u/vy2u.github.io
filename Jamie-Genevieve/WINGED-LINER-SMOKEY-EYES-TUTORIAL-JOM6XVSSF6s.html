I'm going to show you how to do this I
look so it's probably one of my favorite
looks it's a big one knifes marks quite
glam quake grunge all those good things
campaign if you'd like to see how I
created this eyelet speech and first I'm
going to do it I'm going to prep my eye
with a lien law pimp pot I will write
that down below people that seem to have
a little bit of a time understanding
what I'm seeing when I see Liam all
laying low and we're just going to apply
that all over the lid where's our any
Brussels good this is the urban decay
don't crease brush no don't concealer
brush and this just gives a super
pigmented clean base to the eye I'm
gonna underneath my eyes out a little
bit zeal for eye shadows today I'm going
to win with my favorite palette so I
just made this palette myself it's a
mixture of makeup geek and Anastasio
Beverly Hills
mostly makeup geek and here is also the
first color we're going to go in with is
beaches and clean just here and goodly
by this palette you can use whatever
you've got a warm that is similar color
but I like I'll link all the colors that
I use down below if you want to see what
they are and I'm just using my Mac two
to four brush as always just to buff
that all over the cleaner B's to mattify
it this just means that any eyeshadows
we put on top well go on seamlessly the
next color I'm going to go in with is a
faun which is just here that is by
Anastasia Beverly house and we're going
to use this in the crease as the
transition color and I'm just using my
Mac two to four brush for this as well
as always I'm bringing it quite high
here just an inner corner I like a nice
blue night smokey eye and then
I'm going to bring this edge right to
the right of like underneath my grave
right marriage which is a quite photo
I'm going to swap my brush over to the
Weaver two to four just here my favorite
brush will play I'm going one with that
foreign color again and I'm just going
to apply that underneath my eye I'm
going to stick with this brush now and
I'm going to go in with the shade mocha
by makeup geek which is just here is a
really beautiful dark ash bright and I'm
going to use my zero two two for its
apply that in a crease and then I'm
going to go back in with my two to four
and the first base color and just soften
that at the braid now I'm going to go in
with my morphe 8:42 brush and this color
again beaches and cream and I'm just
going to mattify the whole lid and let's
kind of break this up as well and then
because it's so pigmented I just used my
Mac two to four to diffuse the edges and
then quite often I go back in with a
dark road and just start and actually
stuff again liner trailing I'm going to
win with my Kat Von D triple I know this
is my favorite interval time and I'm
gonna win this eyeball it so the way
I've done is quite straight it's not
crazy and big but it's still pretty cool
just leaned into my shine throughout my
face
great flips and brilliant once you've
got your later on
add some lashes these are the monocle it
lashes by Lily lashes that I'm going to
use today I'm going to trim them it's
how about here and then pop them on just
now why don't wait for that last to dry
I'm going to go in with the shade marker
again with my is Weaver two to four and
I'm just going to buff that underneath
my eye for a little bit adjective and
now bring that shadow right up to meet
wing and that's the finished look it's
not I'm going with an inner corner
crazy girl last thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to take this shade here it's
pink champagne by anastasiya with my
Smith - five six brush and we're just
going to highlight that inner corner so
guys the finished look I hope you liked
it if you are wondering what I use today
