happy YouTube dear I thoroughly enjoy
YouTube the I get excited the Buddha I
hope you get excited about it
hey guys welcome back to my channel
another week another tutorial and this
week is going to be on when lay no I
think if I started doing makeup I muscle
deaths a million times so I thought why
not do one for you guys so the way I've
done it as it was super easy we feel
free to do it the way I did even if you
just take a little bit of advice from me
that's great you don't need to do the
fill thing so this is a really good way
to do it if you want them super neat
super straight feel free to use the tape
or doing you don't need to use this here
but I personally do like it because it
makes it really easy to make sure that
they are symmetric are the same cause
sometimes this doesn't make you look
completely earlier if ones up here ones
down here you do look like you're
confused about life in general not just
your eyeliner so the tape helps to make
sure it's nice and even and you look
seen well I have your attention I would
like to talk to you a little bit about
sass bomb it's ass bomb is a blog that I
am starting I've already written loads
of posts for light so it's going to
cover everything like makeup your beauty
I'm going to be doing a little bit of
vanity DIY as well because there's
nothing better and if you're enter your
makeup and having like the best
Vanny section dratini wake up in the
morning and you may or may not know that
I actually bought my first flat so I'm
moving in first of me and after that
I'll be doing a little bit a lifestyle
on my blog as well so just making my
inner house until home and the way I'm
going to change things up and stuff and
I've already got great ideas for
my furniture and I do have a few be DIY
but it's that I'm really excited to do
I've wanted more at home since I was
like 17 so I only got it last week it
was the day after YouTube D last week so
I am so excited I cannot wait there is
the perfect area you've ever imagined in
your life for all my makeup stuff and I
just cannot wait to transform it and I
think what I would like to do is share
that with you guys so you can go and
look at my blog just know there's
nothing on it but you can subscribe on

the Google followers thing I'll link

but I am super excited about it because
reading blogs is one of my favorite
things to do I have to love hearing
people have to see about different
products and brands and I love just
getting an inspiration especially for
like my flyer and stuff so you can check
that out there and you can look forward
to a huge giveaway huge I wish I wasn't

I hope you like this one and I'll be
back next week with another one for you
okay bye starting off with soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac and a concealer brush
by makeup addiction cosmetics I'm going
to paint my full loads with the primer
going right up to the brow and use my
finger just to blend it and I'll be bit
further then when I'm with my hourglass
palette this is the modernist palette
and I am going to use the lightest shade
only and just use their with my zoeva
soft definer brush all over the lids and
then you place your tape underneath the
lower lash line extending out towards
the brow
grinning with Ella masca Infiniti GLA
now we start at the metal of the LEDs
and draw a line extending out and then
this is when you choose how long you
want your flight to be so the tapes are
going to help you get your straight line
all you have to do is decide how far out
you want to go excuse the letter in this
video it had a life of its own then you
draw back towards the lid and notice the
brush changes direction with the
direction that I'm painting so you draw
it down towards the sensitive the eye
and then you extend it and open your eye
up pay somebody to get in your inner
corner then once you have kind of joined
the fill line up just use the brush with
more close-up backwards and forwards
until it's solid black and nice and
smooth no creases or anything the brush
I'm using is makeup addiction Cosmetics
angled liner brush I really like a brush
like this for it makes em precise
and then you get to take your tape off
the most satisfying thing in the world
and then you get left with a really nice
perfect Lane going back in with my
concealer brush I'm just going to blend
out your foundation if anything's been
removed with the tape using next jumbo
pencil in milk I just paint my waterline
white and then apply a generous coat of
mascara to the top and bottom lashes
this just makes the eyes look nice and
do light then pop on your lash let the
glue get nice and tacky before you place
it on just to make sure it stays all day
and then go over the lash with some gel
liner just to make sure it's super black
and that is the flick finished really
nice natural flick look for daytime if
you want to use it for nighttime just go
bigger I hope you liked this video guys
and I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
