it's hi everyone welcome to my channel I
am that's what happens when you have no
idea what to see hey today I'm going to
do a smokey eye I'm gonna start off by
prepping the lids using Mac paint and
bare canvas or an all over the lid and
going underneath as well going on with
my vapor eyeshadow by Illamasqua I'm
gonna blend this with my blending brush
up into the crease and then I realized I
forgot to put the tape on yeah there we
go got the masking tape you can use any
kind of tape for this I like this
because it peels off fairly easily and
they're just gonna help get a really
nice clean edge see very shadow
so cleansing the ong eyeshadow right up
my keys until you concealer under my
braids using the gel liner by Illamasqua
I'm gonna go in all over the lower lids
so that's because it's quite clearly
what things are playing it going on with
my blending brush and my black shadow
opposite in by Illamasqua
I'm gonna buff that and I love that
blending time we're just trying to get a
nice fade between the black eyeshadow on
the orange eyeshadow when I'm with my
blending brush again just gonna buff
that more the orange eyeshadow is gonna
really help with your blends in here
because it's nice and warm compared to
the black and I'm going in with my gel
liner again and I'm just gonna go in my
waterline taking off the masking tape
I'm gonna go and with my obsidian shadow
and a smaller brush and just go right
underneath and with some mascara
sure everyone just best face when
they're doing the skaters will
attractive pop it on my daughter false
lashes I'll put the name of them below
little better the washdown staring and
just popping them to finish off the week
a little last-minute blends and that
should done the easiest smokey ID the
tape gives you a nice sharp line and
it's an succeed
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
