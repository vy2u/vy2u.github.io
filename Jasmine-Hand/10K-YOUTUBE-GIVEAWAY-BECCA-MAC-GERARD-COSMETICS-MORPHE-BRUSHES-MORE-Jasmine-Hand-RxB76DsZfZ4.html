so as the title says this video is for
my 10k YouTube giveaway I just wanted to
say thank you guys so so much seriously
from the bottom of my heart I'm so
grateful for all of your comments
support love just everything about my
youtube channel because I seriously did
not think that i would get anywhere near
even a thousand subscribers when i first
started because i am quite shy when it
comes to being in front of the camera
but i was willing to put myself out
there to do something that I love so
yeah I just wanted to give back to you
guys by accumulating some of my favorite
brands and products so I'm just going to
go ahead and get straight into what you
could win so the first thing you could
win is a lipstick carousel and it spins
around on this little spinny thingy and
this is seriously the best thing that's
ever happened to me and my beloved
lipsticks it's so cool I've always
wanted one of these things so I thought
this guy would be really really cool to
add to my giveaway it is from the makeup
box and you on Instagram so yeah this is
one of the things that you could win now
to put it down carefully so before I
forget I am giving away the more fear
350 palette which I'll put a picture up
here I don't actually have it with me
because it hasn't arrived yet but i just
thought i would let you guys know
because you're probably looking at the
picture on Instagram being like bitch
what you haven't tried the palette so
yeah it's still coming but that is still
definitely going to be in my giveaway I
just want to say that before I started
because i knew i would forget so don't
have it in front of me so next up is
this sigma brush cleaner I don't know
how but I ended up with three of these I
don't know if they mixed up my package
or whatever but I did receive a package
from sigma x 3 and this was in their
package those three times so I thought I
didn't need three and I would include
what in my giveaway
I use this every single time I deep plan
my brushes and it's amazing so yeah
that's what I would include this so next
up is some goodies from my favorite tan
it is the loving tan deluxe bronzing
mousse in medium now I decided to pick a
medium because if you're really really
pale the ultra dark one which is what i
use would probably be way way way too
dark but i thought i'd get medium
because it would suit all pale skin type
and even if you are wanting a really
really dark tan you can just build this
up and put two or three codes i've
actually done it before and it works
just fine and it looks really really
dark so also i decided to include the
applicator mitt and the removing um
exfoliating gloves so what takes the
turn off so yeah okay so next up are
some goodies from Pony cosmetics which
is a fellow australian bread so I have
the White Knight mascara the lip gloss
three of their brow powders in these
shades chestnut thoroughbred and
Palomino and also their wax as well and
then they're highlighting a brow bone
pen and then they're contouring brush I
actually love this brush for contouring
my nose it's seriously amazing and
lastly there contour highlight and flush
kit so yeah I thought I would include
some of those goodies because i like
them and i'm sure you guys will too so
next up are some Gerard cosmetics
goodies and as you already know I'm
obsessed with their products so I picked
out the bb+ illumination cream this
stuff is so amazing when you mix it with
your foundation it just leaves your skin
so glowy and fresh so yeah and you also
can use this by itself on top of your
cheekbones if you want for a highlighter
so I picked up two lipsticks the first
sip stick is Rodeo Drive and it's a
satin finished lipstick it's just kind
of similar to 90 95 but not as dry and I
really really like the way this looks on
my skin tone and then I decided to pick
up buttercup personally not a favor
of mine but it is one of the most
popular shades ever on their website so
yeah I thought I would include that one
in there so next up is a becca cosmetics
champagne pop by jaclyn hill um this is
so so hard to get if you're here in
Australia because the only way to get it
from Sephora is from the u.s. sephora
and you need to use like shipping
services to get it here in Australia so
it's super super hard and expensive to
get here so i thought i would include
one of these bad boys in here and lastly
a mac lipstick of your choice excluding
like limited edition because i don't
know if i can even get that so just any
of the like staple colors whichever
color you want i will go out and buy and
send to the winner all you have to do to
enter is repost this photo that i've
inserted right here or you can just head
over to my Instagram which is makeup by
underscore jazz tag me and hashtag
makeup by jazz 10k and then obviously
you have to be subscribed to my youtube
channel and just leave any comment down
below now I will be choosing the winner
from the comment on this video not from
instagram i just thought i would
incorporate instagram into its just
because i have more of a following on
there so more people are aware so yeah
just any comment down below and make
sure you include your Instagram name so
it's just easier for me to contact the
winner so the giveaway will end in 2
weeks from today and i will be posting
the winner on instagrams and make sure
you're following me on there so you can
find out whether you have one or not so
yeah I think that's all I have to say
good luck and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
