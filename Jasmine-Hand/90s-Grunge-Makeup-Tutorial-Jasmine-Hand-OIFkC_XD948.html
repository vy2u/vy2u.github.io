something with my hair no hey guys
welcome back to my channel so in today's
video I did a 90s inspired grunge makeup
tutorial I did film hey get ready with
me a few weeks ago on a look similar to
this but the lighting was really shit
and because my friend was over I was
just talking to her the whole time and I
wasn't showing you guys what I was
actually putting on so I decided to film
a proper makeup tutorial I hope you guys
like it and thank you so much for
watching so I'm just gonna prep my skin
with some Neutrogena hydro boost
absolutely love this stuff it really
hydrates my face and I'm just gonna pop
on some chapstick umm day and night lip
balm I love this as well okay so I'm
going to use some products that I
haven't used before in this video just
so I can try them out and let you guys
know how I feel about them so I'm going
to use this designer brands 24 hour long
wear foundation I view this a few times
and I absolutely love it so the
foundation so the foundation have been
absolutely obsessed with lately is the
designer brands long wear 24 hour
foundation it is incredible especially
for the price it's like 14 dollars or
something and Priceline always has sales
like 30 or 40 percent off so you can
probably grab this foundation for under
$10 which is amazeballs so I'm gonna
buff that in with my new Sigma f80
kabuki brush
and this is in the darkest shade because
I'm pretty I'm freshly fake tan so it
does seem to match my mother's condition
up in my ear that is disgusting
has anyone else done that so I'm just
buffing that in with this brush and just
going down my neck I just love how this
foundation blends and looks on my skin
like for $14 and even though my son
would make a foundation for $14 but this
shit is amazing and then I'm just gonna
go over the top with my damp Beauty
Blender just to make it look even more
flawless I always like to do this when
I'm buffing my foundation in with a
brush I like to go over it all with my
damn Beauty Blender I just think beauty
blenders make everything just look so
flawless so yeah I'm looking at my face
in the UM the flip-out screen and it
looks really dark so hopefully it'll
look okay after I highlight my face so
now I'm gonna conceal my under eye area
with the Maybelline fit me concealer
hopefully this is going to sort of
lighten up my face because it is looking
quite dark
I'm just blending all that in with my
beauty blunder
okay so I recently just received a
package from Velvet 59 and one of the
products they sent me is this cream
contour kit so I was gonna try out the
cream contour shades I'm not really a
fan of cream contouring I think it's
just because I seriously don't know how
to do it so I'm gonna grab a can you
grab this brush so we're gonna grab this
makeup addictions duo fiber stippling
brush and I'm just gonna dab a little
bit of this middle shade just here and
we'll knock my cheeks
oh yeah now I need to go in for the daka
shape I'm gonna go into the darkest
shade
I have a feeling that looks a little bit
too dark I might I'm using the middle
shade now which is like the lighter
color I don't even know what I'm doing
to be honest and putting some under my
jewel so I'm just gonna set my
highlighted areas with this banana shade
from the shade and light palette and
then I'm just gonna go in with my new
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac and use that
to prime my eyelids usually I would just
use a concealer but I bought this the
other day so I may as well use it and
then I'm just gonna set the rest of my
face with the Australis fresh and
flawless powder and it's in the color
darkest brown hopefully this kind of
lightens up the foundation I've never
worn it without mixing because I have
the lightest color of the foundation as
well and I tend to like mix it in but
because my tan is pretty fresh I thought
I wouldn't mix it in I think that's kind
of lightened the foundation a little bit
but see it what I mean like you spent
all that time cream contouring but I'm
just gonna go ahead and set my face with
powder and then powder contour so why
not just powder contour like I don't I
don't get it
so now I'm going to contour with my
hoola bronzer and the brush that came
with it
look
whether that pimple come from can you
say that that's nasty
and then I'm gonna go in with this brush
it's just a Jessup large fluff brush and
contour the sides of my nose I don't
usually go quiet overboard with contour
my nose but I do a little something so
now I'm going to bake my face as per
usual just with my face of Australia
translucent powder and I'm just going to
bake functioning for my contour so I'm
going to brush off my contour because I
don't like to keep it on for too long
otherwise the line just gets way too hot
so the blush I'm going to use this
makeup geek bliss single pan blush
they're really really pigmented it's a
really really nice icarly color I really
like coral blushes so I'm gonna
highlight with my one and only
mary lou lou manizer it's definitely one
of my favorite highlighters I'm going to
use one of my new Sigma brushes I'm
going to use that tapered highlighter
brush
I've got this brush is amazing okay new
favorite highlighter brush photo show it
so first of all I'm gonna go in with
creme brulee from makeup geek into my
crease now going in with my new Mac two
one seven brush which I'm obsessed with
I'm taking bitten from makeup geek and
I'm just running that into my crease and
then I'm going in with Anastasio Beverly
Hills single eyeshadow in caramel and
I'm just like blending all of that
together and then just using any brush
I'm just taking a bitten from makeup
geek and patting that on my whole eyelid
so now I'm gonna grab Peach Smoothie
from makeup geek and just use that to
diffuse the colors at the top so it
doesn't look like a harsh line so now
I'm going to take the Maybelline eye
studio gel eyeliner in black and line my
waterline with this
from inner to outer corner and then I'm
just gonna take a bit of that liner just
below the lash line it can be messy
because we'll be blending that out so
now I'm going through it just take a
smaller tapered blending brush and I'm
gonna take a dark brown eyeshadow I
think I'm gonna take Coco bear from
makeup geek and blend that gel liner
with it so it doesn't look so harsh and
then I'm grabbing it bitten again
so now I'm just taking the Mac of
vanilla pigment and using that as a in a
corner highlighter which looks amazing
I'm just going to spray a bit of fix
plus I'm going to screw up the way too
much super lashes I'm going to use the
House of lashes iconic and I'm just
going to take him on this Megan Elise
lash glue so now I'm just going to go in
with this L'Oreal Paris lip liner in
velvet robe velvet rope
yep
so now I'm going to go in with Anastasia
Beverly Hills trust issues liquid
lipstick
kind of won it like an ombre style lip
so I'm gonna add dusty rose also about
uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
I think $600 worth of makeup no it would
be way more than that because that's
with the discount</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
