hey everyone welcome back to my channel
so in today's video Edison to do a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I've seen heaps of
youtubers do these types of videos and I
found them really really funny so I
decided to do one for myself so I asked
you guys to send me some videos and I
have quite a few here so the first one
is from Brooke M 7 6 7 I hope you can
see it ok um what age they start wearing
makeup probably like I think I was in
grade 12 and I think I was really into
it in grade 11 I don't think so yeah
grade 12 the youtubers I love definitely
Niki tutorial she's definitely one of my
favorites at the moment Shannon so
crispy
desi can't think of any more from the
top of my head but yeah they're
definitely the youtubers that I watch
really frequently I don't actually watch
AFL so oh she's talking about the AC
contour kit personally I don't even you
use the contour shades
I love the highlighters tips to making
it work I don't know have a light hand
yeah probably don't use it and get the
Anastasi one because it's ten times
better but yeah okay I just quit that
because I just seen so many more seconds
it was my inspiration for making YouTube
videos I don't know one day I just kind
of wake up and was like I kind of really
want to watch myself doing my makeup so
I did and then I played around with the
editing and then I decided to upload it
on YouTube for some sick reason and I
got quite a nice response oh let's just
don't give so Britney Saunders has sent
me one so let's see what this bitch is
got to say why are you so ugly oh my god
no mom
my snapchat just died
what
hello yes have I got any suggestions for
acne / pigmentation well I have a quite
acne prone skin I know you can't really
say at the moment but when I don't have
makeup on I have a lot of redness I love
to use the brand called Bo I'm pretty
sure that it is in the Australian brand
but it's done wonders for my skin I
definitely would suggest an electric
cleanser one like this this one's from
vanity planet.com and it's called the
spin for perfect skin
I do have the Clarisonic as well which
was quadrupled the price or even more
and I found that actually broke me out
for some reason but this one did it so
yeah I definitely recommend this one
for acne prone skin so yeah check it out
before is that a brow yeah picture oh
she's in an American that's cool I don't
really know if I could give you advice
because I don't really have that many
subscribers on YouTube like I mainly
just do it for fun so my advice to you
would be to get a decent camera the one
I use is the canon 600d which is amazing
except it doesn't have autofocus which
is pretty but it's alright and
decent lighting if you don't want to
spend money on artificial lighting just
set up in front of a window
I'm obviously with a lot of light coming
through the
otherwise it's pointless what's your
fave makeup product um what do you mean
how am I supposed to answer that what's
my favorite makeup product you can't ask
me that I seriously like can't answer
that I don't have one favorite products
like a car I thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will
see you in my next video bye guys
so all the products that I use today are
all affordable drugstore products or if
you live in Australia you can get them
from Priceline except for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
