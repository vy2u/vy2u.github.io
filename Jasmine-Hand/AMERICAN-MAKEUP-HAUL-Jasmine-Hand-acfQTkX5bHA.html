today's video I decide to film a haul
for you guys and I'm so so so excited
because I received these products a
couple of weeks ago and I haven't had
the time to film until now so I've
hardly touched any of the products to
make them look as new as possible so
basically all the products that I got
are not available here in Australia so I
used a shipping service called shop and
box so basically what you do is you go
on to don't never know meet up shop and
box.com I'll leave the address on the
screen if that was wrong and basically
what you do is you create a wish list
so you add everything to your cart and I
mean everything is available on that
website
everything makeup and really related
they will have on the website so then
you create a wish list so then after
you're finished you submit done or you
submit your wish list and then you have
to wait up to 24 hours for your boxer
which is your personalized boxer that
will go out in the US or wherever they
are and buy all of your items and then
send them to you so then you can just
message your boxer to and fro they'll
update you on when they order the stuff
when they receive the stuff and then
when they ship out the stuff then
they'll ask you to pay for invoice one
which is the total of all the makeup
products together so then you pay that
via PayPal and bullabbai it's all
self-explanatory when you're on the
website and then after that your box up
will then use your money to order the
items online or if she goes out in store
and buys them so after that your boxer
will say I've ordered all your items or
I've got all your items I'm ready to
ship them out to you and then that's
when you pay for invoice 2 which is the
shipping from their address to your
address of law removal and I'm just
gonna let you know how much invoice one
was so I paid two hundred thirteen
dollars and 95 u.s. dollars and then my
invoice to payer was twenty eight
dollars and forty two cents so I guess
you guys are probably wondering how long
it took for the items to go from the
boxes to my address and it took three
business days it was expressed it was
amazing it
so quick I absolutely loved it before I
confused you guys even more the three
day shipping is only when all of the
items are at the boxes house and they
ship it straight to you not the actual
day that you order your items because it
does take a few days for the box to
collect all your items or if she's
shopping online it does take a few days
but I mean it's three days express
shipping from the box's house to your
house so I just want to say that up so
yeah if you're thinking about buying a
gift for someone for Christmas it'll
definitely arrive if you order within
the next week because of the three days
shipping so shopping box were nice
enough to give me a coupon code to share
with you guys so it is 10% off for the
first 50 shoppers that spend above 150
US dollars invoice once so the card will
be written on the screen but it's a huge
as50 so yeah I think that's enough
information for now and I'm just gonna
get straight on to what I picked up okay
so these first products I picked up is
the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette I have these first one and I'm
obsessed with it so I thought I would
pick up this one this one you can get
here in Australia actually just from
Mecca but I just thought while I was
online shopping I may as well add it to
my car so yeah that is the first thing
that I picked up so at the second
palette I picked up was the top lip
palette I've been wanting this palette
for so long now and I was so excited
when this was available to purchase it
basically just comes with warm shades a
little bit of cool tones as well I love
the purples and the Browns and the
creams I'll try to upload a tutorial
featuring it so yeah that is the Tarte
lip palette so next up I picked up a
highlighter and this is the Laura
Mercier indiscretion highlighter I
wanted to pick this one up when it was
available in Australia but I was too
late because it's a limited edition it
is seriously like the most gorgeous like
champagne gold color I actually have it
on now if you can see it on my face but
yeah definitely a splurge it was quite
expensive but I wanted
get my hands on it for so long so yeah
that's why I picked that one up okay
next up I got some Milani blushes
because as you already know Milani
Luminoso is my favorite blush of all
time so I got a backup of that one which
just looks like that and then I got the
blush in berry and more which looks like
this give it a bit of a swatch so that's
what the blush looks like there it's
actually really really similar to
luminary so it's just a little bit more
on the pinky side absolutely love glowy
blushes so I'm so excited to try out
berry or more the next up I got some
color pop stuff and as you guys well as
you guys already know color pop shipping
is absolutely out of this world it's
like something like 50 Australian
dollars or whatever so I picked up some
super shock shadows highlighters and
lippie stix so first I picked up a blush
in the shade trickery which is just a
really really nice pink color I don't
know how to explain it but that is what
it looks like here I'm not usually a
blush fan but I just like kind of
neutral pink colors so that's why I
picked that one up and then I got the
highlighter in a lunch money which looks
like this I'll give it a swatch I
actually thought this was powder the
first time that I used it so I used it
on top of all of my powder and it kind
of like it went all funny so next time I
use it I'm just gonna make sure I don't
set my face so that's what the hilar
that looks like it's so gorgeous
I can't wait to try it again and then I
picked up two super shock shadows I'm
wearing sequins on my eyelids today and
oh my god these are the most people to
my shows I've ever used in my life and I
also picked up super model which is a
gold I will swatch them for you okay so
this one is sequin which is just a
coppery color and seriously
that is what it looks like and then
supermodel actually no this isn't the
gold one this is supermodel which is
like a pearly highlighter color as well
which is that and then this is the gold
one sorry this one is called get lucky
and it's just a pure gold like it is so
pretty that is what get lucky it looks
like on it is seriously incredible I've
used these eyeshadows heap since I've
got them and I will come and do a
tutorial on them as well so yeah lastly
what I picked up from colour-pop art
there lippie stix now I've seen these
all over Instagram so I was like okay
I've got to pick up some because they're
only $5 u.s. so I picked up the colors
Lumia Frenchie and Tootsie and as you
probably already know Lumia has become
really quickly at one of my favorite
colors so this is what it looks like
swatch it's just exactly like brave
except a little bit more than perfectly
acai I'm obsessed with it and then
Tootsie which is more of a gray beige II
sort of color which looks like that
and then Frenchie which is just a
gorgeous blue based red so tap to pick
that one up so that's what Frenchie
looks like obsessed I love them
lastly I picked up some eyelashes now
these are the I love Vegas may collab
eyelashes and they look like this I am
so surprised that Priceline doesn't stop
these because I know that they stock
I'll or they just don't stop the Vegas
nay ones but I'm going to show you which
ones they got so I got classic charm
which are really really natural
I don't know eyes
to pick up every single style these ones
are called easy elegance which just look
really really wispy like the ardell demi
whispies finally I got shining star
which looks like this
they are amazing their double age is
what I like to wear personally in lashes
so I'm so so so excited to wear these
actually not lastly I did also get the
grand glamour lashes but I've already
used them up I've literally used them
like 15 times already
oh like obsessed with them for like two
weeks but yeah I don't have many more
because they were all gross I kept
throwing them in but I would highly
recommend Green glamour if you're really
into like massive fluffy eyelashes but
yeah they're the ones that I still
haven't used so yeah so that concludes
this whole I hope you guys enjoyed and
if you did don't forget to give it a
thumbs up because it helps me out a lot
and yeah I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
