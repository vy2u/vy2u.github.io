it's a bit of a different sort of video
to what I'm used to filming or used to
doing a voiceover for but today me Akana
who is a makeup artist here on the Gold
Coast as well I did my makeup I haven't
really had any other makeup artist in my
makeup before so I thought I would just
chat you guys through what she's doing
so so primer I think she used a Smashbox
1 the pore minimizing primer and she's
just put that all on with like a large
sort of stippling brush I found this
video so interesting to watch back just
because I do makeup so different to her
like I do my eyes first where she
focuses on face first and yeah just like
little things that she did I just didn't
even think of doing like you'll see when
it comes to the eyes but now she's using
another primer it's by Smashbox and it
is the photo finish primer Iser it's
like a primary moisturizer in one and
just putting that on my face as well
then for foundation she went in with the
Stila stay all day the shade I think she
used is number six and put that all over
up my face and she likes to buff her
foundation in and whereas I like using
the Beauty Blender so that's something
different that we both do I love this
foundation I've used it before it's
really good coverage and I love the
colors as well
for concealer she used a bareMinerals
one and she'd just place it on sink my
eyes she doesn't really do the whole
highlighting like the center of the face
or anything like that so she just mainly
puts the concealer underneath the eyes
and then just blends it out with a brush
then she takes the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just uses that to
set unsink the eyes just like I do but
what I would do is bake and then she
also uses that same a translucent powder
to set the rest of the face I personally
like using a pressed powder because it
gives more coverage but yeah this works
really well as well and I've never
really tried this to set my face before
so that was a bit different so then on
to eyes she's using the Aran big
cosmetics I'm pretty sure this is just
like a black eyeliner and I guess she's
using this as a base because she is
doing like a black smoky eye so she's
just placing that down first
and then I think she just goes ahead and
blends it all out
then she was doing the other exactly the
same just placing that color all over
the lid and then she goes in with a
Smashbox palette and takes a black
eyeshadow and just basically uses that
to set that in place and then I'm
guessing she's gonna be blending out the
edges so they look seamless
then she used the heater Beauty warm
brown obsessions palette and she took
that ready sort of color and she used
that to transition the black just with a
blending brush and yeah just blending
until there's no harsh lines
I seemed you guys up so you guys can see
the eyes in detail but yeah she just
basically just keeps blending until
there's no edges or anything like that
you
then she's using a black eyeliner just
true tight line and just line my top
lash line
you
then she's taking some eyelash killers
which I've never seen before they're
really clever I actually probably should
invest in some of them and just curling
my lashes before falsies first she likes
to apply mascara where I like to apply
mascara after falsies so she uses like a
little tissue so none of the mascara
gets on to my cheek which is a pretty
good idea not gonna lie
you
and then she's going on to face which is
using this Smashbox palette and is
taking that middle shade to bronze up my
face
you
then just taking this mecha max bronzer
as well I think it's just a map one and
just using that as well
you
and she's taking one of my favorite is
the mecca cause medica and the lighting
a powder I'm pretty sure that's what
it's called and highlighting my face
you
then she's continuing on with the lower
lashline is taking that same eyeliner
I'm pretty sure it's the Aaron being
Swan and just using that true line my
waterline
and she goes all the way into the inner
tear-duct
and then I think she's just dragging
some product along the lower lash line
as well and then also blending it out
you
so I'm guessing she'll use the light
blacks and the Browns out of that
Smashbox palette just to ensure that it
looks all nice and smoky
you
and then she takes that Hilda Beauty
palette just that same transition color
we use up the top and just using that to
smoke at the bottom as well
you
then just taking a a Napoleon loose I
dust in the shade pink champagne and
just using that to highlight the inner
corners of my eyes I would usually go
for something like more wipes I love
like a bright inner corner highlight and
then she's popping on some model rock
lashes these ones were quite dramatic
but I think they tied in really well
with the eye look because it was really
dark and dramatic then she's just taking
some more mascara and bring it on my
bottom lashes never thought of doing it
with a tissue I might try that one time
and then I guess she's just blending the
false lashes in with my real ones then
she's just lining my lips I'm not sure
which lip liner shoes I think it's from
Napoleon it just looks like a nerd and
just lightly lining my lips
and then she's taking this what is it
called something silk glass I can't
really read the name properly and just
putting something pretty natural on the
lips just because we went pretty
dramatic with the eyes
you
and then she's going in with the Naz
Maldives blush and popping that on my
cheeks and she doesn't use a setting
spray so yeah that is the completed look
I hope you guys enjoyed watching learnt
something new - what I like would
usually do if you want to see more
videos like this with other makeup
artists or even with me a Conor but not
as you know dramatic has this look that
and let me know in the comments down
below
I love you guys so much and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
