so today's client tutorial will be on
how I cover acne but first I just wanted
to thank my beautiful model Catherine
for coming in this video has been a so
damn highly requested so I hope you guys
learn something new and enjoy the video
so because catherine has oily skin I use
the new benefit Matt rescue primer if
you guys have oily skin or you don't
have a primer for oily skin in your kit
I would 100% recommend this one it's
amazing and then I went on with the
benefit Porefessional over the top of
her problem area to smooth out the
surface and it also a place it around
her nose where she had quite a bit of
open pores and I'm just using this with
a stippling brush and then as always I'm
spraying her face with some mac fix+ and
then I'm going in with the green
concealer out of this BH Cosmetics
palette this does look crazy at first
but I promise you it will look normal
after I've blended in added concealer
and foundation so for those of you that
don't know green concealer actually
counteracts red tones in your skin I've
had this palette for a few years now but
I wasn't planning on using it today but
I couldn't find my la girl green Pro
concealer which is what I would normally
use but this actually worked pretty well
in the end so after I've applied that
I'm going to be blending it all in with
a damp Beauty Blender
so then I'm going in with the mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 15 and I'm
just using that same concealer brush and
going over and covering her problem to
areas
then for foundation I'm using the Mac
Studio Fix fluid in n C 20 and buffing
that all in with a damp Beauty Blender
you
you
so then I'm just priming her eyelids
just using the leftovers from the mac
prolongwear concealer
you
so to conceal and highlight I'm using at
the Urban Decay weightless concealer and
this is in the lightest shade and I'm
pretty sure it's called fair neutral so
I'm just placing that underneath her
eyes bridge of her nose Cupid's bow a
bit on her chin and a bit on her
forehead and then blending it out
also I just really wanted to quickly say
story about the lighting changes it does
like kind of go from warm to cool
throughout the video but there's nothing
I can do to change that just what I
would say sorry but yeah I'm just
setting that concealer with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and then to
set the rest of her face I'm using the
astrology fresh and flawless face powder
in the shade natural
and then I'm just wiping away that
excess translucent powder from the
baking so set her eyelids I'm just also
using the laura mercier translucent
powder on a elf blush brush it's like
one of my faves for setting underneath
the eyes or on the eyelids so the brows
I always always always use the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow color
it's just amazing it has every single
color you need I would highly recommend
it if you are a freelance makeup artist
so I'm pretty sure the color I used for
her is soft brown and I'm just using
that on my fav eyebrow brush which is by
pony cosmetics
- sculptor brows I'm using the same
concealer I use underneath her eyes
which was the urban decay or weightless
concealer in the lighter shade I'm just
using that with a concealer brush go to
bronze and contour of course I'm using
my favorite hauler vibe benefit bronzer
and I'm just using that on the brush
that it came with
and then I'm just going in and sculpting
her nose I'm not doing it
true hectically but I'm using the same
Haller by benefit bronzer and I'm using
that with a brush that I got from eBay
I'll leave it down below I'm pretty sure
it's a Jessup brush so yep really really
affordable so to Baker contour i'm using
the laura mercier translucent powder
again and it's my favorite translucent
powder ever I used to love the face of
Australia one but ever since I started
using this I literally don't reach for
that one anymore as affordable as it is
I'm obsessed with this one so yep I'm
just baking her face with a angled
sponge and then for blush I decided to
go with a matte one which is Melba by
Mac and then to highlight I'm using the
balm cosmetics mary-lou manizer and she
was having a bit of a giggle because she
recognized and she was like oh my god I
use this everyday as well so I was like
EOS bitch it's literally the best
highlighter ever by the way if you're
wondering Katherine was one of my
viewers that reached out to me when I
did that snapchat asking for people with
acne prone skin so shout out to you girl
you look amazing I'm just brushing off
that excess baked and then just like
blending everything together I like to
blend like the blush contour and
highlight and then her face I don't know
I just blend for days so for eyes I'm
using the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette and I'm going in with that shade
and I'm placing that in her crease as a
transition shade
then I'm going in with that darker shade
and I'm also placing that in her crease
slash in the outer section of her eyes
then I'm going in with the Laura Geller
gilded honey highlighter and I actually
try to use it as a eye shadow but it
wasn't as pigmented as I thought it
would be but it still kind of looked
nice I went over it with another gold
later on but yeah I'm just packing that
on the mobile lid and then I'm grabbing
the darker shade in the palette
and I'm just using that in the outer
corners of her eyes so then again I'm
grabbing that middle brown eyeshadow and
running that on her lower lashline and
making it a little bit smoky she was
actually going just to the doctor's
after this so I didn't want to do
anything dramatic I didn't want to put
black in her waterline or anything so I
kind of kept the eyes a bit simple
so yeah instead of putting eyeliner at
the top I decided to just take that
matte dark shade and I'm just working
that in the lashline and then I went
over the top of the gold with the color
pop I'm pretty sure this shade is get
lucky but I'll leave it down below if
it's not and then I went to line her
waterline with the Rimmel scandaleyes
eyeliner in nude and then I am just
coating her top and bottom lashes with
the benefit roller lash mascara
so for lashes I'm using the two 1/2 by
model rock and I'm using that with my
house of lashes lash glue so for lips
I'm using the essence in the nude lip
liner and over the top I'm using at the
Mac angel lipstick
and then finally I'm spraying her face
with the urban decay these slick oil
control setting spray and this is the
completed look I hope you guys enjoyed
