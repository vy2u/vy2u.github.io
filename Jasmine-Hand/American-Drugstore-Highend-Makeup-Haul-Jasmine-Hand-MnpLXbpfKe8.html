channel so today's video is super
exciting because it is a massive
American makeup haul obviously I didn't
go to America or anything to get these
but I used a shipping service called
go sand to get all of these amazing
products to me here in Australia I am so
jealous of you if you live in America
because you guys get the best and
biggest variety of just everything in
general and just the prices are so much
cheaper than here in Australia so I envy
you I've actually tried most of it I'm
actually wearing it in this video and
I've tried it outside of this video just
so I can give you guys a little bit of a
review instead of just hauling the
products and not knowing much about them
so for those wondering how a shipping
service works I will tell you right now
it's so easy and their service is
amazing so all you do is you create a
account I have a three month free VIP
membership for you guys
I'll leave the code on the screen and in
the description box down below so for
example if you wanted to shop at color
pop under sassy Beverly Hills so for any
makeup stores or online stores that you
can't get here in Australia so you
create a list of the items that you want
it doesn't have to be makeup related you
can get like shoes clothes whatever you
want just as long as you provide a link
so they know exactly what you want and
if they can get it so when you go to
checkout they give you a Us address
which is located in Delaware which is a
tax free state so you won't be paying
any tax and then your items will be
shipped to that address in Delaware and
once all of your items have arrived at
the warehouse in Delaware they actually
send you pictures so it's really cool so
when they get each item they send you a
picture which goes onto your account and
you can view as the products come in and
then once everything has arrived at the
warehouse then they package it all up in
one big box like this and then send it
to your Australian address one of the
things I love about using shipping
services like go send is that you save
so much money on shipping actually 80%
according to their website which is
really cool for us here in Australia
because we don't want to be paying an
arm and a leg for makeup so I'm actually
glad these shipping services do exist
because it makes makeup more accessible
here in Australia which is pretty
unheard
just because everything in Australia is
super expensive and there's not much of
a variety than America I also have a
link to my go store which is just
basically a page of all the items that I
got so if you want something that I've
hauled today you can just easily go onto
it and get the link and add it to your
list if you want okay I think that's
enough information for now I'm going to
go ahead with my haul oh my god I'm so
excited so everything came like really
securely packed in bubble wrap and tape
so if you're just wondering what their
packaging is like it's really secure and
nothing broke or anything like that so
everything arrived well and in place
which was amazing the last thing you
want is like a smashed pallet or
whatever and that's just so annoying so
the first thing I picked up was the
Milani concealed and perfect two-in-one
foundation I actually saw it last luxe
uses in one of her videos and I thought
may as well pick it up because it's so
affordable it's in the shade sand beige
which matches perfectly to my fake tan I
use loving tan for those that don't know
so the consistency of this foundation is
really really thick and it's really hard
to blend it's supposed to be a concealer
and foundation in one it is as you can
see really really full coverage I love
the color but it was really hard to work
with maybe I won't try using a Beauty
Blender and I just feel like it was
really sticky when I used it maybe next
time I'll use a brush or something but
the coverage was amazing and after I
blended everything all in it looked
really flawless on my face so I'm
actually really glad I picked this up
and I'll definitely be using this in
tutorials so I also picked up another
foundation this is the Marc Jacobs
remarkable foundation I have seriously
wanted this foundation for so long that
ever since I saw people wearing it on
like Instagram and YouTube so I was like
okay I need this in my life this
foundation has become my absolute holy
grail foundation the coverage is
literally ridiculous like all I did was
I just put three dots I don't really
like the applicator though like it's
just like a thingamabob ELISA has a
stick if it didn't have a stick I would
have been so annoyed I would literally
just put three dots on each cheek and
trued onto my forehead and it was like
too much I was like what the hell is
this pigment it's so amazing I got this
in the shade 44 golden medium which is a
tad
true yellow for me but I can make it
work I probably wouldn't wear it during
the day but I've wanted our clothing a
few times and it was fine I probably
wouldn't wear it during the day but I
definitely do want to get another shade
which I can wear during the day when I
have fake tan on oh yeah this is the
best foundation ever you need it in your
life like you need it so next up I got
an eyeshadow palette and oh my god I
have one of this palette for so long but
it's always sold out so I'm so glad I
got my hands on it
it is the violet Boss Hogg rail
eyeshadow palette are you ready for it
look how amazing those colors look
they're definitely my kind of colors I
actually have them on my eyes today they
blend amazingly and they're really
pigmented as well the only colors I
didn't really find pigmented with these
top three lighter shades but all the
darker shades are amazing so yeah I'm
obsessed with this palette I'll
definitely do a tutorial with it next up
I got my very first brand new NAS
product I know how weird is that I don't
own any brand new nas products I do
actually have like a cheek palette but
I'm pretty sure it's fake I bought it
off this group from Facebook years ago
tried it once and I've just never used
it again just because I just didn't
really like it I think that palette
might put me off not I don't know I just
haven't tried anything ever since so I
thought I would pick up the orgasm blush
I'm pretty sure this is like limited
edition because it's bigger than the
original blush pans so it looks like
this and it has that chick in the film
and that is the color I love Coralie
shimmery blushes it's really similar to
hot mama by the balm which is why I
picked it up because I'm obsessed with
that blush and I really need to stop
using it and try something else so
that's why I picked up this one next up
I just picked up a backup of my Holy
Grail translucent powder which is the
Laura Mercier one I just figured while
it's cheaper in America and may as well
just add it to my car
it's probably about twenty dollars
cheaper than here in Australia so that's
just what it looks like if you watch my
videos and you know I'm in love with it
I use it on all my clients as well so
yeah that's just the laura mercier
translucent powder next up I got a few
pairs of lashes I actually got three
pairs I'm wearing one of the pairs on
now they are the Koko lashes in the
style Queen B I've been watching desi
and Katy for a while now and they
brave about these lashes all the time
they always say that it's their favorite
lashes so I thought I would pick some up
and holy they are amazing the only
thing I'm not too fond about about the
lashes is that they're really wispy like
they go in different directions I kind
of wish the lashes just went in one
direction but that's alright I really
like how dramatic and full they are on
my eyes I was kind of skeptical about
them when I added them to my list just
because I thought they'd be a little
less dramatic than what they are but
they are seriously so amazing and
they're really cheap as well I think
they're only like eight dollars u.s.
each so that's amazing I've worn these
three times now so highly recommend
these lashes next up I got a plain black
beauty blender I find that this one out
of all the other colors is the best I
don't know why I think it's just a lot
squishier I have used this so it's not
in the box obviously but I needed a new
one because my ones were getting old I
think these ones are the pro beauty
blenders I saw on their website but yeah
I love the black ones I wouldn't ever go
back from the black one so that's why I
picked that one up and lastly I got the
glam glow gravity mud firming treatment
mask I actually did receive this in a PR
package from Mecca for their skin goals
campaign so I had no idea that I was
going to get that package so I was like
damn it
I already bought this one but that's
right now I have two and I'm so glad I
do have two because it is such an
amazing mask
it's so cool to peel off peeling off
this mask is actually a lot harder than
it looks
I realize that you need quite a thick
layer for the peel to come off all in
one hit when I first use this mask I
used a really thin layer because
obviously don't want to waste it because
it's like $100 so I kind of had a bit of
difficulty removing the mask but yeah
the second time I use it I use a thick
layer and it just came off all in one
peel it really does make your face feel
firm and it feels like you've had a
facelift and it's really cooling as well
though if you're a mask type of gal and
you have a budget for expensive face
masks then I would recommend this one
it's amazing they also included one of
their ghost sandbags I'm pretty sure
everyone gets this in their orders and
inside they have a makeup bag which is
super cute and it looks like it could
fit a lot of things in it
that logo go sand in it and if you can
see it that's super cool Thanks so then
I got this little bag as well it also
says go cent on it with a few samples so
I got the laura mercier true lip lip
gloss which I'm actually wearing over
the top of Posie K by Kylie cosmetics
not sure if I just give you random
samples or if they came with like the
makeup from that shipping you know how
sometimes when you do a makeup order and
they give you free samples so maybe
that's from that which is pretty cool
the next sample I got was by way so this
is their vinyl Couture mascara that is
sort of cool oh it's so mini that's what
it looks like oh and that's the wand oh
my god that's so cool that's going in my
bag hey so the next sample I got my god
these samples are sick this is the
hourglass ambient lighting primer oh my
god this is gonna be the smallest tube
that is so cute haven't actually heard
about this primer I don't know if it's
new or not but so excited to try it out
the next sample I got is by perricone
m.d it's a face finishing moisturizer
all that smells really nice cool oh my
god Yama I'm having one go send M&amp;amp;Ms
they're actually M&amp;amp;Ms what the
that's so good and then they sent two
pens with their logo on it and these
super cool glasses which I probably will
never wear William is my brother
actually very fashion so that's
everything that I got I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul and if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and also
don't forget that I have my go Store
