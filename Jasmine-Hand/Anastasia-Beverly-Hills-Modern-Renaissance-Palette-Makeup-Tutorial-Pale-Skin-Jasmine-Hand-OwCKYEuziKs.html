channel so today's video is going to be
of this makeup look on my face I
experimented with this little inner
corner cut creasing and I actually
really liked how it turned out although
the photo that I was getting in spoof
rum it looked way better on her eye
shape because she had different like a
different eye shape to me but I do like
how it turned out it's a little bit
something different than what I'm used
to I used the new Anastasia Beverly
Hills modern renaissance palette how
amazing do the colors look I'm obsessed
with this palette already and I also
tried out the jeffree star skin frost
and I'm wearing ice cold on my cheeks at
the moment and I was deceased at the
moment I put it on my cheeks like it was
 amazing anyways enough with the
rambling if you'd like to see how I
created this makeup look then keep on
watching so the primer I'm going to go
in with the benefit Porefessional
I think there's any left in this one I
just went everywhere putting that all
over my skin is broken out because it's
that time of the month so annoying so it
foundation today I'm going to use the
new will not really new but new for me
because I only just got this Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation in warm nude I
did pick up sand as well for when I'm
really turned but I'm not that tanned
right now it's kind of like wearing off
so I think warm nude will suit me the
best I'm just gonna top that all over
and then blend it in
I'm going to go in with a couple more
pumps because want this look to be full
coverage then I'm going to go in with
the Born This Way concealer in the shade
very fair because I am quite pale I'm
just going to chuck that underneath my
eyes to highlight I don't think I've
ever been this pale before I'm always so
tanned
then I'm just going to blend that all in
and then I'm going to take my Laura
Mercier trans whoa
Lucent powder and I'm just going to bake
that area
then I'm just going to set the rest of
my face with the Australia's fresh and
flawless in the shade deep natural so
I'm just going to put that all over
the bronzer I've been obsessed with the
betty loumanizer which is this one it's
just the most gorgeous bronzing color
and it's not even that shimmery like
when I first got this palette I was like
oh I won't be touching that because that
just looks like a shimmery bronzer but
it looks so gorgeous on the skin I'll
show you I've been using it on most of
my clients now it just looks amazing
just going to go around my forehead area
I'm just going really light handle with
this because I am quite pale usually I
would really pop it on when I'm tanned
but I'm just going to make sure that I
am quite light handed with this I don't
look you know like I'm from Jersey Shore
or something and then for blush I'm just
going to take this Too Faced perfect
flush blush which looks like that it's
just a really nice shimmery blush but
not too shimmery
and just placing that on the apples and
bringing it towards my temples so now
I'm just going to whoops fake
so I usually just wait like a minute or
so before I brush it off I don't like to
keep it on for too long otherwise I find
that the lines a bit harsh
so I'm just going to really lightly dust
it off now then I'm going to go in with
the new jeffree star cosmetics ice cold
highlighter and they receive this today
so I'm so excited to use it and I
thought that this color would be perfect
to match with my skin tone at the moment
so I'm just going to go in with a fan
brush oh yeah okay that is so and
setting up way too much on
that is so pretty I'm just going to put
a little bit like I'm into the widow's
okay I'm obsessed with this highlighter
so if I should I say I'm going to use
the new anastasia beverly hills modern
renaissance palette these are the colors
how freaking amazing do they look I've
already had to play around with them so
that's why they're not all perfect and
this is already dirty from eyeliner and
just foundation stuff I kind of do wish
the packaging was like her other
palettes but that's alright it just gets
really really dirty easily because it's
that kind of material so first up I'm
starting with burnt orange and just
placing that in my crease as a
transition of shade by the way this
brush is just from my Naked 3 palette
that I used to have it's actually pretty
good for blending so I saw a picture on
Instagram the other day and it was like
an eye look but like the inner corner
was like a cut crease I don't know I'm
gonna try and recreate it I don't know
how well I'm going to do it or if I'm
just gonna fail but I'm gonna give it a
go
anyways because it looked really cool
maybe it was just cool on her eye shape
I've got quite like semi hooded eyes I
wouldn't say they're haunted but um like
I don't really have a defined crease and
she did have a defined crease in her
picture I'm going in with love-letter
which is the pinky purpley shade in the
palette and I'm literally just putting
that basically everywhere so I'm working
that in the crease
okay I'm going to take a piece of sticky
tape and see if this is going to work
like that so I'm just going to put it
like here
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
grab a bit more of that color and
concentrate that I look so strange
concentrate that like near the line okay
now I'm going to take this off oh yeah
I'm going to clean up this bit and I'm
just going to blend this out okay now
I'm going to grab the gold color which
is called Primavera just on a brush like
this and pack that directly under um
that line and now I'm taking Cyprus
Boombah which is the matte brown shade
and I'm just going to use that in the
outer corner just to bring some darkness
into the look just using that
love-letter shade to blend everything
all out I'm going to take love-letter
and run that underneath my lash line I
wasn't really planning on making this
look dramatic but I guess I am I'm just
going to quickly line the top lashline
I'm just going to use the new Too Faced
stretch mark are
so in the sky money is the new two-faced
waterproof one adding falsies now
so if it let's I'm going in with the dry
to cosmetics nude lipliner
and then going in with stripped by
Anastasio Beverly Hills it's like my
favorite nerd
and then over the top I'm going to go in
with uh no stars ears toffee lipgloss so
this is a final look I hope you guys
enjoyed watching and if you did of
course don't forget to give it a thumbs
up for me comment below what you'd like
to see next on my channel and I'll see
