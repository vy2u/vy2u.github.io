channel so today's video is very
exciting so I only just received the new
under star C of Beverly Hills glow kids
this one is in Moon child which is
definitely my favorite as soon as I saw
it so this one is different to her glow
kits that she already has this one has
six pads and they're in square form
these ones are all iridescent they are
beautiful I actually had pink velvet on
with this makeup one of the things I
love about this palette already is not
only can you use it as a highlighter but
you can obviously use it on your eyes
and even dab it on your lips I actually
had blue ice and a mixture of pink heart
dabbed over my liquid lipstick from this
makeup tutorial that I'll have listed
down below if it's up but if it's not
it'll definitely be up soon but yeah
it's so versatile it's just the most
stunning palette like even the packaging
like you just need this palette just
purely because it's just going to look
good in your beauty room like let's be
real and the other palette she has is
called sweet which also just looks
amazing I love the purple so the colors
are marshmallow sassy grape butterscotch
and taffy and they just look stunning
I can't wait to swatch them I haven't
actually used this one yet but this
butterscotch one reminds me of so
Hollywood and that's like my favorite
ever highlight our first palette i'm
gonna swatch is the moonchild palette
and the first one I'm gonna swatch
you're kidding oh my god oh my god oh my
god pray for me
oh thank the Lord anyways the
first shade I'm gonna swatch is called
blue eyes and I'm just watching them all
on a reborn small highlighter brush is
my favorite color to brush at the moment
I might actually just swatch the one
cheek and then another color on the
other cheek and then wipe them off and
do like you know you know what I mean
this is blue eyes these are so pigmented
like look at that
obviously these highlighters aren't for
everyday use if you're into it and you
like wearing these colors everyday by
all means go for it that's amazing I
wish I had more confidence wearing
colored highlighters like even colored
lipsticks I even get scared wearing like
massive fake
she's out in public because I hate
everyone like staring at me I hate being
the center of attention so I kind of go
on the natural makeup side when I'm like
going out in public I know that sounds
so weird
obviously when I'm going clubbing and
it's nighttime I go hectic with
my makeup and I actually probably would
wear pink heart which is what I wore
when I filmed this tutorial which will
be up soon I'm not sure if will be up
before or after this video but if you're
wanting to splurge on something amazing
then I would I'd pick it up like I know
I probably won't wear these often but
like you just have to have it in your
kit like you just have to anyway so
that's blue ice on I'm just going to get
a tissue and just take off the excess on
this brush and swatch star so this one
kind of looks like a silvery one
probably one of the most wearable ones
in the palette but we'll soon find out
oh my god
you're joking okay this one is like a
very very pigmented silvery blue color
more silver definitely would not wear
this you know everyday but holy if
you want to be seen from outer space you
need it so the next chain I'm going to
swatch is purple horseshoe which is this
one which is what I've got on my eyes
today amazing this palette is so cool
okay and then on this other cheek I'm
going to swatch pink heart which is my
favorite so far it's so pretty
this one is seriously amazing I probably
would wear this one like going clubbing
I just think it looks stunning
so that's pink heart the next color I'm
going to swatch is called Lucky Clover
and this one's a green really excited to
see what this one's gonna look like Wow
by the way guys I'm putting on a lot so
you can see like the color oh love it
okay so the last one I'm going to swatch
is called a blue moon
this one's really similar
to that silvery one once again obviously
putting on a lot so you guys can see the
color but so so cool okay so now I'm
going to swatch these sweet
glow kit I'm so excited so these are
what the colors look like so the first
color I'm going to go in with is
marshmallow which is like a yellowy
based highlighter well I love this one
that is amazing
I swear I've said amazing like 50 times
throughout this video but now I'm going
to swatch my favorite out of this
palette which is called butterscotch
dead oh my god I would wear this color
every day this is like my color I love
Goldy yellowy highlights alright so we
have two more shades left to swatch I'm
going to go in with sassy gray which is
a lavender color that is so cool really
really similar to the purple shade from
the moon child glow camp actually really
similar then the other one is called
taffy I think this color would suit
darker skin tones more like so it does
have like a really bright undertone to
it
so that's taffy so they are all the
color swatch I hope you guys enjoyed
this video in my personal opinion if you
are looking for a new highlighting
palette that you could wear day to day I
would definitely suggest the the sweets
one over the moon child one they do have
like the Sun dipped and the VAT glow one
which are definitely more wearable than
this just because this one has you know
those two shades the grape on and the
taffy one that you wouldn't typically
use every day but marshmallow and
butterscotch are mazing they blend so
well they're not powdery they're really
nice and smooth and buttery just like
every other Anastasio product
I'm obsessed with their brand they're
probably up there with one of my
favorite all-time makeup brand just
because they supported me since day one
since I had no makeup and they're so
kind to me and literally my first makeup
purchase or one of my first makeup
purchases was a I broke it by uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills when I used to
get my eyebrows waxed ages ago in a
little salon in Broad Beach and they
stopped Anasazi Beverly Hills so I
purchased my very first kit and that was
one of my first makeup products that I
ever owned and I fell in love with it
and ever since I purchased that I went
crazy and started to buy other things
ever since then she's been spoiling me
on Instagram and showing me so much love
and support and generously gifting me
all of her new stuff which I'm so
eternally grateful for seriously so if
you're watching this anastacio or novena
Congrats on these pallets they're
amazing um but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed watching this video and if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
I'll leave a link down below where you
can purchase these from I'm not a
hundred percent sure if they're still
available on her website but if you're
from Australia I'm pretty sure they ship
internationally so you'll be able to get
them no matter where you are in the
world this video isn't sponsored or
anything like that I genuinely love
their brands so obviously I'm going to
support the brands that I love so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
