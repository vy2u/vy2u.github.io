like people around on this lap so today
I'm heading to Bali I'm so glad my fly
wasn't cancelled because of the recent
volcano issue so all flights are all on
time and on schedule which I'm so happy
about I just checked in and I'll be
boarding in like 20 minutes so I'll
probably just start blogging when I get
there because it's pretty boring working
on a plane so yeah I will see you guys

highways to my shadow through the
sunrays and
the way melodies we played

seminyak it's called Phillip Mandela

and everywhere else I stayed so you guys
can check them out if you like yesterday
we didn't really do much we got in at
around 1 p.m. the driver took us here we
just chilled for a bit
and then we went and got some Starbucks
just got a coffee and a cake and then we
went for a walk on the beach at night
for dinner and just got something to eat
it's so nice to just finally chill out
especially after my busy formal week
like three weeks ago it's really
refreshing to just wake up and not have
anything planned for the day that's like
one thing I love about being holidays is
just not having to worry about being
anywhere or doing anything just sleeping
in four days is amazing today I think
we're going through that Beach Club it's
called Mississippi it looks really cool
it's got like a little platform where
you can jump in the pool and stuff and
have lunch and drinks so we're gonna go
do that today and then tonight I'm not
sure we'll just see where the night
takes us I guess and yeah we're off to
breakfast soon I think we're gonna go to
sister fields or something nearby
because we're staying pretty central of
Seminyak so everything's so close so
yeah I'll see you guys very soon much of
the food

actually went out last night so feeling
a bit hungover but we literally just
checked into Hidden Hills villas in
Alachua is freaking amazing I'll
obviously give you guys a little bit of
a room tour as well but literally can't
really get much better than this to be
honest hey guys so it's now day five I'm
literally losing track of days I always
do when I'm on holidays but literally
just woke up in heaven so you guys so
pretty so today we're going to the edge
and it's basically just like I think
it's a hotel but they have infinity
pools like near the bar so yeah I really
really want to go check that out and
take some cool photos we're just waiting
on breakfast now it should be here any
minute and then we're heading over to
the edge at around 12:00 so probably
like chill out for a bit

last night but yeah we're just gonna
chill out and ate and

our beer villa I've stayed here before
with Brittany it is so nice like their
bathroom I'll show you guys in the Torah

quick photo in there but today we're
just probably gonna go shopping because
our villa is really close to like
Poppy's Lane one and Poppy's Lane two

markets like here so we're gonna go do
that get some lunch and then I think
we're gonna go out clubbing tonight we
haven't really been out out much like we
went out to nights ago one was staying
in seminyak but other than that we
didn't really go out at all why - we
just went to beach clubs and stuff for
dinner um so yeah we're gonna go hit up
sky gardens and I haven't been there in
years but yeah we've just been like
chilling out I haven't really been
vlogging that much yeah I just wanted to
just chill out and relax this holiday
but I'm gonna probably get into my
swimmers heading to the pool and take a
few pics so yeah I will see you guys
later
confetti
hey guys so we're now in that gillies
Island I lost my phone when we're in leg
yawns so I haven't really been vlogging
as much because I've just been so off it

hey guys so it's day two now in Ubud and
this morning we just had some breakfast
and now polish and I'm out of breath
because we went to the gym and then
realized we forgot our speakers so I
just gone back to get some speakers I'm
gonna go do a cheeky little gym sash
because I'm literally having like gym
withdrawals it's so weird everywhere
we've stayed we haven't really had
access to a gym so this is like the only
resort that has it so we're taking full
advantage of that so I'll probably just
do some like cardio and weights I don't
even know what the I'm gonna do
because I have 45 and the only reason
why I do have 45 is because everything's
all planned for you and you just like do
what they say I probably just do like
some squats with some weights or
something I don't know honest I don't
know maybe Peter can give me some tips
this is a bit of a gym junkie so yeah I
guess I will tell you guys along we're
gonna go to the Monkey Forest later on

doesn't get snatched because apparently
