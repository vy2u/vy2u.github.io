channel so for today's video I'm gonna
do a little boob job sort of an update
Q&amp;amp;A type video just because you guys
have asked me so many questions since
getting them done so I thought I'll sit
down in this video and answer them all
for you guys so it has been that let me
see how many days it's been since my
surgery day it has been a week and two
days
and honestly I'm feeling amazing I just
can't sleep on my side like just as yet
it is a little bit uncomfortable but so
I find that my recovery was quite quick
thank God because I honestly thought I'd
be like out of the game for weeks and
weeks but I'm I'm so happy right now so
when I went for my weekly checkup they
changed all my dressings cleaned it up a
little because it was a little bit
bloody underneath all the dressings and
stuff I put new dressings on over the
incisions and then they also put more on
my nipples but they left the actual
nipple exposed so I just have like true
dressings on my nipples and then just
like underneath and then where they
obviously like had to realign the nipple
I've got like a scar down here I'm just
gonna get straight into the questions
before I get sidetracked if you knew
what you know now about the after pain
sleepless nights tightness in the chest
etc would you do it again the first day
post-op was like literally the worst for
me because I couldn't even start my
stretches like post-op so I was in so
much pain I was so out of it but other
than that like the days after the first
day are fine like and all not fine but
they're like it's not like excruciating
they you just want to like roll up in a
ball and die like it is it's bearable
you can still walk around and do stuff
but like yeah I would do it again
because obviously have to get implants
changed every 15 to 20 years I think or
10 to 15 and obviously like when I
signed up to do this surgery like I
obviously knew that I had to do it every
10 to 15 years ya know I would
definitely go through it again and one
of the main questions that most people
were asking was why did you
to get a boob job so if you guys are new
to my channel I lost 20 kilos two years
ago and my boobs have never been the
same ever since so when I was at my
heaviest which was around 85 to 90 kilos
I had like a bruise like massive boobs
and I've had massive boobs like my whole
life and obviously with the weight loss
like a majority fat so I lost basically
all of my boobs and when I went in for
my consultation
he said underneath all that excess skin
because that was pretty much like the
whole volume of my boobs and my bra size
was still like d double D because the
skin would fill up the cup because I
feel like oh they look the same size
like I don't really like seeing
different so even my friends were like
oh like I thought you already had big
food if only they knew what they looked
like without a bra like I was so
self-conscious of it like I don't know
they just they suck really really low
like really really saggy and I was yet
just so self-conscious of it so I've
been thinking about doing it for about a
year now and the pain was what put me
off watching other people's videos and
because I'm not good with pain I was
like nah calm but then I really like I
really really wanted to get it done so I
was like you know what I'm just gonna do
it like I've wanted to do it for so long
I'm just gonna have to man up and do it
and probably the best decision ever like
I'm so happy so yeah that is probably
the main reason why but it done hey jazz
how how much roughly is it to get your
boobs done what size did you go
which doctor did you go to pros and cons
to get your boobs done and how long does
it take for them to form naturally cool
heaps of questions in one so I paid
$15,000 that's like including like the
theater fees and the anaesthetic boob
jobs originally like around ten thousand
but because I had to have a lift as well
it was an extra five so I paid fifteen
thousand dollars all up and I went to
dr. Craig late at the lake clinic and
yeah
a really really nice guy and no this is
not sponsored I paid for it out of my
own money what size did you go so in my
consultation
he took a 3d image of my boobs before
and then they had like a program where
you can like digitally enhance the boobs
and like so he can show you roughly what
they're gonna look like so he
recommended 375cc and I had no idea
about CCS like I was just gonna leave it
up to him and like see what he thinks
um because I'm not like tiny like in the
chest like my chest is quiet I don't
know not broad but like I don't have a
tiny chest like I'm not a tiny person so
he said you can get away with 375cc he
originally asked me what I wanted and I
showed him a few pictures from other
surgeons or just like Google Images or
like I like this shape I wasn't like
round I was actually considering the
teardrop but he said because of my lip
that I had to like get done he
recommended to get round implants so I
got round textured wait did I get
texture I think I just get textured no
maybe not
I'm gonna have to look into that and
I'll leave it in the description box
down below so I got round 375cc which is
like equivalent to a double D pros and
cons about getting at your boobs on well
obviously cons the pain which I spoke
about before and obviously pros you
don't have to wear bras law you do but
oh my god that wins obviously I'm gonna
try and wear a bra as much as I can but
like I was just most excited to wear
like you tie up tops and not having to
worry about wearing a strapless bra or
like having your bra exposed and just
your tits just like looking nice and
perky and yeah just not having to worry
about that that's was like the most
excited for
and obviously self-confidence like I'm
so much more confident in my body I
swear they like because like when I had
my like all boobs
I have so much like skin like around
here which I think they cut off because
my whole chest that looks so different
it just looks so like tight and like
lifted and just say like my whole chest
and just could not recognize what was
your biggest fear about getting a boob
job besides the pain when you wake up
well obviously I was a bit nervous about
the size because I was still kind of
unsure because I went and did true
consult because after the first one I
didn't get to play around with all the
implants and stuff like like I didn't
actually have to touch them so I was
like no I want to like touch and feel
like the different sizes and I don't
know he just was pretty set on 375 and
he's like I would not get any bigger not
that I was wanting any bigger but I just
wanted to see like the comparison
between 375 and 400 cc but I'm so glad I
didn't go 400 holy shit like if I went
400 yeah I'm just so glad that I went
with what he recommended because
obviously he knows best he's a surgeon I
was a bit worried about my nipple was
like the areola because he said that he
does actually like cut them to like a
perfect round shape and I was like a bit
nervous about like the aftermath of that
way what my nipples gonna be like really
saw were they're gonna like I don't know
but no everything's fun the nipples
can't even like feel them I didn't
actually realize you actually had to
take them off and likes turn them back
on I know that sounds so messed up but
um yeah that's fine that was another one
of my wore it's just like the nipple bit
but they they look fine so thank God are
you regretting getting a boob job um no
I wouldn't go ahead with the surgery if
I would immediately regret it after I
don't know maybe when I'm like 60 and
I'm like what the fuck did I do when I
was 24 I might regret it down the track
but obviously I'm happy now and that's
all that matters and I'll worry about
that down the track what did your
partner think about getting the boob job
well obviously I don't really like it
wasn't up to him
like ever obviously it's just a bonus
like he didn't he didn't pressure me
into getting it done he wasn't like baby
like he need to be was done like it was
nothing like that I've been talking
about it for ages and yeah like
obviously he's not gonna like love me
any less or love me any more not having
a boob job but ya know he obviously was
all for it
other guy but but yeah he didn't really
have any say in my decision
so yes how long roughly is the healing
process and how long until you can drew
upper body or sleep on your stomach so
they recommended like three months non
like no exercise but they said after the
first two weeks you can start like light
walking so I'm actually off to Perth on
Monday so I probably I know I probably
will go to the gym there I should
probably just do like a treadmill like
cardio or something for an hour but as
for like weights I think around like two
and a half three months push ups and
stuff like that I can't do for way
longer but yeah they just recommended no
strenuous exercise for three months so
like a 45 concreted that for ages and
I'm like so depressed like last week I
was like I have no energy I feel like I
need to work out I was like literally
getting like gym withdrawals like and I
didn't think that was even a thing I was
so sad about not going to have 45 I am
gonna start doing walking on the
treadmill for sure like every day I
probably like to an hour or something
just to like keep my body moving because
I'm not obviously just not going to stop
exercise for three months like that's
just dumb but yeah I'm gonna probably
just do that and maybe like lower body
exercises and I do some squats and stuff
buyers have to be careful with the
weights
I'm as for sleeping on my stomach I
can't even see my side yet I'm like
starting to like be able to but then
when I actually go to roll over onto
like my stomach
I'm like nah it's a little bit still
tender probably next way you can't be
able to but as for now I still sleep on
my back but I don't have to have the
pillow as elevated so it's pretty much
flat up and I'm comfortable sleeping so
he's serious I thought it was a good
idea filming outside what was your first
reaction when you saw your boobs I'm
dying to get mine done now since I've
had children ah to be honest like I
don't even remember waking up I
literally woke up and then literally the
only thing I remember was like the nurse
being like okay let's go let's get up
and I was like wait what and because I
was so out of it like she literally just
helped me out from the bed and like
she's like we need to get moving we need
to start walking and I was like what do
you mean I was so drugged up she like
helped me walk just around and then she
went into the change rooms and she
showed me my boobs like she literally
was like okay I'm gonna show you what
they look like
took my compression bra off and I was
like oh my god like I was still so out
of it to even like look at them properly
I was like yep yeah they look good yeah
and just like she's a backup and then I
just want to met mum where she came
picked me up but the day after I cuz
like when I went home I pretty much like
went straight to sleep but I was just so
out of it I think I had like capes or
something for dinner couldn't even eat
it because I was just so like out of it
the next day I like went into the mirror
I took it off and I had a look properly
and I was like holy shit they're massive
like that was my first reaction and I
was at whoa imagine if I was I was just
thinking like imagine if I went for I
could say say I would have been like but
yes they will settle apparently they do
decrease in size by like 10 percent or
something like that
after the swelling goes down so yeah I
can't to see what they look like in a
couple months from now did you have any
thought about going overseas to get them
done if so what were your reasons to
getting them done closer to home I was
actually looking at surgeons in Sydney
then I was just thinking like that is so
much effort like flanked Sydney for the
day for the console like just whole
airports staying in a hotel
than having to probably stay the night
like in a hospital or whatever I have to
book like a hotel for a few nights
before I could like fly back because I
literally could not think of anything
worse than flying like the first three
days of my surgery so I'd have to stay
in Sydney for a while yeah I've just
rather be like in my own home in my own
bed looked after by like my friends and
family
is there any other cosmetic surgeries
you're considering if so what holiday um
no I don't think I would get like
liposuction or like butt implants that's
just not my thing like I I wasn't like I
wouldn't that I was against plastic
surgery but I wasn't overly keen on it
like if you'd asked me like three years
ago I would be like no freakin way when
I ever do that in my whole life but
obviously things change but no I don't
think I would ever get like butt
implants or like her I don't know I just
think if I wanted to get like that body
I would just work I just rather work
hard for it I'm not against it I'm gonna
get plastic surgery like I'm all for it
well I just got my boobs on but yeah I'm
not I don't think I would get anything
else done I've heard that people have
said their new boobs didn't hold their
shape position and they were not the
same up to having kids he did say that
his clients have had no struggles to
breastfeed obviously you have to get
like something checked like in your milk
or something before you can start
breastfeeding or something like that but
it's like obviously we'll discuss that
when you're planning on having kids or
whatever but he did say he does
recommend having a lift after kids but
I'd probably just wait until I need to
get them swapped and then I'll just have
like the implants swapped and then like
a lift again
in like 10 to 15 years so that's how I
saw it I kind of like justified it like
that so hopefully I'll have kids in 15
years
4 10 10 to 15 years from now so yeah he
did recommend having a lift and then
while I'm at it maybe
so yeah assuming your boob job was
recent how long do you need to take off
work Pierce I thought you looked great
before - Oh MPs love the wedding blogs
thank you so much so I took about three
weeks off work I have my first client
tomorrow and I feel like I could like I
don't feel any pain or any like strain
or anything like that for doing makeup
I'm only doing one client this week and
then I'm off to Perth for a week and
then straight back into it when I get
back
what size bra were you then and what
size are you now so this compression bra
that I have to wear is a double D most
of my bras before because of my excess
skins like what I mentioned before I
like DS or double D's so I hope to god
that most of my bras still fit I can't
wear a underwire bra for three months so
I have to be wearing these compression
bras for the first two weeks and then
after that so next week I can start
wearing like just like supportive crops
or like gym sort of crop tops I probably
just end up wearing like my Calvin Klein
one or something like that and I've got
a few from rock wear that are really
comfortable so when I'm not feeling
wearing this bra which I probably to be
honest like this super comfy I'll
probably just end up wearing this for
three months
they're definitely this around the same
size but not obviously how they look
they look completely different
did you feel sick about being put under
and how is the healing process going
we'll have spoken about the healing
process I'm going good did I feel sick
about going under yes I didn't actually
feel sick hice an aesthetic but the
thought of being put under anesthetic
made me feel sick like just because I've
done my nursing degree and I've been in
theater where they put people to sleep
I just knew the whole process and that's
what I was most nervous of one second so
I like knew because I did my placement
in anesthetics so I knew exactly what
they did like to put you to sleep and
that like I was just like oh I'm gonna
do that to me so I was a bit nervous
about that but honestly like once you're
like laying on the table I just like
we're just gonna give you some sedate is
just to make you relax and you just like
okay and then you're just like I don't
remember anything don't even really
waking up I was just like what just
happened I look down and I was like holy
shit so I think that's basically all of
like the different questions people ask
most people asked like what size did you
go what type of implants so 375cc round
implant I'm pretty sure I can't remember
if he said smooth or textured honestly
I'm so annoyed that I can't remember I'm
gonna have to look through my documents
and let you know but I didn't have to do
any like massages or anything like they
didn't ask me to do that
so I don't know if that has anything to
do with a type of implant but yeah 375cc
round that's what I got but yeah I think
that is all the questions for now thank
you guys so much for watching if you
guys want me to do like a three months
or six month post boobie update and show
you guys like the difference between
what they look like now and what they
look like then I'm more than happy to do
that for you guys so yeah thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
