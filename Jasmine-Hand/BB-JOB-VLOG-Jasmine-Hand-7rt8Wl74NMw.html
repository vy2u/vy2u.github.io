entering at today's appointment but I'm
just trying to do like my exercises and
it really really hurts I don't even like
do this and I like the girls like hands
on your head
like be calm like I won't just do that
little island support because I didn't
sleep I'm like a say 5 degree and go
that's like more flat it's more
comfortable for me at the time but

thought but I can't put my hands down

Thank You Sonny's up head said today is
the worst day yeah yeah you miss your
eyes still look like I'm full of sight
it's proper for the taja I say this just
got to live it it's from PETA
how cute then it came with a little con
that just says hey babe I hope you have
a speedy recovery always thinking of you
and I'm so excited to see you soon
oh that just made my day that's so
pretty there Selena bloom though I can't
wait till these ones that come out oh I
love flowers
it is now second day post-op I am
feeling a bit better I went to had my
checkup yesterday and he said I need to
do some more stretching because I was
really tense it even kind of hurts like
hold this yeah I need to do more
frequent stretching so I'll show you
guys what I have to do I might like put
this up here okay so this is what my
boobs look like you can't really tell
but yeah they're really like they're
sitting pretty high up but obviously
because they're really swollen they're
gonna drop but yeah I'm gonna be I'm
supposed to be doing stretches like this
so hands on the head it's like really
hurts and then kind of like pushing my
elbows back and I supposed to be doing
that every hour and when I have someone
here I need someone to like put pressure
so I can like work these sides muscles
too but yeah so far I'm pretty happy
with how they've turned out they're just
like rock like solid which like scared
me but obviously that's going to like go
down with the swelling I haven't taken
any painkillers today I took one last
night before
went to bed just so I can sleep a little
bit more comfortably but I'm trying to
hold off the painkillers because
apparently it makes you constipated and
that's it she's like the worst feeling
in the world so I've tried not to take
them unless I like I'm really really
uncomfortable but they're only really
uncomfortable bit about it is a
stretching like and I guess in certain
positions it is quite uncomfortable like
last night I didn't really have the best
sleep I kept waking up because I just
wasn't in a comfortable position so yeah
because you have to sleep
pretty much like like this so it's just
not comfortable when I'm used to
sleeping on my side so yeah I'll check
in with you guys throughout the day but
if not I will definitely check in with
you guys tomorrow and for the next
couple days so I'll try and make this
vlog like post up for like 7 days so you
guys can see my recovery so yeah I will
speak to you guys very soon hey guys so
it is now day to post up at night and
just by me stretching throughout the day
I feel so much less tense and tight in
my chest like I feel like I know these
switch / machi married at first sight I
can feel like I can easily like put my
hands on my head now whereas this
morning was a bit of a struggle when I
did it I was like but now I feel like I
can kind of like put my arms up it's
still really tight and like a bit sore
but it's not like excruciating I feel
like I can like now do little things
like flush the toilet open doors
whereas yesterday like there was no way
I could even try and do that for myself
I've not even opened the car door
but and I just felt like this stretching
is really like helped me like in this
whole recovery process but yeah I'm
gonna go and watch the end of married at
first sight and check in with you guys
tomorrow
I don't know if I'm gonna have a
painkiller to
actually I might so I get to sleep so
wake up a few times last night
but yeah I will check in with you guys
tomorrow
and yeah I will take you guys with me on
Monday to my wake follow-up appointment
where he reveals my nips haven't so many
clues yet it's so weird I really want to
sleep my nipples look like because he's
like realigned them and everything like
obviously from the lift that he did so
yeah I will speech you guys tomorrow
morning hey guys so it is now day three
post-op this is the shop this is what my
boobies look like in the compression bra
in a single I'll show you
I've been able to do a lot more with my
arms and stuff like yesterday I
struggled to like put them over my head
and do my stretches but today it's been
a little bit better so this is the
compression bra that I have to wear and
yes when I go this out of the pool hey
but yeah I've been able to like do
little things like open the door and
like brush my hair brush my teeth and
stuff like that I couldn't do yesterday
but the pain is definitely a lot more
bearable today I haven't needed to take
any pain medication
I took some last night to go to bed but
that's about it but yeah they're sitting
pretty high up but obviously they're
still like really swollen so questions
so yeah obviously over time these will
drop a bit and they'll be a bit more
like squishier because they literally
feel so hard like this is just like yeah
it's so hard right now but yeah so far
so good I'm really really happy with
them and yeah I'll check in with you
guys tomorrow to see how I'm going so
it's mixed birthday next weekend
and I'm seriously like so confused on
what to wear because I have to wear this
compression bra for three months and I
don't really have clothes that have like
thicker sort of straps and she found a
top that she thinks I can wear but I
don't think like the back will be
covered so I'm gonna go try that on now
oh this is the top that Vic was talking
about to be honest you can't really see
any other straps I don't know what I'd
wear with it though am I going to feel
this like weird like having boobs like
up here
what the hell so yeah Drakken
yeah so I might wear this with like a
high-waisted skirt or something hey
everyone
so it is now a day for post-op I'm
feeling it so ho much better today like
I literally got up out of bed without
needing help from anyone because usually
like when I'm in bed
I like gets all really tense and stuff
and then when I go to wake up in the
morning I like literally can't even get
up but I could get up fine by myself and
I can do pretty much everything for
myself I did struggle to make a smoothie
this morning cuz I have that like
nutribullet and yeah I kind of struggled
it kind of felt a little bit - oh my god
it kind of felt a little bit like screw
it in but other than that I've been
pretty like independent today so I put
on this sports bra before I have my
surgery so I'm gonna pop it on again now
and see the difference I'm actually
super excited to see what my boobs are
gonna look like in this because yeah
before I got them done they just look so
like saggy and sad so I'm gonna pop this
on got this bar now holy shit look how
different it looks okay so this is just
a sports bra from culture kings I think
I might end this video here just because
I think the next three or so days will
be quite similar like I'll probably be
talking about the same thing
but yeah if you guys want to know like
any more information about them leave me
a comment in the comments down below and
I'll try to answer as many as I can but
thank you guys so much for watching this
vlog I hope it helped some of you guys
out put some of your guys's minds at
ease because like as you could see I was
super nervous but honestly it isn't as
bad as what I thought it would be I
thought I would be in like so much pain
for at least two weeks at home I'm fine
first day post-op was pretty bad like I
I was just like why did I do this I just
felt like ripping them out of my chest
because I was so uncomfortable I
couldn't sleep properly but other than
that like after that day it's been
amazing but yeah thank you guys so much
for watching don't forget to give a like
and let me know if you want to see more
boobie vlogs because I'll be more than
happy to film it for you guys and I will
