gal it's a brightening primer and I
wanted a really nice luminous base so
that is why I chose this one so I'm just
rubbing it all in with my hands and then
going ahead and using a stippling brush
then I'm grabbing the mac fix+ and just
spritzing that all over just to ensure
that the face is nice and moisturized
and hydrated then I'm mixing the dried
cosmetics bb+ illumination cream with
only one pump of the Mac Studio Fix
fluid
I used NC 37 and I'm just evenly dabbing
that all over a face
you
then for concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
as this is a really neutral beachy look
I just wanted to conceal straight
underneath her eyes just to brighten
that area up I didn't do any
highlighting or anything like that so I
just purely use this to conceal her
under eye area and then I just go in
with the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit and I'm just taking a mixture of the
banana shade and the lighter shade to
set that area in place
for highlighter I'm using the benefit
what's up and just placing that on with
a small kabuki style synthetic brush
placing that on the cheekbone area above
and below her brow bone then I go ahead
to place it on a Cupid's bow down the
bridge of a nose tip of her nose and on
her chin oh my god this highlighter is
life I need to use it more often I
always forget to use it but it's
definitely one of my favorite cream
highlighters
then taking the Australis fresh and
floors in the shade at darkest Brown I'm
just using that true set to a foundation
where I'm going to place the bronzer
just so it goes on it nice and
seamlessly if a bronzer i'm using the
bum betty loumanizer this is an
illuminating bronzer so so so pretty for
beachy and natural looks like this I
love it so so much then for blush I'm
using one of the new Marc Jacobs ones
I'm unsure of the color bra leave it
listed down below I'm just placing that
on the apples of her cheeks then I'm
going in with brows and I'm just using
my uh Nastasia Pro a brow palette which
needs a clean and I want to a really
light handed with this I didn't want to
shape them or anything I'm just simply
filling them in
you
then four-eyes I'm just using creme
brulee by makeup geek and I'm pretty
much applying that all over the lid then
going in with a mascara and just lightly
putting a coat on with a disposable
mascara wand then because the under eye
area started to create a bit I decided
to fake just with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder just slightly
underneath her eyes then after a few
minutes I'm brushing off the excess
powder then going in with a clear gloss
I'm just using the Rimmel o'my gloss and
just placing that all over elipse then
later on I decided I wanted a more pinky
tone so then I just went over top with
Giraud cosmetics of buttercup
then I'm just taking a little bit of the
benefit what's up and just placing that
on her lids I felt like it needed some
sort of color and this is where I am
applying the Gerard cosmetics Buttercup
lipstick then finally to set the face
I'm using the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and that is the final look
I hope you guys enjoyed this really
simple glowy beachy bronzy makeup look
