so I'm just gonna get straight into it
again I'm just spraying my face with the
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
then for foundation I'm going in with
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
in 220 and I mix that with a little bit
of the L'Oreal True Match
I'll leave the color down below cuz I'm
not quite sure what the color was
because I am a little bit on the paler
side than usual
um I actually haven't tan since Bali
what is wrong with me I did a little
barley tan but it's definitely not as
dark as I usually have it but I'm not
really fast I don't know why maybe I
will turn this week but I've just been
probably really lazy and busy
anyways so I've just put that foundation
on and then I'm buffing it in with a
damp Beauty Blender
so for concealer I'm using one of my new
favorites which is the and naked urban
decay naked weightless con sealer in the
ship I always forget the shades or leave
them listed down below I probably should
have them next to me it's like a normal
youtuber but I don't I'm just in my room
in my bed tucked in anyways I'm putting
that in the usual places and then I am
going in with the Judah hoola by benefit
which is an amazing cream bronzer oh my
god if you know me I'm not usually into
the whole cream contouring but this
product is amazing so I've just put that
in the hollows of my cheeks around my
forehead down at the sides of my nose
and underneath my lip and then obviously
on my jaw line and then I'm just
blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender
and then of course baking my under-eye
concealer with the laura mercier
translucent powder and I'm just using
that all need damp Beauty Blender and
then of course to set the rest of my
face i'm using the astrologer Shand
flawless face powder in a deep natural
so for brows I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow is in the shade
medium brown and I'm using that to fill
in my brows today and I actually really
enjoyed it I used to be obsessed with
these until I got hooked on the POE made
and then I don't know I just been using
a bunch of stuff lately so I don't
really have a like go-to brow products I
always use something new each time but
I'm definitely going to use this one
more often then taking that same
concealer I use underneath my eyes and
I'm using that on a concealer brush and
carving my brows out
and then to prime my eyelids I'm using
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I just
really want to finish this so I can use
it in the back too Mac program so I can
get a free lipstick so I need one more
thing to finish so I'm gonna try and
finish this ace up and then I'm just
setting the eyelids with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder just so it's
way way way easier for the eyeshadows to
glide and blend and then choose set Z
brows I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills clear brow gel it's frickin
amazing and then I thought I would try
this printing cosmetics brow pop it's
just kind of like a brow highlighter pen
and I actually quite enjoyed it center
bronze and contour amusing hoola by
benefit and before you guys say I use
the same every video I just think
that the drew the hoola and then the
powder hoola
is like the perfect duo like they work
really well together so I decided to use
them both but yeah I'm definitely trying
to use different products in every video
so stay tuned for that I'm not just
gonna use the same products but anyways
I'm just using that on a new bronzer
brush that just came out and then the
blush I'm using is the bomb hot mama and
it's so pretty it's got like a nice
sheen to it without it being like true
intense of a blush because I don't
really like intense blushes so I really
really love it and I love it for brides
I use it a lot for Bridal makeup and
then for highlight I'm using the Laura
Geller gilded honey and honestly this
highlighter is amazing like what dark
hell
so therefore the eyes I'm taking a creme
brulee by makeup geek cosmetics and I'm
using that in my crease and just a
little bit above my crease as the
transition shade and then I'm also
grabbing makeup geeks Coco bear and I'm
at placing that just above and in my
crease as well just because the navy
blue is gonna be pretty dark so you're
gonna need like a darker transition
shade so it blends all nicely and
seamlessly together you'll see what I
mean in a second yep and then I'm just
doing the other eye I thought that the
blue is coming up next it's not it's
coming it's coming
and then I'm grabbing the anasazi
Beverly Hills artist palette and I'm
grabbing that navy blue in the top right
hand corner just on a shader brush and
as you can see I'm just packing that
product all over the mobile lid try not
to go over the crease because that's
what we'll do later and we'll blend it
up so it doesn't look like you got
punched in the face girl or guy can't
forget the boys and then I'm just using
the first blending brush that we used
for the transition color and just
blending everything together as you can
see and blending a little bit above the
crease whoo slowly build up that smokey
eye effect so less is more so if you're
grabbing less product and blending it
out it's so much easier doing it that
way then grabbing heaps of product and
trying to blend it because that's when
it's just gonna look shocking so just
have to go a little by little so now I'm
just packing a little bit more of that
navy blue because we've lost a bit of
the color in the blending process so I'm
just placing that on the lid and then
I'll go in again with that blending
brush and blend the edges out
then just grabbing a new blending brush
this one's just from Jessup from eBay
and then I'm just using that to further
blend everything together
and then taking the uh necessity Beverly
Hills baby blue eyeliner I'm not
actually quite short the name is
probably have it listed down below and
I'm just using that in my waterline
because I wanted to do something a
little different and cray-cray to what I
usually do and I actually really liked
how it turned out and then I'm grabbing
the navy blue out of the artist palette
and I'm just using that on a tapered
blending brush and just using that to
smoke out the lower lash line then
taking Coco bear again I'm just using
that to help with the blending and then
I'm taking makeup geeks whimsical foiled
eyeshadow holy this is like my fave
at the moment and I'm using that to
highlight my inner corners and my brow
bone so amazing like look I was feeling
myself there and then I'm taking the
designer brands mascara which is one of
my favorite seriously it's really good
and affordable I'm using that to coat my
top and bottom lashes and then the
lashes that I'm actually wearing is a
secret so I can't tell you yet
but you'll definitely know within the
next couple of months but yeah I decided
to you know have a little sneak peek
actually I'm just going to tell you
they're like one of my samples for my
lash line I probably shouldn't be using
them but I really wanted to see what
they look like and I love them
so yes and now I am contouring my nose
because I forgot before and then I'm
using the Gerard cosmetics new nude lip
liner seriously these are amazing like
honestly one of the best lip liners I've
ever use and I'm not just saying that I
really really like them and then I'm
using the UH necessity of Beverly Hills
I'm pretty sure this is crush liquid
lipstick and then over the top I'm using
Kylie cosmetics like lip gloss which
I've been obsessed with recently like
I've been pretty much wearing it every
day it's like the best nude gloss ever
so pigmented not sticky love it and then
I'm just cleaning up my lip line with
the concealer brush and then because I
got a bit of fallout and my under eyes
looked a bit dark I'm just using the
Batman immoral but bareMinerals well
arrested concealer and this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
