so I'm just going to get straight into
it again I'm just using the that gal
primer by benefit cosmetics and I'm just
evenly distributing that all over her
face just with a stippling brush it's a
foundation today I use the L'Oreal
infallible 24 hour matte foundation and
this is in the shade vanilla I decided
to do something different for once
instead of using my Mac Studio Fix and I
really love this foundation it's
definitely one of my favorite drugstore
foundations super flawless super high
coverage and affordable
then to conceal her under eye area I'm
using the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade light it has all weight and
just plating that underneath her eyes
and then blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender
this man's got me
then again with the same concealer I'm
just popping that on her forehead down
the bridge of a nose Cupid's bow and
then on her chin and then of course
blending it all out
then for brows I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Pro brow palette and I'm
using that in the shade dark brown just
on my pony cosmetics eyebrow brush and I
like to start at the tail of the brow
and then work my way towards the start
of the brow and I tend to like to use a
lighter shade in the start just to give
that gradient effect
then going in with you Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light as well I'm
just using that on a makeup addictions
cosmetics concealer brush and as you can
see I'm just shaping the brows
then to Baker under eye area I'm using
the laura mercier translucent powder as
always it's my favorite translucent
powder ever and I'm just using that on
my damp Beauty Blender and then I
decided to use some to set the rest of
her face just because I didn't really
want to add extra coverage by using a
pressed powder and I really like how the
face turned out and then I'm just wiping
off the excess powder from the baked and
then I go ahead to start bronzing her
skin with the new Too Faced sweethearts
bronzer which I've been lately obsessed
with it's like such a gorgeous shade and
I went in with the hoola bronzer by
benefit just to contour her cheekbones
then tobacco contour i'm using the laura
mercier translucent powder again and i'm
just creating a line from the top of her
ear all the way to the side of her mouth
just on that same beauty blender as
before then for a subtle pop of color on
her cheeks i'm using the makeup geek
cosmetics spellbound blush and yeah I'm
just placing that on her cheeks and
swiping that all the way up through her
temples
then I'm just going ahead and removing
that excess powder from the bake just
with a large powder brush
then to highlight today I'm using the
new Anastasia Beverly Hills Sun dipped
glow kit and I used the shade on the
bottom I'm on the left
I'll leave the color listed down below
I'm pretty sure it's called moonstone or
moon shine but look how freakin amazing
this is I'm just placing that on her
cheekbones her Cupid's bow and then I
dot it a little bit on the tip of her
nose and then down the bridge of her
nose then I'm just setting her eyelids
to prevent the eyeshadow from creasing
and it just makes it easier to blend I'm
just using a translucent powder so for
eyeshadow I actually use the under stars
II Beverly Hills shadow Couture palette
but if you didn't want to buy the whole
palette she does have individual single
pants available so first up I'm taking
Morocco which is a gorgeous like burnt
orange e brown shade and I'm just
placing that into her crease
and then taking fudge also by anastasiya
Beverly Hills I'm just placing that in
the crease as well just so when I place
the black on the lid it's all just going
to blend seamlessly Perce I decided not
to forward like fast forward too much of
the video just so you can see like
exactly how I do it in real time it
usually takes me about 45 minutes to do
a full glam look I am pretty fast as
people have said but because I do it all
the time I've kind of like trained
myself so yeah then I'm taking noir by
Anasazi Beverly Hills this is my
favorite matte black eyeshadow that I
find doesn't go blue when you start to
blend it out makeup get corrupt is also
good but yeah I just find that sometimes
goes blue I don't know why maybe it's
not pigmented enough but this one is
amazing so as you can see I'm just using
a tissue to prevent any fallout from
happening and just packing that black
all over the lid
and then I'm going in with the Mac - one
seven brush and basically blending at my
life away it took me like five minutes
to like do this perfectly but obviously
I didn't put it all in the video but
yeah just keep on blending adding the
transition color to diffuse lines just
yeah just keep blending when in doubt
blend but make sure you don't go above
the crease because that's when it's
going to look yeah like you got punched
so could you win
then going in with my favorite gel liner
which is the Maybelline eye studio in
black and I'm just using that to line
her waterline and then because I want to
do the lower lash line to be extra
dramatic I decided to put a little bit
more of the eye studio gel liner
directly underneath her one lighter then
when we go and smoke it out it's going
to be extra dark and smoky
then grabbing fudge on a zoeva tapered
brush I'll leave all the brushes I use
down below and I'm just using that to
smoke out the lower lash line then I'm
going in with this like narrow we typed
blending brush I got it from eBay so
I'll leave a link down below and I'm
just using that with no product on it
just to further blend
then I'm taking whimsical foiled
eyeshadow by makeup geek and using that
to highlight her inner corners and then
I decided to go ahead and intensify her
Cupid's bow highlight and just popped a
bit on her nose as well then for mascara
I'm just using the benefit roller lash
on one of my disposable mascara wands
that I got from eBay I use silicon based
ones as opposed to like the generic
cheaper ones I'll leave a link down
below where I buy them from as well
then four lashes I'm using the dirty
lashes in the style day 105 and just
placing them on her eyelids just with
the jewel lash glue the eyelash band was
actually really thick and it was really
hard to apply so don't know if I would
100% recommend these I just thought I
would give them a go because they got
them sent to me but yeah I think that
they look really nice and not too over
the top for like mink lashes if you know
what I mean and then I'm just quoting
the lower lashes just with the same
mascara wand then for lip liner I'm
using the Gerard cosmetics nude liner
I've gone through two of these I'm like
obsessed with it I pretty much use it on
everyone that wants a nude lip it's
amazing
I'll leave a link and discount code down
below if you guys interested I wanted to
do like an ombre lip but it kind of
failed and just looked all the same
color but I went around the corners with
velvet teddy and then in the middle I
put mith both by Mac on and then when I
blended them together it just looked
like one color so I was like oh that was
pointless but oh well and then over the
top of that I just put a clear gloss on
and I'm pretty sure the one that I used
was the Rimmel Born This Way gloss I'll
leave everything was to down below
anyways if I got it wrong
and then lastly I'm just spritzing her
face with the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and this is the final look
I hope you guys enjoyed watching learn
