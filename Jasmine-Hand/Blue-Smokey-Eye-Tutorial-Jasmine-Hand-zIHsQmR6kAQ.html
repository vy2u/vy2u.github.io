brulee by makeup geek as a transition
color and buffing that into my crease
and then I'm going to be grabbing a
cocoa bear which is just more of a rich
sort of brown color and also bugging
that into my crease just to make it look
a little bit more defined and darker so
now I'm darkening the crease up a little
bit more with maca by makeup geek also
popping that into my crease and kind of
working it into the upper crease area
just so when I put the glue on the lid
it can blend flawlessly together so now
I'm taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
shadow Couture palette and just
spritzing my brush first with a little
bit of fix+ and going in with that
gorgeous blue color and just packing
that all over my lid trying not to go
above the crease
now I'm just taking a large blending
brush and blending the blue into the
brown just so it looks flawless and
seamless so now I'm going in with the
Mac blue brown pigment and oh my god
this is stunning on the lid you can buy
these from only Mac Pro stores I believe
you don't need a Mac Pro cut or anything
like that to buy it and then I'm just
blending everything together and then
I'm going in with the Engler 77 gel
liner I really like this liner because
it's really creamy and black but the
only thing I don't like about it is that
it dries really quickly you'll see what
I mean like it goes really like crumbly
I don't know if it's just me or if
anyone else has experienced that let me
know in the comments below but yeah
that's the only thing I don't like about
is that it dries so quick and it looks
so crumbly anyways I'm doing a wing so
I'm just mapping out the wing first and
then filling it all in as you can see
so I just quickly did my waterline I
just use the Inglot eyeliner as well I
probably would have poked myself in the
eye if I did it on camera I'm so I'm
just taking mock eye and smoking that on
my lower lashline and then I'm taking
shimmer shimmer by makeup geek and
highlighting my inner corner and brow
bone so for lashes I'm using the Vegas
nay I lower shining star lashes you can
only get these online I'll leave the
link down below where I purchased them
from I think there are about $8 or
whatever but they are amazing they're
double layered and ahh they just look
incredible okay so for lips I use the
Macworld lip liner and then I went over
the top with Geoffrey start celebrity
skin which is a liquid lipstick and then
I went over that with the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills buttercup lip gloss
so there you have it I hope you guys
enjoyed this quick simple tutorial don't
forget to give it a like and subscribe
and I'll see you next time Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
