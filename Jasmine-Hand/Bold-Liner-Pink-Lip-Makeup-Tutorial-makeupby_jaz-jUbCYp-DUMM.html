so today I decided to do a first
impressions full face of makeup sort of
video everything I use will pretty much
99% of everything I used was for the
first time so if you'd like to see how I
creator then please keep watching
so for primer I'm going to use the Nivea
men sensitive post shave balm don't
nikkietutorials has recently been raving
about this saying that it is an amazing
Pro because it has glycerine in it
apparently and that's what makes your
foundation stick does drive very very um
Matt and like sticky so I'm gonna use a
little bit of fix plus all over my face
I'm thinking I might use the Maybelline
Dream wonder foundation by the way this
in the color creamy natural so I'm gonna
pop this in with my zoeva look finish
brush this isn't the first time that
I've used it I love this brush it's
actually a silk finish brush like it
leaves my face you can see how I'm going
to use the Maybelline Dream Lumi touch
highlighting concealer I've never uses
before
I'm just going to set my under eye area
with my face with Australia loose powder
so I'm going to set the rest of my face
with the in aqsa skin perfecting baby
powder five in one in the color age so
I'm going to use the Maybelline Dream
Sun bronzing powder I've never used
before either and I'm going to take it
on the bush I don't know if it's like a
powder brush but it looks pretty small
it's like to contour I'm going to use
the contouring palette in black medium
also by Maybelline it looks a little bit
too light for my skin now that I'm ten
but I'm going to give it a go anyway I'm
going to use the highlighting shade from
it as well on my Jessup tapered
highlighter or this harlot is so nice
you probably see me doing this and so
many of my videos so I'm just using the
same face in Australia and on a angled
sponge I'm just creating a line from the
top of my ear to my mouth but I'm not
actually going to go all the way down to
my mouth so while my contour is baking
I'm going to use the Bush eyebrow brush
with the Australis oh hi
I'm just gonna use a bit of this sort of
homemade gel stuff to extend my brow
because I wasn't it and cut my brow so
to set my brows I'm going to use this
model comb or browse thing in light to
medium and it's kind of like a dupe for
the benefit gimme brow and I've recently
been enjoying and it's not the first
time I've used it I guess I'm gonna
brush off this baked for blush only
something different so this is the
Stephan cheek blush in the shade so I'm
just going to use a transition shade
first I'm just going to use my chocolate
bar the peanut solid shade so I'm going
to use these two eyeshadow palettes one
is the anak sir daytime neutrals and the
other one is the model Co eyeshadow trio
in Arabian Nights I'm going to use the
middle color and place it on the outer
corner of my eye I'm gonna use the
darker color now which is sort of like a
black
shimma shimma by makeup geek and place
that on my brow bones okay so I'm going
to put some Mac blackjack eyeliner in my
waterline I'm just going to use my
mary-lou to highlight my inner corners
for the star I'm going to use the pony
cosmetics the white night mascara but
first I'm going to curl my lashes if it
lashes I'm going to use the Megan Elise
mink lashes these are in this style Koko
Elise luxe they look amazing okay so I'm
gonna pop these lashes on I'm going to
use this lip liner in cappuccino and
it's by the brand full lips the same
brand as my lip enhancer and it's just a
new brown I'm gonna go over this
lipstick with these lips lip gloss in I
don't 106 is the color
