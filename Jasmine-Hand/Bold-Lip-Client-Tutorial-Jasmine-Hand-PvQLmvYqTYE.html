get straight into it I'm starting off
with the prep spray by Urban Decay which
is new and then for brows I'm going in
with the benefit browsing in the shade 4
and taking the pomade type side which is
the left side firstly though I am just
brushing her brows just to make sure all
the hairs are in place and then yet just
filling in her brows
then was taking a light concealer and
just using that to define above and
below the browser actually really really
loved how her brows turned out with the
PO makes I haven't actually used up like
side of the brow palette before so yeah
very very impressed then also taking the
Benefit Cosmetics 3d brow tones and just
running that through her brow to set
them in place then taking a mixture of
the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
liquid in opal and Mac Studio Fix and MC
35 and popping that all over her face as
her base and blending it all in with a
damp Beauty Blender
then taking the heart-shaped concealer
in light medium and just placing that
underneath her eyes to conceal and
highlight then going ahead and placing
on our chin that keep its ferb forehead
and down the bridge of her nose and then
blending it out
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder and just using that
underneath her eyes to set the concealer
in place then taking the Too Faced sweet
peach palette I'm taking the shade I
think it's called yep summer young and
just using that as a transition color I
kind of just like pretty much put this
everywhere cuz I wanted this color to be
nicely blown out so I'm just using that
on a large fluffy brush and yeah
basically putting that all over
then taking the top right color
I think it's called charmed I'm sure
it's not and that's awkward literally
what I just read and I'm just pretty
much using that in the crease as well
just kind of going over the same areas
as we did with the last color just to
make it a little bit more kind of cool
toned when I first saw girls okay I want
this look to be a little bit on the
cooler tone side so I always do warm
tone looks and so far it's looking like
a warm turn dye but I literally can't
help it I just think it looks amazing
anyway taking that purpley color I
wasn't really that impressed with it so
I went over it with that color there I
can't even read the names it's going too
fast I'm just to lighten and brighten it
up a bit just for the inner corner area
I kind of wanted it to be like a dark
sort of eye but yeah so I just mix those
two colors to the inner corner and then
I'm just wiping away the excess
translucent powder from underneath her
eyes
now I'm just grabbing a matte black
eyeshadow I'm pretty sure I used corrupt
by makeup geek and I'm just really
pressing that into the lash line and
then blending it out there's a bottom
lash line I'm going into same colors we
use at the top so I'm using summer young
and then the one next to it just
underneath just on this brush which I
have no frickin clue where I got it from
it has no name on it so I'm so sorry and
then I'm going in with the UH Nastasia
waterproof cream color in jet which is
just black and using that to line her
waterline then going in with a matte
black eyeshadow again just on there
I think it's an honest Asya brush and
I'm just really working that into the
lower lash line kind of connecting that
to the gel from the waterline just to
make it extra smoky and then using that
same brush that we used earlier to smoke
it all together then taking these same
liner and just using that on the top I
didn't do a wing or anything I wanted to
keep it fairly basic so yeah I'm just
creating a nice thin line on the top
since the inner corner highlight I'm
using the Geoffrey size called
highlighter which I need to buy another
of because mine smashed everywhere
anyways but yeah everyone always asked
me and that is what I love it and then
just going in with some mascara before
falsies just on a disposable mascara
wand and then wiping off the excess
powder from I kind of like to sharpen up
the sides of the eyeshadow with
translucent pattern sort of concealer
I just find it looks less cakey around
there
then taking these lashes from harvard
boutique oh I forgot what style it's in
but I'll leave it listed down below and
just placing that on her eyes and then
I'm just sitting the rest of her face
with the Austral as fresh and flawless
face powder in the shade medium tan and
just dabbing that all over then going in
with one of my favorite bronzers a Too
Faced sweethearts one and using that on
a spectrum Cosmetics angled brush my two
faves for bronzing and then I'm taking
the UH Nastasia contour kit I think I'm
just taking fawn and just really using
that to sculpt out the cheeks and also
the jaw line as well
you
then taking the Laura Mercier powder
again and just using that to define her
contour so just creating a line directly
underneath from the top of her ear to
the side of her mouth
then for blush I'm taking max Melba and
just popping that on her cheeks and then
a highlighter I'm taking at the new
anastacio and Nicole is it Guerrero I'm
so bad with pronouncing names but her
glow kit and I'm taking the middle shade
which is the gold and oh my god so
obsessed with this palette I pretty much
have been using it non-stop lately so
I'm just placing that on her cheekbones
and then I go ahead to place it on a
Cupid's bow to the her nose and then a
little bit down lip on the bridge as
well to line her lips I'm taking the
Urban Decay 24-hour glide on lip pencil
in the shade at venom and yeah lining
her lips I really want to do a dark lip
and I think she pulled it off so amazing
or she pulls off any look because she's
absolutely gorgeous so yeah just lining
her lips then taking these Stila stay
all day liquid lipstick in the shade
note and filling in her lips with this
the pigmentation of these liquid
lipsticks are amazing I'm not sure if
it's just this color but it was a little
bit patchy so I had to do two layers but
otherwise I love this color and how it
looked with the eyes
then just setting with the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray and that is
the final look done I hope you guys
