in today's video I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A I
haven't done one of these on my channel
in literally like 6 months or something
so I decided to sit down and answer some
of your questions so I'm gonna go onto
my Instagram photo that I put up how
will you go down two weeks ago I haven't
had much time to film over the past
couple of weeks because I've been
travelling heaps I've been busy with
makeup and clients and yeah it's just
been so hectic but I'm gonna sit down
and pre film a lot of videos from when
I'm in Europe I'm going when I can Tiki
at the end of November for a month
around Europe with my best friend he is
not my boyfriend I've had so many people
ask like oh my god is that good on your
site your boyfriend no he's my gay best
friend so I just want to clear that up
right now for you guys that are asking
ok so I'm gonna go up and and system of
your Q's ok so the first question comes
from Rhiannon and she asked what my
all-time favorite drugstore foundation
or ones that you would recommend I would
definitely have to say the covergirl
three-in-one foundation it's so
underrated I never hear anyone talk
about it seriously it's only $20 from
Priceline not on sale and when it is on
sale you can probably grow it for like
11 to $15 I literally have every shade
times 3 in my drawer because I love to
mix and match point on Ted but I'm not
tagged I just love the foundation you
need it in your life
so we've got Redell asked if I could
live off one makeup brand what would it
be I would probably have to say I just
started Beverly Hills but they don't
have any foundations or primers or
anything like that but if they did come
out with foundations which I'm sure they
are I think I saw an Instagram and
they're like coming out with stick
foundations or something but yeah I
would have to say anastasi Beverly Hills
lip Morris underscore ass who my
favorite youtubers are I only really
watch Beauty related channels so like
Shen ik so nikkietutorials desi Perkins
crispy lust deluxe all of those amazing
American Beauty youtubers but I also do
occasionally like to watch PewDiePie I
know I'm not into games or anything like
that but I think he's just hot and
hilarious so I like to watch him from
time to time but yeah mainly just makeup
related channels Kol like her ass if you
had to pick one product that you could
use for the rest of your life on
everything what would it be example if
you choose lipstick you'd have to use it
as a blush eyeliner eyeshadow etc I
think I've answered this question in one
of my videos before but I would
definitely pick bronzer because you can
use it to bronze fill in your brows
eyeshadow turn it into an eyeliner
lipstick I don't know but I would
definitely choose bronzer Meghan's front
asks how old do you have to be to do
freelancing makeup and how old were you
when you started I don't think there's
any age where you can start freelancing
just whatever you feel comfortable I
guess I started when I was 18 years old
though Bridey Fritz underscore asked do
you have a boyfriend and then it just
says all your past boyfriends I don't
give a about my past boyfriends
because they're all moles and no I don't
have a boyfriend at the moment make
Blair underscore ask my funniest
highschool story okay so this was what I
was in grade 8 I think so my first year
of high school so at my school where I
went to there was a common room and that
was for all of the grade 12 to like hang
out and stuff and all the younger grades
thought it was like cool to walk past
them because there was probably a hot
guys in there or something anyways so
that was like a path and then there's
the common room and then there was like
classrooms or whatever so me and my
friends were walking along the path and
I don't know it will just being silly
and there was like big pot plants next
to the paths and what I did was I didn't
even look where I was going I literally
was running spastically or whatever and
I went in headfirst into the pot plant
my skirt went over my head and every
single grade 12 but I swear someone
hundies and I'm pretty sure I had my
period so that was probably the most
humiliating time of my life
but now that I look back at it it was
probably one of the funniest moments
that I can remember in my
and I'll remember it forever and my
friends still never will forget it
Allisyn 102 9 asks have you ever
finished a lipstick to be honest I don't
think I have I'm pretty close to
finishing two lipsticks I think I have
like this much left of my MAC lipsticks
but no that's an actually interesting
question I haven't it's Emily my ass
believe it IMAX and if so can we have a
nice little chat of course we can
because yes I am going to I'm at I don't
know if I'm gonna go the full two days
but I'll definitely be there on the
Saturday so yeah it come up and say hi
if you are there here i underscore
Bayliss 1 1 2 4 ask what my favorite
song is at the moment and I would
definitely have to say sorry by Justin
Bieber Michaela underscore flitter asked
what causes did you do in order to
become a qualified makeup artist I'm not
a qualified makeup artist I'm completely
self-taught miss Louise may I ask how
much do you charge for formal makeup I
charge $100 with lashes I decided to
answer this question because I literally
get this question on every single one of
my Instagram posts and and I kind of
feel uncomfortable publicly answering
people's questions I don't know because
I think prices are like kind of personal
and rather they've asked me privately
but I just thought I would share it in
this video because I just get so many
questions asking so back Demasi ask what
bred of liquid lipstick that you've
tried out is your least favorite I
definitely have to say the Australis the
little lips range I don't know I just
feel like when I put them on and they
dry they kind of just feel like they're
flaking off I don't know I just don't
like them so we don't read l us what
high school did I go to I went to
Somerset College I'm on the Gold Coast T
underscore Beauty asks would you ever
think of making your own brand of makeup
or brushes or eyelashes the answer is
yes I've actually been looking into
making my own eyelash line
but I'm hopefully gonna piss you that
next year because I have so much
happening this year already I've always
wanted to come out with my own eye
lashes because it's really really hard
to find good quality thick fluffy eye
lashes that are inexpensive so fingers
crossed that that's going to have
next year martini asks what's my
favorite bronzer if you guys can't
already guess it's definitely the hall
up I benefit by far my favorite runs up
forever I just actually recently
purchased the Mackay me son
nah don't like it compared to hula it's
just a tad too orange for me I think it
would work more on people with darker
like complexions but all of my benefit
best bronzer ever makeup Beauty 87 ours
best under eye setting powder that isn't
cakey I would definitely say the Laura
Mercier translucent powder I think I've
said this so many times but it feels
like silk underneath your eyes it
doesn't make your concealer crease lasts
all day it is amazing I would highly
recommend that one ta-dah makeup us
would you rather use all drugstore or
high-end makeup products if I had to
choose I would definitely go drugstore I
think I like more drugstore products and
high-end products it is very rare that I
do use high-end products my most Jews
high-end product well it's not really
high-end it's something like 50 dollars
is my hauler by Benefit bronzer but if I
had to use drugstore products for the
rest of my life I would be happy to so
high-end products mmm they just look
pretty bori foot ask where did you learn
to do makeup here on YouTube I just
watched a millions and millions and
millions of makeup tutorials practice
practice practice on myself practice on
my friends seriously guys
practice makes perfect you can do
anything that you put your mind to
honestly just keep practicing that's all
I can say to you guys that are just
starting out with makeup wanting to
become a freelance makeup artist just
practice I think that's enough questions
for today's video I will definitely try
and upload a Q&amp;amp;A every few months
because they're pretty fun to film and
if you'd like to see more don't forget
