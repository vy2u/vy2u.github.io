off with brows I'm taking the benefit
cut brow in the shade number three and
just using my pony cosmetics eyebrow
brush just to fill in her brows
then taking my favorite concealer
Maybelline fit me in the shade like and
just using that to cop out the brow so I
just place that above and below then
I'll just play some more of that
concealer over her whole eyelid just to
act as a base and then blending it all
out and then setting it all in with the
Rimmel stay matte translucent powder
then I'm just setting her brows with the
benefit clear brow gel and then onto
eyes I'm taking the modern renaissance
palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
taking this Shay which is just a light
lilac color and using that in the crease
as a transition then I'm taking Cyprus
amber which is just a dark matte brown
and just working that on the outer
corners of the eyes and slowly building
up the color
then I'm taking the subculture power and
taking the matte black and also using
that to intensify the outer corners of
her eyes then taking the true face gold
chocolate palette I'm taking at this
shimmery shade right here and just
placing that on her inner corners then
taking the new mary jewmonized pretty
sure that's what it's called it's kind
of like the mary lou but in a liquid
form and I'm just placing that on her
lids as well just to create that
metallic II sort of vibe
then I'm just taking some masala water
and just cleaning up the excess fallout
from below the eyes and just cleaning up
the edges then I'm taking the tightest
clay at paint liner in black and just
using that to create a really thin line
on her lash line then just taking some
mascara on a disposable mascara wand and
coating her lashes and then I decided to
do individual lashes this time for a
more natural sort of look so these
months adjust the medium and then I used
a mixture of the long ones as well from
model rock and these are the double
knotted ones as well so I'll just use
some joy lash glue and just stuck them
on individually
now I'm taking the benefit pearl
Porefessional primer and popping that
all over her face to prime her skin then
spraying her face with some mac fix+ and
then for foundation I'm taking one of my
favorites at the moment is the NARS
natural radiance foundation and it is in
the shade Punjab and yeah I'm just
running it all over then I'm taking the
Tarte rainforest of the sea radiance
drops and just dropping that on her face
just to give her face a little bit more
radiance as the product suggests and
yeah just for a more natural sort of
look and yeah just buffing that all in
with a damp Beauty Blender
then going in with the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and just
popping that underneath her eyes Cupid's
bow at down the bridge of her nose a bit
on her chin a little bit on her forehead
and then blending it all in then using
the Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm
just using that to bake underneath her
eyes just to ensure her concealer
doesn't crease throughout the day and
taking the estrela's fresh and flawless
face powder I'm just kind of using that
to brush off the excess powder from
underneath the eyes and just going over
the oïleus sort of area so down the
bridge of her nose chin and a little bit
above her brows then going back in with
the modern renaissance palette I'm
taking the lilac color and using that as
the first color to smoke out her lower
lash line
then taking Cypress Umba which is the
matte Brown and I'm also working that in
her lower lashline
then taking the Australia's metallics
cream eyeshadow this one's just the
white one I'm not sure of what the
colors called but they only have three
different colors and I usually use this
for inner corners just because it's so
pigmented and I just love a bright inner
corner highlight so yeah just placing
that in the inner corners of her eyes
then for bronzer I'm taking a mixture of
the Too Faced sweetheart and the C arte
a London South Beach bronzer and using
that true at bronze up her face
then I'm taking the benefit hoola
bronzer just to contour a face and I
like using the brush that comes with and
yes sculpting out her cheekbones with it
then using the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit I'm taking the middle shade
and just further using that in the
hollows of her cheeks just for a little
bit more definition
but I'm taking some more of the laura
mercier translucent powder and using
that directly underneath the contour to
make that area just to make it a little
bit more defined then using the Milani
baked blush in the shade luminoso ace
uses all the time but I just stopped
using it for some weird reason because
it is literally one of my favorite
blushes it looks so good on everyone's
skin type and skin tone so I'm just
putting that on her cheeks and then I'm
just brushing away the excess powder
from underneath the contour then taking
one of the most blinding highlights
I own the Ofra cosmetics Rodeo Drive and
just placing that on the highest points
of her cheekbones on her Cupid's bow and
down the bridge of her nose as well
that I'm just putting some more mascara
on her top and bottom just to merge her
real lashes with the false ones that we
put on
then in the planner I used was literally
one that I use pretty much every time
the shirt will lip line up by Gerard
cosmetics I have a little discount code
if you guys are interested in the
description box down below and then for
lips I'm taking at the Tarte cosmetics I
can't remember what the name is but I'll
definitely leave it listed down below
it's from their rainforest of the sea
collection it's so beautiful and so
Bridal appropriate this is typically the
shade that most Brides like request or
go for on their days so yeah I'm just
putting that all over and I like to go
over it with the gloss and my favorite
one is the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar
then to set our face I'm going in with
the glam glow glow set a setting spray
