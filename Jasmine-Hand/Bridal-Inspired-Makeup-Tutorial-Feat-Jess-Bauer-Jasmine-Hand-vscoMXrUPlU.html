so I'm going to get straight into it so
first I'm just going in with the Garnier
micellar water just all over our face
just to ensure that absolutely
everything is off before moisturizing
and then I'm just going in with a
moisturizer the one that I use is by the
brand Ren and it's just a daily
moisturizer so I'm just putting that all
over her face then after a few minutes I
just wait for the moisturizer to really
seep into the skin before priming and
then for primer I'm using the Too Faced
hangover primer just because Jess said
she kind of suffers from drier skin so
I'm putting that on and then I'm going
in with brows I'm just taking the UH
Nastasia Pro brow kit and using the
shade soft brown to lightly fill in her
brows
then just taking some light concealer
this is the Maybelline fit me in the
shade light I'm just using that on a
concealer brush to define the brows
then just going in with the same
maybelline fitme concealer and just
using that on her eyelids to act as a
primer
then I'm just spraying a face with a bit
of mac fix+
and then the foundation I use was a
mixture of Mac Studio Fix and NC 35 and
the tight Amazonian clay foundation in
the shade tan sand so I'm just buffing
that all over her face with a damp
Beauty Blender
then using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light I'm using
that underneath her eyes to conceal and
highlight and then I go ahead to blend
it all out with a damp Beauty Blender
then I'm placing it on her forehead down
the bridge of her nose Cupid's bow and
chin to highlight the center of her face
and then of course blending it all out
with the damp Beauty Blender as well
then to bake her
under-eye area I'm using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and just
packing that directly underneath her
eyes and then I'm just placing some more
of that translucent powder on her
eyelids to set the concealer in place
just so the eyeshadow blend a lot more
seamlessly and then I'm setting the rest
of her face with the Mac mineralized
skinfinish in medium plus I'm just on a
big large powder brush onto eyes I'm
going in with creme brulée by makeup
geek and just using that in her crease
as her first transition shade I'm just
taking that on a really large fluffy
brush
then I'm taking frappe also by makeup
geek and using that in the crease as
well just to make it a little bit more
defined and a deeper then taking the uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills master palette by
Mario I'm taking a Violeta which is the
most amazing brown shade ever and I'm so
depressed that I've hit pan on it
because I don't know if it sells
individually I'll check it out anyways
but I'm just mainly putting that in the
outer corners of the eyes
now I'm taking shimma shimma by makeup
geek and just packing that on the inner
corners of her eyes
then I'm just wiping away the excess
powder from the under I bake so now I'm
just using the same shades we used on
the top so I'm using creme brulee frappe
by makeup geek and then I'm also
smudging the violator shade from the
makeup by Mario palette on her lower
lash line then just using an angled
wedge I'm just using that to sharpen up
the eyeshadow and then I'm going in with
lighter I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills jet waterproof liquid liner and
I'm just creating a wing
you
the lashes I used were they model rock -
one - they like my favorite style I
pretty much use them on every single
client and I just use that with the duo
lash glue then I'm using the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer to bronze up her
face I actually just realized I forgot
to show the products and that I was
using oops but I'll definitely leave
them a listed down below for you guys so
just bronzing up her face and then I'm
taking all up by benefit as well and use
that to contour and then I'm just taking
some more of that transition powder and
using that to bake her contour then
taking the balm hot mama blush and using
that on the apples of her cheeks
that I'm taking the new Mac holiday
highlighter palette I can't remember
which one it's called bro leave it
listed down below and just using that to
highlight the highest point of her face
so
on her cheekbones cheekbones Cupid's bow
and on the tip of her nose
Philip lotta I'm using the gerard
cosmetics nude lipliner as you already
know if you watch my videos you know
they're like my favorite lip liners ever
they're so creamy and so easy to apply
I have literally gone through about
three or four of these on my clients
they're so good and then the lipstick I
used was faux by Mac which is literally
one of the most popular bridal shades
ever I use it all the time
so this is a final look I loved how it
turned out and I hope you guys did too I
can't wait to do Jessa's makeup on her
wedding day it's going to be so amazing
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
