today's video is going to be a bridal
makeup tutorial featuring Brooklyn again
you probably already recognize her from
another one of my tutorials on my
channel I just wanted to say I lost the
footage of me putting the primer
Foundation and concealer on but I've
done Brooklyn's makeup before uploaded
it onto YouTube so check out that video
if you want to see how I do the
foundation primer and concealer but yeah
those are the products that I use as you
can see on the screen so I just use
benefit Porefessional then spreader
faced with the Gerrard
lay all day setting spray then I used
Mac Studio Fix in NC 37 and then
Maybelline fit me in light to conceal
and highlight underneath her eyes
forehead bridge of a nose Cupid's bow
and chin and then I'm just blending it
out and this is where the footage
actually started I have no idea what
happened but I'm really really sorry and
so now I'm just baking her concealer
underneath her eyes with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder just on these
same damp Beauty Blender and then I'm
going in and setting the rest of our
face with the Australis fresh and
flawless face powder in it darkest Brown
and then after setting a fades as you
can see I'm just wiping off that excess
translucent powder from the bake so to
bronze and contour i'm using the hoola
benefit bronzer and obviously I didn't
want to do a harsh contoured look so I
wanted to try and keep it as soft and
natural as possible so I didn't you know
go in and bake underneath there or
anything all I did was just use the
spectrum Cosmetics angled I'm pretty
sure it's a blush brush or a bronzer
brush I'm not quite sure because they're
not labeled as you can see I'm just
placing that in the hollows of her
cheekbones on her jaw on her temples
around her forehead and then underneath
her lip underneath her chin and then I
go in to contour a nose with a makeup
addictions cosmetics brush I'm not sure
what it's called I'll have a link down
below though but you can see what I'm
doing
and then for blush I'm using the Milani
baked blush in Luminoso and just placing
that on her cheeks up to her temples
this is literally the best blush in the
world I think it's my favorite and it's
so affordable as well and then for
highlighter I'm using mary lou manizer
by the balm and just placing that
basically everywhere not really but if I
could I would but I'm just placing that
on her cheekbones bridge of her nose tip
of a nose just underneath her brow bone
and a her Cupid's bow and then I'm doing
her brows firstly I'm just brushing them
out with the Pony cosmetics brush and
then I'm going in with the Anasazi
Beverly Hills Pro brow palette and I'm
using the shade soft brown and really
lightly filling in her brows her brows
are so amazing naturally so I didn't
really do much to them because I don't
need it and then I'm just putting some
brow gel on this is the Rimmel Born This
Way clear brow gel and yet
so the eyeshadow palette that I'm going
to be using is the original toddler
palette and I've been recently so
obsessed with this I've pretty much used
it on every single client so I'm just
grabbing the transition shade called
force of nature and I'm just using that
to buff in her crease then I'm taking
free spirit which is a matte white Shea
and just using that on a eyes shadow
packing brush and focusing that mainly
on the inner corners of the eyes and
you're going to hate me again but I did
lose a little bit of the footage of me
putting dreamer in the outer corners of
the eye so I'm just kind of finishing up
on that so all I did was just put that
matte brown color in the outer corners
and just blending it out so it looks
seamless
then I'm just taking Marylou and just
using that underneath her brow bone and
on her inner corners then taking dreamer
again and I'm just using that on her
lower lashline I'm not making it too
heavy or anything but just so there's a
little bit of color on the bottom so
that's what I decided to do so I decided
to do a little how-to segment because
heaps of you have requested like a
little video or tutorial on how I do
lashes on other people so I hope this
helps so first I like to coat the lashes
with a little bit of mascara and then
what you need is some lash glue tweezers
and scissors I use the House of lashes
lash glue and I absolutely love the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills tweezers and just
any cosmetic scissors will do so first
what you have to do is measure the lash
to the eye shape there's nothing worse
than me seeing lashes that don't fit
like people's eyes you can see that it's
way way too long I've actually seen
girls where they've had their lashes too
long and they've actually stuck the lash
to their skin on the corner of their
eyes so you have to make sure you
measure the lash to the clients eye
shape there after measuring the lash I
found that I've needed to cut around 90%
of my clients lashes just because
they're way too long for their eye shape
and a big mistake that I see makeup
artists and girls doing their own makeup
make is cutting the lash from the inner
corner as opposed to the outer corner so
when you cut the lash from the inner
corner as you can see like the gradient
from short to long will just cut off so
if you cut it from the outer corner
there will be no like gradient cut off
if that makes any sense at all but trust
me I used to cut it off from the like
the inner corner rather than the outer
corner and it looked ridiculous
and I didn't realize until maybe like
two years ago however making sense I'm
not the best at explaining things but
then the neck
step is to coat the lash in lash glue
obviously and as I said before I use the
house of lashes lash glue I just find
that that glue literally is like
superglue it is amazing and I buy it
from the house of lashes website
directly and step four is probably one
of the most important steps when
applying false lashes it's going to make
your life so much easier if you just
wait thirty Seconds to a minute
after applying the glue on the lash
before you actually put it onto your eye
just because the glue has become more
tacky and it just makes it so much
easier for it to stick rather than just
putting it on straight away fiddling
around messing around until the glue
dries because then that's a disaster
I've done it like that for years trust
me I've been through that but seriously
just wait thirty seconds and your lash
game will be strong trust me
and finally Step five applying the
lashes so usually I just apply them
straight in the middle and then I just
use the tweezers to stick down both the
inner and outer corner and then I just
use the other end of the tweezers to
really push the fake eyelashes into the
real lashes if that makes any sense well
I hope you guys enjoyed that mini
eyelash tutorial so now on to lips I'm
using the new Gerard cosmetics nude lip
liner I have a discount code down below
for those that are interested they're
amazing they're so creamy so pigmented
love the colors on my god dying for them
and then the lipstick I'm using is the
Buttercup Gerard cosmetics lipstick as
well just placing that on it's probably
one of the most popular Bridal colors
and then over the top I'm just using a
Mac lip gloss
and then to finish the look off I'm just
using a little bit more of the mascara
and I'm just putting that on the bottom
lashes and then I decided she needed
more highlights so we're just going in
with some more Marylou and oh my god
look how good that looks
dying it looks amazing and so this is
the final look for the soft Bridal
makeup look so now I'm going to move on
to what changes I would make to make it
a little bit more glam
so for the eyes I'm just using the same
palette and I'm taking multitasker and
I'm just placing that on the outer
corners of her eyes just to make it a
little bit more dramatic and darker just
over the top of the previous eyeshadow
by the way how much better is this
lighting I wish I use this previously
but that's alright I'm always trying to
make new improvements so yeah I'm just
using that on a blending brush and just
blending blending blending until it's
all seamless
then I'm just grabbing some concealer
this is just the Maybelline fit me in
the shade light and I'm just cleaning up
the edges then taking multitasker again
I'm just darkening her lower lash line
up a little bit and yeah I'm just
smoking that out and then I decided to
pop a wing on because who doesn't love a
good wing I'm using the Tarte clay paint
liner on the Sigma winged liner brush
and as you can see I'm doing her winged
liner
I love winged liner
by the way I change the lashes too I use
the model rock to 1to lashes and now for
lips I'm just lining it with a Australis
lip liner I forgot the color I'll leave
it listed down below and then over the
top of that I'm using vintage rose by
Gerard cosmetics and then over the top
I'm just using a clear Mac lip gloss so
that is the end of the tutorial I hope
you guys liked both looks and don't
forget to comment down below which look
you liked the most
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys
