so today I did a bridal inspired makeup
tutorial this is the look I do on 99.9%
of my bride so if you'd like to know how
I did it then please keep watching
so first up I start off with a primer of
course and priming is one of the most
important thing for Bridal makeup
because you want the makeup to stay on
as long as possible
the primers that I use on my brides is
the hourglass feel primer because it is
sweat proof it makes the foundation go
on so easily and it is just amazing I
use it every day and I absolutely love
it I don't do this step every day
because I sometimes forget but now I'm
just filling in my pores using the
benefit Porefessional it really really
does help to fill in the pores that I
have around my nose area and then I just
pop it on all of my blemishes or bumps
on my skin and it really really evens
them out and then I'm just spraying some
Urban Decay all nighter spray and then
the foundation that I use normally for
brides is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
because it has SPF 10 it has no flash
bag it's really full coverage and it
just looks so amazing on every single
skin type so that is the foundation I
tend to go for and by the way I am
blending this in with a damp Beauty
Blender if you don't have one of these
bad boys seriously buy it I know it's
like thirty dollars but it's so worth it
so to conceal under the eyes I usually
use the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC
15 or MC 20 I have both so it just
depends on their skin type obviously I
wouldn't use them for people with the
darker skin type I do have other
concealers without but they're not Mac
and as you can see I'm just putting it
underneath my eyes to conceal and
highlight and then I like to blend it in
straightaway because I feel that
sometimes it's really hard to work with
if it's just left on blended on my face
so then I try to blend it in as quickly
as possible
and they consider I use to highlight the
center of my face is that hit me
Maybelline concealer in light fat I just
feel that this concealer much lighter
and easier to blend especially for my
center of my face because I don't really
feel like I need that thick mac
prolongwear concealer down there so
that's what I use and then I just still
blend it in with my damp Beauty Blender
and to set I like to use my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit and I like to
use the banana shade and I'm just using
this on an elf blush brush this brush is
actually so amazing for setting my under
eye concealer it's the right shape
density it's just amazing you need to
pick it up I think I got it from Target
and it was like eight dollars
and to set the rest of my face i'm using
my australia's fresh and flawless powder
I have these powders in every single
shade that have available because
obviously I need different colors for my
kid I just think this powder works for
everyone's skin and just looks amazing
on everyone so that's why I use it and
yeah so I'm just patting that all over
my face so if a bronzer of course I use
the benefit hoola and I use this on
every single client because it just
works so well on every single skin type
pale darker whatever
seriously if you don't have this in your
life you need it so badly so what I do
first is bronze up my cheeks with a
stippling brush and then I go in with a
more narrower contour brush this one is
by Pony cosmetics and it's actually
really good was the first time I tried
it so yeah check them out and I you've
probably seen me do this five million
times but once again I'm baking my face
with the coast of Australia translucent
powder on an angled sponge and as you
can see I'm just placing it in a direct
line straight underneath my contour down
the bridge of my nose and under my eyes
a little bit on my chin and on my
forehead
so as most of you already know I got my
eyebrows cosmetically tattooed so that
means I don't really need to do much to
them except for add brow gels so yeah
that's what I've done
so the eye shadows I typically use are
the makeup geek eyeshadows I just think
they're amazing quality and really
really pigmented so first up I'm using
this shade called creme brulee and I'm
using that as a transition shade I'm
just taking that on a really large
fluffy brush applies OH Eva and yeah
just putting that into my crease and
then I'm grabbing a little tiny bit of
cocoa bear which is a really dark brown
color and defining the crease a little
bit more so now I'm picking up the color
Ora in the Lime Crime Venus palette and
placing that on the inner corners of my
eye and dragging that probably a half
way onto my lid I think this color is so
amazing and brightening and it just
looks I just love it I love the whole
bright eyed look yeah so that's what I'm
doing so now I'm just grabbing the
blending brush from before and blending
all those colors together so there's no
harsh lines and then grabbing cocoa bear
on the same brush and placing that on
the outer corner of my eye
so one of the inner corner I shadow to
be a little bit more intense so what I
did was sprayed my brush with a bit of
fix+ by Mac and then dipped it in the
eyeshadow and then just went over it and
it definitely did make a massive
difference
so now I'm using my fav gel liner by
Melo cosmetics and I'm just using that
on a zoeva
eyeliner brush it's angled and it's
really really good it's also really good
for drawing when your eyebrows as well
but yet anyways I'm just doing a really
really small wing which is not what I'm
used to but I really like how it turned
out
so now I'm taking makeup geek eyeshadow
incorrupt and literally going over that
exact same line we just made with the
gel liner just to make it a bit more
smoky and not so full and intense
because it is Bridal and you want to
make it look as natural as possible if
that makes sense
even though this is definitely not
natural but you know what I'm saying and
then I'm just brushing off the excess
translucent powder that I use to bake
with and I just use a really really
large powder brush for that
so for my waterline I'm using the balm
cosmetics mr. right now
I line it in the color Brian so weird
but yep so I'm putting that on my
waterline it definitely makes the eyes
look a lot larger and brighter so yeah
that's what I'm using and then I'm just
going along the bottom of my lash line
with the Coco bear color again just on
that same tapered blending brush that we
use to smoke out the liner and yeah
so now I'm just adding that same lime
crime or eye shadow on my brow bone to
highlight it and then I'm curling my
lashes in preparation for mascara and
falsies and the mascara I'm using is the
new Maybelline lash sensational mascara
it's seriously my Holy Grail mascara at
the moment it's so amazing the Irish go
I use is by house of lashes best lash
glue ever and the eyelashes I'm using
are actually be one dollar ones that I
got some shot missed aid they are in the
style four to eight I believe
and here I'm just using a cotton bud to
take off the excess glue because I can't
be bothered waiting for it to disappear
and dry clear out because I'm impatient
and to finish off the rest of my face
I'm using the Milani baked blush in
Luminoso definitely my favorite blush of
all time and it definitely looks amazing
on every single person skintone
like I've said a billion times before
but yeah and for highlighter I've
recently been loving these becca
cosmetics or for impressed
skin Perfector holy this
highlighter is actually life like it's
incredible if you have the money to
spare on a decent highlighter that I
highly recommend this one
so to line my lips I'd use the eopns lip
liner in wish me rose these are planners
are so affordable they're like two
dollars or something some price line and
I love them and the lipstick I used is
Mac
angel and then on top of that I use the
full lips enhanced art 101 clumping or
lip gloss on top which is literally the
same color as met but in a gloss fall
it's amazing
and now I'm putting on my mum's tiara to
finish the look off and that is the
completed look thank you guys so much
