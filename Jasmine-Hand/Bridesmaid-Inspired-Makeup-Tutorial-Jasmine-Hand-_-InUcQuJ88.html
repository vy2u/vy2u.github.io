with the two-faced hangover primer and
just applying that all over her face
with a stippling brush then just
spraying her face a bit of mac's fix+
just to prep the skin I actually lost
the footage of me putting foundation on
not that I'm doing it now but it's time
to let you guys know so annoying but
first I did brows and I'm just taking
the Anasazi out Beverly Hills prowrap
allit and using the shade soft brown to
really lightly fill in her brows because
she has amazing natural brows and I
didn't want to overdo them so I'm just
filling them in and then going in with
some Maybelline fit me concealer to
define them a little bit more
by the way the lighting kind of changes
when I do the foundation and the
concealer just letting you guys know but
after I finished them the lighting goes
back to normal so I just wanted to
apologize for that so I'm just putting
on the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shades band putting
that all over a faith and then taking
the Tarte shape tech concealer in light
medium and you not true conceal her
under eye area then I go ahead to place
it on her forehead down the bridge of
our nose Cupid's bow and chin and of
course blending it all out as well
then taking at the alarm at the a
translucent powder and just using that
to bake her under eye area just to
ensure that that concealer doesn't
crease and then setting the rest of
their face with a nice pressed powder in
the shade beach I love this powder for
yellow like skin tones because she was
quite yellow so yeah I'm just placing
that all over with a large powder brush
than just setting her eyelids in place
in preparation for eyeshadow just to
ensure it goes on seamlessly so the
first eyeshadow I picked up was creme
brulee by makeup geek it's been very
loved and I'm just using a reborn crease
brush and just buffing that into her
crease
then taking cherry cola also by makeup
geek and preacher that's the name if
it's not I'll leave it listed down below
on my Mac to 1/7 and just mainly
focusing that on the outer corners of
the eyes I love this Mac two one seven
brush it basically does all the blending
for you so I would definitely recommend
this brush it's a bit pricey but
definitely worth it
so yeah I'm just really working at that
really deep purpley color in the outer
corners
then taking whimsical foiled eyeshadow
by makeup geek one of my favorites like
a pinky champagne e color and
displacement on the inner corners of the
eyes
then taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
waterproof cream color in jet which is
just black and just using that to line
her eyelids
then just coating her top and bottom
lashes with some mascara British I just
use the benefit roller lash I love it
and yeah I don't know what else and
sizes them then at full lashes I'm just
using my favorites from model rockets in
the style - one - I pretty much use them
on all of my clients and then I'm going
to smoke out the lower lash line with
the same colors we use on the top so
using creme brulee first and then going
in with cherry cola
I just really worked the cherry cola
color in the lower lash line and then
just using that brush to smoke it out
then I'm just taking the Too Faced
sweetheart bronzer and just using that
to bronze up her face and then I go
ahead and use hoola by benefit to
contour just using that on a spectrum
Cosmetics angled brush she didn't really
need much I didn't want to make it too
over-the-top just because her eyes were
so dramatic so I wanted to keep the
contour and all that to a minimum then
just taking some more of the Laura
Mercier translucent powder on the Beauty
Blender and just using that to define
underneath the contour then taking the
Too Faced sweetheart blush - peachy one
it's amazing and then taking the Urban
Decay I think was it illuminated it's so
glittery this is like one of the first
times I used it I did really liked it
but then I did go over the top with Mac
soft and gentle later because I felt
like it needed to be like placed down
because it just looked like glitter just
on the top of her cheekbones anyways for
a lip liner I use the Gerard cosmetics
share lip liner one of my favorite if
you watch my videos you know I literally
use these on like every one and then for
lipstick I used also a favorite which is
followed by Mac this look was actually
inspired
by my bridesmaids when I went to New
Zealand hates of you guys requested the
look so this is the look and the
lipstick that I used on them and then I
just decided to add a little bit of Miss
by Mac in the center just to create that
party sort of look and then I topped it
off with a clear gloss and that is the
final look done I hope you guys enjoyed
watching and if you did please don't
forget to give it a thumbs up for me and
subscribe to my channel for more videos
and I'll see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
