so first up I always like to use the
Garnier micellar water just on a cotton
pad just to go over the whole entire
face just to make sure it's a hundred
percent makeup free and clean and then
for primer I'm going in with the benefit
matte rescue primer and I'm just
basically putting that down her t-zone
area because that's where she tends to
get oily err the most and then I'm
grabbing the dried cosmetics lay all day
at setting spray and just spraying that
all over her face and then for
foundation I'm using the Mac Studio Fix
fluid I mixed n c37 and nw20 to get her
exact shade and I'm just using a damp
beauty blender to blend it all in
and then to conceal her under-eye area
of course I'm using the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shades light and I'm
just placing that underneath her eyes
bridge of a nose chin Cupid's bow and
then just true lines on either sides of
her mouth and then also just blending
that in with a damp Beauty Blender
and then to set her under our area of
course I'm using the laura mercier
translucent powder and i'm just baking
it using that same beauty blender and
then for brows of course and using I
keep saying of course because I just do
it all the time the Anastasia Beverly
Hills soft brown powder duo and just
filling them in with my favorite eyebrow
brush which is by pony cosmetics
and then I'm just brushing off the
excess powder from the bake and then I'm
grabbing the Maybelline fit me concealer
again in the light and I'm just using
that to carve her brows
and then also using that same concealer
I'm using that to prime her eyelids and
then I set it with the laura mercier
translucent powder
and then for highlighter I'm using my
favorite at the moment which is the Mac
soft and gentle and just applying that
to the highest points of her cheekbones
down the bridge of her nose Cupid's bow
and pretty much everywhere as you can
see and then two bronze I'm using the
hoola benefit bronzer just on a angled
brush by spectrum cosmetics and just
placing that in the hollows of her
cheekbones and then I'm just lightly
contouring her nose and then I go ahead
to grab the balm betty loumanizer
this is seriously changed my bronzing
game I absolutely love this product and
I've recently just started using it on
all my clients so yeah so for eyes I
used creme brulee in the crease as a
transition shade I'm just using
windscreen wiper motions just on a big
fluffy brush and then I'm grabbing cocoa
bear or these are by makeup geek by the
way I'll leave everything listed down
below I'm just taking that on a another
blending brush and just putting that in
the crease as well as well as it's a
little bit above her crease and then I'm
grabbing Urban Decay's half naked baked
shadow this is my favorite gold
eyeshadow at the moment and I'm just
using that on a flat shader brush I
actually sprayed a bit of my brush with
a bit of fix pass first just to
intensify the pigment and I'm just
placing that all over her mobile lid
and then I'm taking mock up by makeup
geek just on my map-21 7 brush and as
you can see I'm just concentrating that
mostly in her crease and up and I'm just
blending blending blending adding more
product and blending
so then taking Coco bear by makeup geek
and using that to blend into her lower
lashline and then using that on the
other side and then I kind of mix in
creme brulee as well just to make the
transition seamless and then I go in
with maca just to deepen it up a bit
because I really wanted her eyes to pop
and it definitely did
then I'm taking the Rimmel exaggerate
nude liner and placing that in her
waterline and then for mascara I'm using
the penny cosmetics white night mascara
and just placing that on her top and
bottom lashes
you
then the lips I'm taking the top
cosmetics TBT lipliner and obviously
lining her lips and then I wanted to
create an ombre lip so I went in with
Mac well on the outer sections of her
lips and then in the center I use myth
by Mac also
then just over the top I think I used my
Rimmel clear gloss I'll leave it loose
down below anyways but I couldn't find
it on the Google Images to show you but
I'll live list down below so this is
what the look looks like without
eyelashes I think this looks bomb
without eyelashes it's definitely so
daytime appropriate and just looks
amazing but I did do a little eyelash
segment at the end if you guys wanted to
see what it looked like with eyelashes
because the picture that I posted on
Instagram she was wearing eyelashes so
yeah I thought I would show you guys
what it looked like without lashes oh I
just I'm obsessed with this look so much
it's so everyday I'm I'm living I'm
living for it and I'm living for Lily's
face obviously um and so for lashes I
use the model rock style 3 and the glue
I used was the jaw lash glue
so this is the final look with the
lashes I hope you guys enjoyed watching

you did comment below what you'd like to
see next and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
