today I decided to do a really really
dark brown smokey eye with a matte brown
lip and I used the Lime Crime Salem
Velveteen that I'm obsessed with at the
moment I just woke up today and I was
like I need to do a tutorial with lime
from Salem so I did and I really really
like how this turned out
so if you would like to know how I
created it then keep watching oh and by
the way I didn't film my foundation just
because I already have a video on how I
do my foundation so I'll link it down
below so yeah I'll get straight into the
tutorial on this book okay so for eyes I
think I'm going to be using my chocolate
bar and my live chrome dienes palette I
think I want to do a blown-out dark
brown smokey eye because I really really
want to use this blank on Salem lipstick
so first I'm just gonna take a large
fluffy brush this is by Jessup I'm just
gonna take this peanut kind of color and
use that as a transition shade
so now I'm just gonna grab a flat brush
this is the urban decay one that came
from my palette and I'm just gonna take
the dark brown color and pack that all
over my lid trying not to go above my
crease because otherwise I'll look like
I've been bashed okay and then I'm just
gonna grab that large fluffy brush again
and so I'm just gonna pack on more just
going to take a little bit of this
lighter brown color it's just this one
here and pop that in between the
transition shade and the dark brown just
so the lines not as harsh what I'm gonna
do is clean up the edges with some
concealer I haven't really done this in
a very long time I'm just gonna sharpen
up the edges so I'm just going to use my
Melo gel and use that to line at my
I'm just gonna grab a tapered blending
brush and just taking that dark brown
eyeshadow then I'm gonna grab it
blending brush this is by a bush and
blend it down so I'm just gonna line
like tightline I'm going to use this mr.
right now and Dean civil actions I'm
going to use my socialized minx 2.0 I'm
just so excited to use these so first
I'm just gonna curl my lashes I'm just
going to apply a coat of mascara just
going to use this pony cosmetics
this is what they look like they are so
amazing and I think I'm just gonna use
the house of lashes lash glue that's my
favorite so I'm just going to like 30
seconds for the glue to become tacky so
I'm just okay now for lips I'm going to
use my Lancome assailant and tool I'm
going to use this berry and lip liner in
the color I think it's called chocolate
so this is the completed look thank you
