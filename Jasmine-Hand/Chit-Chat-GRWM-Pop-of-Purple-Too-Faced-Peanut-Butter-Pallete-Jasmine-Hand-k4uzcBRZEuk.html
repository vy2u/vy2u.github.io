so today's video is just going to be a
chitchat e-type makeup tutorial I have
heaps of new products that I've been so
so keen to try so I thought why not just
give you guys the first impression that
/ tutorial in one that even makes any
sense anyways I'm going to get straight
onto it for primer I'm going to use the
Nivea men sensitive post shape I've been
using this stuff for maybe five months
now and I love it it's like one of my
favorite primers to use I just feel like
this primer is amazing for my skin type
which is oily I do use my other primers
but I just feel like this is pretty good
for the price okay so I'm gonna start
off by spraying my face with the new
Gerard cosmetics play all dates setting
spray and this one is in the scent of
jasmine well I haven't actually tried
these so I'm gonna give it a go it says
that you can spray before or after
makeup I never really usually spray
setting spray before makeup I'm just
gonna do it anyway
that's got a really strong scent but
really nice it's actually really nice
now as the foundation today I'm going to
step a little bit out of my comfort zone
and not use a foundation that I normally
use day-to-day I'm going to use the new
will not really new any more Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless in the shade
220 I hope this isn't too dark I am tan
I'm not like super ultra tan so I'm
gonna see what this looks like
yep I think that's gonna match me I've
tried this foundation before and from
what I remember I wasn't really a fan I
don't know why that I can't remember
literally tried this like months ago so
I'm gonna give it another go
I hate foundations that don't come with
a pump just really pisses me off so far
it's actually not too bad
coverage is quite nice as well
 it's hot in here okay second first
impressions of this foundation I quite
like it to be honest I don't know why I
didn't like it the first time I honestly
can't remember but yeah that's the
foundation on the concealer I'm going to
use the Maybelline fit me
surprise surprise but I just love this
concealer I actually picked up eight
shades yesterday Utley on Priceline in
coal sales because they were only seven
dollars each and obviously why wouldn't
I smoked up cause death babe just
putting that on me forehead that was
hurtful see I swear I don't talk like
that and then I'm just gonna pry my
eyelids with it
oh it's gay use of you will ask me oh my
god why do you use concealer on your
eyelids that it just makes the eye
shadow crease well if you put concealer
on it and you set it straight away it
won't crease so now I'm gonna bake with
my Laura Mercier translucent powder this
is seriously just the best baking powder
I've ever used in my life holy I
used to use the UM face of Australia one
but this one literally it makes the
under eye area feel like silk it's
amazing it is a bit pricey I know it's
about sixty dollars from David Jones but
honestly worth it and it lasts ages so
if you're looking to invest in a good
quality translucent powder then I would
recommend this one so to set the rest of
my face of course I'm using the
Australia's fresh and flawless in the
shade darkest Brown I've actually had
heaps of people asking me where they can
buy it if they're not in Australia and I
recommend in eBay like I'm sure eBay
would sell them otherwise shop and box
so shopping box is also available for
people like from America that want to
get Australian
so you can definitely check out shopping
box if you want to try it out I highly
recommend it if you've been watching me
for ages you probably just like oh shut
the up we know but seriously best
pal ever
and then I'm just going to take off that
excess bag okay I'm gonna do my brows
and I'm going to use the dip brow pony
pony dip brow pomade by Anastasio
Beverly Hills in soft brown I only just
started using these dip brows recently
because I don't know why I just picked
it up one day and I was like I
actually like this product I don't know
why I stopped using it anyways apart
from the fact that my eyebrows need some
serious shaping and doing I'm gonna go
ahead and fill them in so I haven't got
my eyebrows properly like threaded in
about let's say six months because I'm
lazy and I always just pluck them when I
feel like they need to be maintained and
then I feel like it's a waste of money
going and getting them threaded when
they don't really need to be threaded
but they seriously honestly do now so if
you're probably thinking wait doesn't
she have eyebrows others yes I have a
great house but I seriously couldn't not
fill them in when I'm doing a full face
of makeup just because like powder gets
in them and they kind of lose their
shape after you've done your base I just
like to go over not too much but just
kind of define the shape a little bit
more
holy-shit actually is really bad so now
I'm just gonna carve the photo so it
looks like I just got those done but I
really did in this honestly the trick to
like puff brows by the way eyebrow just
doesn't look good
Oh Oh God okay I'm just gonna accept the
fact that my eyebrows just will never be
fleek right now so now I'm just using
the designer brands eyebrow gel which is
pretty good by the way
okay I know you guys are gonna kill me
but I am going to use hoola to bronze
and contour because to be honest I don't
want to step up my makeup by using
something that I don't like I'm sure you
guys feel the same way about the
products like you just couldn't do a
face about it I can do my bed without
this so yes
I'm just using that on a mac 135 brush
which is my favorite bronzing brush ever
it's about $80 but freaking worth it
you go under my jaw to create one
because I don't really have one
it's going to bronze up a bit of my nose
as well today I'm going to bake that
contour and I'm going to use the effects
of Australia translucent powder the only
reason why I don't use a lot of Mercier
one underneath my contour is because
like it's just going underneath there
it's not like it's going underneath my
eyes so I don't like to waste it so I
use this one for underneath my contours
I think it works well as well so so I'm
just doing that being a drag queen and
then I'm going to contour my nose and
I'm going to use this brush so now I'm
going to brush off the baked
and kind of like blend everything
together
well it looks like I'm going for a harsh
contoured look okay so if that happens
so sometimes I do go a bit over the top
on my bronzer but when that happens all
I do is I just grab some pressed powder
and just the bronzing brush and all I do
is I just go over the areas where I feel
like it's a bit harsh so I'm just gonna
go so the blush I'm going to use the
Sigma heavenly powder blush which is
like a gorgeous Coralie color and I'm
going to pop that on my cheeks
and then to highlight I'm going to use
the new laura geller well it's not
really new but it's new to me because I
only just got it recently gilded honey
highlight up which is drugstore in the
u.s. literally why don't we get these in
our local price I honestly look how
amazing is highlighter is though like
 me dude
like look at that
so but I said I'm going to use the new
two-faced peanut butter palette which
looks like this holy it looks
 amazing I was so excited to try
it I'm definitely gonna use the purple
in my lower lash line for home of color
because pixie we always asked me to do
like looks with color and color is a
little bit out of my comfort zone I
wouldn't wear it on a day-to-day basis
or going out or anything like that like
I would only wear it at home and I know
that needs to change because I am a
makeup artist and I should be
experimenting and being comfortable
wearing color but I'm not quite
comfortable wearing color but purple is
an exception I would wear purple out
because I love purple on my lower lash
line because I think that it makes brown
eyes pop I'm first gonna go in with
peanut butter which is right here and
I'm going to use that in my crease I'm
just using that in and above my crease
thinking I want to use the Goldy color
which is right there and I'm going to
pack it on my lid and I'm just going to
use my fingers well that is so pretty
PS don't mind my disgusting fingers I
ripped all my nails off because one of
them fell off and when one of them falls
off they're all coming off does anyone
else like that and they were like
seriously so overgrown so there's no
point in just getting that one like nail
fixed so I was like it and I ripped
them all off
it's actually so satisfying though
seriously okay this is like really
pretty and now I'm going to go in with
nuts about you which is like a bit
orangie terracotta color and I'm gonna
use that in my crease as well it's going
to add a bit more of that gold on the
lid I'm going to leave the top lashline
for the moment and I'm gonna work on the
bottom so I actually received the new
full spectrum eyeliner pencils by a
makeup geek and I'm going to line my
waterline with this gorgeous purple
color which is called Orchard looks like
that put this in my waterline oh I get
so ticklish when I put stuff in my
waterline especially pencils
oh my eyes are dying but now I'm going
to grab the pant butter palette again
and I'm gonna take jelly which is the
purple and use that to smoke the bottom
lash line out so now I'm just going to
highlight the inner corners of my eyes
I'm just going to use the gold okay so
I'm thinking I'm gonna go one step
further and use the NYX glam liner in
color it's in now I'll leave it down
below maybe it's called aqua luxe but
it's just a liquid like glitter liner
and I'm going to use that and I'm going
to put that on my lid so I'm definitely
going all out oh wow this is actually
really pretty it's more of like a
yellowy based gold but still really
really nice
so now I'm going to create a wing and
I'm going to use the taught clay paint
lineup I'm just going to squeeze it on
the back of my hand so now I'm going to
go in with mascara and I'm just going to
use my essence one circle lashes I'm
going to use the billion lashes which
were kindly sent to me and they look
amazing
these are in the style and Nikki so I'm
just using some passive lashes lash glue
this is the mini tribal version it's so
cute look how small it is
the phones when I put like a dramatic
latch on it kind of just like hides all
of my eyeshadow look so it's really hard
to find like really nice like thick
wispy lashes that don't hide the
eyeshadow because like for example
passive lashes iconic they're so thick
and like intense you can't even see
eyeshadow when you wear them well when I
wear them know about you so I'm thinking
I might put Ashton on just because it'll
match my eye makeup amazingly it's kind
of like a vert brownie nude I'll swatch
it on my hand but I really think that
it'll complement the eyes hey no white
hair okay so to line my lips I found the
perfect lip liner and it's the taut
later Graham which looks like this so
I'm gonna go ahead and lie
now I'm going to go in with Ashton this
looks really really similar to dull
cheek a actually not really now that
it's on then I'm just going to spray my
face with some more of the sale day by
drug cosmetics I hope you guys enjoyed
