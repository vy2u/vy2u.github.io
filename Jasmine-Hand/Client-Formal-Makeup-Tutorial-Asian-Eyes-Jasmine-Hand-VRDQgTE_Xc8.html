photo ready primer water I'm pretty sure
it's called and using it as a primer on
her face and then going in with my Mac
Studio Fix foundation in NC 40 and
buffing that all in with a damp Beauty
Blender also when using a Beauty Blender
make sure to use dabbing motions instead
of like swiping motions on the face
because it'll just make the face look
more flawless if it's dabbed in and
pressed into the skin and then using my
favorite concealer which is the
Maybelline fit me in light and I'm just
using a Jessup concealer brush just to
apply it under her eyes and then I'll go
ahead and blend that in and then apply
on her forehead down the bridge of her
nose Cupid's bow and on her chin and
then blending it out and then I'm just
using a smaller kabuki style brush and
just blending in the hard-to-reach
places such as around the nose and the
tear duct area because obviously you
can't reach them with a Beauty Blender
and then I'm going in with my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and priming her eyelids
I never use his stuff because I always
just use concealer as a primer on the
eyelids but I remember to you this time
so I used it
so now I'm baking the under eye
concealer area with the laura mercier
translucent powder basically I love
baking and because it makes the
concealer creaseless all day long and it
just looks absolutely flawless so that's
why I love baking and then while that's
baking I'm just using my Australis fresh
and flawless face powder in a darkest
Brown and setting the rest of her face
so for eyebrows I'm using my own
associate beverly hills probe at the pro
brow palette and i'm using the color
chocolate to fill in her brows I use
both shades so I use a darker shade for
the ends and tail of the brows and the
lighter shade in the little duo for the
start of her brow
and then just using the light concealer
again I'm just carving her brows with a
concealer brush and now I'm just
brushing off that excess powder from the
under-eye bake and then I'm going into
bronzing her cheekbones I'm using the
benefit hoola bronzer of course as per
usual I'm just using a sigma angled
contour brush and yeah just warming up
for cheeks first and then I'll go ahead
and make her cheekbones a little bit
more chiseled using the zoeva luxe face
paint brush and then using the same
Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm
using a angled sponge which you can just
get from any drugstore Priceline
cosmetics plus if you live in Australia
and they're literally worth nothing I'm
a baking her face so I'm just creating a
line from underneath her contour so from
the top of her ear to the side of her
mouth we're going in with these Sigma
heavenly powder blush and placing that
on her cheeks with my zoeva blush brush
and then I'm just brushing off that
excess baked and then I am highlighting
with the Anastasia Beverly Hills so
Hollywood highlighter and just placing
that on the highest points of her
cheekbones under her brow bone on my
Cupid's bow to be fair nose and the
bridge of her nose
so for the eyes I'm taking my makeup
geek creme brulée single eyeshadow and
using that as a transition color and
sleeping that over the majority of the
lid and in her crease and I'm taking
makeup geeks whimsical fold eyeshadow
and at first I thought what I wanted to
do was just put it on the lid and then
make it smoky Brown II along the crease
area but then I changed my mind and
decided that I wanted that eyeshadow
just in the inner corner area and then
the Browns on the outer corner area so
now taking cocoa bear by makeup geek
also and just running that through the
crease and upper crease and then I'm
also putting it on the outer corner as
well and then I'm going to go in with
Anasazi Beverly Hills fudge single
eyeshadow and darken up the outer corner
and just a little bit of the crease as
well
and then to highlight the brow bone I'm
taking makeup geek shimma shimma and
placing that underneath the brow bone
super Wings loner I like to use the
Maybelline eye studio in black so I line
the whole lid first and then I get the
client to open their eyes map out the
wing then I get them to close and then I
connect everything together it is
seriously the best way to do winged
liner ever only discovered it about six
months ago and it literally makes it so
much easier
but yeah practice does make perfect
winged line on other people is so hard
so if you're struggling just keep on
practicing and I'm sure you'll get there
and then I'm just taking my displays
with mascara wanna actually use benefit
roller lash and I'm just quoting her top
and bottom lashes
in preparation for false lashes just a
trick if you get eyeliner on the lid
make sure you wait for it to dry and
then just scrape it off with a q-tip it
comes off so easy just thought I'd let
you guys know so now I'm lining her
waterline also with the Maybelline eye
studio in black and I'm just using that
same winged liner brush I love using gel
liner in the woodland so I think it
lasts all day and night and yeah it's
just like the most pigmented way of
putting black in your waterline in my
opinion and then I am taking maca by
makeup geek and smoking out for lower
lash lines so it doesn't look like just
a black line and then I'm putting some
mascara on her bottom lashes so the
lashes I'm using the red cherry lashes
in the style 7 4 7 m and I've used the
House of lashes lash glue which is my
fave lash glue ever for lips I'm going
in with Mac boldly bare lip liner and
over the top I'm using Mac's faux
lipstick and then just went over the top
with a clear gloss you can use any I
actually can't remember which one I use
slowly to the final look I hope you guys
enjoyed it I did try and play around
with a red lip so I use rooby-roo lip
liner by Mac with Russian red lipstick
over the top don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
I will see you next time
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
