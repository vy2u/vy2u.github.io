so if a primer I'm using the new Marc
Jacobs coconut primer and I found that
it works really well with clients with
drier skin I usually tend to use this
one for dry skin and the hourglass veil
or the new benefit the matte mattifying
gel for more oily skin see I'm just
applying that all over a face with a
stippling brush so the foundation I'm
using the Mac Studio Fix fluid as per
always and I'm using that in the shade
and c-37 it's the perfect shade for when
you're tanned or faked and I use this
all the time when I use my loving tan
ultra dark mousse so that's a little tip
for you so yeah I'm just using my damp
Beauty Blender to buff it into her skin
so the concealer under the eyes I'm
using my fav concealer in the whole
world which is the Maybelline fit me in
the shade light and I'm just placing
that underneath her eyes a little bit on
her forehead down the bridge of her nose
Cupid's bow on her chin and then I'm
using it as an eye primer on her eyelids
and I'm just using a concealer brush
from Jessup I'll leave everything that I
use down below so it's easy for you guys
to find and then I'm just blending that
all in with the same damp Beauty Blender
so now I'm just taking a synthetic
kabuki style brush well a mini-version
and I'm just blending out the concealer
in the hard-to-reach places like the
eyelids inner corners and just around
the nose and this one is from eBay as
well and it suggests a brush as well I
know I love Jessop brushes are
absolutely amazing okay and now to set
the concealer underneath the eyes I'm
taking the under Stiles ear Beverly
Hills contour kit and I'm taking the
banana and the other matte shade and
just pressing that true it sets the
concealer so set the rest of her face
I'm using my favorite setting powder
which is the Australia's fresh and
flawless and this is in the color
darkest brown and I'm just using a
massive powder brush and patting that
onto her skin make sure when you do is
setting powder you don't wipe because
then I'll just take the foundation off
and then for brows actually lost half
the footage but I'm using the pro brow
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
I used dark brown so to bronze and
contour I'm using the hoola by benefit
bronzer of course and I'm using that on
my Mac one to four brush I'm pretty sure
if it's not I'll leave it down below
Rachelle has amazing cheekbones so I'm
just putting that in the hollows of her
cheeks around her forehead temples and
on her jaw line and then I decided to
bake using the laura mercier translucent
powder so I'm just basically packing
that underneath her eyes with an angled
sponge and then also defining her
contour
so after a few minutes I am brushing off
the excess powder with a large stippling
brush for blush I'm using the Milani
baked blush in Luminoso this one is
definitely my favorite coral blush in my
whole collection I absolutely love the
way it looks on everyone and then for
holiday I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills so Hollywood this is hands-down my
favorite highlighter of all time it
looks absolutely amazing on every skin
tone so yeah I'm using that and the
highlight was definitely on fleek today
so for eyes I'm using the morphe 35o
palette I've put little hearts and the
colors that I'll be using so I'm
starting off the first color in the
crease as a transition shade and then
taking this dark brown color I'm using
that on the same blending brush and I'm
just placing that on the outer and inner
portion of the eye I kind of like
playing around and then I just had to do
like a subtle sort of halo eye I don't
know you'll see what I mean
so here I'm just using the Mac to 1-7
brows just because it's a bit more
narrow and easy to get into the inner
corner area and then I'm just grabbing a
massive blending brush and blending the
edges out
tonight is taking the first transition
color we use and I'm just using that to
blend everything together and then I
went in with the copper color which is
so gorgeous I didn't really like the
pigmentation when I use the brush that I
decided to use my finger and the
pigmentation was so much better so yeah
and then I am blending everything
together so now I'm using the Maybelline
eye studio gel liner in black and I'm
using that true line her waterline so to
smoke out her lower lash line I'm using
the same a dark brown color and I'm
using this on a zoeva like packing
eyeshadow brush and I find that this
works really well to smoke the lower
lash line because it gets right up in
there and then I'm taking that first
transition color that we use in the
crease and using that as a transition on
the lower lash line if that makes any
sense and then I'm using the new Tarte
clay paint liner and just doing a simple
line across her eyes so for mascara I
use the benefit they're real on a
disposable mascara one that I got from
ebay I'll leave the link down below
where I got them from and then for
lashes I'm using the model rock 2-1 to
lashes which are my faves and the joy
lash glue so I place the glue on the
lashes wait 30 seconds for glue to
become tacky and then place them on the
lid it just makes it easier for the
lashes to stick on because it's already
kind of half dry if you get what I mean
so then just using the same mascara wand
I'm coating her lower lashes and then
also the top lashes just to blend the
false lashes in with her real lashes and
then for lips I use the Mac saw lip
liner with the faux lipstick also by Mac
so this is the final look I hope you
guys enjoyed watching and learnt
something new rachelle also has a
youtube channel which i will link down
below thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
