so today's client tutorial is going to
be of the lovely Juanita so heaps of you
were requesting a client tutorial with a
woman with color so I hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial and I'm just going
to get straight ahead and get started so
for primer I'm using the benefit
Porefessional I'm just using that on a
stippling brush because I really wanted
a smooth and flawless base she had quite
a bit of open pause so this primer is
absolutely amazing for that and then I'm
just spraying her face with the Gerard
cosmetics lay all day setting spray in
the scent jasmine and I've been obsessed
with this stuff ever since I started
using it I'll have a discount code down
below if you're interested in buying it
and then for foundation I'm pretty sure
I used n C 45 mixed with and W 45 if I'm
wrong I'll leave it down below for sure
in the description box but yeah all I'm
doing is just applying that to a face
and blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender
and then to correct the darkness on her
lid and just below her eyes I'm using
the LA girl Pro concealer in the orange
color and as you can see I'm just
applying that to her under eye area and
on her lid and then I'm just blending it
out with a damp Beauty Blender
and then using my favorite concealer I'm
using the Maybelline fit me in the shade
30 and I'm just using that to conceal
her under eye area and then I decided to
go and highlight her face because it's
like the perfect shade for her skin tone
for highlighting as well so I went down
the bridge of her nose a bit on our
forehead Cupid's bow and on her chin and
then of course just blending everything
all together with a damp Beauty Blender
and then I'm just adding a little bit on
her eyelids and blending it out with
like a small kabuki style brush just to
prime her lids so this is actually a
little trick that I learned myself when
I very first did a woman with color so
I've just placing that conceal that I
used to highlight straight underneath
where I would usually contour and then
I'm blending it out and then you'll see
later when I go to contour a face it's
so much easier to map out the area and
to make it look really nicely contoured
but anyways right now I'm just making
sure everything's blend out seamlessly
so I'm just using like the little kabuki
brush to blend out all the creases
underneath her eyes so everything is
perf
and then I'm baking her concealer with
the laura mercier transit powder her
friend was actually here will our friend
and it was like what the hell are you
doing he was so baffled as to why I was
doing this but then when I wiped it off
it was like oh okay so this is why she
has a little bit of a chuckle anyway so
like after 30 seconds I'm just brushing
off the excess and then it just leaves
the under eye area nice and highlighted
and then I'm taking the Anasazi Beverly
Hills medium to tan contouring kit and
I'm taking the bottom row in the middle
that color and I'll leave the color
listed down below cuz I don't know what
are these ones from my head but I'm just
going in with the benefit contouring
brush that came with the whole lot and
I'm just contouring her cheeks
and then for blush I use the Benefit
Cosmetics plum blush and I just applied
that to the apples of her cheeks and
then I'm just setting the eyelids with
one of the matte shades from the kit I'm
pretty sure it was the one on the right
at the top and then I'm filling in her
brows with the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
Pro brow palette and I used the shade
granite which is the bottom row in the
middle and then just using the same
concealer as before the shade number 30
and I'm just using that on a concealer
brush to make her brows a little bit
more defined and then I'm going in with
the Anasazi Beverly Hills clear brow gel
and setting her brows
then going in with the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills glow kit I'm taking
dipping in gold I think
yep dipping in gold and I'm just using
that on the Anasazi Beverly Hills
highlighting brush I feel like this
whole tutorial is going to be Anasazi
Beverly Hills but I just absolutely love
her stuff and I'm just highlighting her
face as you can see then it for her
transition shade I'm using the makeup
geek cosmetics creme brulee and I'm just
running that through her crease and then
I'm using a BH hot chocolate and I'm
just using that to define her out of
ease and I'm just totally building this
up to get like a blended sort of color
like I didn't want to go straight in
with like a really dark color so I'm
just slowly gradually building the color
up to a nice dark brown I literally
sometimes don't even understand myself
when I'm talking
then taking makeup geeks shimma shimma
and I'm just using that on a I shadow
packing brush I sprayed my brush with a
little bit of fix+ so I can get the most
out of the pigment and I'm just placing
that on the inner corner of her eyes
and then just taking the same blending
brush as we used earlier I'm just using
that to blend everything seamlessly
together
so now just going in with hot chocolate
again and I'm just placing that on the
outer V's to make it a little bit more
darker and smokey the Falana I like to
Zee Maybelline eye studio gel liner in
black and I'm just using that on a sigma
winged liner brush and what I like to do
first is go over the lash line before I
do the wing I'm going to set up like a
little how to winged line the neck so
I've everything up so I hope I explained
everything as easy as possible okay so
for winged liner I get the client to
look straight ahead
I map out the wing then I get the
clients to close and then I connect
everything together
I find that it's so much easier to do
winged liner on other people when their
eyes are open I get them to open quite a
few times throughout just so I can see
exactly what it's going to look like as
opposed to doing the wing when the eyes
are shut the whole time because then it
may look good when the eyes are sharp
but then when you open it it could look
really really bad like you know how
sometimes eyeliner can Bend when you
open it if you don't do it right well
this is just like a way that I found
works for me every single time so I hope
that helped you guys and then for
mascara I'm using the printed cosmetics
white night mascara on a disposable
mascara wand heaps of you guys always
ask me where I get them from I just got
them from eBay just type in disposable
mascara wands and you should be able to
find them they're super cheap and
they're amazing
so for lashes I just used the ardell
demi wispies because I didn't find that
the model rock ones that I had fitted
her eye shape or looked as natural as
these ones did she didn't really want
anything dramatic because she never
really wears makeup anyways so I thought
that these lashes would be absolutely
perfect for the look and then to smoke
out her lower lash line I'm just using
the hot chocolate shade by a BH and I'm
just using that on a tapered eyeshadow
brush and I'm just using that too
and her waterline out I didn't put any
black or anything in there I kept it
blank just to keep the look a little bit
more simple and then for lips I went
with brave by Mac and then I just put a
clear Mac lip gloss over the top and
that is the completed look I hope you
