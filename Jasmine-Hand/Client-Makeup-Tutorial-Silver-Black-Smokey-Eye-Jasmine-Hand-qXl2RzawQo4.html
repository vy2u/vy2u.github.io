so in today's video I'm doing another
client tutorial and I decided to do this
beautiful silver black smokey eye on the
amazing Brooklyn so if you'd like to see
how I created this look then keep on
watching so to prime I'm using the new
benefit professional matte rescue primer
and this consistency is more of a gel in
comparison to the original benefit
Porefessional like thicker consistency
and I'm just applying that with a
stippling brush all over her face so now
I'm spraying her face with fix+ before
foundation and the foundation I'm using
is the Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC 35 and
then buffing that in with a damp Beauty
Blender so I only tend to use around two
to two-and-a-half pumps on the average
client unless they want a full coverage
or their skin needs it usually people
with more like acne prone skin or have
blemishes I tend to use two and a half
to three permits but because Brooklyn
has amazing skin I only used two pumps
so yeah and then I'm just buffing that
in with my damp Beauty Blender
so if the concealer today I decided to
use something a bit different so I use
the NARS radiant creamy concealer in
custard and this concealer is probably
my favorite high-end concealer just
because I love the colors I love the way
it blends and looks underneath the eyes
so yeah I'm just putting that underneath
her eyes and buffing that out with my
damp Beauty Blender and then I go on to
putting it on her forehead down the
bridge of her nose on her Cupid's bow
and on her chin and then also blending
it out
and then I'm just taking a mini kabuki
style brush and just using that to blend
the concealer in the hard-to-reach
places like straight underneath the eye
and in the tear duct area and then to
bake the concealer I'm using my fav
which is the Laura Mercier translucent
powder just on the same damp Beauty
Blender and then to set the rest of our
face I'm using the Australis fresh and
flawless face powder in darkest Brown
and then I'm going in with Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot to prime her eyelids and
then after about a minute or so I'm
going in with a large powder brush and
brushing off the excess powder from the
baked soda bronzing contour I'm using my
whole up by benefit bronzer and I'm
using that with a brush that it came
with it's absolutely amazing and
definitely worth the price so I'm just
going in and popping that in the hollows
of her cheekbones and then later on I'm
going to go in with the mac 135 brush to
bronze up her face a bit more to blend
everything all seamlessly together put
it around her temples forehead
underneath her jaw and then finally
underneath her lip
and I'm just lightly contouring her nose
just using a large kind of fluffy sort
of brush I'll leave the link down below
where I got it from but she doesn't
really need much of a nose contour
because her nose is already like narrow
so I just decided to keep it light and
then to bake her contour i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder again
just on an angled sponge and yeah just
placing that straight underneath her
contour and then again after a minute or
so I'm just using a stippling style
brush to brush off the excess baked so
the blush I use the balm cosmetics hot
mama blush and I'm just placing that on
the apples of her cheeks and bringing it
out to the sides of her face if that
makes any sense at all and then for
highlight I am using the Laura Mercier
indiscretion and I literally always
forget that I have this so I need to
whip this out more often because it is
beautiful pass I'm so sorry if my head
makes an appearance and the majority of
this tutorial I'm trying to figure out a
way and an angle in which you can't
really see my head in it so yeah I'm
working on it
before eyes I'm using the Anasazi
Beverly Hills shadow couture palette and
I'm firstly starting off with soft peach
and I'm just running that in her crease
as a transition shade and then govern
the shade Morocco and I'm also using
that as a transition shade I'm just
using that in her crease with a large
blending brush through now I'm taking
Sheik and I actually wet the brush with
a little bit of fixed pass just to
intensify the shadow a bit more and I'm
just placing that on the inner corners
of her eyes now I'm taking fudge on the
same blending brush as we used in the
crease and I'm just working that on the
outer corners of her eyes also just a
tip when you're applying dark shadows
make sure you don't go above the crease
because that's when it's going to look
like you got punched in the face so just
make sure you keep the shadow underneath
the crease and yet and then I'm taking
the matte black eye shadow which is
called neo or nor how do you plan that
no no okay no I'm just going over the
fudge eyeshadow just to darken it up a
bit and then I'm just going in with soft
peach / fudge / a bit of everything and
just blending it all together line her
waterline I'm using the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner pot and I'm just using
that with a taut eyeliner brush and then
to smoke out the lower lash line I'm
using fudge and I'm just using that with
a eyeshadow packing brush from zoeva
I'll leave it listed down below make
sure when you smoke out the lower lash
line you go as close to the waterline as
possible because that's what's going to
make the black in the waterline like
smudge more and make it look smokier and
then I'm grabbing noir and just using
that on a more tapered sort of blending
brush and just going and darkening the
outer corner
so for mascara I use the benefit roller
lash and obviously I use disposable
mascara wand if you don't and if you're
a makeup artist and I highly recommend
that you buy them they're really really
cheap off eBay I'll leave a link down
below because if you don't and your
client before that has had
conjunctivitis or whatever and then you
use that on your next client then they
will probably also get conjunctivitis
which is disgusting so the lashes I use
the model rock lashes in the color not
the color the style - one - and the glue
that I used was the House of lashes lash
glue of course which is my fave and then
to line her lips I'm using Mac stone lip
liner and the lipstick I used was the
Gerard cosmetics underground
and then finally I'm just adding some
mascara to our bottom lashes and also
her top lashes to blend her falsies with
her real lashes so there you have it I
hope you guys enjoyed watching and if
you did don't forget to give it a thumbs
up for me and yeah I guess I'll see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
