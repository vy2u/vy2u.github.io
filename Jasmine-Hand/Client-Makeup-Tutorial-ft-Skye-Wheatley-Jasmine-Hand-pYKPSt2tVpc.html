I only have that much time to give you
an intro but I'm just going to get
straight into it so for primer I use the
hourglass feel primer or veil I think
it's pronounced I don't know but I use
that for primer because it makes the
foundation last all day and it just
looks amazing on the skin it is quite
pricey I'm pretty sure it's about $70
per bottle but it definitely is worth it
okay so firstly I want to talk about
this metal plate you can get it from
ebay for about ten dollars and basically
it's just an alternative to squirting
product on the back of your hand it's
just a little bit more hygienic and
professional so for foundations I use
the Mac Studio Fix fluid the while I'm
using is in NC 37 which is one of the
most popular shades along with NC 35 and
I like to and put that on with a damp
Beauty Blender I don't really like to
use kabuki buddy I just feel that me
blenders and make it look even more
flawless so as you can see I'm just
working my way around her face and
dabbing it on
okay so if I under a concealer I'm using
my favorite Maybelline fit me concealer
in the lighter shade as you guys already
know it's my absolute favorite concealer
ever and it's only $15 I would HIGHLY
highly recommend this if you haven't
tried it I haven't in every shade
obviously for obvious reasons for
different clients with different skin
tones so as you can see I'm putting it
underneath her eyes using it as an eye
primer on her forehead down bridge of
her nose on her chin and a little bit on
her Cupid's bow and just blending that
out again with my damp you do blender
and then to blend the concealer on the
eyelids and the hard-to-reach areas just
around the tear duct I'm using a small
sort of kabuki style brush you can get
these ones off eBay I'm pretty sure this
brush is from eBay and I got it in a
pack ages ago and ever since I've got it
I've been using it for this exact reason
so yeah that's what I'm doing
okay so now I'm baking sky space with
Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm
just taking a lot of that product on my
Beauty Blender and packing it on and I'm
leaving it on for about two to three
minutes I don't like to keep it on for
that long otherwise it gets a bit true
white so yeah that's what I'm doing I'm
just putting that I do the eyes a little
bit on her chin and then taking my
favorite pressed powder which is the
Australia's fresh and flawless this one
is in the shade darkest Brown and this
is the one that I use mainly on myself
and tan a client and if you don't
already know it's my favorite powder of
all time I would highly suggest you go
out and get it and try it for yourself
because seriously I've tried all the
high-end ones and this one is by far my
favorite so as you can see I'm rubbing
off the excess powder from the baked as
well and then I'm also setting the
eyelids with the same powder just with a
little and I'm pretty sure this one's
the elf blush brush actually and then
I'm filling in her brows using the new
Brad definer by Anastasia Beverly Hills
I love this
brow pencil oh my god you guys need it
in your life and then I decided to go
over it with my brow kit also by Anasazi
Beverly Hills and I'm using the colored
tap worked all I seriously still don't
know how to pronounce that color and
just going over the starts of her brow
and brushing them out and then I'm
carving out her brows using the light
concealer the Maybelline fit me the one
that I used before and as you can see it
just gives more of a defined line and
then I'm just using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills clear brow gel to set to
the brows in place so the browser I use
is the hoola bronzer by benefit and I
use that with the Sigma I think it's e
angled contour brush I'll leave
everything down below anyways and what
I'm doing first is just warming up her
cheeks on her forehead her temples and
then I dragged a little bit on her
jawline and underneath her lip
so now I'm contouring her nose I'm using
sort of like a narrow fluffy brush I
seriously don't know what this is called
but I know I got it from eBay ages ago
in a brush set I'll try and find it and
leave the link down below for you guys
and now I am contouring her face a
little bit more I'm just using a zoeva
luxe face paint brush which is one of my
favorite contouring brushes ever I'm
just defining her cheekbones a little
bit more and now I'm going to bake her
contour so I'm just using a contouring
brush that I've never used actually for
contouring because it's just a little
bit too dense so I'm using that packing
on the Laura Mercier translucent powder
as you can see I'm doing a line from the
bottom of her ear to the edge of her
mouth and popping a little bit on the
bridge of her nose on her forehead and a
little bit on her chin I don't like to
keep this on for a long time I maybe
keep it on for 30 seconds to a minute
and then brush off the excess with a
stippling brush so for blush I'm using
the benefit coralista blush this is my
favorite blushes of all time because
it's coral and I'm obsessed with cold
washes oh my god I'm not really a fan of
pinky pink blushes I don't know why I
just think coral just looks amazing on
everyone so that is what I'm using I'm
using this on a blush brush Fiser Eva as
well so for highlighter I'm using the
gleam glow kit by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and I'm using the shade crushed
pearl I believe and oh my god how nice
are these highlighters I can't get over
it when I first receive these in the
mail I use them straight away and they
just did
the point so I'm putting that on the
highest point of her cheekbones a little
bit as made her brow bone Cupid's bow
and down the bridge of her nose okay so
for eyes I'm firstly taking creme brulee
by makeup geek and I'm just using that
on a massive fluffy brush and blending
that through to a crease and this is
just going to act as a transition shade
and then I'm also taking makeup geeks
Coco bear and I'm using that on my Mac -
one seven brush and I'm mainly packing
that on the outer corners of the eye and
blending that here so now I'm taking the
Too Faced natural eyes palette and I'm
taking the color honeypot which is a
gorgeous gold color I'm spritzing my
brush with some fix+
and just placing that on the inner
corners of the eyes
so now I'm taking this gold Mac pigment
I'm not sure what the name of it is
called but I'll leave it down below and
I've just sprayed my brush with a bit
more of fix+
and I'm just dabbing that over the gold
so now using the Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette I'm using the
shades pudding and hot fudge and I'm
just placing it on the out of these of
the eyes and blending that out with my
Mac two one seven brush and then I'm
taking the matte black eyeshadow from
the palette which is called licorice and
just placing that on the out of these
again and blending it out
so for the waterline I'm using the
Maybelline eye studio gel pot liner in
black and I've always used gels in the
waterline I just feel that it holds
better than a pencil so I'm just
applying that with a sigma winged liner
brush so here I'm just using a small
tapered brush and I'm just using the
shade hot fudge from the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and I'm blending
that into the waterline I'm just taking
a larger fluffy brush and diffusing it
so it looks nice and smoky so to
highlight the brow bone and inner
corners I'm using the unassertive
Beverly Hills glow kit again and I'm
using the crushed pearl color so the
lash brand that I typically use on
myself and my clients is called model
rock lashes which is an Australian brand
and it is absolutely amazing I love the
style to 1to and I basically use that on
most of my clients and the lash glue
that I use every time is the house of
lashes lash glue it's the best book ever
I haven't found anything that beats it
then I just use a disposable mascara
wand to blend in her lashes with the
falsies and then I also obviously apply
some to her bottom lashes I'm so so
sorry guys but I don't know where the
clip went when I did her lips but I use
the MAC store lip liner with Mac fast
fight lipstick over the top so yeah
