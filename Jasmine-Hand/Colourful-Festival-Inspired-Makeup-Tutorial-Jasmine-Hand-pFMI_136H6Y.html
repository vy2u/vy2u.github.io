so I'm going to get straight into it I'm
starting with eyes first I'm going in
with one of the new Smashbox actually I
don't know if they're like really new
but the first time I've ever tried it is
one of the Smashbox eyeshadow primers
and it's just the white one and then I'm
just going over that with some Rimmel
stay matte translucent powder just to
set that all in place then I'm taking me
morphe 35c palette and I'm taking the
bright orange I'm using that as a
transition color just on a large fluffy
brush and I'm just using windscreen
wiper motions in my crease that I'm
taking the red and also putting that in
the same spot
but I'm taking this really pretty public
color and I'm just mainly focusing that
on the outer corners of the eyes
and then I decided just to put it over
the whole lid as well and blending it in
with the orangey ready tones in the
crease
so then to cut half the craze I'm just
taking some Maybelline fit me concealer
this one's just in the shade light just
on a concealer brush and just carving
out my crease
then I'm taking the makeup geek Firefly
pigment and I'm just placing that
directly over the top and just leaving a
little line in between the concealer and
the pigment just so I can put the like
the glitter you'll see you later though
then just taking a little bit more of
the purpley color and kind of
intensifying that outer corner just
because we lost some color in the
blending process that I'm just taking
some duo lash glue and just putting that
along the line that we just created some
room for and then I'm taking just some
craft glitter this is probably from like
crazy Clark's or Stax so yeah it's not
like completely isafe but I've worn this
on my eyes plenty of times I've never
had a problem then for lino I'm just
going in with one of the Lime Crime
lines I can't remember what the name of
its called I'll make sure I'll leave it
in the description box down below I'm
just creating a wing
then I'm just taking a makeup wipe and
just cleaning up the edges just from the
fallout
the famous car I'm just taking a knee
newbomb cosmetics line I come about what
the name of its call but it's just in a
blue tube and I really like it so far
and then for lashes I'm just taking at
these ones by lash warrior I'll leave
the name down below because I forgot
what style it's in and just popping them
on
I'm two-faced and taking this makeup
forever prime I've never used it before
I think it's supposed to like color
correct your face it went really purple
and I was like freaking out and then I
went to go blender and it was all good
then I'm taking the new Marc Jacobs
illuminizer and just placing that on the
high points of my face so cheekbones
Cupid's bow and then down the bridge and
center of my nose just for something
different
and because I wanted a really
full-coverage look today I went with the
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation in the
shade 46 and just blending it in with a
morphe brush
then for concealer I'm taking the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard and displacement underneath my
eyes and then going ahead to putting it
on at the center of my face so Cupid's
bow down the bridge of my nose and a bit
on my chin and then blending it out
then taking the Kat Von D shade and
light palette I'm just taking the banana
shade and just using that and pressing
it in to my undereyes to set the
concealer and then to set the rest of my
face and just taking the Austral as
fresh and flawless face powder in the
shade medium tan on a large fluffy brush
then going in with one of my favorite
bronzes at the moment it's a Marc Jacobs
one I'll leave the name a listed down
below the cut remember from that of my
head but I'm also using the brush that
it came with its super huge and it just
like gets the right spots for bronzing I
really really like it so yeah I'm just
placing that on my cheeks around my
forehead as well
then taking my a hula bronzer by benefit
and just using that to further contort
my cheeks just with an angled brush and
then cleaning up that contour I'm just
using some face of Australia translucent
powder just on an angled beauty blender
this one's a real techniques one and yes
just creating a line directly underneath
then taking this Anasazi Beverly Hills
peachy blush trio while that was a
tongue twister and just placing that on
the apples of my cheeks that I'm taking
the new huda beauty summer palette and
oh my god it's so pretty I'm obsessive
the formula of these thunders placing a
Goldy color just on the tops of my
cheekbones and then I go ahead and try
the purple because I really want to see
what it looks like on so I'm just taking
that and I'm just putting that over the
top it wasn't as intense as I thought it
would be but it still gives a really
nice like iridescent like purpley sort
of color which I loved
so now finishing off the eyes I'm just
taking this aqua and I'm just really
pressing that into my lower lash line
just with a really narrow brush and then
going ahead in with a bigger brush just
to smoke it out a little bit more
and then because I couldn't find a pink
eyeliner I just used a pink lipliner
this one's just an urban decay one it
worked perfectly fine I'm just placing
that into my waterline and I'm taking
this Australia's metallic eyeshadow it's
like a cream eyeshadow that I've been
obsessed with my inner corners so I'm
just placing that just with a lip brush
onto my inner corners obsessed with how
intense it looks love it and then I'm
just placing some mascara on my bottom
lashes as well
so then to add the glid tears all I used
was the duo lash glue and I just use
that on a little pencil notice as a lip
brush actually and I just place that
underneath my eyes first and then all I
did was just packed on the glitter this
glitter that I use specifically I got
from spotlight recently so I got some
blue some pink and some gold and I just
put them all together and I think it
looked really really cool
you
Philips I just used a lip liner by urban
decay I can't remember what the color
was called but I'll leave it loose down
below as always and just lining up my
lips first and lip color I used was the
Anasazi Beverly Hills Dolce at liquid
lipstick and yeah just filling in my
lips with this
then taking one of the new huda beauty
lip strobe lip glosses and just clean
that over top these glasses are so
metallic and intense I love them I
probably wouldn't be gave enough to wear
them like on an everyday basis but
because it's like a festival inspired
look I thought it would go really well
and then I don't know why I did this but
I just added some extra like glitter
onto the middle of my lip so if everyone
seems to be doing it this festival
season but I kind of wish I did inks it
went everywhere especially when I
started talking and then I just spray my
face a bit of the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and that is the
look done I hope you guys enjoyed
watching I'm sorry I couldn't get this
up before splendor but I guess you guys
can use this for anything any upcoming
festivals so yeah I thought I would
still upload it for you guys thanks so
much for watching I love you guys so
much and I'll see you the next one bye
