so I'm going to get straight into it I'm
using some benefit cosmetics brow
products I just use their brow primer to
start off with then going in with the
browsing brow palette I'm just taking
the powder shade this one's in the shade
for for those that are wondering and
just filling them in with my pretty
cosmetics eyebrow brush then just taking
a light concealer and using that to
define the brows I didn't really put
that many clips in of me doing this
because I'm sure you've seen me do it a
million times
then I'm just going in with the benefit
3d brow tones true it's set to my brows
in place then I also tried out their 3d
brow pop I'm pretty sure which is just
for highlighting the brow bone so I'm
just placing that underneath there then
going in with the benefit Porefessional
as my primer and then use the new Urban
Decay prep and prime spray it actually
smells not so good then the foundation
I'm going with a Stila stay all day in
the shade 9 my favorite foundation at
the moment and buffing that all in with
my favorite morphe brush I still can't
remember what the brush is called but
I'll leave it listed down below as
always so yeah I'm just using that to
blend the foundation in then going in
with the Urban Decay weightless
concealer in the shade light neutral and
just placing that underneath my eyes
chin Cupid's bow a little bit on my
forehead and then down the bridge of my
nose and then I've decided to do a
little bit of cream contouring as well
so I use this heart-shaped 8 concealer
in the shade deep and just place that in
the areas where I would typically
contour so in the hollows of my
cheekbones around my forehead and then a
little bit on my jaw and then blending
it all out
you
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder and just using that
underneath my eyes to bake the concealer
and to set it in place then going in
with the australia's fresh and flawless
face powder in the shade medium tan up
always and setting the rest of my
foundation then using this zoeva palette
I come over what the name of it is
called rally that listed down below I'm
taking the gray shade and using that in
my crease first for a transition and
then I'm taking the lavender and
basically placing that in my crease as
well and upper crease area then taking
this makeup geek eyeshadow and just
mainly focusing that on the outer
corners of my eyes then I'm just taking
the black from the palate and also
placing that on the outer corners as
well and then also placing that below my
lower lash line
then taking this Stila cream eyeshadow
and placing that on the inner corners of
the eyes and oh my god this color was
amazing I can't member it from from my
head but I'll leave it
lift it down below holy and I was
so easy to blend as well as you can see
like they didn't go flaky or it wasn't
like hard to use obsessed I'm definitely
going to have to buy a couple more
shades I definitely want to gold I think
it would look amazing so I just thought
I would seem to go up so you can see the
true color so obsessed love it then I'm
just wiping off some Bacon's that I use
to clean up the sides of the eyeshadow
then taking this color pop highlighter
and placing that on my inner corners and
it worked really really well I probably
wouldn't use it as a cheekbone highlight
because it's a formula but for inner
corners it was amazing then taking the
new Marc Jacobs eyeliners I don't know
what color this is I think it's more of
a darker gray sort of color but I'll
leave the actual color of the pencil
listed down below for you guys and then
I'm just taking the black eyeshadow
again just on a more narrow brush and
just using that to smoke out the lower
lash line then taking the two-faced
sketch marker which is one of my
favorite felt tip liners and just using
that to line the top of my eye I didn't
decide to do a wing because I wanted to
go with really dramatic lashes then I'm
using these urban wink lashes holy
that was so dramatic
obsessed then taking at the I'm doing
like really fast then taking the true
face sweetheart bronzer and using that
to bronze up my face one of my favorite
bronzes of all time
then I'm taking some of the laura
mercier translucent powder and just
using that to bake underneath the
contour to make it more defined then I'm
going in with the other side to Beverly
Hills so Hollywood highlighter and I've
missed this I actually lost it
misplaced it in my drawer somewhere only
found at the other day and I was like oh
my god I miss you it's like one of my
favorite highlighters ever so just place
not on the cheekbones Cupid's bow tip of
the nose and on the bridge then wiping
off that fake because I don't like to
keep it on for too long
then going in with stone lip liner by
Mac which is just a darkish kind of gray
color then Phillips I'm going in with
the new makeup geek lip creams or I
think they were liquid lipsticks I can't
remember but oh my gosh these are so
easy to apply and really moisturize on
the lips like they don't dry completely
matte but they don't really transfer
it's really hard to explain but yeah
really like in the formula I can't
remember what the shades called I'm
hopeless but I'll leave it listed down
below so I went in with the darker sort
of gray purple and then I went in with
that lighter pinky color in the center
of my lips to make the illusion of
bigger lips then I'm just using the
urban decay or another setting spray and
that is the final look done I hope you
guys enjoyed watching it's something a
little bit different and a bit out of my
comfort so I would say comfort zone but
like I wouldn't usually wear these
colors so I hope you guys enjoy watching
and if you did please don't forget to
give it a thumbs up for me and I'll see
you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
