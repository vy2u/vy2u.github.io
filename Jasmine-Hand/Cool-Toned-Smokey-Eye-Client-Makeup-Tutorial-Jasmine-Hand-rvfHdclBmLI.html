I'm going to get straight into it for
moisturizer I'm just using the benefit
one I love the consistency and the smell
of this it's amazing
so just applying that evenly all over
her face then I'm taking the iconic
London illuminating drops and just
placing that in the places I would
normally highlight because I'm obsessed
with these drops they're amazing so I'm
just using a damp Beauty blender to
blend them all into the skin
then taking Mac Studio Fix Foundation
and MC 35 with the Bekaa illuminating I
think it's a skin Perfector in opal
blending their two together and applying
that as foundation just with a damp
Beauty Blender
you
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and just
placing that underneath her eyes to
conceal and highlight then placing it on
her chin Cupid's bow a bit on a forehead
down the bridge of my nose and then
blending it all in
now taking the laura mercier translucent
powder and just packing that on at my
damp Beauty Blender and just placing it
directly underneath the eyes
and then to set the rest of us am taking
the knob press powder in the shade beach
I've really been liking this powder
lately and yet just placing that all
over her face
then I'm just using the benefit
cosmetics browsing palette and taking
the shade on the left it's in the shade
four and just using that to fill in her
brows
then undertaking some light concealer
and just using that to define the upper
and lower Prowse
then taking the benefit cosmetics 3d
brow tones and just using that to run
through a browse to set them in place
now taking these out of a cool spectrum
eyeshadow palette I'm taking the top
left which was just a matte gray and
just using that as a transition color in
the crease with a large fluffy brush
then I'm taking the Urban Decay Gwen
Stefani palette and taking the darker
gray it's also matte and just mainly
focusing that on the outer corners of
her eyes
then taking the matte black out of the
palette as well and I'm just using that
to intensify the attic wanted a little
bit more
you
then going back in with the zoeva called
spectrum palette I'm taking the matte
white and holy hell this was super
pigmented and I'm placing that on the
inner corners of her eyes and then just
blending it out
then just taking some translucent powder
on an angled wedge and just using that
through define the sides of the
eyeshadow now taking one of the new Marc
Jacobs eyeliners it's just a cobalt blue
I'll leave the color down below and I'm
just placing that in her waterline
so I'm just going in with those first
two gray shades that we used earlier
just on her lower lash line then under
taking a more narrow brush with the
black and just really pressing that into
the lower lash line and then I go ahead
to blend it with the blue out of the
Urban Decay Gwen Stefani palette
then taking jeffree star cosmetics
ice-cold highlighter and just using that
for her inner corners then for gel liner
and taking the Maybelline eye studio in
the shade black just on my zoeva winged
liner brush and just creating a thin
line on the top of the eyes
then going in with the black again on a
pencil brush and really smudging out the
liner on the outer corners
then I'm just going in and coating her
lashes with some mascara and then also
falsies I can't remember which style I
used but I'll leave them listed down
below as always then taking the Too
Faced sweetheart bronzer and placing
that in the hollows of her cheeks and a
little bit above just with an angled
brush then I go ahead to place it on her
temples down the sides of her nose and
draw a line as well
then taking a whole lot by benefit to
contour and displacing that in the
hollows of her cheekbones her jaw and
then around her temples as well then
just taking some translucent powder on
my Beauty Blender just to bake
underneath the contour so it looks more
defined then taking the peachy blush out
of these zoeva blush palette and just
placing that on the apples of her cheeks
and then just finishing off the eye look
with some mascara on her lower lashes
taking an old favorite highlighter so
hollywood by anastasia beverly hills and
just platon that on the cheekbone area
Cupid's bow down the tip and bridge of
her nose as well
then just wiping off the excess
translucent powder from underneath the
bake and then to line our lips I'm just
using share lip line up by Gerard I
literally use this on pretty much every
client because it is so amazing and so
easy to apply
then taking the Too Faced melted matte
liquid lipstick I'm pretty sure this
one's in the shade cool girl if not I'll
leave it listed down below and just
using that to fill in her lips I thought
this color complemented the eye look
because it's kind of like a cool Toni
brown shade and I think she pulls it off
amazingly I mean like what could you not
pull off though so jealous of you girl
you're amazing so I'm just taking myths
by Mac and placement in the center for a
little bit of an ombre sort of feel to
the lips and then finishing off with the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and that is the final look I hope you
