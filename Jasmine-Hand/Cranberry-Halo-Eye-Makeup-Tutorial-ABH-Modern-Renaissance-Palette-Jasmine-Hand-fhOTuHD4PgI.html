since you came in hey guys and welcome
back to my channel so I'm going to get
straight into it for primer I used the
benefit that gal primer this one's
actually a brightening primer so it's
amazing for people with drier skin or if
you just want a really nice judaize I
really really love this primer I've only
just started using it recently and then
I'm just spraying her face with a bit of
mac fix+
femme fatale nation I'm using Mac Studio
Fix in nw20 and I'm just buffing that
all over a face with a damp Beauty
Blender
you
then to color correct the purple enos
underneath her eyes I'm using the la
girl Pro concealer in the orange color
and as you can see I'm just placing that
underneath her eyes and blending it out
with a damp Beauty Blender and then to
conceal and highlight her face I'm using
the Urban Decay weightless skin
concealer in the shade light neutral I'm
pretty sure I'll leave it listed down
below if it's not I'm just placing that
in a triangle underneath her eyes will
actually upside down triangle Cupid's
bow chin down the bridge of her nose and
a little bit on her forehead
then to set the concealer I'm using the
Laura Mercier translucent powder to bake
and I'm just packing that on my Beauty
Blender and placing that underneath her
eyes
then to set the rest of our face amusing
the estrela's fresh and flawless as
always in the shade natural and just
dabbing that all over her face
then for brows I'm taking my own estar Z
Beverly Hills pro brow kit and I'm using
the shade dark brown and I'm just using
that on my pony cosmetics eyebrow brush
and filling in her eyebrows
and then to sculpt the brows i'm just
using the Urban Decay Naked concealer
again just the same shade that we used
to conceal just using that on a
concealer brush and as you can see I'm
just going straight underneath her
eyebrows then I'm also just using some
of that same concealer again as a I
prime ur
and just buffing that into her eyelids
and then I go ahead and just take some
more of the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and pack that over the lid to it
set the concealer then to set the brows
I'm going in with the benefit gimme brow
and this is in the darker shade and I
actually really love this product I only
just started recently using this on my
clients and I love love love the way it
looks and then going in with my haul up
bronzer by benefit just on my Mac I
think it's one three five I don't know
I'll leave it listed down below I can
never remember what type of brush this
is but it's amazing for bronzing so I'm
just placing that in the hollows of her
cheekbones and then I go ahead and place
it on her jaw line and then around her
temples and then I contour our nose a
little bit with it as well
then to bake a contour I'm using at the
laura mercier translucent powder just on
an angled sponge and as you can see I'm
just going directly underneath the
contour and then after a minute or so
I'm just brushing off that excess powder
because I don't like to keep it on for
too long then for blush I'm using lemak
petal power this is so amazing it's kind
of like a peachy pink with like a sheen
to it it's so amazing it's so similar to
the balm hot mama
and then for highlight I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Sun dipped glow
kit and I'm using the shade moonstone
and just placing that on her cheekbones
Cupid's bow tip of her nose down the
bridge of her nose
and this brush is actually the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills highlighting
brush I always get questions asking
which brush it is but yeah it's the UH
Nastasia one so for eyes I'm using the
modern renaissance palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills and first up I'm going in
with burnt orange and using that as a
transition shade and just buffing that
into her crease
then I'm taking love letter which is the
most amazing pinky cranberry color and
I'm just working that on her outer
corner and into her crease
and then I'm going in with the matte
brown shade which is called Cypress boom
bar and I'm just packing that on the
inner and outer corners to make that
halo I look
so after I've packed on the dark brown
color I'm just going in with a clean
blending brush and blending all the
harsh edges
then taking primavera which is the most
gorgeous champagne e gold color it's so
amazing and pigmented I'm just placing
that on the center of her eyelid and
then for the lower lash line I'm
starting off with love-letter and I'm
just using that on a small tapered
blending brush and just buffing that
into her lower lash line
and then to darken things up a bit I'm
going in with Cypress boom bar again and
I'm just also putting that on the lower
lash line
to highlight the inner corners and brow
bone I'm taking primavera again
seriously one of my favorite shades of
this whole palette and then I'm coating
her top lashes with some mascara I just
used the pony cosmetics white night
mascara and then for lashes I'm using
the model rock true one true lashes I'll
leave everything listed down below for
you guys anyways and I'm just placing
that on with some duo lash glue
then I'm just using a liquid liner this
is the NYX one and I'm just using that
to hide the lash glue and just to make
sure everything is all nicely blended
and black and then I'm going in with the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and I'm
using that to line her waterline
and then I'm grabbing makeup geeks
corrupt matte black eyeshadow I'm just
using that on a really fine eyeliner
brush and densely packing that just
underneath where we lined her waterline
just to make it a little bit more smoky
and then going in with a blending brush
to smoke everything all out
and then of course going in for round
two with highlighter I'm just using that
same highlighter we used before which
was the UH Nastasia Sun dipped glow kit
in the shade moonstone then for lips I'm
taking the drug cosmetics nude lip liner
this is honestly one of my favorite nude
lip liners of all time they're super
creamy and pigmented and look amazing on
and then the lipstick I used is also by
Gerard cosmetics it's called buttercup
and it is again one of my favorite and
most popular shades ever and then I'm
just going over them with a clear glass
this one's just by Rimmel I'll leave the
name down below and then I'm going in
with some mascara again and coaching her
lower lashes so this is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed watching and
learnt something new don't forget to
