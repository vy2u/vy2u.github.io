channel it feels like so long since I've
actually sat down and spoken while I was
doing my makeup it felt so weird but
feels so good to get back into it so I
filmed this a makeup look using the
Buddha Beauty rose gold I think it's
called a visit the rose gold textured
eyeshadow pallete rose gold edition
palette and I like I'm obsessed I think
this is my favorite palette I own now
these eyeshadows are incredible like you
will see my first impressions of them
when I put it on I'm just like I'm not
even blending and it's already blended
like these amazing I love love love how
this eye look turned out so if you'd
like to see how I created this cranberry
rose gold I don't know I just never know
what to call it tutorials but if you'd
like to see how I created this look then
just keep on watching so primer I'm
gonna go in with the benefit
Porefessional the matte rescue one it's
amazing for oily skin I always use it on
my clients so I'm just gonna work that
into the skin by the way don't mind my
dodgy fake tan application on my hands
and then just fill in the pores around
my nose I'm just using the benefit
Porefessional the original one the
foundation I'm gonna mix my George
Armani luminous silk in the shade of 5.5
with the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation in the shade 54 the only
reason why I mix them is because this
one's kind of a little bit like pinky
based whereas this one's yellow eBay so
I just like to mix in a little bit of
this one just because my fake tans like
yellow base not pink based so yeah and I
also like to add this in with my
foundations because it adds a lot of
coverage you're only like two or three
little drops of it it's so good so I'm
gonna mix these up gonna do two squirts
of this on the back of my hand I'm just
going to put like two drops like that
maybe three
just gonna mix them up next time every
purchase the Giorgio Armani I think I'm
gonna get shade six but I was just too
scared cuz when i swatched in store i
bought this like months ago it just
looked so dark and the guy that was
wearing it was like very heavily fake
tan and I was like oh that's not usually
how dark I go but I think I'm gonna buy
that color and even if it's too dark I
can just lighten it up with my lighter
foundation so I'm just gonna dot that
all over I've also found my new favorite
foundation brush I know I don't usually
use brushes but this one is like amazing
so the brush I've been obsessed with is
the morphe Emma for 3:9 just looks like
this it's so good I don't know I've
never used a brush like this before and
then I'm just going to like that is
already blended and I basically didn't
even do anything it's so good
okay so after I buffed it all in with
the brush I still go in with a damp
Beauty Blender just because I feel like
it just makes it look even more flawless
so if I concealer I'm gonna use the top
shape tape concealer in the shade
light/medium and I'm just going to I
still can't get over how huge the
freaking applicator is like that is just
crazy actually I'm gonna get my
Maybelline fit me and it show you guys
and compare them because it's freaking
crazy I don't even know if that's
focused or not but this one's the Tarte
one and then this one is the maybelline
one like what the hell and I'm just
placing a few dots underneath my eye so
I'm just blending that in
and then I'm just gonna use my
Maybelline fit me to highlight the
center in my face I feel like that one's
a little bit too like thick and full
coverage for just highlighting so I'm
just placing that just down the center
of my face and just blending it out I'm
gonna cream contour a little bit because
I feel like my face needs like warming
up so I'm gonna take the top shape tape
concealer in the shade deep not gonna
lie I'm my pants couldn't ever
usually do this but I thought that dark
okay because it's not as bad as I
thought
plates a little bit along my jaw as well
cuz I don't really have one I'll just
take a few dots around my forehead
should I go down my nose yeah we're
doing it oh my god
I did it so wrong over dead I would
laugh so hard if this actually turned
out decent okay it's not too bad I've
used this concealer before to UM cream
contour and I really liked it it looks
really natural and then my jaw actually
really liked the look of this cream
contour being true blend around my
forehead so now I'm just taking some
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
using that to bake underneath just so it
doesn't crease
by the way I've been baking my nose like
this recently and I feel like my face
doesn't get as Whaley when I do that I
mean it's because the powder absorbs the
oil I don't know it but it's working for
me so you guys should try it if you get
oily skin hello
I'm still filming I'm almost done okay
bye
I'm so not almost done I always say that
now I'm just taking the Australis fresh
and floors it's actually shattered and I
don't have another medium tan with me so
I'm gonna have to make do with this low
I think I might just oh yeah there's
some like loose powder in the lid that I
might use I was gonna use that to set
the rest of my face a couple of I just
said I'm almost done he's gonna get here
and be like okay I'm gonna go in with
brows and just taking my dip brow back
on the stasi in the shade soft brown and
just lightly kind of fill in my brows I
need to get them threaded ASAP I've got
a question on my last video asking why I
do brows first usually I like to do
brows first because I like to shape them
and then I like to use concealer like
above and below them and I feel like
once you set the face with powder the
concealer doesn't sit like nicely like
you wouldn't ever put concealer over a
powdered face if you know I mean so
that's why I like to do brows first cuz
I like to conceal around them on myself
I forget and I always just go in to face
first but on clients that would always
do brows first for that reason whatever
I'm doing thing is this year I'm going
to Newcastle to see Brittany I'm so
excited to get out of the Gold Coast
I've been literally here for like my
whole life and I think I've ever been
anywhere else for in years so I'm so
excited I've just kind of made them a
tiny bit thinner because I literally
went a bit ham with the pomade
so you can kind of you probably can't
tell because you're so far away
but up close you can see the concealer
kind of sitting on top of the skin
because the powders already put down so
that's why I usually like to do brows
first so the concealer sits underneath
the powder if you get what I mean I'm
just taking a little bit more of that
translucent powder and just using that
to set my eyelids and then I'm just
taking a brush and wiping off the excess
powder from underneath my eyes
now I'm gonna bronze up the face using
the matte give me Sun I've recently
become obsessed with this I pretty much
use this like every time I do my makeup
now when I first bought it I was like
holy Shh this bronze is so orange but
like I like the color now it's just
grown on me so I'm just using a angled
brush this one's by iconic and I'm just
gonna use that to really bronze up the
face because I feel like it's really
flat and wide at the moment so I'm just
going over the areas that I come to it
earlier
underneath the lip then I'm going to use
the shade and light palette by Kat Von D
and I'm gonna take this middle shade
just using that on the same brush and
using that to define my cheeks a little
bit more so I'm just gonna like kind of
place that at the base with your bronzer
you want to sweep up not down by the way
I forgot to mention that again now I'm
just gonna take some more translucent
powder just on my Beauty Blender and I'm
just gonna use that to bake underneath
just to clean up the area so I just like
to put it on like that people always ask
me why I take it all the way down to the
side of my mouth cuz you can't see the
contacts I don't like bring the contour
down that far it's just kind of so I can
get it even really I've just always
don't like that I don't know I just
couldn't imagine just stopping halfway
because then it just would like look
weird to me so that's why I bring it all
the way down for blush I'm gonna take
the NARS orgasm blush it's like one of
my favorites at the moment it's so
pretty and I'm just gonna use that on
the apples of my cheeks so a highlighter
I've recently been obsessed with is the
laura geller baked gilded honey
highlighter which is like a gold it's so
nice and I'm using the a 23 brush by
Anastacio like look at that though den
is honestly like the best holiday brush
of all so dad just gonna place a little
bit on the tip
and then underneath my brow bone to
highlight it and it's a little bit above
then I'm just gonna take this powder
brush just to remove the bake and then I
just like blend everything together I
always feel so weird when I have my base
so I'm not my eyes but I'm gonna zoom
you guys up maybe like that so I
recently just received the new huda
beauty rose gold palette I literally
received it from Sephora and I was like
dead like it's so pretty like look at
that okay I really really really want to
use that fleeting shade which is like a
cranberry color because I've been using
like cranberry Pink's on my eyes lately
and I feel like it really brings out my
brown eyes for some reason I'm gonna
take scandal would just on a big fluffy
brush and use that in the crease oh my
god I'm so excited I'm just gonna buff
that into the crease Wow these shadows
blend really nice but now I'm gonna take
shy which is kind of like it's like a
pale pastel dusty pink color and I'm
also gonna put that into the crease just
because we're gonna be working with like
cranberry colors so I just want it to
blend nicely into a color similar in the
crease then I think I'm gonna take bossy
which is just like a really really
pretty rich brownie red color and I'm
also gonna sweep that into the crease as
well these shadows oh my god they're
amazing okay I'm gonna go in with that
really pretty cranberry color okay
that's what the color looks like so
nice I'm just gonna oh my god what
that's amazing placing that a little bit
of fallout but that's alright because we
baked earlier and it should just wipe
straight off holy crap this color is so
pretty I can't deal it's gonna use a
brush to get into the inner corner cuz
I've got fake nails on gonna go in with
that same brush that we used earlier
just to blend out any harsh lines it's
gonna start on my lower lash line and
take the same two colors that I used in
the crease and just blend them
underneath I'm gonna go in with the
shade henna which is really similar to
Anastasi as Morocco I'm gonna take cocoa
which is the really pretty rich brown
color and just kind of work that into
the outer corner I really want to use
the black out of it as well and see how
good it is so I'm gonna take black
truffle and see how good this black is
I'm just putting that on the outer
corners not bad by in with the original
og
blending brush and just use that to like
basically blend everything all together
I really want to use this angelic color
in my inner corners so I think I'm gonna
grab that it's just like a really like
light pink oh my god
I might actually put it all over
that color just gave me life that I'm
just gonna take moondust
and use that to highlight my inner
corners it's intense
I'm gonna use the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner but I'm gonna mix in a little
bit of the Anastasio hydrating oil
because it's like dry so just gonna put
one drop of that in now I'm going to go
in with the liner
and then
I'm just going in with some mascara I
actually have some huda beauty eyelashes
