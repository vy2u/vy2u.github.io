so today's client tutorial will be on
this gorgeous cranberry smokey eye which
I made with the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and I'm just going to get
straight into the tutorial so to prime
of course I'm using the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue primer it's
new and it's freaking amazing
for people with oily skin Emma's said
she has slightly oily skin she gets oily
down her t-zone when she wears makeup so
that's why I chose that primer and then
I always spritz my clients face with a
bit of fix+ before foundation and the
foundation I'm using is the Mac Studio
Fix in NC 37 and I've got to say that
this shade is probably the most popular
shade I use in my kit for clients that
have fake tan on or a tanned like Emma
and I find that the majority of my
clients are like Emma's sort of color so
this color is literally like the perfect
match for a fake tan so as you can see
I'm just applying it first with a
concealer brush and then buffing it out
with a damp Beauty Blender
I've also decided for this video that
I'm not going to speed anything up so
I'm going to show you what happens in
real time like how long it actually take
to do everything I've just kind of
cropped out the bits where I'm actually
grabbing the products but usually I can
do a client space in 35 to 40 minutes
for those that are wondering and then to
hide her dark circles I'm using the la
girl Pro concealer in the orange
corrector and this works so well Evan
Lee use this on a few clients and I love
the way that it just literally color
corrects the dark circles and then after
you put concealer on it it's like
nothing ever happened it's amazing
and then to conceal I'm using the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in custard and
as you can see I'm just applying that
with a concealer brush straight
underneath her eyes and then I go ahead
and pop it on her forehead down the
bridge of her nose Cupid's bow and on a
chin and then I blend it out with a
Beauty Blender
and then to set her concealer I'm baking
using the laura mercier transmen powder
and I'm just using that on the same
beauty blender as I used on her face and
then to set the rest of her face I'm
using the estrela's fresh and flawless
face powder in darkest Brown by the way
leave a comment down below if I've
converted you to this powder or you've
tried it because of me because I always
get snapchat saying oh my god I just
bought the Australia special floors it's
amazing thank you so I want to know how
many people actually went out and bought
it anyways
so now I'm just brushing off the excess
bake don't mind my head in front of the
camera I'm going to work out angle soon
I'm just brushing that off with a large
stippling brush and then for brows I'm
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills Pro
brow palette and I use the shade tap and
then I think I mix it with a bit of
blonde as well and then I'm just going
ahead and filling in her brows and I'm
using the pony cosmetics eyebrow brush
it is my Holy Grail eyebrow brush ever
I'll leave the link down below where you
can get it from and yeah you can just
watch me fill in her brows
you
and then to clean up the brows i'm just
using the maybelline fit me concealer in
light on a concealer brush and just
literally going straight underneath the
brow this literally makes the brow look
perfect like I'm so glad that I like
this technique I'm pretty sure I saw it
on Instagram or something but literally
it makes the biggest difference I'm so
sorry I lost half the footage of me
bronzing and contouring her face but
basically I'm using the hoola by benefit
bronzer on the mac 135 brush and just
bronzing and contouring her cheeks if
you're wondering how I bronze and
contour on clients I do have other
client videos where I show you more in
depth so yeah and then I'm just
contouring her nose using hoola as well
and then I'm baking her contour using
the face of Australia trans and powder
the only reason why I don't use the
Laura Mercier one is because of the
price difference this one's like seven
dollars the Laura Mercier one's like $60
so I just like to use this to bake the
contour so the blush I wanted something
really nice and glowy so I chose the hot
mom up by the balm I love this blush
mousse it's got shimmer in it and it
just makes the cheeks look amazing and
the highlighter I'm using is my Holy
Grail which is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills so Hollywood and I'm just applying
that on the top of her cheekbones with
the Anastasia Beverly Hills highlighting
brush which is also my Holy Grail
and then just using that large stippling
brush from before and I'm just brushing
off the excess powder from the baked
I'm taking the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette I'm taking that shade and I'm
using that as a transition shade and
buffing it into her crease
you
then taking that first highlighter I
like to use it as eyeshadow as well like
you can use as a highlighter or an
eyeshadow which i think is amazing and
I'm just packing that all over her
mobile lid
then I'm just taking that darker movie
color and I'm using that to define her
crease a little bit more and I'm using a
zoeva it's kind of like a jute for the
Mac - one seven brush I'll leave it
listen down below it's actually such a
good brush it's actually one of my
favorites so I'm just using that to put
on the outer V and then I'm just using a
bigger blending brush to blend it all
seamlessly together and then finally
using the darkest shade in the palette
and I'm just basically concentrating
that on the outer corners of her eye
just because I like the whole light to
dark effect so yeah I've just packed
that on and then I'm just blending it in
all together the four winged liner I'm
using the Maybelline eye studio in black
and I'm just using that on a zoeva
winged liner brush and I'm just starting
by lining her eyes and then I'm creating
a wing I'm thinking about doing a how to
winged line on a client video like a
really short but in-depth video on how
to do it just because you can't really
see me doing it like from this angle so
let me know if you'd like to see a video
on that
I actually did also line her blood alone
with the Maybelline eye studio as well
but my face was basically in the whole
frame so I decided to cut that out but
I'm just smoking out her lower lash line
with that darker movi color and then I'm
going to apply some mascara I think
that's what's up next yeah I'm going to
apply mascara and I use the benefit
roller lash or sometimes I use the pony
cosmetics white light mascara they're
both my favorite for clients and
obviously using that on a disposable
mascara wand so the lashes I'm using the
model rock 2 1 2 s which are definitely
one of my favorites in my kit I just
purchased them straight from the model
rock website and I use I may not use I
buy the bulk pack so it's like $90 for
50 pairs and then I'm lining her lips
with Mac's or lip liner and then the
lipstick that I chose was faux by back
as well
and then I'm just cutting her lower
lashes with some mascara as well and
then I'm also using that to blend her
falsies with her real lashes
so there you have it I hope you guys
enjoyed watching and learnt a few tips
and tricks don't forget that I do
actually have other client tutorials if
you're new to my channel so you should
definitely check them out but yeah I
guess I will see you in my next video
