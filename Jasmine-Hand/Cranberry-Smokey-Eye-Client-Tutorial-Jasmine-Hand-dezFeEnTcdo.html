so first I'm just going in with the
Guardian masala water just on a cotton
pad just to ensure the face is nice and
clean before moisturizing I'm using this
random moisturizer that I recently got
and loved it and I'm just applying that
all over her face and then I go in with
the Too Faced hangover primer and also
putting that all over
then going in with the under stars II
Beverly Hills pro brow palette I'm
taking the shade soft brown and using
that to fill in her eyebrows
then I'm just going in with the
Maybelline fit me concealer in light and
I'm just using that to sculpt out the
brows
then taking some mac fix+ and spraying
that all over and the foundation I'm
using is the tarte amazonian clay one of
my new favorites for my kit I'm using
the shade at tan Sam I believe I'll
leave it listed down below if it's not
the color but I love love this
foundation it literally is so flawless
and full coverage but doesn't look cakey
I just sometimes find if you apply too
much of the Mac Studio Fix it can look
cakey but this one you can literally
apply as much as you want and it won't
look cakey I just love the way it
settles into the skin so yeah really
loving that one and then I'm just going
in with the Maybelline fit me concealer
in light and just using that underneath
her eyes and then going ahead to putting
it on her chin Cupid's bow and then down
the bridge of a nose and a bit on a
forehead and then blending it all in
then I'm taking a mixture of the laura
mercier translucent powder and the RCM a
no color powder and just using that
underneath her eyes to bake the
concealer then just placing a little bit
more of the maybelline fitme concealer
on the eyelids to act as a primer and
then using some translucent powder to
set the eyelids in place
then taking the estrela's fresh and full
of space powder in the shade darkest
Brown and I'm just using that to set the
rest of her face fires I'm taking the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette and I'm taking the
shade burnt orange which is right there
and I'm using that in her crease as a
transition color
you
then taking makeup geeks frappe single
eyeshadow and just putting that mainly
on the outer corners and like lightly
sweeping it in the crease area just to
give it a little bit more definition
then taking a rose gold by Kylie
cosmetics and just placing that in the
inner corners of her eyes this is like
half empty guys and I'm freaking out
because it was limited edition and I
need something like this if you guys
know of any dupes please leave it in the
comments below I'm obsessed with this
color so I'm just really packing that on
the inner corners then I'm taking love
letter from also the modern renaissance
palette it's more of like a cranberry
color and just placing that straight
over the top of the rose gold cream
shadow and then I'm taking Cyprus Ambar
which was a really dark brown and just
using that and concentrating that on the
outer corners then also taking a burnt
orange which was a transition shade and
popping that in the lower lashline and
then I go ahead to use the ready and
pinky shade as well then going in with
the jeffree star cosmetics skin frost in
the shade ice-cold I always use this on
the inner corners it's so intense I love
it and just place it on the brow bone as
well
then I'm taking the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in the black and just
using that to line her upper lash line
and then I'm just going in with the
benefit they're real mascara on a
disposable mascara one and just coating
her top lashes in preparation for
falsies
the lashes I used were the model rock
lashes in the shade 236 it comes in a
bulk pack they're amazing and just
popping them on with some duo lash glue
then taking the Too Faced sweethearts
bronzer and using that to bronze up her
face I went for a really bronzy look
today so I'm just using that on her
cheekbones around her forehead on her
jaw line and then on the sides of her
nose
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder I'm just using that
to bake her contour just on my Beauty
Blender I'm just creating a line
directly underneath then taking the
gorgeous hourglass Holliday palette I'm
taking the blush and I'm just placing
that on the apples of her cheeks and
this blush was absolutely amazing I
can't wait to try the other colors from
the kit as well then taking this Oprah
highlighter in the shade Rodeo Drive and
using that on her cheekbones then I put
a little bit above her brow bone and
then Cupid's bow and tip of her nose as
well this highlighter is so amazing
I was actually going to leave her
waterline blank but I was like no that's
totally not me to keep the waterline
blank
especially with someone with a light
green eyes so I'm placing the Maybelline
eye studio gel liner in her waterline
then taking at Cypress umba and I'm just
using that on a flat definer brush and
really smudging that into her lower lash
line
then I'm taking the dried cosmetics nude
lipliner and obviously using that to
line her lips for lipstick I used
cherish by mark one of my favorites for
my kit it's been a really popular shade
when someone just asked for a nude lip
and it's just amazing so obviously I'm
just using that to fill in her lips and
then I just go over it with a clear
gloss the Rimmel one
so to set the face I'm just using the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and that is the final look done I hope
