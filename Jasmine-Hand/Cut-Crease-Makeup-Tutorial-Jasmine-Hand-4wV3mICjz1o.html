so first up I'm just going in with some
gun in the cellar water just to ensure
the face is nice and clean before primer
and the primer I'm using is the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue just because
she had oil ii skin and my absolute
favorite primer for oily skin denser
brows and going into the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Pro brow palette as always
and I'm using the shade soft brown just
with my pony cosmetics eyebrow brush to
fill in her brow as amazing brows to
start off with so it made it easy for me
then I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and I'm
just using that to define her brow so I
just use it on a flat concealer brush
and just run it above and below at the
brows
and then the spring her face a bit of
mac fix+ just before foundation and the
foundation i used was the Mac Studio Fix
fluid in NC 30 just throwing that all
over a face first and then blending it
all in with a damp Beauty Blender
then taking my fav concealer Maybelline
fit me in the shade light and using that
underneath her eyes to conceal and
highlight then I go ahead to place it on
a Cupid's bow chin it down the bridge of
her nose and a bit on a forehead and
then blending it out as well
then to set the concealer in place and
taking the laura mercier translucent
powder and just using that to bake
underneath her eyes and then to set the
rest of her face i take the Mac Studio
Fix powder in the shade n C 40 and just
setting the rest of her face
so I'm just taking some Muller Mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to set her eyelids in place just to
ensure that the eyeshadow blend
seamlessly so if I said oh I'm taking me
more feet brushes three five-oh pallet
taking that shade right there I wish
they had names because it's so annoying
and just using that as a transition
shade then taking this gorgeous bright
orange color I'm just using that also in
the crease as well
then taking this brownie ready shade I'm
also using that in the crease just to
give it a little bit more definition
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer again in light just on the
concealer brush and this is where we're
going to cut the crease so what I like
to do is just place some on the lid and
then I get the client to open because
then you can definitely see where the
skin fold is and then just going by that
you go ahead and try and cut the crease
you
then taking this gorgeous shimmery shade
I'm just plating that directly on the
lid
but I'm taking like a really really mini
blending brush just taking a little bit
more of that darker shade that we used
earlier throughout the crease and just
using that to really define the cut
crease line then taking the Tarte clay
paint liner this is the one in the pot
not in the tube I really like this is
the first time I used it really easy to
work with and super black and their
brush that I'm using is just the zoeva
winged liner brush which is like one of
my favorites so yeah I just did that and
then I'm wiping off the excess powder
from the bake and then I continue on and
do the wing
then taking the two-faced Sweethearts
bronzer I'm using that on an angled
brush and just even that to bronze up
the face
then taking the hoola bronzer by benefit
and just using that to further contour
her face and then I'm just going in with
the laura mercier translucent pad again
it just true a bake her contour then
taking Mac's pedal power blush and just
using that on her cheeks and now moving
on to underneath the eyes and just
taking that first transition color and
mixing it in with a little bit of the
orange and just smoking that on her
lower lash line then taking a more
defined like narrow brush and taking a
dark brown out of the palette and just
using that to smoke out her lower lash
line as well
then taking the pinky champagne II
shimmery color I'm using that to
highlight her inner corners and brow
bone and then using the taut liner again
I'm just using that in her waterline as
well
then taking a dark-brown from the pallet
again and really pressing that into the
lower lash line just to make it a little
bit more smokier and then go ahead with
a blending brush to blend it all out
then taking the benefit they're real
mascara on a disposable mascara wand and
just using that to coat her lashes in
preparation for false lashes and the
lashes that I use wedding model rock to
on twos and my absolute favorite I
pretty much use them on every client I
love them
then taking the time I'm pretty sure
this is a pro glow palette which is
relatively new so nice so pigmented and
I love the colors so I'm just placing
that on the high point of her cheekbone
down her Cupid's bow and then on to the
nose and I do fix up that eye shadow for
all of you OCD people out there I do end
up fixing it up
and then I'm going in with bottom lashes
and just using the benefit they're real
mascara again and then it to line my
lips I'm taking the dried cosmetic share
lip liner
then I'm taking the new Anasazi Beverly
Hills lip palette I'm taking the shade
number five and I didn't actually end up
mixing because I really really love this
shade and I thought a berry lip would
look really great with this eye makeup
look so I just ended up using that color
and Wow
the formula of these are amazing they're
super creamy I've actually tried them on
my own lips as well and love love them
so if you're a makeup artist and I
probably would recommend having one of
these in your kit I don't know how like
practical they'd be on someone that
isn't a makeup artist but definitely if
you're a makeup artist you need this
palette it's so good and then I just
ended up putting a clear gloss on top
and that is the end of the video I hope
