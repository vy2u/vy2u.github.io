so I'm gonna get straight into it for
brows I'm going in with the benefit
Cobra in the shade number six and just
using a pony cosmetics eyebrow brush to
fill in her brows
dan was taking the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade caramel and just
using that true to find her brow so I'm
just using a concealer brush and just
placing that above and below
that I'm taking at the Rimmel stay matte
translucent powder just because I did
put the excess concealer over the
eyelids as a base and now I'm just
setting that all in place with this
translucent powder just to ensure all
the eyeshadows blend seamlessly
then I'm just going in with a benefit
ready set brow clear brow gel true
action or not this is the 3d brow tone
sorry I'm in the shade number four then
I'm going in with the Anastasia Beverly
Hills soft glam palette and I'm taking I
think it's called Sienna and I'm
basically just working that into the
crease and on the outer corners with a
large fluffy brush
then I'm taking it the top right shape
which is just a darkish sort of red and
just mainly focusing that on the outer
corners of the eyes
then I'm taking the black and also
putting that on the outer corners of the
eyes as well just to give it a little
bit more definition
I'm also focusing at that black on the
inner crease area just because when we
cut the crease it'll look a little bit
more defined so that is what I'm doing
now I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade number 20 sand
and I'm just using that for the cut
crease so as you can see I'm just
literally cutting the area where her
crease is so hard to explain but I'm
sure you can see what I'm doing
but I'm just blending out they can see
light into the dark I shot it on the
outer corner just so it blends nicely
I'm taking at this nas pellet and I'm
taking this shimmery metallic color I'll
leave everything I listed down below and
I'm just popping that straight over the
top of the concealer
then I'm taking the white Urban Decay
liner I'm not sure the name but I'll
leave it listed down below and I'm
basically just going over the cut crease
area
then I'm just using the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in black and just using
that to create a wing
the lashes I'm taking the lashed ko
lashes I'll leave the stylus to down
below and just popping them on with some
duo lash glue now into base I'm firstly
just using a makeup wipe with some
masala water just to ensure her face is
nice and clean before priming I'm just
popping on the Tarte h2o gel moisturizer
after was called for a second and just
popping that on before primer
and the primer I'm using is the benefit
Porefessional
the foundation I'm taking the new NAS
one I still can't remember what it's
called I think it's the natural long
wearing foundation but I mixed two
shades
I'll leave listed down below I'm popping
up on her face first and then blending
it out with her damp Beauty Blender
then I'm taking the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade caramel and just
popping that underneath her eyes to
correct any dark circles underneath her
eyes and then I went over it with the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
20 to brighten up the area
and then I'm just blending it all in
to set the concealer I'm taking the
laura mercier translucent powder and
just packing that directly underneath
the eyes
then to set the rest of the face I'm
taking the Mac Studio Fix powder in the
shade NC 42 and just lightly brushing
that over your face
NAFA lower lashline I'm taking at the
same soft glam palette and taking Sienna
which is just like that bird sort of
coppery color and just working that in
true with the lower lash line
that I'm taking the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in black and using that
to line her waterline
and then I'm just taking a sort of
narrow II brush just with a bit of black
eyeshadow and just using that to smoke
it out just so it looks less sort of
harsh and it looks more smoky on your
lower lashline
I'm taking the new Anastasia Beverly
Hills bronzer in the shade I'm pretty
sure this is in mahogany
if not I'll leave the name down below
I'm just using that to bronze up her
cheeks I'm really liking this bronzer
lately I'm using rosewood
the color on myself and I know it's just
like my go-to blonde joke I really
really like how it looks on the skin so
yeah I'm popping that on her cheeks just
with a angled sort of brush
I'm taking the Anastasia Beverly Hills
medium to dark contouring kit and just
taking that middle shade on the bottom
and just using that to further contour
her face
then I'm taking some more of the laura
mercier translucent powder and just
using that to bake underneath her
bronzer
then I'm taking the Mack Melba blush and
just popping that on her cheeks
then I'm taking the huda beauty
highlighting palette I can't remember
which one it was called but I'm pretty
sure it's the desert one if not I'll
leave a list down below and was taking
that bottom at left color and just
popping that on her cheekbones
but I'm just taking some mascara on a
disposable mascara one and just blending
in her real lashes with the fake ones
and also coding her lower lashes as well
I'm taking the Urban Decay 24-hour glide
on lip pencil in the shade 1993 it's
just a darker nude and just lining her
lips and then celebs I'm taking their
Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick
in the shade on and popping that on on
me it looks a lot darker but it just
looks like the perfect neutral nude on
her skin tone I love it
and then over the top I'm taking just
the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar lip gloss
and then finally just spraying her face
with the glam glow globe it's set to
setting spray one of my favorites every
time I spray this for my clients they're
like oh my god that smells amazing it's
literally the best setting spray ever
and that is the final look I hope you
