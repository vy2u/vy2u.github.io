taking the Anastasia brow palette and
I'm taking the shade darkest brown I
think or dark brown and because mom's
eyebrows are already cosmetically
tattooed and she does like them a little
bit darker so I did go in with the
powder just to fill in all the sparse
areas
that I'm taking a concealer brush with
some Maybelline fit me concealer in the
light and just using that to define her
upper and lower brows
and then I'm just blending in that
concealer just with a this is a really
small kabuki brush I get heaps is like
people asking me what brush this is but
I got it from eBay ages ago and it's
perfect for doing this step then Truett
set the eyelids I'm taking the Rimmel
stay matte translucent powder I did
actually apply some concealer to her
eyelids as well just to act as a primer
then taking the Too Faced chocolate gold
palette and I'm taking the matte
transition shade next to the black up
the top and just using that as a
transition and pretty much just working
that into the crease and pretty much the
whole lid as well
and as you can see I'm just grabbing
more and more product and slowly
building up the color just because it's
easier to grab less products then a
whole bunch of product because it's
harder to blend out so I'm just really
slowly grabbing more and more product
and then I go in with a darker shade and
work that in through the outer corners
of her eyes
then I'm taking a little bit of the
black and also working out into the
outer corners of her eyes
then I'm taking the Maybelline master
precise gel not gel it's like a felt tip
liner and I actually gave this to Mum I
found it in my little makeup collection
and I just thought it'd be super easy
because she wanted a really thin line
and the applicator is like super super
thin so I wanted to keep it nice and
thin just because she has a little bit
of like hooded eyelid so I didn't really
want too much liner on the top then
going in with the benefit they're real
mascara I just don't understand why
rawand and just coating her lashes so
then I'm applying some individual lashes
now I do tend to use individual lashes
on my more mature clients just because
one they're way lighter true they look
more natural and three they're
definitely more comfortable than wearing
strip lashes so I just popped maybe like
five or six on on the outer corners
mainly and then I just popped on a few
shorter lashes on her inner corners but
not as many as the outside then moving
on to base I'm taking the mecca cosmetic
car hydrating moisturizer I really
really like this one and just popping
that all over her face first before
primer
then I'm taking the Porefessional pearl
primer and just popping that all over
her face mainly focusing it on the
center of her face where she has the
most pause so I start off at the center
and then bring it on out to the
perimeters of her face then spraying her
face with a bit of mac fix+ and then for
foundation I went in with the NAS
natural radiant foundation my favorite
at the moment and this one's in the
shade pantego Nia I'm pretty sure that's
how you pronounce it but I'll leave
everything listed down below as always
and just blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender
then for concealer I'm taking my
favorite Maybelline fit me in the shade
light this one was almost out so I ended
up just giving it to Mum straight after
I used it but usually I deposit some on
the back of my hand or on my metal
palate and just place it on with a brush
then I'm just blending it all in with
the same damp Beauty Blender
then just so the concealed underneath
our eyes I'm just taking the laura
mercier translucent powder i don't bake
or anything I feel like baking doesn't
really do much for mature skin so I just
like to pack it on a brush then for the
lower lash line I'm just taking at the
same transition colors that we used on
the top and just popping them on the
bottom
then to highlight the inner corners of
the eyes I'm taking the astrologer Telex
eye cream is it eye cream no cream
eyeshadow then just placing that on the
inner corners of the eyes this one is
just the champagne one so it's not the
white one so it doesn't look too intense
and then I'm going over it with the
Urban Decay single eye shadow in the
shade is the bride then I'm just taking
some more mascara and just meshing her
real with her false lashes then if a
bronzer I'm taking the true face
sweetheart
bronzer and just placing that in her
cheekbones then going in with some ma
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just baking underneath that contour just
to define it a little bit more then
going in with the Mac blush I'm unsure
of the name but I'll ever listed down
below it's just a matte one and just
placing that on the apples of her cheeks
then for highlighter I'm taking my
favorite this is like an it's called
like enhancing lighting powder or
something it's might make a cosmetic
anyways I'll leave it listed down below
it's literally one of my favorite
holidays at the moment I love how
intense it is so placing that on her
cheekbones Cupid's bow and down the
bridge of her nose I was going to say
for a minute then taking the Gerard
cosmetics Bellaire lipliner this is more
of a muted pink it's really really
pretty and then over the top I'm taking
angel lipstick by Mac this is really
really popular with mature clients I
find and I'm just taking the Marc Jacobs
lip gloss in sugar sugar on top then
just wiping away the excess translucent
powder then to set I'm taking the glam
glow glow set up setting spray and that
is the final look done look how pretty
she looks just so nervous to film this
but I was like you are literally so
perfect for this video so I hope you
