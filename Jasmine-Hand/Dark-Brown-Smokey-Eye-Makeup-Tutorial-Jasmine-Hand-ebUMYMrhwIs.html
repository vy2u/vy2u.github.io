small stippling brush and placing that
all over her face then for foundation
I'm using Mac Studio Fix fluid in and
c37 and just placing that all over her
face and then blending it in with a
Beauty Blender so I quickly did want to
mention that she wanted a full coverage
makeup look even though she may not need
it I don't want comments saying oh my
god she doesn't need that much makeup
I'm a good you put too much makeup on
her blah blah blah blah blah it was her
birthday and she wanted to go out full
coverage full glam so that is what I
gave her so yeah I just thought I would
quickly mention that and before I get
comments
then for concealer I'm using the

and just placing that underneath her
eyes to conceal and highlight and then I
go ahead and place it on her forehead
down the bridge of her nose Cupid's bow
on her chin and then on the sides of her
mouth
then going in with the laura mercier
translucent powder I'm just using that
on that same a Beauty Blender and
packing that underneath her eyes true

fav setting powder which is the
Australis fresh and flawless in the
shade darkest Brown and just using that
to set the rest of her face
then for brows I'm taking the under
stars e Beverly Hills Pro brow palette
and I'm just using the shade soft brown
on my pony cosmetics eyebrow brush and
very lightly filling in her brows
