jumpsuit in general and they have so
many cute ones to choose from everything
I use on my face is also available from
princess Polly but unfortunately the
discount code doesn't apply to makeup or
beauty items so it's just clothes and
accessories I really love how this

but it's still not natural it's still
kind of like you're wearing makeup but
it's not like wow she's wearing a lot of
makeup so I hope you guys enjoyed
watching and if you do please don't
forget to give it a thumbs up for me and
yeah I'll just get straight on to the
get ready with me hey guys so I'm just
getting started with the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue gel primer
and just putting that all over my face
this primer is amazing for oily skin
then I'm just going in with the benefit
browsing I actually forgot to show it
but it's just a little brow palette and
I'm just using the shade 4 and filling
in my brows then just going in with a
light concealer just to define above and
below the brows as well
mr. Foundation I'm taking the Bekaa aqua
luminous foundation and just running it
on my face first and blending it all in
with a real techniques sponge then
taking the la girl Pro concealer in the
shade light and just placing that
underneath my eyes it's been a while
since I actually use this so it was like
runny so I had to shake it up before I
squirted some out but it actually worked
really well so just place that
underneath and then blending it all out
Thunder taking my mini Watts up
highlighter from benefit I couldn't find
my full-size but obviously on the
website they have the full side I'm just
placing a little bit on my chubby little
finger and just placing that on the
highest point of my cheekbones Cupid's
bow and the tip of my nose so I'm just
taking some of the la girl
translucent powder just to set
underneath my eyes and then also use
that to set the rest of my face as well
then just taking the benefit 3d brow
tones I'm just using that to set my
brows in place to bronze in contour I'm
using hoola by benefit this is literally
my favorite bronzer in the whole world
and the brush is amazing as well
so yeah I'm just placing that in the
hollows of my cheekbones around the
forehead area and then down the sides of
my nose and on my jaw as well then
taking the new benefit flash I'm pretty
sure this one's called California and
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
I love this blush it's so I don't know
it just looks so glowy and beautiful on
the skin and I love the color as well on
two eyes I'm taking the Becca neutrals
palette and I'm just taking this shade
right here in the middle as my
transition shade and just popping that
in the crease
then taking the slightly darker shade
next to it and just popping that on the
outer corners of my eyes and blending it
out then taking that shade again I'm
just going to use that in my lower
lashline to make it a little bit smoky
then taking the darkest Brown from the
palette and mainly focusing that also on
the outer corners of my eyes as well
then taking the jeffree star cosmetics
ice cold skin frost and using that to
highlight my inner corners and brow bone
and then I also just place it on the
first half of my eyelid as well
and then just quickly curling my lashes
before mascara and mascara I used was
the pony cosmetics White Knight mascara
the false lashes I'm just taking at
these natural lashes by Ardell and just
popping them on with some duo lash glue
then for some more highlighter because
you can't have enough I'm just taking
the ice cold again and just popping that
on my cheekbones Cupid's bow and then
down the bridge of my nose then to
finish off the look for lips I'm taking
a celebrity skin a by Jeffrey star again
and yes just putting that on my lips
