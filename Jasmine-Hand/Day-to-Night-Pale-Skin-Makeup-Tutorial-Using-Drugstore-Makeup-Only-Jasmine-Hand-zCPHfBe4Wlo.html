just going to get straight into it again
I'm just using the Garnier micellar
water just on a cotton pad just to
ensure the face is clean before priming
for primer I'm using the NYX pore filler
and I'm actually really enjoying this
product lately I just mainly place it on
the sides of her nose on peoples
forehead and on the chin because that's
where I find that the most like textured
areas of the face are and then for
foundation i'm using the l'oreal true
match in the shade golden ivory and i'm
just as you can see placement on her
face and blending it all in with my damn
Beauty Blender
you
you
you
then free concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me in the shade 15 fair I
didn't actually realize that this was
lighter than the light one that I
usually use but this one is amazing for
people with lighter skin tones I don't
know if they recently just like came out
with this shade but it's more of a pinky
err based rather than the light I don't
know if the light even is a yellowy base
but it's just perfect for my skin tone
anyways but if you are fair that I would
definitely suggest you get the 15 fair
light and then to set that area I'm
using the NYX finishing HD powder this
was the first time using it and it was
okay it didn't really have that much
coverage I don't know what this powder
is really useful I think it's just for
setting the face but yeah it did work
well it did set the under-eye area like
how I wanted it to I know this next
product isn't particularly drugstore but
I really wanted to try it out it's the
iconic London strobing stick and because
I was going for a really glowy luminous
base I didn't want to set the foundation
or anything like that so that's why I
decided to use a cream highlighter
although if you're not keen on buying
this particular highlighter the benefit
Watts up is also really really good and
it's probably easier to get because you
can only get this product online
then taking the new Maybelline master
contour palette I was so excited to try
this out but one of the pans was a fail
and I'll show you that later on so I'm
just using that bronzing slash
contouring shade just to bronze
slash contour her cheeks I'm not sure if
it's like the best contouring shade but
yeah I did bronze her cheeks with it and
this is the highlighter so I would not
recommend this for pale skin as you can
see in this light right now in this
angle it looks good and you'll see in a
minute when she goes straight on it
literally just looks like two Brown
lines ready she was like oh yeah that's
nice so I don't know why I did this but
I just decide to apply more and yeah as
you can see look how dark it is so I
just wiped it off and started over I
shadow I'm using the blushed nudes
palette also by Maybelline I'm not too
fast on this the pigmentation isn't the
best I like the colors there's not
enough matte crease shades like I don't
know anyways I'm taking that dusty rose
color and I'm placing that into her
crease I probably think that this
palette would be like most appropriate
for daytime not so much nighttime just
because the colors just are not
pigmented enough I'm taking the light
whiter shimmery shade and just placing
that on her lid and then I'm just
blending them together just with that
same crease brush the brows I use the
new browser AMA pomade crayon and I
actually really enjoyed this product I
personally wouldn't just go straight
from the crayon to the eyebrow because
it is quite thick so it won't give you
more of like a precise cleaner brow so I
just used it on my eyebrow brush and it
did work well the color that I used was
the lighter color I think it's taupe or
something I'll leave it in the
description box down below anyways but I
love the consistency of this it's not
too pigmented so it won't look like a
blocky brow so yeah I really really am
enjoying this product
then for blush I'm taking that same
palette and just using that blush out of
it again not that fast about it it
wasn't as pigmented as I thought and it
does look really glowy in the pan but it
didn't really come off that glowy so I
don't know if I would rate the palette
and then for mascara I'm just using
their new push-up mascara from
Maybelline to be honest I don't think
the actual formula of the mascara really
makes a difference it's just all about
the brush and I use the same spoolie
every time it's just a silicon-based one
that I got from ebay so it's not like I
can really review the mascara itself
without actually using the brush and
obviously I'm not going to use a brush
for hygiene reasons but I will let you
guys know how I feel about the mascara
if I end up using it myself and then for
the lips I'm using the NYX butter gloss
in the shade creme brulee it's to date
one of my favorite nude glosses ever if
you don't have it I suggest you jump on
the bandwagon because it's so good and
it's so cheap as well and then to set
our face I'm using the master fix by
Maybelline doesn't really smell nice but
it does the trick and so this is the
daytime look it completed super wearable
for just a day today to work to the
movies wherever it's super glowy natural
and I just think it looks flawless
so then to amp up the makeup look I'm
taking cocoa bear by makeup geek I know
this is a particularly drugstore but it
is quite cheap $6 us a pan and it's one
of my favorite shadows to date
especially for the crease area for when
I am creating a more smoky eye I just
love orange you tone throughout the
crease so I couldn't find a drugstore
shade similar to this one so I just
decided to use this one and then I'm
going in with the blush nudes palette
again and I'm taking that matte brown
color which is on the bottom Road the
second one and I'm just packing that all
over her lid as you can see the shadows
aren't really that pigmented so that's
why I wouldn't really recommend this
palette if you're wanting to achieve
like a stark smokey eyed look just
because yeah the shades are really light
most of the shades are really light and
more daytime appropriate
you
then also taking that same matte brown
eyeshadow I'm just using that to smoke
out the lower lash line
then I'm just lining her waterline with
the Maybelline eye studio gel liner in
black and oh my god I didn't realize I
must have accidentally like dipped my
brush into the eye liner so I did a
little bit of a boo-boo but it can be
really easily fixed you just have to
wait for it to dry so I'm just
intensifying her contour a bit more I'm
just using the same Maybelline master
contour kit and just yeah intensifying
it a little bit so if you make a mistake
like this even if it's with mascara
eyeliner the trick is to wait for it to
dry before you wipe it off because then
it just flakes off really easily and
then for lashes I'm using the model
rach23 6 sorry it says sold out over the
image but it is sold out online
unfortunately but they said that they're
getting some more stock at the end of
the month if you guys are wondering
then I'm just going over the false
lashes and the real lashes just to blend
them together then for lips I'm going in
with a new Maybelline vivid matte liquid
lipstick this is in the shade rebel red
and I am so impressed with these liquid
lipsticks they're so pigmented easy to
apply not streaky at all and they just
look stunning on the lips they don't
really dry to like a very matte finish
which is what I personally would prefer
so it doesn't look flaky or like that
your lips look cracked or anything it
actually looks really nice on the lips
and they are quite comfortable as well
so yeah I really do like these then
again spraying with the smelly master
picks by Maybelline and this is the
night look done I hope you guys enjoyed
this little day tonight look tutorial
