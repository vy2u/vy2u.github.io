so in today's video I'm doing a first
impression that / review / demo on the
designer brands Pro contour kit don't
mind my face at the moment I know I've
got my eye makeup done so I just thought
I would do my face all on camera so I'm
gonna start off with primer and I'm
going to use the designer brands blur
primer and it is just a really really
thick primer that fills in your pores so
I'm just putting that all over my face
ok so now that my skin is all prepped
I'm gonna mix these two shades
it's the designer brands 24 hour
foundation in classic ivory and warm
honey I'm pretty sure this is the
darkest and this is a lighter so I'm
gonna have to mix and match because I'm
not fake tan but when I am fake tan the
darkest one matches me so yeah it's not
that dark but it's like perfect for a
fake tan so I'm gonna go mix and match
these ones and I'll be back in a second
let's hope this matches it should
and then I'm just going to use my damp
Beauty blender to blend that in this is
a perfect match yeah
I don't get people that do there I make
up before their face like wouldn't you
like get everything all smudged and like
ruined no I think it's sorting with that
some people do their eyes first like
when I'm watching some tutorials who
does that eyes first it's it crispy that
does her eyes bus or something and it
just like makes me cringe I'm like oh my
god how could you like do your eyes but
does anyone else think it's weird or is
that just me because I think that is so
weird
and then I'm just blending that all out
with my beauty blender
okay so now on to the contour palette so
first what I'm going to use is a mixture
of the banana shade and the lighter
shade to set my concealer underneath my
eyes and pack that underneath my eyes
wow this pad is actually really buttery
it's like this one popped on some red
lips it because I just thought my lips
just look so bad I just couldn't stand
staring at them any longer so I'm going
to grab this color which is a cooler
toned Brown to contour my face so I'm
just using a angled brush tapping off
the excess
not gonna lie I did not expect it to
look like this
Wow I really really like that color I'm
in love what the hell okay this is
amazing so I'm going to contour my nose
using the same shade it's the one on the
right on the bottom
it's gonna warm up the warhead area and
temple area and then of course along my
jaw line because who wants a fat y'all
not me
okay well I'm like really digging this
contour color what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna grab the white shade just on an
angled brush and I'm just going to
lightly bake with this not so much baked
but just crisp up the bottom just
because I don't feel like it needs
baking I really hope that this is coming
up on camera like it is in real life
because it's seriously like amazing I
I'm like speechless what the hell I
really do not expect it to look like
this I am so so happy with these contour
and highlight colors I'm so glad I found
this palette because now I can start
using in all of my drugstore tutorials
because it is only at $17.99 I'm pretty
sure you can't get designer brands from
Priceline but I know you can get it
online or in chemists and pharmacies and
I did see a little stand in price attack
so they are the three places that I know
100% they have so yeah thank you guys so
