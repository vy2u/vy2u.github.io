so I'm just going to get straight into
it I'm going in with you Garnier
micellar water just all over the face to
ensure it's all nice and clean before
priming and for primer I use the Too
Faced hangover primer and just put it
all over her face for brows I'm taking
the UH nastasi Beverly Hills Pro brow
palette I'm taking these shades in soft
brown and just using that to fill in her
brows
then I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and just
using that to define the brows
then just taking the benefit gimme brow
in the shade blonde and just running
that through our brows to set them in
place then spraying her face with the
mac fix+ prep and prime spray and then
for foundation I'm going in with the
Tarte Amazonian clay and mixing it with
the iconic London liquid highlighter the
color of the foundation I used was tan
sand so I'm just dotting that all over
her face and then blending it all in
with a damp Beauty Blender
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and using
that underneath her eyes true conceal
and highlight then I go ahead to putting
it on a chin Cupid's bow down the bridge
of her nose on her forehead and then a
little bit around her nose as well
then taking the iconic London that
liquid illuminator again and I'm just
popping that on the high point of her
cheekbones just because I wanted a
really Juhi base because I haven't
really done a Jew eBay sort of type
tutorial on my channel yet so yeah I'm
just placing that on the highest point
of her cheekbones and then I go ahead to
place it on her Cupid's bow on the tip
of our nose a little bit on her chin and
then above and B below her eyebrows
then taking the under stars II Beverly
Hills contouring kit I'm taking the
banana shade I'm using that underneath
her eyes to set the concealer
then using the hooter Beauty rose gold
palette I'm taking the shade sandalwood
which is a perfect transition color and
using that in her crease
then taking the shade henna and using
that also in her crease just to deepen
it up a little bit
then I'm taking the shade cocoa and
really focusing that on the outer
corners of the eyes
you
then taking the rose gold foiled
eyeshadow not going to lie it didn't
really come out as nicely pigmented on
the brush so I had to use my finger and
so awkward because I have really long
nails so yeah I'm just mainly just
patting it on with my finger and then I
go in with a brush to even it out a
little bit then I'm taking moon dust out
of the palette and placing that on her
inner corners
then I'm taking a black truffle which is
just a matte black eyeshadow and also
using that on the outer corners to
deepen it up a little bit
then for lino I'm taking the UH Nastasia
Beverly hillz waterproof cream color in
the shade jet which is just a black and
just using that to line the top of her
eyes then I'm just taking some
translucent powder on an angled wedge
and just using that to kind of make the
eye shadow a little bit more crisp and
then I'm taking the benefit they're real
mascara on a disposable mascara wand and
coating her lashes before falsies
then I'm just popping on some model rock
lashes and not usually a style that I
would typically use on clients but I
think it really really complimented her
eyeshadow I can't remember what the
style number was but I'll definitely
find out and leave it listed down below
for you guys so I'm just applying them
straight on top then taking the mac
mineralize skinfinish in the shade
medium tan and just using that to set
the rest of her foundation then to
bronze I'm taking the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer and using that to
bronze up her face I really wanted to do
a Joey bronzy look so I added quite a
bit and I really loved how it turned out
so yeah I'm just using an angled brush
by spectrum and just applying that in
the hollows of her cheekbones and around
her jaw then I take the UH Nastasia
contour kit and just mixing those two
bottom shades to lightly contour as well
then taking the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to bake underneath where we just bronzed
just on the same Beauty Blender as
before
for blush I'm taking the Milani baked
blush in Luminoso and just place that on
her cheeks then I'm taking the Becca
shimmering skin perfector in a champagne
pop and placing that in the same places
we place the liquid illuminator so on
the highest point of her cheekbones
above her brows Cupid's bow and tip of
her nose and then finishing off the eyes
and taking a henna and scanner wood and
running that underneath her lower lash
line
and then to darken it up I'm taking
cocoa and black truffle and just really
pressing that into her lower lashline
and then blending it out with a fluffier
brush
then to lino lips I'm taking the dried
cosmetics share lip liner and obviously
lining her lips
then for lipstick I'm taking the
Smashbox cosmetics be legendary lipstick
in the shade
and using that to fill it in I'm
obsessed with this nude color and the
formula of these are amazing they're a
matte finish but they're not too drying
so yeah I'm loving these at the moment
so just placing that all over her lips
then on top of just taking this mac
lipglass it's actually a plush glass
whatever that means and just popping
that on top and then to finish a look
and set the face I'm just taking the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and that is the look done I hope you
guys enjoyed watching I think she looks
absolutely stunning as always

my model on my channel and let me know
