so in today's video I created this
double winged liner look and it's
actually a collab with the amazing
Alondra desi from YouTube absolutely
love her look she looks so flawless and
it just looks amazing so you should
definitely go and check out her video
I'll leave everything down below if you
would like to see how I created this
double winged liner look then please
keep watching so I'm going to be using
the Anastasia shadow Pro - ah well
travel appellate it's new and it is
amazing and firstly going to pick up the
color soft peach and just put that all
over my lid to set my concealer so I'm
going to do that now and then I'm
grabbing Morocco which is a really
gorgeous like burnt brown color and just
buffing that into my crease and also
onto the whole lid just make sure you
don't go above the crease and then I'm
going to grab hot fudge which is a dark
brown shade and just using the same
brush I'm just deepening the out of the
and I'm just using a really large
blending I'm brush to do this because I
want it to be seamless and then I'm
going to grab a little bit of new or I
never know how to pronounce that but I
literally just dabbed it in once and
also just buffing that into the outer
corner so now I'm just going to take
pink champagne which is a shimmery
amazing color and just pop that into my
inner corners and then I'm also just
going to take a bit of soft gold as well
and that shadow is also from Anastasia
Beverly Hills just as an inner corner
highlight so for winged liner I'm going
to use the Maybelline hyper sharp wing
it's called its new and you can get it
from Priceline so I'm just going to
create a wing hopefully this is going to
work
I'm not bringing the wing in all the way
to the start of my eyes because I want
to make my eyes look as big as possible
so now for the bottom eyeliner so what I
am using is the Anastasio waterproof
cream color in sable which is just a
dark brown and I'm just using that on a
makeup addictions angled liner brush so
literally all you're doing is creating
another wing directly underneath the top
wing they have to make sure that there
is a gap in between both wings
otherwise it won't look like a double
wing what I'm going to do first is line
my waterline just with the same color
just like that it's just really rough it
doesn't have to be neat and then I'm
just going to put a little bit of this
underneath because we're going to use
that product to smudge it out and make
it look really smoky and then for the
line I really hope you can see this
because I've never done this angle
before but what you want to do is
literally
you
just draw a line so now we're going to
do an upside down when you're literally
just trying to mimic that top line on
the bottom so just imagine yep so what
we're going to do see how I've liked it
kind of looks like a wing this is so
hard to explain so it should look
something like that and now I'm just
going to grab this makeup addictions
small pencil brush and I'm going to use
the shade fudge out of the palette and
blend the waterproof cream color into my
bottom lash line and now I'm just going
to use a bit of Morocco as well to
diffuse any harsh lines I'm just going
to grab this zoeva winged liner brush
and I'm going to take the soft gold
again and just fill in that gap
like saw so now I'm just going to apply
it some mascara on the top and bottoms
I'm just using the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara the new one and the
lashes that I'm using is the House of
lashes iconic and they look like this
that it's in a different package because
I don't know where the package is
actually and I'm just using the House of
lashes lash glue as well which is my
all-time favorite cup so I'm just going
to wait 30 seconds for the glue to dry
I'm just kind of molding them into the
shape of my eye because they're really
I'm not flexing like the band's really
thick so sometimes it's really hard to
apply but I'm going to give it a go
alright so I usually just put it on with
my fingers then I get some tweezers
 see what I mean
- lipstick that I will be using is the
drug cosmetics Rodeo Drive it's one of
their newest shades and lip line I'm
going to use the essence cosmetics satin
move lip liner
you
and this is the finished look I really
really enjoyed filming this video I
didn't think it would turn out like it
did because I'm not usually a fan of
double wings probably because I can't do
them for so but I really liked how
it turned out usually when I do them I
just end up looking like a drag queen
but I hope you guys enjoyed it and learn
some tips don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you did enjoy it
and I will see you in my next video
bye guys another brow yeah picture okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
