I'm here in Brussels in Belgium I'm I
thought I would set my vlog here instead
of like at the airport because I don't
know about you but I look like a hot
mess at airports and the last thing I
want to do is to be like vlogging my
hotness of a face and I was just so
tired and hungry I just thought I would
start my vlog here so I'm here in my
hotel in Brussels my friends think that
I'm doing this euro trip with is coming
to meet me tomorrow so she's in London
at the moment with her family and yet
Tomorrowland tomorrow so she is coming
here I think around 9:00 a.m. so because
it's like 10 o'clock now I thought I
needed to do something otherwise I'm
just going to crash and sleep I'm not
tired but I feel like I could sleep I
did actually take some sleeping tablets
in the plane at the first time I've ever
taken sleeping tablets and highly
recommend they literally knocked me out
like so good so I think I'm going to do
one of those bus to it and now I asked
the cab driver on the way here like what
to do he's like your best off just to do
like one of those bus tours because it
goes literally everywhere every much all
I've done since being here is come up to
my room how to shower and then went down
and had some breakfast and then it
popped on some makeup and now I'm here
so I thought I would show you guys what
my room looks like it's not the best but
it's like it's a room like you literally
commute asleep as you walk in the
bathroom I have all of my
everywhere how cool is this mirror love
how they have these like lights so it's
really really good for makeup hi hair
dryer and staff all of my makeup brushes
and eye makeup and then there's a little
mirror here so I'm just wearing these
jeans from Babyboo fashion and then just
my editors crop top I'll probably bring
like a little bomber jacket as well and
then the bed painting windows TV desk
cute chair so yeah that's pretty much it
I should probably close it all alright
so I should probably go and face to my
mom because she's been like messaging me
non-stop she's so cute she was it I like
where I am 24/7 I'm like mom if you
don't hear from me just check my
snapchat because literally I snapped up
everything so yeah I'm going to go
and relax now just go through my phone
and social media because I haven't had
it for ages I'll take you along with me
to the bus tour I don't know if I'm
gonna do like a walking tour or a bus
tour yet not sure but yeah but we just
go and explore and like wander around
first and then go underwear to us so
yeah I will see you guys very soon
currently waiting for an uber to come
and get me I'm going to Grand Place
which is pretty much like central of
Brussels it's going to go walk around
and explore so we're being in a city
that you don't know anything about
everywhere so pre already and I'm
literally just outside myself I know how
long I'm going to do public flogging but
I'll see how I go these buildings are
amazing I'm in the Grand Place in the
middle so do so many people around but
Yolo okay I'm going to go take some
photos now we're going to have to ask
