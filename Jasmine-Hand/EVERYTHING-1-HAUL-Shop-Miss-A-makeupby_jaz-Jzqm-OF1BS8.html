channel I know you're probably thinking
wow this bitch has really really dark
eyebrows I just actually got them
cosmetically tattooed yesterday so they
are supposed to go darker and then
they'll kind of scrape off I know that
sounds disgusting but yeah they'll
scrape off and then hopefully fade into
the color of my hair or sort of close to
that but I really wanted to film this
haul today because I just received this
package from shop miss kake.com if you
don't know what shop me say is it's
pretty much a website with clothes
jewelry makeup anything lingerie
all $4 like every single thing on the
website is a dollar and the shipping is
$10 worldwide I'm pretty sure so once
you convert the dollar I think it's like
a dollar 70 Australian yeah I'm just
gonna get straight into it so I'm gonna
start with jewelry and accessories I
picked up three pairs of earrings and
true bracelets so the first part
variance is the ones I'm actually
wearing today they are absolutely
amazing they are black and gold with a
lace sort of design and I think that
would look absolutely amazing with
anything I think these earrings would
definitely dress up an outfit so the
next areas I got a also black and gold
and they seriously speak themselves
these the quality of these earrings are
so amazing for a dollar like I can't
even deal these ones are incredible so
the next pair I got are also black and
gold and they're just a teardrop to sort
of design really really simple and once
again can dress up any makeup look or
outfit and the final therapy
I got these ones they are silver and
gold and white and seriously they are
amazing the bottom of the earrings at a
tea shop to have green reflect and holy
hell in the Sun these look amazing so I
can't wait to wear these ones so in the
next two items I got featuring the hamsa
symbol so the first one I got is a gold
chain with turquoise rocks with a gold
hamsa and a dark blue eye and the next
one I got is a silver chain with a light
blue ribbon sort of plaited into it and
it has a silver hamsa with dye Monte's
and a dark blue eye as well I'm actually
obsessed with the hamsa hand symbol I
really really want to touch her like
behind my ear or something so yeah
that's why I pick things up so the next
few things that I got up pretty random
but really cool first thing I got were
some felt blending edges these are the
type of sponges that I used to bake my
contour so I just place my face in
Australia translucent powder underneath
here and it works perfectly nice needed
some more because the ones that I have
were getting pretty old so the next
thing I got was also pretty random it's
a little sticky thing that you place on
the dashboard of your car so you can
stick your phone on there not quite sure
how this is gonna work because it's not
as sticky as I thought it would be and
I'm just wondering if the stickiness
will actually go away like after a while
like how many times will I come and
stick on this before it doesn't get kind
of sticky anyway oh yes I'm gonna try
that random little touch it out the next
thing is also random but really cool in
my opinion it is actually a nail art
paint brush now it is so super fine and
I think it would be amazing for winged
liner so that's why I picked it up I'll
let you know what I think of it I
probably doing
- grandpa's about how I like the lashes
and everything else so yeah keep it up
for that so next I got the elf
shimmering facial whip it's in a rose
sort of color and wow the first time I
put this on my hand as you can see right
there it is amazing I can't wait to use
this on my cheekbones I don't really
have any rosy pink highlighters so
that's why I picked it up so the rest of
my wall is lashes I picked up about six
or seven different styles in lots of
five so I'm gonna get straight into that
the lashes are Cara eyelashes there are
a hundred percent human hair and they
are so similar to my red cherry lashes
I've got some red cherry lashes here
that I'll put up against these ones so
the first day I got was in the style
five to three and they're just so
amazing they're so similar to the ones
that I use on my clients now which are
the model drop lashes in two one two
these ones are about three dollars a
pair where thousands or Abdulla so
obviously you're going to want to get
these ones these are pretty much
identical however these ones have more
of a gap in between each eyelash then
these ones but still they look amazing a
lash band is invisible which is what I
love because I don't like to see thick
lash bands
I prefer invisible lash band just
because they're so much easier to apply
and just look way more natural the next
day I got this 7 4 7 m and these are
literally the exact same ones as my red
cherry 7 for 7 mm they even have the
same name like boo but yeah they're
exactly the same
I can't fault these car ones so far they
look amazing I so cannot wait to try
this on my clients this weekend so yes
so the next ones I got were in the style
D W they look like this they're much
shorter in comparison to the other size
that I got I don't mean in length I mean
in the actual lycra with of the eyelash
and I think these are amazing for people
with smaller eyes so I have to chop any
of it off but yeah that's why I got
these ones and so far I'm loving it
Paragon are in the style of WSP I'm just
imagining these on and I would think
they looked so natural so that's why I
picked them up and yeah these ones love
them then expert lashes are the for15
I'm actually wearing them on my eyes
today and I love them we're so really
really similar to the red cherry
14:8 lashes which I don't have here at
the moment but they are literally
identical if you know what the red
cherry lashes look like just seriously
blown away with the quality of these
lashes I really didn't think that they
would pull through and look amazing as
they look so I'm so super excited though
the next pair I got was the full on true
lashes and these definitely remind me of
the socializer playing coy lashes but
like on steroids there's a bit of a gap
between each eyelash really really
flirty and flurry I love them and I
can't wait to use them and then next I
picked up some individual lashes now
these ones are also for my more mature
clients that don't want strip lashes so
I decided to pick up these ones they are
in the lengths short medium and long so
the short one is obviously for clients
that
that little bit of extra flair
especially on the outer corners of the
eyes so I could just put a few of those
strands on or if I have a client that
wants dramatic lashes I can add some of
these longer ones to the outer section
who knows but these look incredible and
I can't wait to use these lines so that
concludes my haul don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed
this haul and if you would like me to do
more of these kinds of videos thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
