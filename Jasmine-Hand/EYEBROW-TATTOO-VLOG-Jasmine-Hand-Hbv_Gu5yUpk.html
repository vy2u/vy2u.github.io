vlog I'm off to a really exciting
appointment today I'm actually getting
my eyebrows reassured so if you guys
have followed me for a while you would
know I went through Sabina around two
and a half years ago so it's been two
years since my last touch-up and I have
absolutely nothing in my brows at the
moment I got them freshly threaded
yesterday so there's no product in them
you can kind of still see the tattoo
strokes from like two years ago but I
just feel like the ends and all my
arches have kind of faded and I just
want them just looking a little bit more
bolder and a little bit thicker here I
think so yeah that's what I'm doing
today I'll bring the vlog camera along
so I can vlog I'm not sure how much I'll
vlog of the actual appointment but I
will be sure to vlog as much as I can
but yeah I just thought you guys
thinking of getting brown shadows this
would be a I don't know informative
video for you guys to watch I would a
hundred percent recommend them they've
literally changed my life and my makeup
game like I literally hardly touch my
brows anymore and I haven't since I got
them done like when I put a full face of
makeup on I do like really lightly fill
them in but I don't have to do much
because like the shapes already there
and I just have to go over the like
shape that she made for me so yeah I
will see you guys when I'm in the clinic
when ago this was made two years ago yes
how good is she
so I've just finished my eyebrow
tattooing and I've put a really thin
layer of the bepanthen that she gave me
for aftercare so apparently I have to
wear that for a week and keep them out
of water for a week as well and they'll
start scabbing and it's like really
gross but that's just part of the
healing process and then they should get
lighter so tomorrow they're gonna be way
darker but I'll update you guys on
everything but I am so happy with him
she's literally eyebrow clean like I'm
obsessed so yeah I will check in with
you guys tomorrow hey guys so it's now
day at to post brow tutors I have no
makeup on well so this is what my brows
are looking like now definitely a lot
darker but that is normal I just put a
really light layer of the pant them on
and I'm supposed to do that once a day I
think until they start scabbing but yes
so far so good I just look a little bit
weird with bold brows and no makeup but
that's alright so I will check in with
you guys if they're the same tomorrow I
probably won't blog tomorrow but when
they start scabbing I'll definitely keep
you guys updated with that and what that
looks like as well so I will see you
guys when I see you guys next hey guys
so it is now don't worry about my shiny
head it is now Monday so it has been
five days since my brows why don't we
just focus it I got them wet for the
first time today I'm underneath the
shower I'm still putting a light layer
of pants them on because you said a week
they're starting to scab here you can
kind of see but apparently you're not
supposed to like pick the scabs because
it kind of like is bad for the healing
process so I'm just kind of leaving them
as they are to scab but so far so good
but yeah so far so good so if you guys
have any questions regarding the brows
leave a list it down below and I'll be
sure to answer them for you guys I don't
really know if I'm going to do any more
updates so I might end this vlog here
but I'm sure you'll see
Hix the photos on my Instagram but I
could not recommend Sabina enough she's
amazing she's like to go to brow
tattooist here on the Gold Coast like
people travel from like Sydney Melbourne
everywhere in Australia to see her
because she's that good
so I'll make sure to leave all over
social media and a website listed down
below for you guys thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
