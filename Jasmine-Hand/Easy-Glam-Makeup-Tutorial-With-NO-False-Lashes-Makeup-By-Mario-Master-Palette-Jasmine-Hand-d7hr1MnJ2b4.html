so I'm going to get straight into it so
I'm going in with just the Garnier
micellar water just on a cotton pad just
to ensure the face is nice and clean
before priming
then I'm going in with the benefit
Porefessional Matt rescue primer and
just applying that all over a face with
a small stippling brush
then using the Mac prep and prime
effects + spray and just spraying a
generous amount all over a face before
foundation the foundation I'm going in
with is the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
flawless foundation sticks this one's in
the shade natural and first I'm just
applying it all over a face not going to
lie it was really tough to blend out
compared to other foundation sticks that
I own they weren't as creamy as I
thought they would be but I found that
once I sprayed her face with a bit of
the urban decay spray or even if you
just use a mac fix+ or any spray or even
like an oil or something it definitely
blended a lot better but I can say that
this finish of the foundation is
literally flawless it just did take a
little bit of time to blend into the
skin
then taking the la girl pro conceal in
the orange color just to use underneath
her eyes to counteract the purpley tone
so I only use a really little bit of
this and just blend it all out then
going in with a Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 10 I'm just using
that too of course concealed underneath
her eyes so as you can see I'm just
placing that underneath her eyes and
then I go ahead to blend it all in with
a damp Beauty Blender
then I just got to play some of that
same maybelline fitme concealer on her
eyelids to act as a primer then taking
at the Laura Mercier translucent powder
on that same damp Beauty Blender I'm
just really packing the product
underneath her eyes to avoid the
concealer from creasing then the brows
I'm taking the Ardell brow defining kit
and just using the darker color from the
palette to fill in her eyebrows
then to set the rest of our face I'm
taking the Australis fresh and flawless
face powder in the shade darkest brown
and just dabbing that all over her face
then I'm just sweeping away the excess
powder from the bacon underneath eyes I
don't know why call it bacon oh good
then to make the brows a little bit more
defined I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer again just on a concealer
brush and just running that just
directly underneath and above the brows
and I'm just using a clear brow gel to
set the brows in place then taking the
Too Faced Sweethearts bronzer and just
using that on an angled brush by
spectrum cosmetics and just using that
to warm up the face
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder again just on the
same damp be blender I'm just creating a
line from the top of her ear to the side
of her mouth just to make the contour a
little bit more defined
then going in with the NARS dual
intensity blush in the shade sexual
content and using that true put on her
cheeks and not to say just then but yeah
applying that to her cheeks and then for
highlighter I'm taking the artist
Couture Coco bling loose diamond glow
powder I'm not sure how I feel about
loose powder highlighters it looked
really intense and amazing but I feel
like if I just blew on her cheek like it
would just come off maybe next time I'll
wet the brush and then apply it but yeah
it's such an amazing and like intense
highlight then I'm just wiping off the
excess powder from the bank then taking
one of my favorite palettes at the
moment the master palette by Mario in
collaboration with Anastasia Beverly
Hills I'm taking the shade Isabelle
first as a transition shade such a
gorgeous palette oh my god I swear these
eyeshadows are like 10 times better than
her original ones and I thought her
original ones were good like they're so
creamy so buttery so easy to blends such
an amazing palette if you don't have it
then literally go get it so good so yeah
I'm just using a really large fluffy
brush to blend this into the crease
then I'm taking Violetta and I'm pretty
much just placing this all over the lid
so really wanted like a one color soft
brown smokey eye and I decided not to
wear falsies because I've had heaps of
requests from you guys to do like a glam
makeup look without falsies just because
some of you guys I don't know don't know
how to apply them or would just prefer a
look without them I love this look and
how it turned out without falsies I
personally probably like would wear
falsies with like a look like this but I
think Maddie literally suited it so much
so yeah I'm just pretty much blowing
that out into a crease so I'm just
placing the brown on the lid and then
just smoking it out and blending it in
with the transition color then I'm
taking violet again and I'm using that
to smoke out her lower lashline area
once again I didn't want to make it too
dramatic and put like black or a brown
in her waterline I decided to keep it
blank and just use eyeshadow to create
that definition
then taking this color out of the modern
renaissance palette by Anastasia as well
and just using that as an inner corner
and brow bone highlight then taking the
black out of the shadow Couture palette
also by Anastasi eye and I'm just using
that to line the top lash line just
because yeah I didn't want to put any
like liquid liner or anything harsh like
that so I just used it to make it a
little bit smoky for mascara and then
the mascara I used was the pony
cosmetics white night but first I curled
her lashes then went ahead and used a
disposable mascara wand to apply the
mascara on the top and bottom lashes
so for the first clip option I went with
the NARS Velvet lip cream this one is in
the shade strip which is an amazing nude
color oh my god the formula of these are
so incredible so I'm just placing that
all over her lips then just adding some
more highlight and I actually really
love this clip I think the makeup looks
so good
then the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray to set the face in place I'm so
tired
then I want to see what the look would
look like with a more pinky lip so this
is just a Mac palette I'm pretty sure
the shade was like loved lawn or
something like that I'll leave
everything listed down below anyways
I'll have to look it up and let you guys
know what palette it is but yet I really
did like the pink I personally probably
would go a nude but for those of you
that are more pinky girls I just thought
I would show you guys what it looked
like and I really liked it on her
so last lip color I decide to match it
to the eyes so I did Jerrod Cosmetics
nude lip liner and then for the lipstick
I used a velvet teddy by Mac and this is
the final look with the velvet teddy
lipstick on I hope you guys enjoyed
