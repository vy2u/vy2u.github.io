the airport as you guys probably already
know I'm going to Europe for 25 days on
a Kentucky tour with my bestie so yeah

do some Gd free shopping so yeah I'm
just gonna take you around with me I

hello everyone we made it to Singapore
Airport and it's 5 a.m. and tireless
 so I'll probably have a nap before
our next flight to London which is what
time 12 o'clock
so in 5 hours so yeah I'm gonna go to
bed
so I ended up getting the Mac warm
neutrals palette and I only paid like
130 dollars for it so that's the biggest
deal ever and then I got the makeup
forever pro finish in I think the darker
shade which is very dark so I'm so
excited to try that we're boarding in
like 2 hours so yeah
so we've just stopped over at a service
station on our way to power rule and
it's pretty cold but I can't be
putting this jacket on because it's so
heavy
but um yeah I can't wait to go to Paris
we're going to the Eiffel Tower
octa trompe champs elysées or else not
sure damn all that night so it's going
to be so pretty to have a look so yeah I
guess I'm gonna vlog there and this is
when our bus looks like it's kontiki I
think that other tours see some other
people following us okay we're heading
back on the bus now so ttyl so we just
checked into our hotel in Paris that is
the bathroom the mirror hey Alex
a little window TV it's actually pretty
cute compared to what we stayed in last
night so we're going to have a shower
and get ready to go to the Eiffel Tower
which should be amazing at night because
I've never seen the Eiffel Tower at
night have you Alex yeah well you
then and I guess I'll see you then
hey guys so we are currently on the
carousel or ferry in Paris it is amazing
my makeup is so hopefully that the motor
would have had it on smooth throughout
the seven our feet are killing us
absolute death but it's all worth it I
guess in the end but yeah hope you guys
are enjoying following me around
Alex the Eiffel Tower has jumped ELISA
it opens its root and then
the lube is up there which is where we
just went to it's amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
