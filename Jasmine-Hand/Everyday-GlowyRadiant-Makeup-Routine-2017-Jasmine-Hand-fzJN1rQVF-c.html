so in today's video I will be doing this
glowy
sort of radiant everyday makeup look and
in today's video I have also
collaborated with Rimmel London
Australia so thank you so much for
sponsoring this video I've tried out
then you wake me up anti fatigue
Foundation and also their concealer and
their insta-fix and go setting spray I'm
honestly so happy with how this book
turned out it's super super easy to
achieve so if you would like to see how
I created this look I also added a
little bit of freckles at the end
because I wanted to experiment so if you
want to see how I got this look then
just keep on watching so first up I'm
going in with primer obviously this is
just a pore filling primer and just
putting that evenly all over my face I'm
just going in with the dipbrow and
filling my brows I'm sure you've seen me
do this plenty of time so I won't go
into much detail but yeah basically I
just start on the tail and then work my
way up to the side of the brows and just
kind of give them a gradient type look
then just using the Rimmel wake me up
concealer this one's in the shade ivory
and just using that to sculpt out the
brows I always do this to my brows just
because I feel like it gives it more of
a defined look so I just grab it on a
concealer brush and just run it above
and below the brows
now I'm going in with the Rimmel London
in Sussex and go setting spray which
actually acts as a primer and a setting
spray and one to obviously help your
makeup last longer throughout the day so
you can actually spray it on before
foundation and after then going in with
you wake me up foundation Ollie the
colors that I use listed down below the
one on the right is actually their new
formula as opposed the one on the left
which is their old formula so the new
formula 1 has the anti fatigue and
vitamin C in it so make sure you look
for the bottle on the right so I'm just
doing that all over my face first and
then I just go in with a Beauty Blender
so basically this foundation aims to
reawaken
dull skin which is amazing they have a
new formula enriched with vitamin C to
brighten the skin the formula actually
has radiance pearls that helps eliminate
a signs of tightness which is perfect
for those days where you've either had a
big night or you just wake up feeling
dull and I definitely would have to
agree with that because it did really
make my face feel really radiant and
glowy but still had that coverage that
everyone needs and wants I just realize
I said Beauty Blender before when I
meant makeup brush sorry guys but what
I'm doing now is I'm just pressing that
into my skin just so it's really
absorbed into my skin and not sitting on
top because there's nothing worse than
having cakey foundation so yeah I'm just
really pressing that into the skin then
going in with the wake now anti fatigue
concealer I used to shade ivory which I
believe is the lightest shade this
formula is also enriched with vitamin C
and it brightens the under eyes
amazingly I have never found a concealer
that has the coverage and actually
brightens up the under eye area as well
as this concealer I've been using this
for a couple of days now just in my
everyday makeup routine and I've got to
say I'm absolutely loving it I don't
like using full coverage concealers
underneath my eyes unlike a DC base it's
just I feel like it feels heavy but with
this concealer it still has the car
bridge to cover like under-eye circles
or if you're tired but it also
illuminates as well which is amazing so
yeah I'm just blending that out with my
damp Beauty Blender this time this time
I'm using a Beauty Blender and then onto
the rest of the face I'm going to do a
little bit of cream contouring i'm just
using the hoola one which is relatively
new and just popping out on the places
where i would typically contour so in
the hollows of my cheeks around my jaw a
little bit on my forehead down the sides
of my nose
unbeliev my lip and then I go ahead and
blend it out I don't bake unthink my
eyes on an everyday basis so usually
what I do is I just get some translucent
powder on a brush and just really press
that into the under eye area and it
seems to set it well throughout the day
and doesn't crease and then I'm just
setting my eyelids as well just in
preparation for a little bit of eye
shadow then taking the benefit what's up
highlighter and just using that on my
finger just applying that on to the
highest point of my cheekbones Cupid's
bow down the bridge of my nose and a
little bit on my tip and then I think
I've put some underneath my brows as
well
and just to intensify the contour I'm
just going in with the powder Hall art
and just going over my cheekbone area
then going in with the hooter beauty 3d
highlighter palette and just going in
with that first shade and just applying
that directly over the top of the other
highlighter just to intensify it a bit
more because let's be real who doesn't
want a blinding highlight every day then
going in with the Rimmel stay matte
translucent powder and just using that
on a brush and just running that just
directly underneath the contour just to
define it a little bit more then taking
this violet Voss Pro eyeshadow palette
taking that warm toned Brown and just
using that in the crease as a transition
shade then taking the benefit what's up
highlighter again and just putting that
all over the lid and blending it out
with my finger
then taking the hooter Beauty palette
again just taking at that shade and just
popping that straight over top then
taking this warmer toned brown shade and
just also popping that into the crease
just to give it a little bit more
definition and also placing that
underneath my eyes just to smoke out the
lower lash line a bit
then taking at that same highlight up
from the hooter palette and just putting
that in my inner corners then taking the
Rimmel scandaleyes reloaded mascara and
just coating the top and bottom lashes
then I'm just taking a nude lipliner and
obviously lining my lips
then using the Rimmel Kate Moss lipstick
in the shade 42 one of my fave nudes and
popping that on my lips then over top
I'm going in with the Rimmel
on my gloss this one's actually clear
but because I always mix it it turns a
different color so I'm just putting that
on top and then to set the face i'm
using the insta-fix and go spray which
actually smells so amazing and is so
refreshing so for those wondering how I
got the little freckles all I used was
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills brow Wiz
I'm pretty sure this is just in the
shade like caramel or even medium brown
and yet all I'm just doing is like
swirling like little dots all over my
like cheek area and on my nose and
that's literally all I did oh and then I
did go in with a Marc Jacobs eye liner
as well just to make some of the
freckles a little bit darker
so that is the final looks done I hope
you guys enjoyed watching I loved
filming this I love love love how it
turned out so I hope you guys did as
well
