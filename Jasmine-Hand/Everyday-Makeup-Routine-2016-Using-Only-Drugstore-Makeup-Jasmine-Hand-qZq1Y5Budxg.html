channel so today's video is going to be
of this everyday makeup look because 99%
of the stuff that I use on a day-to-day
basis is from the drugstore I decided to
do a whole face of drugstore makeup so
yeah this is kind of like my go to the
shops movies out in the house if I want
to wear makeup makeup look all drugstore
so if you want to see how I created it
then keep on watching okay so from
camera I'm going to use the Australis
original primase to be obsessed with
this stuff ages ago comes out like
really gluggy it's really nice and
hydrating it smells really nice as well
so I'm gonna pop that all over by the
way my hair's wet but it's had a shower
it's not oily you know like that awkward
hair situation where it looks oily but
it's actually work yeah look my current
siege just an FYI I don't actually wear
makeup every day but when I do wear
makeup I don't wear a little bit of
makeup like I'm either no makeup or full
glam I can't just wear like a little bit
of BB cream and mascara cuz I just think
I look worse than if I'm just not
wearing makeup so I know this might not
be an everyday makeup look for most of
you out there but it's an everyday
makeup look for me so yeah that's why I
decided to film it so for foundation I'm
going to use the Maybelline fit me matte
phase it fit me yeah fit me matte and
poreless in the shade 220 because I'm a
bit tagged at the moment I've actually
really been loving this foundation ever
since I tried it again like lately I
know I just really like the color it
really matches my fake tan well and it
doesn't look too cakey like true full-on
so I'm just cutting that in so I decided
to go full drugstore for this look just
because I gathered that most of the
stuff that I use in a daily basis is
from the drugstore so just the stuff
that I don't use that strug so I'm just
going to use drugstore instead of it
I feel weird saying drugstore in
Australia but like I know everyone knows
where drugstore means the first I
actually went to America I saw drugstore
a second massive sign I was like well
what the and mums like no this is
so funny I was like 13 I'm sort of
confused yes that's the foundation on I
just did one even layer I guess with the
concealer are you going to use the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light I'm
just going to place that underneath
so I don't usually highlight the center
of my face just for like a quick
everyday look but I just did it today
because I remembered but when I'm like
in the biggest rush all I do is conceal
my under eye areas and then to set my
concealer I'm just going to use the face
of Australia translucent powder sorry if
this stuff isn't available in the US but
I'm sure you can just get it from eBay
or something and I'm just placing that
underneath my eyes guess what guys not
using my strollers fresh and flawless
I'm going to use the Rimmel lasting
finish powder foundation I don't know
what color Oh silky beige I had this for
ages and I've hardly ever used it so
gonna use it today oh my god feels me
weird not to have as strong as my face
I'm kidding
I'm actually like emotionally attached
to that product I swear and I'm just
going to brush off the baked okay I'm
gonna try out this bronzer is the
Maybelline Dream Sun which looks like
that
it not know that it sounds like
sunscreen if it's orange I swear to God
look so I knock knock knees it looks
orange plus it broke so okay so for
bronze I'm just going to use the essence
Sun Club and brunettes and I'm just
going to use that on my favorite brush
on an everyday basis I don't bake my
contour because usually don't have that
much time to so I'm just going on Denise
edge your little under my lip then I'm
just lightly contouring the sides of my
nose then I'm just putting some around
the forehead of ethereal take the blush
I'm going to use the L'Oreal Paris
rosewood blush just looks like that's I
bought this brush on eBay and I was like
oh my god that looks so cute like it's a
love heart but it actually looks like a
ballsack like Alex saw and he was just
like why does your brush look like a
ball sack I never really noticed until
he pointed it out and I was like well
then but it's really cute on your knees
here's the ball sack brush yeah placing
that by the way it's not you're not a
very good brush just it just looks
pretty weird just going to place that on
the cheeks
you're not going to lie I don't actually
have a proper drugstore highlighter I
think it's just because I live in
Australia and there isn't really much of
a variety of drugstore highlighters
slash even if there is any life I never
find some in my local price line maybe
I'm just looking in the wrong places but
I do have this essence blew me up I
shadow which looks like that I used to
always use this for the inner corners of
my eyes it's really really pigmented and
that's um it's like a white color so I'm
going to use that for my highlight today
oh yeah that's so nice what do you know
I shadow to make really good Harder's as
well that's so nice
flipping salt on my lip and nurse area
the brows i'm just using the essence
brow kit in medium and just filling my
brows this used to be like my favorite
brow product once again the camera
stopped recording and i didn't realize
until after I finished my eye shadow but
I'm just going to explain to really
quickly what you guys miss so I use the
chichi cosmetics classics palette and I
just used that brown color and I just
use that as a transition shade and just
buff that into my crease and then I just
used this shimmery white shade from the
palette and then just place that all
over my lid and then I've just grabbed
the dark brown shade and just place that
on the outer corners and that's all I've
done up until now I'm just concentrating
that on the outer corners I'm just going
to grab a bigger blending brush and just
blend out any harsh lines so I recently
just found this which I could have used
for my highlighter but I really like to
use this on the inner corners of my eyes
so basically it's just like a cream to
powder highlighter so we're maybe I'll
try it on my cheek
so go to my hand it like goes on a cream
that it dry as a powder so strange but
it's so cool a much whoa
so I'm going to grab a bit of that I
light up and place that in my inner
corner because I really want
that's intense if I usually really do
like an intense inner corner highlight I
didn't think this would be that intense
to be honest so now for my lower
lashline I'm just going to take that
first transition color again and just
use that to add a bit of color on the
lower lash line
now I'm going the darker color which is
just next to it just there and I'm just
kind of like using that as well just
over the top sometimes I put a new to my
waterline sometimes I leave it blank
today I think I'm just going to leave it
blank I don't think it really needs
anything okay so I'm going to use the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner pot for
my liner
I don't usually do anything dramatic
just something really subtle I'm not
going to speak so soon it'll probably
end up being like a monster wing so I'm
just going
you
if I'm asked I'm going to use the new
room or one and it is called the volume
colorist mascara with lashed into
complex looks like that I just got it
the other day and that's the one oh it's
not too bad actually pretty good
I'm not usually like a fan of room or
mascara is because I really can't feel
me but this one's really good if I'm
wearing when planner I'm wearing lashes
because my lashes obviously aren't long
enough and I feel like a look of it
naked around the eyes but not wearing
lashes so I'm going to put on some
falsies I'm just going to use the last
parade lashes in the style French press
they look like this they're not true
glam but they're not basic pilots I'm
going to use the essence lip liner in
satin mo which is a old favorite of mine
and if you know me you know I use these
colors like on a daily basis so
literally the best color ever yes if the
lips don't freak out all the other girls
will know what this bread or guys
although what this friends called and
about 90% of you will be like that brand
is
but seriously trust me this Ulta 3
lipstick in brown sugar is life I bought
this like three years ago and I'm almost
done it's honestly the best nude and the
formula is amazing like I did have a
look at that other lipsticks and most of
them have like glitter and in them
so obviously I'm not really a fan of
that but they were only a few like matte
finish lipsticks so I'm going to show
you what it looks like it's amazing my
friend from work
like at a restaurant had it on like she
always used to wear I'll be like what is
on your lips so that's a lip color how
amazing is it how many is it I used to
use this religiously every day for like
three years is color like it's amazing
the formula amazing it's not very
long-lasting like the lipsticks only
three dollars or something um you can
get it from Terry White chemists so I'm
pretty sure they have like those little
altar stalls or like pharmacies I don't
know if you can get it from my valise or
Kohl's but next time you're at the shops
and you're going past a chemist get it
so good
brown sugar by Ulta free so yeah I'm
going to go and do my hair because it's
drying really really frizzy so I'll be
right back I'm going to add in a little
bit of a rant to this video just because
I wanted to prove the point that you
don't need to buy all this expensive
luxury makeup to look this good I'm not
saying I look good but but I used
products basically under $15 each and I
would still look the same if I use my
luxury products today so look I do have
luxury products luxury products are
amazing but I never use them because I'm
just like no I paid like $150 for that
I'm not going to use it because I don't
want to waste it what's the point of
even buying it if you're not even going
to use it like fair enough if you buy
expensive makeup and you use it but the
way my mind works is when I buy
something expensive I'm like don't want
to use it don't want to waste it I'm
just going to keep it in the back of my
drawer forever so why not just buy a
bottle makeup that you're just going to
use everyday because it's not going to
cost as much to repurchase okay that's
my little rant over I'm not dissing
people that you know buy luxury
makeup item that's just me that's just
me but anyways thanks for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys
