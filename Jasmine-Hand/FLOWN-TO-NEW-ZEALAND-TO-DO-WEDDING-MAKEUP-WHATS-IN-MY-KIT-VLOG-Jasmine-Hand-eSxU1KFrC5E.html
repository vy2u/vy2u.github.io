welcome to today's video because we of
love anyways I'm off to New Zealand to
do some wedding makeup so I'm super
excited to vlog and I usually blog so
take it easy we please these gems waking
up at 3 &amp;amp; 2 cups Airport go on
5 seconds of fame and with your ad
what's your ass I will probably just
close or not the airport because it's
still pitch black
my way hey guys so I'm in at my hotel
room now I checked in about three hours
ago but I literally as soon as I got
here I just went to sleep because I was
kind of jetlag I know that sounds weird
because it's only like three hours
difference but I was just so tired
because I only had like three hours
sleep actually off to do the bride trial
to the wedding's actually tomorrow and
we thought we may as well do a trial
like a day before just while I'm here
just because I think it'd be a bit silly
to like fly all the way over to me for a
trial and she was pretty like adamant to
book me so I'm literally just having a
bite to eat now she's going to come pick
me up in about 15 minutes and I'm off to
do a trial she didn't say she didn't
want anything on social media or
anything like that but I don't think
I'll be able to film the makeup but I'll
try to tomorrow I'm getting a few clips
of the makeup and like the bridesmaids
and stuff as we'll probably come back
here to my hotel room and show you guys
actually what I have in my kit because
I've actually gotten heaps of requests
lately to do like an updated freelance
cute videos when I get back tonight I'm
going to lay everything out and show you
exactly what I carry my kit for those
that are wondering so I'm off now but
I'll chat to you really soon hey guys so
it's the next day now it's the wedding
day and I'm about to go and get some
breakfast before I get picked up from my
hotel I'll try it as much footage at the
wedding as possible even though she said
she wants to keep everything off social
media which is completely understandable
like I would hate
my guess to see what I look like and
what my bridesmaids look like before
they actually walk down the aisle
hopefully it should be okay but when I
get back from the hotel I'm going to
unpack my kit with you guys and show you
exactly what I pack and how I like
sterilized and clean all my stuff I
probably won't be able to deep clean my
brushes here usually what I would do is
I would go back to my salon and deep
clean my brushes but probably just spot
clean them for you guys on camera and
just yes show you guys what I am packed
so I'm going to get something to eat and
I'll hopefully blog when I get there
we're falling in my morning planning let
you focus on good day people feel me
like the light I just come we must not
delay so I've just got back from the
wedding and I'm so happy with how all
the makeup turned out it was so so
lovely and they love the makeup too so
I'm actually going to go and unpack I'm
a cupcake I didn't actually end up
taking my diesel car because it's so
heavy on its own and whereas this one is
just like a really small suitcase it
weighs like not even a CLO on a time
whereas look away I think like four or
five alone and you're only allowed 7
kilos carry on so that's why I just use
this I did was I just put all of the
clear cases in this suitcase so I've got
4 of them Oh God
just kind of like put everything
everywhere but yeah so that's what I
carry it all in it's super handy I
always have to have baby wipes on me
they're so handy if you're a makeup
artist it's because I always get like
eyeliner and eye shadows back on my
hands I'll just use that after every
client just to wipe it off because
makeup wipes a really expensive like
they're like $5 to 20 whereas I mean
this was like 2 dollars and you get 80
wipes so I always use these other users
on my face so I would never use these on
my face I used to and I don't know it
just kind of like drive up my skin and
doesn't make it feel as nice as when you
use makeup like proper makeup wipes but
in the first case I have all of my
foundations so I bring my most used
matte shades I actually asked the bride
if they're all going to be faked and if
there's any women with color or anyone
that's relatively like pale just so I
knew exactly what to pack for the
have to pack every single color because
that's what I would usually do if I had
like a wedding on the Gold Coast I would
pack like all of my foundations so I
only packed like Tanner shades and of
course a few lighter shades just in case
and then a few darker so I ended up just
bringing NC 20 which is actually what I
used on the bride she wasn't as panned
as I thought she would be
I bought these tart ones because I don't
know I don't even know why I brought
them I don't use them as often as the
Mac I bought the Marc Jacobs remarkable
in case they needed extra coverage I
didn't end up using it though and c37
which is what I used on most of the
bridesmaids that's like one of the most
popular colors and it's e15 just in case
and Born This Way in sand which is like
a really good color for fake tan bought
some of the scalar ones that I've
recently been liking I don't know why I
bought them I just did I always overpack
bought some concealers I don't know why
I always pack these but never use them
who knows and then I just got MC 42 and
NC 4 just in case they were like really
turned NC 30 which is what I mixed with
some of the bridesmaids and then the
knives Punjab Foundation which is a
really popular color as well so yeah so
in the next clear case I have a bunch of
staff so I love this Oprah highlighter
for highlighting the what they called
collarbone I was like what am I trying
to say I love this island for
collarbones and then I've got my
Australis fresh and flawless
of course this bronzer which is my
favorite your face is Australia powder
for baking the contour Mac Studio Fix
powder soft and gentle one of my
favorite highlighters and then I've got
my mac fix+
nice pressed powder in Beach then I've
got the hots liner the pop liner a sharp
cigar one of my favorite gold which is
the Urban Decay half-baked
- literally the prettiest gold I love it
easy today actually and I just got some
mini Urban Decay setting spray so I've
got both of them and then I've got some
top concealers sydney la girl Pro
concealer the color correcting one
benefit Mac professional the pony
mascara NARS concealer what else
Rimmel blog and lash glue so yes that's
what's in there and then some just poor
boy in case their lips a chap and need
some lip balm in the third case I have
all of my palettes so I usually put them
at the bottom but I have my Anasazi at
Pro brow palette makeup by Mario palette
love it
the kylie burgundy palette the hooter
Beauty rose gold and then I just got the
UH Nastasia contour kit which is that
and then in here I've got some lashes I
use model rock in Mike's here these ones
are my favorite model rock ones the two
one two and I also love the two three
sixes as well that's so pretty
and I get them in the bulk pack and then
I've got my haul a bronzer hot mama
blush Laura Mercier translucent and then
I've got the RCM a no color powder in
there that I just put it in the Laura
Mercier packaging a fresh fit me and
then lasers all my lip products some
Gerard cosmetics liquid lipsticks then
I've got the kylie rose gold the
anastacio just black gel liner the Urban
Decay single eyeshadow in the shade is
the bride then just be tight
I like I don't even know I bought this
and I bought the other ones and then
these MAC lipsticks I bought cherish and
miss this one is called kind of sexy
it's just like a kind of like a peachy
color but it's a bit darker and this is
honey love a really popular shade as
for Bridal then brought velvet teddy of
course a really really popular shade as
well
another popular shade is called angel
it's just like a really pretty baby pink
color I actually use that on the
bridesmaids today and then probably one
of the most popular bridal shade is
called faux by Mac and I'm literally out
like I was scraping the side I didn't
realize how out it was so so pretty I
love this color back to what in has got
some and to ride cosmetics lip liners I
brought new shirt and bel-air and I just
bought a red to match the red if I used
it a nude eyeliner this is just a rim or
one in case I wanted to use that in the
waterline and then I put some astrology
and essence ones they're like my
favorite nude and then a Laura Mercier
one which is like a dusty pink
it's called plum Barry um what else is
in here and then just a real new one as
well but yeah and then lastly I decided
to bring my melted lipstick in that
Chihuahua i'ts are really pretty like
muted pink as well and then this over
our Laguna Beach liquid lipstick as well
but I did end up using them so that's
what's in this case I literally just
stick my pallets anywhere but I did
bring my Z palette with some makeup
Keegan and the stars your eyeshadows as
well so that is creme brulee and that's
frappe not sure what those colors are
but these are the colors in my Z palette
I like using that one through that's hot
chocolate by anna salvia and then that's
Sienna by anastasiya so pretty I love
this color right here it's called
whimsical and it's by makeup geek I use
in the inner corners heaps
this one's called white gold no soft
gold by anastasiya sorry so pretty fit
in the corners as well
and then I think this one's starry-eyed
by makeup geek it says foiled eyeshadows
so pretty doesn't it look like it would
be like really bright but once you like
put it on
so so pretty and then yeah so I bought
that then I brought my Modern
Renaissance palette of course because
the bride wanted like a plummy pinky
Goldy eyes so I brought heat to those
hunters palette and then obviously metal
plate that study that I haven't cleaned
and then these are just all my dried
cosmetics lipsticks tea potted into this
I actually bought this case from eBay it
was fake whatever was in there literally
smelt ranked like the lipstick so in
here originally it was like I think it
was like five dollars actually can't
find this anymore so yeah but then eBay
would have like similar things to this
anyways this is just a wedge sponge that
needs cleaning and then what's left is
brushes so I'm going to show you how I
spot clean my brushes in between clients
so I use the Scotty's makeup brush
cleaner it's amazing
by the way these are my bullies I get
them from eBay as well they're just the
silicon ones
so what I usually do I'm going to put
this here so it's like a hard surface
this is just paper towel that I use so
what I like to do is obviously I can't
do this because I don't have two hands
but I just usually spray like one or two
sprays on the brush get a dirty brush
and then just just so hard with one hand
clean it like this I love this stuff
because the bristles drive basically
instantly so I don't have to wait or
anything to use them on the next clients
so that is literally all I do to clean
my brushes I'll try and do one that's a
bit dirtier okay let's get my Mac to one
seven
it's so good so that was basically like
black and now the brush is like clean so
yeah that is literally what I do to
clean my brushes hey guys so I'm now
back home on the Gold Coast New Zealand
was amazing I just would have never
thought in a million years when I
started my business that someone would
be willing to fly me overseas for me to
do their wedding makeup I feel oh no I
just feel so special and grateful to
have had that opportunity I can't wait
for more opportunities like that
I love love traveling so yeah I hope you
