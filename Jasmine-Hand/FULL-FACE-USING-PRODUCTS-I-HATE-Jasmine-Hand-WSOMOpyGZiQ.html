straight in today's video I'll be doing
the makeup tutorial with products
I hate tag again all over YouTube and I
don't know why but they're just crack me
up just like watching people put on
makeup they hate I don't know why but I
just find it so funny so I thought I
would jump on the bandwagon and a film
it as well to be honest I haven't really
found a primer that I haven't liked or
have found that hasn't worked on my skin
like I don't even know like if a prom is
good or not I don't know it is that
weird for me not to know so I'm just
going to go ahead and just use a primer
just a prime I try to find one that I
like haven't really used but I just
don't really have that many primers in
general and I don't want to like say I
hate this primer when I don't so sorry I
don't have a primer that I don't like so
now on to foundation now I did also
struggle to find one that I hated
because usually if I don't like
something I usually just throw it away
or give it to my family and friends so I
have more room for stuff that I actually
like so I did actually go through all my
drawers and remember that when I first
put the Milani conceal in perfect
two-in-one on it was okay it just went
patchy throughout the day like I don't
think I would ever wear this again it's
also a really thick consistency
foundation or that is bad so I'm not
even sure if this is going to match me
and after I put it on the first time it
was like really sticky I don't know like
it's got really good coverage and for
the price that's amazing I think it's
only like $10 u.s. but I don't know it
just didn't really work as well as I
thought on my skin it's quite a good
color for my fake tan I like that it's
yellow based but it's just really really
sticky and it's root-like it looks
really oily I'm just going to go over
that all with a Beauty Blender to be
honest it doesn't actually look that bad
like there's probably worse foundations
out there
I could have put on today and shown you
but I just don't have them like right
now so the concealer I really do not
like is the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye concealer this one's in the
shade neutral medium I don't know if
it's the color I don't know if it's the
consistency but I'm just I don't know
I'm just not a fan so I'm just going to
pop that underneath my eyes and I'm not
even sure what the other side is like
supposed to before it says it's a
brightness so I'm gonna mix that in with
it I guess
yeah not it's not covering anything now
to bake the under-eye area I'm going to
go in with the Tarte smooth operator
Amazonian clay finish powder I had
really high hopes for this but I got it
I love Tarte like they are amazing and I
don't know it's just something about
this like it's so finely milled I swear
the first time I put it on I like
coughed it and it went into my lungs
that's how thin it is like it's
basically almost air that's how thin the
powder is if you can kind of see it I'm
just going to try not to breathe in I'm
just going to pack it on my Beauty
Blender and just put it underneath my
eyes as you can see I breathe it in
actually can't a car deal holy I
look scary then to set the rest of my
face I'm going to go in with the
Maybelline fit me powder in the shade
230 I just remember the first time I use
it I was like mm it's okay it's not like
bad but it's not good so I haven't used
it ever since
obviously cuz I have other powders that
I prefer to use oh my god okay I'm going
to assume you guys up for this can you
guys see like the pause that's coming
out and being like emphasized from this
powder yuck
so I'm not really a fan of using brow
pencils so the one that I really didn't
like when I first used it is the
Maybelline brow satin it's just in a
pencil and then on the end
has like a little sponge tip but it's
filled with powder I know I just freak
out sometimes using pencils because I
feel like see it kind of looks like a
block rail I do really like the
Anastasia brow Wiz but I don't know I
just don't really reach for them as much
as I reach for the pomade and the powder
you also don't really have that much
control with a pencil at the side of the
brow like you can't really make it look
soft if you get what I mean
so I'm going to go on two eyes now I'm
going to leave the bait underneath in
case I get fallout which I probably will
cuz I don't know if this a shadow
palette looks a bit dodgy this palette
swatched really really nicely on my
fingers like you can see like the
pigment looks like fairly decent for a
drugstore palette but I actually tried
this on my eyes one time and I was like
ah like is that it like it's not
pigmented at all it wasn't the best to
blend so I'm going to give it another
shot I'm going to go in with this shade
which is like the closest shade through
like a transition color and use that in
my crease you can't even see it
literally can't even tell I just did
that to be honest
Oh My gods will come out under eyes now
I don't know if you can see that up
close but it's pretty horrific alright I
think I'm just going to go in with like
the gold I guess it's going to use it on
my finger
so hopefully
can't even say it like legit I'm gonna
go in with a darker color maybe this
navy blue sort of random oh okay this
one actually looks pigmented thank God
okay
hmm no I don't even know what I'm doing
but be really nice if I have like a
brown in there a lot a lot of Fallout is
happening yeah not this one's not
working for me actually this is actually
the color of a bruise
far out area let's grab like the green
or something it's like an emerald like a
light emerald green and just like pop
that somewhere these colors remind me of
the swamp to be honest okay I'm going to
finally wipe off the bake oh my god you
can see my redness underneath my eyes my
god no it literally looks like I have a
white cast I'm - my eyes and that's all
completely off No alright going in with
um the swamp color underneath my eye
ball okay I'm just using the bruise
color underneath can't get over that it
looks like I have flashback no I can't
okay so for later I'm going to do a wing
I haven't really used this properly but
just looking at it it looks like a
textile like I don't know I would never
ever use this as lighter like ever it
literally just feels like I'm using a
black sharpie it's not too bad though
but I don't know how I'm gonna go and
create a wing with it if you're a
beginner and you were using this I
reckon you would have the worst time
because this is so hard for mascara I'm
going to use the galactic big lash
affair when I first open this I was like
whoa that is a massive wand and I tried
it and it just didn't do anything for my
lashes so I'm going to apply that so to
bronze and contour I'm going to be using
the
see I'm taught by Australis oh my god I
hate this palette so much I really do
love their highlighting shades though
I've obviously like hit pan and finish
that one I used to always use that to
set my eyelids but I haven't repurchased
this palette just because I didn't like
the powder that much to purchase the
whole thing again I'm actually scared
for my life to use this again so I'm
gonna go in with oh no no I just put way
too much on oh oh my god did you
see that
oh my god please blend user underneath
no I look like I went to the swamp and
rolled in mud alright let's use this
powder to bake again I'm just going to
not breathe the next like 30 seconds
okay so for blush I'm going to use the
Maybelline master glaze in the shade
pink fever
I hate cream blushes and like cream
highlighters I don't see the point in
them especially after you've set your
face like I get if you want like a
really natural flushed look and you just
put like a little bit of BB cream a
little bit of this on bit of highlighter
and you're out but like I love full glam
and I would never stick a cream over a
powder so like I would never use this
I've used it I think once or something
and ya know I just just did not like how
it looked on my skin and it's not
particularly a color that I would go for
I'm going to use my foundation brush to
blend it in where did it go okay there
we go and now my powder and foundation
has separated okay for highlighter I've
had this for a while used it once didn't
like it at all never use it again it's
the color pop lunch money super shock
cheek palate when I made my color pop
order like six months ago
I just thought all of these were like
powder base highlighters and like single
eyeshadows but then what I'm going to
swatch it it's kind of like it feels
like a powder and a cream and then when
I put it on I was like you know I just
don't get the point of cream highlighter
I don't get it
I do not understand and I never will
ever
that highlighter is not cute not I'm
going to brush off this bake I literally
cannot get over how my face looks right
now I'm done so lastly for lip
this was not hard to pick a lip product
that I hated it's the Australis velour
lips matte cream it's so annoying
because I absolutely love the color of
this I just hate the formula and I
always have they're just crack doesn't
look nice on your lips it's
uncomfortable the smell is actually
really nice and
the smell but it's just a formula I hate
it so I'm going to put that all over but
first I'm going to line I'm going to use
this savvy lip liner in the shade bear
it literally like has no pigment at all
okay then I'm going to go in with this
again so hot you as well to set the rest
of my face I'm going to go in with the
pixi by petra makeup fixing mist so I
don't know if I got a dodgy one but it
like I don't know it just like sprays
like projectile spray so I'm literally
zooming you guys up I can't deal ready
oh my god that's stealing well that's my
makeup guys hope you loved it this is
the final look I hope you guys found it
funny I'm I just feel so disgusting
right now I literally just can't wait to
wash it all off but thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
