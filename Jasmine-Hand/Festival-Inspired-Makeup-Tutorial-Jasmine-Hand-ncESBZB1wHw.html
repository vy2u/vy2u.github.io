so I'm gonna get straight into it for
primer I'm using the Too Faced hangover
primer and as you can see I'm just
putting that all over at my face then
I'm going in with the second primer this
is the benefit Porefessional I just had
heaps of lumps and bumps around my nose
and chin area and I find that this stuff
is amazing for smoothing that all out so
I'm just placing that there then for
brows I'm going in with the NARS I'm not
sure what this product is called but
it's basically like a brow pomade I'll
leave a list down below of everything I
used anyways and just using that to it
fill in at my brows
then going in with the heart-shaped tape
concealer this one's in the shade at
light/medium and I'm just using that to
define the brow so I just place a little
bit on the top and the bottom just to
make this shape really nice and crisp
then going in with the new urban decay
foundation I'm using the shades three
and five now when I first put it on it
may seem really light but I've actually
used this prior to this video and it
oxidizes so much like it goes about a
shade and a half darker than it does
when you originally put it on so that's
why it may look a little bit light and
crazy now but I promise after it's all
blended out and I set it in everything
it literally matches perfectly so I'm
just placing that all over my face and
then I'm blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender by the way I thought I
would add this is actually a really good
foundation I love the coverage obviously
I don't like how it oxidizes so just
keep in mind when you are buying it to
get at least a shade lighter than your
actual skin color perfect for fake tan
because it does have like a little bit
of an orange II sort of like undertone
when it oxidizes which is great because
I fake tan and I'm kind of a little bit
orange so yeah I just thought I would
quickly mention that but yeah it's a
really really good foundation then
taking the tight shape type concealer
again in light/medium and I'm using this
to highlight my under eye area down the
bridge of my nose a bit on my forehead
Cupid's bow and chin area and then I go
to it blend it all out I've also really
really been enjoying this concealer it
has awesome coverage I'm not sure about
the huge doe foot applicator like it's
pretty hard to use when you're trying to
like highlight the center of your face
but otherwise really great concealer
definitely on par with the Maybelline
fit me it's got definitely more coverage
than the Maybelline fit me if you're
wanting more coverage and then I'm going
in with the shape type concealer again I
think this is in the shade deep and I'm
attempting to cream contour again and I
actually liked how it turned out so
maybe I should get into cream contouring
I don't know now I'm just blending out
the highlighted bits first and then I go
in to blend the contoured areas
then going in with the laura mercier
translucent powder and using that to
bake the under eye area so I'm just
placing a heap of it on the damp Beauty
Blender that we use before and just
packing it underneath the eyes then
going in with my fav pressed powder the
Australis fresh and flawless this one's
in the shade medium tan which is the
darker shade I believe they really need
to make darker shades oh my god and I'm
just using that to set the rest of my
face so as you can see my face is kind
of matched my body now how crazy is that
it oxidizes so much I don't know why
like I don't know a company would like
allow that maybe that's like why the
formula is so good I don't know but now
I'm bronzing with the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer I'm loving this
recently oh my god and I'm just using
that on a angled spectrum cosmetics
brush and using that true kind of bronze
and contour my cheeks
then taking these sweethearts blush I'm
unsure of the name but I'll leave it
listed down below it's just a really
beautiful glowy blush and I'm just
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
then spring my brush with a bit of fixed
place first going in with the anastasia
beverly hills moonchild palette and
taking purple horseshoe and applying
that on my cheekbones and I am obsessed
with this color oh my god I was gonna do
pink then I was like now I've already
done that and I feel like the purple
really complements like the blue and my
hair and the blue in my outfit so yeah
and then for eyes I took in spoke from
Bible and Instagram she's incredible I
love her and I'm going in with the
violet vos palette taking at that nice
transition shade and using that in at my
crease
then taking uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
Sienna and I'm also working that into
the crease I kind of went heavy with
this especially in the inner corner area
just because we're gonna do the cut
crease soon so yeah I'm like really
packing it on just to make sure it's
really really intense then going in with
the taut shape tape concealer again just
on a concealer brush and carving out the
crease
then just saying that with a translucent
powder or any like white or cream
colored eyeshadow it will do then I'm
taking that gorgeous wine color and I'm
just using that in my crease as well to
intensify it a bit more then going in
with teddy bear which is a really pretty
purple brown and packing that on the
outer corners of the eyes only and then
blending it out
then taking that same shade I'm just
using that to sweep under the lower lash
line
then taking americano by makeup cake
this one's slightly darker than teddy
bear from the violet Voss palette and
I'm using that to intensify the outer
corners even more
then taking the moonchild palette again
I'm going in with pink heart and I'm
using that to highlight the inner
corners and my brow bone
then taking the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner pot in black and I'm using
that to line my waterline then taking a
teddy bear again which was that purpley
brown shade and I'm using that to smoke
that liner out
then from a scar I'm taking the Too
Faced better than sex and just coating
my top and lower lashes then taking the
billion lashes in this style a liar and
just popping them on
then Phillips I'm taking at Kylie
cosmetics candy Kay and using that true
line at my lips
then going in with the candy K and matte
liquid lipstick also by Kylie cosmetics
then going in with one of her metal
liquid lipsticks this one's in the shade
hair and I was kind of going for like an
ombre look but it kind of failed so I
just place that in the middle of my lips
then went in with one of her glosses
unsure of the shade I'll leave it linked
down below and then yeah I'm just
placing that all over the lips and
finally to set the face I'm taking the
Gerard cosmetics lay all days setting
spray and that is the final look I hope
you guys enjoyed watching I'll leave all
the links true where I got my outfit my
necklaces and where I got my hair done
down below it so if you liked this video
