detailed foundation routine just so I
can attach the link of this video into
my future videos to save you guys from
watching me do my face over and over
again so if you'd like to know how I do
my foundation then please keep watching
okay so the first thing I do after I
cleanse my face in the morning or
whenever I put on makeup I always
cleanse my face and then i apply my
Dermalogica active moist moisturizer
this is amazing if you have oily skin
it's just probably the best moisturizer
I've ever ever used in my life so after
about ten minutes I wait for that to
kind of set into my skin and then I go
ahead and put on my hourglass vo primer
this is probably my favorite primer ever
if I'm not wearing this I'm either
wearing this which is a stealer one-step
correct so today I decided to put on my
hourglass we need like one squirt for my
face just because I don't really want to
use too much because it is super
expensive I guess I don't usually like
to put my foundation on straight away I
kind of like let that kind of sink into
my skin usually when that's happening
I'll do my eyebrows but I'm gonna do a
in-depth brow tutorial so I'm just gonna
wait a little bit before I apply my
foundation okay so the foundation that
I'm going to use today is my Revlon
Colorstay it's a old favorite and I
haven't worn it for ages now but I use
the one for combination slash oily skin
if you guys didn't know they have
different bottles for different skin
types I think there's combination to dry
normal to combination and then
combination to oily so I obviously pick
up the combination to oily skin and this
in the color 250 fresh braids I think
this color will most kind of suit my
fading tan at the moment so I'm just
gotten to squirt a few pumps on the
metal slab I got this from eBay and it
came with a little mixing spatula I
think it was like ten dollars and it
came with him like two days I just seem
to put it on this rather than the back
of my hand because
your hand obviously can absorb some
product and I don't really like wasting
so I'm just going to pump two three
pumps onto this thingamabob and then
with my damp Beauty Blender I'm just
going to first dot the foundation on my
face and then just blend it in using
dabbing motion you don't want to guide
this because it will pretty much just
rub the foundation straight off and it
won't give you as flawless of a finish
then dabbing does if you're not willing
to spend $30 on one of these you can get
the Real Techniques miracle sponge from
price I think they're about $12 but if
you go onto I hope comm you can actually
pick them up for $6 I have a discount
code that I will link down below I think
you get like $10 or 10% off your first
order I can't remember but I'll link
everything down below so I'm just
working that into my skins is probably
the most important step for creating a
flawless base so you're gonna want to
spend the most time doing this step ok
so these parts of my nose always gather
foundation so what I like to do is lift
it up and really pack the product there
just with the tail
okay so next this has only been in my
foundation routine for like a few weeks
now
it is the l'oreal glam bronze liquid
bronzer and i'm going to shake it up
because last time heaps of what it came
out of it just want to make sure you
shake it and then you only need like two
or three drops of this I'm just going to
put that on here as well I just put four
drops great and then I like screw it use
that with this kind of stippling brush I
got this from eBay you can get it in a
set with five brushes and I think they
were like five dollars or something I'll
leave everything down below if you're
interested so what I'm actually doing is
just placing it on the bits where eyes
usually bronze so here all up my temples
on my jaw while under my chin to hide
the double chin going on there and then
what you want to do is just blend it and
when you're blending it blend it upwards
okay so next I'm just going to conceal
my under eye area I'm just going to be
using my Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
the color NC 15 so I'm just going to
apply that with a synthetic narrow sort
of brush this product is really thick so
you're going to have to work really
really quickly with it so after that you
just grab your Beauty Blender and make
sure it's dead and just work that in to
your under eye area so I don't usually
like highlighting the middle of my face
with that concealer because it is really
thick so I like to use my instant age
rewind concealer in the color fair clear
just to highlight my forehead down the
bridge of my nose on my Cupid's bow and
here and if I'm going out I would
highlight underneath my contour but I
don't want it to be so drastic so I'm
just going to stick with that and then
just blending it in
okay now to set my under eye area I'm
just going to take my favorite setting
powder which is the bed night luxury
banana powder and I'm just going to take
that on my Beauty Blender and patting
that where I just applied that Mac Pro
Longwear I'm just going to take this
kind of tapered brush and just use that
to get in the parts of my noses where it
separates okay so now that my concealer
is all set in place I'm just going to
set the rest of my face with my
Australia's fresh and flawless and I'm
just going to take that on my Too Faced
kabuki brush I got this for my birthday
so I probably wouldn't have it if my
friend didn't buy it for me but any big
fluffy kabuki brush will do the job
and then because I get a really really
oily t-zone I like to put the essence
all about Matt fix loose powder it's
just a white sort of translucent powder
and I just like to put that down my
t-zone so next up I bronze my face using
my essence Sun Club bronzer for
brunettes I only pick this one up the
other week actually probably about three
weeks ago or something I absolutely love
the way that this looks on my skin tone
so I'm just going to apply this with my
101 Lux face to find a brush by Zoe bar
and I'm just putting that in the places
where I put the cream runs up
and then to contour I use my hoola by
benefit it's my favorite contouring
products ever I'm not really going for a
harsh contour today so I'm just going to
use this angled Jessop brush and just
pop in that
in the hollows of my cheeks
a little bit on my forehead
under a fight chin and a little bit
underneath my lips okay so now for
contouring my nose I'm not usually a
really big nose contouring gal but to
contour to I'm just going to use my
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I'm
just going to use that color called fawn
I'm just going to use that on my 109
luxe face paint brush by zoeva this is
the brush that I usually use to contour
my cheekbones but once again I'm gonna
say it again and again and again if you
don't have a brush like this you can
just grab any fluffy brush and just put
two bobby pins on either side and that
will create that narrow kind of brush
top for a nice contour okay and for
blush I'm not usually a big blush fan
but the blush that I always use is my
Mac well dress blush it's just a really
nice light pink shade it's not very
pigmented or overpowering so I just like
to put that on the backs of my cheeks
just to give my skin a little bit of a
flush so last but not least the
highlighter that I will be using is my
hourglass ambient lighting palette it
comes with three colors I actually
really don't know what the colors are
okay okay I'm gonna struggle with
pronouncing these so this color in the
middle is called incandescent light and
this is the shade that I used for
highlighting my cheekbones my Cupid's
bow and down the bridge of my nose this
color here which is the darkest color of
the palette is called dim light and I
like to dust that over my contour just
makes it look so natural even though I
know contouring is not natural but I
just love the look and this first color
here is called radiant light and you're
supposed to dust that all over your face
but I'm not really a fan of the whole
glowy look especially because I do have
oily skin
even though I use Mac products it just
always turns out looking Jewish so so
I'm just going to use my 105 luxe
highlight brush by Zoe and then taking
incandescent light I'm just going to be
popping that on the highest points of my
cheekbones and to my brow bone and I
kind of reverse see shape and then I'm
just going to go a bit more on my
Cupid's bow down the bridge of my nose a
little bit on the tip I'm just going to
grab dim light which is the darkest one
just on my bronzing brush and just
sweeping that over my contour it's
really subtle but it just I don't know
what it makes it look like it just makes
it look so amazing I know I'm really
weird and so this pretty much is my
flawless foundation routine if I'm going
out clubbing or if I just want a really
flawless face for going to work shopping
anything in general if I want to put a
full face of makeup on this is the
routine that I use thank you guys so
