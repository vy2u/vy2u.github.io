hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so first up I'm just going in with a
makeup remover just to ensure the face
is nice and clean before priming for
primer I'm using the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue and I'm just
applying that all over a face with a
small stippling brush then I'm going in
with the Mac no I was going to say
studio fix fix plus spray just before
foundation and the foundation that I
used was the Mac Studio Fix in NC 37 and
just placing it on her face first before
blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender
then taking the best concealer ever the
Maybelline fit me in the shade ten light
and just using that to highlight and
conceal her under eye area and then I go
to place it on her chin at Cupid's bow
and then down the bridge of her nose and
a little bit on her forehead and then I
just blend it out again with the damp
Beauty Blender
then I'm taking some of the laura
mercier translucent powder just on the
same Beautyblender and just packing it
underneath the eyes to set the concealer
then using my uh nastasi Beverly Hills
Pro brow palette I'm taking the shade
soft brown and really lightly filling in
her brows
I hate touching Brooklyn's brows because
they're literally perfect so I just only
really fill in the really sparse areas
and then I go ahead to conceal
underneath them just with the same
Maybelline fit me concealer in light
then four-eyes first up I'm going in
with creme brulee by makeup geek and
using that in her crease as a transition
shade or leave everything that I use
down below I'm in case you forget then
going in with makeup geek cosmetics
frappe and I'm also placing that in the
crease just to make it a little bit more
defined then going in with cocoa bear
and really concentrating this in the
crease socket just because we're going
to be doing a cut crease so I want most
of the color
I'm the darker color I mean to be in the
crease so I'm just adding a product and
then blending it out then to cut the
crease I'm taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in light again and as you can
see I am literally just cutting the
crease so if you can't find your clients
crease or even your crease just open
your eyes first and then literally just
draw a line above where your crease is
just so you can make a like make the
illusion of like a bigger crease area if
you get what I mean
so hopefully just by watching it you can
learn so and then I'm just connecting
that up to the end of the eyelid it's
probably easier for you guys just watch
than me try to explain
I'm so bad at explaining things but yeah
then taking Anastasi Beverly Hills
single eyeshadow in a fudge I'm just
using that on a pencil brush to define
the crease so I'm just applying that
just above the cut crease area and then
I go ahead to apply Mac's tan pigment
which is literally like one of my
favorite pigments at the moment it's
like a gorgeous rich rose gold color and
yeah I'm just literally placing that all
over the lid
then taking the NYX glam liner in aqua
luxe I can't remember what shade it's
called but it's like a rose gold e-type
color
I'll leave the shade down below for you
guys but I'm just literally going just
underneath the cut crease I don't know
I've seen heaps of photos and videos on
Instagram with this kind of makeup style
and I thought I would try it out and I
really really liked how it turned out so
I'm just literally going straight
underneath the crease and then I'm just
wiping off the excess baked underneath
the eyes then going in with the
Australis fresh and flawless face powder
in the shade medium tan and just using
that to set the rest of her face
then taking the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner in black to use for the wing
so I like to map out the wing first and
then I go ahead to line the top lash
line I have a video on how to do winged
line on my channel if you're interested
so yeah I'm just doing her wing and then
for bronzer I'm using the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer and just using that
on an angled brush and just bronzing up
her face
then I'm taking frappe single eyeshadow
by makeup geek and using that to use to
smoke out her lower lashline and then
I'm just using some mascara to coach her
lashes Jack she had eyelash extensions
on so yeah she allowed me to put some
mascara on just because of the fallout
from the pigment I usually do put
mascara on with people with eyelash
extensions I just think it looks ten
times better and then to contour her
cheekbones I'm just using hoola by
benefit and then I lost the footage of
me putting the Maybelline eye studio in
her waterline so I did that and then I'm
just using a fudge by Anastasia Beverly
Hills to smudge out the lower lash line
then I'm taking the UH Nastasia ultimate
gulo kit and just using those two first
shades to highlight her inner corners on
my god the best and then I'm also using
that to highlight her cheekbones as well
the lipstick I'm using a Mac well and
for lipliner I used dried cosmetics sure
but it was all out of focus so I didn't
put that clip in so yeah I'm just
applying well by Mac it's seriously like
the best dark nude color ever I love it
so much and it suited this eye makeup
look so perfect I loved it so then I'm
just spraying the face with some Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray and that
is the final look done I hope you guys
enjoyed watching I loved creating this
look I'm obsessed with cut creases now I
really want to do heaps more glam looks
like this so please comment down below
any suggestions and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
