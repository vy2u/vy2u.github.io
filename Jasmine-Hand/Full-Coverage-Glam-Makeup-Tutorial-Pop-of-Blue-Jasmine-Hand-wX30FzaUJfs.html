more than does search but you stay
hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel so I'm going to get straight
into it so first up I just take the
Garnier micellar water and put that on
her face with a cotton pad just to
ensure the face is nice and clean before
priming for primer today I use the
benefit Porefessional this one's the
pore filling one and I just use that
around her nose on her chin and on a
forehead and I just found that these
were the most textured areas on her face
so obviously I want to smooth them out
by using the pore minimizing primer and
then to probably the rest of her face I
took the pore fessional matte rescue gel
primer this is new and I loved it she
has slightly oily skin so I decided to
put this all around the rest of her face
fanfic foundation I'm using the Mac
Studio Fix fluid and c37 and obviously
this is matching her neck not her face
because her face is wider than the rest
of her body because she faked hands um I
got a few comments on my video with
Britney because obviously she also tans
and she doesn't turn her face and
everyone was like oh my god the
foundation doesn't match below blah but
yeah I just wanted to point out that I'm
obviously matching the foundation to her
neck not her face so anyways I'm just
applying that evenly all over her face
with a damp Beauty Blender
you
for concealer I'm using the Maybelline
fit me in the shade light obviously it's
my favorite concealer ever and I'm
placing that underneath her eyes bridge
of her nose Cupid's bow chin and a bit
on her forehead
so to bake her concealer i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder just on
that damp Beauty Blender that we were
using before I've actually tried to
apply the baked with a dry sponge or
wedge and I found that it wasn't as
effective as using a damp Beauty Blender
just because I feel like the products
actually seeps into the skin with a damp
one whereas when I used a dry one it
kind of just sat on top of the skin and
it looks a bit scaly so yeah I just
thought I would let you guys know I've
actually recently been loving setting
the rest of the face with the Laura
Mercier transferred powder instead of my
estrela's fresh and flawless I don't
know I just think it looks flawless and
sometimes when I don't want to add that
extra coverage i use the laura mercier
so yeah I'm really loving this and it
doesn't have flash back which is a plus
so now I'm taking my reborn
blush brush is my favorite brush for
removing the excess powder from the bag
just because I feel like it doesn't
actually remove the concealer underneath
because I know sometimes when I use
brushes it does that I'll leave a link
down below where you can purchase these
brushes from they're so amazing then to
contour I'm using the hauler benefit
bronzer of course and I'm using the
reborn powder 12 brush again this brush
is amazing for contouring so as you can
see I'm just placing that in the hollows
of her cheekbones around her forehead
and on her jaw line
so now to bake a contour i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder again
on a dry makeup wedge you can get these
wedges from like anywhere Woolies Kohl's
Priceline literally any beauty store
would have them and as you can see I'm
just creating two lines just directly
below her contour then for blush I'm
taking max petal power this is an
amazing like shimmery type blush it's
really similar to hot mama actually by
the balm and I'm taking that on the
reborn blush brush and just placing that
on the apples of her cheeks
then taking these small highlighter
brush by reborn I'm using that with the
Mac soft and gentle highlighter I'm
obsessed with his holidays so much I've
like almost hitting pan almost and I'm
about to cry but yeah I'm just lazing
that on her cheekbones Cupid's bow tip
of her nose and just a little bit down
the bridge underneath and below her brow
bone so now I'm brushing off that bake I
left it on for a little bit too long
cause you can see a really harsh line
but I did blend it out but still I only
like to keep it on for about max a
minute because I feel like it's hard to
blend that line and then like your
foundation underneath like kind of moves
I don't know but yeah I don't like to
keep it on for too long so for eyebrows
I'm taking the under Circe Beverly Hills
probe repeller and this is in the shade
taupe and I'm using this on a reborn
eyebrow brush
you
and then taking the fit me concealer
again in light and I'm just using that
on a makeup addictions cosmetics
concealer brush and I'm just using that
to carve her brows and then I'm placing
it on her eyelids to act as a eyelid
primer and I'm just blending that in
with a reborn multi blender 54 brush
and then I'm just setting the eyelids
with some Laura Mercier translucent
powder for eyeshadow today I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills shadow Couture
palette it's one of my ultimate
favorites it's amazing I'm grabbing
Morocco which is a burnt sort of orange
color and I'm just placing that through
her crease and the brush I'm using is
the reborn crease brush
you
and will grow in number
then I'm taking pink champagne just on a
flat shader brush by zoeva and I'm just
placing that on her inner corners of her
eyes
then I'm taking fudge and I'm just using
that on that same crease brush by reborn
and I'm just mainly placing that in the
outer corners of her eyes
for eyeliner in her waterline I'm using
the understudy Beverly Hills ocean
eyeliner and just placing that in her
waterline just with the reborn 82
eyeliner brush and I was so happy with
the result of this I just knew that
putting blue in the waterline would make
her blue eyes pop even more and it did
it looks so amazing
then taking fudge again on a zoeva to
300 a brush I'm just using that to smoke
out her lower lashline
and now I'm highlighting the inner
corners with the reborn point smudge 57
brush i'm just using mac soft and gentle
for this then for top line i'm using the
maybelline eye studio gel pot liner in
black with my reborn 83 eyeliner brush
and just creating a thin line on the top
of her eyes also a hack to get the inner
corner of the eyes with eyeliner you
tell the client to look down and look
the opposite way so that way it's really
really easy to get right in the inner
corner then for mascara I'm using the
pony cosmetics white night mascara just
on a disposable mascara wand of course
and just coating her top and bottom
lashes
then I'm taking the model rock smoky
velvet double layered lashes and oh my
god how did I not know about these
sooner they are so so so incredible I'll
leave a link down below where you can
purchase them from model rock lashes are
my favorite lashes ever I use them on my
clients all the time
then taking that mascara one from before
I'm just using that to blend her real
lashes with the false ones
you
then to line her lips I'm using the
Gerard cosmetics show lipliner I've
already gone through two of these and
one of the nude ones like I'm on my
second one I love these lip liners so
much they're so creamy easy to apply
long-lasting amazing I'll leave a
discount code down below if you're
interested and then for lipstick i'm
also using one of my all-time favorites
which is pho by mac this is really
popular within my clients as well as
well as buttercup by gerard cosmetics
they're both really gorgeous nude pink
colors that suits pretty much every
single person's skin tone and then over
the top I'm just taking my Rimmel oh my
gloss lip gloss and this is just a clear
one
and then to finish off a look I'm just
spraying her face with some mac fix+ and
this is the final look I hope you guys
enjoyed watching and learnt something
new and of course if you recreate one of
my looks please tag me I would love to
see them thank you so much for watching
I love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
