so for today's video I decided to put
all of the makeup that I got to good use
and film a first impressions video and
pretty much is like a full-face first
impressions except for a few products
but if you'd like to see how I created
this like I kind of experimented with
like the little halo cut crease sort of
look that's like training on Instagram
at the moment so if you like to see how
I created this look then just keep on
watching so I don't actually have any
new brow products that I haven't tried
before so I'm just gonna go in with my
usual the benefit cut brow in the shade
number 4 I'm just going to lightly fill
them in this product is so bomb I love
it and they used on my clients as well
then I'm just taking it some concealer
this one's just the Rimmel one we're
more breathable concealer on a concealer
brush and just using that to define the
brows feel like it's been so long since
I actually sat down and filmed for you
guys I've been traveling like a crazy
woman these past few months but I'm
finally back home and I don't think I
will be troubling anytime soon I'm
thinking of going to Thailand media so
if you guys have any suggestions on
where to stay in Thailand then do let me
know and then it's gonna grab my back
concealer and just put that all over my
eyelid just for a base and blend in all
that concealer just gonna quickly set
the eyelids just with my Rimmel stay
matte powder is it all the time just so
it doesn't crease
to set the brows I'm taking the benefit
3d brow tones and just popping that
through the brows to set them in place I
love this stuff
okay so I've zoomed you guys all the way
up for eyes holy shit looks so crazy but
I've been meaning to try out the new
Anastasi at Beverly Hills soft Blair a
palette holy crap look how amazing these
shades look so first color I'm gonna
pick up will be but orange just going to
use that in the crease I've used this
color before like I'm pretty sure I have
this color in her single eyeshadows and
I love it so I'm just going to use that
as a transition first up now I'm going
to take Sienna which is right next to it
which is just a deeper sort of version
of it a little bit more coppery and kind
of placing that in the same areas just
to deepen up the color just to make it a
little bit more pigmented
pretty much popping this like all over
Mars what I really want to try out is
one of those half cut creases but like
in the middle they've kind of put like a
strip of like gold or silver so I made
you that depends how creative I get I
might grab a smaller sort of defining
brush and I'm gonna take the shade
mulberry which looks like this and
focusing that mainly on my crease so I'm
just gonna really work that product into
the crease
I've seen this type of I look on
Instagram but I've never actually
watched a tutorial so I don't know if
I'm like doing it right but we'll see
how it turns out I'm gonna take a little
bit of the black I'm kind of scared
it's called noir just a little pinch of
it and using that in the face as well
so just tiniest bit of black okay so now
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to grab
mulberry I'm going to put that on the
outers and inner corners of the eyes try
not to bring that color actually in your
inner corner because that's where I find
some people go wrong with doing this
halo sort of I look if you bring black
like in your inner corner it's just
gonna look like I don't know messy and
like you got punched so you're going to
want to keep it literally on your eyelid
trying not to go any further than your
tear duct area because it does not look
cute
all right I'm gonna take some more
concealer on a concealer brush mainly
going to be focusing the concealer on
the middle of the eyelid so okay so far
so good
and in that with the eyeshadow
so far I'm thinking I'm doing alright
then I'm gonna grab I'm gonna grab this
like rose pink color so I'm gonna grab
this color in the middle oh my god that
is so pretty
ah wow that is so gorgeous then I'm
gonna grab this mecha max the Illuminati
Gold Rush cream shadow and what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna pop that on the
crease line
so I'm going to try out the new mellow
precision pen liner hold my breath and
hope for the best
holy shit this liner sorry easy-to-use
went for a bit of a bowl to kinda wing
today I'm really liking it so from a
scar I'm gonna use the new bad gal bang
by benefit I just thought when they did
that whole mole dives event release that
it's just gonna be just another mascara
and they were just happy that they
bought another one out little did I know
this is honestly the best mascara ever
used like I'm not even just saying that
because of the whole hype of the product
like honestly they apparently spent four
years to make this and honestly
congratulate them because so far the
best mascara ever used like honestly I
do still have a few extensions on so if
you see a few like stray lashes and
that's why but oh my god like so good I
can't believe it I feel like I can
almost get away with this I look with
that falsies but I'm so extra so I'm
just gonna put falsies on so I recently
received these zanotti Beauty lashes
poppin the lashes on
love the difference lashes make okay so
for primer I actually received this
massive box from Bobby Brown I'm gonna
use one of their new foundations so for
primer I'm just gonna use the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched face base it just
came with one of the pr's and I've used
it before but honestly I can't even
remember if I liked it or not so I'm
just gonna massage that in oh that's not
so good okay so I think I have the right
shade warm natural 4.5 just popping that
on mmm oh girl that is full coverage
okay I'm putting quite a fit okay I'm
putting quite a bit on I don't even know
it just formula feel like that formula
is a tad sticky I don't know that's me
or if there's like glue on here or
something but it's like very like I can
hear it bouncing on my Beauty Blender
it's very sticky formula so weird it is
definitely more of a Joey finish not
matte which in my case because I do have
a little bit of textured skin like it
does bring out my bumps and stuff but
obviously after I put powder on it'll
look a lot different but so far it does
actually look really beautiful in this
again not gonna lie so I do actually
have a new concealer to try out it is
the mecca Mac's brand is their life
proof concealer in the shade ivory I
have a feeling that this may be a little
bit too light but oh that's right
something I can work with
so just popping that under my eyes here
here here and yeah and then blending it
in with a Beauty Blender oh holy shit
this actually has good coverage what the
hell make a max if you guys don't
already know it is a pretty affordable
brand in Mecca that's really nice and
it's blending really easy like it's not
thick so they also came out with a
lifeproof super set invisible pressed
powder which is white and I'm scared
yeah I'm super impressed with that
like seriously what so flush let me go
try and find one that I haven't used so
the flash I'm gonna take the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills blush kit in the shade
radiant we're gonna use a little bit and
just pop it on my cheeks just to add a
bit of color I'm not usually a blush fan
so I don't add a lot so if a highlighter
I'm gonna take the new I'm rezzy
Anastasi bubbly hills collaboration
honestly the most stunning highlighter
I've ever used the formula pigmentation
the color everything about it I am
actually obsessed I've already like
create a little dent in it I cannot deal
icing on my Cupid's bow tip bridge I'm
gonna also pop this on my inner corners
so I'm just gonna grab like a little
brush like what the hell okay
I'm gonna finish my level lash line I'm
going to go in with burnt orange again
which is the first transition color we
used on the top take that underneath
first
that I'm taking a Sienna again and
running that underneath as well
then finally I'm going to take mulberry
which is this color I might take this
palette into work this afternoon and use
it on my clients
so I have actually recently been really
liking using dark brown and my
waterlines as opposed to black just
because it is less harsh so I am going
to use the makeup geek full spectrum
eyeliner pencil in the shade
expresso this isn't new or anything but
I don't have any new like brown liner so
I'm just gonna use this one I'm just
gonna pop that in my waterline I'm gonna
grab a little fine defining brush I'm
gonna take the shade Cypress unbar I'm
just gonna literally put that into my
lower lashes just to sort of soften the
look of the waterline just so it looks a
bit smoky so like in comparison you can
see so really pressing that into the
lower lashes like that I'm just gonna
pop some of the bad gal bang mascara on
the tops and the bottoms just to blend
in my eye lashes and to add to the
bottom oops hey we're on the home
stretch guys so for lips I'm gonna take
the new mellow cosmetics Harper lip
liner formula of these are really really
similar to my favorites from Gerard
cosmetics so I'm gonna lie my lips and
I'm just like obsessed with the color
holy shit there's so creamy
full lipstick I'm gonna go in with the
Anasazi Beverly Hills new liquid
lipstick in the shade Hudson oh my god
this shade looks amazing Oh dead dead
dead dead ur dead urdead oh my god Wow I
do have a new setting spray it is by Too
Faced it's called the festival refresh
setting and refreshing spray so this is
the final look I'm so happy about how it
turned out I love that like halo cut
crease sort of I look I'll definitely be
doing heaps more tutorials with similar
like sort of styles in my next videos to
come but thank you guys so much for
