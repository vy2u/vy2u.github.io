channel so today's video is inspired by
nikkietutorials full face only using
kids makeup challenge but not everything
I used was classified as kids makeup but
I did find most of the stuff in like the
kids Beauty section and came up so I
picked up a bunch of stuff some of them
were just complete disasters and some of
them I actually really liked especially
for the price of only three dollars so
yeah if you would like to see how I
created this full glam using only kids
makeup then keep on watching so the
first thing I picked up was this massive
cage and it was only $15 I actually
really liked it because I thought I'd
use the case after this video because
it's like a nice clear case oh my god
this brush just feels so rough how can
they do that to innocent young people
like what what is this brush that
actually kind of hurts by the way no
offence if you actually use any of this
makeup like I'm sure some of you like
you know use this brand or use like
makeup from these packs just because I
know people don't always have a budget
for makeup I'm just having a little bit
of fun with this and kind of going out
of my comfort zone and trying really
cheap makeup for fun so I just thought
I'll quickly mention that this is
actually a really cool case if you guys
like a needing a really clear makeup
case for some reason or doesn't have to
be for makeup then $15 and then you get
makeup okay so I did pick up an actual
kids makeup set from it came out this
was $15 this is what it looks like hold
on if I can it's like all really
plasticky so that's like the first layer
that's the second layer and then the
third layer actually looks really cute
but um yeah I'll definitely be using
like the brushes that it comes with will
attempt to use the brushes that it comes
with it also comes with like lipstick
nail polish and yeah bunch of eyeshadows
and stuff and also before
so I just want to say this video was
inspired by nikkietutorials I'm pretty
sure she was the first person that did
this if I'm not correct me if I'm wrong
but I saw her do it and I was like oh my
god that looked like so much fun and I
was literally in hysterics the whole
time so I was like I need to film this
video unfortunately I only have a few
brushes that came with the kits that I
bought so I'll probably just be using
some of my normal brushes but I'll try
my hardest to use the brushes that came
with everything that I bought the brand
I was talking about before is called
love and someone snapchatted me that
works that came out and said these
aren't actually kids cosmetics they're
just like sponsored by Kmart or whatever
like they're stocked at only Kmart
so this is what the packaging it looks
like so this is like a pressed powder
this is a eyes shadow and they have a
foundation mascara this is actually by
EXO which is like two dollars like all
of this love stuff for three dollars
each and this was two dollars at mascara
I'm actually really nervous to film this
but it's all about having fun so I don't
really care what I look like I'm still
gonna upload it first I'm gonna go in
with a primer this a color corrector
skin primer by love and it's for
brightening and glow that's what it says
you actually get quite a bit of product
in here for something that's three
dollars you get 38 grams so that's what
it looks like okay I'm going to squirt
some of the back of my hand it's kind of
like a salmony color
Oh God doesn't really smell that nice
just kind of giving me that glow though
now I'm going to go in with our
foundation this is the flawless
foundation in the shade medium they only
had three shades light/medium or dark
and the dark looked too dark and the
light looked too light so oh no no see
how it goes this looks so pink base oh I
may have to just mix a little bit of my
yellow base foundation that's what it
looks like but we'll see how it goes
okay this foundation is literally orange
okay
I can't really see any coverage yet but
that's right we'll build it up it's just
not blending it all it's really thick
and it's definitely the wrong color I
feel like it'd be cheating if I added
like a different foundation in so I'm
just going to label like this who cares
this is literally the streakiest and
grossest foundation I've ever tried in
my life okay I'm going to go get my
Beauty Blender and see if that is going
to help this situation if you like this
foundation is just like not doing
anything for my skin this is so sticky
I wonder what like is in this foundation
how could someone like produce a
foundation like this I guess if it is
like kids makeup or like you know makeup
for you know younger people that don't
wear it properly then I guess it's
alright because it's like they're going
to go out of the house or if they do but
it's going to look less worse on a child
than like a fully grown adult like
myself this foundation is so jewy I feel
like the color looks a bit better but
the whole like foundation in general is
just not good would not recommend so if
a pressed powder I'm just going to use
their loved one again this in the shade
medium like I don't know if you guys can
see but it's kind of like the undertone
is like salmon it's so weird I do not
have a good feeling about this
that just took my foundation off Oh Mike
it just looks like I applied a blush
that's how cemani it is so this brush
was like genuinely hurting my face so
I'm just going to go in with the normal
powder brush even though this was like
the complete wrong color and just Pat
that all over I just felt my face and it
still feels wet so I obviously didn't
put enough on what the hell it's not
setting okay this bronzer application is
going to be messy I can just tell
so the bronzer that I'm going to use is
by the brand B indulge and it came in
that metal case not gonna lie though the
color doesn't look too bad I'm going to
attempt to use it with the brush that I
think is supposed to be is for
contouring
that actually doesn't look too bad okay
let's dip some more in
I'm gonna bronze my forehead this brush
is absolutely horrendous but I'm working
with it I'm just going to run some a
forehead area but I just add it a bit
much okay so there's actually quite nice
it's doesn't have a shade I'm going to
use it on the same brush and place that
on the apples okay that didn't work well
it's actually glowy
it's actually not too bad then this love
brand had a face shimmer which is pretty
much like a highlight which I was really
surprised they had because it's really
hard to find an affordable highlighter
let alone one that's only three dollars
and this one looks incredible okay I'm
just going to use this with like one of
my reborn brushes so I'm just gonna like
swirl everything in there doesn't look
like anything's coming off the brush
okay here we go
um come through what the
dead black honestly looks stunning in
real life obviously I applied way too
much but I got a bit excited but if you
weren't light handed with this oh my god
that is gorgeous
I just realized I've completely forgot
to use this bad boy so I'm thinking
about amping up my blush a bit I'm going
to use the blush brush that came with it
and I'm going to use this like corally
pink one okay that's just like not like
coming off oh wait yeah it is is that
even coming off oh god what did I do
this palette actually kind of has a nice
transition kind of shade it looks like
this and it looks exactly like Peach
Smoothie but it has a bit of shimmer to
it so I think I want to go in with that
in my crease and use this amazing
blending brush that it came with nothing
is coming off all right I'm gonna go in
with just one of my normal fluffy
brushes cuz those brushes and not
working and it's just not you're not
even going to be able to see anything
it's not too bad and I grabbed this
brush and it's got like that sponge
applicator and I'm gonna drench it in
that gold um not much on my finger now
that looks a little better
we're going to grab some of this white
and put it in my inner corners cuz you
know how much I love a nice bright inner
corner highlight oh not bad it's
actually really pigmented this while a
each other okay I'm going to go in with
this little palette that came in the
clear makeup case and take this color
reduction doesn't look too bad to be
honest I'm just going to use that in the
outer corner mmm this isn't too bad
no it didn't
oh my god what the I wanted to try
this pie pot it's silver I would have
placed it in the inner corners of my eye
that's wrong I just really want to see
if this is pigmented I was gonna take
the sponge applicator thingy I'm
scooping it up oh all right okay doesn't
look too bad on the back of my hand
oh my god what is happening to me
usually pretty good when it comes to
liner this is the love felt tip liner in
black oh dear God alright let's give it
a go it's not too bad the liner tip
isn't flexible at all it's like stiff so
that's what's making it hard but the
actual like pigmentation of it is not
too bad does it be indulged mascara not
really doing much not too bad though
let's just hope it doesn't make me go
blind I actually bought the EXO mascara
that I actually really want to try so
I'm going to open that up there's almost
only two dollars this is the mascara
same sort of one which is a bit shorter
this one's definitely a lot more easier
to use so I'm going to go in with this
palette and I'm going to take this pink
lipstick okay you can't really see it I
might go in with one of that things from
the pan so I'll probably go this one it
looks really pretty I have actually
quite nice I don't know where my
tweezers are so this could be tragic
these are the ACE lashes in the style
winged lady and then to finish off the
look I'm going to go in with the love
makeup mess I'm guessing this is a
setting spray or something feels like so
steamed eyes no no no no no no that
actually stung so this is the final
makeup look to be honest I thought it
would turn out way worse than it did
like it is still pretty bad but some of
the products weren't actually too bad
for the price yeah one thing I don't
want to offend anyone if you guys use
these products like by all means if they
work for you if you like them
use them obviously not everyone has a
budget for makeup so I understand if
you're like you know using 3/4 I don't
know under $10 makeup products like
that's what I used to use when I was
starting out I never had any high-end
makeup
I only just bought from Priceline when
they had sales preferably the 50% off
sales I always used to go through the
bins in Priceline always get like the to
$3 stuff because I just could not afford
the full price stuff once again thanks
