channel so for today's video I am once
again teaming up with a Rimmel London
Australia to do this festival inspired
makeup look
false first of all in Byron Bay which I
am attending is coming up very soon and
Rimmel London is actually their makeup
sponsor for the event so I thought I
would do this Christmassy a festival
type glam makeup tutorial so if you'd
like to see how I created this look
using all of your more London's products
then just keep on watching I'm starting
off with the Rimmel London stay matte
and mattifying primer just because I do
have oily as skin so it just helps to
keep my face nice and matte throughout
the day then for foundation I'm taking
the new long-lasting finish breathable
foundation I'm just mixing the darkest
true colors together just to match my
tan so I'm just putting it on with the
stick and then just blending it all in
with a damp Beauty Blender
then taking the Rimmel London lasting
finish breathable concealer in the shade
200 so I'm just putting that underneath
my eyes down the bridge of my nose
Cupid's bow and chin and then blending
it out with the same Beauty Blender as
well then I'm taking one of my favorite
powders the Rimmel stay matte
translucent and just popping that
underneath my eyes to set my concealer
and then I use a larger brush and just
use that to set the rest of my
foundation as well
to fill in my brows I'm using the Rimmel
London born this way at brow kit I'm
just using the little brush that it came
with and just lightly filling in at my
brows
then ting some more of the breathable
concealer and just using that on a
concealer brush and using that to define
the brow so I'm just popping that
directly underneath just to make them a
little bit more defined then just taking
some more room we'll stay matte
translucent powder and just using that
to set my eyelids then I'm going in with
the Rimmel natural bronzer and just
using that to bronze up my face
now I'm taking this blush also from
rimmel and just using that on my cheeks
I'll leave a lisp down below of
everything that I use so it's easy for
you guys to find if you're interested
then taking the Rimmel good to glow
liquid illuminator and just placing that
on the highest points of my face so on
my cheekbones Cupid's bow and down the
bridge of my nose so I should say I'm
using the new magnifier eyes color
palette so I'm using the nude one first
I'm just taking this light brown shade
and just using that as a transition
color using a windscreen wiper motions
on a big fluffy brush just in my crease
and just slowly building up the color
then taking the breathable concealer
again on a concealer brush I'm just
using that to create a little soft cut
crease so as you can see I'm just
literally cutting my crease then I'm
placing this gorgeous rose gold color on
my lids just using the applicator that
it came with just because I feel like
this deposits most of the product with
the sponge so I'm just popping that all
over then I'm just using the darkest
Brown from the palette just true to find
my outer corners then taking the white
liquid liner and just using that to
define the cut crease
then I'm just placing some lash glue on
the lid because I'm going to pop on some
loose glitter so this is just kind of
like a coppery type glitter and I'm just
packing that all over the lid then I'm
taking that emerald green from the color
palette and I'm just using that to smoke
out my lower lash line
phone rings I'm taking the remote wonder
wing eyeliner and obviously creating a
wing
and now I'm just popping on some false
lashes and then grabbing some more glue
and just putting a silver type glitter
in my inner corners just to really
highlight that and then I've also taken
that silver glitter on my cheekbones as
well then Phillips I'm taking the Rimmel
stay matte liquid lipstick in the shade
of firestarter and popping that on then
I'm taking their new lip art glosses and
oh my god they are incredible as you can
see from my reaction and just popping
that straight over top then to finish
off I'm just setting my face with the
insta-fix and go setting spray and that
is the final look done I hope you guys

visit us in the Rimmel London tent and I
will see you guys in my next video bye
