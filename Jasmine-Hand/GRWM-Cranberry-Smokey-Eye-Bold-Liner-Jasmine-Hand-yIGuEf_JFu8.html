this feels so weird to be sitting down
and talking to you guys in my new
apartment in my new little filming space
I've been so busy these past few weeks I
haven't got many videos off of myself
but finally everything is starting to
get into place and I'm going to go back
into filming regularly again so I'm so
excited so for for this video I'm gonna
be like a little chit-chatting get ready
with me type video I did a makeup book
on Instagram a few days ago now and
there's like a cranberry sort of smoky I
was like a really nude lip so I thought
I recreate that for you guys I hope is
not too much of an echo because I don't
have all of my furniture at the moment
I'm still waiting on a few more things
so hopefully it's not true echoey so
first I'm going to do brows I'm just
going to use my benefit cut brow in the
shade number three on my prenta
cosmetics brush so strange to be filming
in a different area but definitely
something I can get used to because I'm
so obsessed I knew how oh my god I can't
wait to show you guys in a vlog once I
have everything I'll do a vlog I'm just
going in with some concealer of course
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
just a concealer brush this one is the
XO Beauty eyeshadow brush it's their a
new collection I'm obsessed with them so
good I'm just using that to carve out my
brows I might for the eyeshadows you
guys up so you can see what I'm doing a
bit far away then I'm just going to
blend all that out
and then just with the left over
concealer just put it on my eyelid to
prime so just taking at the benefit 3d
brow chose in the shade number four and
running that through my brows to sex
them all right I'm going to zoom you
back up so you guys can see a little bit
better and clear up so whoa it's a bit
too zoomed not that fun so I recently
got this
I love the right as it's arrived Sarah I
don't know collab with collar pops oh
God pronouncing this is her she's so
pretty and I want her live badly so this
was her collapses of lip product I show
oh my god pretty like purpley times and
that one and then this one is oh my god
dead like brown colors definitely my
fila cause I'm definitely going to use
those today so this one is a ultra lot
sorry
pretty oh my god yeah she nailed it all
that nice - I got one
okay so these two and that because it's
it's in this one a lot okay I'm going to
take this shade called freckles which
looks like this so Freddy and I'm going
to use that in the cruise all these are
really pigmented actually I'm just sort
of putting that in my crease and upper
crease area I love this eyeshadow
so I'm going to take this color which is
called nosh and put that in the outer
corner I'm using the XO Beauty firm
blender brush so I can pack the product
on first and then we go in with a
blending brush and blend it out okay I'm
going to make it a bit darker so I'm
just going to go a bit more product I'm
like really really really impressively
by photos like wow it's so easy to blend
now I'm going to take this shade right
here which is called a vivacious and
it's a metallic finish so excited to put
it on my list
oh my god
holy it looks like lit off
because I'm going to do a cramp around
the bottom I thought it would look cool
if I use this fireball over 2k lineup
and just to create like a little sort of
live where my crease is so I'm just
going to look straight ahead and kind of
just like
excuse it about there can you guys say
that
because for light I'm just going to take
the Maybelline eye studio on my Imus RZR
liner brush I know don't have a name
start off at the tail
great dot and just going from the top
and just like driving that down
I'm kind of feeling like a Snoopy line
up so I'm going to grab some more of the
dark brown color and just kind of like
use that on top of the liner I'm just
going to make it smoky on the first half
and I'll leave the wing walk in the shop
so now we're going to pop on some
mascara
I'm just using the lights camera lashes
from tar
but I'm going to take some of my
favorite styles right now they're called
the nasty Beauty lashes that's what the
packaging looks like on the other one
so the primer I'm going to try at the
Sephora based smoothing primer and pop
up all over this prize a similar
consistency to the model co one that
they used to always use the foundation
I'm going to use the Stila stay all day
in the shade 8 I've seen this so
obsessed with this foundation I've
pretty much been using it every time I
go out or do a full phase I just think
it looks flawless
I love it I love the color as well so a
little bit here just double check that
all match me I'm going to use the EXO
Beauty flat face brush to blend it in
yeah I think that is a good latch kind
of got this it's going to dot this all
over right and then just blending that
all in
down to it concerns if I believe the
true face born this way concealer in the
shade light and cover up those bags keep
its load on my chin put up the forehead
and then done to my nose and then just
blending that all in with if you wonder
as well
and then set the concealer on just a
tape thief laura mercier translucent
powder and pop that underneath my eyes
then it's a something difference that
the rest of my face I'm just going to
take the band mineral sand stone powder
foundation and use that to set the rest
of my day so so we're not using my
stroller but I'm going to change things
up a bit then if you Franz that I faking
and hit the Bobbi Brown bronzing powder
in the shade golden light it's not that
light but it works really well with my
skin tone
he's going to take that on the exo
Beauty bronzer brush and put it on my
cheek area and then around the forehead
and of course down the sides of the nose
underneath the lip and along with your
life too
so I want to use a pinky sort of
eyeshadow for the bottom something that
would look really cool so I'm going to
take the kylie burgundy color and take
it in middle shade that one right there
I'm sleeve that on a Urban Decay iconic
eyeshadow brush and the literally well
run it underneath my lash line I like to
bring it out all the way till underneath
the wing just so it like connects nicely
so I'm just really like driving that
like athletes so just to define the
lower lash a little bit more I'm just
going to take this flat brush just with
some more of a dark brown color just to
kind of define it as I said before and
I'm going to blend it out with that
burgundy shade this will also make the
eyes appear larger because I'm not
actually adding black into the waterline
I'm adding it below you want to make
them look even bigger then I put like a
nude or a white on the waterline but my
eyes are fairly like big as they are I'm
going to take a clean brush with this
shade again from the colour-pop palette
and use that in my inner corner then I'm
just going to add some more mascara to
the lower lashes
I'm going to take this true face
sweetheart
bronzer one of my favorites and use that
as well actually on my wife office but
first before I forget just from
underneath that eye and placing that on
the cheeks around forehead
and to further content it's going to
take the hoola by benefit what's new
just on the same brush and just going to
use that to chisel out the cheekbone
down just taking some more translucent
powder on my Beauty Blender and running
that underneath
now I'm taking at the knob sexual
content for la filling that around this
is so pretty and glowy and coconut on my
cheeks okay so for highlighter I got
sent this Urban Decay jean-michele back
quite so bad pronouncing things ha ha
what yo diz really use this shade as a
palette for highlighting today my
Anastacio brush pack it on okay that is
really really nice Wow
love and then on my keep it sir
sounds like Goldie I love it my easily
visible as the palette to just on my
cheek
Wow a lot on it something to you the
Garrard cognitive hold up after
sharpened it Melrose Place lipliner this
is one of their new one super pretty
time the man lower lip
I'm not usually into really pale nude
shades but ever since I tried the Melo
cosmetics one in the shade Ivy's are
then I love it so I'm gonna put that on
and I kinda like to blend it with the
liner underneath so it looks on braids
