I feel like it's been so long since I've
sat down and filmed a video but I'm back
for today's video I've done this beachy
glue though we type makeup tutorial so
if you'd like to see how I created this
look then just keep on watching
alright so because I'm not gonna go
really heavy with the eyes I may as well
just start off with the base but usually
if I was to do like a glam makeup look
old something eyes first just because of
the fallout and everything like that but
nothing crazy on the eyes today so I'm
gonna go in with the face I'm going to
start off with the new pearl primer
Porefessional by benefit and then we see
this other day actually so I've been
really keen to try it out I'm just gonna
squirt a little on the back of my hand I
love the original professional I think
this Prime is supposed to be sort of
illuminating which is amazing because
I'm going for that glowy look today so
ever since I did that video with room
all my last video I'm pretty sure I try
to have that breathable long-lasting
foundation and this has literally become
one of my Holy Grails like I wear this
pretty much every time I wear makeup I
even wore it out on my birthday that's
how much I loved it it says that it's a
medium coverage but I swear to god it is
like the fullest coverage of a
foundation that I have like I sometimes
mix it with my George or my honey just
to get that like the exact shade but
this shade is pretty spot-on for my tan
I don't have that tan on at the moment
it's just all natural so I like the
shade of 400 and natural beige it's
gonna mix it up a little bit I've
literally like already used half of it
so much I like it alright so I'm just
going to pop that everywhere
I like the applicator so it makes it
really easy to use then I'm just going
to take a Beauty Blender and one doing
that for the foundation don't forget to
blend it down the neck by the way if for
those wondering like I've gotten so many
questions like oh my God where have you
been because obviously I haven't
uploaded on YouTube in about three weeks
cause I've been holidaying and I just
come back from I don't know if you could
call it holidays I just spending time
with my boy fee it was in Perth so yeah
he came to visit me over the New Year's
break and yeah he just kind of left
yesterday and I'm getting stuck back
into filming again I haven't been doing
clients this whole year because he's
been here visiting so yeah I'm getting
back into it I'm going to visit him in
Perth in February only for two weeks
though but I'll make sure I pre film and
stuff so I'll always have videos going
up from now on but it was kind of good
to have a little break from everything
like even off to Bali like I was really
really busy and then it was good off to
Bali to just chill out again as I was
asking how I met Peter I met him when I
went to Europe I minimum I could take
you to her actually and yeah we just
stayed in contact ever since and yeah
things kind of escalated a bit I might
save all about a juicy gossip for
another video I do like a Q&amp;amp;A or
something if you guys want to know more
so I just think that coverage like a
special effect everyday or even going
out is perfect it's not too much but
it's not like no coverage I can't do the
whole light to medium coverage
foundation
may as well not wear anything I just
don't feel like it looks good on my skin
so I just like full coverage all the
time all right so that's the foundation
on corner few more I'm just going to use
my NARS radiant creamy concealer in the
shade custard love this concealer and
just put it underneath my eyes I can do
anything like dramatic like I'm not
gonna do a whole highlighting and
contouring cuz that is not what this
makeup look is about today I was going
to blend that in again it's concealer
it's got really good coverage I love it
it takes a bit to blend out because it's
sorry full coverage but once you blended
it out into the foundation it looks so
good
we're not gonna bake or anything like
that I'm just gonna use some of my Laura
Mercier and powder just on a brush like
this and just Pat that underneath just
to mainly set it so it doesn't crease
okay I just went really Orange just then
let's go set my eyelids as well normally
I'm not going to use a powder or
anything just because I know I kind of
want my face to look glowy so I don't
really want to mask that with powder so
I'm going to go on with eyebrows brows
I'm just going to use the benefit cover
out in the shade number four and just
lightly filling in the brows nothing
truthful one
okay so I'm going to use a bit of
benefits Sunbeam
I'm really trying this out pocket before
but I'm just going to put this on my
cheekbones I'm not really a fan of using
like liquid holidays I don't know they
scare me for some reason
well okay chin up here a blood two out
and a stack but before I do that I'm
just going to put some on my collar
bones as well in a mirror for this I
just use this like paddle brush thing to
blend it in
I could use this brush for this too I'm
just going to blend that all in
yeah oh my god that looks so good so two
bronze I'm going to go in with Mac give
me Sun or looks like this it is a tan
orange but I make it work somehow I'm
just gonna pop that on my cheekbone it's
just too little not my face not going to
do any contrary or anything like that
cause who can be bothered to contour
your face when you're going to the beach
honestly not saying this look is
specifically designed to wear to the
beach because let's be real no always
make up to each other anyways I'm just
gonna put some underneath my live and
then along my jawline as well so I just
went through all of my makeup and I
picked up something that I haven't used
in forever but I remember I used to love
when I first got it it is the hourglass
ambient lighting palette oh my god it is
just so beautiful I'm gonna use the
middle shade and maybe a little bit of
the and shade and use that to go over my
heart oh my god
wine I stopped using it it is so nice
okay other side well
all the success okay Keith
so if I shall I actually receive the new
morphine 24g grand-slam grains glam
color in that tennis anyways I'm in the
mail the other day and oh my God look
how massive these pans are I'm gonna get
another morphe palette and just show you
the difference because it is crazy so I
can't find my other morphe palette I
think they're in the cellar but just for
like comparison imagine if they were
circles like that's how much bigger the
pears are in this palette it kind of
look like I don't know it's like a
contouring kit like that something's out
anyways it's going with Frankie show
what that looks like
which is just yeah looks a little bit
more orange than it does on camera and
I'm just gonna use that in my crease
actually I'm pretty much just gonna pop
that everywhere usually what I would do
like if I was in a big rush I wish these
bronze up because bronzes do you have
like a yellowy but not a yellowy an
orangey tinge to them I just literally
just pop up my crepes and I'm good to go
but I'll just use these because I
haven't used them before so it is
literally just going in my crease and on
my whole lid I'm going to use the one
next to it just to give it a little bit
more definition it's called mojo looks
like this it's just a it's just like a
darker version of the color that I just
use and I'm just going to use that in my
crease to Nek minnit just turns out to
be like brown smokey eye glammed up I
didn't control myself I'm gonna run that
same shape just underneath the lash line
to just to balance it out I'm obsessed
with like orangey brown colors so obsess
then what I'm going to use is one of my
favorite in a corner highlight it is the
Australia's metallics eyeshadow in the
shade gardens and the rose petals that's
what it looks like I get really a bit of
a closer that's what the back looks like
but this is seriously like my favorite
thing to pop my inner corner and the
other side a bit much on as I'm gonna
take this palette again and I'm gonna
take the shade glazed which looks like
this
yes I'm using a sponge applicator tip
lazy live and popping that over top
that's so pretty
then let's go pawns in the fire this is
the CIA London one two one two the SCARA
I love this I'm gonna buy the full size
next time I go into Sephora so good it's
so similar to the true faced better than
sex so I think it's a bit better
I do have eyelash extensions on by the
way and they need in fillings
so don't mind that I think I want to put
a few like faux freckles on while okay
I'm going to try this true face
chocolate brownie brow pencil for the
faux freckles
so to finish off for the lips I've
recently been loving this comics
moisture plus lip balm it comes in like
a clear version a pink version and I
think like a peachy version but I've
been obsessed with this pink one for
some reason I really like it so I'm
gonna pop that on there so moisturizing
but it gives you like a little bit of
color so you don't look like too playing
but it's just like a little subtle like
hint of pink I like it and then to
finish off I'm gonna go in with the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist so this
is the final look I hope you guys

day or night wherever you are and I'll
