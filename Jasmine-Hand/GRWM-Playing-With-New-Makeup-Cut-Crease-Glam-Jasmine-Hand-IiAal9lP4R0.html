in today's video I thought I would just
sit down have a little chit chat and try
out some new makeup that I've recently
been sent through PR packages and
whatever so yeah I just thought I would
play around with makeup I didn't really
feel like doing a specific look in
general or I just really didn't know
what video to film so I thought why not
just try out a bunch of new makeup I've
got so much set out in front of me
so I'm just gonna pretty much just pick
whatever catches my eye at the time so
I'm just gonna tie my hair back it's
really cold here on the Gold Coast like
the weather is sorry bipolar lately like
yesterday it was storming like there's
no tomorrow and now it's like clear to
blue skies and it's hot but then it's
cold in my house so weird I've upset
this foolproof brow powder that I've
never seen before maybe it's new you
until they have the same formula or
never but it's just a little compact
powder and then the powder is in this
shape of an eyebrow what I'm going to do
is just really lightly fill in the
sparse areas of my grass for those of
you that already know my eyebrows are
tinted on so I don't really need to do
much to them I recently just got them
framed in tinted so literally were ready
to go 24/7 at the moment which I am
loving so I can see like I haven't yet
tried is a new Bobbi Brown instant full
cover concealer I have two shades I've
got patience and I think sans a bit
darker so I might use beige today no one
is taking a concealer brush wow it's
really really thick and then just using
that to carve the brows out it's kind of
hard to tell if you like a concealer
while you're using it like this so let
you know when I use on
my eyes if I can run up okay I'm gonna
put a little bit more concealer on I'm
just gonna take the leftovers that was
on my arm and just put it over my eyelid
it's really really sticky like really
thick like compared to the fit me I'll
leave you guys up
I do the eyes then I'm just going to use
some Rimmel stay matte translucent
powder just to set the eyelids just for
the eyeshadow kind of blends a bit
easier okay I'm gonna move you guys up
look so bad so that I should I'm going
to go in with the new morphe 35o true
palette
they've completely changed their logo
and like packaging and it is so very
much better than the original packaging
I know to me it kind of seemed cheap
like it looked cheap and it looked I
don't know it just looked a bit tacky to
me but now they've changed a logo it
looks like even though it's like basic
it's so much better I think then either
change the packaging of the actual like
like the case because it does feel like
a flimsy and like it's gonna break but
anyways these are the shades you know
which just look a little bit more
vibrant than the old 35 oh and it's
actually got names on this little thing
to be honest I find that pretty useless
anyways because I end up losing it so I
just get the names of them okay so I'm
going to take the reddest of the reddest
car I'm not sure if they've changed
their formula or like the pigment of
these so we shall find that out now as
well I guess
okay very pigmented just going to use
that in the crease pretty
I'm going to bring it all the way to the
inner corner because I'm gonna do a
little cup crease so I used fire in the
crease now I'm going to use the shade
hate which is more of like a dock burnt
orange you gonna come up and I'm going
to use this to deepen up the outer
corners then I'm taking the shade just
so many colors choose from chestnut
which looks like that colors I'm
gonna take the black which is called Wiz
see how pigmented this really is and
it'll literally just use that in the
outer corners oh my god this blocks
amazing yeah this is blending out really
nicely I'm just gonna take a blending
brush and just blend all those colors
together all right I'm gonna cut the
crease now so the key to cutting a
crease is not to go true above your
natural crease oh that's my not to
crease there I kind of want to make that
up here a bit bigger so I'm just gonna
cut it just above it follow my natural
eye shape so once you get it out half
way
I'm just gonna take a brush and like
blend in that concealer to the iphoto
these kinds of eye looks are so much
easier than they look I've been I'm off
to shave and the palette it's called
peel off and it's just like a pure I
pretty much gold color my god yes this
color is amazing so this is the trick to
getting that perfect line so I'm just
getting a makeup wipe putting it around
my finger and it does help that I do
have fake nails I can get that real
crisp line so it literally all I do is I
just get the fall out from underneath
first and
to be honest I haven't gotten any new
liquid liners but I just had this one in
my drawer and I don't think I've used it
or if I have it hasn't been for a while
it's the NYC liquid liner I know
krispy uses this for her wings all the
time and she always raves about how good
it is mascara or potion of zoom you guys
now I'm gonna try this I quote skinny
length mascara I know this is a new but
I haven't really used it I have noticed
that the island does go a little bit
crumbly after it dries maybe because
it's cheap I don't know
whenever want some fake lashes I think
I'm just going to use the Koko lashes in
the style queen bee I've used them so
many times so anyone to show you what
they look like because they're probably
ratchet okay so now that I feel somewhat
human again with eyelashes I'm going to
go on with base so I have heaps of new
products to try out so excited so I'm
going to go in with the new makeup
cosmetic our multi-purpose plumping balm
and it says that you can use this as a
primer just pump a few pumps on the back
of my hand it's not so good working that
into the skin a foundation that I've
been pretty much wearing every single
time I do a makeup or want a full
coverage look is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk now for some reason my
skin hasn't been as oily as usual maybe
it's because I've been getting heaps of
microdermabrasion skin treatments and
that's kind of drying up my face but I
find that this foundation at the moment
works really really well on my skin type
at the moment so I've got the shade at
6.25 and I actually got this matched for
me Wiles when your because being the
dumb person I
I didn't really bring any darker
foundations even though I knew I was
gonna 10 miles overseas only just bought
like two foundation shades and they were
what I was at that time and just pop
that all over I am fake tan that's why
I'm using this color
I can see a lot I'll use the Bobby Brown
once again just to see how they feel
underneath my eyes it's very thick like
very thick and it kind of feels oily as
well I feel like this is the type of
concealer you use just to cover
blemishes like on your face
not so much to brighten conceal and
highlight underneath the eyes but I
could be wrong after I blend it out and
just taking the really wonder and
blending it out okay it is floating out
really nicely because I said it was oily
before it is like blending out easy it
isn't looking matte like while I blend
it out as opposed to the top one I feel
like that's really really drying okay so
I suppose I'm gonna have to set that now
and I have it recently fallen in love
with the new Too Faced translucent
powder it's really really good thank God
I found another area I can use in my
videos because I feel like I'm always
using the laura mercier one taking it on
at the blender and pop it under my eyes
it's really finely milled like the Laura
Mercier one and yeah I've had no
problems with it since I've been using
it because I don't have any you pressed
powders I know I need to go on the hunt
and like I've you've researched some
good ones so I can try them out for you
guys I'm just gonna go ahead with my
trusty estrela's fresh and flawless
she's that but I like to use a lot of it
just because my face does get a bit more
drier but I just kind of go over it it
doesn't have much part in the brush just
to go over everything just to make sure
it's all set I'm gonna go in with tan
which looks like this so using that on
my lower lash line but I might use a
little bit of fire which is the right
that we use in the crease as well just
to kind of like tie in the look
then I'm going to take a dark brown for
the one right next to the black on a
naruse or a brush and I'm going to use
that right below the lash line so I
really wanted it to be dramatic on the
lower lash line but I don't want to put
black and blue and stuff on that
sometimes that's what makes my eyes look
like they're a bit smaller than what
they are I'm going to take that gold
again and pop it in my inner corners
that is so pretty
so I have a new Smashbox palette it's
called the contour blush and highlight
palette so I haven't taken it out of
packaging yet that's what the inside
looks like
so I think I'm going to use their
contour but I'm thinking I need a
bronzer so I don't really have a new
bronzer to try out so I'm just gonna go
in with the Marc Jacobs one warm up my
face and now I'm gonna go in with this
middle shade right here
and there's a really nice color oh my
god
I feel like I didn't even do much just
then and I can't all look snap
okay I really like this around the
forehead might as well go in with the
blush I really like the look of this one
it's a peachy sort of Cara Lee color so
I'm just gonna use that that is really
pretty
I'm just going to take the the Too Faced
translucent powder then if a highlighter
I'm gonna take the new glow kit by
Anastasia Beverly Hills it's the sugar
one and holy look out three of
these colors look I'm gonna go in with
gumdrop which is a Goldy color is not
that is absolutely stunning
like can you guys see that it's like
almost true reflective it's like it's so
pretty
so I figure I'm going to put some
mascara on my bottom lashes then take
away with this fake oh my god now
probably the most hardest decision is
lip color as this one here and it's
called just what I needed and it's a
Powermat little pigment like the
packaging just looks so sleek and it's
just like looks like the most perfect
and I think I want to try it on and I'll
zoom you guys up so you guys can see the
pigment of it to what I might just use
this Saul that Blahniks I feel like it's
kind of along the same sort of color
scheme
so now I'm going to go in with the NARS
power matte lip pigment in the shade
just what I needed
oh my god it is so pigmented i feel like
i need a little bit of gloss on the lips
so i'm gonna go in with the melted latex
high shine gloss i've used this a couple
of times it's cold girl on top it's just
clear and then to set my face i'm gonna
go in with the new at gerard cosmetics
play all day oh my god that smells
amazing it smells like rose but that is
the final look I'm actually really happy
with how the eyes turned out and mostly
products that I tried today I really
really like which is pretty rare for me
considering you guys know I'd love to
stick to the products that I use all the
time and yeah I literally never swap up
products but I'm really loving how these
products are looking on my skin so yeah
