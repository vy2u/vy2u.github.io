sorry it's been so long since I've
filmed myself but I'm getting straight
into this tutorial first up I'm using
the Benefit Cosmetics Cabrillo in the
shade than before and I'm just using
that to fill in my brows
then I'm taking the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade custard just on a
concealer brush and just using that true
to find the brows so just popping that
above and below and then I'm also just
placing the excess on the lid just to
act as an eyelid primer
then taking the benefit cosmetics Ready
Set brow clear brow gel and just running
that through my brows to set them in
place I love this stuff I use it on my
clients it literally just locks your
brows in place all day and they don't
move then I'm going in with the Rimmel
stay matte translucent powder and just
using that true it's set to my eyelids
for eyeshadow then I'm going in with the
huda beauty smokey obsessions palette
and taking that top middle transition
color and just using that in my crease
then I'm taking this Naz palette I'm
unsure of the name but I'll even list
down below I've been so obsessed with it
recently so I'm taking that matte brown
transition color and just going over the
same spots so just basically putting it
in my crease as well
then I'm taking the bottom left matte
brown shade and basically putting this
all over my lid and just blending it all
the way out
then to make it even darker I'm taking
this brown from the NARS palette and
just putting it over top
then I'm just getting a makeup wipe and
removing all the excess eyeshadow that
fell on my cheek and kind of cleaning up
the edges I'm going in with a mellow
precision eyeliner and just creating a
bold wing
but I'm taking me to face glitter pop
peel-off Lana and to be honest the whole
peel off thing didn't really work for me
maybe I didn't put like a thick enough
layer on but I tried to peel it off and
it just peeled off the whole liner so I
just left it on
for mascara I'm taking the benefit
BADgal bang mascara and just popping
them on my top lashes and then for fake
lashes i'm using the huda beauty
Samantha and just using some jewel ash
glue to pop them on there moving onto
base I'm taking the benefit
Porefessional and just popping that all
over my face and that is my primer and
then I'm just going to spritz my face
with a bit of the Too Faced hangover 3
in one spray for foundation I'm using
one of my new phase which is by mecha
max it's their life proof foundation in
the shade sand I've been using this a
lot recently I just love how it looks on
my skin and it's just a really nice
color match to my skin color so I'm just
blending that in with a damp Beauty
Blender by the way guys I've gotten
heaps of questions asking what 10 I use
I actually haven't faked an all year
like I just go out in the Sun every now
and again so my tan is natural then I'm
going in with the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in custard just underneath my
eyes to conceal and highlight and then
just blending it all out and then true
set the concealer I'm taking at my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and using
that to bake underneath my eyes but I'm
not using the sponge I'm just using a
brush just to lightly bake actually not
really baking I guess I'm just like
setting it then I'm taking the Australis
fresh and flawless face powder in the
shade medium tan and setting the rest of
my face and I'm taking the UH Nastasia
bronzer in the shade rosewood it's like
my go-to bronzer at the moment I love it
and using that to bronze up my face and
that was Facebook
but I'm taking the powder again and just
using that to bake underneath my contour
just with my sponge then I'm going in
with this Naz cheek palette I caught
them in the name but I'll leave it
listed down below and I'm just going in
with the blush and just placing that on
my cheeks then going in with my favorite
highlighter which is the amrezy and
Anastasio collab and popping that on the
highest points of my face so cheekbones
Cupid's bow on the brow bone and a
little bit above as well
I'm just wiping away the excess powder
from underneath my contour bake then
going in with the NARS palette again and
taking that same transition color and
just using that to smoke out my lower
lash line I pretty sure I just used both
Browns here as well
and then I'm taking this brick sort of
ready color and also smoking that in my
lower lashline then I'm taking the
Australis metallics cream eyeshadow and
just using that to highlight my inner
corners and then I'm just taking that
same benefit mascara just to coat my
lower lashes then I'm taking this mellow
cosmetics lip liner in the shade Ruby
and lining on my lips
and I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte
liquid lipstick in the shade for starter
I'm obsessed with this liquid lipstick I
love the formula of these so I'm just
applying that
and then just setting my face with the
two phase three and one hangover spray
and that is the final look I hope you
