today's video is just going to be a
chilled out voiceover type get ready
with me I actually wasn't planning on
putting this to youtube I was just
filming this for like little short
Instagram videos just to see like how it
turned out and I actually really liked
the way it turned out so I decided to
upload it on here because I've been a
little bit slack lately on the YouTube
so yeah if you like what you see then
just keep on watching so first up I'm
just spraying my face with the new
Gerard cosmetics lay all day finishing
spray you can actually spray it before
foundation as well as after foundation
and I actually really really like it and
then for primer I'm using my Nivea post
shave balm and then for foundation I'm
using the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless in 220 and I've got to say that
this is hands-down my favorite drugstore
foundation at the moment I remember
using it a few months ago and I don't
know why I hated it maybe the color was
off or something but I just didn't like
how it looked on my skin maybe because I
had a little bit more acne back then but
now that my skin's cleared up I think it
looks absolutely flawless on my skin so
yeah I really really like this
foundation now and all I'm doing is
buffing it in with a damp Beauty Blender
so the concealer of course I'm using the
Maybelline fit me in the lightest shade
and as you can see I'm just popping a
generous amount underneath the eyes a
little bit on my forehead down the
bridge of my nose Cupid's bow and a bit
on my chin and then I'm grabbing the new
benefit Joo the hoola like liquid
bronzer and holy it's literally
exactly like hoola but in a liquid form
I'm not really usually a fan of liquid
like contouring and bronzing products
but this is so beautiful on the skin it
blends out super easy
it doesn't like look patchy or muddy or
anything like that which is amazing
because most liquid or cream contour
products that I've tried just just don't
sit well on my face for some reason even
when I try not other people it still
doesn't work I don't know maybe I just
don't know how to do it but this is
seriously the best liquid bronze I've
ever used in my life as you can see when
I blend it out it just blends so
seamlessly with it also looking really
natural
so to set to my under-eye area I'm using
the face of Australia translucent powder
and I'm just packing that on the damp
Beauty Blender to a baked Marc face yes
I like to use the face of Australia one
as well as the laura mercier one just
whatever tickles my fancy on the day
they're both really really good transits
and powders and then to set the rest of
my face of course I'm using the
Australia's fresh and flawless face
powder in darkest Brown and then after
30 seconds or so I'm just wiping off
that excess translucent powder from the
baked and then to bronze up my cheeks
I'm using the hauler benefit powder
bronzer with the brush that's very new
at the moment I think it's out already
you can get it from Sephora my online
it's actually a really really amazing
bronzer brush that was the first time I
ever used it and I've been using it ever
since so yeah it's a really good brush
if you're looking for a nice contouring
brush
those witches leading us and love is all
will ever trust ya know I don't always
would
you
so if a browser decided to go a bit on
the bolder side today so I'm using the
uh Nastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade
in the shade chocolate and I'm just
using that on my favorite eyebrow brush
by pony cosmetics and as you can see I'm
filling in my brows
you
so now I'm just sculpting out my brows
with the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the lightest shade again I'm just using
that on a synthetic concealer brush
around these walls to create a song and
then to set my brows I'm using the
rimmel born this way clear brow gel and
then for blush I'm using my very first
Mac blush purchase which was the Mac
well-dressed it's just a really pale
pink blush that I haven't really wanted
to wear but I just decided to whip it
out because I haven't worn in ages and I
actually really really like how it
turned out
and then for highlight I'm using the
dried cosmetics
Marylin star powder sprayed a bit of my
brush with the sly old days finishing
spray and then applying the highlighter
and holy this highlighter is life
and then I'm going in with the Too Faced
chocolate bonbons palette which is
relatively new and I'm going in with
that shape which is like a cool brown
just in my crease as a transition color
to see the horizon
we'll go
and then taking the pale pink shade from
the palette I'm just using that on the
same blending brush and just applying
that all over the lid and then I'm just
using that gray type color just to blend
out the crease a little bit more
then taking the dark burgundy shade and
I'm just placing that on the outer V's
of my eyes I'm using a zoeva it's
actually the dupe for the Mac - one
seven brush I'll leave it listed down
below it's like one of my fave brushes
but yeah I'm just concentrating that and
packing the most product on the outer
B's and then I'm just blending that out
with the first blending brush that I use
that is from makeup addiction cosmetics
I leave the brushes listed down below
and then taking that shimmery color up
the top and I'm using that to highlight
my inner corners and my brow bone
so now I'm placing some million I studio
gel liner in black in my tight line and
in my waterline and yeah that's what I'm
doing
and then going in with the palette again
I'm taking that darker burgundy shade
and I'm just using that to smoke out the
lower lash line
you
and then for the scar I'm using the
essence I love extreme which is my
favorite mascara as you probably already
know I use it in like every single
tutorial of mine and then for lashes I'm
using the new Danny Mansouri iSpy lashes
in the style flirt I really love the
style of these lashes but you have to be
really careful when you take them out of
the packaging because they're really
really thin and delicate so I actually
ripped the end of one of the lashes off
with my tweezers because I was a bit
rough with them but that's how I usually
am with lashes and yet it like kind of
fell apart but yeah
just be really careful I really do like
these lashes though they look amazing on
I actually lost the footage of me
putting my lipstick on but I'm wearing
posh by Melo cosmetics so yeah I hope
