so if a primer I'm going in with the
essence all about Matt I'm pretty sure
this is discontinued I'm not a hundred
percent sure though so don't hold me to
it I didn't realize how matte it's
actually dried so I had to spray my
brush with a little bit I don't rush my
face with a bit of setting spray just so
the foundation went on a lot smoothly
i'm using the l'oreal true match I can't
remember the shade but I'll leave it
listed down below and it was a really
good match my 10 was kind of fading so I
found it kind of hard to find a
drugstore foundation that matched and
I'm so glad that this one did because it
is definitely one of my favorites I used
to use this every single day when I was
on uni placement it would not budge it
would not get boilie actually would get
oily a little bit around my nose but it
had amazing coverage and I just really
loved the foundation and I'm just
buffing that in with a kabuki brush
then going in with both the master
conceal and fit me concealer by
Maybelline I decided to go in with the
other one because this one wasn't light
enough to brighten up my under eyes it's
in the shade light so I use that first
blended it out and then went in with the
light shade in the master conceal just
to highlight the area and then blending
it all in
then going in with the face of Australia
translucent powder this is a really
great alternative to the laura mercier
one I love it I always bake my contour
with it I'm instead of the Laura Mercier
one I just find that the finish of the
Laura Mercier one's a lot silkier but if
you're on a budget then I put a hundred
percent recommend this one because it's
also really good then to set the rest of
my face of course using Australis fresh
and flawless and I'm using the shade
natural because yeah I'm not that Ted
I'm just dabbing that all over my face
then taking the Ardell medium brow cream
and just using that true filling my
brows it's really similar to the a BH
dip brow I really love the color and I
went for like a bold dish kind of brow
today I don't usually go as heavy-handed
on my brows but because this is kind of
like costuming type Halloween makeup I
decided to go all-out and bold and I
actually really like this product as
well really easy to use and yeah I'm
just filling in my brows
then just taking some Maybelline fit me
concealer just on a concealer brush and
just using that to define the brow so
I'm just going directly underneath and
above
and then just using some of the leftover
concealer to primer eyelids and just
blending out all of those harsh
concealer lines as well and then to set
the brows in place I'm using the Loreal
brow artist plumper I think this is in
the shade of brunette and just running
that through at my brows for bronzer I'm
whipping out an old favorite the essence
Sun Club in the shade true sunny this
used to be my go-to bronzer when I
didn't have much makeup and didn't have
enough like money for makeup I'm not
sure if it is still available but I'm
sure essence has a bronzer out now and
it's probably the same formula essence
is so cheap I'm pretty sure that this
was like six dollars so yeah really
really good bronze up for the price so
I'm just using an angled brush to bronze
up my face then I'm taking the NYX blush
in the shade tap don't even ask me why
this blush it's says it's a blush
nikkietutorials apparently really loves
this product for contouring so I decided
to give it a go and it's not too bad
it's just really gray and I'm not really
into gray kind of contour products even
though hoola is slightly gray it just
doesn't come off as gray as this but if
you're looking for like an affordable
contouring product then I guess like it
does the job like it contoured my face
really well and then I'm going in with
the face of Australia translucent powder
again just on a damp Beauty Blender and
just defining the contour
then going in with this L'Oreal Paris
blush in the shade 145 and I was really
like surprisingly impressed with this I
really loved the color
I wasn't tree pigmented it didn't look
too much it was like nice and glowy I
really liked it and I've had it in my
drawer years so yeah really liked that
then I'm going in with the sleek
highlighting palette I finally finally
got it and oh my god Jaclyn hill was not
lying this is intense as like look
at that my face was like holy is so
good I'm just using like a really like
large like eye fluffy brush to highlight
because I couldn't find my highlighting
brush but yeah so it's so amazing if
you're into the whole intense highlight
style has just got an email but I'm just
placing that on the highest points of my
face so cheekbones Cupid's bow the tip
of my nose and then a little bit on the
bridge
for eyeshadow I'm using the new NYX
these are called the rocker chic palette
and I'm not sure what shade this palette
is but obviously I'll leave it listed
down below I'm taking the gorgeous like
the sort of coppery transition shade
like every single color out of this
palette is so wearable and amazing I
just find that sometimes when you're
trying to look for like a drugstore
eyeshadow palette like there's some
colors they just like what the like why
are they in there but I swear like all
of these colors are amazing and I love
how there's matte and shimmery colors as
well so I'm just grabbing that color on
a large blending brush and just buffing
that in to my crease then taking the
shimmery gold type color and I'm using
that in the inner corners and as you can
see by my face I was like what the hell
this is actually like pigmented like I
didn't even wet the brush or anything so
yeah I'm just placing that on the inner
corners of my eyes then going in with
the whiter shimmery color and using that
to highlight my inner corners and wow I
really really love this I love an
intense inner corner highlight so I was
living for this color living for this
palette actually it's so good
then taking the dark-brown out of the
pallet and using that on a I'm pretty
sure this is a Mac two one seven and I'm
just blending that in the outer corners
only and trying to make it as dark and
smoky as possible
and then I'm just also taking that dark
brown color and just blending it onto my
lower lash line
then I'm just wiping away the excess
powder from the bake
underneath my contour just with a large
powder brush then for eyeliner I'm
taking the Rimmel precision micro liner
I use this in one of my recent videos
and have fallen in love with it it's so
good I'm using that to just line my
lashline and then I go ahead to create a
wing
so I was gonna do like a little inner
corner type like cat eye effect but I've
done it before and I like look to myself
and I was like whoa why did I just do
that I just did not suit it at all so I
like decide to bring the eyeliner
straight into my inner corner and like
attempted to do like the littlest
littlest bit but yeah it didn't really
like like you couldn't really see it so
yeah I don't know I just don't think it
suits me personally then taking the
Maylene eye studio gel liner and just
using that to line my waterline oh my
god I need to turn my email
notifications off
then I'm just taking that dark brown
shade from the NYX palette again I'm
just using that to smoke out my lower
lash line
then taking the Rimmel mascara and just
using that to coat my top and bottom
lashes
then four lashes I'm taking the Ardell
glamour wispies and just applying them
with some tweezers and the glue I used
was the duo lash glue then I'm just
going over the lash band with the same
Rimmel liner just to hide the glue and
yeah just make everything nice and black
then I went over it with some mascara as
well just to intensify the lashes so now
for the fun part I'm taking the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and I
wish I didn't because it definitely
transfers like especially when I put it
on my lips so I would 100% recommend
using like a paint or even like a liquid
lipstick if you have a black one instead
of using a gel liner because yeah I
probably wouldn't on the actual day of
Halloween cuz I've got a party but yeah
I wouldn't use gel liner so I'm just
creating the little leopard nose yeah
you can do it however you want but this
is just how I decided to do it I think
these next couple of steps are pretty
self-explanatory just exactly what I'm
doing just creating a line from the
middle from the nose down to reach the
top lip again you can make it as thin or
as thick as you want and yeah I just
wish I used a black liquid lipstick for
this because it transferred to my bottom
lip and it was just a disaster well not
really because I just washed it off
after I did this video but yeah a
hundred percent use even like a lipstick
or even maybe like an eyeliner and just
not gel liquid liner then I'm just
taking a nude lipstick this is the
Rimmel Kate Moss one in the shade 55 and
as you can see just applying that onto
my bottom lip so for the leopard print
what I did first was just go ahead and
use the brown from the palette and I
kind of just like created shadows I
don't even know why I did this to be
honest I probably should have like
watched a video on how to do it but I
was a little bit jet winging it like I
wanted it to be really simple for like
beginners to like be able to do because
it was so so easy
I know the prints didn't look exactly
like they should but I just wanted to
kind of make it like I don't know like
abstract like really simple and like
easy to achieve then going in with the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner again
probably should have used like I don't
know a pencil or something but oh well
and then I'm just creating like the
leopard print just using like two half
circles and connecting them together
well not connecting them but like just
doing it like that I don't know I I
literally like probably should have
watched a video like honestly but I kind
of like how it turned out it didn't look
exactly like everyone else's so yeah so
then I'm just taking some craft glue it
was $2.00 from stacks and firstly I'm
just going in with a glitter glue I did
use a two-faced one I'm not sure if I
like know of any drugstore glitter glues
but you could use lash glue as well and
then I'm just pretty much just placing
that glitter in the center of each print
then I'm taking the Desio contacts in
the shade innocent white and oh my god I
so failed to put these on I had to add a
few clips of me legit failing but I
ended up getting them in this clip I
think they're so cool though and really
comfortable to wear so that's the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
and I gave you some inspiration for some
last-minute Halloween ideas if you
decide to recreate it then tag me on
Instagram I love to see it and I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
