so in today's video I have done this cut
crease look oh my god so so happy with
how it turned out even though the knot
is even as I wanted them to be I think
this is one of my best and favorite cut
creases I've ever done so if you would
like to see how I created this look then
keep on watching
so first up for primer I'm going to use
the Too Faced hangover primer I've been
using this a lot recently and I've
really been liking it if you like it
dries really matte so I feel like I have
to put a setting spray over the top
because I foundation doesn't go on as
nice if I just put it straight over this
primer and I'm just going to explain a
face with a Smashbox photo finish primer
water the foundation I'm gonna try out
the Anastasi of Beverly Hills stick
foundations that I got sent to me
generously by her the shade that I'm
gonna use today to match my neck is
going to be warm tans is one I use when
I first tried it out and I found that it
works best blending it with a kabuki
brush first and then going ahead with
the Beauty Blender so I'm gonna do a few
streaks on my face then going in with my
zoeva onenote roots silk finish brush
and it just blending the foundation in
it has awesome coverage by the way
now I'm just going in with a damp Beauty
Blender just to blend it all in
then for brows I'm going in with the UH
Nastasia dip brow in medium tan and just
really lightly kind of filling them in
because I've gotten them tattooed I feel
like I don't need to fill them in as
much so all I do is just define the
edges mainly the tail and I don't really
do much to the beginning I just kind of
like feather it like that
than just taking some concealer on a
concealer brush and just using that to
define the brows then taking the benefit
3d brow tones which i think is just a
gel and just setting them in place for
concealer today I'm gonna try out the
new at top well I don't know if it's new
but new to me because I only just
received it tight shape tape contour
concealer can we just talk about how
like huge this is like the doe foot
applicator is like as big as my nail
it's huge
okay so I'm gonna place this underneath
my eyes to highlight oh my god this
literally has so much coverage already
and I haven't even blended it placing
that on my eyelids as well to prime them
my chin Cupid's bow going up here down
the bridge and then around my nostril
area then taking a beauty blender and
blending that out oh my god this
concealer has really full coverage so I
really want to try and use the UH
Nastasia like foundation sticks as like
cream contouring I'm gonna use the shade
fauna says it's full like contour I'm
pretty certain that it's the same shade
as the powder form
I'm just not usually a fan of cream
contour just because I feel like I'm
gonna set the face anyways after this
because I have to because I have oily
skin and then I bronze and let powder
contour anyway so I feel like it's just
a waste of time doing this but I'm gonna
give it a go so oh my god that is so
gray oh my god okay let's do like it's
like really grey okay I'm just gonna
leave that for now when I try and blend
it out with my
Foundation brah I'm really scared okay
it's not as bad as I thought that's
actually really nice Wow it blends
really really easily on top of the
foundation holy oh my god that
actually worked I'm just like baffled
right now cuz every time I do that it
just looks so bad like I just feel like
every time I tried a cream contour I
just have to take it off because yeah
that doesn't look half bad so now I'm
just gonna set the rest of my face with
the estrela's fresh and flawless in the
shade darkest Brown see what I mean like
I'm just setting that and I feel like
it's just gonna like disappear I get why
people do it like if you have dry skin
you don't need to set your face then I
guess cream contouring would be good
because obviously the less powder you
put on a dry face the better almost
forgot to set my concealer oh my god
okay so I'm gonna use the Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just placing that
underneath
I'm just taking some of that powder to
set to my eyeballs so now for the
exciting bit of the video so I've kind
of based this video around the two-faced
power of makeup palette created by
nikkietutorials I've already used this
plenty of times I actually have a client
tutorial on this with Jade if you want
to check it out I'll leave it linked
down below but I love this palette
although when I first opened it I didn't
expect the transition color that she was
like raving about to be cool toned like
it's kind of like a gray sort of brown
color kind of just expected like a creme
brulee type shade guessing because she's
so fair that this color works best on
her and I actually do really like it
when I first try dolls up oh this is not
my type of transition shade but it
actually does look really really nice
once you put it on so I thought I would
just talk a little bit about the palette
and her pack that it comes with just
while I'm baking so it comes out in
mecha stores in Australia on September
27th actually let me just quickly double
check that in case I'm wrong yes
September 27th at all mecha stores
australia-wide unsure of the price but
I'll leave it listed down below I'll try
and find out for you guys but I'm pretty
sure it's something like 54 US dollars
so that's like something around 7075
Australian if I'm wrong I'll definitely
leave it listed down below and I think
that this pack is amazing I'm so excited
to start using it so it comes with
obviously the palette and it comes with
nine eyes shadows true blushes a bronzer
and a highlighter which is actually a
color in the chocolate bar palette which
I love it's called champagne truffle so
that's what the palette looks like it's
super cool tone as I said before which
is cool I don't really have that many
cool tone palette so in her pack it also
comes with a two-faced sketch marker
which is one of my favorite felt tip
liners ever it's so easy to use it's
really similar to the pony cosmetics
Pegasus one but this one's a little
thinner so it gives you a little more
precision also comes with a mini Too
Faced better than sex mascara but this
one is purple not black so I'm pretty
sure
or this is like a limited-edition color
you can't get the purple one in
full-size only if you purchase the pack
I love the idea of this I probably
wouldn't wear it on my top lashes I
would definitely use it on the bottom
I'll definitely try to use it today if
it suits the makeup look so this is what
it looks like and lastly you get the
most gorgeous silver glitter I've ever
seen in my life
it's called literally I think I'm gonna
use this all over the lid I really wanna
do a cut crease so now that I'm finished
baking I'm just going to wipe off the
excess so the bronzer today I'm gonna go
in with the palette and I'm gonna take
chocolate Soleil I've actually really
been loving this bronzer I'm just gonna
place that in the hollows and bringing
it up and then the other side
going to bronze my forehead as well and
then I'm gonna go down to my jaw so I'm
gonna contour my nose I've actually been
like into it lately just really lightly
I'm just gonna take some more of the
chocolate Soleil bronze up taking it on
a sigma 3d HD precision brush I know
this is not supposed to be for powder
products but it like contours you nose
really well when I was with Brittany she
was contouring her noted this and she
was like this is the best nose
contouring brush and it actually is so
if you're watching Britt thanks for the
tip because it's a really good rush to
bake my face I'm actually using the face
of Australia translucent powder but
because I deposited my CMA no color
powder into it I kind of put it in here
until it's run out because I don't have
anywhere else to put it
so actually I need a mirror for this I
was fully about to do that without a
mirror okay I'm just gonna place that
underneath I probably should've wore a
black top but oh well you can get these
on wedges from anywhere really like
cosmetics pass movers Priceline any
drugstore they're really cheap as well
and I don't use them Deb I've had a few
questions asking I just using dry
actually you know I'm gonna try and do
I'm gonna place this on like the sides
of my nose was apparently that's what
makes it look smaller as well but I
haven't really tried it while that's
baking and I'm looking like MJ I'm gonna
go in with the palette again and I'm
gonna take a mixture of both of the
blushes or in the shades I will always
love you and justify my love puff it on
the cheeks okay I feel like I really
need to this off because it's
really annoy me I don't even do anything
I think it kind of did my nose look
snatched up I feel like I need to add a
little bit more bronzer to the sides
though nose contour amateur over here oh
my god you guys I lost the footage of
the first step of the eye makeup look
I'm so bummed because I really really
enjoyed the like end result of this look
and the video itself so I hope you guys
don't mind but all you missed was just
me creating that cut crease line so I
just used the shade makeup and chill
from the palette which is the warm Brown
like the darker brown color and all I
did was just created that cut crease
line and then now I'm up to carving it
out with concealer okay I think that's a
good height now because when I'm fully
opened you can see the new crease okay
we do the same on the other side now so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
grab a brush and I'm going to set that
concealer just so it doesn't budge I'm
just gonna take ivy which is the light
color and I go in with makeup and chill
again which is the brown and what I'm
going to do is I'm just gonna go over
the line we just made before just to
define it a little more I'm gonna go in
with like a smaller blending brush this
is the eye shadow brush by reborn again
and just blending that out again
also it really quickly I forgot that the
pack actually includes a true face eyes
shadow insurance company feel about that
so I'm gonna use that today for the
glitter to stick on because I just
realized my glitter glue is actually in
the salon so I hope this is gonna work
gonna go in with the eye shadow
insurance just dab it on I guess you
could have used the eye shadow insurance
to cut the crease as well actually so
now that's on I'm gonna go in with the
glitter oh my god I'm so excited so so
pretty okay now for the wing I'm gonna
take the sketch marker which comes in
the pack as well and I'm gonna do I
think I'm gonna do a pretty dramatic
wing so I'm gonna start off by lining
the top
the SCARA I'm gonna use the Too Faced
better than sex so good best mascara
ever placing that on I didn't want the
lashes to be too long otherwise that'll
just kind of defeat the purpose of the
cut crease but I still wanted them to be
like quite dramatic I found that these
were perfect alright so I'm really
feeling the purple shade in this palette
so I think I'm gonna use that on my
lower lash line so it's called wham bam
that's what it looks like when you use
that on my lower lash line I'm gonna add
some mascara the black line always get
it on my cheek
I'm gonna go in with a highlight shade a
bit more just because I feel like I just
took it off and who doesn't love round
to highlight I'm so dead first I'm gonna
line my lips with saw lip liner by Mac
okay now going in with Stella oh my god
yes that is so me but always wear these
kind of colors so obsessed
that is seriously sorry stunning now I'm
gonna go over the top with the milkshake
gloss I hope this isn't too pigmented
because I can't I just want my car oh
yeah by the way when you wear these
alone I freaking sting like oh my god
I'm the biggest
I feel like I'm donek I'm gonna zoom out
so to finish up a look I'm going to
spray at my Urban Decay D slick oil
control spray hope you guys enjoyed
