so today is a video I did a cut crease I
have finished so bout it cut creases
ever since I tried like I've tried so
many times to film a cut crease like
legitimately like at least over 5 times
I just haven't put the video up because
it just looks like crap but I actually
spent so much time to perfect it and I
freaking love the way it looks I know my
eyes aren't like the best shape to do a
cut crease on because I have slightly
hooded lids like creases look amazing on
people with more defined like sockets I
think I did a good job considering my
eye shape and everything you should have
seen at my face slash reaction when I
finished this I because I did one eye
off-camera just so I could play around
and I had no idea what I was doing like
what colors I was using what glitter I
was using and after I finished and I
looked at it I was like yes I hope
I don't up the second eye but I did
but I cleaned it up so hopefully it does
look the same
probably cousins first cousins I'm
obsessed with this makeup look so if
you'd like to see how I created it then
keep on watching ok so I thought I would
start off with the eye makeup just
because I'm using glitter and it can get
a bit messy and I'm so glad that I did
because it literally went all down my
cheek so yeah I'm gonna do eyes first
I'm just gonna prime the eyelid with the
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and then I'm just taking my top lip
palette and I'm just taking that color
here you can see I'm just setting
everything so it's way easier to blend
so if I so I'm just gonna take the top
palette again and I'm gonna take force
of nature up one and it's just like
really really similar to creme brulee by
makeup game I'm just using that as a
transition shade and then I'm going to
take the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
artist palette and I'm going to take the
shade aubergine that's how it's
pronounced
just this purpley shade and this is what
I'm going to use to cut my crease I'm
just using a this is like just a winged
liner brush so what you're gonna do
first is have your eyes open and then
just above where your creases make the
line just so when your eyes are open
you're gonna be able to see the cut
crease
I have like semi hooded eyes I don't
have that completely hooded eyes but
people that have really defined creases
um cut creases just look amazing on them
so I'm very jealous of you right now so
I'm just like mapping out the crease I
said once I've mapped out the cut crease
I'm gonna go in with this zoeva luxe
pencil brush I'm just grabbing a bit
more of that aubergine and I'm just like
using that to blend it up you don't have
to be like super neat and tidy like it
doesn't really matter if color falls out
in the bottom because we're gonna clean
it up with the Paint Pot and then I'm
going to grab punch fuchsia which is
this color and just on the same pencil
brush and I'm just going to use that as
well and kind of like above that
hah crease that we just made
I'm just going to grab this BDD Liam
tool seven seven six brush if you saw my
snapchat you would have seen that I
mentioned these they're like so good and
they're so cheap just going to use dusty
rose which is this one I'm just going to
use that to like blend those two colors
together I'm just gonna go in with a
little bit more the punch color I really
want that purple to be that kind of
vibrant blending sure that is done we're
gonna go in again with the soft ochre
paper but if you don't have this any
concealer will do or a white eyeliner
doesn't matter so I'm just gonna take
that just on this really small concealer
brush and this is where I'm going to
carve out the cut crease so I'm gonna
pull my eye like this and
just calling that out
I'm going for this bit you're gonna make
a mess
curved like that and then just feeling
this era cuz I'll be good at going yeah
as well so I'm just gonna go in with
that white shade and I'm just gonna try
and set that area okay so for glitter on
the lid I'm gonna go in with my glitter
injectors if you haven't Instagram you
probably already know that I have them
but I haven't used them even though I've
had them for about three months whoops
so I'm gonna go in with this gold color
down here and use that on the same
concealer brush and I'm just gonna like
press that on the lid I'm just gonna
grab apigenin again which is this dark
purple color just on the same winged
liner brush and I'm just gonna go in and
define the cut crease just a little bit
more and then I'm just gonna grab the
black from the palette which is here and
it's called Col and I think it's quite
black I think it's more like a chocolate
color and I'm just going to use that to
define the cut crease even more then
just using that blending brush and just
blending everything so it looks seamless
so for line I'm going to use the taut
clay paint line up I'm just going to use
that on a bdellium tools seven six true
brush this brush is also really good
essence mascara oh why does it always
happen to me
does anyone else poked themselves daily
with freaking misfire I always do it
you think this I'd do it so often I
wouldn't I pretty much do it every day
and then my I just waters so mine and
the lashes that I'm using there's
another secret so I can't tell you right
now
- good I have to do that seriously
oh my god help help help help help
that's a s I think it's difficult
Foundation I'm afraid of the out
yes I better use my new Mac soft and
gentle highlighter oh my God look how
amazing it is I'm gonna use that on my
favorite brush whoops and it's gonna
spray a bit of this NYX Jewish setting
spray on it so it's intense I feel like
this look needs like an intense
highlighter yes
so lay my life that is amazing
that is probably way too much
highlighter but you can never have way
to my trial at us so I'm going to go
ahead and finish my I so I'm just gonna
use the Maybelline eye studio in the
lower lash line and I'm just going to
apply that in my waterline I was gonna
put white in but I always look like a
drag queen I don't know if that's just
me but I just look so super weird
because I think my eyes are already big
so that just makes me look bigger I'm
not just like I don't know I look a bit
retarded then I'm gonna grab a vagine
out of the artist palette this color and
I'm just gonna use that to smoke out the
bottom lashline
I might actually bring it kind of
neither wing I find that I do way better
in makeup tutorials when I don't know
like what I'm gonna do so I just wing it
and it always turns out to be amazing
 so I'm gonna grab a bit of that
punch for you sure color which is that
and also use that to blend
if the lips I'm going to use the Giraud
cosmetics sure lip liner
then I'm gonna grab strict liquid
lipstick
I love that okay I'm just taking
whimsical by my cupcake and whoa okay
that is some bright highlight so this is
the final look I'm so happy about how it
turned out don't forget to give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it as
well and I'll see you in my next video
