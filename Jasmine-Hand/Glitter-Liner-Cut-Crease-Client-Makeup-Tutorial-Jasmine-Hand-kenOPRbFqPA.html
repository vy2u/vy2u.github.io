so today's video is going to be this cut
crease look and I wasn't actually
planning on uploading this on youtube I
just wanted to do like a little
Institute Oriole but I really really
like how it turned out
so I decided to pop it onto YouTube so
I'm just going to get straight ahead and
get started so for foundation I'm using
the Mac Studio Fix an N c37 and I'm just
blending that all in with a damp Beauty
Blender as always
then taking my favorite concealer the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
I'm just placing that in a triangular
sort of shape underneath her eyes to
conceal and highlight and then I'm also
just placing that down the bridge of her
nose I've been on her forehead Cupid's
bow and on her chin
and then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder I'm just using that
on the same beauty blender and just
baking her concealer
and then of course sitting the rest of
her face with the Australis fresh and
flawless face powder in darkest brown
and then I'm taking the hoola bronzer by
benefit and using that to contour her
nose and her cheekbones and then to bake
a contour I'm using the laura mercier
translucent powder again and I'm just
using that on a angled sponge and then
for blush I'm using hot Muller no I'm
not I'm using Melba by Mac sorry and
just placing that on her cheeks and then
I'm just brushing off the excess baked I
don't like to keep it on for too long
otherwise I find that the line is a bit
too sharp so I only keep it on for like
20 to 30 seconds and then brush it off
so the highlights today I'm using a new
favorite which is the Mac soft and
gentle and I actually wet my brush with
a bit of fix+ before just to intensify
the highlight because I'm a sucker for a
good highlight and then for brows I'm
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
program palette as usual and I'm just
using the shade soft brown just to fill
in these sparse areas of her brows
and then I'm just flicking her brows
even more by carving them with the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the
lightest shade just on a concealer brush
so for eyes I'm grabbing creme Brule by
makeup geek and I'm just using that as a
transition shade and then I just went in
and kind of put it all over a lid
because we were thinking of doing
something really really simple like I
was just thinking about the glitter
liner and we weren't actually gonna do
the cut crease until the end I just
thought it looks a bit plain so that's
why we decided to do the cut crease
later but yeah so I'm just putting that
literally all over the lid and then
through the crease and then just taking
my Maybelline eye studio gel liner I'm
just using that to do a nice flicky wing
and I'm just using that on a sigma yes
sigma winged liner brush
you
boys that carries
we stay too soon to act on it can we
ever be that all depends on what you're
feeling
and then the glitter liner I'm using is
by NYX and it's the lux liquid liner
I'll leave the color down below I'm
pretty sure this is in the shade nude
and I'm literally just doing that
straight above the black line that we
just did and then I'm grabbing the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner again
and I'm just placing that in her
waterline and then I'm just taking
anasazi Beverly Hills single eyeshadow
in hot chocolate I'm just using that to
smoke out her lower lash line
and then I'm just applying some mascara
on her top lashes I'm just using the
benefit they're real
and then for lashes I'm using the model
rock to one tree lashes and I'm using
the duo lash glue I've just actually
recently started using the duo and I
really really like it so yeah I've been
using that very much recently as opposed
to the House of lashes lash glue
so then I decided to do the cut crease
and I'm actually grabbing a brown from
the tartlet palette and as you can see
I'm just kind of placing that in her
crease and then blending it and then
placing more product and then blending
it again just until it's nice and
seamless
and then I'm grabbing the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and as you can see I'm just
kind of carving out the cut crease like
I can't really explain it but I'm kind
of like trying to make the true lines
parallel to the wing does that even make
any sense is parallel even the word I
don't know but you can see what I'm
doing and then the lips I'm actually
using a Laura Mercier lip liner I think
this is my friends because I never
bought this so thanks Erin I now use it
in my kit
I'll leave the color down below it's
actually at work so I don't have it on
me but I'll leave it in the description
box down below and I'm just lining her
lips
and then the lipstick I used is Mac fo
it's like the perfect movi pink color
ever I'm obsessed with it so yeah I'm
just applying that
and then I'm just going over the falsies
with her real lashes with the same
mascara one just to blend everything
nicely together
and then I'm just adding a bit more
highlighter because you know the first
time obviously wasn't enough so yeah I
think this just made the look so this is
the finished makeup look I hope you guys
enjoyed it and learnt something new and
if you did don't forget to give me a
thumbs up and I guess I will see you in
my next video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
