channel so in today's video I'll be
doing at this to make up look on MySpace
I decided to play around a little bit of
color because I haven't really done much
color on my channel recently so I
decided to go for a glittery blue smokey
eyes like a deep plum lip which I think
complements the blues so well so I hope
you guys enjoy watching I'm just going
to get straight ahead and it gets
started I'm just going to go in it was a
primer I'm using the Australis primer
original vibrant news not want to use a
lot of smell that smells so good so
because I've remembered I'm going to do
brows first I'm just going to use me
benefit browsing in the shade and number
four comes with this brush that fits in
and then it like extends out which is
pretty cool because it's really hard to
use like really small brushes I used to
always fill in my brows with powder
until I discovered the dipbrow
so this taking a concealer to carve the
brows is like eyelids are like sweating
God times like these I wish I lived in
like Melbourne or something where it's
like always cool foundation they use the
Stila stay all day at foundation and
concealer I don't actually know the
litters because there's a concealer like
in the lid maybe used it before but I
kind of like how these foundations have
a little scuba thing I guess that would
be good for makeup artists like if
you're using a kit because it's very
hygienic because you just scoop it out I
guess put it on your metal plate and
you're good to go I guess it's the same
as like a pump but I know this is fun
it's really like cool I'm so weird like
that anyways hopefully this is going to
match my Chan I might just put a little
bit on the back of my hand just going to
take a zoeva silk finish brush with a
little bit of that foundation and just
kind of color match it and see I think
it should be a good color because I am
fairly like a yellow base because the
tan that I use is blonde a fan so it is
quite yellow which I like in a Chan
personally we've got a little bit more
on the back of my hand and kind of work
my way up and as you can see but it's
like very yellowy toned
this foundation is very thick and full
coverage which is obviously what I like
oh my god the crickets are out again no
that's so in a way when I'm trying to
film I remember stalling I was like
those crickets are so freaking loud in
your background what sorry and then to
conceal my under eyes I'm going to use
the Urban Decay Naked a waitlist
concealer in the shade light neutral I'm
actually almost out of this I'm going to
have to buy another one because I love
it so I'm just going to use that
underneath my eyes on my forehead a bit
and then I'm going to use it to prime my
eyelids as well then I'm just going to
take my bead blender again and blend it
in
by the way before the concealer creases
I'm just going to take the Laura Mercier
powder the translucent powder sorry and
I'm going to use that to bake the under
eye area and then set the rest of my
face I'm just going to use the Australis
fresh and flawless in darkest brown I
know this is a new product or anything
but I've used it for years and I just
absolutely love it so I'm just going to
use that to set the rest of my face then
I'm going to take Mac give me son one of
my favorite bronzers at the moment for
bronzing up the face well duh obviously
and just using that to warm up my face
just to put some color back in just
using that on an iconic London brush
so weird how you can hate a product and
then start loving it and then it's
become like one of your favorite like
products and then a little bit down my
nose just to warm it up a bit then it
going in with hoola bronzer and just
using that on the same brush as well I'm
just going to use this to contour my
face so just popping that in the hollows
so now I'm just going to take the Beauty
Blender again and going to take some
more of the Laura Mercier powder and
just use that to run directly underneath
the contour
so I assumed you guys up so you guys can
see a little bit closer on the ice so I
think I'm going to use the Kylie
cosmetics holiday palette I received
this a few weeks ago and I still haven't
tried I really want to use like the blue
or the green because I haven't done much
color recently on my channel so I'm
going to go in with disease health names
yes
chestnut which is this color right here
just use that as a transition shade this
is like a dusty sort of pinky moly color
super pretty I love how this palettes
kind of cool toned but don't really have
that many cool tone palette that's why I
bought it but always stick to my warm
tones so as you've got the color up it
kind of goes like kind of purply I guess
which I'm not complaining about like I
really like the color I've just gone and
got my Too Faced bon bons palette and
I'm going to take the shade Bordeaux
which is this color right here and you
got a more tapered brush and really use
that kind of in the crease as well I
guess I think I want to do like a subtle
cut crease that I want blue to be on my
lid I take it the same at Bordeaux shade
and use that underneath as well
I'm literally sweating my makeup off
basically my undereyes are sweating now
I'm going to go in with the blue shade
from the color palette which looks like
this I'm going to spray my brush a
little bit of the sly old day by Gerard
just to make the pigment pop a little
bit more and then I'm just going to go
ahead
in the same blending brush just to blend
that into the crease it's not as
pigmented as I thought it would be I'm
really packing like heaps on the brush
and there is a lot to fallout happening
before I had the glitter on my lid I'm
just going to go in with the darker
shade which is like a really dark ugly
color and I'm going to use that on the
outer corners just to deepen it up a bit
I'm just going to go in with the Urban
Decay it moon dust eyeshadow in the
shade they go never uses before but it's
just I'm guessing it's just like a like
a cream eyeshadow so I'm going to place
that oh yeah very runny actually going
on like quite like patchy and glossy I'm
not sure if that's how they're like made
to apply but like you just saw that I
try to blend it out and it kind of like
disappeared
really gorgeous color though I'm loving
it so if I have one in the shade
chemtrail which is like a beautiful
champagne color oh my god
it is so intense I love it
come put a tiny bit in the center
so I line I'm going to go in with the
hot clay pot liner in black
some in the water line as well
Benten this guy I'm just going to take
the benefit roller lash and just cart my
lashes
senthil acid on taking the flirty lashes
in the style Apple deficit brand with
black and these are what the lashes look
like is so pretty but NEBOSH I'm going
to use the not sexual content dual
intensity blah and planet on my cheek
this is really pretty
well Howard I'm going to use the Laura
Gila do this honey litter like my
favorite holiday at the moment it is
amazing like you'll see what I mean is
sec it is seriously so amazing like look
at that whoa it's a little bit too much
- scissor highlight is seriously like
blinding I love it so I'm not sure why
but in this part of the video my audio
just shut itself so I'm just going to
have to do a little voiceover so for my
lips I use the Anastasia Beverly Hills
lip palette I only use one shade I
didn't actually mix because I really
loved the berry shade just on its own so
what I did first was like my lips with
the bare minerals lip liner I'm caring
what the shade is I'll leave that listed
down below so those are the asking and
my opinions on the palette like I was
really impressed with the formula as you
can see when I put it on I was like wait
what like they're really creamy I did I
don't know I just didn't expect it to be
as good as it was I probably wouldn't
recommend buying the palette if you just
like the average girl but if you're a
makeup artist and I would highly
recommend getting something like this
for your kit just because obviously it
reduces the amount of space when you're
traveling you don't have to carry around
50,000 different lipsticks you can just
carry around this and then a few of your
favorites
so this is the final look I hope you
guys enjoyed watching and if you did

for me and subscribe to my channel for
more videos every week and I'll see you
in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
