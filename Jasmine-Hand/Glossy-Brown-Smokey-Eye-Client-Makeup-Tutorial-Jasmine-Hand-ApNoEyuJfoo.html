so I'm getting straight into it I'm just
going in with the benefit browsing brow
powder in the shade 4 and just lightly
filling in her brows also just wanted to
say so sorry for only uploading one
video last week I've been so busy with
moving houses but I'm finally settled in
so hopefully I should be going back to 2
to 3 videos every week yay so yeah I'm
just doing the other brow now as well
just really lightly I don't want them to
be too dramatic so I'm just taking some
light concealer just for Maybelline fit
me and just using that to prep her
eyelids for eyeshadow and then I just
use some translucent powder to set them
in place
then I'm taking frappe single eyeshadow
by makeup geek and just using that on a
large fluffy brush in the crease and I
just mix it with a little bit of creme
brulee as well then I just took the
fudge eyeshadow by Anastasio Beverly
Hills and I'm just placing that all over
the mobile lid and just blending it out
with that same blending brush
I was a little bit messy with the
eyeshadow so I just went in with some
gone in Mesilla water on a cotton pad
just to clean up underneath the eyes and
then I just did the inner corners as
well later on because I realized I put
way too much dark shadow like near her
nose anyways on the primer I'm using the
Too Faced hangover and just putting that
all over her face and then for
foundation I used the Mac Studio Fix and
NC 35 and just running that first on her
face and then blending it all in with a
damp Beauty Blender
then going in with the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and just
using that to highlight and conceal
underneath her eyes also placing it on
the forehead down the bridge of your
nose Cupid's bow and chin and blending
it all in
that months everything in splendid I'm
taking the iconic illuminating drops and
just placing that in the places where I
would usually highlight so on her
cheekbone area and then Cupid's bow and
tip of her nose then taking the laura
mercier translucent powder and just
packing that underneath her eyes to set
her concealer then going in with frappe
again and i mix it with a little bit of
fudge by Anasazi Beverly Hills just
smoke out the lower lashline and then
for her waterline I'm using the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner in black
then taking a really really thin and
narrow sort of brush I'm taking a matte
black eyeshadow and really pressing that
into the lower lash line so then that
creates that sort of gradient smoky
effect and then going in with a blending
brush underneath it just to blend
everything all out then I'm just wiping
off the excess powder from underneath
her eyes and then I go in to
highlighting I know I'm doing it before
bronzing but I was just too excited so
I'm taking me three to beauty 3d eye
shadow not a shadow highlighter palette
take any first shade and just popping
that on her cheekbones apparently this
is supposed to prep the skin for this
color that I'm about to put on and wow
it actually looked so blinding in real
life it looked amazing so putting that
on her cheekbones and then Cupid's bow
and tip of her nose as well
then going in with bronzer I'm just
taking the benefit who largest on the
brush that it came with and just
sculpting out her cheekbones
but I'm taking it the same palette from
who to be the Ender's take in the blush
shade and just popping that on her
cheeks then just taking the translucent
powder again and just using that to bake
underneath her contour and then just
applying some mascara on her top and
bottom lashes you didn't have extension
so she did let me put a little bit of
mascara on and yeah just putting them on
the bottom as well and then for lipgloss
all I put on was the Marc Jacobs one in
the shade sugar sugar and then I put it
on her eyelids as well I really really
wanted to experiment with different
looks that I haven't done and I know
you're not supposed to put lip gloss on
eyelids I didn't have like proper like
eye gloss I think Mac has it so next
time I'm in the postal I'm definitely
going to have to pick it up because I'm
not sure how lip gloss laughs on the
lids but I really really loved how this
look turned out anyway so I'm just
adding a little bit more highlighted
because you know I can never have too
much highlighter so then I'm just
spraying her face a little bit of the
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and that is the final look done so I
hope you guys enjoyed watching if you
did please don't forget to give me a
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel

you in my next one bye guys
