first I just want to say thank you so
much for 100k here on YouTube I'll have
a giveaway coming soon so first up I
just used the gun in Mesilla water just
to ensure the face is nice and clean
before priming and then the primer I
used was the benefit Porefessional and
then to add some moisture back into her
face I just sprayed the mac fix+
and for foundation I'm using Mac Studio
Fix fluid in NC 37 just drilling that
all over our face and then blending it
all in with a damp Beauty Blender
as I just say
the voice that carries them as camrea
stay too soon to act on it can we ever
be that all the bands are what you
feeling from a show
and then to conceal her under eye area
I'm just using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the lightest shade and as
you can see I'm just placing that
underneath her eyes a little bit on her
forehead down the bridge of her nose
Cupid's bow and then on her chin
then just taking some more of the
Maybelline fit me and using that to
prime her eyelids and just blending it
all out
and then to bake a concealer i'm using
the laura mercier translucent powder
just using that on these same beauty
blender from before and just patting
that underneath her eyes and then to set
the rest of our face I'm using the
Australis fresh and flawless face powder
in darkest brown
and then for brows of course I'm using
the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
Pro brow palette and I use the shade
soft brown which is the top row on the
right and just used my pony cosmetics
eyebrow brush and I'm just filling in
her eyebrows
you
and then to divine head cheekbones I'm
using hoola by benefit what's new this
bronzer is just absolutely amazing I'm
just using that on a spectrum Cosmetics
angled brush and obviously placing that
in the hollows of her cheekbones
then taking my new favorite glowy
bronzer which is the bomb betty
loumanizer I'm just going over her
cheekbones just to add that extra glow
it's so amazing in real life oh my god
love it and then just using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder again I'm
just using that on the same beauty
blender as before and baking her contour
so basically I'm just creating a line
right beneath her contour leaving that
on for about 30 seconds and then
brushing it off and then in the meantime
I'm at using the bomb hot mama blush and
placing that on her cheeks and then for
highlighter I'm using Mac soft and
gentle as always it's my new favorite
highlighter it just looks so stunning so
I'm placing that on the high points of
her cheeks Cupid's bow tip of her nose
and then the bridge of her nose
that all depends on what you're feeling
then four-eyes I'm using a makeup geek
eyeshadows as always I'm using creme
brulee just in the crease as a
transition shade then going in with
cocoa bear just on the outer corners of
her eyes just to add a little bit of
dimension and then for the lid I used
bourbon decay a half-baked single
eyeshadow and I'm just packing that all
over the lid I actually sprayed my brush
with a bit of fixed pass before to
intensify the pigment and yeah and then
I go ahead and use the makeup addictions
cosmetics snow gold highlighter it's
actually like a pressed pigment
highlighter it's so amazing on the lids
though and I just press that on the lid
as well
then taking mock up by makeup geek and
just using that to define the outer
corners of the eyes and then for the
waterline I'm using my Maybelline eye
studio gel liner forgot what it was
called for a second in black and just
lining her waterline and then to smoke
that out I'm using mock up by a makeup
geek and I use two different brushes so
I use the first one for blending and
then this one for smudging out the liner
and then I just go in between both
brushes to get that smoky effect but
I've just using maca that's the only
color I've used the whole time
there's a mascara I'm using the benefit
they're real on a disposable mascara
wand and obviously coaching her top and
bottom lashes
in preparation for falsies and the
forces they used were the model rock
style three just with the duo lash glue
and I'm just popping that on her eyes
then for lipliner I use the Gerard
cosmetics nude lipliner honestly one of
my favorite formulas of lip liners ever
so creamy and so pigmented I'll leave a
discount code down below or if you're
listening it's jazz 25 on dried
cosmetics dot-com and then the lipstick
I used was Mac velvet teddy it's such a
popular color and it's so highly
requested by my clients
then for glass I'm using the rimmel oh
my gloss in clear and just placing that
on her lips is my favorite gloss ever
and then I'm just going over the falsies
to blend the real eye lashes with the
fake eyelashes just with the same
mascara wand and this is the final look
I hope you guys enjoyed watching learnt
something new I know this is quite
similar to Lily's makeup look just
without just with the liner in the
bottom but I really like how it turned
out so I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
