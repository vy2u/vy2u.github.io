hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so today's video is going to be of this
super glowy wearable neutral makeup look
and I'm gonna use all of two face
products it's not sponsored I just
wanted to do a full face using their
products because someone requested that
I did it and someone wanted a
cruelty-free makeup look and Too Faced
is cruelty free so the primer I used was
the Too Faced hangover primer and then
for foundation I'm only using one pump
of this just because I mainly just
wanted to like match my face with my
neck because it was tanned so I don't
really want like a full coverage look
this is in the shade sand and I'm just
placing that on my face with my damp
Beauty Blender
then for concealer I'm using one of my
new favorites which is the Born This Way
and I'm using the shade light and I'm
just putting four dots underneath my
eyes and blending that out I didn't want
to highlight the rest of my face just
because it is supposed to be a neutral
makeup look I just wanted to make my
under eyes appear brighter and more
awake so that's what I'm doing and I'm
just blending that all together with a
damp Beauty Blender again
and then to set the under eye area I'm
just using my Laura Mercier translucent
powder
I'm not baking or anything I'm just
simply setting that area just because I
didn't want a full on coverage
underneath my eyes as again I wanted to
keep it really simple and at neutral and
then to set the rest of my face I'm also
using the laura mercier translucent
powder I've never done this before
because usually I just come in with my
estrela's fresh and flawless but I
didn't want to add any more coverage so
I decided to use this product and it
actually worked really well and I really
like the finish of my skin then for
brows and using the new pony cosmetics
Mane stain I think it's a brow pomade
it's really similar to the under stars
II one anyways I'm using the shade
thoroughbred and I'm just filling in my
brows
and then taking the sweethearts bronzer
I'm using that on a spectrum Cosmetics
angled brush and just placing that in
the hollows of my cheek bones I actually
really love this bronzer it's kind of
got like a little shimmer to it so it
makes your face just look so bronzed and
glowy absolutely love it
so yeah just placing that in the hollows
around my temples jawline and then I
think I go on the sides of my nose just
for a little light nose contouring
I said to myself in this video that I
wasn't going to bake or anything but I
felt like my bronzer needed a bit of
cleaning up so I decided to bake with
the Laura Mercier translucent powder and
I'm just placing that directly
underneath my contour then for blush I'm
using the sweethearts blush I absolutely
love this blush even though it looks
like it's really shimmery it actually
doesn't come off that shimmery on the
cheeks I absolutely love the color yup
it's definitely become one of my
favorites and because I don't own a
two-faced highlighter I'm taking the new
totally cute palette and I'm taking the
shade shooting star as my highlight and
I was like blown away this is amazing
it's like it's supposed to be a
highlighter it's so weird I just loved
the way it looked and I'm just placing
that on my cheekbones Cupid's bow on the
tip of my nose and then just a little
bit down the bridge of my nose then
going in with that same palette I'm
using a double scoop which is just a
matte white cream color and I'm just
using that to set my eyelids ready for
eyeshadow and for my transition shade
I'm using these sweethearts bronzer and
I'm just placing that into my crease and
windscreen wiper motions I didn't
actually have any of my other like
chocolate bar or semi-sweet pallets with
me because they're at the salon so I
decided to improvise and use the bronzer
and I actually really like how this
color turned out then taking a shooting
star again I'm just using that on my
finger just so I can get the most
pigment and I'm just placing that all
over my lid
then using shooting star again and
placing that in my inner corners and on
my brow bone then taking the sweethearts
bronzer again I'm just using that on my
lower lash line just to even everything
out then taking chocolate doughnut from
the totally cute palette I'm just using
that as well on the lower lash line just
because I thought it needed a little bit
more depth
then I'm just curling my lashes in
preparation for mascara and the mascara
I'm using today is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara one of my all-time
favorite and I swear the travel-sized is
better than the full size I don't know
why but my lashes just come out way
better when I use the travel sized
mascara
and then the lips I'm using the Too
Faced melted lipstick in the shade -
wah-wah I actually got this because it's
a little travel size I got this in like
a pack with like a mini soleil bronzer
mini Too Faced mascara mini hangover
primer and mini eyeshadow base and I was
like $36 from Mecca so I was like hells
yeah this looks like my type of color
and I'm obsessed with it like I pretty
much wear it everyday I think I'm gonna
get the full size and then I'm just
going over the top with milkshake which
is one of their lip injection glosses
and lastly I'm spraying my face with the
slay all day by Gerard cosmetics setting
spray and this is the final look I hope
you guys enjoyed watching and learnt
something new and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
