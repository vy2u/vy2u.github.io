I'm gonna get straight into it I'm so
I'm starting off with brows i'm just
using the benefit cut brow in the shade
at number three just to use to fill in
her brows
then taking my fav concealer the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
just using that on a concealer brush and
just running that below and above the
brows this will just give them a little
bit more definition then just popping
some more of that concealer on the
eyelid just to act as a base for the
eyeshadow and then what I like to do is
go in with the Rimmel stay matte powder
and just use that to set it all in place
and just going in with the benefit gimme
brow and the show number three and just
running that through her brows to set
them in place then going in with the
morphe brushes Jaclyn hill collaboration
palette just going in with that warmish
sort of light brown color and just using
that pretty much all over the lid just
to act as a transition then taking it
this sort of coppery color and also
placing that pretty much in the same
places as we place the first shade so
just pretty much on the lid and in the
crease as well
I just realized how like messy and
careless like it makes me look but
because we're gonna be cutting the
crease and stuff it doesn't have to be
like spot-on perfect like you'll see in
the end but yeah I'm just pretty much
it's like slapping on the color and just
blending it out I'm taking the dark
brown and pretty much just working that
in the crease just because when we do
the cut crease I kind of wanted a little
bit more of a darker definition like
transition above as you'll be able to
see after we cut the crease
then taking a mixture of the dark brown
and the black and just pretty much
working that in the outer corners just
to darken it up a bit and just to make
it a little bit more dramatic and now
for the fun bit the cut crease all I've
taken is a concealer brush and some more
of the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade light and as you can see I'm
cutting the crease I'm not even gonna
bother explain I'm just gonna let you
guys watch and learn
then taking the new two-faced gold
palette I'm taking pretty much the only
gold out of the palette and just placing
that directly over top of the concealer
and taking a bit more of the black and
just using that to smoke out the outer
corners then here I'm just taking a
q-tip with some makeup remover just to
sharpen up the edges and then for
eyeliner I'm taking the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in black and just using
that to create a wing
then I'm taking these lash lab lashes
and just placing them straight on and I
use the duo at lash glue as well now
into base I'm taking the Tarte drink of
h2o gel moisturizer I love this stuff
and just placing that all over her face
just to prep then going in with a new
benefit pearl Porefessional and also
working that into the skin the
foundation I'm taking the new Naz
natural radiant long wear foundation I
mix the shades Punjab and Barcelona to
get her exact shade I know that it's not
matching her face but it does match the
rest of her body as she didn't turn her
face so yeah I'm just blending that all
in with a damp Beauty Blender
if it concealer I'm taking the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
just place my underneath her eyes
Cupid's bow chin that down the bridge of
her nose and a little bit on her
forehead and then blending it out as
well
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder just on the same
Beautyblender and just really pressing
that underneath the eyes to set the
concealer
then to set the rest of our face I'm
taking the estrela's to fresh and
flawless in the shade darkest Brown just
on a large fluffy brush and just popping
that all over our face
then back on the palette I'm taking
these two shades and using that to start
off by smoking at the lower lash line
area then I go to take the brighter
orange and also blending that in as well
then taking a narrower brush I'm using
the dark brown shade and really pressing
it in true at the lower lashes just
because when we do the waterline and
then smoke it out the gradient will be
nice and seamless you'll see when it's
done though
so yeah just blending that out and then
I'm taking the Maybelline eye studio gel
liner in the shade black and popping
that in her waterline
then I'm taking the black from the
pallet on the same detailing sort of
brush and really pressing that into the
lower lashline area and then blending it
all out to create that smoky effect then
I'm going in with the Australia's
metallics I think it's a cream eyeshadow
there's three shades is white gold and
like a bronze I'm not sure the exact
name but I love the white one and then I
go over the top with a vanilla pigment
by Mac for something a little bit
different and then I'm just going in
with mascara and just blending in the
false lashes with the real ones for
bronze I'm taking my favorite it's the
true face sweethearts one just on a
angled brush this one's just a spectrum
cosmetics one just popping that in her
cheekbone area and then around the
perimeters of her face as well and down
the sides of her nose
then I'm just going in with my favorite
contouring product the hoola by benefit
just on the brush that it came with and
just really defining her cheekbone and
jaw area
then time for some baking I'm just
taking some more of the laura mercier
translucent powder and just making a
outline directly underneath the contour
just to define it a bit more then for
blush I'm taking a Mac's petal power and
placing that on the apples of her cheeks
I love this blush because it's so glowy
and just looks so amazing on the skin
then I'm taking this Mac heart cosmetic
are highlighted now I've got this
certain to me ages ago and it's like a
rose gold color and it is seriously like
the formula of it I've never ever used a
holida like it I'm obsessed like it is
so so pigmented and it just looks so
beautiful on the skin I've been using it
ever since I received it that day so I'm
just placing that on the highest points
of her cheeks Cupid's bow and then down
the bridge of her nose
then decide to give her cheekbones a
little bit more definition by going in
with the under star see Beverly Hills
contouring key and just mixing those two
shades and just really focusing that in
the hollows of her cheeks
then Phillips I'm going in with my
favorite lip liner which is the Gerard
cosmetics sure lip liner and just lining
her lips with that and then to fill in
her lips I use the mac cosmetics kind of
sexy lipstick
and then for lipgloss I'm just taking
the Marc Jacobs sugar sugar on top one
of my favorite lip glosses ever I love
the formula and just how it looks on the
lips and that is the final look done I
