channel so first up as always I'm just
going in with the Guardium Acela water
just on a cotton pad and just putting
that all over the face just to ensure
that it's nice and clean before
moisturizing then from waster eyes I'm
just using this red one
it's just like a daily moisturizer and
I'm just popping that all over her face
then I wait at least two to three
minutes for the moisturizer to really
seep into the skin before priming and
then for primer I'm using the Too Faced
hangover primer just because Jade said
that she has like drier skin so I find
that this primer is really really
hydrating for clients with dry skin so
I'm just putting that all over her face
for foundation I'm using the Tarte
Amazonian clay and I'm mixing up with a
little bit of the Becca shimmering
liquid skin Perfector I always mix this
in with foundation just makes the face
look really nice and radiant and glowy
so I'm unsure of the shade that I use
but I'll leave it listed down below I'm
pretty sure it was like light honey or
something like that but I'm just jotting
it all over a face first and then
blending it all in with a damp Beauty
Blender
then taking the uh nastasi Beverly Hills
probe wrap palette I'm taking the shade
tap or top I didn't even know how to
pronounce it but every time I pronounce
that everyone's like oh my god you say
that word so funny but I just don't know
how to pronounce some words so I'm just
using that on my pony cosmetics eyebrow
brush and just filling in and shaping
her brows
then I'm just taking some Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade light and just
using that on a concealer brush and just
using that to define and shape the brows
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer again in the shade light and
just using that underneath her eyes to
conceal and highlight then I go ahead
true blend it all out with a damp Beauty
Blender then I go ahead and place it on
her chin that keep its buried under the
bridge of the nose and I've been on a
forehead and also blend that out
then to ensure the concealer doesn't
crease I'm just taking the laura mercier
translucent powder and using that to
bake her under eye area and I'm just
using that on a damp Beauty Blender
then taking the mac mineralize a
mineralized skinfinish and medium plus
I've been using this a few times I like
it but it doesn't add coverage like the
Australis powder so if I feel like the
client needs a bit more coverage I'll
use the estrela's but if I'm happy with
the coverage I use this because it just
simply sets the makeup in place so I'm
just placing that all over her face then
I'm just placing a little bit more of
the Maybelline fit me concealer in light
on her eyelids just to prep and prime
them for eyeshadow and then of course
setting them in a place just with some
more of the translucent powder and then
to also set the brows I'm taking the
benefit gimme brow this one's in the
shade blonde I'm pretty sure and just
running that through her brows
then taking the morphe brushes 35n
palette which is stunning by the way
it's all matte and I'm taking that first
shade there as a transition shade and
just popping that into the crease just
using windscreen or wiper motions and
yeah
then taking this really warm sort of
brownie orange shade and using that in
the crease as well just to give it a
little bit more definition
then taking the Urban Decay half-baked
single eyeshadow legit my favorite gold
I should have ever just wetted the brush
with a little bit of fix+ first and just
placing that all over the lid
and then I'm taking the bottom left
brown shade and just using that to
define the outer corners
you
you
I
then I'm just wiping away the excess
translucent powder from the baked
underneath her eye just with a really
not dense brush I feel like when I use a
dense brush it's just kind of like I
don't know takes off the concealer
underneath but this is like a really
really fluffy brush so just a little tip
then taking this really gorgeous reddish
brown shade and also using that just on
the outer corners of her eyes just to
make it a little bit more smoky
then I'm just taking a little bit of
translucent powder on an angled wedge
and just using that to sharpen up the
sides of the eyeshadow I don't like to
use concealer because I've already
powdered the face and it'll just sit
really funny so I just like to use a
translucent powder for this then I'm
taking the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
waterproof cream color in the shade
jet which is just a black and I'm going
to go ahead and do the wing so I just do
a line straight across first and then
brush off the excess powder from either
side of her eyes and then I go ahead and
do the wing
then taking the benefit they're real
mascara on a disposable mascara wand and
really generously coaching her top and
bottom lashes in preparation for false
lashes I'm just going to use the model
rock - one - I always use these for
dramatic looks like this
so yeah
now back onto face I'm taking the
gorgeous hourglass I'm pretty sure this
is called like the surreal lighting
ambient palette or something but I'll
leave it list down below anyways I'm
just taking the bronzer out of the
palette just on a angled brush and just
using that to warm up her face
then taking my bae hoola bronzer and
just using that to contour her face just
popping that in the same areas that I
used for the bronzer then taking the
laura mercier translucent powder again
and just using that to bake her contour
to make it a little bit more defined
then taking the blush out of the surreal
ambient lighting palette from hourglass
again and just using that on her cheeks
and then I'm going in with the Mac oh my
god this is like one of the Nutcracker
highlighters for the holiday edition oh
my god
I'm pretty sure this one's actually
called whisper of guilt but I am
obsessed I bought both of them
I didn't realize or $70 each but oh my
god they're so so pretty I'm obsessed so
just placing that only highest points of
her cheeks and Cupid's bow and then a
little bit on the tip of a nose and the
bridge of a nose then going in with the
same transition color I just realized it
looks a lot lighter on camera it's a
little bit more deeper kind of similar
to creme brulee by makeup geek I'm just
going to use those colors that we use in
the crease earlier down on your lower
lash line and then just taking the
whisper of guilt out of the Mac
highlighter and just highlighting her
inner corners oh my god love and then
I'm just wiping off the excess powder
from the baked as well
then I'm just lightly contouring her
nose just with the hoola bronzer if you
like watch my videos you know I'm not
really much of a nose contour fan but
obviously if the client requests it then
I do it but otherwise I just like to
like lightly sweep some bronzer on both
sides and then I'm just going in with
some mascara again just on her lower
lashes and then to line her lips I'm
using actually this L'Oreal lipliner I
came over what it's called but I'll
definitely leave it down below for you
guys it's really pigmented I've had it
for ages and I always use it when I use
like very lip sticks like this so yeah
I'm just using that to line her lips
then for lipstick I'm taking one of the
new Smashbox be legendary matte
lipsticks ones in the shade and made it
matte and oh my god these are so
comfortable to wear
considering the finish is matte they are
so creamy and pigmented I'm obsessed
I've tried some of the nude shades but
yet love love the formula of these so
obviously I'm just filling in her lips
then I'm taking the Urban Decay D slick
setting spray and just spraying that all
over a face and that is the final look
done I hope you guys enjoyed watching
and if you did don't forget to leave a
thumbs up for me and subscribe to my
