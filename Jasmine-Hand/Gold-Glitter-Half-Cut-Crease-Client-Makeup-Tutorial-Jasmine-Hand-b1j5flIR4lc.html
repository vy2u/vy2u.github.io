so first up I'm going in with the
Garnier micellar water and just making
sure the face is nice and clean before
priming then for primer I'm going in
with the benefit Porefessional and just
using that all over her face
then I like to just spray her face with
a generous amount of mac fix+ and then
for foundation I'm going in with the Mac
Studio Fix in NC 37 and I mixed in a
little bit of the becca liquid
highlighter in the shade opal and i just
put it on the face first and then it
blend it all in with a damp Beauty
Blender
you
then to color correct I'm using the LA
girl Pro concealer this one's in the
orange color and just placing like the
smallest amount underneath the eyes and
then blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender for those that don't know Orange
concealers actually correct purpley
tones underneath the eyes so then I'm
going in with the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 10 light and I
mix a little bit of the mac prolongwear
in the shade NC 15 just to add a little
bit more coverage and just using that
underneath the eyes then I go in to put
it on her Cupid's bow bridge of a nose
and then a bit on her forehead and then
blending it out as well
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to bake underneath her eyes so just
packing a lot of products on the
Beautyblender and just really pressing
it in underneath the eyes
then going in with the astrologer fresh
and flawless face powder in the shade
darkest brown and just using that to set
the rest of her face
then going in with the mac prolongwear
concealer again I'm just using that to
prime her eyelids and then just blending
it out with a smaller kabuki style brush
for brows I'm going in with the Anastasi
Beverly Hills Pro brow palette I'm going
in the shade soft brown and using that
to fill in her brows
then I'm just going in with the same
maybelline fit me concealer and just
using that Truett define the brow so
just placing some above and below
then using the brunette you need brow by
benefit just running that through her
brows to it set them in place
then using the new CRT London and Chloe
Morello palette I'm taking unconditioned
in her crease and just using that as a
transition shade
then I'm taking the shade on fire and
just using that in the crease as well
just to give it a little bit more
definition
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer and this is what I'm going to
use to cut out the crease so what you're
going to want to look for when the eyes
are closed is the actual crease socket
and then just creating the cut crease a
little bit higher just so it gives the
illusion of a bigger crease so as you
can see I'm just cutting it I'm just
using a concealer brush for this
that I'm taking the matte white which is
called my tribe and I'm just using that
to set the concealer in place then I'm
taking Queen B and just using that on
the outer corners of the eyes and just
building up the color true as intense as
you want it
so while I was actually blending the
outer corners I found that it didn't
really like blend as well into the
concealer so I probably would recommend
cutting the crease after you'd placed
all the eyeshadow down that you want so
I'm just going over the inner corners
again just with the same concealer and
then setting it again in place then I'm
taking the Lime Crime glitter glue with
the Lime Crime Leo loose glitter it's
just a really really gorgeous gold 3d
glitter and just using that straight
over the top of the glue
and then I'm just dusting away the
excess powder from the under-eye bag I
recommend you leave the bake on if
you're using loose glitters or whatever
just because when they fall out it's
just so much easier to wipe away then to
bronze up her face I'm using the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer and just using
that on an angled spectrum cosmetics
brush and just focusing that mainly on
her cheekbone area and her forehead
and then taking the benefit hoola
bronzer I'm just using that to contour
her cheekbones then taking the face of
Australia translucent powder just on the
damp Beauty Blender and just using that
to bake right underneath her contour
then taking the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner in black and just using that
to line the top lashline
so after placing a liner on the top
lashline I'm just going in with a brush
to make it all nice and smoky
and then I'm just adding some mascara on
her top and bottom lashes obviously
using a disposable mascara wand
then I'm just popping on some lashes my
favourites are the model rock - one - I
use them on pretty much all of my
clients so I'm just placing some duo
lash glue on and then placing them on
her eyes then I'm taking a Mac blush
I think it's called pedal power but I'm
not 100% sure I'll definitely leave it
down below for you guys I'm just placing
that on the apples of her cheeks then I
go in to the palette again at taking on
fire and just using that on the bottom
lash line
then taking the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner again and I'm just popping
that in her waterline
then taking the brown shade from the
palette and I'm just using that to smoke
out that liner then taking the Australis
banana powder I've actually really been
loving this lately just to put
underneath her eyes just to make them
look a little bit more brightened for
holiday i'm going in with the anastasia
beverly hills glow kit and i'm taking
the shade dipping in gold and just using
that on her cheekbones oh my god how
nice is this highlighter i've always
always always forget to use my glow kits
just because i tend to just go for like
the single highlighters but oh my god so
so obsessed
and then taking the uh Nastasia ultimate
glow kit I'm just mixing the first two
shades together and just popping them in
her inner corners
then going in with Gerard cosmetics sure
lip liner and lining her lips and then
the lipstick I used was faux by back I
know I always use his lip combo but
literally at least 80% of my clients
always ask this color it just looks oh
it's so pretty with pretty much every
single I look so yeah I'm just applying
that on her lips and then I just go over
with a clear gloss I think I'm just
using the river one that I always use
but everything that I use will
definitely be listed down below and then
to finish off the look I'm spraying the
face with the urban decay D slick
setting spray and that is the final look
done I hope you guys enjoyed watching if
