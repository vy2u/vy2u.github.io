so I originally just filmed this video
before a get ready with me but I thought
and I'm gonna do a voice over just so I
can explain what I'm doing in depth and
yeah so I pretty much just did a really
stark coppery Goldy smokey eye so if
you'd like to know how I achieved this
look then please keep watching so first
I'm going in with my holy grail primer
it is by hourglass and it's just the
veil primer and I'm just putting that
all over my face the foundation I
decided to use is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation in the color
ivory phase I'm pretty sure I'll leave
everything down below but yeah I was
eating a pizza from last night so if you
can see me chewing that's probably why
so I'm just dabbing the foundation in
with my damp Beauty Blender all over my
face I feel that a Beauty Blender
definitely gives me the most flawless
finish compared to a kabuki brushes but
that's just my preference then I'm going
in with Mac Pro Longwear concealer in MC
15 and putting that undertake my eyes to
conceal and highlight my under eye area
and also blending that in with my damn
Beauty Blender
and then I use the Ben Nye banana powder
to set that under-eye area
aisa be in love with this powder but I'm
not quite sure how I'm loving it
recently but I thought I would give it a
go because I haven't used it in so long
and I'm just studying the rest of my
foundation with my Rimmel stay matte
pressed powder and now I'm bronzing up
my cheeks using my Holy Grail bronzer
which is hoola by benefit and I'm using
a duo fiber stippling brush and now I'm
just contouring my cheekbones with the
same bronzer and I'm using the zoeva
luxe face paint brush it is amazing okay
so now I'm baking my face so what I use
to bake is a angled sponge you can get
these from Kmart target cosmetics bust
anywhere probably even price on and then
I just use a face of Australia
translucent powder and as you can see
I'm putting it on the places where I've
highlighted so for eyes I'm going to be
using makeup geek eyeshadows and firstly
I'm just gonna be taking a mixture of
creme brulee and Peach Smoothie and just
buffing that into my crease of my
transition shade and I'm just using a
really large fluffy brush so now I've
taken on a sturdy Beverly Hills single
eyeshadow in caramel I'm pretty sure and
what I'm just doing is deepening my
crease a little bit more so now I'm
taking makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in
the color grandstand and using a zoeva
flat shader brush I'm just placing that
onto my lid more towards the inner
corner of my eyes
now using that same fluffy brush we used
before I'm just blending all those
colors together so everything is
seamless so now I'm taking the matte
black eyeshadow which came in the melt
cosmetics dark matter stack as you can
see I've just packed it on on the outer
corner and then what I'm doing is
blending it with that massive fluffy
brush from before and then just
repeating the steps to build up that
really intense black color
and just a tip make sure you don't bring
the black above your crease because
that's when you're gonna look like you
got punched in the face so now I'm just
brushing off that excess face of
Australia translucent powder that they
use to bake and I'm just using a really
large fluffy brush so for wings liner I
like to use my mellow cosmetics black
gel liner it's my Holy Grail it's just
amazing to work with and then I use the
zoeva I'm pretty sure it's just a fine
liner brush and as you can see I start
off with the wing and then draw a line
from the inner corner to outer corner
and then kind of connect everything up
I'm sorry if their angles really awkward
but I'll try to upload a video in detail
and how I do my winged liner so you can
learn oh my god watching this footage
like actually makes me creamy because
this looks so painful but anyways I'm
just applying that same gel liner onto
my waterline so now I'm using the same
eyeshadow brush that I used earlier to
pack on that matte black eyeshadow and
just smoking out the bottom lashline I
think I'm using a little bit of a darker
Brown to help smoke that out a little
bit more and then I'm just blending it
out with a large blending brush and now
I'm curling my lashes in preparation for
mascara and falsies and the mascara I'm
using is the Maybelline lash sensational
mascara it is actually amazing and then
I'm just applying some Too Faced better
than sex mascara on my bottom lashes so
I've had a few people ask me to do a
video on how to apply false lashes and
so I thought I'll do a mini tutorial
right now so what you're going to want
to do is apply the glue onto the lash
band wait 30 seconds and then pull it
onto your eyes
and as you can see I'm just using my
tweezers to kind of sculpt and shape the
lashes so they fit onto my eyes
comfortably because the last thing I
want is uncomfortable lashes so for
highlighter I'm using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
I'm just placing that on meet of my
cheekbones Cupid's bow down the bridge
of my nose and above the arches of my
brows and align my lips I'm using the
Rimmel exaggerate lip liner in natural
I'm pretty sure if not it'll definitely
be down below and and slightly over
drawing my lips as per usual
and the lipstick I'm using is Mac's
velvet teddy this has got to be probably
my favorite MAC lipstick ever it just
goes with every single book and just
love the way it looks on my skintone and
over top I'm just using the NYX
Cosmetics of butter gloss and creme
brulee and this is the completed look
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to give this video a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
