so I'm just gonna get straight into it
so basically what I'm using is a body
paint now I got this from Stax which is
a $2 shop if you're from Australia I
don't know if you can actually put on
your face but it works pretty well for
me I guess but obviously if you have
sensitive skin or whatever I probably
would suggest a face paint of some sort
but yeah as you can see I'm just putting
that all over my face and then I'm just
going in with a translucent powder I'm
pretty sure i'm just using the face of
australia one just to set that all in
place and then I'm just taking some
black face paint I got this palette from
Stax as well and it was $2.00 or
something like that so I'm just going
ahead and creating the eye of the skull
and I'm just using my zoeva winged liner
brush I probably wouldn't suggest using
expensive brushes because they are
pretty much all ruined now so yeah if
you're gonna use makeup brushes then use
old shitty ones because mine correct and
then I'm just using one of those shitty
like eyeshadow applicators that you get
in palettes just to fill in the rest of
my eye because otherwise it'll take ages
to fill it in with that little liner
brush
so now I'm just sitting that area with
the makeup geek eyeshadow incorrupt it's
just a matte black eyeshadow any
eyeshadow will do and yeah so this Real
Techniques brush is completely ruined I
washed it straight after and the
bristles are staying black so that's
always a bonus and then I'm just lining
my waterline with a black eyeliner as
well okay so now I'm moving on to the
mouth as you can see I'm just drawing a
line from the side of my mouth to about
halfway up my face
and now I'm tracing out the jaw oh and
by the way I'm still using corrupt which
is just a matte black eyeshadow for all
of this
I'm just so it's easier to blend so yeah
basically I'm just drawing the jaw you
can see what I'm doing I'm sure I was
just copying a photo anyways so as you
can see I'm just making the lines a
little bit thicker and then just filling
in the inner section of the I guess the
back of the jaw okay so the first step
in creating the teeth all you have to do
is just create straight vertical lines
making sure that they match from the top
to the bottom teeth otherwise it'll just
look silly
okay so now to around those teeth up I
feel like it's probably more beneficial
to you if you just watch rather than me
talking because it's pretty hard to
explain but as you can see all I'm doing
is rounding the teeth off and making
them look more like teeth
so I'm just taking a smaller tapered
brush with no product on it all I'm
doing is just going in between the teeth
and just softening it out just so it
looks a little bit more blended and then
I'm just going in and finishing off the
rest of my teeth because I did it all
not in order
so now as you can see I'm just filling
in at the back section of the draw all
the way to the back of the tee this is
where I got some info from krispies all
I'm doing is basically just detailing
the sides of the jaws is to make a
little bit more interesting and as you
can see I'm just thickening the line and
then just blending that line out and
then I'm just doing the exact same thing
to the lower jaw
and then just using the same black face
paint I'm doing at the nose now it's
kind of a weird looking nose but it kind
of reminds me of a teardrop if that
makes sense and I just decided to shade
the perimeters of my face because it was
looking a bit bare I'm just taking it
corrupt again on a large fluffy brush
and just going along my forehead and my
jawline and this is the final look I'm
actually pretty proud of myself because
I really didn't think that it would look
anywhere near like it did but I just
want to thank you guys so much for
