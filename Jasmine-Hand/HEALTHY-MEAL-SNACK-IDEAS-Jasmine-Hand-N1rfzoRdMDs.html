right now because I just finished a
little shoot I just took my makeup off
and you know like every time you take an
makeup off your skin just looks gross
and red anyways I need to do some meal
prep for tomorrow night's meals because
I didn't quite finish them all on the
Sunday so I thought I'll show you guys
what I'm gonna make so according to the
meal plan that camera is literally
balancing on my coconut oil so on the
meal plan for the next three nights for
dinner is zucchini pasta with snow peas
and salmon I don't like salmon or
seafood so I'm just gonna cook chicken
instead they literally just chopped up
these zucchini pasta and I just use
actually it's just this thing and yeah I
just chopped the zucchinis in half and
use that to make the little pasta like
strings then I just cut up true purple
onions so usually on the meal plan it's
like tailored for one person but because
I'm doing it for two people I just
double everything so I'll show you guys
what the thing looks like so that is
what I'm cooking salmon and a zucchini
noodle ball so what it says yeah but I'm
not gonna be using salmon but I have got
some and for Alex so it says you need
400 grams of salmon Phillip and I'm just
going to use 400 grams of chicken filler
and this serves three so pretty much
like around 150 grams per serving three
zucchini spiraled one red onion 3 cups
of Snoopy's soy sauce ginger garlic
sesame oil I'm just gonna use coconut
oil olive oil and chili flakes I hate
chili so I will not be putting them in
so usually I just buy like the bulk pack
I'm a chicken breast because it says 400
grams divided by 3 I've got this scale
thing that I just got from like a
cooking shop so I use this to weigh my
chicken
I'll just cut up the just chicken breast
I'm just gonna wait and see how much
this way on its own okay so that so
that's pretty much almost 400 I'm just
gonna cut a little bit of this up I hope
I pick 397 I'm just like shopping the
chicken I move it and I'm just going to
like chop those bits in half but I like
to do is I like to season it because
it's so plain I hate playing seasoning
so I get a bit of a guesser sprinkle a
little bit of that on because it's
amazing so that's what we get to looks
like and then I just get some Cajun
seasoning it's not actually spicy even
though it says in the packet that it's
hot there's really a mix it around I'm
just gonna wash my hands put a bit of
oil okay so it says I don't know
temperature heat olive oil in a wok and
saute the onion garlic and ginger for a
few minutes and then mix through the
zucchini SOPs salmon well in that case
chicken after it's been cooked soy sauce
sesame oil and chili flakes and then mix
it together season with salt and pepper
and that is literally done it so it's
really all I'm doing now is cutting the
things of the snow peas this very
time-consuming but I love snow peas
though so I'm just cooking up the
chicken in the pan these are so amazing
breaking balls I'll make the next time
yeah okay so I'm gonna put some onion so
I'll put half of that in I'm adding it
some ginger and some garlic
you're gonna I'd like this much
I just wing it really a little bit of
ginger like that much
so now hunting Papa babe
that noise
all that smells so good okay now I'm
going to add the chicken in and let that
kind of let cook for a bit until the
zucchini goes all nice and soft and yeah
just mix it around a little bit and then
after that's cooked I'm gonna divide
this into three meals I forgot to
add the snow peas huh
adding the snow peas I love snow peas so
much
don't judge me on my cooking skills by
the way they are very amateur so that
looks about done the zucchini is all
nice and soft and the chickens cooked so
whoops I'm going to put these in through
these three containers this might be a
little bit hard to do it while filming
it's trying to get like equal amounts of
chicken and stuff in each container
there you have it my little chicken a
zucchini snow pea little Bowl it is
seriously so simple and easy and I bet
it tastes delicious so that's literally
dinner for the next three days and took
me probably not even 20 minutes to
prepare and cook so yeah that is one
meal and I'll show you guys that other
meals when I make them as well good
morning guys so it is now the next day
and this is what was on the meal plan
for breakfast now for the females it
says one piece of chalk I swear if I
have one piece of toast I'm like
starving until my snack so I have to so
it's just half an avocado on to lower
carb bread slices I get the Helga's one
from Kohl's and then just pumpkin seeds
drizzled on the top hey guys so I'm
going to continue on and show you some
quick easy and healthy snacks so this
lemon and coconut ball is on their
forty-five meal plan do a little zoom up
it's so young yeah alright so all you
need is desiccated designated
educated coconut chia seed like the
black ones cashews unsalted rack melt
syrup water vanilla extract and then
fresh lemon juice because I'm making
like double the batch because I'm also
cooking for Alex as well so I'm just
going to pretty much a double everything
but I'll let you guys know how much it
is if you just want to make a single
serve by a first up I'm gonna get the
cashews and I'm gonna put them in a food
processor don't have one of those I'm
gonna use my nutribullet it's just two
ports key in 3/4 of a cup cashew
sometimes you come back just gonna put
like just under 2 cups in everything you
learn I'm such a messy food Grizz and
that's just like one and then back so
that's how many coconuts do in peanuts
in this shot if I'm follow me over here
doll I'm not really really good
if you say this I'm going to blend it in
there and then just doesn't have to be
perfect last time I made these bowls o P
like that had cashews like so over all
right then it says 1 tablespoon of chia
seeds and I'm obviously gonna put two in

gonna add this in even though it's not
