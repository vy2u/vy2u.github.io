today I decided to do a Q&amp;amp;A video I
asked some of you guys to send me some
questions on Instagram sorry that I
haven't posted a video in a while I've
just been really really busy trying to
organize this room and it is finally
finished so I should be getting out a
lot more videos so the first question is
advice for starting a YouTube account
and Hannah Louise Boyd ass I don't know
if I'm in the right place to give other
people advices because I don't really
have that many subscribers on my youtube
but if I was to give someone advice it
would probably be to invest in a really
good quality camera the last thing I
want to do is sit down and watch a
makeup tutorial with a really cheap
camera quality so invest in a good
camera and good lighting if you don't
want to spend a couple hundred dollars
on artificial lighting just set up your
camera in front of a window especially
during the day obviously and that it
gives out really really really
flattering natural light sometimes when
it's really sunny I don't even use these
two lights or just use my ring light
just because I feel that sometimes the
makeup comes across on the camera better
with natural lighting so yeah that's my
advice so beauty by PW asks how did you
gain such a large following I don't
really know to be honest but one thing
that
I would say gets you followers but one
thing that you should do on your photos
is hashtags so if you're wearing
Anastasia Beverly Hills jeffree star
NARS make sure you hashtag them in the
photo that you're uploading wearing
those products just along with hash
tagging and famous makeup gurus like
sharing so who else jaclyn hill and then
i like to tag the pages that repost
makeup looks for example insta makeup
slave to beauty wake of the makeup
makeup fanatic one and then that
universe so done mcqueen official or
whatever you'll be able to see those
hashtags in pretty much all of my photos
that i upload so just copy them and
hopefully your works recognized by the
owner of those hashtags and they'll
repost it and then when they repost with
heaps of followers obviously you'll get
all of us so the answer to that question
jasmine underscore 98 cool name us
favorite lipstick each only pick one if
i could only pick one lipstick i would
have to choose a velvet teddy by mac
just because if i don't know what to
wear on the day i just put this on
actually i have this on at the moment
with the NYX butter gloss in the creme
brulee so yeah probably velvet teddy
if i could only choose one careful's and
ask where would you like to get with
makeup artistry and are you self taught
yes I am self-taught I would love to do
a makeup
close just so I have the qualifications
because it's so hard to get jobs when
you're a freelance makeup artist but I
am almost finished my Bachelor of
Nursing degree I have three subjects
left so I'm planning on finishing that
and then we'll see how it goes from
there but I definitely would want to do
a makeup course Lisa be us pies or
sausage rolls if I'm hungry or probably
eat both but I would have to say pies so
miss D Cueto asks this is a bit of a
disjointed sentence I think she's trying
to say limited edition make up your
thought do I love it or hate it or is
there anything that I'd love if I loved
it this is a good question because I
really don't see the point in having to
buy every single Mac a collection that
comes out I swear to God when I'm
scrolling through my Instagram feed I
see a new Mac collection every single
week and there's always people that have
to buy every single one of the products
just because they are limited edition a
lot of people just seem to buy makeup
just because it's limited edition and it
won't be available in a week's time I
just don't really see the point in that
I also don't even to the point in
releasing the lumens Edition stuff
anyways because what if you really
really like a product it won't be
available unless you buy ten so I'm kind
of on the fence but each to their own
but that's just my opinion
Ilana Beauty asks favorite drugstore and
favorite high-end brand just judging by
the amount of products I have by essence
and love I would have to say essence
my favorite two drugstore brand it's
about this drugstore zoomy I think it's
the cheapest brand you can get here in
Australia and Priceline and as far as
high-end brand I'd probably have to say
Anastasia Beverly Hills just because I
have so many of their products and love
them all sorry if I pronounce this wrong
but Bay many Australia as how to choose
the right foundation
well when I'm choosing a foundation in
Priceline or wherever I'd like to put a
little bit on my neck and if it blends
in with my neck and chest and I will
take it I don't usually like to put it
on my pan because I feel that this is
much wider than my neck for some reason
but yes I just put a little bit on my
neck and blend it out and then I wait
like 10 minutes to see if it oxidizes
because if it oxidizes it goes darker
and I don't really want a mask so I just
wait just browse around the store and if
it doesn't oxidize then obviously it's
the right color and I buy it if I like
it so yeah I hope that answers your
question
gymnasts in the city asks how many
makeup products do you have I'm not
going to particularly sit and count but
I'll probably say 200 I don't know
including brushes may are actually
including lipsticks maybe 300 physically
insane asked when did you start wearing
makeup love you I would have to say
around 70 and really wear it much in my
early teens like I would go all out in
the extra dark foundation in clumpy
mascara I didn't really go through that
phase once I started applying makeup I
to really get into it and that's when I
started watching Chen EXO and all those
YouTube videos and instagrams so I have
to say around 1617 you makeup lover
three three one sent me a few questions
and I really liked them so I will answer
them if you have to choose one makeup
company for the rest of your life what
would it be and why
now this was really hard I was thinking
about this one before I don't really
have that many products from the brand
but I'm gonna have to say Mac just
because I've tried their foundation
before and loved it and could go my
whole life with I'm wearing it a lot
better their eyeshadows their contour
powders haven't tried irath stuff but
I'm sure they are okay lipsticks
obviously love so I think Mac would have
to be my answer for that one if you
could have three celebrities as your
friends who would you choose and why
this is so hard but I really do think
that Kim Kardashian would be a fun
friend to just have as a friend to go
shopping with or Kylie Jenner just one
of those who I just think it'd be really
fun to be friends with them I don't know
why Channing Tatum then I would make him
my boyfriend and then force him to have
kids with me and live
we ever after whoo so I'm really rich
eebee Obama I'm noticing that would be
cool as well just because it's Obama I
like why wouldn't you want to be his
friend
would you rather shave off your eyebrows
or have all your eyelashes fall out
that's an easy one for me I would
obviously have all my eyelashes fall out
just because I can just put on babies
and I don't know if I could balloon
without my eyebrows Bella Davies
underscore asking all your makeup got
stolen
what four products would you purchase
straight away definitely my Revlon
Colorstay foundation this mascara
Maybelline fit me on maybelline instant
age rewind concealer in light and then
probably this contour kit just because I
can set my concealer bronze and contour
and highlight all in one palette so they
are what I would purchase first so monic
25 asks where are you from and where do
you live I live on the Gold Coast in
Australia my mum's Croatian my dad's
South African I can actually speak
Croatian Michael e underscore Shan or
Chan US women or your experience in
makeup come from I've always just had a
thing for it when I was younger I always
loved to do my friends makeup and
throughout high school I would always
get off of my friends to do that I
makeup because I was
the Queen and I make up but when I look
back at the photos now I was so bad so
embarrassing I should try and find a
photo and put it somewhere here just to
see how bad it actually was free bright
underscore art it could be anyone else
for 24 hours who would it be and why
will each other Tatum just so I could
look at you thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you
would like me to do more of these kinds
of videos and I will see you in my next
video bye guys and right in front of a
mirror obviously during that not a
mirror makeup guru you're on vacation no
