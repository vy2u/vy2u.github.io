channel so for today's video I'm doing
my highlight and contouring routine so I
decided to mix it up a little and do
half my face high-end and half my face
drugstore but before I start I want you
guys to guess which side is drugstore
and which side is high-end so pause this
video I'll have a look at my face first
and comment down below what side you
think is higher and what side you think
is drugstore before I start because I'm
really interested to see if you guys
think one side looks visibly better than
the other because to be honest they look
pretty identical to me and one side of
my face is probably worth half the price
as the other side of my face so if you'd
like to learn how I contour and
highlight then just keep on watching so
I actually already applied my face I use
the Urban Decay all nighter waterproof
along my foundation I tried for the
first time yesterday again cuz I'm
eyebrow hundred ages ago but I just
couldn't remember if I liked it or not
and I love it it's so full coverage so
yeah one of my new favorite I remember
filming this video like years ago I was
like one of my very very first
contouring and highlighting videos if
you guys to remember it remember when I
use like half of the Australis would've
been half of the Anastasia palette oh my
god that seems like so long ago now but
I'm gonna do something similar to that
but obviously using like other products
so I'm gonna start off with the high-end
side so this side will be high-end for
concealer I'm gonna go in with the Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof full
coverage concealer the one that matches
the foundation also try this concealer
for the first time the other day and I
love the coverage is a bit thick but it
is really good so with concealer you're
gonna want to pop it directly underneath
your eyes so many people don't do this
and they wonder why they look tired and
then for the drugstore side I'm going to
use the
fit me concealer if you've watched my
videos for a while you will know that
this is literally my favorite concealer
ever I use it on my clients as well so
I'm using the shade 20 sand and just
placing that in the same areas this one
is a lot creamier but is still really
good coverage that's why I love it so
this one is a little bit brighter and
then I'll just use this concealer
because it doesn't really matter I'm
just gonna highlight the center of my
face I just like to put some here down
the bridge of my nose a little bit here
and then on my chin and then I just go
in with my deck Beauty Blender and blend
it out
like this concealer blends out so well
and you'll see the Maybelline one is
literally identical it is so good the
only noticeable difference I can see
within both concealers and this one is
like a tad lighter but that's fine
because once we've bacon everything
it'll look way better so now for baking
I do get heaps of questions asking like
what is baking how do you bake
what's the point of baking so I'm gonna
tell you exactly why I baked all why
other people bake so basically baking is
a technique I'm pretty sure it
originated from drag queens but anyways
it's basically a technique where you
grab translucent powder on a beauty
blender or you can even use a brush
packing on translucent powder directly
over the top of concealer prevent it
from creasing throughout the day or my
hi inside I'm going to use the Laura
Mercier translucent powder I honestly
could not live without this stuff it is
amazing so I just take the lid off and
usually there's like stump up the top so
before I go in with the translucent
powder I just double check and make sure
that there's absolutely no creases
underneath the eyes because if you put
your translucent powder over your
concealer which already has creases
it'll just make it look even worse so I
like to look up and then really really
quickly grab the translucent powder and
really press it underneath the eyes if
you can't see the translucent powder
going on and you haven't applied enough
so you want to be able to apply it so
you can actually see like a white car
underneath the eyes I don't like to
apply too much and I don't like to leave
it underneath the eyes for too long
because I find that it can be a little
bit drying especially with people with
more drier skin
oily skin so I could probably get away
with just leaving that on until like the
end of my makeup and then just wipe it
off but only like to keep it on for like
two minutes or so just after I finish
doing my under eyes I like wipe it off
straight away then for the drugstore
side I've really been liking the remote
match perfection
translucent powder so it's basically the
exact same thing this one's just a
little bit more finely milled it's
definitely a lot more pinkier based like
the powder and then it usually while I'm
waiting for the under eye area I just go
in with my Australis fresh and flawless
in the shade medium tan and use that to
set the rest of my face I don't
typically use any cream contouring or
bronzey products just because I'm not
very good at applying them yeah I just
use mainly powdered bronzers and
contouring products so like I said
before while I have my under-eye
baked-on that is when I finish off my
under-eye area so I'm just gonna go in
with this so either palette and just run
some eyeshadow underneath it helps when
you have your baked on when you're doing
your under-eye I show because if you're
using darker colors I tend to give a lot
of fallout because I'm a bit messy with
eyeshadow and that all catches it so
when you wipe it off all the fallout
that you may have got from your
eyeshadows will just sit on top of the
translucent powder so then when you wipe
it away
it wipes away with it so now onto
bronzing up the face I've had this Bobbi
Brown bronzed up for months now and I
really just went to reach for it the
other day because I like forgot about it
I was like oh my god I remember I used
to use this bronzer all the time but
it's become my new fave recently it's a
little bit broken but it's in the shade
golden light and the bronzer brush I
typically like to use is this one it's
just from iconic London just like a nice
round big fluffy brush so I'm just
getting some of that product and then I
just go ahead and just apply it in my
cheekbone area
you don't want to be dragging this
product down you want to be focusing on
this area and blending it upwards above
your temples and along your forehead and
then I just go on the sides of my nose
usually I'm not much of a nose
contouring person I just usually find my
bronzer like on either side of my nose
and then what I like to use is the hoola
by benefit bronzer and I just like to
use the brush so that canvas and all I
do is just place that right in the
hollows of my cheek bones and along the
jaw line don't worry if you're too messy
with this and you do get a little bit
bronzer underneath your contour line
because that is what baking is for we do
that later though now for the drugstore
side a bronzer that I've been obsessed
with for years is the Rimmel natural
bronzer I love this stuff it's really
really similar truthing that give me Sun
it's really warming it has more of an
orangey antic tone which is what I lack
in bronzes so I'm just gonna take the
same brush I did try and get rid of any
excess bronzer that was on it from
before take a bit of this and just do
the same thing and then along here I
find that this one's is so pigmented I
don't even need to go in with a
contouring product like I just use this
and then fake underneath it I like to
start with less and slowly build it up
just so it looks as natural as it can
look I feel like they both look very
very similar I think I kind of like this
side
looks a little bit more softer well I
haven't baked yet so that's probably why
sorry for this side I'm gonna go into
the laura mercier who'd be honest i
never usually bake with the laura
mercier i usually bake with either the
rimmel one or the face of australia a
translucent powder which is just from
big w it's like ten dollars I'll show
you what it looks like just cuz I don't
feel the need to be using such an
expensive translucent powder on this
area of the face I don't know I would
just rather use something cheaper
because it does exactly the same thing
so on this other side I'm gonna go in
with the Rimmel one and I'm just gonna
place a line from the top of my ear all
the way to the side of my mouth so if
you guys don't know where your natural
contour is that's just a guideline so it
should look something like that I like
to leave that on for about two minutes
not too long because I don't really like
that very very sharp look I only like to
keep it on for a little bit just to give
that natural look so while that's baking
I like to do my blush I've really been
liking this bareMinerals one it's just
in the shade pink me up it's just like I
don't know it's just like a really
pretty coral color and then for the
drugstore side I'm going to use this
Maybelline fit me blush in the shade far
arduous I'm so bad at pronouncing names
it's more movie it's really pretty
though and just also just placing that
on the apples and blending it up this
one's got a little bit more of a sheen
to it so this is usually when I like to
wipe off my back so after my blush I
just go in with a big paddle brush and
wipe off the excess translucent powder
so any mistakes you would have made with
your bronzer
it's all cleaned up from that
translucent powder so I recently tried
the new Jennifer Lopez and Inglot collab
and I've never usually used loose powder
highlights like this ever but who
usually just stick to the compact
highlighters but this one is so
incredible so it's just like a loose
sparkling dust my favorite highlighting
brush that I like to use is the one from
Anastasia it's just the a23 I like to
apply my highlighter on the highest
point of my cheekbones so right here and
then I kind of like to do a backwards C
and connect it with my brow bone
highlight and then I like to put a
little bit above the arch of the brow
making sure all the edges have blended
so it doesn't look like us you know
a line of highlighter on your face may
as well just use it to heart the center
of my face so I also like to put it on
my Cupid's bow and well and then down
the bridge of my nose it's gonna fit on
my tip - okay so now for the drugstore
side so this is a Maybelline master
chrome metallic powder in the shade 100
molten gold I've seen these all over
Instagram so I'm so excited to try it
out because there really isn't that many
drugstore or highlighters out there that
are pretty decent it's gonna go in with
the brush yeah oh my god for a drugstore
ha ha that's amazing I love gold
highlighters as well I think I even may
like this better than the Inglot one and
it's like half the price oh my god
just gonna put it everywhere okay I'm
just gonna apply a lip color because I
just can't stand to be looking at my
bare lips any longer so after I've
the translucent powder from unzip the
bake sometimes what I like to do is go
over the bronze a bit sometimes it can
lose a bit of pigmentation so I'm just
gonna go in with the Rimmel bronzer and
just really go to warm up that side of
the face and then for the other side I'm
taking the Bobbi Brown one and again
just over that area I like my contour is
very natural like I don't really like to
see much of a harsh line so that's
probably like as bold as I would go for
bronzer I don't know it's just not
really my thing to really pack on heaps
at the end of the day this is why I love
drugstore makeup because you can
literally achieve the exact same thing
for half the price is why I still use
drugstore products on a day-to-day basis
because I feel like they're exactly the
same as high-end obviously there are
some high-end products that I do prefer
over drugstore so I do like using more
higher-end foundations and stuff cause I
feel like they do last a little bit
longer throughout the day and they have
a little bit more coverage but there
definitely is heaps of options out there
drugstore wise for foundations as well
but if you guys would like to see more
videos like this where I do half face
high-end and half face drugstore then
let me know in the comments down below
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
