channel so today's video is going to be
on how I do my makeup Packaging canvases
I always get a ton of questions asking
how I make them every single time I
upload them on Instagram so I thought I
would let you guys know how I do it in
this video today so all you need
basically is just a plain white canvas
that you can get from any craft store a
hot glue gun and obviously the hot glue
to go in the hot glue gun so for those
wondering the brand of the canvas this
is what it is it's just 40 by 50
centimeters that's the like size that I
usually do most of them on but I do do
another canvas after and it's slightly
smaller so it's not the same size so as
you can see I'm just taking out all of
my packaging first from their boxes and
then what I like to do first is put them
all on the canvas before I stick them on
just because obviously it takes so long
to like get all the shapes and
everything sorted out so obviously it's
much smarter to do it this way than to
just stick them on straight away so I'm
just going to let you guys watch it's
actually really satisfying to watch now
that I've looked back at it but I'm
going to let you guys watch and see what
we do
you
so once I'm happy with everything I go
ahead and glue everything down I just
placed four dots in each corner and yeah
I just screw it down it takes literally
like two seconds to do this as opposed
to like freaking half an hour to do the
first step but yeah so this is the first
packaging canvas done actually love the
way that this one turned out I think
this one's my favorite so far just
because it's so colorful I did have some
leftover packaging that I really wanted
to use so I went in with a second canvas
this one's slightly smaller as I said
before and once again we're just laying
everything out before we glue them on
and then I go ahead to glue them on
so that is how you make a makeup package
in canvas I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did don't forget to
give it a thumbs up for me and if you
make one of these tag me on Instagram I
would love to check yours out anyways
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
