it literally feels like forever since
I've sat down and filmed a video because
if you guys didn't already notice I was
away in Europe for six weeks I got back
five days ago now and this is my first
sit-down video since I've been back and
over that time I was away I accumulated
a ton of parcels so I thought why
not open them up with you guys because I
have gotten a few requests to do like a
pair box I'm opening and I kind of like
watching those videos on YouTube I've
watched them a few times so yeah I'm
just gonna get straight into it was I
can just imagine this video being like
five thousand billion minutes lot gonna
start off with this one these are the
meek skin organics mystify lipsticks
I've never heard of this brand before it
comes in like a wooden case oh this is
like a dark brown and this one is like a
coral a color that's pretty cool thank
you guys so much okay
oh pretty these are the lashes close up
okay next up Oh cute
the bait bag I'm guessing this is just
makeup bags that's really cute
thank you so I got a purple one and
there is also an actual holographic one
it is awesome I kind of wish I got these
before your next one
I know that the Star Trek packages that
I get are from Mecca so I get so excited
so oh my god Winky locks I've never
heard of this brand before it's a liquid
lipstick or lip gloss
yeah liquid lipstick wow that's so
pretty how pretty is this shade that is
definitely my kind of color it's in the
shade Molly this one I'm guessing is a
lipstick
that's so cute what the hell
wait what it's clear
okay I'm gonna swatch this and see if it
changes color it's kind of turning pink
I'm not sure how well you guys can see
that but it's like a clear lipstick like
it looks like it could go and clear but
when i swatched it it was kind of like a
sheer pink that is so cool it smell so
nice
I get so fascinated by stuff like that
as you can tell this one's more of a
brownie sort of nude really pretty come
to have never heard of this brand before
Winky locks it must be new this is like
a deep purple this one looks like a
married yeah like a newly brown and then
I just have some more lipsticks as well
I knew this video would take ages so
that one's just like a ready sort of
crazy color that is pretty oh and then
there is two eyeshadows they're the two
colors that I got eyebrow pencil that
ones
and then it has a spooly backside is
open the other ones from Mecca as well
holy oh my god so many new alagar
stuff oh my god s an hourglass so these
are the new hourglass confession ultra
slim lipsticks literally oh my god no
way stop so these are the shades and the
slim lipsticks they are so pretty I'm
gonna swatch one for you guys oh my god
so that one is in the shade I've kissed
and then these are the other ones look
how cool that looks I'll show you guys
the colors this one's like a red this
one's a pink this one's a nerd and then
this one is called I hide my and it's
like a purple next up is this says
warning this product is highly addictive
and then it says slip and Bobby Brown
Bobby Brown Beauty Blender uh-huh 9
they're so cute so I just got mini
Beauty blenders that's adorable
and then in here oh my god so it says
the full coverage formula instantly
camouflages darkness and brightens up
the under eyes hint it's like eight
hours of sleep and this is why so I've
collaborated with this company called
flip that is actually really nice it's
just like an eye mask and then you
concealers these look really similar
like packaging wise to the NARS creamy
concealer so this one's in the shade
beige and sand I'm gonna give him a
quick swatch that one looks a little bit
dark so those are the two concealers
they do feel really full-coverage I'll
definitely try those out in a video that
was a really cute
pyaare package next up Dermalogica so it
says your journey starts here a little
tote bag free cleanse balm with
cleansing mitt oh cool so it's just a
deep cleansing balm to oil melts away
impurities and makeup from skin comes
like that it's like I'm rubbing it like
that okay next one this is heavy and I'm
pretty sure this one's from a mecca as
well no shut up shut up I was literally
trying to find a face mask yesterday
because I was like my skin feel so dry
and like gross and like clogged so I was
like where's my glam glow and I was out
of it and I was literally so close to
just going and like going online and
buying like a new one like the purple
one but now I don't because I'm pretty
much stopped for life I got the purple
one that is literally my favorite so
someone that I've always using my
snapchat everyone always asks me he's
super my declaring treatment and then
I'm guessing these are their new ones so
this one is called Sun glow and this
one's the voles stomach pale blue and
then this one is glow setup oh my god no
it's a makeup setting spray what oh my
god I'm gonna try so I was like what
face masks that smells so good
what the so what are these face
masks as well no it's a moisturizer I
don't know why I automatically just
thought they'd just be face masks okay
this is a moisturizer oh my god
dead glam glow mega illuminating
moisturizer

good this one's a matte glow moisturizer
and then this one is a
megha illuminating moisturizer thank you

is their facial mist so this is a
setting spray this is the loose
translucent powder and then this is the
hang of a primer that's been out for a
while oh my god okay I'm gonna open this
last Star Trek package because I think

two three Mudd makeup and
tbx beauty that I think you might enjoy
oh so I got this all to three so for
those of you that I live in Australia
all of these products are pretty much
all drugstore brands so and they're also

of the cheapest makeup brands that you
can get here in Australia so they sent
me their contouring kit I got a I shadow
palette a primer essence toffee
eyeshadow palette now I just got some
liquid lipstick um brow gel
all this lipstick looks nice scandal

pencil and a makeup case cute yeah this
is nice just plain black oh it's huge
like two compartments to it thanks guys
that's amazing I really like
I think Anastasia Beverly Hills oh no
it's not from Anastasia it's actually
from morphe morphe collaboration with
I'm not even gonna try and pronounce
Alpha is that right oh my god wow that's
so pretty
that's what it looks like comes with a
maybe you liquid lipstick and then a
matching lip liner I'm not sure who that
girl is I might actually look up an
Instagram but that is a really really
cute color love it alright so this one
is morphe in collaboration with Britney
Bear oh okay I know this girl maybe if
I'd like saw a picture of the other girl
I would have recognized her but I didn't
recognize her from the name so this is a
nose contouring collab cool so it comes
with four different color concealers and
then these cool brushes that look like
toothbrushes so they are the brushes and
I'm guessing this is a psycho yeah
contouring palette that she uses yeah
they're powder contouring palette oh
this big box on the floor is catching my
eye so I think this is from
I don't know fashion I've I was like
okay cool I'll just quickly show you
what I got but I'm not gonna like you
know get up and try everything on in
whatever but I'm sure you guys will see
me wearing this stuff on Instagram but I
got this top that says Queen I was so
nervous to place an order because I've
never really shocked like for jeans on
an American store and I really wanted to
like try their jeans so I tried so I
asked for a size 7 which i think is like
10 to 12 Australian but they do seem
like really stretchy so I hope they fit
this oh yeah these are just tracksuit
sort of like legging bottom
I think this is gonna be wait that looks
so small what the that's not gonna
fit me even though it's a meeting this
is the top that goes with it this is
cute it's just a pink crop top another
set as well these are tiny
I did not expect them to be like this
cuz I was gonna order a large when I was
like I don't want them to be back yeah I
want them to be tight but that's like
that that literally looks like a size
six to me that is that very tiny I don't
know how these are gonna fit yes the
jeans I want so many jeans right these
are the three-quarter ones that look
like this they just go just above the
knee I'm pretty sure I have a feeling
that this one's gonna fit but that skirt
is really nice I really hope this size 7
fits because I'm gonna be so pissed off
if it doesn't because my order took like
I order them a few weeks before I left
so it's taken a while white ones are
just the high waisted all these are
really see-through high-waisted jeans
these ones look very small is it jeans
with rips through them skinny and
high-waisted
I hope they fit me oh my god okay so I
literally had to go off camera and try
one of the pair of jeans on cause I was
getting anxiety that they weren't gonna
fit but thank God they fit I'm just
gonna quickly show you so these are the
they're like a really like nice like fit
and they're high-waisted which is like
flattering because I literally all I
wear is how I said stuff I want to see
