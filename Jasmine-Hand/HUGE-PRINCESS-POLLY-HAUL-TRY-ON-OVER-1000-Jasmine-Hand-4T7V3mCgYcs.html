so today is another princess Polly try
and haul I'm obsessed with princess
Polly it's probably like my favorite
online clothing store I just find that
everything always is so true to size and
fits so well and I love all the brands
that they stop so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys but I picked up I'm going
to show you guys accessories first just
because I probably forget so first up I
got these earrings I'll zoom you guys up
later and then this gold necklace it's
just got a cross on the top and then
this little symbol on the bottom I'm
obsessed with wearing like necklaces and
earrings lately I don't know what's
gotten into me but I'm obsessed and then
I got two of the new desi don't at me at
studies ever since these got released I
was like fine and I was like I need them
in my life so I got both colors I got
black and white so these are the white
ones love and then these black these
ones have a matte finish whereas the
white ones are more sort of like shiny
but I love them joy I think I like the
white ones better though I love them
okay so now I'm too close oh my god I
have so much to show you so the first
thing is this really cute blush dress I
don't really wear dresses that often but
when I saw this on the model I was like
oh my god that is so cute basically it's
a single attack dress that does up at
the waist you'll see way better in the
trial bit but I'm obsessed with the
color and its really really flattering
as well so yeah next is a black
off-the-shoulder
bodysuit looks like this well by the way
I got that in the size 10 and this one
is in a size medium so I basically just
got medium or a size 10 because they
have like both sort of categories of
sizes on their website is an
off-the-shoulder bodysuit goes with
absolutely anything and I don't really
have any
things like this so put that pick it up
I have been obsessed with long flowy
pants recently so I picked up these
white ones they look like this and they
tie up at the front here as well and
they're just really really really long
and flowy and you can wear this with any
crop top
anybody suit I just think it's just so
flattering as well so yeah love those
next up I picked up a playsuit it's what
it is so cute I wore this over the
weekend it's just a white with sort of
leafy patterns it's just like a t-shirt
type play suit and yeah it's super cute
I also got another pair of flowy pants
so these ones just right and then I just
don't the front of them is just this
work thing that you can do up at the
waist I here's another pair so these
ones are polka-dotted and they're black
high-waisted as well they literally go
with any plane top I didn't realize how
many I picked up next I picked up a
jumper because it is starting to get a
little bit cooler and I was just
obsessed with this so it's just white
with red stripes that's a bit cropped as
well so yeah I've also become really
obsessed with the leopard print design
recently I don't know what's gotten into
me I go through so many training phases
so I bought this leopard maxi dress it's
so cute on but I probably wouldn't wear
it just alone I'd probably wear it with
a belt around the waist just because it
is quite it isn't as fitted as I thought
it would be but yeah when you're gonna
belt around the waist it looks really
cute so yeah I love that dress next up
is another place to it this one is red I
have the same one in white and I really
really like it so it just goes up like
this and it's just freely and it ties in
at the waist so then I just have three
tops left when I score this on the
website I was like oh this is not
something I would usually wear but I
really like it for some reason so it's
just basically a boob tube denim crop
top I don't know it just looks really
really cute on don't know where I'd wear
it or when I wear it but I don't know I
think you look cute for photos so I got
that one then finally I have these true
so this is just a one sleeved if you can
call it that crop black top I just think
it looks really cute on the model so I
picked that up and you could pretty much
pair that with literally anything
finally at the top that I'm wearing now
it's just a ribbed sort of cropped top
I've been wearing it like a non-stop
ever since I received it it's just so
comfy and goes with anything and the
last thing I picked up was this really
cute very nude jacket when I saw this on
the website I was like I need this in my
life it is so soft and it's just look so
cute on so I'm actually going to wear
this like every day when - I can tell I
thought this one is size large because I
wanted it to be a little bit oversized
um but yeah as you can see I love it I
literally I'm obsessed with it like look
how warm it looks I think it looks so
cool so that is everything I picked up
from princess Polly don't forget to use
my discount code which I'll leave on the
screen and in the description box down
below thank you guys so much for
watching love you guys so much and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
