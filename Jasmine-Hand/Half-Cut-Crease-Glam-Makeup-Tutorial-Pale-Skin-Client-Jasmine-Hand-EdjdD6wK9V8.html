hey guys and welcome back to my channel
I'm going to get straight into it so if
a Brad I'm going in with the benefit
browsing in the shade number three just
on my pony cosmetics eyebrow brush and
just filling in her brows
then going in with a Maybelline that fit
me concealer in the shade light and just
using that on a concealer brush just to
define the brows so just putting that
above and below and then I'm just
putting the rest on her eyelid to prep
the eyes for eye shadow
then just taking a light eyeshadow I'm
just using that to press on the lids
just to make sure everything is all nice
and dry just so when you're putting the
eyeshadow on it blends seamlessly and
then before I forget I'm going to use E
Ready Set brow by benefit just to set
her brows in place then I'm taking this
gorgeous violet Voss eyeshadow palette
called Mac about you and then I'm taking
it this shade first just for the
transition just do that on a large
blending brush and just buffing that
into the crease then I'm taking this
warm sort of coppery sort of color I'm
using that in the crease as well just to
give it a little bit more definition
just for the same fluffy blending brush
then mixing these two shades one's more
of a brick color and the other is more
of a chocolate brown and mainly focusing
that on the outer corners of her eyes
now I'm just taking that same Maybelline
fit me concealer in light and I'm using
that to cut half the crease
then I'm taking one of uh nastasi
Beverly Hills new single eyeshadows like
I remember which one this one's cool but
it was so I was like in a metallic white
color it was really really pretty on and
just pressing that just where we put the
concealer then I'm taking this Urban
Decay
razor sharp liner this one's in silver I
come over what color it's called I'll
leave everything was to down below and
all I'm doing is just basically going
over the top of the cut crease just so
it looks I don't know extra glamorous
then taking my favorite gel liner the
Maybelline eye studio in black I swear I
go through one of these like once every
two weeks that's how often I use it and
I'm just using that on her eyelids
obviously and also creating a wing I'm
the brush that I use is the zoeva winged
liner brush for those that are always
asking is one of my favorites
but first I'm just taking a cotton tip
with some Mesilla water just to crisp up
the edges just so I have a like precise
line to where I can put the wing
and I'm just taking some mascara on a
disposable mascara wand and coaching her
top lashes in preparation for false
lashes and the false lashes that I
always use that everyone always asks is
the model Rock two one true they are my
absolute favorite and I just use the duo
lash glue
now interface I'm taking the benefit
moisturizer and just popping that all
over just before primer and the primer I
used was the benefit professional one of
my favorite pore filling primers ever
and just using that around her nose and
down her t-zone area then taking the
benefits that gal primer and just
popping that on the rest of her face so
basically just around the perimeters
then I'm going in with the urban decay
this is like a skin prep spray and just
spraying that all on and then foundation
I'm taking the Mac Studio Fix and NC 15
and I mixed it with the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector the liquid one I'm pretty
sure it was in the shade moonstone so if
I just like to dot everything all over
her face and then blend it all together
with a damp view blender
you
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade of Sistine this
is a licensed color and I'm placing that
underneath her eyes a little bit on her
forehead it's down the bridge of a nose
keep its bow and chin and then blending
it all out
you
then I'm taking the laura mercier
translucent powder just packing that on
the same be blender and really pressing
it underneath the eyes this just makes
sure the concealer doesn't crease
throughout the day and yeah it's like my
favorite method of setting concealer
then for the rest of our face I'm taking
at the Maybelline Maybelline Australia's
fresh and flawless powder in the shade
nude and just pressing that all over her
face okay so now to make the lower lash
line smoky as I'm going in with
that first show that I just showed you
and just using that as a base or even a
transition color just a really soft
brown so I'm just working that into a
little lash line then I'm taking a more
narrow brush and a really dark brown and
really pressing that like basically
right underneath the waterline and then
blending it out with that same of the
lending brush that we used earlier then
I'm going in with the same on the other
eye I thought I was going in with the
Maybelline but not yet but as you can
see I'm like building up the colors as
if I would on the top so now I'm going
in with a Maybelline gel liner in black
and using that in her waterline this is
always the most uncomfortable bit I
remember when I was getting my makeup
done some do this to me I was like oh my
god what are you doing anyways then I'm
just taking a matte black and basically
just pressing that in the same place
where I put the dark brown and this will
just ensure that it looks even more
smoky the more colors you put down the
more like smoke here it's going to look
just like what you do on the top like
some more colors that you put on the
smoky art that it's gonna look so yeah
I'm just basically putting that into the
lower lash line and then at blend yeah I
hope that made sense it made sense in my
head so I hope it makes sense in your
head but at least you can see what I'm
doing
then I'm taking the jeffree star
cosmetics ice called highlighter and
using that to highlight her inner
corners I always use this to highlight
inner corners I just think it is so
intense and I'm obsessed with an intense
inner corner highlight then for bronze
I'm using at this bronzing powder from
Bobbi Brown one of my new favorites and
just using that on a today it's a
benefit brush yet I use a benefit brush
first and then I'm going in with a
angled brush by spectrum cosmetics and
just really sculpting out her cheekbones
and of course going in with hoola by
benefit just to intensify the contour a
little bit more and just to bring some
warmth back into her face
then I'm taking some more laura mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to bake underneath her contour that I'm
taking one of the new understudy Beverly
Hills blush trios I'll leave the shade
in the description box down below but
holy hell these were pigmented like I
literally barely put my brush in and
like it looks so intense I wasn't
expecting it to look like this but I
kind of like that kind of flushed look
especially on her skin tone so I didn't
mind it but usually I wouldn't put like
that much blush on so I had to like try
and blend it in with the bronzer after I
put it on then I'm taking the Ofra
highlight in Rodeo Drive honestly over
highlighters are so underrated they're
like one of my favorites like if not my
favorite highlighters at the moment they
are so intense and I just love the way
they look on the skin so I'm just
placing that on the cheekbone area on
the Cupid's bow and the tip of the nose
and then a little bit down the bridge as
well
they're not just adding some mascara
onto the lower lashes
then Philips I'm taking at the in sanity
lip line up by urban decay and this new
Estee Lauder lipstick that I recently
just received
I'll leave the name listed down below
cuz I can't remember off the top of my
head but I'm obviously lining her lips
with the lip liner and then filling in
her lips with the lipstick I can't
believe I just said that
and then on top I'm just taking these
sugar sugar lip gloss by Marc Jacobs I'm
obsessed with their glosses oh my god
they're amazing and then just finishing
off with the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and that is the final look
done I hope you guys enjoyed watching if
