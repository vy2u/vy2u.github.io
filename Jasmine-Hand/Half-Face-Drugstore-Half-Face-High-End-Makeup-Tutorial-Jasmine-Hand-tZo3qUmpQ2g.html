so in today's video I did half of my
face drugstore and half of my face
high-end and I'm so impressed on how it
turned out like I'm actually so glad
that it turned out the way that I
planned because I was really really
nervous especially when filming the eyes
because I was like what if this just
does not match and it's a complete
disaster but I'm so glad that I found
really really good drugstore
alternatives so this side of my face is
high-end and this son of my face is
drugstore and to be completely honest I
can't see any difference in both sides
of my face I think it's because I use
drugstore on a daily basis rather than
high-end like it's really really rare
that I would use a high-end foundation
because I would just rather use my
Revlon Colorstay or my covergirl three
and one so if you'd like to see how I
created this look then please keep
watching okay so I'm going to skip
primer I've just moisturized but I
figured why would I put on primer if I'm
just going to wash it off and just waste
it so my favorite high-end primer would
have to be the hourglass veil primer
pretty sure that's how it's pronounced
it's amazing especially for oily skin
and for the drugstore primer I love my
model coat face base hydrating primer
which is silicon base which I have used
heaps of my videos already so I just
thought I would give them mention before
I start on with my foundation because
I'm not going to put them on so okay so
this side of my face is going to be
drugstore and this side of my face is
going to be high-end foundation I'm
going to use from the drugstore is my
favorite covergirl three and one and I'm
going to use it with my designer brand
sponge and on the high end so I'm going
to use my Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation in the shade ivory beige with
my original Beauty Blender by the way do
you guys like my new background I kind
of just flipped my setup over so usually
I'm facing that way with like the lights
there and then yeah I'm facing the wall
but I thought I would ditch my white
backdrop because it was getting really
boring
well this sponge is actually better than
I thought because you usually like
ripoff Beauty
blender sponges I like rock hard and you
can't even like dampen them but this one
is really really bouncy except to
conceal on my hand so I'm going to use
the NARS radiant creamy concealer in
custard and on my drugstore so I'm going
to use the Maybelline fit me concealer
in a fair
you
so that is my concealer on I'm just
going to highlight the bridge of my nose
just with the Maybelline one because
it's just going to be way too hard doing
this with two different concealers but
in my opinion I think the Maybelline one
is better but I just think it's so
overpriced and like open set overhyped
maybe if I used more I would like it but
I'm just too stuck on my Maybelline one
because I just think it works amazingly
like I'm looking in the mirror right now
and they look identical so so to set my
concealer on my hand side I'm going to
be using the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit I'm just going to use the
banana shade and on my drugstore side
I'm going to use the Australis AC on
tour and I'm going to use the banana
shade I did actually post a video maybe
like eight months ago now and it has
like 50k views and it's the shittest
video ever like my contour is the tree
just like a line on my face I don't know
why I uploaded that why I thought it was
good but oh my god if you haven't
watched it go and watch it for a laugh
seriously I'll link it down I'll link it
down below but I don't know how that has
50,000 views I'm going to start off with
the drugstore side so I'm using the
Australis contour kit and my favorite
setting brush is the elf blush brush I
don't have any like high-end setting
brushes this is just the one that I use
so I'm just going to Pat that underneath
my eyes okay so now I'm using the UH
Nastasia contour kit on this side
again looking side-by-side they look
exactly the same so you know so I only
have one setting powder that I used in
my face I don't have a high end one I
actually went through all my powders and
I try to find like an expensive powder
that I haven't used but I actually don't
have one so the only powder I use is
your Stralis fresh and flawless and you
can get this from Priceline if you're
not from Australia I'm sure you can get
them from the website but I'm sure you
can get it from like email or something
if they don't ship internationally so
yeah sorry if you live um not in
Australia but you need to try and get
your hands on this powder I guess if it
bronzed up on my high-end side I'm going
to use the bomb does it bronze up with
my zoeva luxe cheek brush so my
drugstore said I'm going to use the
model ko shimmer bronzing powder with my
Jessup tapered face brush I'll have all
the Jessup brushes linked down below
they're just from eBay and you can get
them in a set for I think like $20 for
twelve of them but I'll be using the
Jessup brushes on my drugstore side
you
so to contort my high-end side I'm going
to use the hoola by benefit with the
brush that came with it
and to contour my drugstore side I'm
going to use the matte bronzing powder
by model Cove as well and this fake nos
ITA brush that I got from ebay for only
$4 that is actually really really good
the other thing I don't like about it is
that it sheds a little bit but I'll
leave the link down below where you can
purchase this one from as well
so now I'm going to clean up the contour
by baking I only use one powder to bake
and it is the face of Australia
translucent powder and it's put a little
bit in the lid and I literally just go
straight underneath my contour like that
to the side of my mouth I never used to
bring my bake all the way to the side of
my mouth but you can't even see that it
goes to the side of your mouth that just
gives like a subtle um contour line I
can never get them symmetrical so I like
to keep it on for too long because then
I get like a really really like harsh
line it's really really hard to blend
out so literally after like a minute or
two I literally wipe it off so I'm going
to do that now as you can see it's just
cleaned up the contour line and just
kind of made it less messy so the
blusher I'm going to use on my drugstore
side is this
so Susan cashmere rose chiffon brush I'm
going to use that with a dress up like
tapered angled brush and on my hand side
I'm going to use the bomb in stained
lush in Swiss dot it's just like a tad
Coralie compared to the old one and I'm
just going to use my zoeva um cheek
finish brush
doble highlighter on my high-end side
I'm going to use the Becca cosmetics
skin Perfector in Champagne pop and for
the drugstore side I'm going to use the
elf blush and got a glow and venes that
with my Jessup tapered highlighting
brush oh that's actually really pretty
this highlighter is so amazing I'm just
going to use this one to put down I'm on
the tip of my nose and Cupid's bow I'm
going to start off with the high end
side and the shadows I'm going to use
from makeup geek like these prices
aren't really high-end but I kind of
consider them high-end because even
though they are only seven dollars each
you can't just go out and just purchase
them from the shops like it's all online
so I don't know I would just kind of you
know think that they are higher-end
because some people can't really afford
like seven dollars per eye shadow when
you can just get a palette for under $20
actually don't know what I look I'm
going to do I think I might do something
really dramatic and smoky and then do
some nude lips because I did find a dupe
for velvet teddy so to start I'm going
to use creme brulee which is just a
really really nice crease shade
I'm going to go in with Coco bear which
is just a really warm brown shade also
just using that in my crease but just a
little bit below creme brulee so now for
the inner corner of the eye I'm going to
go in with shimmer shimmer which is just
this color right here it's so amazing I
pretty much use this on most of my
clients and I'm literally packing that
onto my lid making sure you don't go
above the crease now I'm going to
actually go in with my chocolate bar
palette I'm gonna take the darker color
I'm just going to Pat that onto the
outer sections and then I'm going to
take corrupt by makeup geek as well I'm
just going to place that on the very
outer V so now I'm just grabbing a
concealer brush this is just by Jessup
as well I'm pretty sure and just a light
concealer and I'm just cleaning up the
edges I'm going to use the Anastasia
Beverly Hills cream color in jet I'm
going to use that to line my waterline
so I'm just using a zoeva winged liner
brush for this okay so now that that's
looking hot I'm going to take this sort
of light brown color from the chocolate
bar and I'm just going to use that to
smoke out the black
so now I'm going to create my wing
I'm going to apply the Too Faced better
than sex mascara which is one of my
favorites so for lashes I'm just going
to use the smolder cosmetics one just
because I don't really want to wear two
different style lashes and I think I
actually have ones that are exactly the
same but ones drugstore ones high-end so
these are just the ones that I'm going
to use are just super flirty and kind of
natural sort of looking so I'm going to
pop them on okay so now that that is
done let's try and do the exact same
thing on the other side so the eye
shadow part that I'm going to be using
is the chichi cosmetics classics palette
this has been like my favorite drugstore
palette for years and I've used it for
so long so I'm going to start off at the
crease color which is this one it's just
kind of like a camel sort of um color
it's actually really really similar to
creme brulee so I'm going to take that
on a Jessup tapered blending brush even
though it's not so tapered so I'm going
to use that into my crease okay so now
I'm going to go in with the darker shade
just on the same brush and just use that
to darken the outer corner and I'm just
going to bring that into the crease a
little bit I guess and out for the inner
corner I'm going to use this shimmery
shade right here so so similar to
shimmer shimmer by makeup geek not even
funny
I don't really have another brush I just
like using this one it's just a really
dense flat shader brush I guess and I'm
just going to wet it with some elf mist
and set so if you don't want to spend
money on the fix+ and this one
definitely a good alternative for making
the eyeshadows look a bit more pigmented
I'm just going to take the blending
brush again and just blend that so
seamless in the crease and then I'm
going to take the darkest color which is
like a charcoal gray so that's probably
the only difference in both the palettes
but I'm going to add this onto the outer
my lower lash line I'm going to use the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner this is
my favorite gel liner of all time
and then I'm grabbing the dark brown
color out of the chichi palette and I'm
just taking that on a fabu Sh brush
which is an Australian brand and they're
pretty affordable so I thought they
would suit well under the drugstore
category although you can only get them
online not in-store so now for liquid
liner I'm going to use my Maybelline
hyper shop this is seriously my favorite
liquid liner I use this every time I do
my makeup if I'm not using the other
Maybelline gel liner it's seriously
amazing like watch
so now I'm going to go use the essence I
love extreme mascara which is one of my
favorite mascaras of all time so for the
lipsticks I picked out velvet teddy by
Mac and then I'm going to use that with
my world lipliner and then for the
drugstore side I'm going to use my
Australia's boho lipstick with my
Australia's lip pencil in misbehave
so this is the completed makeup look and
to be honest I am so so impressed on how
the drugstore side just looks pretty
much identical no it actually does look
identical to the high-end side like it
really does show that you don't need to
buy all this expensive makeup for your
makeup to look good like personally I
prefer drugstore products because
they're so easy to get they're
affordable and I just absolutely love
all the products that I use I love
Maybelline L'Oreal I love model Co ELF
I love all those brands and I use them
on a day-to-day basis the only higher
products that I legit could not live
with that
it's probably my haul of my benefit if I
didn't have this um I wouldn't be
contouring as well I guess
um and it's not that expensive it's like
fifty dollars and this is lasts only two
years almost so I would highly recommend
this so I really really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up also don't
hesitate to ask me any questions down
below I always answer all of your
comments thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video
hi guys my favorite concealer like I
have the NARS one and I have urban decay
one and nothing compares to this and
it's not even half the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
