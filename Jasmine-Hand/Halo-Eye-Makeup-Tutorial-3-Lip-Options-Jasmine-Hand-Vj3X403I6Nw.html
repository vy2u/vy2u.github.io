channel so first up I'm going in with
primer I'm using the benefit
Porefessional matte gel rescue and just
apply that all over and then for
foundation I'm using Mac Studio Fix in
the shade NC 37 and just applying that
with a damp Beauty Blender
then taking the la girl Pro concealer
this is in the orange color just to
counteract any purpley tones underneath
her eyes so I'm just placing that
underneath and then blending it out then
if we concealer I'm using the Maybelline
fit me in the shade light and as you can
see I'm just placing that directly
underneath her eyes Cupid's bow chin
forehead and then down the bridge of her
nose and then I blend it out
then to set underneath our eyes I'm
using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder just on a reborn large
highlighter brush I love this brush for
doing this sometimes I like to use this
sometimes I like to use a bee blender it
just all depends I just wanted to keep
the under eye area looking as less cakey
as possible that I find when I do it
this way it looks really flawless so now
I'm going in with her brows and just
taking my Anastasia brow palette this is
in the shade soft brown and then I'm
just using my pony cosmetics eyebrow
brush
then taking these same maybelline fitme
concealer before just on a concealer
brush and just using that to carve out
the brows
you
and then to prime her eyelids I'm also
using that same concealer it's amazing
for priming the eyes as well and then I
like to go and set it just with a
translucent powder just to make sure
that the eyeshadows blend really
seamlessly
I'm taking the two-faced sweethearts
bronzer and I'm using that on a spectrum
Cosmetics angled brush I don't know if
these brushes come individually or just
as a set I got this in a set so I'm not
a hundred percent sure but I'm just
placing that on her cheeks to bronze it
up and then I go ahead and apply it to
her forehead area as well
then tobacco contour i'm using the laura
mercier powder again just on an angled
wedge and just creating a line directly
underneath the contour
for blush I use the Becca cosmetics
flower child I'm obsessed with this
already it's so amazing I'm just
applying that on the apples of her
cheeks and sweeping it up past her
temples for highlighter I'm using the
new makeup geek cosmetics kathleenlights
highlighter collaboration palette I'm
using the first shade which is a gold
shade oh my god so so pretty so I'm
placing that on her cheekbones Cupid's
bow tip of her nose and the bridge of a
nose I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills highlighting brush for this
then taking the modern renaissance
palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills I'm
taking the shade red ochre on one of my
rebound crease brushes and as you can
see I keep saying as you can see placing
that in her crease as a transition color
then I'm taking Alba Jean by uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills and pretty sure this is
the artist palette I'm just placing that
on her outer corner area and then
blending it out and then I go ahead and
go in with the massive fluffy brush
again to blend it into the crease color
then I go in to place it into her inner
corner area because I wanted to create a
halo effect
then going in with these self-made
palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
going in with blossom and just placing
that on the center of the lid then going
in with the bottom two ready pinky
shades from the modern Renaissance
palette I'm just using that to smoke out
the lower lash line
then to highlight the inner corners I'm
just using soft gold single eyeshadow by
Anastasio Beverly Hills and I'm also
placing that on her brow bone area then
I'm going in with the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in black to line her
waterline then just going in with noir
by anastasia beverly hills which is just
a matte black eyeshadow and just using
that to really intensify the lower lash
line then i'm just coating her top and
bottom lashes just with some mascara on
a disposable mascara wand i used the
model rock true 1/2 lashes with my duo
lash glue and i'm just applying the
lashes so for the first lip i decided to
pair it with a pale pink nude lip just
because i've never done this before in
one of my client videos i'm using a
tight lip liner i'm unsure of the name
but i'll definitely leave it listed down
below the lipstick I used was myth by
Mac which is I believe the lighter shade
you can get and I think she pulled this
off and I absolutely love the way it
looks with the I look like so so much
and then I'm going in with just a clear
gloss I'm just using the Rimmel one as
always
then for the second lip I decided I
wanted to do something bold and pink so
I'm using an Urban Decay 24-hour glide
on lip pencil I'm unsure of the name off
the top of my head but I'll leave it
down below of course and then the
lipstick I used was pink novo by Mac oh
my god obsessed with this shade and I
think it goes with the eye makeup so
well I'm so obsessed
and for lip three I wanted to do a nice
dark vampy lip so if a lip liner I'm
using Kourt K by Kylie cosmetics and
then the lipstick I used was one of the
Urban Decay vice lipsticks in the shade
after dark I think out of all three
shades this one has definitely got to be
my favorite let me know if you guys want
to see more videos with like different
lip color options because I'd be happy
to do so so this is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed watching I love
love love the way it turned out please
let me know in the comments below what
kind of makeup looks you want to see
next on my clients and yeah thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you in my
next one
