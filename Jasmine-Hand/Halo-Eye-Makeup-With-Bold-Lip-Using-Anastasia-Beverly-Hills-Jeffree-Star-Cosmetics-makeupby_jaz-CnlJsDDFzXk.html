so in today's video I created a warm
hallo
smokey eye I just actually received an
amazing and generous package by uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills I'm so lucky so I
just thought I would create a video
straightaway using their products I hope
you guys like it and thank you for
watching
so for primer I'm going to be using the
model coat face face primer so basically
this is just a silicon base primer I
love the way it glides on my skin and
makes my foundation look it's definitely
one of my favorite drugstore primers PS
please don't mind my disgusting fake tan
hands doesn't really look like this in
real life but it always comes up really
disgusting and orange but anyways the
foundations that I'm using is a mixture
of the Revlon Colorstay and the L'Oreal
infallible these two foundations have
got to be hands-down my favorite
drugstore foundations when I'm not using
my Estee Lauder Double Wear
I'm definitely reaching to these ones
and to conceal and brighten up my under
eye area I'm using the LA girl Pro
concealer in the shade porcelain so I'm
just squeezing out a little bit of that
concealer on one of my metal plates just
because when you squeeze it out a lot
comes out at once so I just like to
evenly distribute that underneath my
eyes and now I'm just blending it all
out with my debt Beauty Blender as per
usual
so now using my Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light fair I'm
just highlighting the center of my
forehead down the bridge of my nose my
Cupid's bow and a little bit on my chin
and then also blending that out with my
damp Beauty Blender so to set all that
concealer in place I'm using my
Anastasio Beverly Hills contour kit and
is taking that banana shade on an elf
blush brush and just packing that
underneath my eyes and set the rest of
my face i'm using my Australis fresh and
flawless pressed powder in the color
darkest brown because I'm pretty tanned
at the moment and I'm just sweeping that
all over my face with a large powder
brush and this brush is by Thalia J I'll
leave everything down below and of
course as per usual I'm bronzing my face
with the hoola by benefit bronzer and
I'm just using the large stippling brush
also by Thalia Jade so now in the same
brush I'm just taking the two darker
colors from the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit as well and just bronzing
the perimeter of my face mainly focusing
on my temples jaw line under my lip and
then I'm going to contour with the shade
thorn which is a really really light
grey color and then I'm just using the
brush that came with the benefit hoola
bronzer
so now using my favorite nose contouring
brush by Pony cosmetics I'm also taking
the color fawn and contouring my nose a
little bit
and then I'm bagging my face as per
usual using my face of Australia
translucent powder with an angled sponge
so if a browser quickly I'm just filling
them in a tiny bit with the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow powder duo in the
color soft brown I'm just defining the
arch a tad and then just a little bit at
the beginning of the brow and then to
clean everything up I've just used the
same Maybelline fit me concealer in fair
and as you can see I'm just literally
cleaning up the bottom of the brows to
make them nice and crisp and then to set
it I'm just using the anastacio
brow gel but it's tinted but I can't
remember the color I think it's in dark
brown
so now as you can see I'm just taking
off that excess translucent powder
because it's been about five to ten
minutes and that's how long I'd
typically leave my bake on for so yeah
as you can see I'm just removing it
so now I'm using the bomb in stain blush
in the color Argyle so I thought I would
stay on with the theme of Anastasio
Beverly Hills so I used their highlight
out of the powder contour kit and it's
in the color sand and I seriously have
forgotten how amazing this highlight is
it's kind of like a white not really
champagne II it's just more of like a
white highlight and I really really like
how it turned out
so the eyeshadows that I'll be using are
the anastasi of Beverly Hills single
eyeshadows that I received the other day
and I'm just starting off with orange
soda into my crease with a large fluffy
brush I'm so so sorry this is going to
be really hard to follow but I was kind
of just winging it and I didn't really
plan on what I look I was doing but
anyways I'm grabbing sienna and buffing
that into my crease as well with aids
zoeva brush I'll leave all the brushes I
use down below and now I'm just using a
larger fluffy brush to diffuse the edges
and make everything is seamless so now
I'm taking hot chocolate which is a
really dark brown color and packing that
on the inner corners and the outer
corners of my eyelid and blending that
seamlessly and kind of connecting it
into the crease a little bit as you can
see it's probably easier just watching
than the explaining so now I'm just
taking a mixture of soft gold and pink
champagne
also by Anasazi Beverly Hills and just
placing that into the blank space of the
lid which is the center so now in a
smaller tapered blending brush I'm
running Sienna underneath my lower lash
line and then I'm taking the Anasazi
Beverly Hills waterproof cream color in
the color sable which is just a very
dark brown color and lining my waterline
and then I'm going to be creating a
winged
and then to smoke out the lower lashline
i'm just using a mixture of hot
chocolate and sienna on a real
techniques small blending brush so now
I'm just curling my lashes in
preparation for mascara and falsies and
the mascara I'm using as per usual is
the Maybelline lash sensational
waterproof mascara and for falsies I'm
using the social eyes lashes in mix 2.0
so by my lips I'm using the Rimmel
exaggerate full color lip liner in the
color zero five seven rubbish and then
filling them in with jeffree star
cosmetics unicorn blood velour liquid
lipstick which is such an amazing color
and this is the completed look thank you
guys so much for watching don't forget
