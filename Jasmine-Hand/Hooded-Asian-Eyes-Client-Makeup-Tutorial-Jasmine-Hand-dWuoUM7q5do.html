hey guys welcome back to my channel so
I've had heaps of requests to do a agent
mono lid tutorial so my beautiful friend
Anita volunteered to model for me she's
so gorgeous and funny so thanks so much
Anita for coming and filming with me so
first up I like to use the goddamn
Ursula water as always just to prep the
skin before primer and for primer I'm
using the benefit Porefessional matte
rescue I use this because she has really
skin I just find that it works so well
with oily skin I use it on myself as
well it's amazing and yeah I'm just
putting that evenly all over our faces
with a stippling brush
I think this brush is from makeup
addictions cosmetics then spraying her
face with the Mac prep and prime fix
plus I just find that this brings all
the moisture back into the face and it
makes the foundation go on less cakey so
the foundation I used is the Mac Studio
Fix fluid and NC 37 and as you can see
I've just put it evenly all over our
face and then buffing it all in with my
damp Beauty Blender
then for concealer of course I'm using
the Maybelline fit me in the shade light
and I'm just placing that underneath her
eyes in a upside-down triangle I'm just
using a concealer brush by makeup
addictions cosmetics and then just
blending that all in with a damp Beauty
Blender
then to set a conceal i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder and
then I'm just placing that on with like
a actually this is the Reeb on large
highlighter brush I'm actually really
enjoying baking with a brush now I don't
know why I think it kind of looks more
soft ducts I didn't really want like a
really baked highlighted look for her
because I wanted to keep it sort of
natural looking so that's why I decided
to use a brush for brows I'm using the
Anasazi beverly hills dipbrow pomade in
the shade chocolate i like to use this
product with clients that have more
sparse eyebrows just because i feel like
it really does mimic brow hairs when you
do use it as opposed to clients with
more fuller brows I feel like the dip
brow can sometimes be a little bit too
harsh just because it's like a lot
darker so yeah I like to use the dip
brow on clients such as Anita and I
think it worked really well
then I'm just sculpting the brows using
the same it fit me concealer in the
shade light just with that concealer
brush and as you can see I'm just
running that directly underneath the
brow to clean it up
then to set the brows i'm just using and
australia's brow gel it's really good
i'll leave what it's called down below
cuz i'm not 100% sure and then to sculpt
her cheeks i'm using the hoola bronzer
by benefit of course just on my mac 135
brush and as you can see i'm just
placing that in the hollows of her
cheeks jaw line and then i go ahead and
bronze up around her forehead and then I
go into contouring her nose and for that
the brush that I used was from crown
brushes
and to bake the contour I'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder just on
that same at Beauty Blender and just
creating a line from the top of that er
to the side of her mouth
and for blush I'm using the hot mama by
the balm cosmetics is like literally a
dupe for NARS orgasm it's so amazing
it's probably one of my favorite blushes
in my kit so for her glow I'm using the
Anasazi Beverly Hills Sun dipped glow
kit and I'm using the shade moonstone
which is on the bottom on the right and
I'm just placing that on the highest
points of her cheekbones down the bridge
of her nose Cupid's bow chin and then
underneath her brow bone
then I'm just brushing off the excess
powder from the contour baked
you
so for eyeshadow I'm taking Morocco by
anastasi Beverly Hills and I'm using
that in her crease as a transition shade
I feel like when you're working with
clients with mono lids like Anita one
color blown out into a smokey eye I
think is the most flattering rather than
trying you know like the light to dark
or like a cut crease or something
then taking Blanc single eyeshadow by
Anastasia Beverly Hills and just placing
that on the inner corners of her eyes
more so on her lid when she opens so you
can see the white but then I realized
after I pretty much just went over the
whole lid with fudge which is a dark
brown and I kind of defeated the purpose
of putting the light color on the inner
corners but oh well I did it anyway so I
thought I would include it
then going in with five single eyeshadow
by Anasazi Beverly Hills I'm taking that
on my Mac wait 137 is it one through
seven 237 oh my god I'm having the
biggest mind blank I'll leave it listed
down below I've just placed that on the
outer corner and then I'm just using a
massive fluffy brush to blend that all
in and then I decided to go into the
inner corner as well and just make it
like a massive blown out smoky eye which
I think looked amazing
then still using fudge I'm just taking
that on her lower lashline I'm using
zoeva and Sigma brushes for this I'll
leave everything listed down below for
you guys and yeah I'm just smudging that
into her lower lashline
then for lino at the top I've recently
been obsessed with the Tarte cosmetics
clay paint liner it is so amazing for
the price like I think it's about $32 it
comes to the liner that lasts forever
and it also comes with a little really
fine lined brush which is incredible I'm
not using that today I'm using an EXO
Beauty eyeliner brush which I'm really
loving as well so yep first I'm just
lining the top of her eye and then I'm
creating the wing I've got a winged
liner tutorial I'll leave a list on
below if you guys are interested
then to line the lips I'm using the
gerard cosmetics shirt a lip pencil and
i'm just lining her lips and then i
decided to fill in her lips with that
same liner and then i went to put the
matching lipstick on which is Rodeo
Drive also by Gerard cosmetics I'll
leave a discount code on the screen and
down below if you guys are interested
there's such amazing cosmetics and I
would highly recommend them if you're a
makeup artist and you needed some lip
colors and lip liners for your kit
you
For Lashes I use the model rock lashes
in the style two three six just with my
duo lash glue
then spraying her face with the Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray this is
my favorite to have in my kit and this
is the final look I hope you guys

something new and if you enjoyed this
