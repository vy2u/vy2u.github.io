I'm not going to be in this video but
Britney is so basically what I've done
today is what I usually would do on my
client I've had heaps of requests on a
full in-depth video about how I do my
clients what products I use and yeah so
I've done Britney's face today
obviously this is more of a dramatic
style makeup not everyone would suit
this or would want this so yeah if you
would like to know how I created this
makeup look then just keep on watching
okay so for primer I usually use the
hourglass mineral primer and that's
really good for people with oily skin
but because I'm in sydney and visiting
brittany i'm going to use the one that
she uses which is the it cosmetics serum
collagen fails so i'm just going to put
that evenly on our face usually i just
dot it everywhere and then blend it all
together with a brush but I don't have
that brush I'm just going to blend it in
with a Beauty Blender and keep in mind
guys jazz-like would normally do things
maybe a bit more professionally but
we're just here in my house and using my
makeup and stuff so like we're just
using what I have I don't have a big kid
so the foundations that I normally would
use in my kit is the Mac Studio Fix I
just think of this foundation suits
every single skin type whether it's oily
dry or combo and most of the feedback
from my clients say that it lasted all
night and it just looked amazing so Mac
Studio Fix is definitely a must-have in
your kit so I'm going to use NC 30 on
Brittany because she's really really
tanned and once again applying that with
a damp Beauty Blender make sure you get
the ears as well because I've seen some
shockers I don't actually have yeah oh
yeah an earring
make sure you actually about that it's
like hanging off now I have like the
worst ear lobes I personally like to go
over the lips because I know I just
think when you put lipliner and lipstick
on it just looks more polished so I like
to put the perfection over the lips do
you really yeah and you leave it on
there yeah until I do like lipliner and
lipstick and you put the with blood over
the top of that yeah that's so really
it's like it just acts as like a base to
your lipstick obviously make sure you
blend down the neck and behind the ear
because you know obvious reasons
okay so if we concealer underneath the
eyes I'm using the Maybelline fit me in
the lightest shade and I'm just placing
this in a triangle underneath her eye
you actually need quite a bit of this
product for coverage really yeah
cuz when I use a little bit of it it
doesn't really what are you saying that
I've got lots of like blemishes and then
I like to go over the eyelid and this
acts as a primer I don't know I just
like using concealer as primers I don't
really like the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
because it's really thick and I don't
know I just don't really like it have
you used it everyone loves it but I'm
not a fan and then I'm just blending
that in look up
so what I like to use to set that
concealer is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit and I just like to take a
mixture of the banana shade and the
lighter shade on my elf blush brush so
I'm going to get you to look up and
packing that product on actually like to
use quite a bit of product when I'm
setting the concealer so it doesn't
crease this way by the way this is like
a glam going out full coverage makeup
look like obviously you wouldn't want to
wear this if you're just going shopping
or whatever but yeah just clearing that
up close
when I just like to set the concealer -
and then to set the rest of our face I'm
using my Australis fresh and flawless
face powder in darkest brown as you
already know I love this stuff and I
have every single shade for my kit and I
would highly recommend it I've used so
many other brands of setting powder and
I think this one works the best so yeah
so I'm just dabbing it on make sure when
you do this you don't do this otherwise
you're just taking off the foundation
and it defeats the purpose
so for brows what I usually use is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow kit and
that has a kit with just heaps of
different shades of eyebrow product but
for now I'm just using the makeup geek
eyeshadow in cocoa bear note I'm using
my car so after I filled in the brow I
like to go underneath and carve it with
some light concealer so I'm just using a
Maybelline fit me and a concealer brush
and this is what makes a brow look like
it just got freshly threaded
this is the secret so usually I would
start off at the tail and I would just
map out where the arch is and make it a
bit darker at the tail and if they need
I like to extend the brow as well then
when I get to the beginning of the brow
I do a line and then I just drag the
product up again so for contouring and
bronzing I use the hoola by benefit this
one has been taken out of like a holiday
pack so I've just put it in a Z palette
just for traveling and stuff so I'm
going to go in with this one on this
brush which came with haul up and then
what I just like to do is start off at
the top of the head and make my way down
to the side of the mouth what you want
to do is drag the product up not down
because otherwise that will just defeat
the purpose of the illusion of cheap a
cheekbone okay in circular motions
dragging the product upwards
I'm going to drag some underneath her
jaw under her chin and then I'm just
going to bronze up the forehead area
okay so the blush that I'm going to use
is this one by makeup geek and it's in
the shade bliss it's just a nice coral
blush so I'm just going to grab that on
teh brush and get the client to smile no
and just placing that on the apples of
the cheeks and bringing it up to the
sides of the temples way again and now
I'm going to contour her nose and I'm
going to use this Jessup large fluff
brush and king of these from eBay in
sets for like ten dollars so they're
really really good so what I'm going to
do is just start off defining the bridge
I don't really go overly excessive with
the nose contour but I think it does tie
the face together so now I'm just
diffusing the line so they don't look
sharp I just use a big powder brush for
that so now for my favorite bit
highlighter so I'm going to use the Mac
soft and gentle on the Anastasia Beverly
Hills highlighting brush okay
so I'm going to pop that on the highest
point of the cheekbones so just like
that underneath her brow above her arch
like everywhere
pretty much
it's on flavor on the camera on her
Cupid's bow tip of her nose and this
will make her nose appear more lifted
and then just sweeping the rest on the
bridge at some point about it so this is
basically the palette of eyeshadows that
I use on almost every single client
especially these two for the transition
shade so this is creme brulee by makeup
geek this one's a morphe brushes
eyeshadow I'll leave it linked down
below I don't know what color it is
this one is shimmer shimmer and then
these ones are the ones that I use
mostly which is maca bitten and Sienna
by Anastasia Beverly Hills so the
brushes that I use are mainly Jessop
zoeva and Sigma I absolutely love this
Jessop brush and it is the two one seven
I think it's supposed to be a ripoff of
the Mac one but it actually doesn't look
anything alike it's just a really really
big fluffy brush and I'm going to go in
with this morphe brushes eyeshadow and
then a little bit of Sienna and I'm just
going to start off by warming up the
crease area like so these eyeshadows
pull in like a dream as you can see it
just looks like it blend for me it looks
like it blends for me I like it flip
okay look this way okay okay so because
Britney has wooded eyes what I'm going
to do is as you can see when she opens I
want to be able to see the eyeshadow
above her crease so that's what the plan
is close to take the ice
hi is that what you're saying yep only a
tat otherwise you won't be able to see
the eyeshadow this way okay so now that
the transition color is applied I'm
going to go in with this color which is
called hot chocolate by anastasia
beverly hills and just applying it with
a flat shader brush and because she
wants it quite dramatic i'm just
applying that all over it so when you're
packing on a darker color make sure you
don't go above the crease because that's
when you're going to look like you got
punched in the eye
so you're just wanting to pack it on
like that doesn't have to be neat or
anything so once that supply I'm just
taking a bit more of Sienna and using
that to blend the transition shade and
do it shape together
I'm just taking at the concealer brush
with the concealer that was left over
from the eyebrows and just creating a
line from the corner of the eye up to
the brow so it kind of looks a little
bit more precise so go on the other side
but I usually do this but with smokey
eyes like this I think it looks good and
it's just a nice guideline for the
eyeliner okay so the eyeliner I like to
use is the Maybelline eye studio gel
liner in a black and I like to apply
that with the Zoe bolt winged liner
brush which just looks like this is just
really narrow and thin and perfect for
winged liner mix it together
okay so then close your eyes just get
the client to close and what I'm going
to do first is just the line make sure
you don't do it too thick especially
with people with hooded eyes otherwise
when they open up their eyes all you're
going to see is the eye liner so after
that's done I'm going to get you to look
straight ahead so this is just easier
for me when I'm mapping out the wing so
looking straight ahead
and what I'm going to do is map out the
wing so like that and in the top I
literally just drag it down
now I'm going to do the bottom lashline
so I'm going to get you to look up I'm
just taking the chocolate brown color
jazz wanted to put eyeliner in my
waterline but it makes my eyes water
like crazy so we're skipping that okay
yeah usually what I would do is I would
put black in the waterline especially
with clients with blue or green eyes
because I just think that makes it pop
but this is an alternative way now I'm
just using Sienna which is what I used
in the crease and blending that out
okay now usually what I would use from a
scar is a spoolie sold have disposable
mascara wands but I'm just going to use
Brittany's mascara for this so looking
down this is just the essence I love
extreme what I like to do when I apply
the scar is I get the clients look down
open their eyelid and then just place
for the scar on like that okay so for
eyelashes what I usually use is model
rock lashes so I basically buy the bulk
set of 50 for $100 but because I'm not
at home I don't have them with me so I'm
just going to use a pair of britney's
lashes do you know which ones they are
not well they're just looking like this
they're just wispy and a lash glue i use
is the duo lash glue i love this stuff
because it dries clear and it is pretty
strong so I'm just putting that on like
this
right now other lash glue that I like is
the house of lashes lash glue because it
comes in a tube with like a little brush
so it's so easy to put on but this one
is also really good okay so I'm waiting
at least 30 seconds to a minute for this
to dry it just makes it easier for
lashes to stick okay so now I'm going to
look down and then I place it on the
outer ok so now I'm going to take soft
and gentle and place that on the inner
corner so I just think this makes the
look to be honest
all right so for lips I'm going to go in
with Max or lipliner
and then I'm just going to go in and
fill in her lips with velvet cutter
which is my face which is just slightly
more of a brown tone than the lip liner
so this is the completed look I hope you
guys enjoyed it and I learnt a few tips
and tricks if you'd like to see more
videos like this with people with
different face shapes shapes lip shapes
my brows yeah that's a good one in fact
let me know in the comments below and I
will gladly do that for you
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
