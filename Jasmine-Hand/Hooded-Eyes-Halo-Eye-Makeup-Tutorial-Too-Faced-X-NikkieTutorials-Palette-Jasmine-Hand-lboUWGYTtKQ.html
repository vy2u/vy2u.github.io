so I'm going to get straight into it so
first up I'm just using the gun EMSL
what I just on a cotton pad just to
ensure the face is nice and clean and
makeup free before the primer the primer
I used today was the benefit that gal
primer which is a brightening primer
which is amazing for people with driest
skin so yeah I'm just placing that all
over our face with a stippling brush I
think this one's by makeup addictions
cosmetics
then for underneath the eyes i'm using
the origins ginseng eye cream I never
used to use eye cream on my clients but
I found that it makes a massive
difference with the concealer and the
baking it just makes it look even more
flawless than it did without it so yeah
I'm just using that and blending it in
and then for foundation I'm using the
Mac Studio Fix in n c37 the reason why I
use Mac is because it's full coverage
and I feel like it works on everyone's
skin type and it has the best color
selection ever most of our clients are
faked hand or have like darker tanned
skin so I find that Mac foundations have
that yellowy sort of undertone which
matches absolutely perfectly when I'm
faked and I use a mixture of NC 35 and
NC 37 just for your information so yeah
that's why I decide to use Mac and then
I'm just pressing that all in with a
damp Beauty Blender then to conceal the
under eye area of course I'm using my
favorite concealer in the whole wide
world which is the Maybelline fit me in
the shade light if you haven't tried
this and I highly recommend you go out
and get it you can get it from anywhere
supermarkets
Priceline drugstores it's only 1495 full
price but I always seem to get them on
sale for around seven to eight dollars
sometimes 10 it's amazing and then to
set that concealer I'm going in with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder I'm
just using that on a reborn large powder
weight no large highlighter brush which
is my favorite for doing this and then I
just decided to sweep the rest around
her face to set her foundation I love
using this powder just to set and not
add extra coverage because I feel like
she doesn't need extra coverage because
she's already flawless and then I'm just
wiping off the powder from the bank then
going in with my understudy Beverly
Hills program palette I'm taking the
shade soft brown and just using that on
my pretty cosmetics eyebrow
to fill in her brows I've like extra
sped this up just because I felt like
you've seen this a million times before
so yeah I'm just filling in her brows
then to clean up the brows i'm just
using the maybelline fit me concealer
again in the shade light just on a and
makeup addictions cosmetics concealer
brush and as you can see i'm just going
straight underneath her brows to really
sharpen up the edges and then i'm just
placing some on her eyelid to prime her
eyes the brow gel that i've been using
is by designer brand super cheap and its
really good i couldn't find a picture to
put on the screen sorry then two bronze
i'm using my Too Faced sweethearts
bronzer for my Mac one through five
brush and as you can see I'm bronzing up
her cheeks and her forehead I put some
around her jaw line and then I got to
lightly contour her nose with this she
doesn't really need nose contouring so I
just went really light handed with that
as well
you
you
and then I'm baking her contour just
using the same laura mercier translucent
powder just on a angled wedge sponge and
I'm just creating a line from the top of
her ear to the side of her mouth then
after about a minute or so I'm just
grabbing a large fluffy powder brush and
just removing that excess powder from
the baked
then for highlight I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills moonchild
palette and I'm taking pink velvet and
oh my god this palette is so stunning I
have a review and swatches video going
up really soon hopefully this week on my
channel or next week
oh let you guys know but yeah I use pink
velvet it is stunning
okay oh my god so if I shadow I use the
two-faced nikkietutorials palette and I
was dead
it was so amazing not it was it is
amazing so I'm going in with that middle
shade I come from the name of her heart
but I have a little picture for you in
the side and I'm just using that on a
large fluffy brush by reborn but this
transition shade is more of a cool toned
color rather than a warm tone color it's
probably like three or four shades
lighter than creme brulee but it's still
really really stunning and then I'm
going in with the really rich warm brown
shade which I'm obsessed with just on my
Mac two one seven brush and I'm creating
a halo effect so I'm just placing that
on the inner corners and the outer
corners of her eye avoiding the middle
section because that's what we're going
to put the gold
you
you
then just taking a flat synthetic brush
and taking that gold eyeshadow and I was
dead it is amazing pigment amazing color
amazing everything about that shadow I'm
in love with I've been looking for a
really nice gold eyeshadow I've been
recently using the Urban Decay
half-baked one but this is ten times
better it ships on the urban decay one I
love it
and then for the inner corners I'm using
I think it's called champagne truffle
which is the highlighter out of the
palette and then I'm going in with the
Maybelline eye studio in black and I'm
just using that to line her waterline
then on a zoeva tapered brush or have
all the brushes listed down below I'm
taking that rich brown color and just
using that to smoke out her lower lash
line
temper mascara I'm using the benefit
roller lash on a disposable mascara wand
and of course coating her top and bottom
lashes
then for falsies I'm taking the model
rock to one - these are my favorite
dramatic lashes that I use in my kit
they just seriously make the look like I
love them so much and you can buy them
in bulk
I think it's 50 pairs for $95 amazing
and it's like ten dollars express
shipping you need them in your life and
then I'm going in and lending her false
lashes with her real ones just for the
same mascara wand and then I'm adding
more highlighter of course I'm using the
Mac softer gentle this is like my
all-time favorite I could not live
without it and then just going over her
lash band just with the Tarte cosmetics
clay paint liner and then to Lana lips
I'm using the Gerard cosmetics show lip
liner my favorite lip liner of all time
I pretty much use it every day on myself
if you want you can save 30 percent with
my co jazz 25 I know it says 25 it
should say 30 but it doesn't but yeah
you got 30 percent off site-wide if you
use that code and then for lips I'm
using their liquid lipstick also in the
shade sure and it is just stunning and
then I wanted to create like a subtle
ombre so then I use the myths lipstick
by Mac and then just blended it with a
shadow brush so this is the completed
look I hope you guys enjoyed watching
and learnt something new and if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up for
me and I'll see you in my next video bye
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
