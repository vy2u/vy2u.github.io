channel so today's video is going to be
something a little different on my
channel I have done one of these videos
before but ages ago so I just recently
got the new hourglass seamless finished
foundation sticks in the mail which was
kindly sent to me by Mecca so thanks
guys for thinking of me so this is what
the packaging looks like gorgeous as
always
I love hourglass products I only have
two things from hourglass they're
ambient lighting palette which I love
and the hourglass mineral veil primer
which I also love
so they've also come out with the vanish
seamless finish foundation brush which
looks like this it's really really small
like so in comparison to my hand it's
really dense but it's really soft so I
can really see how this could really
give you a flawless finish so I'll apply
it all on camera let you guys know what
my first impressions are and then I'll
come back a few hours later and give you
guys an update on how the foundation is
wearing on my face so this is what the
packaging looks like and it winds up
like this and that's what the product
looks like just do a swatch on my hand
to show you how full coverage it is so
this is the shade of warm beige which I
think will maybe match my fake tan we'll
see I might have to mix it with a little
bit of the lighter shades but yet that's
the swatch they're super full coverage
and that is why I decided to film this
video because I'm all about that full
coverage life so I'm just going to read
this little pamphlet that it came with
just to give you guys some information
about the foundation so it says double
the amount of pigment versus a
traditional foundation for instant full
coverage 12-hour long wearing waterproof
formula available in 26 change which is
good these are all the shades on the
back so it comes with quite a few darker
shades as well as heaps of lighter
shades and of course in between shades
100% report advantage was fast and easy
to use 97 percent reported vanish
covered redness and skin imperfections
covered skin discoloration pores
blemishes and dark under-eye circles it
says how to use vanish prep skin with a
veil mineral primer well I have that
today so I may as well use it so it
looks like this it's actually a little
bit dirty but it's one of my favorite
primers ever it's so beautiful and I'm
just
work that into my skin I'm not really
keen on the whole half primer half I'm
probably because I always wear primer no
matter what foundation it is and yeah I
don't know I just feel like my face
wouldn't be complete without using a
primer so I would always use primer so
I've just put that evenly all over don't
mind my freaking fake tan fingers this
finger always gets black I don't get it
maybe it's like the way I hold the
middle something so weird so then it
says apply two to three dots or vanish
to each section of the face forehead
cheeks and chin start with less and add
more as necessary formula is highly
concentrated I'm so excited
okay buff in with the vanish foundation
brush in tiny circular motions for the
seamless finish because the shape that
I'm going to go in with is warm beige so
it does look darker in real life than on
camera but it looks really light but I'm
going to go ahead and just put I have a
feeling this might be a little too dark
so that's all I've added because I want
to see how full coverage it is so I'm
going to go in with the brush okay I
think this color blends really well into
my fake tan thank God I kind of feel
like it's dry like the foundation like I
don't feel like I'm buffing in
foundation I feel like I'm buffing in
powder I don't know it's really weird
it's really thick like I feel like I
have to really like press really hard
for it to blend so if I wouldn't say
it's like full coverage but I'm going to
add more so we'll see how well it builds
up plus I don't think I added enough
anyways
okay well this foundation built up
really well
there's someone at my door ah it's
probably live from them once a false
alarm that wasn't for me unfortunately
damn it okay I'm going to continue to
buff this in it's getting to be a
full-coverage first impression of this
foundation really really really flawless
like seriously I don't usually get this
kind of finished when I use a brush
that's why I usually just use a Beauty
Blender but this brush has really really
made my skin floor because I have
lighter shades I may as well use some
underneath my eyes to highlight that
area because it does claim to be like
concealer and foundation all in one so
I'm going to try the shade nude which
just looks like this I'm just going to
place it underneath my eyes and then I'm
going to use that brush again to buff it
in
just going to go over my eyelids as well
wow that actually looks really nice time
to make the eyes as well
so I'm going to do the rest of my face
now I'll be back after I do it and I'll
just give you the lowdown on how the
foundation is sitting like underneath
all of my highlight contour blush and
everything so I'll see you in a second
all right
so I've just finished my makeup and I
love how the foundation is sitting on my
face right now
it is kind of creeping into this frown
line that I have that really pisses me
off but that can be easily like lotted I
don't know why I have pimples and have
my eyebrows so weird every time I get my
eyebrows threaded I always get pimples
okay um
it hasn't really clung on to any dry
areas of my face but like around my nose
is like cracking but that's normal that
happens with like every foundation that
I like you so usually what I do is like
really get in there but it just creases
throughout the day anyways um it is
looking really really nice on my skin
the color although is definitely in
between pink and beige base I don't know
if there's such a thing as like a beige
base foundation but I'm definitely going
to have a look into if they have any
yellow base foundation for the tear that
I use which is the loving tan one is
yellow based so I feel like in this
natural light which is like the best
lighting to see your color match it does
look a little off although on camera it
looks okay in the bathroom it looks but
off but yeah what I look at myself now
it does look like a slightly different
tone of color but it still can be pulled
off if you don't I mean so I could still
wear like I would wear this foundation
out like it doesn't even look that bad
but to get the right tone of foundation
I'm definitely going to have a look into
getting a yellow based foundation stick
publishing have put that much
highlighter up here cuz I've got pimples
but I really love how luminous the
foundation looks I would say the finish
of the foundation isn't matte but it
isn't jewy it's kind of in between and I
like that it kind of looks like a
velvety sort of finish
like it's not matte or it's not jewy I'm
up close it hasn't really sunk in into
any pause my contour highlight and blush
went on well it didn't smudge it didn't
go blotchy or anything like that so so
far I'm really really happy with this
foundation right now I'm going to go to
the Sephora Gold Coast Pacific fair
launch well I'm actually a bit late to
it but I think the doors opened at night
it's now 11:30 so I'm just going to get
there a little bit later just to check
out everything they have in store so
hopefully they have everything fully
stocked and the line isn't that long
because although I probably won't go in
but um yeah and then after that I'm
getting my eyebrows read tattooed will
retouch just on the ends a little bit so
faded and I'm doing a blog about that if
you guys are interested so yeah I will
probably be home around 8:00 8:30 so
I'll check back in with you then with
how I think the foundation is sitting up
on my skin so I'll see you then before I
go I'll give you an up close of the
foundation by the way I didn't get my
lips done I'm wearing the well lip liner
by Mac with velvet teddy on top and then
I've got the Too Faced glitter injection
in the nude one and it kind of like is
hurting my lips like it's plumping them
so hard um okay so this is what my face
looks like hopefully it's in focus so
you guys can see but absolutely loving
it so far so yeah I will see you when I
get home hey guys so it's been about
nine hours since I first applied the
foundation I have actually gone to get
my eyebrows Reeta food so there could be
like a little bit of like flakiness and
patchiness around there because she
applied like her own stuff because it
got really red from her like wiping and
stuff but I haven't touched up at all
the only time I've touched up is just
around my eyebrows just like I said my
overall thoughts of this foundation is
that I actually like it I didn't really
get shiny I only really got shiny around
my nose and on my chin when usually I
would get shiny like all down my t-zone
so it's good for oily skin types because
I have oily skin it didn't go patchy or
anything like that it's just like a
little bit of build up around my nose
but that's normal for me oh my god my
eye shadow look someone blended because
she was wiping underneath my eyes but
yeah I think the next time I put it on
I'm definitely gonna put more on because
I would say it's not a full coverage
foundation well when I applied it today
it wasn't full coverage like when I want
a full coverage look like you literally
cannot see my skin is that like that's
how I lack foundation so I think next
time I put it on I might actually buy a
shade with a yellowy undertone and I'll
use it in my tutorials so I can let you
know how that goes but I'll definitely
apply more next time and see how well it
builds up to like a really really full
coverage but I wouldn't say that I built
it up to a full coverage say more like a
medium to fall if you get what I mean
but it does look really nice on my skin
and I would definitely wear it again I
hope you guys enjoyed watching this type
of video and if you would like to see
more then leave a request of a
foundation or a product down below and
I'll be happy to do so thanks so much
for watching and I'll see you in my next
