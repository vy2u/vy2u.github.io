channel so today's video is going to be
a QA I've had so many requests to do a
makeup artist related QA so I thought I
would film why I got you guys to ask me
some questions on one of my Instagram
photos so I'm just going to go ahead and
answer your questions I start I won't be
answering any questions that are like
what's your favorite Bowl obligors
because I've recently put a video out
with all of my favorite products from
each category so definitely check that
out if you want to know or just message
me like on Instagram or snapchat I
always reply to you guys if you have any
other questions but this Q&amp;amp;A is going to
be mainly makeup artists related also I
wanted to let you guys know that there's
been a troll making an account that
looks like me replying really nasty and
rude and unnecessary comments back to
you guys make sure you actually click on
that account so you can see that they
have like no subscribers so what they've
done is taken my display picture and
then just obviously written Jasmine hand
and then replied to all you guys I've
blocked them about 50,000 times they
keep making account so there's literally
nothing I can do there's only so many
comments that I can go through and
delete but there is literally so many I
don't know why or how this person has
the time in the day to do that but I
just thought I would let you guys know
in this video just before I get started
because I've gotten so many messages
from you guys saying what the like
why you being mean to me for no reason
the what so I just wanted to quickly
make that clear it's definitely not me I
wouldn't even say that to like my worst
enemy some of the stuff that they've
said to people is literally disgusting I
don't even know why anyways I don't want
it to be a negative video or anything
but I'm going to get straight into
answering the questions so first
question comes from Maria and she asks
how did you start your business everyone
always asked me how I got started what
did I have to do blah blah blah blah so
about three years ago now I moved back
from Rockhampton I was studying my
Bachelor of Nursing degree which I went
straight into after high school
just because I had no idea what I wanted
to do and I thought nursing was
interesting when I first started nursing
I knew I wanted to do something cosmetic
nursing like injectables Botox like
theater nursing I couldn't really
picture myself being like a ward nurse
or someone that worked in aged care or
something like that but I always want to
do
something like alongside a surgeon or
something like that so I went and
studied for two years in Rockhampton
then moved back here and studied it
online for my last year and a half and
then as I was finishing my nursing
degree I was doing freelance just from
my house when I first started posting to
Instagram I just was posting photos of
myself
random makeup just selfies it was
literally just all myself like every
single photo it was a selfie and
occasionally like a makeup of the day
photo and I would do like a flat lay of
my makeup I started to get my friends
saying oh my god can you please do my
makeup I love the way you do your makeup
and I love your Instagram page like you
do amazing makeup of Allah back then I
was like you're looking at photos other
day and I was like holy I have come
a long way I'll leave them here I'll
leave my client photos like throughout
this video as well I started off
charging like my friends and then
friends of friends like $20 with lashes
the lashes I used to use we're just like
the bolt pack ones from eBay I do not
recommend them they're terrible
I don't know what I was thinking like I
was like oh yeah they're super cheap
they're like $1 for like 5 pairs or 10
pairs or whatever literally the worst
lashes ever you literally couldn't see
the eye shadow after you put them on
they were oh they were terrible I guess
the word just got around I was just
posting all my client pictures on
Instagram and yeah I was just kind of
saying like text me to book blah blah
always advertise constantly I would
literally post like up to three times a
day I don't know I just loved posting on
Instagram I was like obsessed with it
back then so I did like little
challenges like a hundred day challenges
where for example like day one would be
like use a pop of blue and then you
upload it day to show us a picture of
your foundation collection so I would do
that so it would kind of motivate me to
post more and it would give me ideas to
post so my first bit of advice for
growing an Instagram page or your makeup
business is just to keep posting the
more you post the more people will see
your staff follow you like your photos
the word will get around I'm getting off
track now so yeah I was just doing
make up applications for like 20 $25 I
did that for about six months or so and
I was getting pretty busy I was like
what the hell I was still working my
other job which was just at a restaurant
behind the bar so it was like really
hard to tackle that plus I still had a
couple months left of my nursing degree
that I had to finish so I was on
placement for that so I found it really
hard to keep up with the whole makeup
thing the thing that got me excited for
the weekend was doing makeup I
absolutely loved it I would just ask
people to do their makeup like that's
how obsessed I was with it I just wanted
to keep practicing and practicing and
practicing practice on my mom my friends
my friends would always ask me to their
eye makeup I would just literally
practice like the more people you do the
more confident you get okay I'm going
soft rack okay so basically I started
doing faces for $20 with lashes until I
built up my skill and I felt like I was
worth more so then I started to put my
prices up $40 $50 $60 $70 and then I
guess it's just gone up since then
because I feel like I'm worth that much
I feel like my skills are worth the
amount of money that I charge but it was
a long road it's taken me three years up
till then to finally I wouldn't say I've
actually mastered but become really
confident in doing other people's makeup
it is much much harder than you guys
think it is it's definitely a lot easier
to do your makeup on yourself but once
you're working with someone else's
complete head shape eye shaped skin tone
skin type it's just so hard to kind of
adjust your makeup knowledge from what
you use on your face to someone else's
face completely so I think that's
probably the most challenging thing for
me was it was just kind of hard to find
the right products that would suit most
people's skin tone skin type blah blah
blah that's how I got started and
obviously I just kept posting on
Instagram using hashtags and then bigger
pages would repost my work if you go
onto my Instagram and you go into my
comment I usually post a bunch of
hashtags or about this long I'm pretty
sure you're only allowed 30 or so tags
in each post copy and paste them into
your photos because they're the hashtags
that I found
works best for me with like reposting
and stuff like that it's really really
important to tag the brands that you're
using so then they can see it and if
they like it they'll repost it and then
that'll give you more exposure which
will give your business more exposure so
yeah it's kind of taking me three years
to build up my clientele and I guess
skills true where I am today so yeah
that was a really really long answer but
I hope I answered like a few other
questions in that as well
what is your hardest part of your job as
a makeup artist pairs I love you lot I
love you too the hardest part about
being a makeup artist is definitely the
early start for example for weddings you
have to start like five six in the
morning like you have to be there ready
and starting your first person at like
five or six depending on how many people
are in the bridal party but yeah I'm not
much of a morning person I love sleeping
in like I always sleep until like nine
or ten I know that's really bad but yeah
I think that's probably the hardest part
next question I use self-taught or do
you have a qualification I get asked
this pretty much daily I haven't done a
makeup course or anything I've just
taught myself through YouTube I think
YouTube is amazing it has so many free
amazing resources out there you don't
need to pay so much money for a course
when you have all of this online I
thought about doing a course about a
year ago and then I was that I don't
know if that will really help me like a
qualification would look cool although
there's always room to improve and gain
your skills I just don't think doing a
course would help me as much as YouTube
has helped me I will forever be watching
YouTube tutorials and I learn something
new every single day so next question is
what are your Mac shades that you have
in your kit oh my god every time I go to
the Mac Pro store I always get another
shade that I don't have so I probably
wouldn't be surprised if I had every
single shade to be honest but there is
about five or six that I pretty much use
all the time so because I live on the
Gold Coast it's typically known for it
Tanna skin so NW + NC ten to the lighter
shades one
with a yellow and pink base then NW + NC
20 they're really popular for like a
neutral skin tone probably like similar
to what mine is now it's not tan but
it's not pale it's like in between I
actually use that more often than you
think
then my Tanner colors are NC 37 that's
through my most popular color for a
fresh fake tan most hands a yellow based
so I find that that matches absolutely
perfectly because it does have a yellow
base to it and then NC 35 as well which
is slightly deeper and then NC 40 for
those that are really really faked hand
and then NC 42 sometimes so they're
probably my most popular shades that I
use and then obviously I have the three
darkest shades for the darker women next
question what is your go-to eye shadow
look for most clients I'm obsessed with
warm tones and gold oh my god so when
someone just sits in the chair and says
do whatever I don't care I love
everything you do I'm just like yes
bitch I know that this makeup look is
just going to look good on everyone so I
tend to go creme brulee in the crease
then I use a bit of cocoa bear in the
crease as well as a nice terracotta
transition then I put half base by urban
decay which is a gorgeous gold eyeshadow
in the inner corner of the eye and then
I take a Nastasia Beverly Hills fudge
which is a beautiful warm chocolate
brown and I use that on the outer
corners blend it out then I blend a
little bit underneath the lash line and
if they have blue eyes I'm not getting
so excited saying this if they have blue
eyes I always pop black in the waterline
smoke it out lashes winged liner if
there I shaped suits at nude lip faux by
Marc dead that is probably like my
signature client makeup looks next
question how do you keep your makeup
free of contamination / bacteria and how
do you sanitize your lip liners and
stuff that you use directly on clients I
have a makeup cleaner it's called the
Scotties brush makeup cleaner that you
just get from the Scotties website I'll
leave a link down below it is honestly
the best makeup brush cleaner
use the bristles dry pretty much
instantly as you spot-clean them it's
amazing so obviously after each client I
go through all the brushes that I've
used with that just on a paper towel and
then obviously clean my bead blender
with the beauty blender cleaner or I use
the days oh one as for lip liners I
sharpen them and then I spray them with
a bit of icicle so icicle is just like a
antibacterial spray with 99% alcohol I'm
pretty sure so yeah that's how I do that
the next question is where do you get
your ring light from I always get asked
this the ring light in my salon which is
the owners is the stellar lighting ring
light I'm pretty sure it's called the
diva ring light which is massive the one
that I'm using now is just from eBay it
was like $150 I'll leave a link down
below a hundred percent recommend I've
had this ring light for like two years
now it's never broken on me it's never
gone dodgy nothing it's perfect and it
was so cheap as well next question is
how do you get the concealer out of the
tubes to apply it with a brush instead I
struggle so hard oh my god I get this
question what would you think all I do
is I just go like this and twist it onto
my hand and then I just keep depositing
like the amount that I need and then I
just get my brush and put it straight on
so that's how I do it there's no like
technical things I don't use anything I
just basically just put on the back of
my hand with a brush and then put it
straight underneath their eyes so yeah
do you have bad makeup days where you
just have to remove all your work even
before you're done because it looks so
shitty
of course like that's happened to me and
my client I remember when I did makeup
from this room actually I was doing
foundation for this girl and an oxidized
way darker than I thought this is when I
first kind of started and I was like oh
my god I have to remove this like I
literally couldn't think of a way to
work with it her face just looked so
much darker than our body so I was like
sorry I'm gonna have to remove this base
and do it all again because I'm just not
happy with it but at the end of the day
they are paying you so if you're not
happy with it they're not going to be
happy with it if you get what I mean
so by all means if you want to start
fresh if it doesn't look right
do it like don't be embarrassed
everyone makes mistakes not everyone's
perfect it's happened to me and I'm sure
it'll probably happen again in my career
that's just like my camera or cameras do
you to take your Instagram photos and to
film your YouTube videos but for my
client photos I just use my canon 600d
and I pretty much just place it straight
in front of the ring light and take it
with the photo on flash it's just on the
auto setting I don't know I haven't
changed any settings on the camera so
yeah that's all I use to take my client
photos and filming my YouTube videos
just have a ring light behind my camera
which is on a tripod and then just true
softbox lights here but I take this
softbox like the square things off them
and I just have like the exposed light
either side of me I'm using my new 70d
which autofocuses oh my god look
it's autofocus thing that's so cool I
can't wait to like do a makeup store and
be like this is what I'm using and it'll
focus and then I'll focus back on my
face I'm so weird like that my 600d
doesn't autofocus so I have to like do
this and then it'll focus and then I
can't move out of the frame or I'll be
out of focus so really excited to have
this new camera how long do you take for
each client so I can do a full face of
clients makeup in 40 minutes
I allow 45 minutes each session just in
case I want to change add and it just
gives me time to spot clean my brushes
in between clients when I first started
out I took about an hour but I've kind
of like trained myself into becoming
quicker to fit more people in the day so
I think I've rambled on enough but if
you guys liked this kind of video I can
definitely do a part true with other
questions if you guys are interested I
definitely want to film an updated
what's in my freelance kit video so if
you guys are interested leave a comment
down below and let me know I hope you
guys enjoyed watching and if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up for
me and I'll see you in my next one bye
