today's video is going to be on how I
clean and sterilize my brushes and then
at the end I kind of show you how I
clean up my makeup area after a client
and what I do to spot clean my brushes
in between clients so I'm just going to
get straight into it so I don't use
anything fancy I just use a cheap cold
shampoo and then I use this days o brush
cleaner it was like two dollars and a
the Beauty Blender liquid cleanser for
my Beauty Blender so I'm going to start
off with my Beauty Blender and what I do
is I dampen it first and then this
little cleanser has like a little pump
which is super handy and I just do two
or three pumps and then I just massage
it in my hands and really like work my
fingers into it because the foundation
somehow gets right in the middle so it
does take a few times to get everything
out but this cleanser is seriously so
amazing if you're on a budget or you're
not keen on spending twenty dollars on
the bead blender liquid cleanser then I
would suggest the days o brush cleaner
if you're not from Australia then you
can just use soap I've used soap a few
times and it works really well I just
find that so it kind of dries out the
Beauty Blender but still works if you're
looking for a cheap cleanser so I know
you're supposed to use baby shampoo if
you're looking for a cheaper brush
cleaner alternative but I don't really
see the big hype or difference between a
cheap normal shampoo than a baby shampoo
I've used by be champion before and it's
not that great so I just use a $2.00
everyday shampoo from Cole's or
Woolworths the brush lathered the
shampoo and then just cleaned it in the
palm of my hands and then that's it so I
like to dry my brushes on an angle just
so the water doesn't get into the
ferrule of the brush and that's like the
correct term for the middle bit and I
thought I would show you how I roll up
this foot mat that I just got from Ikea
so I just roll it up and just place it
there and then I just use that against
the Rolly bit I'm so bad at explaining
things and then I'm just continuing to
clean my other brushes just the same way
as I clean the first one just leathering
the shampoo onto the bristles and the
swelling that in the palm of my hand and
then at taking off the excess shampoo
just make sure when you're rinsing you
get absolutely every bit of shampoo
because sometimes when I feel like I'm
finished and then I do that and then I
feel like there's more shampoo so just
make sure you get every single bit of
shampoo out of your brush so for my more
dirty brushes I tend to use the days oh
and the normal shampoo mix just because
I feel like that day's oh really does
get in the stains and like literally
gets everything out I just don't like to
use it all the time because I don't want
to waste it and my nearest dasor is like
40 minutes away from where I live so I
like to use it sparingly only when I
really need it so yeah I'm just spoiling
that in the palm of my hand
and that is all clean so for my eye
brushes I like to use the Sigma brush
cleaning mat it's basically just like a
rubber mat with like heaps of grooves
and like indents so you can deep clean
your brushes really well I actually have
a spare one for some reason I think
Sigma accidentally sent me too so if you
wanna win one I'm going to give one away
to one of you guys so just leave a
comment down below and I'll pick someone
just because I'd rather give it to one
of you guys it'll actually use it unlike
me I probably won't use the second one
because this one is perfectly fine so as
you saw just before I do like to use the
days o brush cleaner on my concealer
brushes because I feel like it just gets
out they concealer really well otherwise
I just still use the cheap shampoo so as
you can see I'm just swirling the bigger
brushes in the palm of my hand and my
eye brushes on to the
Matt okay so now on to how I sterilize
and clean my tools and makeup after
clients so I just use icicle which is
like 95 percent alcohol to clean my
metal plate that I used to deposit like
concealers and foundations on so just
use that with like a cotton I pad by the
way I got those spray bottles from eBay
I think I've got three of them for
around five to six dollars something
really really cheap but I'll leave a
link down below where you can get them
from and now I'm just cleaning my makeup
and I'm also just using icicle and a
cotton eye pad and just wiping
everything down and then I'm just
putting the lids on everything that was
just the face of Australia translucent
powder I like to have a paper towel out
just so when I'm like during a client or
after or if I need a brush really badly
I just use that paper towel to like spot
clean the brushes so it doesn't ruin the
actual towel that's underneath it
usually after clients it's like really
dirty but I didn't actually have a
client that day I just wanted to show
you what I do so this is how I clean my
brushes so I use the cinema secrets
brush cleaner when I need the brushes
during clients because I find that it
dries the bristles straight away as
opposed to the Mac brush cleaner but I
do like them both a lot all I do is I
deposit them in a empty spray bottle
that I got from eBay and then just spray
the brushes and then clean them against
like a washer or sometimes I use the
paper towel it depends tend to use my
Mac brush cleaner during the week
obviously when I don't have clients
because I find that when I use it on my
brushes the bristles don't
right as quick as a cinema secrets one
it takes maybe like I don't know 10 to
15 minutes for the bristles to be
completely dry so I just use them like
when I'm doing my own makeup and I just
can't be bothered deep cleaning my
brushes so I just use the Mac one to
quickly like spot clean them but
otherwise I'm obsessed with the cinema
secrets one so here I'm just showing you
how well the cinema secrets brush
cleaner work so I've just dipped my
brush in a shitload of black / I think
it's like a brown eyeshadow and I'm just
using the cinema secrets brush cleaner I
feel like I'm saying cinema secrets like
5,000 times but yeah I just had to do it
twice because there was a lot of product
on there sometimes when my brushes are
like really really dirty I take the lid
off the spray and then I just literally
dip the brush in and then I feel like
that cleans it way way way better but I
just like to use a spray so I don't
waste as much product because this
is expensive but I buy it from eBay
because you can't get it what doesn't
ship to Australia from America for some
weird reason so I'm going to leave a
link down below where I buy it from eBay
for you guys so now I'm just continuing
to wipe down my makeup because I'm so
OCD with dirty makeup I've freaking hate
it so I'm just using a baby wipe for
this
and then to clean my tweezers I just
spray a bit of icicle and just wipe it
down with the baby wipe so now on to how
i sanitized my lipsticks so I basically
just bring out all the lipsticks that I
use that day on my clients but because I
didn't have clients that day I just
chose some so all I do is I just spray
them with some icicle and literally that
is it I just wind them down and put the
lids on them it doesn't harm the
products in any way or anything it just
disinfects the lipsticks of all bacteria
so yeah and then I just do the same with
my lip liners except I sharpen them and
then I spray them and then I put the
lids on and that's it
anyways that is how I clean and
sterilize my brushes I hope you guys

new I know it's not the best video in
