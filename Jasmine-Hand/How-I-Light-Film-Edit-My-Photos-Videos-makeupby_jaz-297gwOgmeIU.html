today I decided to do a video all about
my lighting for my photos and YouTube
videos as well as my setup what let's I
have what camera I have what I use to
edit everything all that jazz so yeah I
just thought I'd make this video because
I get so many questions and just asked
how I take my photos so I'm just going
to smash it out and just tell you guys
so the camera that I use is the canon
600d if you're thinking about buying a
camera it's cheap really good the only
thing I don't like about it is it
doesn't autofocus you're gonna have to
manually focus so it's kind of annoying
but that's what editing is for just
going to hold the camera and show you
what I have how much it was where I got
it from and yep okay so I have these two
umbrella lights that I got from ebay I'm
pretty sure I paid around 50 Australian
dollars for them each and they came
within like under a week and they do
come with the stands that they are
sitting on is pretty much my view when
I'm filming or taking a photo so the
ring light that I bought was 115 dollars
Australian and I bought it off eBay I'll
link everything down below a little
review I absolutely love it it's I think
5400 K whatever that means I think it
means Kelvin or whatever it's perfect I
love the light and I can't really fault
it yet to be honest on the back there's
just a
which to turn it on and off I kind of
wish that there was a setting to like
adjust the lighting and then behind it
is just my tripod where I put my camera
so this is the position where I take my
up close eye photos and lip photos it's
really really easy
it's just zoomed all the way to the
fullest zoom on the camera and then I
just focus it and then I press film and
then yeah I pretty much just have like a
little compact mirror in front of me and
then just do it like that and when I
take photos sometimes I use flash
sometimes I don't because sometimes the
makeup looks better without flash if you
guys don't want to spend all this money
on lighting of course there is natural
lighting and that is probably the best
form of lighting to use I usually just
take mine in front of my front door and
yeah that's why I take my selfies and
all that but then when I want really
really detailed up-close photos that I
use this and the other thing I hate like
legit pet peeve habe like one to kill is
the ring light in my eye
I hate it I just wish that there was a
way for it not to be that I've tried
editing it just doesn't look right I
just I hate the look of the ring inside
my eye but yeah that's just me anyways I
kind of am in the process of moving all
of my makeup into the guest bedroom
where I'm gonna have this whole setup
and gonna have a desk here or I probably
won't actually know I want to flip this
kind of stuff looking this way it work
with the white wall behind me just so I
can put some pretty stuff on the wall
you're not looking at a boring bed I'm
gonna get this bed removed I'm gonna
sell it somehow go beyond like gum tree
or something or just take it to the tip
because it's not really used frequently
so yeah I get heaps and heaps and heaps
of questions on how I edit my videos so
it pretty much just import the files
into iMovie and I just edit everything
on there and then everyone asks how I
fit it onto Instagram well all I do is
just save the 15 second clip and then
send it to myself and then I have it on
my phone and then I use the app called I
think it's I'm pretty sure I don't have
it on this phone I have it on my iPad
but I'm pretty sure it's called instant
vid what anything just type in insta
collage of it or anything along those
lines I'm sure an app will come up you
can put four little videos in one like
collage you can do a video in a photo or
you can do a video on video which is
what I do or you can do anything there's
heaps and heaps and heaps and heaps of
like templates for you to use the apps
that I use is called pic FX and I use
this app just for my photos of lipsticks
or my makeup collection or whatever so
I'll just choose this picture so it just
looks like I hope you can see it it just
looks like that and then I go crop and
then I just usually like to use the
first one it kind of like makes a faded
sort of effect next app that I use to
edit is called face tune and this is
pretty much the app I use to enhance my
eye makeup photos so I'm just going to
choose this one this one has been
unedited and usually what I like to do
is if I have a pop of color I like to
use the details button
from her zoom in so you guys can see and
then I'm just gonna run that along that
line just so it kind of pops so you can
see the difference and they go like that
you kind of see it looks much brighter
and then sometimes I just Pat it over my
eyelashes and then I just use the smooth
button to press underneath my eyes to
eliminate any kind of fine lines or
whatever and that's pretty much it I'm
trying to think of other ways I use the
white and sometimes for when I'm showing
my teeth but that's really really rare
and that's about it and then I just save
it to my camera roll and then when I
upload it to Instagram what I like to do
I'm pleased that one is I like to okay
why did that just happen
No so I like to adjust the I think it's
shadows yeah so I like to adjust the
shadows down so it kind of darkens the
eye makeup look and kind of I know I
just like the way it looks when the
shadows are down and then I like to
sharpen it a little bit so it kind of
looks a little bit more HD so that's a
little trick and then sometimes I just
like to fiddle with the other settings
sometimes a used saturation to make
colors pop even more but not usually
sometimes the brightness and yeah and
they're just posted onto Instagram and
fill my water marks on my photos I use
phone to' and that's just pretty
self-explanatory I just use it to
watermark my photos so I just go add
text and then you add and then done and
it's right there you can adjust the size
too
and whatever so that is that sorry that
kind of concludes my video I hope you
guys found this helpful don't forget to
comment down below with any other video
/ tutorial suggestions so yeah thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
