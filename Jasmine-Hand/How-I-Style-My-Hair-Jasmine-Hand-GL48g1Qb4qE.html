channel so today's video is in the
collaboration with batiste so I'm sure
most of you know what batiste is they're
pretty much famous for their amazing dry
shampoos so I thought I would
collaborate with them in this video
today to give you a little beachy wavy
sort of hair tutorial so I usually just
do something similar to this beachy
waves just with a curl up I'll show you
guys how I achieved these beachy waves
and I've also used products from their
stylist rage as well as their dry
shampoo obviously my hair was so greasy
before this so you'll see how exactly I
use the dry shampoo and all of the
stylist products as well on this video
so if you would like to see how I got
this hair then just keep on watching so
I haven't washed my hair in about two
days so I'm so keen to get this mop
looking at somewhat decent so what I
like to do first is just brush my hair
through and I use a detangling brush
look like it's apparent and I probably
should cleaned it as you can see like
all the grease is like sticking to my
scalp oh so gross but it will be looking
fresh in no time and I like to do is
because I always use a middle part I'm
going to pop my hair like right in the
middle so then I like to go in with the
batiste dry shampoo so my favorite scent
is the floral and flirty one it just
mainly because I feel like this works
well with my blonde hair because it kind
of comes out a sort of a she sort of
like gray color so what I have really
bad breath and I use this it doesn't
even look like I have regrowth they do
actually come with so many different
scents and they do have some for
brunettes as well so obviously if you're
a brunette and you don't want to use
a dry shampoo that comes out white they
have a brunette one as well I literally
used dry shampoos probably every second
day just because I don't like to wash my
hair every day because apparently it's
not good for your hair
I use this every second day to like
freshen up and just get rid of all that
excess oil in my hair I honestly could
not live without dry shampoo like it is
something that I regularly buy and I
will never ever ever stop using now the
reason why I love dry shampoo is
especially the petite one is it adds
extra texture as well into the hair so
sometimes when I do my hair in
straightening it kind of like feels flat
just because I have like naturally sort
of straight hair but whereas this kind
of like texturizers it and makes it a
little bit more bouncy and yeah it just
kind of makes my hair look a bit more
full so I'm gonna go ahead and shake it
up first so then what I like to do first
is go over my middle part so I hold it
about thirty centimeters away from my
hair and just you can kind of see like
it's coming out wide and then I like to
do is I just like to get my fingers and
really work that product into my roots
and like you can already kind of see it
looks so clean and like grease free I
love it then I like to go over the sides
so I just feel like this and then the
other side and then I just get my
fingers and really work that into the
roots and then I just like to go in the
back of it alright so that's my hair all
dry shampooed and done doesn't feel oily
whatsoever it feels amazing so I'm gonna
plug in my straightener now and just go
over up my hair first with a
straightening iron and then I'll plug in
my car light under the curls so taste
now stops a range of stylist products so
they have volume spray a texturizing
spray a frizz tamer heat and shine
protect spray which I'm going to use
before I use all of my hot tools so my
hair straightener is heating up I'm
going to use the patís heat and shine
and spray it
Harriton and Inca Inchi oil just gonna
spray it a little bit and just put the
littlest bit in my hair smells so good
as well
I only just straightened it like the
littlest bit just so it has that shine
to it from the heat spray like this and
then the other side
I'm just going to get that underneath
bits as well so tricky together okay so
now that my colors all heated up what I
like to do first is just pop my hair
into two sections this is probably the
easiest bit out of everything I just
like to grab a bit from the back
probably grab about that much wind my
hair around this hold it there for about
10 seconds and then I just let it go in
my hand hold it for a few seconds and
then let it drop so it should look like
that and then I just pull it back behind
me and then I just grab another strand
from behind twirl it around wait 10
seconds and catch it in my hand and then
drop it and then just drop it behind me
I'll probably speed this bit up now
that's all my hair curled on that side
and I just like to put it back and then
I do that other side so just you suck of
the same thing
so then what I like to do is I like to
take the petite texturizing spray this
also has keratin and Inca Inchi oil in
it
and I just like to go over the curls
like this and then what I like to do is
kind of like brush them out with my
fingers and like Trish it up then
finally I like to go in with the hold me
hairspray I like this half way because
it doesn't feel stiff when you put it on
like you know how some hair sprays you
put it on and then you like can't even
move your hair whereas this one is
really good it does actually saw the
back that it is a non sticky non-stiff
hold hairspray which is for what I want
now so that I decided to go over
so there we have it that is how I style
my hair using some of the taste products
honestly can't live without my dry
shampoo like that is my ride-or-die if I
didn't have that I want to see don't
know what I will do is my life thank you
