so today's video is going to be a how to
highlight and contour routine for
beginners so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I'm going to get straight into
it so first up I'm going to go in with a
primer in order to have a smooth
seamless contour I feel like you have to
have a really flawless base otherwise
the contour and highlight can look a bit
muddy so always always always remember
to prime not to prime is a crime just
literally couldn't imagine like not
priming my face I just feel like the
foundation goes on it's so much smoother
and more even even if you don't own a
primate use a moisturizer or something
just so there's an extra layer in
between your skin and foundation I'm
just going to go in with a pore filling
primer it is the benefit Porefessional
because I have hips of the lump to the
sides of my nose it's so annoying it
only just happened like quite recently I
think I need like a facial or something
to even out my skin feels so strange to
have my eye makeup already done because
obviously I'd do it the other way around
and I'm going to go in with foundation
today I'm going to use the Maybelline
fit me in the shade 220 because I'm a
fake tan so I just like to deposit some
on my damp Beauty Blender I literally
could not live without a Beauty Blender
if you don't have an original Beauty
Blender you need to invest in one a SAP
I've tried all of the fake ones just
feel like they're nowhere near as good
as the real deal so if you're looking to
achieve a really flawless base
hands-down you need one of these in your
life I like quite a full coverage so I
probably like end up putting around two
layers on by the way this is like my
favorite drugstore foundation it's so
good it's the maybelline matte and
poreless sorry I didn't actually show
you guys that's what the packaging looks
like and I'm just dabbing it on my face
okay so now that the base is done I'm
going to go in with highlighting so I'm
going to highlight my under eyes using
the maybelline fitme concealer in the
shade light if you watch my videos you
would know this is like my holy
girl concealer evaldo when it comes to
highlighting you want to find a
concealer shade at least one or one and
a half shades lighter than your
foundation just going to go ahead and
place this underneath my eyes I tend to
use quite a generous amount of this
stuff just because I want to cover
absolutely everything underneath my eyes
um yeah you just won't get the full
effect if you only put a little bit then
put the littlest bit on my chin Cupid's
bow a little bit on the forehead and
then straight down the bridge of the
nose so once that's all done I'm going
to go ahead and blend it out I think I'm
going to need a mirror for this bit so
this is why I don't like doing my eyes
first because now I have to be really
careful of my eye shadow
okay so now that everything is blended
in you're going to want to set the
concealer underneath the eyes straight
away before it creases so everyone
always ask me what is the point of
baking it is to prevent the concealer
from creasing so what you're going to
want to do is find a translucent powder
the one I normally use is the Laura
Mercier one but I'm just going to use my
face of Australia one which is a lot
more affordable if you live in Australia
you can just get this from Priceline I
just put some in the lid put a generous
amount on your Beauty Blender and really
really press the product underneath the
eyes you want to be able to see the
baked underneath so if you can't see it
then you're not putting on enough like
to grab firm and put on the side of my
nose just because my foundation cracks
and I'm going to take the Australia's
fresh and flawless face powder legit
also my favourite this in the shade
medium tan because I'm freshly fake tan
I'm going to use that to set the rest of
my face when you're doing this make sure
you don't swipe because then that can
cause the foundation to become patchy so
what you're going to want to do is dab
again and really packing on the product
I personally love like flawless full
coverage base but obviously if that's
not your thing then you can go
definitely more light-handed on the
foundation and the powder but I just
want it all so I'm going in full glam
I'm just going to wipe off that excess
powder so obviously just jumped off
camera and applied some lipstick because
I couldn't stand seeing my pale lips any
longer so now we're going to get into
contouring and bronzing up the face so
to bronze up my face I like to use the
Too Faced sweethearts ponds of the blue
one that I always use in my videos but
ever since Michael did my makeup and he
said that he loves the Mac give me son
I've been trying it out because what
this ages ago and
I applied it and I was like wow that
looks so Orange I must have just been
applying it wrong but ever since he used
it on me I've tried using it again and I
actually really loved it so I'm going to
go in with the Mac give me Sun just on a
big powder brush this one is by Reeb on
it is there powder 12 and just swirling
my brush in tapping off the excess I'm
just going to be applying that on my
cheeks be careful when you're bronzing
not to bronze underneath this sort of
line I'll go into that more in detail
when we go to contour but make sure your
bronzing above your cheekbone because
then when you go into contouring it'll
all blend seamlessly then it just around
my forehead I've never really been a fan
of cream contouring I've tried it
recently and I found products that have
worked but I would never just do it
every time I do my makeup for one it
takes 10 times longer than powder
contour and I think I like the look of
powder contour and highlight better so I
use the benefit hoola bronzer to contour
I think it's the perfect shade for
literally every single skin tone when I
was doing Michael's makeup I went to
reach for this and it was like don't use
that it's so great but I don't know I
just don't really find it great on
myself and I use it on pretty much every
client and I don't find the contour gray
at all like it just looks so beautiful
and seamless and I just love this
product so much I've gone through like
five of them another thing I love about
it is it comes with a brush to contour
with I don't have it in here today and I
don't have another one to show you
because the other day I left my freaking
door open and Frankie came in and all of
my makeup that was on the floor I know
it probably shouldn't have been on the
floor legit ripped to absolute shreds
and that brush was on the floor
thankfully it was only like the
packaging that was mostly on the floor
so he didn't ruin too much makeup
otherwise I've ever been so pierced so
because I don't have the contouring
brush that it came with I'm just going
to use this angled brush it is the
spectrum a05 this brush came in the
mermaid cat not sure if you can buy them
singly but I love love these brushes
everyone always asks me if they're good
and they're so good that they're not
just pretty they're actually really good
so as for contouring I'm quite lucky
because when I put my lips together like
this I can see where my cheekbones are
so obviously it gives me an easier guide
to go ahead and accentuate those
cheekbones so for those of you that
can't see your cheekbones naturally then
I have a little trick that I used to
always do when I was just starting out
and what you're going to want to do is
create an imaginary line from the top of
your ear right to the side of your mouth
so that's where your cheekbone should be
so what I used to do is grab a business
card and place it literally right here
just along the line where I just showed
you but because I don't have that I'm
just going to use this mirror and I'm
just going to line it up from the top of
my ear down to the side of my mouth and
what you're going to want to do is
literally just lightly use that and then
when you take it away can you kind of
see it's already made that contour for
you but because it's going to look
really harsh after you do that just take
any other brush and use that to blend it
all out so lining this up from there
well look how sharp that line is and
then just blending that line out so
there shouldn't be any harsh lines then
I just like to take some just on the
same brush and just put it on the sides
of my nose I'm not a fan of nose
contouring I just feel like it looks so
silly on me so I'm just really lightly
wiping that across the nose and then I'm
just going to go and apply some around
my forehead area then to snatch my draw
I'm going to grab some of that and place
it all the way under if you have a big
double chin that you want to hide make
sure you put the majority of the product
like literally underneath your chin
because then that will create a shadow
and hide it so what I like to do to
clean up the area is just take some more
translucent powder on the Beautyblender
pack on the product and then I'm just
going to wipe this straight underneath
the line that we made so from the top of
my ear all the way to the side of my
mouth and bring it down all the way down
but your face should look something like
this I know it looks crazy now but I
promise after I wipe it off it's going
to look really really nice so while
that's baking I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my face my favorite would have
to be the mary lou manizer by the balm
it's seriously incredible I pretty much
wear it every single day it's amazing so
the whole reason we highlight is to
accentuate our cheekbones if you have
textured skin on your cheekbone less is
more so you're going to want to apply it
literally just on the cheekbone area
that I like to put the littlest bit
above my brow bone because it's all
create like a more lifted kind of look
underneath my brow bone then I like to
put some on my finger and place it on
the tip of my nose this will just also
make the nose appear a little bit more
lifted and then same on the other side
just placing that on the high point of
my cheek
but I like to put some on my Cupid's bow
obviously I like to highlight a full
lipstick so I'm just going to put a
little bit of that on then I'm just
going to brush off the excess powder so
that is how I contour and highlight my
face let me know if you want to see more
