channel so today's video is going to be
an in-depth how true winged liner
tutorial I've had heaps of requests to
do a video like this so for this video I
have teamed up with pony cosmetics to
create this tutorial featuring their new
liquid liner which is called Pegasus it
kind of looks like a Sharpie to me it's
so cool so basically it just has a felt
tip so excited to work with them for
this video because they are such an
amazing company they are Gold Coast base
and of course I love to support local
makeup brands so before I start I
thought I would give you a bit of
information about this product so it
comes out on the 1st of August it's
obviously in the color black it retails
for $29
there is one mill in here and it's only
available online through pony cosmetics
calm a you or they have them in selected
stores and of course pregnant Cosmetics
is cruelty free this product claims to
be water resistant washes off with
cleanser in the shower without leaving
residue on the skin it has a soft felt
tip with a sharp nib tip that allows the
perfect and precise application so what
I like to do my liner I like to do it
quite thick and dramatic that's just the
way that I like to do it on myself I
find that it complements my eye shape
the best so if you would like to learn
how I do my winged liner then keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do is create an imaginary line from the
end of your brow to the end of your eye
so that's where you should be flicking
your wing so what I like to do is I like
to keep my eyes open when I'm doing this
just so I know exactly what the wing is
going to look like with my eyes open I
just kind of look straight ahead
obviously into a mirror
so once you've got your line then I
don't like to go from the very top of
that line I kind of start my wing
probably about here leaving just the
littlest bit of line at the top so you
can really perfect the sharpness of the
end of the wing for them what I like to
do is I like to go here and I pretty
much just work with the pen so what I do
is I just place the pen tip here and
then just go straight down I'm just kind
of connecting the wing when you do this
that you kind of feel it so you just
kind of dip down when you do this step
you'll know what I mean by the whole
following your pen it's super easy once
you've done it a few times
you usually like to do quite sick wings
because I find that they suit my eye
shape the best I'm just going in and
doing the inner corner so now the
majority of the wings done I'm going to
go back into this section and really
sharp up the edge
so that is that wing done it seriously
takes practice to make perfect like
obviously I've been doing makeup for
about four years now and I've always
done wings so it obviously will look
easier than it actually looks but I
promise practice does make perfect and
if you are a beginner then I recommend
using a felt tip liner to start off with
because honestly it is much easier than
using a like a gel pot or even like a
liquid liner in one of those little
bottles it's so much easier to control
and make a really nice wing I'm just
going to shake this product up a bit and
I'm going to try and do the same wing on
the other side so wish me luck because
they never look the same so once again
creating a line then not quite at the
top
so what I mean by following the pen like
when you get to this step you'll know
what I mean once you've done that
obviously you are going to fill it in
and if that happens you wait for it to
dry I was actually kind of hoping that
happens so I can show you guys what to
do if that does happen I'm just going to
fill in the rest of the wing after that
I'm going to go back in so the trick to
cleaning up mistakes is to wait for the
product to completely dry that way when
you go in with your cotton tip it just
flakes right off whereas if you try to
rub it off while it was still wet then
it smear everywhere it would ruin your
eyeshadow and yet just be the biggest
disaster ever trust me a to do it that
way and I'd be like why does this happen
to me so you take your clean cotton tip
and go over the mistake and then to
finish off the look I'm just going in
with the pony cosmetics white knight
mascara if you watch my videos all the
time you know that I use this all the
time especially on my clients it's
amazing so yeah I'm just applying a thin
layer on the top and bottom lashes
so that is the end of the tutorial I
hope you guys enjoyed watching and
learnt something new and if you are
still watching I have a little giveaway
