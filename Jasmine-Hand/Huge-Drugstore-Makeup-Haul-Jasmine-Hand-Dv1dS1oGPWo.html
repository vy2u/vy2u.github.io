channel so today's video is going to be
a good price pharmacy warehouse haul
they recently had a sale on all of their
makeup so I was like okay I need to buy
drugstore makeup because I don't really
have that many like eyeshadow palettes
highlighters from the drugstore for when
I want to do like drugstore makeup
tutorial so I thought this would be the
perfect opportunity for me to pick up
some affordable makeup if you guys are
from Australia probably familiar with
this logo if you're not from Australia
then good price pharmacy warehouse is
just basically like your local drugstore
so you can buy makeup hair care skincare
everything I spent about $200 just
because I wanted to buy some backups of
things that I already love and I wanted
to try it new things so I'm just going
to get straight into the hall so first
up I got the L'Oreal Paris nude magique
cushion juhi glow foundation which looks
like this I've seen all over Instagram
so I was like of course had to try it it
looks like this when you open it up and
it has like a little cushion thing which
actually works I wasn't really keen on
this whole concept cuz I just usually
rather use my Beauty Blender but it
actually did blend the foundation in
quite nicely and then it comes with like
a little pop out thing and that's the
foundation in there it's kind of like
infused in a sponge in there which is
actually a pretty cool idea and I
actually did like the foundation I got
this in the darkest shade I'll leave it
on the screen because I can't remember
and I can't seem to find the color on
the packaging so next up I got the duo
lash glue this is my favorite glue at
the moment the only reason why I've
stopped using the house of lashes 1 is
because the glue clumps on my lashes and
no matter how hard I try and remove the
glue there's always going to be some
residue on my lashes and it kind of
built up too like a thick gluggy
line of lash through nails that I can't
use this anymore as much as I love that
like the formula of it and how it lasts
yeah that just really like effed up my
lashes and of course Gio is way easier
to access here in Australia rather than
you know buying from the American
website or whatever so yeah next up I
picked up my favorite drugstore
foundation at the moment which is the
Maybelline matte and poreless in the
shade 220 I have it on right now it
matches my loving
and fake tan so good next up I picked up
a backup of my favorite gel liner which
is the Maybelline eye studio in black
the other thing I don't like about this
set is the brush that it comes with I
kind of wish it was more of like a
narrow angled brush as you can see the
brush is just like really thick and it's
not even like supposed to be for
eyeliner so I just chucked that straight
in the bin and I just used my sigma
winged liner brush honestly I don't know
if I'll ever find anything better and
affordable as that so yeah that is my
favorite gel liner ever next up I picked
up my favorite concealer of all time the
Maybelline fit me if you watch my videos
you know that this is hands-down my
favorite concealer ever actually if you
have me on snapchat you would have known
that a few days ago
I was on the hunt just to buy one I just
needed one concealer because I was
running out and I literally went to like
six different shops and drugstores and
they were all sold out there wasn't one
in sight until I went to like bullies
basically 20 minutes from where I lived
because I was that desperate for it so
when they had it at good price I was
like oh my god but they only had one but
if they had ten I probably would have
bought ten as well it's literally my
all-time favorite concealer if you
haven't already picked it up go pick it
up it's in the shade light and it just
highlight I got it on today it just
highlights conceals it's amazing I'm
dead so next up I picked up the
Maybelline fit me pressed powder this in
the shade 230 ah I didn't even know that
they had that little like powder puff
thing on the bottom end so it's got like
a little mirror and then you flip it
down and there's the actual powder I do
really like this product it's not as
much coverage as my Austral as fresh and
flawless but it still looks really
really nice on the skin so I'm actually
really glad I took that up so I can use
that in my tutorials you know for
something different I know you guys get
a bit pissed off when I use the same
product so next up I picked up the
L'Oreal Paris single eye shadow in the
shade lemmya 500 and it is incredible I
always I this one off when I'm in the
drugstore but I never get around to
buying it so I thought while it was on
sale I'd better pick it up and it's
seriously so amazed
so if you guys are trying to find a
really affordable gold eyeshadow then I
would highly recommend this one so next
up I got the Revlon Ultra HD matte lip
color and I love this color I really
wanted to get a like a berry purpley
color because I don't really have
anything drugstore this color in my
collection
I haven't actually owned a drugstore
liquid lipstick in a while wait yes I
have the Australis for lips but I
freaking hate them they're so bad
they're so drying they just crack off
your lip so I wanted to try something
else and I love the formula of this I
wouldn't say it's like completely matte
because yeah you can see it like
transfers but I love that it's not matte
but maybe it shouldn't say that it is
matte on the thing but I really love how
it's moisturizing on the lips and how it
feels so yeah I really like this so far
so next up I got the L'Oreal Paris lumi
magique based primer amazing this is a
repurchase because I ran out a couple
months ago and I haven't gotten around
to buying it again but I absolutely love
this product it just makes your face
glow within I don't have it on today
which I should have put it on today so I
could have showed you guys but I
definitely will start to use it in my
tutorial so you can see how amazing it
looks on the skin next up I got this Max
Factor blush in the shade seductive pink
which looks like this it looks like a
marble II sort of design but I don't
have any Max Factor makeup so I thought
I would give it a go and I actually like
it I have it on my cheeks at the moment
it's not true pigmented not too intense
it's got a little sheen to it as well so
it's not like completely matte which is
what I like in a blush I don't really
like matte blushes that much but yeah
I'm actually really enjoying this so
while I was in a can opener the Max
Factor stand I picked up this eyeshadow
palette and those shimmery colors are
what sold me and because I don't really
have any affordable eyeshadow palettes
from the drugstore this is the
masterpiece nude palette and it's in the
color because there was like other
colors Oh - golden noon so that is what
they look like I'll put some swatches on
the screen so you can see so
pretty I'm so excited I'll definitely do
a tutorial with this sorry the next
product is really exciting because I
always try to find drugstore
highlighters and I never find them like
why don't Maybelline Rimmel make just a
simple highlighter in a compact I just
don't get it
but I found a freaking highlight up from
the drugstore it is then dude by Nature
highlighting palette so this is what the
colors look like I have the highlight on
at the moment it's so amazingly
pigmented I like the blush as well I
have that a little bit on my cheeks as
well I haven't actually tried out the
bronzer Shea but that's what the bronzer
shade looks like so next up I got the
Maybelline brow satin it's got two ends
and it really intrigued me when I was
watching it in store this double ended
so the first end is just like the brow
pencil which you can use to like shape
the brow and then on the other side it's
so weird but it's so cool it's got a
cushion but it's filled with powder so I
guess you can shape the brow with that
and then fill it in with this like how
cool so those everything I picked up
from good price pharmacy warehouse I
hope you guys enjoy watching this haul
