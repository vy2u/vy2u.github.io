weekly vlog sorry I didn't get to vlog
last week I just kind of wanted a break
from you know filming everything that I
got up to because I was just really busy
trying to organize my kit and everything
for all my clients on the weekend so I
kind of just filmed that salon vlog
instead I kind of want to make this
video more around my keto diet so I'll
be filming some of my favorite recipes
that I ate throughout the day so yeah I
don't really have that much plan this
week I have a wedding this Sunday which
I'll probably vlog clients in the cellar
on Friday and Saturday and then
throughout the week I'll probably just
be filming sit-down videos and I think
too exciting but I'll make this vlog
mainly about Mikey time what I eat
throughout the days I'm gonna go pick up
a parcel from princess Polly go check my
P o box and yeah but it's what's my P o
box so I thought I would order the new
arm Hidden Hills key glasses is why
one's broke oh my god why do they put
all this shit's like in and out like
some people say I like this style better
than these ones but I'll be the judge of
that
all right do you like this style it does
look very like what are they called like
visor yeah I don't mind them I think I
still do like these ones they look a
little bit more girly I just not sure
about like this bit they're probably the
closest I'll ever get to these so
they'll have to do
Oh real technique oh my god just what I
need that's amazing so I just got that
enhanced I set them advanced I set and
then their blush brush and some beauty
blenders well one Beauty Blender thanks
guys
all right I'm off to do some grocery
shopping for this week's I have no food
I'm fasting till about twelve o'clock
every day so if you guys don't know what
fasting is it's basically where you
don't eat for a certain period of time
so I try and fast for at least like 13
to 16 hours a day
apparently fasting really helps with
Cato's so I've been trying to do that
every day almost days so it says
everything I got from the shops this
isn't a week's worth it's just stuff
that I needed so I just have some five
Filat some meatball for their own sale
make them tonight I found this low carb
and low sugar sauce so I can make
bolognaise with it so I might make
Bolognese and meatballs with zucchini
noodles tonight I got some of my
favorite I'm a milk some tomato sauce
soy sugar I want to try this it is a
salted caramel I'm a milk I might make
my coffee with it now and tell you guys
how I like it
I love these two snaps they're just
roasted seaweed they're so good and
really low in carbs some bacon peanut
butter feta house lettuce for salads
Parmesan cheese
some of my fav Mayo baby spinach egg
whites I wanted to try this coffee
because it's apparently good for you
this teriyaki chicken stir-fry
and these spaghetti things I haven't
tried these I've tried the rice ones and
they're all right they kind of just
tastes like rubber to be honest but it's
low-carb thickened cream and then just
some citric acid and gelatine powder
because I want to make lollies sour
lilies because I saw a video on Facebook
on it oh and some almond milk but yes
that is my groceries for the next couple
days I'm gonna make some of this coffee
that I got today
take a nice person one gram of carbs and
0.7 grams of sugar which is pretty good
this is the brand anything that's bad
about it is it six dollars compared to
like three dollars for just like a
normal one I use this coconut oil a
teaspoon
I use these free-range eggs close as I
use this bacon so I have to suck the
feta I use this one as well it's just a
close friend one it's not that common
but it does okay I'm gonna pour the
salted caramel almond milk
that is so sweet and I put the coffee
that tastes off or the like usually
stuff that is sugar-free have heaps of
sweeteners in it so I just add some imma
kinda like so I can't even taste coffee
and I love the testing oh I have to try
it with umm just normal just finished my
bacon put it on the plate I'm gonna
crack two eggs on here I'm just gonna
leave that there to cook and I like to
sprinkle some feta over the top I really
like how the bottom of the eggs turn out
because of like the fat from the bacon
it kind of turns out really really
crispy and nice so I just pretty much
just let that cook all the way through I
don't turn it over anything but I'll
sprinkle feta on it and then that is
literally it - avocado
two slices of bacon and then true eggs
sunny-side up I'll leave all the macros
and stuff on the screen as well
so I've just added the feta cheese on
top Maggie's decided to cut up free
cherry tomatoes it's on the side I'm
gonna try and make some bacon and egg
cups later I'm just to make like
morning's a bit easier so I don't have
to cook this like every time the coffee
tastes a lot better with the mokona in
it so this is the app that I use to
track all of my macros so it's called
carbon manager this is just another day
and so every day I try to go under 21
grams of carbs I try to stay under 20
actually of net carbs and my total fats
are 129 and 104 of proteins so 21 grams
of carbs and under I'm on 15,000
calories a day and then yeah so you're
going from net carbs not total carbs so
this is what the app is and it just lets
you put in everything so this meal is
four hundred and sixty
calories and it has a total of 4 grams
of net carbs so that's not actually the
I'm a milk that I use it's a different
brand but I put in my almond milk to
russia's of bacon two large eggs feta
and half an avocado and I'll probably
add my little cherry tomatoes but that's
just mainly what the app is it just
keeps you on track so you don't go over
your carbs per day so I'm going to make
some bacon and egg cups so I can have
them for breakfast or probably just have
like two of them so yeah I'm gonna just
make some bacon first is just from the
pan that I use before put like six or so
slices in there cut it up saute some
spinach mix some eggs and cheese
together in this and yeah I will keep
you guys updated there the bacon is
cooking I'm just going to add some egg
white just a little bit this just from
my hello fresh I'm gonna add some shaved
parmesan cheese so now I'm just sauteing
it probably should have like out of the
bacon last so I could like evenly
distribute it between the six things
that's alright
okay so they don't look like a complete
disaster but next time I'd probably put
the bacon in separately so I just added
a cherry tomato on top of each and I'll
put it in the oven probably now probably
for about 10 minutes on 180 just until
the egg cooks so this is how they turned
out I will have some tomorrow for
breakfast I'm just gonna put them in
this container and then pop him in the
fridge
oh my god guys guess what they found
the people that stole my makeup I was
gonna call from the salon owner and the
police called her and they said that
they found
it's a massive white truck at a house in
Mullen diner which is just a suburb on
the Gold Coast filled with makeup nails
stuff crown brushes stuff
like everything is apparently there so
we're going tomorrow to see if it's like
a hundred percent our stuff and I guess
taking whatever's ours but like to be
honest like I don't really want to be
taking back my makeup like I don't know
what the hell they've done with it like
I'll happily take back my ring light and
like my makeup storage and all that
stuff and some pallets at a limited
edition that I cared about but other
than that if it's all unused I'll take
it back but like I don't know if I'll
want to take back all of my used makeup
mmm I don't know yet I'll see but I'll
try and vlog if I'm allowed to so you
guys can see oh my god just cannot
believe they caught them they're gonna
be on the news tonight Channel 9 5
o'clock even though this vlog will be up
after but I'll probably have a clip on
it on my Instagram story after it goes
live on the news but holy I can't
believe it
I kind of lost hope last week because
like it's been about a week and you know
usually stuff like that gets resolved a
bit quicker but I know I just kind of
lost hope and I just I don't know just
thought it'd be gone forever and you
know started fresh I'm glad I've started
fresh though it's just so refreshing to
have all this fresh makeup and like you
know new brushes and stuff to work with
yeah but I'm just really keen to see who
these people are and what they look like
and it'd be really interesting to know
if I've done their makeup before or if I
recognize them so that's what I'm doing
tomorrow I'll vlog it I was gonna film
tomorrow but that's obviously more
important I'm gonna f45 tonight I'll
bring my camera I don't know if I'll end
up filming I might just like set it up
somewhere and show you guys a little
snippet of what f45 is all about so yeah
I'm gonna make some dinner to eat after
yeah I think I'm gonna make those
meatballs and zucchini noodles for
dinner so I'll vlog me making that but I
went to that till after 45 so I will
expect you guys later so I'm gonna make
my dinner before f45 just so I don't
have to cook it when I get home so for
now alright so I'm gonna make these
meatballs really hard to find tomato
sauce for like Bolognese and stuff with
low carbs so this one only has 4 grams
of carbs per serving it has 3 servings
in it and this is definitely like more
than freakin 3 so this probably like 4
servings of meals and there's no sugar
in this I'm thinking I want to put
cheese inside I don't know if that's
gonna turn out to be a fail or not so
let's see how that goes shall we
just like I'm really molding the balls
with the chaise in the middle oh yeah
that kind of worked so they have the
meatballs I did pretty much like 3/4 of
cheese and then a couple planes just for
the Vic if she wants some after I'm
gonna pop the as you can hear those in
the microwave I'm pretty sure this
serves - yup the serves - so I just add
up seeing net carbs for this meal and it
would be around 8 grams of carbs which
is quite a lot for a meal but if you do
have those leftover amount of carbs like
in your macro then you can definitely
eat something like this I usually try
and stay under 5 grams of carbs per meal
just so I can like evenly balance it but
I haven't really had that many carbs
today so eight grams is not going to
like exceed my limit of carbs for the
day it's really hard to explain but I'll
make sure I explain it all in a sit-down
video just all about counting your
macros and stuff because I'm only just
starting to get my head around it but
yeah once you get the hang of it it's so
easy and adding this pin
because that Kim was whole Tomatoes I
just cut them up I just put the
temperature well yeah with the
temperature of the stove down a bit and
just like that simmer for like 10 to 15
minutes
I might season it with some salt and
pepper what else
probably like battle maybe some Italian
herbs some garlic powder in there too
because I didn't add any garlic look how
cool these tights are I got them from a
boutique in Burleigh I'm just so
obsessed and this is cesky collection as
well and just met f45 singlet so I'm off
to f45 and I will see y'all wedding at
home or tomorrow
here is my meatball and zucchini noodle
oh and Pepsi Max because I feel a bit
naughty and it doesn't have any sugar or
carbs hey guys today's the day
today today I'm going to some random
truck and picking up all my makeup that
was stuff it's gonna feel so weird but
yeah apparently um the police raided the
house we're all like the stolen makeup
was and they got a truck and just load
it all the truck so we're going to the
truck now and seeing if like it is
actually ours but I reckon it is because
of Carly there's heaps of that crown
brushes and stuff down at the same
people that robbed us so
yeah bigs gonna try vlog it yeah differ
a lot too but yeah could be like a cross
a mom but yeah we'll see if I can plug
it if not I'll let you guys know after
we ready
[Laughter]
ah no
I never can film but what is that
oh my god what is that your electric
pallet yeah oh my god oh my straw Liz
thank God for all of that seriously I'm
just going through everything now not
everything I have back but I'm just
sorting it out now but yeah I'm so happy
we found who took everything what a days
sorry I look like the biggest mess but
I'm gonna fill you in on what happened
to the cops message cast who's the owner
of the salon so that the cops had found
the house where all the makeup was in I
Renee Hart and Dylan something but I
posted them on my story I'll put a photo
here if you guys want to see they just
look like an innocent young couple they
have a daughter basically what the
police did was they raided their house
with a massive truck and they took
everything that was inside their house
and loaded it on a truck and they've
taken it to a warehouse called up all
the salons that had been robbed and we
all just went today and just picked out
everything that was ours there was so
much there like I was just like I
could not believe it there was a few
acrylic makeup storage things that
weren't there and just like bits and
pieces that were mine that weren't there
we spent maybe like two hours going
through all these boxes because like
there'd be other makeup artist makeup
kit but then there'd be some of my
pellets in there and some of my like
eyeliners or brushes just randomly
scattered in these random boxes so we
had to go through every single box which
took ages and I just put it all in my
car and took it back to the salon so
yeah the robbers I think went to court
today I hope they get locked up but like
the up thing about it is I don't
think they will because she's pregnant
and like that just annoys the out
of me because they do not deserve to get
away with this at all and you know what
the thing about it is like I swear
I've seen this photo before I've seen or
seen her face somewhere I don't think
I've done my makeup because I did go
through a phase
book and like I didn't recognize like
that I did a makeup or anything like
that cuz sometimes I do like to like go
on to my clients profiles or whatever
and just have a look at like photos from
like the events that they've attended
from when I did their makeup so I didn't
really notice any of the photos that I
did a makeup line but like I swear I've
seen that photo somewhere or I've just
seen her head so I'm just like trying to
think where I've seen it or maybe I'm
just imagining things and I think it's
someone else but I'm just so glad that
they got caught and I have the majority
of my stuff back I probably won't be
using the majority of my makeup I'll
probably either give it away or throw it
in the bin just because I don't really
feel comfortable like using makeup that
someone's stolen and like touched I
don't know I'm just wee with that sort
of stuff but obviously I'll keep all of
my unused stuff like all my Mac
foundations and stuff like all my
backups I'll take all them my brushes
I'll give away to my friends and stuff
because I've got all new brushes now but
other than that oh my god what a day I'm
so happy like it's such a relief that I
have all of my there are some pallets
that I couldn't find like in the
warehouse
they're probably still there but I
couldn't like I spent so long there's
just like a few pallets that I was
trying to find but I couldn't yeah so am
i under stage your ones I couldn't find
I think there was like three or four
that I couldn't but other than that the
majority of my stuff was there so thank
god this is going to be an eventful
weekly vlog because I literally didn't
have anything planned this week I was
just gonna go with the flow but yeah so
I'll speak to you guys later
good morning everyone well not really
good morning good afternoon I just
worked this morning just did a princess
Polly hole on my Instagram story I try
to fast for 15 hours so this
miel you know how I made those um quiche
things or latkes things like back in the
neck things I'm gonna have two of those
I'm gonna lie I probably would just
rather like make fresh bacon and eggs
everyday because they I don't know they
didn't taste the best
but that's then I'm gonna put two in the
microwave and I don't even know if I'm
gonna have coffee I'm trying not sure
how coffee like ever since I've started
this diet I've been having coffee like
every day and I never used to so yeah
cut back on that then I'm gonna get my
eyebrows threaded then I need to go pick
up my trouble makeup case that I ordered
so yeah oh my god this jacket is so
comfy I feel like I'm so like late to
the bandwagon getting it except like
everyone has it
it's the ingr pixie jacket I will speak
to you guys later
hey guys so I just got back from f45
and I'm thinking of making some low-carb
enchiladas but instead of wrapping it in
like I don't know if it's like tortilla
I'm gonna use cabbage I saw a recipe on
Facebook so I will I'll try and add like
the little video here so you guys can
see but I'm really intrigued and I have
all the ingredients so may as well cook
it for dinner so I can happen for the
next few days as well my roommates
actually like in the lounge watching a
movie so I probably won't speak
throughout it but I'll make sure I film
all the steps into making the dish so
yeah I'm gonna go and have a shower now
and start making it so enjoy
hi good morning it is Earth Day I need
to get a new camera because this is
munted sorry I woke up early today and
by early I mean 8 o'clock I usually like
wake up at 10 I know it's sorry bad but
I got up early to film a video actually
to video I filmed my boob job update and
a makeup tutorial I haven't had anything
to eat yet I just had a coffee this
morning so I'm gonna make probably gonna
make bacon and eggs to be honest I don't
really like those quiche things that I
made I'll just rather make fresh eggs
and bacon everyday even though it's a
little bit of a mission but oh well I'm
gonna go and get my mom a Mother's Day
present she's always wanted that thing
Gucci belt so I was like it I'm
gonna go and buy it because yeah she
would love it I think I'm gonna go to my
grandma's and visit her and yeah I don't
really have that much plan for the rest
of the day except for that I'm gonna f45
tonight tomorrow I have a few clients so
I'll bring my vlog camera along oh yeah
I'll speak to you guys later just wanted
to give you a quick update on my hair
cuz heaps of you guys have been asking
how it's going to be honest it just
feels like my real hair like just my
hair from my head like it's not heavy
it's not a burden it's it's amazing and
you can't see the band's like I've had
so many compliments on them thinking
that it's my real hair and I'm like no
it's extension so like what the hell it
looks so natural I have had a few
questions asking how I tied up for the
gym though so I'm gonna sit this here Oh
probably not there actually isn't it
here and show you guys how I tied up for
the gym so don't mind my outfit but
basically I just freshly washed
and killed my hat I just put it up in a
low ponytail I use these hair ties to
type my hair so my hair doesn't kink so
this is all I do put it up like that
three times tighten it up a bit and that
is literally what I do when I go to the
gym and you can't see any tapes
whatsoever you can even put it up in a
high pony but I just prefer because my
hair is always down and it always just
sort of sits like this I don't usually
like feel the need to put it up but I'll
show you guys what it looks like up so
that's what it would look like in a high
pony literally cannot see any tapes at
all I just thought I would show you guys
what I would do to my hair when I go to
the gyms I've had some questions I
literally don't know how I lived without
these extensions because they've
literally changed my hair game like I'm
so obsessive good morning it is Friday
today I have a couple of clients in the
salon I will bring my blog camera along
with me other than that I don't have
anything on for the day except I do have
my boob job 3 month update with my
doctor this afternoon not doing anything
tonight because I've work tomorrow
makeup artist live so I'll probably just
like spend the night in editing videos
but yeah my skin is kind of like
clearing up I've absolutely no makeup on
right now like my forehead has like
really cleared up it was really bumpy
before and now it's really smooth thank
God I'm gonna make breakfast now and
then pack my makeup case
oh actually that's what I wanted to do
organize my travel makeup case and then
film a video for you guys because so
many people requested a
what's in my free landscape video so
that is coming to my YouTube so I will
speak to you guys later so I just got to
the salon I'm about to do a bridal trial
and I'll show you guys my kit so far
this is all the stuff that I basically
got back so they're basically all the
pellets that I have left except for a
few over there that was like full before
but I'm not sure if this is in focus on
art I got my new brushes these are the
foundations are typically using my kit
and I'm just packing my kit for our
wedding on Sunday but I'm also gonna
film what I have in my kit as well for
you guys all my storage and stuff is

kind of unpacking everything and just
getting ready for my client so I'll make

because my roommates sleeping I'm off to
do a wedding so I'm thinking of ending
