luggage we came here yesterday but I
literally I just wasn't in the mood to
vlog or anything like that because yeah
the airport lost our luggage it's now
the next day it's 8 a.m. we literally
don't have anything we have a few bits
and pieces like a dress don't even have
short I literally used a singlet as a
skirt yesterday by the pool we have to
go buy bikinis because well we're not
gonna waste a day and I be there just
because we don't have our luggage but
yeah we're here in IB that were in a
hotel we're staying
we're staying like pretty central but um
yeah I literally look like a hot mess I
haven't washed my hair in like three
days but this is the view from our hotel
it's not like that like crash hot or
anything but it's as I said before it's
like central it's like walking distance
to everything but yeah this is our like
little balcony walk in and then there's
just two single beds don't mind the mess
and then you toilet there and then yeah
obviously door yeah we've been like
tracking our luggage pretty much all of
last night and this morning and
apparently it should be delivered to our
hotel in about an hour so thank God it
was so stressed that it wouldn't come
while we're here because we're only here
for three days so yeah for now sorry if
I've been a bit boring
well they I'll definitely vlog when I'm
at one of the boat parties and the clubs
because I'm so excited so yeah
I will talk to you guys when we have our
luggage and I'm in a better mood hey
guys we finally got our luggage where
are we off to what
the couple will surely we're going to
douche Boucherie you know it's a black
of Beach sort of boosha boosha wah it's
like a beach beachy like pool
party club that we had to paint freakin
55 euros or for like four hours
it closes at 12:00 but I'm gonna
they haven't explained it
for have
hey guys so I haven't been vlogging much
cheese yeah we've just been partying so
much I've forgotten to vlog and I kind
of don't want to lose my vlog camera out
because I was actually died but today we
are going to one of those broke parties
that we organized through our hotels so
I am bringing my blog camera selfies
vlogging so much of that I'm just
wearing my new C Foley bikini that I'm
literally obsessed with quite like pie
and I like this
and then just my Abrams short live
princess Foley and Mikey Sonny's I
thought braids would be probably the
best option because we're gonna be like
in water and stuff but we also got these
things we got these are waterproof phone
case things you put it around your neck
and you put your phone in there and you
can use it while you're in the water
because we'll be going on like jet skis
and stuff so yeah so it's excited it is
so humid here but loving it so far so I
will vlog when we get there
I'm so glad we found this Rach it's
super pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
