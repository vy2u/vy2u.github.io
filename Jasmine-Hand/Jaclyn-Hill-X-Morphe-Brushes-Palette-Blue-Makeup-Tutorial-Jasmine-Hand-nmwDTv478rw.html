finally I have another video I've been
so busy lately but I'm so glad I've got
this one up for you guys so first I'm
just starting with brows and I'm using
at the benefit Cabrera in the shade
number 5 I won't go into too much detail
with this because I will be uploading a
brow routine very soon that I'm just
adding some concealer on my eyelids to
prime them and just blending them all
out now I'm taking the Rimmel stay matte
translucent powder and just using that
on top of my eyelids to set them all in
place then I'm going in with the benefit
3d brow tones just to set my eyebrows in
place the eyeshadow palette I you today
it was the new one by Jaclyn hill and
morphe brushes I just showed you guys
some of the swatches because they are
incredible these are definitely much
better than the other
formula of morphia eyeshadows all the
ones that I have anyways there's so much
creamier buttery and they just blend
like a dream so I'm just taking that
first shade really similar to like a
creme brulee sort of type shade so soft
brown and just prune that into my crease
then describing this dark yellow che and
I'm just placing that above the crease
just to blend the transition shade out a
little bit more and I'm taking at this
chocolate brown color and placing that
on the outer corners of the eyes and
then just taking that big blending brush
that we used earlier in the crease just
to blend it all out
but I'm taking the matte black shade as
a palette as well and I'm also working
that into the outer corners of the eyes
and then blending it out again with the
large fluffy brush so I'm just taking a
makeup wipe just to clean up any fallout
from underneath the eyeshadow and then
just to crisp up the edges as well so
I'm just taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light and just
using this as a sort of base for the
blue just so it makes it pop a little
bit more so I'm just using that on a
concealer brush I usually have my eyes
open just so I can map out the crease
and then I go to blend it in through the
outer corner shade then going in with
the most amazing blue ever just on a
flat shader brush and I'm just packing
that blue straight over the top
since the light I'm just taking the
two-faced sketch marker in black and
then just creating a bold thick wing
Sanders taking the benefit roller lash
mascara and just coating my top lashes
in preparation for false lashes the
lashes I'm taking are these the naughty
Beauty lashes and then I'm pretty sure
these ones are in the style called
Zanardi I'll leave their link down below
if you're interested I'm like obsessive
these lashes I bought them like 20 times
they last so well and then yeah I'm just
kind of meshing my real lashes with the
fake ones with the tweezers now into
face I'm taking the Marc Jacobs coconut
primer and just putting that all over
and also the benefit Porefessional I
can't live without this primer it's my
favorite I just mainly work that into
the areas of my face where I have like
the most poor so just near my nose and
on my chin for foundation I'm taking the
Mac Studio Fix
a mixed NC 35 and NC 40 and I mix a
little bit of the Marc Jacobs
illuminator it's one of their new one so
I'll leave the correct name listed down
below just starting up all over my face
first and then just blending it all in
with a makeup brush
for concealer I'm taking the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard and just placing that just
directly underneath my eyes and then I
like to mix in a little bit of my
Maybelline fit me concealer in light and
do the eyes as well and then I like to
use that to highlight the center of my
face
then to set my concealer I'm just taking
the laura mercier translucent powder
just on a damp Beauty Blender and just
pressing that underneath my eyes and to
set the rest of my face and taking the
nas pressed powder in the shade beach
just on a large fluffy brush and yes
just setting the rest of my foundation
and then finishing off the eyes and have
taken the first show that we used in the
crease on the lower lash line just to
smoke it out so I'm taking this gorgeous
vibrant orange shade and just placing
that in the same place as the last color
and just intensifying the lower lash
line a little bit more and then to glam
it up a little bit mom just taking in
mark gold glitter I just use some of the
jewelers flow I couldn't find any
glitter glue so I put that on as a base
and then I just put the matte glitter
straight over the top I think it looks
so pretty I love it then just adding
some mascara to the lower lashes and
then for bronzer I'm taking one of the
new Marc Jacobs coconut bronzers I'll
leave the full name down below for you
guys just on an angled bronzing brush
and just popping that in my cheeks my
forehead down the bridge of my nose and
then a little bit along my jaw as well
and then to Kanto I'm just using the
hoola by benefit and just placing that
in the cheekbone area just with the same
brush
then taking some translucent powder just
to clean up the contour and then for
blush I'm taking one of the new
Anastasio Beverly Hills blush trios or
leave the color in the description box
down below just place my on the apples
of my cheeks then for highlight I'm
taking one of my favs the Laura Geller
gilded honey and I'm just placing that
on actually a really really large eye
shadow blending brush I just really
wanted to concentrate the highlight on
my cheekbone I'm just placing that
underneath my eyebrow as well and then
on my Cupid's bow and then down the
bridge of my nose for lips I'm going in
with the Urban Decay 24-hour glide on
lip pencil in the shade 1995 and then on
top I'm going in with the Anastasia
Beverly Hills stripped liquid lipstick I
was like so tongue-tied for a second and
then on top I'm going in with a new hood
of beauty lip straw lip glosses and this
was in the shade called ritzy and oh my
god it's so glossy and metallic I'm
obsessed
and then to finish up a look I'm just
spraying from the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and that is the
final look done I hope you guys enjoyed
watching learn something new as always
and I'll see you in my next video bye
