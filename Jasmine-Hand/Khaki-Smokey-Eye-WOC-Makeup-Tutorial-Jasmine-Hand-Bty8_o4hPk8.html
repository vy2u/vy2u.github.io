doing this cocky smoky eye that I'm
absolutely obsessed with I'm gonna get
straight into it as always I'm going in
with the Garnier micellar water just to
ensure the face is nice and clean for
the base then for primer I'm using the
that gal primer by benefit cosmetics she
said that she had slightly like drier
skin so that's why I use this because
it's a brightening primer so it'll make
her face look nice and gooey
then to color correct the darkness
around her eyes and lips I'm going in
with the LA girl Pro concealer in the
orange color and as you can see I'm just
placing that underneath her eyes and
then blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender
you
dentist's foundation I'm going in with
the Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC 45 I know
it looks really really light when I
first applied on the skin but it does
blend out to match her skin color so I
like to just place it all over her face
first with a concealer brush and then
blend it all out with a damp Beauty
Blender
you
and it to conceal and highlight her face
I'm using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 25 medium and for
reference I use the light so that one's
at the top and I just decided to add the
other colors in there as well so you can
see what kind of color it is in
comparison to the one that I use so I
just placed that underneath her eyes in
a upside-down triangle and then just
blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender
you
then going in with the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills medium to tan contour kit
and I'm taking the shade peaches and
cream which is on the top row in the
middle it's just a really peachy sort of
highlighting color so I'm using that to
set her under-eye area before I bake
then I'm just baking her under-eye area
using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder just on my reborn large
highlighter brush and yet just packing
that underneath her eyes
then taking the anasazi Beverly Hills
Pro brow palette I use his on literally
all of my clients I'm taking a dark
brown and I'm just using that on my pony
cosmetics eyebrow brush and just filling
in her brow
she has amazing full brows to begin with
so I didn't really need to do much so
I'm just going really light handed with
this
then just using that same concealer just
to carve out her browsers in the shade
at 25 medium again and then I'm just
blending that concealer out with just a
small kabuki style brush I think I got
this one from eBay and then to set the
rest of our face I'm using the
Australia's fresh and flawless face
powder in the darkest shade I believe
and it's called medium tan
so the bronze I'm using the Mac give me
Sun I feel like I can only wear this
when I'm really tan so I'm guessing it
suits more darker skin tones so yeah I
decided to use this one today and it
really really worked like I really liked
how it turned out
I tried to use different products in
this video so you guys can get a variety
instead of just me using the same old
crap so yeah I'm just applying that with
my mac 135 brush applying that to the
hollows of her cheekbones around her jaw
and forehead area then going in with the
Anasazi Beverly Hills medium to tan
contour kit again and I'm grabbing
Havana just down the bottom in the
middle it doesn't look as dark in real
life I'm I don't know that photo must
just look dark and I'm just contouring
her face just with my spectrum Cosmetics
angled brush
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder again and I'm just
using that on that same it be blender to
bake her contour
but I showed today I figured I'd use all
makeup geek eyeshadows just so it's
easier so I'm first going in with frappe
I've shown a picture on the left just in
comparison to the other shades that I
typically use on other clients as well
so you guys can see like the difference
in color or whatever so I'm grabbing
frappe and I'm just using that in her
crease as her transition shade and then
I go in with Coco bear and I'm using
that to really deepen up the crease and
I'm loving ready oranjee tones in the
crease lately and I just thought it went
well with the khaki green that we're
going to put in the lid well on the lid
not in the lid then going in with makeup
geeks Venom single eyeshadow I've just
spread my brush with a bit of fix past
before just to intensify the pigment and
I'm just packing that all over the
mobile lid
then taking makeup geeks corrupt which
say Matt black I'm just using that on my
Mac to 1-7 brush and just placing that
in the outer corners of her eyes and
blending it out
then first up I'm taking Coco bear to
smoke out the lower lash line I'm just
using this as a transition shade for the
lower lash line then I go in with
corrupt which is by makeup geek and I'm
just using that on a tapered zoeva brush
I'll leave brushes listed down below as
always and also using that true smoke
out her lower lash line then I'm using
the Maybelline eye studio gel liner in
black and lining her waterline then
taking corrupt again I'm using that to
smoke out that liner that we put in her
waterline just now just because it's
still wet as it can it transfer so I
like to use that to really smoke it out
it really does make the biggest
difference then to highlight her inner
corners I'm using Mac's soft and gentle
such a stunning color and yeah it's like
my favorite highlighter at the moment
senthil ina I'm using the taught clay
paint liner in black just on one of my
zoeva winged liner brushes and creating
a small wing
you
the lashes I used Stella rose by model
rock lashes are actually double layered
they are so amazing and I just stuck
them on with the duo lash glue
then for blush I'm taking the hot mama
by the balm cosmetics I love this blush
so much it's so shimmery and it just
makes the face look so glowy and perfect
then
for highlighter I'm using an old
favorite which is so Hollywood by
Anastasia Beverly Hills just on her
highlighting brush and just highlighting
the high points of her face
Philips we kind of improvised that
didn't have a dark enough liner so I
went in with the makeup geek spectrum
liner this was in dark brown and then I
went over it with the lip liner by dried
cosmetics just to make it a little bit
lighter because I feel like it was a bit
dark just the brown by itself and then
the lipstick I used was well by Mac and
then I just used a clear lip gloss over
top
and then to finish off the look I'm
setting her face to the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed
watching I had heaps of requests to do a
makeup tutorial on a woman with color so
I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I
did
please give it a thumbs up if you did
and I'll see you in my next video bye
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
