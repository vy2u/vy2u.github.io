so today's video is going to be a review
slash demo type video on the Kylie
cosmetics birthday bundle which was
limited edition for her birthday I was
really hesitant when I bought this
because I was that I don't know if I
want to spend like two hundred and fifty
dollars on I don't need but I was
like okay I'm gonna do it for the video
but I really wanted just to sit down and
chat and try the products for the first
time on camera I wasn't going to upload
it on to YouTube so I feel like the hype
is kind of over now but I really wanted
to buy this birthday model for myself so
I thought may as well film a video while
I have it so if you would like to see
how I created this eye look and then
swatches of all three lip products in
this bundle then keep on watching I
thought I'd include my base just at the
side of the video for those wondering so
I just used the Smashbox photo finish
primer water and then for foundation I'm
using the Marc Jacobs remarkable it's
super yellow when it first goes on but
then it oxidizes and like sinks into
your skin and kind of goes neutral like
it doesn't look this bad once it's all
like sunken into your skin it's so weird
but I love this foundation so much I
probably should pick up a shade kind of
lighter and not so yellow but I did buy
it online so I couldn't swatch it first
then for brows and using the anastasia
beverly hills dipbrow in the shade soft
brown and i'm just using that on my pony
cosmetics eyebrow brush
say that it feels right
and taking the Maybelline master conceal
concealer in the shade 20 light I'm
pretty sure so not the lighter shade and
I'm just using that to carve out my
brows and then I go ahead and use that
to conceal my under eye area I really
really like this concealer it's pretty
comparable to the fit me the only thing
I don't like about it is it comes in a
tube which is just super annoying I just
rather the DOE foot application but it's
definitely on par with the fit me it's
got great coverage and I love the color
I don't call them back let me see you
hold it down we gonna have a blast I
just want to know what you're gonna do
with color that ain't got a sale where
you can have it off watch me rip it off
and taking the RCM a @no color powder
I've actually put it in a empty face of
Australia translucent powder like
packaging just because it's so much
easier to use that way and just placing
that underneath my eyes then going in
with the Australia's fresh and flawless
face powder in medium tan and setting
the rest of my face and then just
lightly brushing off the excess powder
from the bake then for bronze I'm going
in with my one of my favourites at the
moment actually which is the Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer it looks really
shimmery in the pan but it comes out on
the skin really beautifully and then to
contour I'm using the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil this is the milk
chocolate no yeah the middle one I can't
remember I'll leave everything listed
down below anyways then going in with
the Australia's banana powder I've
really been loving sweeping this unsaved
my eyes after baking I don't know I just
feel like it really brightens up the
eyes and then on my lazy days I like to
use it underneath my contour just to
define it a bit more it works really
well and it's super cheap as well I'm
definitely gonna have to pick one up for
my kit and then for blush I'm using the
NARS orgasm and just placing that on my
cheeks and sweeping that up through my
temples and then for highlighter i'm
using the jeffree star cosmetics King
Tut it's amazing and just applying that
on my cheekbones Cupid's bow bridge of
my nose and yeah pretty much everywhere
cuz I'm obsessed with it so now that I
look crazy and my base is done I'm gonna
go ahead and try out all of the eye and
lip products from the Kylie cosmetics
birthday bundle so everything came in
this little black bag which just zips up
at the top so the first thing that was
in the bundle was her makeup case that
was sixty Australian dollars I would say
it's definitely not worth $60 like this
is probably the most expensive makeup
case I own but it's kind of cute and I
probably will use it so inside you get
the mini mat which has exposed Dolce K
cocoa cake candy Kate and Kristen I
didn't even realize that
Christian's in it and I think that's Leo
but doesn't say that on the back oh my
god I really wanted to actually buy
Kristin because I love that color they
are so tiny I don't know why I expected
them to be bigger but this is a
comparison to my hand and I have really
small hands so yeah it's really small it
only I think has 0.65 mils in here so
yeah I don't know I think they'll just
be handy for when you're going out just
to put in your purse you don't have to
cut around one of the big liquid
lipsticks but I think the idea of this
is really cute and I definitely will use
them then it also comes with true cream
eyeshadows I actually used rose gold on
shiny in my previous video if you want
to check it out so I won't put this on
today but it's seriously the most
stunning rose gold cream eyeshadow I'm
obsessed with it so today I think I'll
use the copper one on my eyes so you
guys can see this is what the packaging
looks like on the creme shadow just has
a gold lid it's really similar to the
Anastasio dipbrow packaging like they're
really heavy and then next up her gold
medal liquid lipstick this one's in the
shade Lord looks like this everything's
all gold again I'm not sure how wearable
this is going to be but I'll try it on
and we'll soon find out and then her
poppin gloss which is also a gold shade
I think this one will be definitely
wearable it looks so so pretty so I'm so
excited to try that one on and lastly
one of the other things that I'm really
excited to try is the Chi liner this is
in the dark bronze color so it comes
with the actual eyeliner pod which looks
like this also comes with a liner which
is cool for the waterline and then it
also comes with a brush oh yeah it could
be better it's probably like not the
best for eyeliner it's actually really
thick I'll try it though and see how I
like it I'm going to start with
eyeshadow I'm just going to go in with
some of my makeup geek eyeshadows I'm
going to use creme brulee and I'm just
going to use that in the crease as a
transition shade first and then I'll pop
the copper on the lid so this looks
going to be fairly neutral I just really
want to test out what that cop
shade is going to look like okay now
taking the cream eyeshadow in copper so
I'm going to pack that all over my lid
the formula of these are amazing they're
super creamy and easy to apply and
really pigmented so I'm going to pop
that like look at that it is so nice
alright so that's on my lid now I'm
going to try and blend that into the
crease so just going in with Morocco by
anastasia beverly hills and i'm just
going to use that kind of in the crease
and add a corner area
I'm going to test out the dark bronze
kyle ina and i'm going to attempt to use
it on the brush that it came with this
brush is this brush is so hard to
use no this color is really gorgeous and
its really soft as well um so if you're
not like much of an eyeliner person this
brown shades so nice like it's really
really shimmery
okay it's like God hates with glitter
throw it it's so weird
really do you like the formula of this
liner but next time I probably wouldn't
do a wing I would just try and keep it
on my lash line I'm really interested to
see how the pencil goes so I'm going to
take that and put it in my waterline
okay so it's not as pigmented as I
thought it would be but it's still
really nice if you're wanting like a
soft glam I just realized most of
Kylie's makeup looks a really glam but
they're so soft like the colors that she
uses are not harsh I actually kind of
like that now that I'm looking in the
mirror because it looks like I have
something in my waterline but it's not
too harsh
very very weirdly impressed I'm not
usually into these kinds of colors on my
eyes I never use Browns in my waterline
never use brown eyeliner so yeah I
actually really really like it so I'm
going to put on some lashes and mascara
and I'll come back and swatch some of
the lip colors on my lips so that the
lashes are on I'm wearing a Koko lashes
Queen B again because I'm obsessed I
can't get enough of them I'm going to go
in with poppin gloss first I'm just
going to use exposed to line my lips so
that is poppin gloss on really really
like it I'm keen to see what it's going
to look like over the top of a nude
lipstick so that is poppin now I'm going
to put on Lord which is one of the
metals which is going to be like I'm
thinking just like straight up gold lips
but we'll see in a second and align my
lips again with exposed
so that is what Lord looks like on I
really really like it surprisingly I
probably wouldn't be game enough to wear
it like out in public it's definitely
like a festival type lip like in my
opinion but yeah that is what the Lord
metal looks like today I'm going to
swatch the Kristin matte liquid
lipsticks I haven't watched it yet oh
that is so nice so this is Kristin on
absolutely obsessed with dusty dark pink
shades and I tried so quickly when I
quickly wipe this off before it dries
completely uh I was too late
holy look like horrendous things
lastly I'm gonna swatch Leo I'm so
excited for the shade yay
my god
this is Leo on and it's definitely one
of my favorite colors out of all of her
matte liquid lipsticks it went on so
easily it's so pigmented and oh my god
like I'm just dead so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this little demo and review
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys say that it feels right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
