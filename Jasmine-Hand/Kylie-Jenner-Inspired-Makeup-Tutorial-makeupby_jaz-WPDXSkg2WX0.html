I'm starting off with the model crow
face face primer it's definitely one of
my favorite drugstore friends of all
time
it's silicon based and makes my
foundation look amazing so if the
foundation I decided to use the L'Oreal
Paris Pro matte foundation the new one
because Kylie always had such a flawless
face so I'm in the color 30 honey which
is pretty dark because I have a fake ten
obviously and I'm just buffing that in
with my debt Beauty Blender I really
love the coverage and the look of this
foundation on my skin for my early skin
I found that it starts here oily after
like five to six hours but other than
that it is an amazing foundation
and now I'm just taking some of the
instant age rewind concealer by
Maybelline and this is in the shade
medium I'm pretty sure and I'm just
going over my blemishes just so I have a
little bit more coverage and then using
the Maybelline loonie touch concealer
it's kind of like a concealer and a
highlighter all in one I'm because Kylie
always so highlighted and just oh she's
so amazing I can't get over it but as
you can see I've kind of speeded up my
face because I've done this in so many
of my videos so I just decided to speed
up all of this stuff and focus mainly on
the eyes so as you can see I'm just
highlighting under my eyes down the
bridge of my nose I've been on my
forehead on my chin and I'm a Cupid's
bow and then just blending it out with
my Beauty Blender so I'm using the Kat
Von D shade + light color I'm using the
banana shade and just setting those
concealed areas and then I'm going in
with my favorite setting powder which is
the Australia's fresh and flawless and
this is the color dark brown and then
I'm just studying the rest of my
foundation
the bronzer I'm using the bomb desert
bronzer and I'm just using that on an
angled brush and just putting that on my
cheeks on my forehead on my jawline and
underneath my lip
so now I'm taking my new favorite
contouring powder by Brodey or cosmetics
and it's in the shade at zero three and
I'm just contouring my cheekbones and my
nose
welcome
and then as per usual I'm baking my face
with the face of Australia translucent
powder I get so many questions from
people asking what I bake with and this
is what I bake with I don't because
anything else about this powder if you
want to know how I bake like in depth I
have other videos on that site yeah so
now I'm just lightly filling in my brows
because I don't really need to because
I've gotten them tattooed so I'm just
kind of defining the starts and the
arches of my brows and then I'm just
brushing off the excess translucent
powder and then I decided to like go in
and fake some more because I find that
she always like has her contour
connected to the sides of her mouth kind
of so as you can see I'm gonna do that
after I brush this off
and then to prep the eyes I'm just going
in with a light concealer and blending
that all in and then I'm setting it with
just a white / translucent powder I
can't remember the one I use I probably
use the one from the Kat Von D shade and
light palette but setting your eyes is
so important because it makes the eye
shadow go on so seamlessly so for blush
I'm using these so Susan Rose chiffon
blush because in the photo it looks like
Kylie has like nice rosy flushed cheeks
and then for highlighter and using the
Barnett Metis cause it was a messy mary
loumanizer
and obviously highlighting the highest
points of my face so down the bridge of
my nose on my cheekbones my Cupid's bow
a little bit above my brows on my chin
and then a little bit on my forehead
because she just looked like a glowing
goddess okay now for eyes and taking
creme Brule from makeup geek and
slapping that into my crease and then
I'm taking a shimmery pink eyeshadow
this one's from Steph and makeup and
it's the princess palette but any pink
shimmery eyeshadow will do it and I'm
just like kind of putting that all over
my lid and then a little bit on my
crease because it kind of looks like
purpley pink and then I'm taking pink
champagne by anastacio Beverly Hills
wetting my brush and packing that all
over my lid because her lid looks really
sparkly and then I'm just taking a
little bit of that pink and then
blending it all in and then I was taking
a matte black eyeshadow and using that
to smudge on my upper lashline because
it looks like there is something there
but she definitely doesn't have eyeliner
and then I'm just smudging that all in
so I'm just taking this pink bas lip
liner and lining my waterline and then
I'm just grabbing the balm nude eyeliner
and then just kind of blending it out
because it doesn't look like she has
like a pink eyeliner but there's
something new deep inky in there so
that's what I decided to go for now just
grabbing this shimmery lilac II sort of
shade for my teaching Cosmetics palette
and I'm just running that on my lower
lash line and then curling my lashes and
then coating my lashes with this essence
mascara this one's amazing new together
if you don't have it and then for lashes
I've stacked the LA mink T's and the I'm
pretty sure that work are up 48 lashes
I'll have them down below anyways but
then I decided to highlight my brow bone
and my inner corner because I forgot so
I'm just popping them on and then
because Kali has like five mil lip
injections I'm using my full lips
enhancer thingamabob to give my lips a
little bit of a plumpness and then I'm
going in with dried cosmetics serenity
Hydra matte liquid lipstick oh my god I
don't usually like light pink lipsticks
but this is life like I absolutely love
this color on my skin tone so I have
some discount codes if you're interested
in buying these but yeah this is the
finished look thank you guys so much for
