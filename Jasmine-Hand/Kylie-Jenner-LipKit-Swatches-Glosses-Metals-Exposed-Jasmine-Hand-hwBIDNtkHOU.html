channel so today's video is going to be
part 2 of my Kylie lip kit swatches I
recently picked up all of the metals the
glosses and also exposed and Khayyam
majesty
I don't know if my Majesty is in with
the metals but I just wanted I'd mention
it anyway I've got it on my lips now and
it's seriously the coolest color ever so
first up I want just to talk about the
formula and the applicators of the
Middle's in comparison to the matte
liquid lipsticks I don't know about you
guys but my applicator on the Middle's a
really really furry as soon as I post
that picture of my new color lip kit on
Instagram I got a ton of comments saying
oh my god go and check your medals
because apparently everyone's is
half-empty so I was like okay and I did
and they definitely weren't wrong I
actually emailed customer service about
the medals being half empty just cuz I
wanted to see what they had to say back
and they pretty much replied within the
hour and this is what they have to say
they said hello jasmine I apologize for
the confusion our metallic matte liquid
lipsticks have a different consistency
to our regular matte lipsticks these
lipsticks have more of a mousse-like
texture as opposed to the liquid
consistency like the maps because of the
thicker consistency this product can
appear to move within the vial please
know this is completely normal and it is
not a defect or an indication of missing
product as your product is not defective
we cannot issue any replacements we
apologize for any inconvenience but your
products are safe to you so apparently
they're made like that because of the
consistency yeah I hope that answered
some questions in regards to the metals
but I'm going to stop rambling and get
straight into the swatches I hope you
guys enjoy watching this video and if
you did don't forget to give it a thumbs
up for me and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
