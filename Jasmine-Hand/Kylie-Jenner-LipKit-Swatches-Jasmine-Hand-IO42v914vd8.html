so today is a very very very exciting
video because I just received the new
Kylie Jenner lip kits and I was like oh
my god I have to do a swatch video
straight away so that is what I did but
at the moment she's actually got seven
shades but I ordered these before her
new 22 shade came out I think yesterday
so I've only got the shades true brown
kay mary jo k Posie K Koko K doll Chi K
and Kandy K so I only have six to swatch
for you guys and also I have a little
giveaway so make sure you stay tuned to
the end of the video to see how to enter
so I thought I'd give you guys a little
fast impression sort of review before I
get into the swatches or the liquid
lipsticks so basically if you guys have
tried the Australis 4 law lips I don't
really like them in my opinion but the
texture of those kind of remind me of
these they go I'm kind of like creamy
and it's definitely not like a
water-based liquid lipstick like the
lime chrome one it's kind of like like a
thick creamy consistency goes on
amazingly the only one that I found
quite patchy was this one I have to go
over it twice but otherwise all of the
pigmentation on the other ones are
amazing as the lasting power I only had
these liquid lipsticks on for about five
minutes each after I put them on I went
off camera and took a few selfies as I
do and it literally was the biggest
bitch to remove I had to use like oil
and a little bit of the Garnier micellar
water on my baby white and it came off
pretty easy with that so yeah I
definitely couldn't just remove them
with a plain baby white because it just
didn't budge at all so yeah it did come
off when I put a bit of olive oil and a
little bit of the guy named Miss Ella
water it came off and I kind of like
flaked off thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to give this video
a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
comment below what your favorite color
was I'm going to get straight on to the
swatches and I'll see you in my next
video bye
you
you
you
you
you
so the people still watching I'm going
to be hosting a giveaway on my Instagram
account I was going to give all six to
one person but I asked you guys on
snapchat if you'd rather that or if
you'd rather six winners win one color
each and the majority said that they
would rather six winners so I'm going to
do it that way so all you have to do is
screenshot this photo here I'll have it
on my Instagram as well if that's easier
share it on your page tag me and hashtag
jazz lip kit only one entry per person
just to avoid like spearmen cats and
stuff like that you have to be on public
so I can see your entry yes this
giveaway is international and I'm going
to be picking the winner in two weeks
from now so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
