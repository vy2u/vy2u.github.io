so in today's video I'm going to take
you with me to get my lips done and by
that I mean lip fillers I've been to
sing out once before and I absolutely
loved the outcome so I'm going back
again for a little top up the actual lip
fillers itself lasts up to 18 months
like they're still in my lips
I still have noticeable fillers but
obviously as time goes on they're not
permanent so they do deflate a little
bit and I just want them just a little
bit bigger so I'm just going to go in
and probably get half a meal the first
time I went I only got a meal I'll
insert a picture here of the before and
after that I posted on my Instagram page
just finished my makeup I don't have
anything on my lips obviously and it
feels so weird to have a full person
either one and not have any lipstick on
but I'll put someone after and show you
what my lips look like anyways but I'm
just going to give you a zoom up I'll
probably show you guys when I'm there
like a before and after as well but just
so you can see now so you can definitely
tell that the top lip still has fill in
its just the bottom lip that isn't as
noticeable as the top lip but I think
it's just because of the angle that I'm
holding the camera that it looks big
because like if I hold it up like this
it doesn't look as big so yeah I hope
you guys enjoy it don't forget to give
it a thumbs up if you did and I'll see
you in the clinic
also in there when people put needles
into engine lips it can be very painful
even though there's some local in the
product it's still nice to relax and not
feel uncomfortable okay okay so I'm just
going to pop a little bit of disclose $4
this is so it'll be painless when I have
free
do your walk pace max that's an added
advantage isn't
because many people have all the big
fear of having this done because of the
pain mm-hmm so we want to minimize that
as much as possible so we're just going
to let that settle in
right there don't mm-hmm shouldn't be
too uncomfortable
and the very fact that you really
nervous and don't like pain is a good
idea to have a block yeah
I always said that you'll feel like Mick
Jagger in a few minutes what it does it
does doesn't feel like my whole face is
why not yes but it's not you can see
nothing has changed so I'm sweating
oh okay then we're going to be popping
some in the bottom so I think it's
really important that you're nice and on
there as well okay just
okay then
so on a scale of one to 10 do you think
it's too torturous not maybe or three
that's three because you're nervous
because you are
so this is actually a nerve block and a
nerve block is specifically aimed at
numbing this particular area okay
Billy Gunn
give me now good num hmm I think Kurt's
here thank you party
so good luck only lasts about 15 to 20
minutes yeah
I'll just go she just put the perfect
area it'll be to make up there isn't it
she's just a bit makeup artist in
Australia yeah
she's famous issues killa gosh she's
killing it she's gonna be bigger than
been hers she already is
she's killing it okay so relax for me
now lovely okay so just relax a size
perfect border here
because we want nauseous lips yeah
it's not painful little not popular
thing thank God when your number comes
great
get some good angles mmm
that's so good so close
is going in to give that nice beautiful
border
sometimes it can be a little bit
uncomfortable here hopefully it's not
beautiful
my swap sides
especially in the corners
yeah that roll out there
hey guys so I just got home and this is
what my lips look like if it's going to
focus I absolutely love them if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave
them in the comments below and I'll
answer them all hope you guys enjoyed
