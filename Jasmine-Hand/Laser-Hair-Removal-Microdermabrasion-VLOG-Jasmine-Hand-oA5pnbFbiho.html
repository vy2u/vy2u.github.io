vlog episodes of vlogging recently
although I'm just up I'm on my
way today to Australian skin clinics to
get my laser hair removal done I'm a had
it done for the first time about 4 weeks
ago so I'm going in for my second
treatment and are also getting a skin
treatment called microdermabrasion as
well and there's different types of like
skin treatments so they all also I guess
it's just going to like evaluate my skin
and do whichever one it's best suited
for my skin type I have have hit the
breakout frequently so hopefully I can
get one that can treat that but yeah I
thought I would take you guys along with
me and show you like the process of the
laser hair removal because I'll try to
find videos on YouTube before I went in
because I was really scared to
additionally do the treatment because
obviously I'm a with pain and I
just really wanted to see like what was
the procedure was like so I couldn't
really find any good YouTube if I
thought I would make one to help some of
you guys now that are thinking of
getting it done I go to the Australian
Skin Clinic at Rabine the town centre
which is like five minutes from my house
which is so convenient
and yeah I'm going to bring my little
camera along and hopefully someone's
going to help me fill the procedure
how the china rap
hey guys so I thought I'd give you guys
a little update on my skin so it's now
been exactly two weeks since my
microdermabrasion and this is what my
skin is looking like I still have a
little bit of redness around here but
all of my breakouts around here I have
completely gone thankfully I still do
have like a little bit of bumps and sort
of texture around here but hopefully
because I'm going back again today it's
going to hopefully help that a little
bit more yeah I thought I would show you
guys the progress of my skin and I hope
you guys enjoyed this style of log don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
