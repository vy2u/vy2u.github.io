I'm starting off with the benefit cut
brow in the shade at number three to use
to fill in her brows i'm just using the
pony cosmetics eyebrow brush it's what i
use all the time and yeah just starting
off at the tail and then just slowly
going in through the side of the brow
just feathering it really lightly just
to create a really natural gradient brow
then was taking some concealer the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
just using that to define the tops and
the bottoms of the brow
and then I'm just blending that
concealer in
then I'm taking the Benefit Cosmetics 3d
brow tones in the show number three as
well and just running that through her
brows just to set them in place then
taking the Rimmel stay matte translucent
powder I'm just using that true except
the eyelids just throw the eyeshadow
blends a lot more seamlessly
for eyeshadow I'm taking the hooter
Beauty rose gold eyeshadow palette this
is literally one of my faves are using
the sell one all the time I'm just
taking that bottom right transition
color and pretty much just placing that
ball over her eyelid
you
then I'm taking the red shade called
maneater and pretty much placing that in
the same places and just really smoking
that out
then I'm taking this color pop supernova
shock cream eyeshadow I'm not sure of
the name but I'll make sure I look it up
online and leave it listed down below
but it's just a gorgeous shimmery copper
color and I've pretty much just place
that all over her lid
now at a base I'm taking the tart drink
of h2o gel moisturizer and just popping
that all over her face this is so
hydrating especially if you want that
Julie's skin look I love this
moisturizer for that then I'm taking the
iconic London illuminator drops and just
popping that on the highest point of her
cheeks I just like to do this before and
also after foundation just to get that
extra Juhi sort of look so I'm just
popping that on her cheekbones Cupid's
bow and down the bridge of her nose and
just blending it in with a damp Beauty
Blender
then I'm taking some mac fix+ just to
prep her face before foundation and the
foundation I used was a mixture of two
shades of the NARS
all day weightless foundation I don't
know it's a new one I'll leave the full
name was down below I can never get the
names of foundations right there so long
these days I'm but I mixed Punjab and a
bit of Barcelona just to get her exact
shade I only pretty much just put like
probably half a squirt on her face
because I did want a really really light
to medium coverage just because I didn't
want to cover up her gorgeous freckles
because I wanted a more of a luminous
light base for this look so I'm just
blending that in it with a damp Beauty
Blender then going in with a Maybelline
fit me concealer in the shade at 20 and
just putting three dots just below her
eyes and blending that all him
then was taking some laura mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to set her concealer underneath her eyes
so it doesn't crease then going on to
finishing off the lower lash line I'm
just taking the first transition color
that we used with the Hilda Beauty a
rose gold palette and just smudging that
on her lower lash line and then I go
ahead to take man-eater as well and also
smoking that out on our lower lash line
as well
then I'm taking the Australis metallic
scream I shudder this is what I used to
the inner corners all the time and I'm
just yeah placing them on the inner
corners and then I go in with an urban
decay single eyeshadow in the shade of
polyester bride just over the top just
to set them so it doesn't move
and then I'm just applying some mascara
to a bottom lashes
then I'm taking the Maybelline eye
studio at gel liner and just popping
that in her waterline just to create a
little bit more of a dramatic look I
remember when we first sighted I was
like I want to do something a bit more
natural neck minute this always happens
then I'm taking my fav bronzer the true
face sweetheart one and just using that
to bronze up her face
then taking the haul up bronze up by
benefit just true at contour her face I
just like to use the brush that it came
with
I feel like it chisels out the jaw lines
really really well so I'm just using
that
then taking the huda beauty 3d
highlighter palette I'm taking that
blush shade and popping that on the
apples of her cheeks just because this
blush is more of like a glowy one and I
really wanted to emphasize the luminous
skin so I'm just popping that on her
cheeks and then for highlighter I'm
taking the top right color and popping
that on the highest points of her face
then I'm taking my favorite lip gloss
the Marc Jacobs lip gloss in the shade
sugar sugar I literally use this on like
all my clients and like every single
tutorial so I should probably change it
up and try and find something different
but I'm like obsessed with this glass
popping it on our lips and then to set
our face I'm taking the glam glow glow
set up setting spray one of my new fave
and popping that on and that is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed
watching don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you'd like to see more
client tutorials and I'll see you next
time bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
