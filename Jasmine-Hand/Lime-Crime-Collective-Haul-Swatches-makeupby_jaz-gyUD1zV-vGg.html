swatching is suede berry I'm going to
use only flying off okay I'm just going
to line my lips are just like a nude
collage because I don't really have like
a fine black lip line so I'm just going
to do that really quickly
so what I like to use to apply my
Velveteen x' with the lip brush I take
some product and kind of line the
outside of my lips with it

go in with the applicator

these yet but they came in the most
amazing packaging holy
so I also got a glitter helper as well I
can find it so I'm just going to swatch
these with the glitter helper so it's
just like a white sort of consistency
and now I'm just going to be applying
them each with a flat shadow brush

I'm actually wearing it on my eyes at
the moment so I'm going to be swatching
every single color on my arm and I'm
going to be using this eye shadow right
now for one of the swatches of each
color just so you can see
how much brighter it is okay so as you
can see all the colors on the right of
each other have the eyeshadow bright now

eyeshadow brighten have made the color
mousse mousse or moon so much brighter
than it is without it shell with the
eyeshadow bright night and that's
without it
