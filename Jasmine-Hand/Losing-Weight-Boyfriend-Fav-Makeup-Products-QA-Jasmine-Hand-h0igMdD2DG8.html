so today I decided to do a QA because I
haven't done one in probably about six
months and I thought I was due for one
so asked you guys on Instagram to send
me through some questions so I've got
198 comments I did actually ask you guys
like like the comments you'd most want
me to answer so I'm just going to go all
the way to the top and just pretty much
answer the ones that have the most likes
okay so this one's I plan on likes from
Tyra Forman and she asks what's one
product you couldn't live without I
would probably have to say mascara or I
don't know mascara or bronzer I
literally like can't leave the house
without wearing masks I like if I'm not
wearing makeup I have to put mascara on
because I feel like I don't know I don't
really have like nice natural lashes I
know yeah I would have to say mascara
yeah mascara Caitlyn Hamilton asks what
is your go-to meal to cook well I'm
actually on a little bit of like a fit
though fitness journey so basically like
all I'm having is like two meal
replacement shakes and then for lunch I
have like clean chicken breast with
veggies and avocado and that's literally
it and I just sprinkle some lemon on it
and that's basically all I'm eating at
the moment I've actually lost in total
eight kilos since last December which is
amazing and I noticed you guys have
noticed as well like when I see comments
I'm like yes I love when people notice
but yeah that's pretty much all I'm
eating at the moment until I'm at my
target weight my motivation is Europe I
actually booked another Europe tour I
leave at the end of July I'm going
through tomorrow and with my friend oh
my god so excited then we're going to
Ibiza and then we're doing a 33-day
Europe can take you to our I'm so
excited so that's like my motivation
because I want to look good in a bikini
do you prefer loving tan or bond o
stands for self-tanning so at the moment
I have blonde i stands on a seed loving
ten I see Sunday
since when I was in high school and I
remember really liking it and then I
started to use loving pan and then I was
like oh wow this sounds really good and
then I don't know I kind of just like
switched it up so now I use bond ace and
I think I would prefer by my fans as
it's a little bit darker and I like how
it's more of a yellowy sort of base
under time whereas the loving pen I find
sometimes can come out a little bit
pinky gray undertone II I don't know but
I do like them both but at the moment
I'm using a Bondi stands ultra dark
mousse and I'm loving it and at Alinea
27 asks what qualifications do I have in
makeup zero I haven't ever been to
makeup school I'm a hunt descent
self-taught I just taught myself here on
YouTube just like you guys are watching
my videos and learning so yes that's
basically how I learned I think I've
only really had one client asked me what
qualifications do I have and after I
said I don't actually have any I'm
self-taught though like oh wow that's
amazing that's fun that didn't really
like follow them at all so yeah how did
you grow your hair so long and do you
have any tips from as long as I remember
I've always had long hair except for
when I was in grade five and I got head
lice
so mum was like I am literally not
running a comb through your hair because
my hair break down to my ass so she
chopped it all off to my shoulders and
then did the last treatment and
apparently it was way way way easier so
ever since then I've always had long
hair I don't know I just get it cut
regularly I go to the hairdresser's
maybe once every six to eight weeks I
get a cut in color and treatment I know
it's weird to think that if you get
regular cuts your hair will grow but it
actually does I've noticed a massive
change every time I go to the
hairdresser's when I get a cut it just
looks healthier
it does actually grow faster I don't
really use heat on my hair that often
only if I'm going out on weekends or if
I'm filming I would blow dry and
straighten it but otherwise during the
week I literally don't touch my hair me
no beauty and I ask where I see myself
in five years love you love you too in
five years I will be homie I'm so good
at math
I'm 20 24 25 26 27 28 when I'm 28
hopefully have a partner I don't have a
boyfriend for those that are asking
George or Alex aren't my boyfriends they
are both very day I know they're not
seeing each other we're all best friends
I am single but yeah hopefully both 28 I
have a partner a boyfriend I don't know
I don't really want to get married until
I'm about 30 I still want to travel the
world and through heaps of things for
myself sir hopefully make my own makeup
line I've seriously looked into it
because I'm really keen to go down that
path but there is a lot of time and
effort to make your own makeup product
hopefully by the time I'm 28 I'll have
something out of my own I don't know
could be makeup lashes a lipstick I
don't know I want to have something of
my own that I create what is my favorite
high-end eyeshadow palette you know what
I think I would have to say the hood is
really one because every single time I
use it I'm just like wow my eyeshadow
looks amazing they are so pigmented easy
to blend I love the colors amazing yeah
I would have to say right now that one
is my favorite I'm going to do more
tutorials with it actually yeah
Shay got Louis asked my skincare tip so
right now I'm using spoons to choose I
hope that's not too loud to pluck
juicing vegetables um I'm using skins to
treat so I use their glycolic acid um
exfoliator and then cleanse up and that
is pretty much all I use but I even
sometimes forget to moisturize because
ain't nobody got time for that
but when I do I use the Dana one the one
in the green tub when I can remember but
that's literally all I use on my skin I
find the less I do to my skin the less
breakouts I get I know that's weird
but like whenever I for example like to
a fake life and I put a toner on and do
all my cleansing and I put like a serum
on and under-eye cream I like wake up
with a pimple and on the side what was
the point in that
so I kind of figured out that the less I
do and the less I touch to my skin the
better for me I don't know how that's
supposed to work but it does for me
so underscore Jones asked what's my Holy
Grail foundation at the moment I love
the Stila one oh my god I really want to
buy some of those for my pet
love Too Faced Born This Way so I'm just
like looking on my foundations i love
the marc jacobs remarkable i couldn't
just use it on its own so I just like to
dot it over like if I'm using like the
Born This Way just to add extra coverage
I really love the Maybelline fit me for
everyday um what else
and the Giorgio Armani luminous silk one
but I needed a different color because I
wanted to go to pink but they're
probably like my top foundation at the
moment Monique Jane asks how did you
become friends with other influences was
it difficult to build your makeup
business on social media what made you
decide to do YouTube how will you
suggest about going and connecting with
other influences and makeup artists for
collaborations and genuine friendship
that's a really good question when I
first started this whole YouTube and
Instagram social media thing I was
 nervous I was that type of person
that would rather break that ankle to go
to the hospital instead of doing my
speech at school or doing some sort of
exercise that I was the center of
attention like I hated being center of
attention I didn't want a eyes on me I
was like no no no I hated that so it was
really hard for me to gain the
confidence to share my passion with the
world
pretty much I remember my first few
videos I was nervous as I was
shaking like I was absolutely terrified
but I knew if I wanted to potentially
get somewhere I had to do it I'd watched
YouTube figures and I'd always think to
myself one day I just want to make a
video and just see what happens and I
did and this is what happened I remember
the exact day I'm message or damned
Britney Britney Saunders on Instagram
because I'd watched her videos for years
and I loved her and I was like you know
what I'm just going to message
this bitch and see if she replies to me
I think she had around I don't know
maybe like five hundred thousand
subscribers but I had maybe like five
thousand or something I wasn't really
into the whole YouTube yet I know if I
messaged her like these two photos of us
two together because we always get
comments saying that we look like
sisters or twins and I found these two
photos and we pretty much had our hair
and makeup the same we had like the same
sort of top line I was like lawful we
apparently look alive how weird
is this and we just got chatting and
yeah probably we've been chatting for
like a month and then she having visited
me for the first time here on the Gold
Coast
we filmed some videos and ever since
then we've been really good friends so
if you want to get in touch with a
influence our YouTube are that you feel
like you can relate to just message them
someone messaged me and they seemed cool
and I don't know genuine I would
probably reply so yeah I think I
answered the majority of those questions
that was a really really long answer
sorry but I'm going to get on to the
next one next question comes from
general Warner makeup and to us how I
edit my videos for Instagram and what
camera do I use so I use a Canon 70d
which is amazing I used to have the
canon 600d didn't autofocus or what I
had to do was like position myself and
then hold down the button to focus it
and if I like moved out of frame like
see how I'm like movie and it's focusing
automatically it wouldn't focus
automatically and it did my absolute
cadence I was like okay I need to
upgrade so I've got the 70d I use iMovie
to edit I've tried Final Cut Pro but
that just absolutely does my head in
because it's so complicated whereas
iMovie is so simple and then yeah that's
all I use for my Instagram videos and my
youtube videos iMovie that's all yes
mirela
ass must have brushes for eye makeup
okay so my fave brushes I really like
this one by rebonds oh it's just a
really really large fluffy brush but
most companies make brushes similar to
this I don't know I just really like a
large one too
really gets the transition color blended
okay what am I saying
this one's also by Reid one that said
concealer brush for carving the brow and
cutting the crease also really like this
one from Revlon it's just a really
narrow brush for underneath the eyes to
smoke out the lower lash line I really
like this brush by uh Nastasia Beverly
Hills it's called swish and it's just
like a fine liner brush I know this
isn't fine makeup and this is the brush
that I use for brows it's the pony
cosmetics one I love it
but yeah that's basically it I just use
a whole lot of large fluffy brushes and
then for the outer corners I didn't
mention that one I do like this one also
by rebonds
so let's go us one Sunday to the birth
of your life which would it be
you're an inspiration thank you that's
like really hard our Mowgli the Stiller
one I'm like obsessed with it for some
reason I don't know it's just so
flawless when I put it on so yeah I
would have to say this Stila stay all
day foundation how do you avoid dry skin
underneath your foundation so I
something from oily skin so I probably
am NOT the best person to ask but if I
have a client and I ask if I have dry
oily and they say they have dry skin I
make sure I moisturize underneath the
primer then I prime and then I would
spray with six plus or a setting spray
and that just kind of makes the
foundation look really really really
dewy and it doesn't look dry at all and
then even if you still find that your
skin is dry after the foundation is set
spray your face again because that's not
going to really interfere it with the
foundation especially if you're just
using like six plus or a setting spray
so yeah try that see if that works if
not then maybe are someone that has like
drier skin but it usually does work for
me and my clients are dry skin so makeup
fine ask what is honestly the best
concealers and powders that don't have
splashbacks both drugstore and high-end
need help
so the concealers that I found
personally that haven't had any
flashback use the Maybelline fit me
never had a problem with that NARS
radiant creamy concealer doesn't have
flash back either does the Urban Decay
line as for setting powders I find that
the RCM a no color powder kinda has a
bit of flashback so I don't like to use
that often but the laura mercier
translucent powder best powder ever no
flashback at all perfecting face powders
I haven't had any problems with the
Australis brush and forth as you fifty
years I use it on my clients as well and
the photos that I take of my clients
after is always flash oh yeah none of
the
products that I use I just mentioned
have flashback so I hope that helps
Kimberly sir I hope I pronounced that
right if your mum parent supportive of
your YouTube saying and what is the
downside of being on YouTube love you
love you too I first started this whole
YouTube thing I don't think she thought
people actually like could make an
income from YouTube so I know she
probably just thought it was just a
phase for me but she's always been so
supportive of my passion for makeup
she's always thought I was amazing at
makeup even when I was 15 and absolutely
terrible now that I look back at the
photos but I think she did get I don't
know not angry but when I have finished
my nursing degree and I told I didn't
want to pursue that career I wanted to
see how my makeup and YouTube turned out
she was a little bit disappointed and
she still to this day want me to keep my
nursing registration so I still pay
every year to keep that up just in case
something falls back but I think she was
a little bit bummed that I didn't go
down the nursing path it's because
obviously as a parent that's a more
secure job than what I'm doing at the
moment but I really wanted to follow my
dreams and I'm so glad that now she is
really supportive of what I'm doing and
yeah I'm really really happy that she is
supporting me now the downside of
YouTube I would have to say is just
being alone during the week talking to
you and also talking to yourself is bad
but not a very interactive job my job on
Finance days where I work from the salon
and do clients I love I love doing that
because obviously I get to meet new
people and paint faces and it's fun but
it's really hard sometimes to go and be
like okay I'm going to film three videos
today I'm going to do this this this and
this and then you get down your site I
can't be bothered to get up and wash my
hair and but it's all worth it in the
end so yeah that's probably one of the
downsides is trying to motivate yourself
to film a video because I know you can
only see me here
for glam with my marble background but
if you guys saw what is in front of me
right now you would be like what the
 it's pretty horrific it's really
really dirty action you clean that but
freaking I love YouTube I'm so glad I'm
on it I'm so glad I continue to make
videos because yeah without you guys I
wouldn't be able to do this as a job so
yes I think that is enough of me
rambling I'm getting a sweaty lip
because it is so hot in here
I hope you guys enjoyed this little chit
chatting video and if you want to see
more to a nays on my channel then let me
know in the comments below because I'll
make them more frequently I love these
kinds of videos because I don't feel
like I'm doing anything I'm just like
talking to myself anyways I think I'm
going insane but yeah thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
