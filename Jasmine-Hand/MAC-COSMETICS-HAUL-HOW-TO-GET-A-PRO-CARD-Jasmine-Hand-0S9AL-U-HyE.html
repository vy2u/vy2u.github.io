so I recently just received my Mac Pro
membership
finally after like a year of trying to
sort out how I'm going to apply
I finally actually got accepted I will
let you know how I applied and what I
needed to supply to apply at the end of
the video so if you want to know how to
apply especially if you're a freelance
self taught makeup artist with no
qualifications they make sure you tune
in to the end of the video because I'll
let you know how but I'm going to get
straight on to my haul I pick up six
hundred dollars worth of makeup no it
would be way more than that because
that's with the discount so probably
nine hundred dollars worth of makeup
right here so I'm just going to get
straight into it and start off with the
lipsticks so the first tip stick I
picked up is called impassioned and it
is in the amplified formula and it is
just the most gorgeous Coralie
bright pink shade I cannot wait to wear
this in summer it's definitely a color
right up my alley and I'm obsessed with
it so the next color I got is fo many of
you guys suggested this on my recent
Instagram photo so I decided to pick it
up it's just a sort of darker version
than velvet teddy which is what I love
in lipsticks I love dark nude so any
dark nudes i will love the next one i
picked up was the famous ruby woo which
is in the formula
matte and as you can see it's just a
gorgeous matte blue based red color i
don't really have anything like this in
my mac lipstick collection so i decided
to pick that one up and the next color I
got is kind of sexy and it is in the
formula masked and when I swatches on my
hand I fell in love with the color it's
kind of like a burnt orange e nude
similar to velvet teddy but a little bit
more
pinkier so hard to explain but it just
looks amazing so that is why I picked
that one up and then I got myth which is
the lightest color I believe in the
whole MAC lipstick collection I wouldn't
dare to wear this by itself on my lips
but I definitely would wear it with like
a nude lip liner all over and then just
dab this in the middle or something but
I mainly just pick this up to create
like ombre lips like I have it in the
center of my lips today and I have brave
on so I think it looks really really
nice and I'm really excited to create
some ombre lips with that one and then a
couple of days ago I got brave which is
here which is what I'm wearing on my
lips now it is a repurchase because the
one that I had originally got stolen out
of my bag when I was clubbing so I had
to pick it up again because it's
definitely one of my favorite shades
ever up and by the way the lipsticks
came down true $25 and 26 this is your
Scout which is pretty damn good
so the next two products that I picked
up with lip liners so I got them in the
shade stone and Ruby woo I just really
needed a good quality red um lip liner
so that's why I picked it up and
everyone raised about stone so that is
why I also picked that one up and then I
got the all raved about soft ochre pay
pot so basically it's just a eyes shadow
base I actually put it on today and I
really like it it doesn't really work
that much better than just putting
concealer on then setting it with like a
translucent powder or whatever but I
don't know I just wanted to give it
because everyone had it of course so
next up I picked up some strobe cream
and this one is just in the travel size
30 mil version um the guy said I need to
grab it if I don't already have it and
I've never tried it so I don't know I
may as well give it a go I have heaps of
illuminating liquid highlighters I
really really love using my model Co one
and the dried cosmetics one so hopefully
this one is up to
standards if not higher so yeah that's
why I picked that one up and then I
decided to get two of the mini size
pigments so I picked up the blue brown
pigment and the vanilla pigment I didn't
want to pick up the full size versions
because I don't think I'll ever go
through these like they're still quite
large for pigments like pigments aren't
really used for like everyday use so
these ones came down to $12 60 so that's
why I picked that one up oh and by the
way the stroke cream came to 1050 and
the soft ochre Paint Pot came down to 24
50 so next up I got the pro longwear
concealer in my shade so I got NW 25 he
actually matched me to NW 25 but I've
previously been matched to NC 35 so I
don't know but it seems like a pretty
good match and I basically just wanted
to pick this one up for covering my
blemishes but yeah I don't really have
like a high-end blemish sort of
concealer so this one came down to
$22.40 and lastly I picked up six shades
of foundations and these are pretty much
for my kit I picked up two of the
lightest shades NC 15 and NW 10 they
look like that and then I got NC 35
which is apparently one of the most
popular shades and then I got n C 45
which just looks like that and then NW
45 and NW 55 which just looked like that
and I didn't come for pumps the pumps
were actually 5 billa's 60 extra so and
of course I bought one pump short
knowing me and lastly I picked up the
Mac two one seven blending brush I've
heard so many things about it and I
thought while I have this discount that
I would pick it up and I bought it for
$25.90 so hopefully that brush is good
that is just a waste of $25 so now I
guess you guys want to know how to apply
so basically I've been trying to get a
hold of this card probably about a year
now ever since I started freelancing but
since I'm not a qualified makeup artist
you do have to provide more proof sort
of thing in order to get the card so
basically there's a list of what you
need to provide to of so there was stuff
such as a business card a professional
website composite card union card I
don't even know that is a professional
reference editorial pictures um can't
remember what else but yeah just a long
list of things if you weren't qualified
you have to provide two of them and if
you were qualified all you'd have to do
is just give them your license I guess
and the diploma certificate so what I
decided to supply it was my business
card so it basically just sets makeup I
just freelance makeup artist gorko is
Australia my number my email and my
social media and then just some shitty
iPhoto that I found on the Internet so I
got these made at visa print com it's
super easy to make one of these things
on that website shipping is so fast and
they're pretty affordable as well so
then I researched what a corporate card
was because I didn't know what it was
and all it basically is is a bigger
version of a business card with client
photos I don't know that's what it said
so I decided to make one of these up on
visa print as well I didn't actually
type in corporate cards for them I think
they're just oversized postcards but
I'll leave the links down below anyways
so basically I just put my logo some
client before it afters my name
freelance makeup artist contact details
and then on the back I just have some
more client photos and then a picture of
myself and then I have jasmine hair and
freelance makeup artist so I said these
true in along with the application and a
copy of my license
the
front and back of it and within a day I
got approved and within three days my
payment was approved so basically you
have to pay sixty dollars a year for
this membership so on the application
like you have to put in your card
details and whatever and then about a
week after that I got this in the mail
so it basically just came with a letter
and your receipt from my membership and
letter just basically said hey jasmine
welcome to the Mac Pro membership
program your card will take four to six
weeks but in the meantime you can use
your thirty percent off discount just by
providing the sales people with this so
that's what I did if you guys have any
questions or if you need help applying
don't hesitate to message me on snapchat
on my Twitter I'll leave them down below
or probably on the screen somewhere I
hope you guys enjoyed this haul and if
you'd like to see more of these kinds of
videos and let me know give it a thumbs
up and I will see you in my next video
bye guys so my next draw is definitely
one of my faves it's just got some of my
liquid lipstick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
