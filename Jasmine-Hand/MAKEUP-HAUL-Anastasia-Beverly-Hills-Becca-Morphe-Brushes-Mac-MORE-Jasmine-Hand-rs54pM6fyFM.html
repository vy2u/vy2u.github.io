so in today's video I decided to film a
massive makeup haul because I've
accumulated quite a few makeup products
in the past couple weeks so I thought
why not share it here with you guys
sorry I haven't been uploading as much
as I planned but I've just finished my
university degree so I definitely now do
have time to film the way more videos
for you guys so without any further ado
I'm just gonna get straight into it so a
couple days ago I paid a visit to Mac
Pro and I got the new centered fixed
pluses i've got cucumber embrose because
these are the only ones that work in
stock to be honest this one smells like
baby wipes and this one actually does
smell like rose water I'm gonna squirt
some to be honest I think I like the
original fix+
likes it better I mainly just pick them
up because they are limited edition and
they look pretty so yeah so also from
Mac I got the boldly banned lip liner
which is just a nude color and then of
course I've got the lipstick in world
everyone's been raving about this since
it's been released and I just think it's
the most amazing color so obviously you
have to pick that one up and then lastly
from Mac I just picked up their brush
cleaner because I've just heard many
people say that it's good so yeah
tech stuff I have some products from
Anastasia Beverly Hills now I seriously
still die every time she likes a photo
of mine on Instagram I don't know why I
just think it's the biggest privilege to
have my photos liked by her because she
is such an amazing woman I was very very
very privileged to have her new
illuminators and sent out to me so I
have them in the colors Riviera which is
a really gorgeous coppery color and then
I have starlight which is - it is just a
white gold highlighter and then I have
peach nectar which is what the name
suggests is just a peachy color and then
my favorite which is called
so Hollywood and it is just a gold
highlighter and then she sent me
highlighting brush which did in the
style ain't to three and I absolutely
love this brush I've been using it ever
since I got it and then they sent me
their new cream contour kids this one is
in fair and it looks like this as you
guys already know I'm not really into
cream contouring but I'm thinking of
making a tutorial feature and then so
let me know if you would like to see
tutorial with me using these down below
so yeah they look like that and this one
is in light and they look like that next
up is the morphe brushes 3/5 Oh palette
if you haven't already seen what's
inside this is what it looks like is so
damn amazing actually used it on my eyes
today and I filmed this makeup tutorial
so probably be up soon but yeah I got
this because why the not so going
on to the theme of eyeshadow palettes I
also picked up the BH Cosmetics Kali
Bible palette and it looks like this I
actually haven't gotten around to using
it yet but I'm gonna swatch some of the
shades oh wow they're the highlighting
shades and this that's actually really
nice and those two the eyeshadows let me
know if you would like to see a tutorial
with that palette because I will
definitely film that for you guys first
up is some goodies from Gerard cosmetics
that recently just came out with the new
lipsticks in the color Maitai which is a
really really vibrant orange color and
the other lipstick is called
kiss-and-tell
which is a more of a muted fuchsia pink
like a duck pink color I don't have
anything like it in my collection
actually and then I ran we just sent me
a black and white lip gloss I don't know
how or when I'm going to use it but
let's have a look I guess I could use
the white to like make other lip glosses
lighter or something but I definitely
can't see myself just you know rocking
white and black lip gloss oh here's
another
Nastasia beverly hills product this
wasn't sent to me I actually bought it
just for my kit it's just a contour kit
but for medium to tan to be honest three
of the colors I probably won't ever use
it was just basically for these two
colors for clients with darker skin so I
thought I would have darker contour
shades for that because I don't have
anything like it in my collection so
that is why I picked that one up so next
up is this top Cosmetics pin-up girl
blush palette I actually bought this
second hand from a girl from makeup
marketplace on Facebook I really really
wanted this when I was in Sephora but
when I was in Sydney at the time they
didn't have any more in stock so I
bought it second hand I actually haven't
gotten around to using it yet but I
think I'm gonna use it in my next
tutorial because all the colors look
amazeballs Jenek stuff is the Becca
cosmetics shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone it is the liquid one and I use
this to mix in with my foundation I've
been using this every time I do my
makeup and I absolutely love the glow
that it gives to my face so yeah I
really really love this one so next up
is the Laura Mercier translucent powder
I am actually so obsessive this I've
kind of abandoned in my face of
Australia translucent powder for this
because this legitimately feels like
silk on my face I use this to set back
on the right areas and it just it just
blends and just seeps into my skin and
just makes the under eye area I feel
like silk so next up I have some stuff
from benefit and this is the air patrol
BB cream eyelid primer which is pretty
interesting it kind of looks like a
cushion
I only just received this yesterday
actually so I haven't used it yet oh
it's kind of like yellow I'm gonna have
to try that one out cuz I can't really
tell if it's a good product just by
putting it on my hand but yeah so this
is the air patrol baby cream eyelid
primer and then I got the benefit
they're real limited
miss Barrett with Shroff's key shot
swarovski s' works more and then i have
the benefit they're real mascara which
is limited-edition and it has Swarovski
crystals on the top of it and it looks
amazing and I want to open it yet
because I have so many mascaras opened
but yeah so that includes my makeup haul
I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
and comment down below if you'd like to
see more hauls on my channel and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
