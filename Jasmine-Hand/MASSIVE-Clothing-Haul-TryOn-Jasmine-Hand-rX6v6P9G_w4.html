you guys exactly what I got and then
I'll probably do like a little split
screen so you can see what it looks like
on so before you guys ask in the
comments yes I did a film of this makeup
look I thought because this video is
going to be based around festival style
outfits I thought I would do a makeup
tutorial it's a little bit out there so
before I saw I just want to quickly
mention that princess Polly gave me a 20
percent off discount code I'll leave it
on the screen I think it's just love
jars and that'll give you 20% off
everything online okay so the first
thing I picked up was this really really
cute red jumpsuit it is so cute and I
thought it would look amazing for when
I'm in Greece so it's just like a short
play suit I'm literally obsessed with
red at the moment like every time I look
at something in the shops that's right
I'm like I need it it's right I love it
so this is the first Junction I got and
it's in a size 10 so the second thing I
got was just a plain offends crop top I
like to work with my denim skirt or
shorts and I like to tie up the front
because it's a bit long I've been on the
hunt for cute tops for Europe so I
thought this one was really cute on then
I got this burnt orange crop as well
which I think would look amazing with
jeans or even a skirt or shorts so yeah
I just needed heaps of really cute
little crops for Europe so the next
thing I got was this mesh crop top and
it's long sleeve as well I just thought
it would look really really cute like
over the top of a bralette
so I did also get this white brother
it's so pretty on so that is what it
looks like this one's innocent
as 12 and this top is in a size medium
so before I forget I'm going to show you
this dress so this is probably one of my
favorites out of the lot it's just a
really loose sort of slip dress and you
can dress it up with a belt so this is
also from princess Holly and yet you
just put it around your waist just to
give it a little bit more show you next
thing I got is just a denim jacket this
one's in a size 12 I'll try it on for
you
it fits really nice actually warm
weekend just a plain sort of whitewashed
okay so my favorite I am I think from
the whole entire haul would have to be
this amazing jumpsuit that I think I'm
gonna wear to one of the days at
Tomorrowland it's super different which
is why I loved it because it's not
something that you would typically wear
every day like with my outfits for
Tomorrowland I wanted to pick outfits
that you know yeah I wouldn't usually
wear it is a black jumpsuit with floral
detailing at the waist and it's got long
sleeves and then it's got the floral
detailing on the end of the sleeves and
then it just goes into some shorts and
then at the back it's just a zip you
can't really see it properly here it
looks way better on I'm so keen to wear
this to tomorrow I'm not sure if I'm
gonna use the belt or not because I
think the belt and the floral might like
clash but I really like the belt so I
don't know yet then next I just got some
short I needed some so I just watched
these ones and then just have frills on
the bottoms this one is in a size 10 and
because I'm probably gonna be living in
short to bottom in Europe I decide to
pick up these ones these are the a brand
Jean was and they have little rips on
the end and love these are so so
fluttering and they're doing the size 10
as well and then I have to pick up a
skirt and I've been literally living in
this denim skirt this is what it looks
like and it's in a size 10 but it does
stretch so it's probably stretched like
a whole size so I'm definitely gonna
we're a belt because does become like
throughout the day when you wear it does
become a bit loose so yeah definitely
recommend a belt or maybe going down to
size but yeah I kind of wish I got an 8
so it's stretched to a 10 but it still
it still looks really good on the next
up I got is probably one of my favorite
tops that I picked up it's just this
bright orange sort of tie up top at the
area you'll see a better when I try it
on but this one's in a size 10 and I'm
so excited to wear it actually did post
a photo on snapchat the other day with
the white roller underneath and it
looked really good and I was thinking
maybe I'll wear it to one of the days of
Tomorrowland because there's three days
so I need three different outfits and I
really love how this looked like on so
yeah one of my favorite tops and then
because I'm obsessed with red I had to
pick up this Wrangler red my suit just
looks like this could go with anything
but I think red and denim looks really
good together so I'll probably be
wearing this with my denim shorts or my
denim so I needed some really really
comfy and good quality boots for
Tomorrowland and I found these ones
online I was like yes done so these ones
are the rock boots they're so
comfortable and yeah they look really
really good with all the outfits so I
thought I'd pick them off because yeah
we can't really go wrong with playing a
black boots and then I just decided to
pick up this really cute little bag that
I can take to Tomorrowland and probably
take it around to Europe with me as well
love it it's just black with gold for
the stunts and detailing and yeah it's
just got a few little slots for like
money and cards and then obviously like
your phone and whatever you I don't even
know what I was gonna say just then but
yeah I love this back so the true sony's
and i picked out with these ones they're
by desi i'm sure you can all over
Instagram but I just think that these
would look so cool with some of the
outfits so I picked up those ones and
then I had to pick up one of Kylie's new
collabs with Kay as well really really
wanted to
really small right ones I tried them on
and I was like like I just did not suit
me at all then I just decide to pick out
some any ideas
these ones I have got like maybe blue
sort of reflex to it I'm sure you'll see
it better I would have try them on in
the try on bit but yeah I love these and
obsessive aviators so and you I would
love them so I didn't pick up another
denim to scout this one's just a black
one I don't have one and it looked
really cute on the model this one's in a
size 10 as well this one is different
material than the blue one this one's
more firm so it doesn't stretch as much
yeah I really really like this so I
actually forgot to mention this showing
up all the clothes video so this is a
tents good it's kind of like that is it
velvety or like yes ready it's waiting
sort of material and yeah but I quickly
put this in because
laughter oh I'm not gonna sit down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
