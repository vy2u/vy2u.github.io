today's video is a collab with ride
Comden au which basically is an online
store that stops haircare skincare and
makeup so I have picked up quite a few
things that I would like to show you
guys so I'm just gonna get straight
ahead and get started so first up I
picked up the cloud9 straightener this
is honestly hands-down the best trainer
I've ever used in my life I don't know
why I didn't get it soon up but it
literally shits on GHD and those vs
saloon and Remington straighteners I've
had don't straighten is my whole life
ever since this has been in my life it
has literally changed my hair game it
straightens so well the one thing I love
about this strainer is that you can
adjust the heat just here so it goes
from 100 to 200 degrees I always keep it
on 200 but I always make sure to put a
heat protectant in just to protect my
hair from any damage so yeah if you're
willing to spend I think this one was
about 270 dollars if you're willing to
spend money on a good straightener I
would HIGHLY highly recommend the cloud9
range you also get your little clips
with it as well which makes
straightening hair a lot easier sure
next up I've got the Geoffrey start
velour liquid lipstick in celebrity skin
I already have this color but I'm almost
out is seriously an amazing nude I'll
swatch it there that is what it looks
like it is amazing I love the formula of
their liquid lipsticks as well so that
is why I decided to pick up another one
so next up I picked up another one of
the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour Mac
foundations this one is in the shade 30
honey and I use this when I'm tan is one
of my favorite actually no it is my
favorite drugstore foundation at the
moment I actually use this more than my
high-end ones because I just feel like
it lasts and just looks amazing on my
skin so that is why I picked another one
of those ones up right then I picked up
the balm Bahama
mama bronze up which looks like this
I've heard great things about it I've
heard people rave about it
that's a swatch there on my hands I
absolutely love the bomb and I don't
have this and now I do and I'm so
excited so next up I picked up this skin
the navier--
makeup finishing spray I've also heard
really good things about this brand and
their finishing spray it's oil free and
paraben free I'm so excited to use it
and I'll keep you guys updated whether I
like it or not so next up I got the
L'Oreal Paris brow artist plumper I've
heard he's a beauty gurus especially
chanock so right about this I got it in
the shade medium to dark because I have
dark eyebrows and so basically it has
little fibers in it to make your
eyebrows appear thicker so I'm really
really excited to try that one out so
next up I picked up a pair of lashes and
these are by model rock I use model rock
lashes on my client so I'm just looking
for other styles that I can use this one
is in the style pinup angel I'm pretty
sure yep
pinup angel and they're really similar
to the ones that I use but they're just
a little bit more lifted like the other
ones that I use are a bit flat against
the eyelid but these ones look a little
bit more lifted so I want to try these
ones out see if I liked them better so
yeah next time I picked up this Evo love
touch shine spray and it says this
bottle contains 498 silicon split ending
pruning frizz reducing nightmare ending
curl defining confidence-building
glamour finding mists of glorious
sunshine bringing serum I'm guessing
this is something to do with her yes
brand your hair gonna do it now oh I
took an oil oh that feels so nice and it
smells amazing I'm so glad I got this
I'm definitely gonna be using this
because I have really really bad split
ends because I'm a blonde but hopefully
this is gonna help I'm so excited to try
this yeah so next up I got the LA girl
flat finish pigment gloss I've never
heard of these before but I got the
color that's really really similar to
Posie K by the Kylie lip kit so I'll
just give you a swatch here so it looks
like that I actually do have the lip
kits on its way so I'm planning on doing
like a swatch video I'll whip this one
out when i'm swatching to see how close
the colors are because I'm pretty sure
this is only a couple of dollars
compared to the ridiculous price of the
Kylie lip kit but this is what the color
looks like it's so sunny it's like
in-between a purple and a pink
absolutely love it next up I picked up
the a.s.a.p be super complex radiance
and clarity serum it just says to apply
to face and neck in the morning so
increases skin hydration and helps
visibly reduce signs of aging which I
will need pace up so next up I picked up
the L'Oreal telescopic mascara I've
heard so many people rave about this and
I was like okay this is my time to try
it so that is why I picked it up
everyone's raving about it I need to try
it obviously next is another Evo product
it is the water killer dry shampoo yes
it says like a flavor that turns into a
bed or a water finding stick that you
can just throw to your qatal this two in
one dry shampoo and styling powder will
literally make a day use it and be
someone I'm going to give it a go I love
dry shampoo this smells expensive this
was so nice see dry shampoos are
honestly my Savior I don't wash my hair
every day I wash it every second day and
everything that I use a dry shampoo so
I'll definitely definitely be using this
so thank you I hope I have the tan
Tunisia or tanto tanto
tennisia self-tanner and bronze are
which looks like this oh my god it
smells like those Jaffa lilies you know
those round red like really hard balls
all my cons y'all okay so apparently you
squeezed some into the palm of your
hands moved into one section at a time
until the product is absorbed okay well
that is that and I will definitely try
that one out so the final product I got
is the alpha H liquid gold with glycolic
acid I'm pretty sure this is a toner so
it says apply liquid gold onto cleansed
skin each alternate evening moisten with
a cotton pad with solution and applied
to your face and decolletage glycolic
acid is really good for people with acne
prone skin so yeah if you're looking for
a toner that is good for acne prone skin
then I'd probably recommend this this
alpha C vitamin C with grapes seeds
applied two to three drops each morning
onto the cleanse face neck and
decolletage area okay so it's an oil I
don't know if it's an oil no it's not
it's more like a serum okay that's what
it looks like with a little dropper
thing it energizes the blend of skin
luminous and natural antioxidants is
combined with restorative higher veronik
acid to help improve the look of dull
tired skin damage and premature aging
skin cool alright so that is all the
products that I picked up the one thing
I love about Rye is every time I order
they always spoil me with heaps and
heaps of samples mainly by Dermalogica
so I've got the daily resurface that
they gave me quite a few samples of that
and then I got their exfoliating body
scrub and some multivitamin power firm
age smart that looks like this
and then I got some active moist which
is my favorite moisturizer for oily skin
I would highly recommend getting a
sample or trying that one out it's my
favorite and then I have two asap
samples one is the daily facial cleanser
and the other is their correcting cream
and then I have a cute little file from
RIE
so yeah it concludes my whole I hope you
guys enjoyed it and if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and I
guess I'll see you in my next video bye
