I know I've been a little bit maa lately
but I'm getting back into it for the
year so I decide to fill my birthday
makeup I just went out for dinner with
friends and then went clubbing so I'm
going in with a benefit Porefessional
first just to fill in all my pores and
then going in with the hourglass mineral
veil primer and just popping that all
over my face by the way don't mind my
dodgy tan I don't know why I put so much
on my face but obviously by the end of
it you can see that my face looks a lot
better with makeup cept like a little
bit of a lighter shade foundation on so
yeah then I just spread my face with a
bit of the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and then I'm mixing a
little bit of the Urban Decay all
nighter and was that the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk and I'm just applying that
with one of my favorite makeup brushes
which is the morphe I come over the
number but I'll leave it listed down
below and I'm just applying that all
over my face
then I thought my face was a little bit
too pale compared to the rest of my body
so I just put a little bit of the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation in the
shade at 54 just on my face and are
blending that in as well for concealer I
use the taut shape tape in the shade
light/medium and just applying that
underneath my eyes to conceal and
highlight and then to highlight the rest
of my face I use the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light just to pop
on my forehead down the bridge of my
nose Cupid's bow and then on my chin and
then of course blending it out
then taking the alarm Mercier
translucent powder and just using that
to bake underneath my eyes just with
that same at Beauty Blender as we used
before and then for eyebrows I'm using
the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in
the shade medium at brown and just using
that to fill in my brows
then I'm just taking some Maybelline
that fit me concealer again in the shade
light to define the brows just on a
concealer brush so just running that
below and above each brow then setting
the rest of the face with your Stralis
fresh and flawless face powder in the
shade at darkest Brown just on a large
Too Faced fluffy brush
then I'm just taking a reborn up brush
and I'm just wiping off the excess
powder from the under I bake and then at
true bronze up my face I'm using the Mac
give me Sun and yeah I'm just pretty
much adding a little bit more than usual
just because I feel like my base was a
little bit too light too in comparison
to the rest of my body so I did go a
little bit ham on the bronzer but it's
literally one of my favorite bronzers
ever I love the color
I like matches and complements my tan
really well so just facing that in at
the hollows of my cheek bones around the
perimeter of my face and then down the
sides of my nose and then along up my
jawline as well then taking the new
sweet peach true face palette oh my god
it actually smells amazing I'm taking
the bronze e shade I don't know if it
really like did much but I just went
over my bronzer with it just to give
myself a little bit more of a glow and I
also use the blush that was in it as
well
and then going in with the Kat Von D
shade and light palette I'm taking the
middle shade just true a contour my face
just placing that directly in at the
hollows of my cheek bones
then I'm just taking it some more of the
laura mercier translucent powder and
just using that to bake underneath my
contour just using the same beauty
blender so just creating a line directly
underneath then taking the Too Faced
palette again and I'm going in with the
highlighter and this is bomb like this
highlighter looks exactly like the mary
lou manizer which I love it's like a
really pretty like white champagne
e-type highlight so I'm just placing
that on the cheekbones Cupid's bow and
then down the bridge of my nose it was
seriously loving it for eyeshadow I use
the Kylie cosmetics Burgundy palette I'm
taking at that top middle shade as a
transition shade in my crease with a
large fluffy brush
then taking the orangey color and also
replacing that in my crease as well
then taking that ready brownie gorgeous
shade I'm just using that mainly in the
outer corners just to create a little
bit more depth in the eye makeup look
and I'm also dragging that underneath my
lower lash line as well then taking the
hooter Beauty rose gold eyeshadow
palette and taking 24k which is just the
foiled gold eyeshadow and just placing
that on the inner corners of my eyes
just with my finger and then just using
the same blending brush as before just
to blend out all the harsh edges then
I'm taking this Oprah highlighter in the
shade blissful and using that to
highlight my inner corners and brow bone
it's so pretty it's like a champagne tea
gold I actually use this to like
highlight my body I like highlighting
like my chest area and my arms and my
shoulders like when I go I think it
looks really pretty and people like
always compliment my skin when I put
highlighter on and then I'm taking I
think of this shade a cocoa out of the
huda beauty palette and I'm just mainly
focusing that on the outer corners of
the eyes just to create a little bit
more depth and also using the black as
well
and then I'm just wiping away the excess
powder from the bake from underneath my
contour off I hate how the ring light
really like makes my face look really
pale when it really isn't must just be
the white light doing it but I swear it
my foundation matched my body in the end
I'm taking the Rimmel scandaleyes micro
liner and just using that to create a
wing
and then I'm just curling my lashes just
with a lash curl that I got from Kohl's
and then I'm using the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner just to line my
waterline
then going in with cocoa eyeshadow again
from the huda beauty palette I'm just
taking it on one of these definer
brushes this one's from uh Nastasia or
leave or my brushes let's down below and
just using that true it smoke out the
lower lashline
for mascara I'm using the Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara one of my
favorites just to obviously it coat my
top and bottom lashes and then for
eyelashes I tried it on like five
thousand different pairs and I just
didn't know which ones I'll leave it and
down below because I can't remember
which ones I used because I didn't show
them on the camera but yeah I'll
definitely leave them listed down below
and then just coating my bottom lashes
are so long and it's so hard to not get
my bottom lashes like clumpy then going
in with this Smashbox lipliner that I
actually received the other day it's in
their new gen series um I'll also leave
that listed down below but wow these are
amazing like I love the color of this
and then to fill in my lips I'm using my
go true which is the Anasazi Beverly
Hills dusty rose liquid lipstick I've
gone through one whole tubes is my
second tube it's my favorite if I don't
know what lipstick to wear like to go
out or whatever
always always wear this one so if I'm
wearing a lipstick on histogram and I
haven't tagged them that I'm probably
wearing dusty rose because it's my
favorite and then I'm trying out the new
two-faced sweet peach lip glosses again
I forgot what color it was in but I'm
pretty sure it was the palest one and
they smell and actually taste amazing I
did did lick my lips but yeah I put that
on top and then I just wet my face with
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray when I killed my hair put on a
dress I actually wasn't naked I swear I
was wearing a boob tube but this is what
I ended up wearing to my birthday today
