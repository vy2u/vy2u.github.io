another weekly vlog it's Monday I'm
thinking of washing my extensions for
the first time this morning cuz I have a
few things to do today
it is literally so all the other roots I
usually can't really go without a day
washing my hair because like I'm such an
oily person even my face everything like
oil just calm down and nowhere seriously
um so I'm gonna wash my extensions and
then I might just film me like
blow-drying my hair for the first time
with these on seeing how different it
feels and then maybe like styling it or
something so I'm gonna hop in the shower
now and then I'll set my camera up here
and show you guys how I style my hair oh
my god I really like don't want to I
feel like I can just get away with
putting like dry shampoo at my roots but
it's been like four days now it needs a
wash and it just feels so much better
when i swatched as well so this is about
ten minutes of blow-drying I just still
have like the ends are a little bit wet
but I'm in a rush and I have to go to my
Barker's house which means grab my in
Croatian I'm to dye a hair I usually go
and dye your hair like once a month
that's just like a little monthly ritual
and just spend some time together
so I'm gonna go there and then come back
and I've got a few things to do but um
yeah that was so much easier than I
thought to blow-dry effort usually it
took me like 10 minutes of were dry my
like natural hair without the extensions
but this is ten minutes and it's like a
majority dry it's just on the ends are a
little bit wet but I'll just let that
air dry come back and if it needs to be
blow-dried I'll finish it off and then
straighten it and probably curl it and
show you guys how I kill it so yeah I'll
see you guys later on if you guys wanted
to know what my straight out the door
pretty much like everyday makeup look
right now all it is is I put some
concealer over my like pimples or
problem areas then I just set that with
the Australis fresh and flawless face
powder
and then I put some comics on my lips
and that is literally all I do to my
face no bronzer a highlighter no mascara
no brows just three products and yeah
hey guys so I just got home before and
I've just gone to curl my hair so now
I'm gonna brush it through that what
really took me like 10 15 minutes max
and i just use this new me um curling
wand now i'm just brushing out the curls
oh my god kind of looks more like
hollywood sort of curls i love it
actually what it looks like from the
back
I always wear my hair like behind my
ears so then I push this to the front oh
my god
I'm literally that obsessed like it's a
joke so that is what my hair looks like
cold love I feel like it definitely
looks a lot more fuller and it natural
when your hair's curled as opposed to
straight so yeah I'm gonna go and put
some makeup on and film some stuff for
you guys
so yeah I'll chat you guys later on I'll
let you just receive their worst news of
my whole fucking toy life
so my shop got broken into will the sell
on that I do make up from all my makeups
gone everything is gone the whole makeup
kit that I've spent the last five years
building gone just like that like it's
gone I have insurance but that that's
not the point like I don't care about
getting money for makeup it's I've got
makeup there that I've had a few years
and makeup that you can't get any more
makeup that I've been gifted like I've
worked so fuck it card to build that
makeup kit it's just it's gone I'll
never get it back ever
you're a makeup artist and you do makeup
not from your home or if you do makeup
from like somewhere other than your home
don't keep your makeup there no matter
how secure the place is do not keep your
makeup there because you just never know
I highly doubt it would have been one of
my clients that did it but like at the
back of my hand who else would know
where all my makeup is they even
specifically went into this back
cupboard where all my backups are and
they took that too like how would you
know like
No if you're gonna rob somewhere you go
and look absolutely everywhere but like
it's just like I just think I've maybe
done their makeup or they know who I am
and that they've been in the shop before
which is like literally like makes me
sick but then again there's a nail lady
and also eyelash lady's in there as well
that they could have got the idea to
steal my makeup from but not only was
all my makeup so and they even stole all
the nail stuff they stole all the
eyelash stuff they saw absolutely
everything like the whole shop is pretty
much upside down I honestly don't know
what to do I have clients this weekend
like I'm so lucky and blessed that I
have makeup here that I can use and just
take with me there's just a few
foundations and stuff that I'll
obviously need to buy just a few shades
like thank goodness for that because I
don't know what I would have done if I
didn't have like the makeup collection I
had at home like I would have had to
cancel and there's literally nothing
worse and I hate then canceling clones
I'll be fine it's just the initial shock
of it like I'm just I'm so shocked right
now like I can't believe someone would
go to that level to do that I was
supposed to go to breakfast with one of
my friends this morning and I just I'm
not in the mood to do that I was
supposed to film today that's not
happening I'm kind of even like fucking
scared to go back there to be honest
like there is no way I'm leaving my
makeup there for me I want no way in
hell so yeah if they decide they want to
do it again not be nothing there for
them to take I'm gonna go make something
to eat even I'm not hungry but it'll
make me feel better
but yeah I'll keep you guys updated
anyways
so go into the cellar now
that sparked this
so crazy well I like I got my B blenders
though and they - uh-huh
hey oh happy Wednesday I didn't vlog
after yesterday's incident just because
I just really was not in the mood to be
on camera or anything like that I just
wanted to relax taking what happened
I've just been pretty much spending
today sorting out how I'm gonna rebuild
my kit for the weekend
I'm luckily I have a bit of makeup here
that I can use I just went to Daiso and
got heaps of um storage days I was so
good and like really affordable for
storage and stuff last Sorella did my
hair they just gave me a blow-dry and
they like styled it which made me feel a
bit better but yeah I'm fine just sort
of like taking it in apparently also
crown brushes which is a shop not far
from mine got robbed last night
everything taken so it's obviously
probably just a random that just wants
to get all of these beauty products to
probably make their own business but I
highly doubt they're gonna get away with
it and apparently the same car that was
spotted on our surveillance cameras was
exactly the same as the robbery from
crown brushes last night I really hope
they find the people or person that did
it because I just really want to know
who it is but yeah I don't really have
that much on for the rest of the day
tomorrow I'm going to get my laser and I
think I've got really anything exciting
on then you know packing my makeup so
yeah I'll speak to you guys later
good morning guys it is Thursday I am
just waiting on my friend George we're
going out to breakfast
I found this keto friendly cafe called
Cafe Republic so we're gonna go check
that out and I just have a few
appointments today I've got to go to
Australian skin clinics and get my laser
done so I'll try and film there what he
said he was like three minutes away and
it's been like
minutes I swear okay he's probably so
confused I was like oh there's a park
next to me but someone just poured in it
oh um anyways he's here and we're gonna
go in now this is the menu what do we
get
we've got cauliflower cheese waffles
bacon avocado french eggs aioli and a
balsamic glaze and a bulletproof coffee
josh is trying the bullet hole coffee
tsunamis
you properly types the butter in it just
tastes like an almond milk latte
looks amazing cheesy cauliflower waffles
with eggs bacon what else
chili aioli and balsamic glaze oh my god
YUM hey guys oh my god that was
literally like that did not feel like a
meal that you eat on a diet like that's
how good it was like oh okay I think I'm
going the wrong way still no news or
updates in regards to break in all they
know is that it was a like a white
hatchback Toyota and it's the same car
that robbed crown brushes which is
another makeup Beauty Supply place like
literally just down the road they
identified that car as well so it's
literally the same person
thanks guys so this is what I bought
yesterday I got this from Priceline and
then a bunch of these from the days oh
and then this is a nail polish stand
from Priceline and then hi guys so I
left my camera at Australian Skin Clinic
so when always they sell on unpacked
everything and now I've come back and
picked up my camera and I also went to
my P o box and got a few parcel so I'll
open them for you guys full lashes do
these up by the friend Jillian lashes
and Michael destroy softly thanks guys
oh my god Matt wait what get fucked
Oh No
that makes me so happy
I was actually stressing out because I
was gonna have to drive to Brisbane to
go and um go restock my kit because
that's the only place that I can use my
Mac Pro card because we don't have any
Mac Pro stores here on the Gold Coast I
was planning to go to Brisbane tomorrow
and get the majority of the stuff for my
kit but Mac has sent me my favorite
foundations that I use in my kid oh my
god so they sent me NC 42 NC 37 NC 35 oh
my god I'm so I can't believe it I'm so
grateful they sent me a fix plus + NC 10
they're literally the colors that I use
all the time thank you so much DJ's and
we are so sorry to hear that much of so
much of your makeup was stolen we hope
this helps to rebuild your kit thank you
so much Julianne oh my that's like just
those little things just really really
helped me and I just can't believe it
thank you I want to see I don't offer
something else Mac - one 7s brush I've
never tried that one before
thank you literally so much from the
bottom of my heart like that means so so
much to me like you actually don't
understand Oh made my day because that's
the one thing that I was really
stressing about was foundations like
yeah I do have a lot of makeup at home
but I don't really have that many
different shades that I like that I will
use on my clients because Mac is all I
use on my clients but that may be so
happy thank you so much I can't close
I've never heard it was brown before oh

your kit was stolen we couldn't imagine
what it's like so hopefully these will
get you through for the time being

pretty soft

to use more on my clients always use
