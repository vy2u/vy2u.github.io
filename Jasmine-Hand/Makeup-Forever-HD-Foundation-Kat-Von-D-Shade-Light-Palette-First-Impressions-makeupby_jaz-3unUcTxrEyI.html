so in today's video I decided to do a
first impressions on this Make Up For
Ever HD foundation I just received this
literally yesterday and I thought I may
as well film a first impressions video
so I do live in Australia now and it is
winter and my skin does tend to get a
little bit on the drier side so I'm
really excited to use this because
someone comments on my photo that it was
really really bad for oily skin but I
will see that for myself and the box
says HD foundation that combines
flawless coverage and the extremely
natural finish the Sarah site contained
in HD foundation heightens the diffusion
of light intensifies the glow of the
skin enriched with blah blah blah blah
blah it's usually smooth and elastic in
texture it makes it easy to apply and a
pleasure to wear skin texture is refined
to give a very natural complexion derma
logically tested oil-free shape before
use tested six hours after application
of the product on tentative volunteers
so I'm gonna shake it up and it looks so
funny not sorry
so the primer that I use when I'm using
expensive foundations is an expensive
primer so I use the hourglass little
primer but a drugstore one if you're
interested that I really really like is
the face based skin primer hydrating
primer by model Cove I really really
like this one it's silicon based and it
just makes your foundation light on so
easy so I highly recommend that one if
you
willing to spend a lot on this one we do
this ones like I need to lose or
something pray I'm just gonna put that
all over okay so I'm gonna go ahead and
just put one squirt onto my metal mixing
palette the consistency is actually
quite runny to be honest I thought it'd
be way bigger for some reason I've just
dampened my Beauty Blender but I'm gonna
dot this all over my face with just a
concealer brush first and then blend it
out it's like an exact match of my neck
I'm so happy
okay I'm gonna go with one more pump
because it doesn't seem like enough
because I like quite a full coverage
doesn't really have a smell if you're
wondering so now I'm just going to blend
it in with my Beauty Blender I've seen
on the heaps of people use this
foundation in their freelancing kit
that's mainly the reason why I picked it
up because if it looks really nice on my
skin then I might buy a couple more
shades to having my kit so yeah it's the
reason why I got it
so it's so far it's blending out pretty
nicely but it is it does dry really
quick so I don't really recommend dot in
your face
done in your face and then blending it
in okay so it does a really really good
job
at you know covering um all the
discoloration on your face but I'm kind
of having trouble covering up my
blemishes because they are red okay so
I'm just gonna go in with this instant
age rewind concealer in the shade medium
and go over my blemishes obviously I
kind of find that because I have heaps
of these in the light pale so use these
to highlight and this consistency is
like really thick compared to the other
ones I don't know why oh that seemed to
do the job at concealing okay I'm happy
now yeah but yeah overall let me give it
a little seam up I'm really really
impressed with this foundation I'm so so
glad that I got it and I find it really
really hard to find a foundation that
matches my fake tan so my Holy Grail
foundation is my Estee Lauder Double
Wear and I have the color ivory beige
and it does match but it doesn't give me
I mean it's not the perfect match but
this is like I don't think it could get
any more perfect like it is thank God if
you use the loving ten dark mousse and I
highly recommend the N one to eight
color and this foundation so far but I'm
just going to do the
my makeup and then come back after I
finish it and then every few hours just
to update you guys on my thoughts so
yeah I'll see you then so I also
received the new Kat Von D shade and
light palette which is just a contour
and highlighting palette and I really
wanted to do a first impression of this
so I didn't want to do it in a separate
video so I'm going to finish the rest of
my makeup and then contour and highlight
with this and let you know my first
impressions of it
so yeah I'll just do the rest of my face
and I'll see you in like a second mom so
I've just I'm a concealed and
highlighted so I'm gonna go in with the
kat von d palette I'm just gonna take
the banana shade because I like to use
the banana shade from Anastasia's
palette I'm just using this makeup
addiction highlighting brush whoa okay
but I really like this
yeah this one's a lot more powdery than
the Anastasia but it definitely does a
better job at brightening so I'm just
going to take the matte whiter shade and
just use that on my chin Cupid's bow and
down the center of my face I've just set
to my face with the Rimmel translucent
powder I usually use the Australis fresh
and flawless but didn't want to add any
extra coverage so I just put a
translucent powder over the top to set
the foundation even though it already
felt set but because I have oily skin I
kind of have to set my foundation so I'm
going to go in with the shade and light
palette to contour I'm so excited I
think I'm going to use the kind of grey
based color I'm just gonna go ahead
I probably shouldn't have used this
brush to the puck Dan but your and the
color is very similar to the UH Nastasia
one sir
and then I'm going to take the darker
color and use that on my forehead area
I like the dark color
it's like really dark and y'all just
with
did it go to the contrary I'm gonna put
it on my jewel I'm still using the grey
and now I'm going to go in with this
makeup addiction large fluff brush and
contouring my nose with the gray color
I'm gonna bake my face cuz that's what
I've always always do I'm just gonna
bake my contour though I'm not I'm dig
my eyes because I just used the banana
shade so it is down ten o'clock so it's
been an hour since my foundation has
been on and it still looks the same as
when I applied it I literally can't
fault it it's gotten a bit um cakey
around my nose with that some will every
single foundation gets cake here on my
nose and yeah I'm really really really
impressed with it so far probably check
back with you every two or three hours
to see how it's sitting on my skin so
yeah I will see you then hey guys say it
is now 1:00 p.m.
I've had this foundation on for four
hours now and it still looks really good
just to have my nose it is separating
but other than that it stayed really
well I haven't gotten oily at all
actually loved winter because I never
get oily down my t-zone but in summer
holy hell like my face is a literal oil
farm I can't really fault it it's held
my highlight contour and blush my
lipstick still on because I haven't
eaten I should probably go have lunch
now this pimple is annoying me but a
pimple it's a pimple I'm so so glad that
I just bit the bullet and got this
foundation because I wasn't gonna buy it
because I'm really happy with my
foundations at the moment but this has
got to be up there with one of my favs
atm
that highlight though like you guys need
to like get on the highlight train okay
I'll try and do a check-in at 5:00 and
then at 9:00 p.m. at night just to see
the whole 12-hour wear of this
foundation so yeah I'll check back in
with you guys at 5:00 hi everyone so it
is now 5:00 p.m. and I've had it on for
eight hours and to think about that I
can sort of see oil forming on my skin
like around my nose on my chin and on my
cheeks but none of the foundation has
come off actually at living on my chin
but I was like leaning on my pillow so
that's probably why otherwise my face
still looks pretty much the same as when
I first applied it my under-eye area
hasn't creased at all so I'm loving the
Kat Von D shade and light palette
contour still on fleek and so is my
blush and highlight I would definitely
definitely use this foundation in my kit
for anyone that is a freelance makeup
artist and do use this foundation for
your clients if you could please comment
below what colors you use because I'm
gonna make an order from Sephora and
order a few more shades so I can mix and
match and whatever so yeah please
comment down below also it doesn't have
any flashback I'll insert a photo here
which is one of the other reasons why I
picked up this foundation because Estee
Lauder can tend to flash back so that's
why I don't use that so much on clients
that will be exposed to flash
photography or whatever so yeah it
doesn't have any flashback which is
amazing especially for Bridal I will
check back with you around 8:00
to 9:00 p.m. tonight for my final update
but yeah a hundred percent impressed
love this foundation and yeah I can't
wait to use it some more so I will see
you in about three or four hours hammer
on it so it is now at 9 p.m. and I've
had this foundation on for 12 hours now
my face isn't that much more oilier than
it was at 5:00 it's just around here
really that's shiny and on my chin and a
little bit on my nose but none of the
foundation has faded or looks blotchy or
patchy my highlight contour blush
everything has stayed in place
especially my under eye area I don't
usually get creases anyway in my under
eye area but obviously the kat von d
palette is good because I haven't had
any creases whatsoever underneath my
eyes and yeah I'm really super impressed
with this foundation and I really can't
wait to order some more for my kit don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it and if it was helpful to
you and I will see you in my next video
