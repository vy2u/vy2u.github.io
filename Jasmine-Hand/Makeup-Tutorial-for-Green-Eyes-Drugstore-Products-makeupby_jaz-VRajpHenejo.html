so in today's video I decided to do a
makeup tutorial that complements green
eyes now obviously I'm wearing contacts
I have brown eye but if you're wondering
I got them from pretty fabulous on
Instagram I'll leave their name right
here and a link where you can purchase
them in the description box down below I
also use affordable drugstore products
so if you live in Australia um you can
get most of this stuff from price and
actually all of it except for the
eyelashes that I got from shop misae and
they were $1.00 my chichi cosmetics
eyeshadow palette that I use but you can
get that from my Target or David Jones
I'm pretty sure and the brow products
you can't actually get in the store it's
just online but it's called penny
cosmetics they're really cheap and
really great quality so if you'd like to
see how I created this coppery gold
smokey eye with a pop of purple then
please keep watching so after I wash my
face I love to moisturize my skin and I
use the Dermalogica active moist
moisturizer it's amazing for oily skin
and the foundation that I decided to use
was the Maybelline Dream wonder
foundation so I'm just applying this
foundation with my concealer brush just
because I don't want to contaminate the
wand of the foundation because it comes
with like a little wand with a ball on
the end it's really weird but anyways
I'm at blending that all in with my damp
Beauty Blender so if you're not willing
to spend $30 on the original Beauty
Blender the one I'm holding on the left
is the Real Techniques miracle sponge
and the one on the right is the chichi
cosmetics one they are really really
affordable droops I would highly
recommend them both so because I have a
really really bad skin day that day I'm
using the instant age rewind by
Maybelline in the shade medium and just
going
of are my blemishes with that with the
same concealer brush so now I'm taking
my favorite ever drugstore concealer it
is the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade light fair I'm pretty sure or
just light and as you can see I'm
highlighting it and concealing my under
eye area down the bridge of my nose in
the middle of my forehead my Cupid's bow
and a little bit on my chin and then
just blending it all out with my damp
Beauty Blender
and then to set those highlighted areas
I'm just taking my face of Australia
translucent powder on my ELF blush brush
and packing that in those areas I'm
taking my fade setting powder it's just
the Australia's fresh and flawless in
the shade darkest Brown and patting that
all over my face to set my foundation
you see my older videos and you probably
already know this little beauty hack of
mine so pretty much what I'm doing is
creating my own contouring brush so all
you need is a big powder brush and two
bobby pins and as you can see I'm just
sticking them either side to create a
narrow brush so the bronze I'm using is
the model comb matte bronzer and
contouring my cheeks with the brush that
we just made and I'm actually pretty
happy with how it turned out I haven't
used this kind of brush in ages because
I have contouring brushes so there's no
real need for me to do this but yeah I
really liked it
so now I'm just continuing bronzing the
perimeter of my face my jawline
underneath my lip and then I'm
contouring my nose with my favorite
contouring brush it's the one by
printing cosmetics so now baking my face
as per usual using the face of Australia
translucent powder on a angled sponge by
the way this is dry not wet I just had a
few questions asking me I don't wet this
sponge I do it completely dry as you can
see I'm just creating a line straight
underneath my contour and then I like to
highlight the bridge of my nose on my
chin and also underneath my eyes and a
little bit on my forehead
so as you know I have my eyebrows
cosmetically tattooed on so all I'm
doing is just getting the Agana and the
Stella water on a cotton tip and just
removing that excess powder from my
eyebrows and then I'm using the
Thoroughbred powder by Pony cosmetics
just to define the start of my brow and
a little bit of the arch now I'm just
using that staying fit me concealer to
define the bottoms of my brow I'm just
using this Jessup concealer brush and as
you can see I'm just making a crisp line
for now using the model code more Brad
I'm using the lighter shade and it's
pretty much a dupe for the give me brow
by benefit and as you can see I'm just
using it as a brow gel and I'm just
removing that excess translucent powder
that we use to bake with and for blush
I'm using this essence blush up blush I
can remember what the shade is but I'll
leave it down below and I'm not 100%
sure that it's still available in stores
sorry and then I'm using the essence so
glow cream to powder highlighter this
stuff is so amazing especially for the
inner corners it really really brightens
up the eyes and just leaves the most
amazing finish on big cheeks as you can
see I will show you super impressed with
this now I'm taking my AC on to
highlight and contour kit by Australis
and intensifying that highlight a little
bit more with the highlight shade on the
palate maybe
so for eyeshadows i'm using the chichi
cosmetics extravaganza palette and as
you can see I just took that really
medium brown color which is perfect for
a transition shade and use that on a big
fluffy brush and as you can see I'm
using windscreen wiper motions and
 that into my crease and slowly
building up that color so it becomes
darker and then I'm taking a mixture of
the gold and copper shades and on a flat
shader brush by zoeva I'm just packing
that onto the inner corner of my lid / I
kind of like ended up putting it over
the whole of my lid but ended up
covering it with the darker shade
anyways but I'm just intensifying the
color and then blending everything so
it's seamless so now I'm taking the
black from the palette and as you can
see I'm just packing it on the outer
corner of my eye with a small blending
brush and then just blending it all
together with a larger blending brush
and then I go in again to intensify the
black a little bit more so now I'm just
creating a medium-sized sort of wing
using the new Maybelline hyper sharp
liquid liner
and now I'm taking what's left of my
chichi cosmetics purple gel liner and
heavily lining my waterline and then
grabbing the purple out of the palette
and smudging that and blending that down
so it looks really smoky now I'm taking
that same essence so glow highlighter
and just placing that on the inner
corner of my eye and now taking my
Maybelline lash sensational waterproof
mascara
I'm just coating my top and bottom
lashes and then applying my falsies
which are from shop miss a calm they
were a dollar and they are incredible
you should seriously check them out if
the lips I decided to go nude so I'm
using my essence in the nude lip liner
I'm pretty sure that's what it's called
and then followed by it the essence
barely-there lipstick and then on top I
also use them as lipstick called always
so Matt I'm pretty sure I'll list
everything down below anyways
