so in today's video I did this makeup
look on my face and I use the new makeup
geek money MUA palette which looks like
this it is honestly the most perfect
palette in my opinion they're definitely
shades that I use day to day well not so
much these too but these shades I use on
a day-to-day basis so it's perfect for
traveling it's so small the actual
eyeshadows actually no they are the same
size when I first opened the palette I
thought the hands of the eyeshadows were
smaller than the original pans but I
think they are the same size so yeah if
you would like to see how I created this
look on my face then keep on watching
okay so I'm gonna start off with this
Nivea men sensitive at post shave balm
as a primer I'm gonna try and use
different products in this video because
I tend to use the same product so I'm
gonna give some new products ago and
some old ones that I haven't used in
ages so I'm just going to pop that on
I've actually used this partner before
and I liked it I just have so many
powers that I forget to use it so I'm
just try and start using it again
because it's so affordable and I
actually really like the smell of it so
good foundation I'm going to use the
L'Oreal Paris True Match which is
apparently the new one I'm going to use
the color sable sand and I'm going to
use my zoeva buffer brush I haven't used
a kabuki brush to put on a foundation in
so long so it's like really hard whoops
it's probably still foundation on it
I hope this color matches me
I'm just gonna go over that with my
beauty blender so you can sell my
undereyes I'm gonna use my Maybelline
fit me because let's be real I haven't
found a concealer that I like as much as
this so I'm just gonna use this to
highlight my under eye area okay to set
my under eye area I'm going to use the
Mac Pro emphasize which just looks like
this it just comes in a pan not in a
palette I got it because Jaclyn Hill
says she loves it so I'm going to give
it a go and I'm going to pack that
underneath my eyes to set my concealer
oh it's like really white just me or
does it have glitter in it it's probably
ideal for paler skin types but because
I'm quite tan at the moment it's
literally coming up really white on me
not really digging the coverage of this
powder so I'm just gonna go ahead and
bake with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder just on my Beauty Blender I'm
just putting that over the top of my
concealer I just think the baking
technique works the best for my creasing
underneath my eyes it literally makes
the concealer creaseless all day night
and I know I just love the way that it
looks under my eyes it's really silky
and it just looks nice and vibrant and
fresh and to set the rest of my face i'm
using the australia's fresh and flawless
as per usual i'm using the color medium
tan which is the darkest color it's not
that dark though like if you have really
dark skin it's probably going to be too
light for you like this is the color
but I'm using that because my foundation
was a tad too light so I'm just gonna
warm up my face with this okay so now
I'm gonna wipe off the bake I don't like
to keep it on for too long because I
feel like sometimes you can kind of see
the line where the bake was so yeah I
just wiped that away after a few minutes
not even a minute maybe like 30 seconds
actually okay so the bronze I'm gonna
use my new mac 135 brush which is
absolutely amazing I don't know why I
didn't pick it up sooner
I wanted this brush like a year ago and
I literally couldn't justify the price
of like $80 for it but with my mac pro
card I only got it for like $65 so I
could kind of justify that so I just put
the bullet and bought it and it is
literally the best bronzing brush ever
so I'm gonna use that with Mac UV Sun
it's kind of growing on me the first
time I use it I was like oh this sponza
looks really really orangie but now I
really really like it especially with
this brush so I'm just going to warm up
my face see look at that
it already looks contoured it's going
around my forehead as well my cheeks
underneath my double chin
I just love this bronze and now I'm like
obsessed with it I'm going to use the
same brush and I'm going to go in with
hoola by benefit and I'm just gonna use
that to chisel my cheeks a little bit
more I swear I don't even need a
contouring brush like this is amazing
I'm just gonna go ahead and contour up
my nose also using hall up and I'm just
using this Jessup brush that I got from
eBay and just lightly contouring my nose
I wish I knew how to contour my nose
properly my nose is so so hard to
contour the blush I recently got the
warm sole blush which looks like this
it's not it's kind of like a bronze up
what with like Coralie undertones and
it's kind of glittery as well I can't
really explain it to be honest as you
guys may be already know I'm not really
much of a blush person like I only wear
the littlest bit because I don't think
it suits me but I think this blush is
like the perfect pigment and color for
my skintone like it's not too bright and
it's not too dark if that makes any
sense at all
so for highlight I'm gonna use the new
Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kit will
not really new but recently new and I'm
going to use the color dipping in gold
for my highlight so that was really loud
I'm so excited
Oh what is life right now
this color it's gold
it reminds me a lot of the so Hollywood
highlighter I think I put a bit too much
on but oh well just gonna put a bit on
my nose that is the base done I'm gonna
zoom you guys up so you can see what I'm
doing better on the eyes so the palette
that I will be using today is the new
makeup geek Cosmo
it's Manny mu a color palette which
looks amazing I'm so so so excited to
this tutorial I've used this palette a
few times actually and I'm obsessed with
it already so I'm just gonna go ahead
and start off with beaches and cream
which is this lovely transition shade
I'm just popping that in my crease and
sort of upper crease area just so it let
me put the darker colors on it's just
going to blend really well and look nice
and seamless so then I'm gonna grab Sora
which is the middle shade which is
really really similar to creme brulee by
makeup geek which is one of my favorite
transition shades and I'm just also
using that in my crease so now I'm gonna
do my brow bone highlight and I'm going
to use this shade which is called
Artemis I hope I pronounced that right
and I'm just going to pop that on my
brow bone is so pigmented yes next up
I'm gonna take Luna which is this
gorgeous coppery color this might be a
bit gross but I love to use my finger
for packing on heaps of product because
I think the pigment sort of looks the
best when I do that so I'm just popping
it in on my finger and packing that
basically on my whole lid so that's what
I'm doing
speaking of fingers and eyeshadow did
you see that post that I posted on
Instagram with that client with the most
horrible makeup I've ever seen and
apparently she used her fingers like
what makeup artist in their right mind
would use her fingers I kind of think
that was a bit of a joke because like
had the do you do eyeliner with
your fingers and eyebrows but in the
back of my mind I'm kind of thinking
that makeup artist posted that for
lights because she got like
like five thousand likes on that photo
and she would have got new likes on a
page so I kind of think she might have
done it for the followers or the likes
on Facebook I don't know that's just my
opinion anyways but yeah I don't know if
that was a joke
or if it was real but if it was real
then that's not on honestly okay I'm
just getting rid of that excess fallout
with a big brush add the lip colors on
I'm just going to go in with that
blending brush and blend it all together
in with the transition color so now I'm
just going to go in and blend that color
out
it's gonna go in with a clean blending
brush and blend those colors together go
take a bit more of aphrodite and just
work that on the outer corner now I'm
gonna take artemis again and put that in
my inner corner ariel bought this shade
is so pigmented I'm in love okay so now
I'm gonna go in with this winged
eyeliner by the balm and I think I'm
gonna do like a medium sort of style
wing so I'm just gonna start up to the
tail
so while away for the top island dry I'm
gonna go in with my Maybelline mm I
studio and I'm gonna place this in my
waterline so I'm going into the palette
again and I'm gonna go in with the
middle shade which is called Sora just
on a small tapered brush I'm gonna use
that as like a transition shade for my
lower lashline so I'm just gonna pop
that on and then I'm gonna go in with
Aphrodite just a dark brown color and
smoke out the bottom lash line so the
mascara I'm going to use the essence I
love extreme just gonna put a coat of
that on for my falsies so the lashes I'm
gonna use the house of lashes iconic I
bought this little lash case with my
last order and I just pop them in here
so perfect for traveling and look how
cute it is so I'm gonna grab one of
those lashes this is what the lashes
look like they are honestly the most
amazing lashes when you're going for
like a more dramatic look so the glue I
use the half of lashes lash glue it's my
favorite glue and it always will be
seriously like super glue
so I thought while I'm using Manny's
Pelt on the eyes and may as well use his
liquid lipstick that he made with gerard
cosmetics which is just an amazing sort
of dusty pinky nude so to line my lips
I'm going to use the L'Oreal Paris 6 300
beige lip liner so I kind of want glossy
lips with this look so I'm going to go
ahead and put on the bon lip gloss in
the shade BAM which is pretty similar to
the liquid lipstick so I hope you guys
