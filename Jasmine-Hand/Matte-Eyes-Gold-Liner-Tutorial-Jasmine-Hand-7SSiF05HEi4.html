challenge seems like forever since I've
done a voiceover for one of these types
of videos but I'm going to get straight
into I'm just using the benefit car brow
which is just a Poe made in the shade
number 4 and just filling in her brows
the numbers taking a light concealer and
just running that below and above just
to define them a little bit more and I
also like to put some on the eyelid as
well just to prime it before eyeshadow
and then swing the eyelids in place just
with some translucent powder and then
before I forget I'm taking the benefit
gimme brow and just running that through
her brows to set them in place and I'm
taking the Too Faced natural love
palette this one's new look how pretty
it looks taking the third shade from the
top which is just like a sort of gray
toned transition color a transition
color and just placing that in the
crease with a large fluffy brush
now I'm taking this more peachy tone and
I'm using that also in the creatures to
further blend the first transition shade
out a little bit more then taking the
dark brown from the palette and placing
that in the outer corners of the eyes
with my Mac two one seven brush this is
leach the most favorite brush for outer
corners you guys need it in your life
even though it basically costed my whole
freakin arm and legs but it is worth it
and then grabbing that first blending
brush from earlier and just blending it
all in together then I'm taking the
matte white from the palette and wall
this is pigmented so good and just
placing this on the inner corners of the
eye decide to keep the eyeshadow matte
because we were using little liners and
I thought it worked well together
then taking them matte black from the
palette as well I'm just putting that in
the outer corners just to make it a
little bit more dramatic then taking my
favorite black liner ever the Maybelline
eye studio and I'm just using that on my
zoeva winged liner brush and creating a
wing and taking the Urban Decay
razorsharp
liner in gold I first wanted to do like
a double liner but because her eyes were
quite hooded I just decided to color in
everywhere where I put the black liner
and then I decided to put a couple of
lines just above where her crease is I
noticed thought it looked a little bit
more dramatic and glamorous that way and
then I'm popping on some Ardell mink
lashes these are new with the duo lash
glue then onto face and just taking it
some moisturizer first and popping that
all over and then going in with the
benefit Porefessional and just popping
that in the center of her face then
under spraying with some mac fix+ before
foundation and the foundation I use was
Mac Studio Fix and NC 35 and mixed it
with a little bit of the becca
shimmering opal liquid skin Perfector
which is a highlighter and yeah just
applying that evenly all over a face
with a damp Beauty Blender and then for
concealer underneath the eyes I use the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
light as always and just creating upside
down triangles underneath her eyes
popping on a chin Cupid's bow on our
forehead and down the bridge of a nose
and of course blending it all in
as well
you
then to set the concealer in place
taking the wall not over decay laura
mercier translucent powder and just
packing that underneath her eyes then
going in with the australia's fresh and
flawless face powder in the shade medium
tan which is the darkest and just use
not to set the rest of her foundation
I'm just taking that same transition
shade as we used in the crease earlier
on her lower lash line just with a sort
of narrow e sort of blending brush it's
kind of similar to the Max u17 but just
a little bit more dense I seriously
can't remember where the Freak this
brush is from everyone always asked me
got it sent to me ages ago and I just
been using it ever since and then I'm
just going in with the Maybelline eye
studio black liner just to put in her
waterline and then I'm just grabbing at
some of the dark brown and mixed it was
a bit of the black just to use to smoke
out that liner as well then going in
with the shimmery shade from the palette
and placement in the inner corners but
of course that wasn't dramatic enough
for me so I took the hooter beauty 3d
eyeshadow no highlighter palette and
placed that on the inner corners as well
that is taking at the mascara on her
lower lashes and for bronzer I'm taking
the NARS casino bronzer just on an
angled brush this one's by spectrum
cosmetics and just placing that on her
cheek area around the perimeters of a
forehead and then down the sides of her
nose as well
and then of course taking hoola by
benefit just using that on the brush it
came with actually I'm obsessive this
brush it's so good and just placing that
in the hollows of her cheekbones then
taking some Laura Mercier translucent
powder again just to bake underneath the
contour to make it nice and crisp and
defined then I'm taking the Gilda
blush by knives and pretty sure that's
what it's called if it's not I'll leave
it listed down below placing that on her
cheeks and then I tried the Smashbox
it's the collab with Casey Holmes I'm
not sure if I like it it wasn't as
pigmented as I thought it would be I
don't know I just love an intense
highlighted it wasn't like blinding like
the ones that I use but it was still
like really nice and then gave a really
nice glow to the face but yeah it just
wasn't like intense
then taking the Gerard cosmetics share
lipliner
I literally can't live without these lip
liners they're literally my favorite in
the whole world I have a discount code
if you want to use it and get fun for
your kit if you're a makeup artist or if
you're not a makeup artist and you need
some balm lip liners so good a level is
down below anyways for lips I decided to
use a gloss I use the anasazi Beverly
Hills toffee lip gloss so good and then
to set I use the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and that is the final look
done I hope you guys enjoyed watching
I'm getting back into filming myself
