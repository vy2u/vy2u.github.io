welcome back to my channel so today's
video is going to be of the look in the
thumbnail ever since I did this shoot
with Studio mink everyone was obsessed
with the makeup that I did so I thought
I would film it by the way how freaking
gorgeous is Lily oh my god she's only 16
oh whoops I forgot to tell you what I
was doing okay so I just used Mesilla
water on a cotton pad just remove all
the dirt and everything off her face I'm
not saying that her face was dirty but I
always do it before clients just to
ensure that everything's nice and clean
then I spread a face with the drug
cosmetics lay all day setting spray and
then I'm just applying the Mac Studio
Fix fluid in nw20 and just applying that
evenly over her face and then buffing it
out with a damp Beauty Blender even
though she doesn't even need foundation
because her face is already flawless I
can't believe she's 16 I legitimately
looked like a foot when I was 16 like
I'm gonna actually put a photo of what I
look like when I was 16 I actually
remember that exact day I took that
picture I just got back from the
hairdresser's and I thought I was
killing it those brows oh and the lip
color actually what was I just thinking
with my makeup in general to be honest
and then there's Lily perfect in every
single way I just can't wait to see what
she's gonna look like when she's 22 like
if she looks like this at 16 what is she
gonna look like at 22 honestly please
don't forget me when you're famous I
should probably get back to the makeup
tutorial so I'm putting the Maybelline
fit me concealer in light underneath her
eyes to conceal even though she doesn't
need concealing and highlighting and
then blending it out with a damp Beauty
Blender as per always but before that I
go down her forehead down the bridge of
my nose Cupid's bow and on her chin
and then I'm doing the little lines next
to a mouth to help with contouring I
find that it actually really does help
like if you guys are struggling with
contouring and I would definitely
recommend trying this little tip or
trick because it like really sets a
guide to where you should contour after
you blend it out and everything so yes
and now I am blending everything out
with my Beauty Blender
and then I'm just priming her eyelids
just using the Maybelline fit me
concealer again and I'm just blending
that out with a small like kabuki style
brush
and then I'm baking her concealer with
the laura mercier translucent powder as
per usual just on the same damp Beauty
Blender and then sitting the rest of her
face with the Australis fresh and
flawless face powder in natural
and then I'm just setting her eyelids
with a transferred powder I'm pretty
sure I just used the laura mercier one
just so that the eyeshadows blend easier
and yeah and then of course to bronze
and contour I'm using hoola benefit and
I'm just using that on a spectrum
cosmetics brush and it has very quickly
become one of my favorite bronzing
brushes ever as you can see I'm just
applying that into her cheekbones along
her jawline temples um
underneath her lip nose and then just
don't know forehead a little bit
and then I'm using the Milani baked
blush in Luminoso how stunning is that I
pretty much use it on every client just
because I find it so versatile and just
works well in every single skin tone I
absolutely love it it's so cheap as well
and then for highlighter i'm using the
becca cosmetics champagne pop one of my
favorites as well and I'm just placing
that on her cheekbones on her Cupid's
bow on the tip of her nose and then just
a little bit above and below her brows
so they're brows I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Pro brow palette and I'm
just going to use soft Brown just on the
pony cosmetics eyebrow brush and yet
again she's gifted with amazing eyebrows
so I didn't really do much I just kind
of filled in the sparse areas and then
just set it with a brow gel
so for a shadow I'm using creme brulee
from makeup geek cosmetics just as a
transition shade and just buffing that
into her crease
so if you want something to hold on so
now define it first the here show me and
then I'm going in with Blanc single
eyeshadow by anastasia beverly hills and
just placing that on the inner corner of
her eyes and then taking a brown from
the tartlet palette i'll leave it on the
screen I'm just using my Mac two one
seven brush by the way if you don't have
this brush unit in your life right now
it's like the best blending brush ever
I'm just concentrating that color in the
outer V's and blending it out
by the way I know this eye makeup look
may look similar to the bridal inspired
makeup look I did with Brooklyn but it
was such a requested makeup look when I
did the studio mint girls and so I
thought why not use the model that I
actually used on the day for the makeup
tutorial and I just thought it just
looked amazing on her so that's why I
put it I know it is similar to the other
one but I still love the way it turned
out
oh and by the Wizzle I'm just blending
everything out just with a large fluffy
brush and then I'm just going in like
with the Mac to 1-7 adding more product
blending it out you know the drill
and then I'm just adding a little bit
more of the Blanc eyeshadow that we use
before just to intensify the whiter
shade just because it got a little bit
lost in the blending process and then
I'm just lining her would align with the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner in black
and then I just used that Brown from the
tartlet palette to smoke it out with a
tapered blending brush
outside I don't want always would love
those witches leading us and then I'm
taking the drug cosmetics grace
highlighter and I'm just using that to
highlight the inner corners and her brow
bone
and then for winged liner I use the
tarte cosmetics clay paint liner in
black and the brush that I'm using is a
zoeva winged liner brush
the way melodies we haven't played now I
don't know
go in around these walls to create a
song
and then I'm just cutting her lashes
with mascara and the mascara I used was
the benefit they're real
and then for lashes I use the model rock
lashes in the style - one - I actually
have a little mini how to put lashes on
a client mini tutorial in my last Bridal
video so if you would like to learn then
definitely check that one out so yeah
I'm just applying the lashes and what a
different lashes make seriously I love
lashes very much and then I'm just using
a liquid liner this one's just the next
one or NYX however you pronounce it I
just couldn't be bothered to wait for
the glue to dry so I just went over the
top of her lash line and then I'm just
using that mascara wand again just to
blend her real lashes with the falsies
so Philip lino I use the gerard
cosmetics nude lip liner and then for
lipstick i used the velvet teddy by mac
and then i just stuck a clear gloss over
the top i can't actually remember which
one i used i think it was by Rimmel and
it's actually one of my fave glosses
ever so this is the end of the tutorial
I hope you guys enjoyed watching and
don't forget to give me a thumbs up if
you did and by the way I did want to
include the dark lip which was
originally the makeup for the studio
make photo shoot just in here so you
guys can see what the darker Vampir lip
looks like personally I think I like the
nude lip with the eyes but you could
definitely pull off a dark lip with the
eye makeup as well so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
