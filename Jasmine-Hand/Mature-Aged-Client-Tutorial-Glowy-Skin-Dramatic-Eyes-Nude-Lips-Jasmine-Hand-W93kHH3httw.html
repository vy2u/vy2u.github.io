today's client tutorial is going to be
of this look on my beautiful mum I went
for a super glowy complexion with a more
going-out type eye makeup I just had
heaps of people requesting it so I
thought I may as well do like a dramatic
eye nude lip glowy skin I just think it
looks absolutely amazing I hope you guys
enjoy watching and I'm just going to get
straight into it so the primer I like to
use the benefit Porefessional I just
find that this primer works really well
because mature aged clients tend to have
more open pores and I find that this
primer works really well in filling them
in so yeah and then I'm just spraying
her face a bit of mac fix+ and she hated
the smell for some reason I was like
what the hell it is the best smell ever
anyways I'm using the Mac Studio Fix
fluid in nw20 and I've just used one and
a half pumps on our face and I've just
evenly distributed and then I'm just
going to blend it in
and then to concealer underneath our
eyes I'm just using my Maybelline fit me
concealer in the lighter shade and as
you can see I'm just popping it
underneath her eyes a little bit on her
forehead down the bridge of her nose
Cupid's bow and a little bit on her chin
and then also blending it out and before
you guys freak out I actually gave this
concealer to my mom it's actually my
personal concealer she didn't have one
so I was like you can have it cuz I've
got about 80,000 backups of it anyways
but yeah then I'm just blending that all
out and then I go on to pop some on the
eyelids because I just like to use it as
a eye base like I don't really tend to
use eye primers unless I remember to use
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot but honestly I
don't think it's worth the money like I
think that little pot is like what
thirty five dollars I hardly use it I
just always use concealer and then I
just set it with a powder and it's good
to go so yeah that's just a little tip
okay this next step is so important so
when I when this one was like what are
you doing and I was like setting your
concealer so it doesn't create she was
like oh is that why my undereyes Cree so
bad like duh you have to you have to set
your concealer if you are putting
concealer underneath your eyes like you
just have to do it otherwise it'll
literally just look like you've aged ten
years like you have to set it doesn't
have to be like you don't have to bake
it just set it with any powder if you
just have like a face powder set it with
that because it'll make the biggest
difference I just had to quickly add
that in so I did actually bake with the
laura mercier translucent powder and
then I set the rest of her face with the
Australis for a fresh and flawless in
natural and then I don't like to keep
the baked on for too long so I just
wiped off the excess um after I set the
rest of her face and then two bronze I'm
using hoola by benefit obviously I
didn't really want a strong contoured
look I don't think it really looks nice
on my mum like I don't think she suits
it um so yeah I just did like a soft I
kind of contoured I didn't really like
define her cheeks but like I did bronze
them up she doesn't really like the
whole contoured look anyway so that's
why I decide to do this and I'm using
the mac 135 brush to do so
so the brows you probably already notice
that they're already on fleek that's
because she's gotten cosmetic eyebrow
tattoos as well so I just kind of went
over it with the blonde powder from the
a BH pro brow palette and I just kind of
like went over the bits that have faded
just from the powder and stuff like that
so I didn't really do much to the brows
so the blush I'm using the balm
cosmetics hot mama blush and this blush
is seriously bomb if you want like a
glowy pink blush it's seriously it's so
amazing and I found that it worked
amazing with the look that I was going
for so now I'm highlighting the absolute
 out of her face using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills so Hollywood highlighter I
need to pick up like another ten or
fifteen of them because it's literally
the only highlighter I use now apart
from the mary lou manizer but yet
honestly if you're looking for a good
highlighter then I would 100% recommend
this one okay for eyeshadow I just used
my Z palette with makeup geek and uh
nostalgia beverly hills eyes shadows so
i'm just going in with creme brulee just
in the crease and as you can see i'm
just using like windscreen wiper motions
and placing that as a transition shade
into her crease as always this is like
my number one go-to transition color and
then I'm going in with whimsical by
makeup geek
it's a foiled eyeshadow it's so amazing
this is basically the eyeshadow I use
when I do like the gradient I like the
light to dark everyone always asked is
other that shimmer shimmer or soft gold
by Anasazi Beverly Hills but I really
really like whimsical and now I'm using
fudge by a BH and I'm just placing that
on the outer V of her eye just using a
blending brush doing that to the other
eye make sure you don't go above the
crease like because that's when it's
going to look like you got punched in
the face or the eyeshadows just gone
wrong so just make sure you keep the
color underneath the crease if you
wanted it to make it smoky use a lighter
color to blend the crease up rather than
using a darker color to blend the crease
up if that makes any sense at all
so then to line the waterline I'm using
the Maybelline gel liner in black and
yes it's safe for those that are asking
I've used gel liner in the waterline
figures it's amazing if you haven't
tried it I would definitely recommend it
as opposed to like pencil liners and
then I'm just smoking out her lower lash
line using fudge by anastasia beverly
hills just on a more tapered brush and
then I am coating her top and bottom
lashes with the pony cosmetics white
night mascara which has really quickly
become my favorite for clients like it's
really good I'm obviously using that on
a disposable mascara wand and then the
lashes that I used I'm pretty sure there
were a thousand hours I've got them aged
as good that has been sitting in my
drawer they're a bit too natural for my
liking but I thought that they looked
really really nice on mum so I decided
to wear them I'll leave the style down
below because I can't remove it from the
top of my head but yeah I'm just using
the House of lashes lash glue and then
those lashes and then coating her bottom
lashes and then for lips I'm using the
essence I'm pretty sure it's just called
cute pink lip liner and then the
lipstick I use was angel by Mac which is
like one of my most popular lipsticks
ever and then over the top I just went
over with a Mac clear lip gloss
so there you have it I hope you guys
