channel so today's video is yes another
swatch video and today i'll be swatching
the new mellow cosmetics liquid lip
paints which look like this I'm so
excited to try them ever since I've seen
Chen EXO swatch video I was like I need
to swap these on camera for the first
time and then they just have their four
lipsticks that looks like this they have
just changed the packaging to this
really gorgeous like matte gray mode
with like the gold I think it looks
stunning and as far as the liquid
lipstick packaging it's just in a clear
tube with a gold lid which i think is
really really nice and the applicator is
just normal doe foot applicator that
liquid lipsticks usually have so the
formula of these lipsticks are like so
creamy it's a joke like I used to be
obsessed with the nude color if you've
been following me for ages this used to
be like my go-to lip color I'll just
swatch it now on my hand it's just like
such a mead color it's like a movi pinky
purpley color really really similar to
brave actually by Mac and these formulas
of these lipsticks are amazing they're
super creamy to super pigmented and
really long-lasting as well the formula
of the mellow liquid lipsticks I
actually have trialed a few of these
already and I fell in love the formula
as soon as I put it on it just goes on
like really really wet looking super
super pigmented actually really really
love that red color I haven't tried it
on yet but yeah really long-lasting
actually and they're really comfortable
and lips like they don't dry true matte
and they're not tacky so it's kind of
like a win-win because I absolutely hate
having like matte lips that feel like
you know like they're just about to
crack but these feel really really
comfortable at the lips so anyways I
hope you guys enjoy the swatches I'm
just going to get straight into it now
thank you so much for watching and don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and check out my other
cosmetics if you feel like it I think
I'll have a discount code and I'll link
it down below for you guys if you're
interested
yeah I'm just going to get start on to
the swatches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
