of like fitness journey video how I

like for those that don't already know I
live on the Gold Coast and I trained at
the Robina f45

you want more information about that f45
is actually a franchise so there's so
many here on the Gold Coast and even in
like Sydney Melbourne Brisbane they're
everywhere now though we're currently in
an 8 weeks challenge and it's week six I
think so two more weeks left thanks God
they have an awesome meal plan for the
eight week challenge that I've been
really trying to stick to I will also
show you guys like what I would usually
eat in a day and show you guys some
recipes from the meal plan as well
though I'm about to pull up so yeah I
will see you guys you know
so as most of you already know I'm off
to Europe later on this year and I'm
actually going to Tomorrowland and I

for you guys in this vlog because it's
so exciting I'm so excited
