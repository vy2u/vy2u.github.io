hey everyone welcome back to my channel
so in today's video I decided to do my
everyday makeup routine now I don't wear
makeup every single day but if I were to
go to the movies or lunch or running
errands or if I just want to wear makeup
and I don't really have that much time
and then this is the makeup look that I
go for all the products that I use are
pretty much my Holy Grail products and
just products that I reach for every day
so if you like to see how I created this
everyday makeup look then please keep
watching
so for primer I like the model code face
base primer it's just a silicon based
primer and it's really really hydrating
I'm the first time I put on my skin it
felt like it feels like oil like it
feels like we're going on your skin and
you're probably thinking why would I
want will on my skin I already have oily
skin a lot just came out but I
feel that every time I wear this my
foundation over the top just looks so
flawless and it lasts all day so that's
why I like it if your foundation I tend
to lean towards the covergirl 3 and 1 um
stay fabulous foundation and it is
seriously the best one of the best
foundations I've ever used in my life
however I've only lasts up to 4 to 5
hours on my skin but literally every
time I wear that foundation someone
complements my skin like it just looks
so flawless so full coverage which is
what I like I don't tend to go for BB
creams or CC creams as you can see I
don't have the best skin ever so I like
to wear foundation on a daily basis but
that's just my own personal preference
so I'm going to go ahead and mix 8 5 7
8:42 which are the two darkest colors
because I am fake tan and this one is
really really dark so I'm just going to
pump a few pumps out whoops I'm using
the original beauty blender this is just
what works best for me and I absolutely
love it it is quite pricey I think it's
like $30 or something but I do have the
chichi sponges that are like five
dollars or something and they are pretty
good as well so I would recommend those
if you're not willing to spend $30 on
this one so as you can see I'm just
bouncing that all over my face as I
always would I just think the color of
these foundations are like made for
people that tan I swear to god they are
so smart also the price of my snapchat
asking you guys if you would like to see
like a half and half drugstore and
high-end makeup tutorial and I wasn't
going to do that for my everyday makeup
tutorial just because I figured I never
use high-end products anyways so I just
decided to go ahead and just stick with
the products that I actually use
everyday instead of having to pick out
drugstore alternatives but I'll
definitely do a video of like a smoky
eye or something like that with half um
drugstore and half high-end so yeah okay
so now that that's done I'm going to go
in with my favorite under-eye concealer
it is the Maybelline fit me in the
lightest shade and I'm just putting that
underneath my eyes seriously this is my
favorite concealer like I I have the
NARS one and I have Urban Decay one and
nothing compares to this and it's not
even half the price
I actually don't know what I would do
without this concealer so now I'm just
blending that in so lately what I've
been using to set my concealer is the
face of Australia transition powder
which is what I use to bake so I'm just
using that on my elf blush brush which I
got from I think it was Kmart and it was
like eight dollars it's so good for
setting your concealer don't now I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
with my favorite setting powder it is
your strollers fresh and flawless in
darkest brown if you've been watching
all my videos I swear I just use this in
every single video because I absolutely
love it
so for bronzer I'm going to use the
Dallas by benefit it's literally the
best bronze I've ever used and I've only
had it for like how long have I use this
five days and it's already become my
favorite so I've been using this one
every single day okay so now I'm going
to go in with my number one contour
product this is the first box that I
have and I'm almost done like this has
lasted me I would say good two years and
it still hasn't given up on me so I'm
just going to use the brush that it came
with which is by the way amazing and
contour my cheeks
so for blush I'm going in with Milani
baked blush in Luminoso I absolutely
love this doesn't really look too much
like I love how it's blobby and it's not
just like a pink matte blush so for
highlighter i usually use the mary lou
lou manizer by the balm it's just my
favorite highlighter in the whole wide
world
but I thought I would show you guys what
champagne pop which is the recent
collaboration with Jacqueline Hill here
on YouTube so I thought I would put this
one on today I have opal and I freaking
love it so I really really hope that
this one is as good I haven't used it
yet so I'm for work food
dead that is a definition of highlight
on fleek holy hell
so to contour my nose I'm going to use
the hoola again and contour down beard
further my nose also just a tip when
contouring your nose don't go like this
and contour your nose because I've seen
so many people do that and it actually
makes your nose look bigger so what I
like to do I don't want to say it's the
right way but the way that it looks the
best is just doing it literally let down
the bridge and then what I like to do is
grab my highlighter and just use my
finger to put down the bridge laughter
so for eyes I just go super simple I'm
just grabbing creme brulée by makeup
geek which is just a really soft brown
color and all I'm doing is placing that
into my crease this is such a the
easiest buy look anyone could ever do so
then I'm just going to darken the crease
a little bit I'm just going to use Coco
bear just the slightest bit kind of
aiming that towards my outer corner so
on my lid I've started to use like loose
pigment so I'm going to place this
pigment from makeup addiction cosmetics
it's called the snow gold light
reflective loose powder brush that I'm
going to use is just a really um thin
sort of flat shader brush and then I'd
like to spray some elf mist and set
which is really cheap compared to the
fix+
alright so I'm going to grab a little
bit of the pigment and actually
placing that on my lid this looks really
like dramatic right now but I swear to
you once I like blend it out it won't so
I'm just blending the pigment sort of
color into my crease so it's not as
harsh so I've kind of toned it down a
little bit and blended that into my
crease so I'm just going to go ahead and
place it on my other lid so the
eyeshadow should look something like
that just really really super simple but
what I'm going to amp it up with is my
winged liner I literally couldn't do
makeup without it and when I do in my
opinion I think I look so weird
so the eyeliner that I use is the
Maybelline eye studio in the gel pop
form and I'm using it on a sigma angled
brow brush I like to do like a medium
sort of wing so I like to start the tail
map out the wing
and then just connect it and yeah
recently I've been stopping about 3/4 of
the way in and I feel like when I put my
eyeliner all the way to the inner
section on my eye it makes my eyes look
smaller and like really beady when my
eyes actually really big so I like to
accentuate that so I'm just finishing
off the eyeliner like here
so my wings are on and now I'm going to
line my waterline and I like using nudes
and my waterline because one it's I
think what suits me better than black
and true it makes your eyes look a lot
brighter and bigger so that is what I
like to achieve I'm using the bomb mr.
right now in Brian but I absolutely love
the Rimmel exaggerate nude liner so then
for the bottom to even out the eyeshadow
I'm just going to grab creme brulée
again and just lightly I'm smoking out
the bottom a little bit just so it's not
completely blank mascara I'm going to
use my favorite essence mascara it is
called I love extreme this one's my
favorite now I'm just going to coat my
top lashes so you could totally finish
the eye look just by wearing mascara but
I'm just going to go that one step
further and put some lashes on and these
ones are the K luxe lashes in Maria
so for lipliner I'm going to use the Mac
two lip liner which is one of my
favorites in the whole world then I'm
going to go in with brave which is my
all-time favorite lip color
so here you have it here is my everyday
makeup routine I hope you guys enjoyed
it and if you do please give my video a
big thumbs up and I will see you in my
next video bye guys
you spent all that time cream contouring
but I'm just going to go ahead and set
my face with powder and then powder
contour so why not just powder contour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
