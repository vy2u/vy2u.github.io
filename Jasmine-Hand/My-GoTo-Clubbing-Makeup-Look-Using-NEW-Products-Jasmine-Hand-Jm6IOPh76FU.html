so in today's video I have done my go
through clubbing blend every single time
I go clubbing and I post on snapchat you
guys always reply and say you need to do
a video on this look so basically all I
do want to go clubbing is just do like a
brown blown-out smokey eye just because
it doesn't take long at all it's super
easy but I hope you guys enjoy watching
and get straight into it
so if I start I'm going to go ahead and
put on the Porefessional by benefit just
to kind of smooth everything out it's
work so well smoothing out textured
parts of the face I am getting a bit of
a breakout here and it's so annoying
because I never usually get breakups
anymore but I'm trying new skincare I
don't know why my skin was fine before
but I got sent this stuff I think it's
called skin stitute and I've heard
really good things about it and all my
friends have said it's good so I'm just
switching over to that but I don't know
if it's normal to like break out when
you start a new skincare anyways
that's the current situation right now
I did actually recently receive these
new Australis liquid like liquid
illuminating drops which I might mix in
with my foundation so this one's in the
shade of gold and I also wanted to try
the new L'Oreal infallible total cover
foundation I got sent three shades so
hopefully if I mix and match it's going
to match me I don't actually have any
faith Han at the moment I know how weird
I actually went out into the Sun and go
to ten I usually wouldn't go out in the
Sun because I'm so scared of getting
like skin cancer or whatever so I'm just
prefer to fake tan but I've been to the
beach a lot this summer and yeah I've
got a bit of a color so for then I'm
going to mix these two shades 32mb
I am 21 golden sand and the looks really
dark and I think gotten turned up a
little bit true Lila you just put some
then I'm going to add a drop of as if
from the stroller you can see accuracies
one of these brushes by iconic recently
and I've really been interested in
trying it but I'm going to try and blend
my foundation in with depth okay I need
a mirror so unorganized alright let's
see how this foundation matches okay off
the bat it's pretty full coverage I can
tell it is a little bit pinky tone but
when going with this
kind of coming out a bit gray tones in
real life but color match isn't actually
too bad I thought it would be much worse
this brush is so soft
now I'm going to go in with the drew the
hoola by benefit which is just a liquid
version of the pressed powder it's going
to go in with the same brush and warm up
my face once you lose it work
you
circumstellar I'm going to use these to
face born this way in a light breath
think this might be a little bit too
light for my complexion so I'm going to
mix it in with the Maybelline fit me and
light because it's a little bit um the
no less warmer so I'm going to mix these
through together
yeah that is so right it's going through
like three little things with that and
then this is the Maybelline one kind of
like it mix them together like that
what actually works really well
just going to take a bit more concealer
so I was taking some laura mercier
translucent powder and using that
directly underneath to set the area so
it doesn't crease so pressed powder I've
actually found a new one it is the photo
bomb a powder foundation by the balm so
it looks like this is a shade medium I'm
not sure how well this is going to match
me so I'm talking to the best so far the
Kardashians look too bad so Brad I'm
just going to go in with my Anastasia
dip brow in a medium brown
then just taking it some Medellin fit me
concealer just on a at Cana Cielo brush
and just going to use that to define the
brows I'm going to use just going to
take the penny cosmetics zebra brow gel
it's actually really good actually holds
in the brows really well I think you
guys right up so you can see up close
and personal when I do my eyes so I
actually received these two palettes
from morphe the other week and I really
really want to use them because I'm
doing a brown smokey eye and well the
majority of these colors in the palettes
are brown so do you see 25b palette by
morphe absolutely stunning and go in
with this color first as my transition
shade so I'm just going to use that in
the crease and a bit above as well
because it will create the smokey effect
you always want to go in with a light
shadow first then work your way into the
darkest shadows so I see it as the more
colors you put on like the more shades
of Browns you put on the more seamless
and smokier it's going to look so this
is just a really really really light
brown for the transition if you don't
have like a defined crease just open
your eyes and just go above like this
because then at least you can kind of
see what it's going to look like with
your eyes open so that's the first color
I've put down then I'm going to go in
with a little bit of a darker but same
sort of toned shadows and just putting
that in the exact same places as we
placed the first color so you're slowly
building up the color
this is probably the easiest look
someone could do and quickest in my
opinion I always do this look when I go
out so taking a slightly denser blending
brush and I'm going to go in where oh my
god so many decisions okay I'm going to
go in pick this brown coming off the
excess and all I'm doing is just packing
that all over the mobile lid so
literally just there and you'll see
because of the transition colors that
you play it kind of already looks smoky
just kind of focusing on packing the
color on at the moment
I'm just easy not to blend into the
transition color as well I'm going to
add a little bit more Brown just to make
it a tad back off
okay so now the tops done I'm just going
to remove the under I've baked okay so
now if I underneath the lower lashes I'm
just going to take those first to
transition shape to start off with and
literally run that underneath I'm just
using that same blending brush we used
to pack on the collar
literally just creating two lines like
that then pop it on a bit too high I'm
going to take this shimmery color from
the palette looks so gorgeous it's like
a rose gold color I think and place that
in my inner corner full that is very
pretty
then for winged line I'm just going to
use the two-faced sketch marker and
create a wing because I literally can't
go out without a wing
okay so I've just zoomed you guys out
again I'm going to do my lashes and
stuff so I'm going to curl my lashes and
then I'm just putting my lashes with you
benefit roller lash one of my face and
scarves
before I pick some laughs of them I'm
going to put some gel liner in my
waterline as well
just to make it extra smokey on the
bottom so I'm just grabbing some of the
other stars your line on now I'm just
going to take this under stars via a one
brush it's just really really narrowed
taking that dark brown shade and I'm
just using that directly underneath
where we placed the gel liner in the
waterline just to smoke it out and a pop
on its when my favorite lashes these are
the huda beauty ones I can't remember
from this of my head what style they are
but I'll make sure I go online and have
a look and leave it in the description
for you guys because they are amazing
I'm pretty sure they're part of her Mint
collection because they're double
layered so nice so now on to face I'm
going to go in with the Marc Jacobs and
blush in the shade 506 that's what it
looks like stunning and I'm just going
to pop that on my cheeks and I want this
to blush but it's more of like a bronzer
to me like it looks very ronzi gonna
take some of the Mac give me son
and pop that pretty much everywhere I
feel like I need some bronze back into
my face so popping out my jewel one side
of my nose then I'm just going to take
some Laura Mercier powder for blush I'm
going to go in with the Too Faced sweet
peach glow palette so pretty I'm going
to take the middle shade and just pop
that on lucky and then while I have this
part amazed I'll use their highlighter
as well which is stunning I love it so
much it's so pigmented and placing that
on my cheekbone so pretty
so the lip call that I tend to usually
wear when I go out is just like a dusty
sort of pinky or maybe like even a dark
brown in color
I love having color on my lips I
couldn't ever go out without like a sort
of darkish lipstick so what I'm going to
use today is Zee what is this their
minerals Jen nude lip liner in the shade
vibe and yes they actually received
heaps of new more feet liquid lipsticks
so this one is in the shade suspect and
it's definitely a color that I would
lean towards so I'm going to put it to
the test it kind of smells like the
Kylie lip kits not gonna lie it's like
really familiar
okay I definitely looked a little bit
more pink on the lips but it's still
really pretty and easy to apply then
over the top because I've been recently
obsessed with glossy lip I'm going to
use the Papa don't teach by true face
you can see that
so this is the final look and hope you
guys enjoyed watching and if you did
