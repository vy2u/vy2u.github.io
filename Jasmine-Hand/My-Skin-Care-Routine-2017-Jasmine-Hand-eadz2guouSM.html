channel heaps of you guys have been
requesting a skincare routine type video
so today's video is going to be just
that I will be letting you guys know
what products I use how I use them and
what I use them with so if you would
like to see how I do my skincare
everyday then just keep on watching so
every week when I go to exfoliate I use
my vanity planet ultimate skin spa which
is just a electronic sort of cleansing
brush that comes with three different
heads the one that I like to use the
most is the silicon one and I use this
when I'm using my skin stitute glycolic
acid exfoliating scrub
and then I'm just putting some of the
glycolic acid scrub by skin stitute on
the brush and then gently working that
into my skin
I love the silicon brush the most
because it helps deep clean pores it
also removes excess oil but can cause
clogged pores it also prevents future
breakouts and obviously leaves the skin
healthier and lifts away dry dead skin
cells and it's really easy to clean
because it's really quick drying and no
bacteria builds up on them so then after
exfoliating I like to cleanse so I use
the skin stitute a lactic cleanser and I
like to change the brush heads for this
one I like to change the brush head to a
more softer one so it foams up on the
skin so I'm just attaching that onto the
brush there's also two levels of speed
on the brush as well and then I'm just
adding some of the cleanser onto the
brush and then again just working that
into my skin this brush head is so soft
I literally do this for ages just
because it feels so nice on my skin so I
just do that for a couple of minutes and
then wash it off
also any planet was nice enough to give
you guys a 70% off discount on one of
these brushes they're originally 125 but
you can get it down through $39 or leave
a link down below where you can buy one
if you like
so now on to serums and moisturizers so
I use this one called balance and this
is a serum it's a skin brightening serum
that I actually got from Australian skin
clinics when I got my laser done they
gave me a few skincare to prep my skin
for micro which I'm going to be getting
and then I'm going in with their
moisturizer as well I'll leave all the
products that they use down below but I
really really like these products
because they feel really like on my face
I don't really feel like I'm really
putting much product on which is what I
tend to look for in moisturizers and
serums so that is pretty much all I do
to my skin and I sometimes do a face
mask I like to use the glam glow ones
like once or even once every two weeks
but that is my current skincare routine
I hope you guys enjoyed watching and if
you did please don't forget to give it a
thumbs up for me and subscribe to my
channel for more videos and I'll see you
in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
