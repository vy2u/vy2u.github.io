channel so for today's video I thought I
would do a lip swatch video I haven't
done one of these in so long I remember
I used to do them so often back in the
day so I recently received the new huda
beauty like liquid mini pack things so
this one's the natural nudes and this
one's the power pinks and then I just
had two other colors but I also had that
weren't in the packs that i swatched for
you guys as well so if you'd like to see
what these beautiful nudes look like
swatched on my lips then just keep on
watching okay so I'm gonna start off by
swatching the natural nude palette so it
comes with four colors they are
girlfriend trendsetter sugar mama and
bikini babe I'm gonna go from lightest
to darkest this one is called a bikini
bag and I can already tell that it's
gonna be really light so I might go even
like a darker lip liner just to like I
don't know define my lips it because
this one looks really pale just gonna go
in with this Urban Decay glide on lip
pencil and line my lips first then I'm
going in with the candy babe I bought is
so pale but just actually not bad the
formula of these is so nice
I'm kind of like blending it in with the
lip liner as well I kind of feel like
this kind of color would look amazing on
a pale skin tones but because I'm quite
10 it kind of just like washes my lips
out to be completely honest I'm not
actually hating it like there's
something about it with the lip liner
that I really like like it's a really
obviously really nude it's not something
that I would typically wear but like I
don't know maybe you could use this with
an ombre lip so you're using like a
darker color and then this just dabbing
it in the middle like it is a really
nice color it's more like a peachy sort
of like nude but I really like it going
in with sugar mama now this one's a tad
darker so I'm probably not going to use
a lip liner and just go straight in oh
this is very nice
kind of feels like you're applying the
law set fast and then it dries matte
it's more of like a peachy like nude
color like it really complements my eye
makeup look actually played around with
a new coral obsessions palette I fell on
the eyes today no I just feel like this
is like a really really pretty nude and
obviously if you want your lips a little
bit more - fine then go in with a lip
liner but like I find it like works well
without a lip liner so that one was
sugar mama so next color is called trend
set up so I'm just gonna go in with this
color pop one and line my lips first
this one is really nice
oh my god I'm obsessed with that one
it's definitely more of a color I would
typically wear I'd rather like darker
sort of nude so yeah love that one the
last color from the Naxals palette is
called girlfriend
it's definitely got more of a peach yeah
like under turn
yeah that is a really nice color it's
definitely something that I would wear
like day to day it's not true light and
it's not true dark it's like the perfect
mood so I'm living for this color
now I'm gonna swatch the power pink set
super cute I might go from lightest to
darkest again I might just like my lips
again I'm just lining my lips is like
the same lip liner because I don't
really have much of a like defined lip
line so it kind of looks funny when I
apply like colors without any lip line
on so I'm just going to apply this oh
this is pretty
again very Coralie
it's pink but it's not like in-your-face
pink it's really soft but it has like
that coral sort of undertone I really
like this color
okay next car I'm gonna swatch is iconic
just gonna go over the lip line this
one's the Bel Air one by dry
oh this one's nice they gone so easily
because this one's icon I really like it
it's nothing that I would normally wear
like I did used to use brave a lot by
Mac which was a little bit similar but
this one is a little bit darker but I
really like it for like a bold but not
like true in-your-face type lip but like
I love the formula of days life doesn't
really feel like I'm wearing a liquid
lipstick like usually liquid lipsticks
can be very drying and uncomfortable the
lip that's why I tend to go for glosses
usually like on top of liquid lipsticks
or even lipsticks but it doesn't make
your lips look like dry or cracked it it
is actually making my lips look really
smooth and moisturized which is like
yeah really good for a liquid lipstick B
I'm living for this color I really like
it I might actually wear this one today
how did is final to college I'm gonna go
in with trophy wife I think this one is
actually really similar to the last one
it's just kind of more of a very sort of
look
my god I don't mind my horrible
application but that is trophy wife I
really like it it's again not really a
shame that I would typically like where
day to day or even like out I don't know
I just don't think I really suit like
deep pink colors but like I don't hate
it but I don't like I don't love it like
I'm not I just don't think it really
suits me as well as like other colors
okay the last color is called a Medusa
okay this looks like really perfectly so
I'm kind of scared okay I'm not gonna go
in with a lip liner it's definitely not
as pigmented as other colors like I like
I'm gonna have to go over it again it's
definitely a very unique color like it's
not something you know you wear every
day but I actually darn hate it like
there's something about this that I
really like like it's not true like what
the hell like have you gotten your lips
like it is more of like a gray sort of
purple but like yeah I'm kind of like
liking it I don't know what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
which color is your fav okay so I have
two more colors to it share with you
guys they are these shade bombshell and
news and actually receive these liquid
lipsticks as well but these ones already
in those little steps so there's only
two more left
I'm two more different colors left to
swatch so I'm gonna swatch Meuse guys
and allow my lips first oh my god yes
I love this color it's so pretty this is
definitely a color like I would wear
every day okay so the final color i'll
be swatching is called bombshell and I
have a feeling this is gonna be one of
my favorite so I'm just gonna line my
lips again with the Gerard cosmetics lip
liner then I'm gonna go in it with
bombshell okay Stephanie Nauta at four
it's definitely a lot lighter and then I
thought it would be
it is really peachy as well no that's a
bad thing but I just thought it'd be
like a dark brown so that is bombshell
and that is all the liquid lipsticks
that I have to swatch be you guys I hope
you guys liked this video and if you
want to see more swatch videos I
remember I used to do them so often back
in the day so if you guys want me to do
more videos like this then let me know
