- recently I got sent the most amazing
true faced PR package I have ever seen
in my life so I thought I would film
with it today this is what it looks like
you may have seen it on my Instagram
story and I was just blown away I was
like I'm never taking this makeup from
outside the box ever like it is just so
pretty like how could you
so basically they've come out with like
a range of new lipsticks they've got the
natural eyes eye shadow palette natural
face palette and then a natural matte
eyeshadow palette and then for bronzers
they already have them but then just put
them in your packaging so they're just
like the chocolate Soleil milk cell a
dark saala and then like the cocoa bunny
bronzer so they'll just put all those
existing bronzers that they had already
in their new collections packaging so
basically today I just decided to go all
matte on the eyes they haven't done like
an all matte a show look in forever
and obviously nude lip just to go with
the whole natural theme of this new
collection that's come out from Too
Faced so if you'd like to see how I
created this makeup look then just keep
on watching so a cup I'm gonna take the
hourglass mineral veil primer Oh
Sophie's table says this I don't even
know why I stopped like using it I've
just had so many like good primers come
and I've just been using them I guess in
the meantime but this one used to be
like my absolute going to bring back the
oh geez you know all over foundation
should I wear I'm gonna try and wear one
I haven't worn in a while so the
foundation I've been absolutely loving
lately is the new L'Oreal Paris
infallible Pro glow it's mainly designed
for I think with more dry skin because
it is quite glowy I have used it a few
times and I do yes go oily like after a
few hours but I do love how it looks
like straight after you apply and like
for this view out
until I have to powder so I'm going to
use this today I'm in the shade 204 so
I'm just gonna squirt some on my Beauty
Blender and just go ahead and apply it
can you guys believe I haven't faked an
is hope you like not once I have not
touched say ten and I still have my year
of ten oh I get her to go to Bali in
December so that would have just carried
on
yeah but hundreds fates hand I just
can't be bothered I hate sleeping in it
I hate top guards all over your sheet I
hate the smell I love the look at it but
I'm just so lazy right now I'm doing
quite a bit of bronzing cuz it's a
little bit light for me but the
concealer I try to look for one that I
haven't used recently in my videos so
this one is the Bobbi Brown instant full
cover concealer so I'm gonna pop that
under my eyes oh this is sorry thick
polish it this is more of like a spot
concealer
it's like not even coming out on the
brush
oh yeah that's not too bad I take some
more of the mecha max lifeproof
concealer and just use up to highlight
my face so I'm just gonna just do this
yeah yeah yeah and then just blend it
out I might try some cream contouring
today bit nervous cuz I'm sorry about
that
I swear to God like you either like can
do it what you heart yeah I think I'm
just one of those feet with that huh now
I've accepted that let's start off by
using the jus the whole lot just to warm
up my face and then I'll go in with some
light cream contouring sticks and stuff
I'm just kind of like work that into
this area
that looks quite nice on the cheeks
to be honest just gonna take my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and use that
just to bake underneath my eyes in the
meantime
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour ink sticks have it use these in
the wild I'm scared okay this one's in
the shade for one I have this shade in
the powder form and I like it so I'm
just gonna wing it
you know what's a bit dry
yeah looks a bit grey to me I'm like no
one looks like a dog I think this
one's like really gray
let's go on with me which is like a tad
darker I'm not just like put that with
it too it just looks so dark to me like
I freak out when I say like the eager is
I'm scared I'm like putting all these
Doc's drops in my face I'm just like
stop I just rather like to work with
less and noted hot rather than like
putting so much on your face and then
having to blend it out like it gives me
anxiety
I'm probably the only one that thinks
like that but yeah i'm we did alright
let's go try blend this out let's fight
this like it actually works because i
haven't used them in a while
and they're probably like really old my
use like this to try and it out
but it doesn't look bad on camera I'm
just in real life it kind of just looked
a bit muddy
I wouldn't tend to use this kind of
shade on my cheeks like I just rather
like contour with funders and stuff like
yeah it doesn't look bad I'm just like
not used to it I don't think maybe I'm
just like not using the right products
so if you guys have any recommendations
of that cream contouring products that
are easy to blend and to work with
let me know that's alright I guess I
mean I'm just gonna go over it with
wonders anyways so I don't know it just
doesn't really seem to be working for me
anyway but minna the rest of my face
with the Australian flawless this one's
in the shade medium tan if you did all
over my face I love it because it's so
full coverage so sometimes like when I'm
just rushing out the house I'll just put
this one because it is like a foundation
in itself so just add that extra
coverage on top of your like liquid
foundation and more coverage the better
for me but if you're not all about that
full coverage life and you want more of
a natural base then I'd probably suggest
using a translucent powder or something
over the top because that won't give
like the effect of like such a cake
thanks but I'm guilty of that because I
am and I'll admit it I'm just like not
that girl that can do like really
natural glam like I'm like I can do it
but I'd rather either wear no makeup or
if I'm about to do okay I'm gonna go in
with bronze in my face with the new Too
Faced star
so basically in this box you get four
bronzes well I don't actually know if
this box is available to buy I probably
should have liked to research that but
anyways in this box they have all their
bronzes that they already have that just
have it in different packaging so this
one's the dark chocolate bronzer this
one's the chocolate Soleil this one is
Sun bunny and then this one is milk
chocolate so I think I might use hmm I
don't know
well obviously not dark chocolate I
might just use the chocolate Soleil
to bronze and then I might just put a
bit of oh wait do they have a cheekbone
as well hold on hold on hold on they
also have a natural face palette which
is new oh my god I can't I have new
shades I think this is what it looks
like it definitely looks a lot lighter
on the screen than in real life but
they're pretty like warm is sort of
bronzer shades like that's a little bit
better warmish bronzer shades a
highlighter a highlighter and a blast I
might take the top shade which is called
Sun honey I hate running the pattern on
like pretty stuff and I'm just going to
use that to bronze oh my god this
palette is hot get over it
that phones it's really pretty as well
I'm just gonna put a little bit on the
sides but my nose and then underneath
here I love that I'm gonna take a little
bit of tropic light it's hot which is a
tad darker I'm just gonna use that like
right like that just to get that like
snaps look now I'm going to take some
translucent powder and a base I'm just
using the face of Australia translucent
powder for this just because it I'd like
to link my alarm sk1 it's just a bit
cheaper and I find it works like pretty
well like anyways the blush I might as
well just use the one in the palette
it's super pretty it's called pink wink
which is that and just poking that whoa
that is pigmented as okay okay
that is freaking pigmented I'm not much
of a blush fan like I love like the
littlest bit but not like crazy okay
that is pigmented AF just a few people
ask me if I've had cheek Phyllis and I'm
just like no hon I just have a fat face
I've always had like chubby cheeks okay
that is a lot of blush to what I'm used
to but I'm unlocking it for something
different
thanks for holiday I'm gonna take satin
sheets which is this one I'm gonna take
it on a more like smaller blending brush
just because I kind of got a bit more
precision with that that is
that's nice it's like goldie reflux how
can i wrote it it reminds me so much of
the unreason but it's just a little bit
more like a yellow Goldy
that is absolutely blinding probably a
little bit much on but oh so I'm going
to take the natural matte palette and
I'm gonna take oh that's just like a
little bit much or two color I'm gonna
take this shape which is called au
natural or natural and I'm just gonna
start off by using that in my crease for
a transition color I'm thinking I'm like
doing that I it's something different so
I'm always like doing shimmer actually
one of my clients the other week
requested a matte eye and actually
really good on her I did like a really
subtle cut crazy night and then like
dark brown on the edges so I recreate
that by the way this brush is from
makeup addictions cosmetics I use a
range I always get asked what brushes I
use I use heaps of different brands I
use makeup addictions cosmetics and
mainly like Sigma and zoeva and then
some Real Techniques brushes as well and
spectrum cosmetics so they're like the
main brush brands that I use then I'll
take the shade hookup which is a good
sort of coppery orangey color that's
what I've always use and just using that
in my crease as well I've had no fallout
so far from these eyeshadows which is
good
two-faced peach palette it has a really
bad fall out like you definitely have to
do your eyes first if you're using that
palette but yeah this one is really nice
and blending really easy I'm just gonna
take this luxe petit crease brush by Zoe
bar and I'm gonna take sexpert which is
right here
can you use that like mainly on the
inner corner
look here because then when we cut the
crease it'll just look a little bit more
defined it's like darker you see what I
mean like when I'm done all right so I
think I've built up that color good oh
yes I'll leave that for now I'm gonna
take that same color sexpert and use
that on the outer corners just to build
up the color just kind of like that
just blending those edges our I'm going
to take the first transition shade again
which is au natural
just on that same brush with the darker
product okay I'm gonna see a little bit
of pickup which was that bird sort of
brownie color copy and although putting
that in my outer corner I'm gonna take
some concealer I'm just gonna take the
make a Max one know what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna grab a concealer brush this
one is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
concealer brush and a little bit of my
concealer and I'm just going to start
out by cutting the crease so what you
want to do is look forward find your
crease and I like to go a bit above it
because it kind of gives the illusion of
a bigger like eyelid space and then
filling it in sorry I literally can't
talk bandwidth okay
and kind of just blend that in with that
I shudder
all right this brush is like a little
bit of gold on that oh well then I'm
taking the palette and I'm just taking
that white shade and really packing on
that wipes to set the concealer oh my
god this Y is so pigmented
actually received this in the mail the
other day it's own models own which is
quite an affordable brand here in
Australia yeah it's just a models own
color creme eyeshadow and I've been
using this in my inner corners recently
so pretty I just love that like metallic
unicorn AHA leather look I'm gonna take
the highlighter that we used and pop it
in the inner corner oh my god I'm so
done okay so the island I'm just gonna
take the mellow precision pen lineup
I've been loving this one recently I'm
just going to create a wing
calm down
fumus car I'm just going to pop on the
benefit bad gal bang okay I'm going to
pop on lashes now
so these about the brand slay lashes and
I think they're in this doll when we see
okay oh my god I'm obsessed with the eye
okay now into lips I'm gonna zoom you
guys out a bit I have like fifty
thousand two shades from right so I'm
gonna break these are the lip colors I'm
thinking I might do something like noon
maybe like pinky that's frickin pretty
okay strip-searched you can't really see
it that well as funds I think more of
like it I know this one's way lighter
maybe not that one this one called
birthday Street which is a bit darker
yep sold using the Urban Decay glide on
lip pencil in the shade up tight and
lining my lips with that wait did I find
out my Cupid's bow
okay then I'm gonna go in with the
lipstick this one's in the shade at
birthday suit that is so pretty I'm
gonna put some gloss on so I'm just
gonna pop on the true face melted latex
but it's just a clear lip gloss it looks
a bit murky cuz I use it all the time
I'm like obsessed with how this turned
out
like it's still glam but it's not like
whoa you know so that's the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed watching and if
