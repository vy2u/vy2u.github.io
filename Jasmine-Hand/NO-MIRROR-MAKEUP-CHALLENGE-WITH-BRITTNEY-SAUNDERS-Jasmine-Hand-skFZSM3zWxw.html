in today's video me and Brittany
Saunders here on YouTube as well
obviously you would already probably
know who with this bitch is now we
filmed the no makeup no no no makeup
makeup challenge we actually created
this look using food No so we filmed
ain't no mirror makeup challenge and
this is our result I'm actually quite
impressed with yours
to be honest I really didn't think
you'll pull through I probably give this
better than I do normal man I'm not
gonna lie yeah so if you'd like to see
how we created this wonderful makeup
actually yeah will you just keep
watching so I'm gonna start out with my
it cosmetics number 50 blah blah primer
I'm just gonna start off with my steel
ones don't know Forever Young to do this
those are gonna be so funny the prime is
the hardest bit by Real Techniques I'm
going to use the covergirl outlast three
one I'm gonna mix these two shades
that's so I'm just taking that oh well
where do you look I don't know would you
rather do this for the rest of your life
what have no mirror yeah oh and your
eyebrows tattooed on
not have my eyebrows turning on
obviously okay would you rather do this
forever yeah
or have a mirror but only be allowed to
do one makeup look every day for the
rest your life what do you mean only one
look you can't like change the hours I
rather think I'm going to use my hands
to make sure no that's cheating
why do want you to here's what a normal
day today okay so I think I've done my
foundation I don't think so
me no I don't think I'm done so I'm
gonna move on to concealer and I'm using
my Mac Pro Longwear in NC 20 is that to
get rid of the suitcase it's under my
eyes I'm going to use my NARS radiant
creamy concealer for the eyes and then
I'm gonna highlight down the center of
my face
I'm gonna set my concealer with the
laura mercier translucent powder I'm
going to set my under eyes with the
yellow powder from anastacio tablet I
just feel like my face is just no
way you're going through menopause a I
think so we're gonna use dark eyeshadows
as well
he's my phone's to war now anything this
means the same thing too except this is
a natural which it won't be my color
what nothing
what have I done nothing then moving on
to contouring you need this this is
gonna be the hardest sister nah I don't
even care
I'm just gonna do it and pretend I could
see for the easiest fit nose contour be
joking
whoa it's happening well jazz is
doing that I'm gonna highlight I'm just
going to use my Mac soft and gentle
which is pretty flippin easy you're
gonna bake yeah I'm kind of a couple
laughs okay so I'm gonna base my contour
because I don't really do anything yeah
yeah you'll see in a second
and this can turn out really good or
really dealing where your face is good
I'm gonna contour my nose
how's my nose contour
I don't really say anything tell me
honest playing it safe over you yeah
don't play it safe go all out I am I'm
doing exactly what I would do in a
normal day I'm gonna get this morphe
palette like the 3-6 Oh palette and you
can use my coat which is I don't
have a code
everyone else does they feel a friend
okay one I'm gonna use this Carly stuff
I benefit blush just around on my
eyelids I'm going to take a brownie warm
shade this is when it gets hot yeah I'm
gonna put that on my honours he's put
the worst brush to you is okay I'm just
gonna use transition shade gosh I was
really good at chess I can't say it
you're not dipping the product in you
just sang that so I it up even more
no I want to use that copper 800 so
we're gonna take that finger
then I'm just gonna blend my eyes I feel
like I'm putting nothing on because I
can't see you know what I mean
