today's video is going to be another lip
swatch video and I'm going to be
swatching the new NYX lingerie liquid
lipsticks so I thought I'd do something
a little bit different so as i'm
swatching the liquid lipsticks i'm going
to do like a voice over and explain how
i use shopping box how much everything
was and like a little bit of a review on
the liquid lipsticks so yeah I'm just
going to get straight on to the swatches
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up and comment below what you would like
to see next on my channel and I guess
I'm just going to get straight into the
swatches so I'm back it's me again and I
just want to say firstly Happy Easter
it's actually Easter Sunday the day I'm
doing this voiceover and I'm actually
sitting here with coffee and a limp
chocolate bunny basically stuffing my
face so if you actually saw me right now
you'd be like wow what a fatty but
anyways I'm going to get onto the video
so because these liquid lipsticks aren't
available in Australia obviously they're
only available in the targets or
drugstores of the u.s. so used a
shipping service called shop and box I
always get so many questions by you guys
asking what is shopping box how to use
it I'm so confused I'm trying to order
stuff basically shopping box is a
website that doesn't hold any inventory
or stock so they don't have like actual
products that you can just add to your
cart and buy so it's basically a service
where you're assigned a shopper and they
do all the shopping for you I'm going to
actually do a mini snapchat tutorial
when this video goes live and show you
step by step that's my dog step by step
on how to order and how to like place an
order do your wishlist submit your order
and the whole process so it's so much
easier for you guys to understand than
just listening to me ramble on I just
wanted to mention that that shopping box
does have a minimum international
shipping of 500 grams so for example one
of these liquid lipsticks only weighs 25
grams so that means you can buy an extra
20 at no extra shipping cost if that
makes any sense at all so I always get
asked if you can add more than one brand
to your wish list and the answer is of
course
can add as many brands as you want as
many products as you want literally they
will go out and get anything you want
for you this is literally the best
website I have discovered in my life so
I guess you guys are probably wondering
how much I paid to liquid lipsticks and
shipping so at the time that I ordered
the liquid lipsticks were $8 us each
which roughly converts to around $10
Australian but at the time CBS in the US
had true for one so I basically only
paid 69 US dollars for all twelve of
them which converted to around 90
Australian dollars so considering the
Kylie lip kits are like 50 Australian
dollars per liquid lipstick I'm pretty
sure $90 for twelve is such a bargain so
as for the shipping it's roughly
eighteen US dollars for the five hundred
gram three day express shipping so
basically when the items get to your
shop is half it only takes three days
for it to get to your house so I always
get asked how they actually work out how
much shipping is and everything like
that so I'm going to explain that to now
so basically after you create your
wishlist and you're assigned to a boxer
after they've confirmed everything and
they'll message you like through the
shop and box website like at the very
bottom you can chat with them like in a
little chat box which is really cool so
after all of your items are finalized
and confirmed with your shop art sheíll
message you and say can you please make
your payment for invoice one and it'll
say on your like when you log into your
account it'll say invoice one and
exactly how much you have to pay and
it'll have like a list of what you're
paying for basically so invoice one is a
total of all your items all together so
then after that your box art will either
order them online or buy them in store
and as soon as she does she will message
you and say I want invoice two now
because all of my items have arrived at
my house and I want to send them to you
so then you have to pay for invoice 2
which is just the shipping from her
house to your house which is as I said
before the minimum of 18 US dollars for
500 grams I really hope I'm making sense
because in my head it makes so much
sense but I know how easily this can
confuse you guys so if you have any
questions whatsoever
leave them in the comments below and
I'll try and answer them as thoroughly
as I can but I hope I'm making sense but
yeah anyways I thought I would get on to
like a me review of the actual formula
of the liquid lipsticks so basically I
would say four or five of the colors of
white patchy but once you go over them
with two layers they are fine for the
price they are amazing liquid lipsticks
they're obviously not the best you can
get like they're not personally my
favorite formula of liquid lipsticks but
for the price I really really enjoy them
and I really love the colors the first
two colors which is the lighter ones I
probably wouldn't wear on a day-to-day
basis because it's lighter than my skin
tone and I'm not really into the whole
lighter lips
I'm usually into the more darker nude so
yeah by the way the lasting powers of
these liquid lipsticks are really good
probably really comparable to the Kylie
ones I only had them on for about five
minutes or so I let them dry and then I
took a few photos with each of them on
and they were an absolute bitch to get
off just like the Kylie ones I had to
use makeup remover oil and all that so
for the price and the lasting power I
personally think that's good because in
a liquid lipstick what I look for the
most is lasting power because I don't
really want to be reapplying liquid
lipsticks on top of each other because
then they start to look drying and gross
so yeah by the way I will list all the
lip liners I used with each liquid
lipstick in the downbar below just
because I don't want it to be like messy
and confusing like having like lip
liners and the actual lip color on the
screen so I don't want to confuse you
guys but I'll have everything listed
down below so I think that's all I have
to say about shovin box and the liquid
lipsticks don't forget if you have a
question don't hesitate to leave it down
below I'll try and answer them all I'm
just going to let you guys watch the
rest of the swatches thank you guys so
much for watching don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and I guess I will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
