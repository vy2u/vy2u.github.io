so today's video is again in
collaboration with Rimmel London
Australia
I am trying out their new freshest skin
foundation and their royal cream blushes
which I am obsessed with I didn't even
set my face with a pressed powder that's
how much I loved how my skin looked I
just think this makeup look is really
fresh glowy
simple I'm just obsessed with how it
turned out so if you guys would like to
see how I created this look then just
keep on watching so first up I'm just
gonna spray my face with a facial mess
because it is so hot in here
oh my god it's probably about 30 degrees
outside not even joking I'm literally
already sweating and I haven't even
started my makeup so now I'm just going
to go in with a primer all over primer
is so important if you want your
foundation to stay on throughout the day
so I'm just going to evenly apply that
all over so as I mentioned earlier I am
teaming up with Rimmel London Australia
for this video introducing their new
freshest skin foundation which I am so
so excited to try I've actually never
owned a foundation in a little jar like
this how cute
oh that's also good so before I apply
the foundation I'm going to give you
guys a little bit more info about it so
apparently it is made for combination
skin types which is amazing because I
feel like these days foundations are
mainly for either dry or oily skin
I haven't actually come across a
foundation or a new foundation for
combination skins so that's a plus and
I'm pretty sure most people do have
combination skin whenever I ask my
clients what skin type they have because
I have two different primers one for
oily one for dry and most of them say
that either don't know or it's a bit of
both it's also a light to medium
coverage foundation so obviously if
you're looking for something with a
little bit more coverage then this is
not the foundation for you but Rimmel do
have really really good for
coverage foundations in their range as
well but this one in particular is for
light to medium so I'm going to see if
it's actually buildable because knowing
me I love my coverage so I'm going to
see if it does actually build up to a
nice medium coverage and I'm just not
much of like a light coverage girl even
though this foundation is made for that
I'm just going to see how I go with it
so the formula of this foundation
actually features natural mineral
powders which will help absorb excess
oil throughout the day
I hope that's true because I am oily so
hopefully this foundation works well on
my skin in saying that it does say that
it is sweat and humidity proof so
hopefully fingers crossed it is if this
works well on my skin that's going to be
absolutely perfect for summer so I'm so
so keen to try it the formula of the
foundation actually includes aloe
chamomile and sea algae extracts to
reduce redness in the skin it smells so
good like it just smells like a really
nice moisturizer I don't know my
moisturizer smells really good I don't
know about yours but it definitely
doesn't smell like a foundation also I
thought I would mention it comes in 8
different shades and it's retail price
is 1895 and it is available to buy it
right now so enough for the Rambla I'm
going to go ahead and try it out I think
I'm going to use the shade 303 true nude
I'm just going to unscrew the lid and
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to mix the foundation around just
because I would normally do that with a
bottle foundation so I'm just mixing
everything together I'm just going to
start by using a little bit I might just
do like a couple stripes along my face
it's going to go in with one of my baby
blenders and blend that in to my skin
so straight up it looks gorgeous on the
skin it literally just looks like a
fuller coverage tinted moisturizer I
definitely wouldn't say it's a light
coverage it's definitely more of a
medium coverage because it's covered
quite a bit of my redness on my face I
don't think I'm going to go ahead and
put another layer on because I'm quite
happy with how it's covered and how it
looks on my skin I really do hope that
it's coming across on camera like it is
in real life because my face just looks
really flawless so now to highlight my
face I'm just going to take a little bit
of concealer and just pop that
underneath my eyes I'm not going to go
too heavy on the concealing and
highlighting because it is supposed to
be a summer makeup look I love how I say
supposed to be I would laugh so hard if
this just turned into like a glare
makeup look it always happens every time
I sit down to do my makeup and I have in
my head yeah I'm just going to do
something natural Nek minnit
I'm wearing lashes like I'm so bad so
now I'm just going in with a little bit
of translucent powder just to set the
concealer otherwise it's going to crease
so now on to eyes I'm just going to do
it something really really basic and
easy so I'm just going to grab my
bronzer and I'm going to use that as my
transition color if you guys are
struggling to find the perfect
transition shade I can guarantee you
your bronzer would be perfect and for
the lid I'm just going to grab a
highlighter a powder highlighter sorry
and I'm just going to place that all
over the lid then taking a little bit
more bronzer and just sweeping that
underneath I'm just going to take a
little bit more of that highlighter and
it use that true highlight the inner
corners then I'm just going to go in
with a mascara and coating my top and
bottom lashes now back on to the face I
haven't even set my foundation and it
looks like it's settled really really
nicely into my skin it doesn't look
completely matte but doesn't look as
jewy as it did when I first applied it I
feel like I could almost get away with
not powdering it I'm actually not going
to set my face because I really really
like how it's seeped into my skin and
how it looks so I'm just going to go
ahead and bronze and just place that on
the cheeks
I'm taking that along my drawer as well
now on to it the royal cream blushes so
remor has just come out with three
different shades they are called coral
Queen regal rose and peach jewel that is
what they look like close up I think I'm
going to go ahead with coral Queen I'm
just going to apply it with my stippling
brush and just place that on the apples
of my cheeks these blushes are supposed
to be cream to powder formulas meaning
it goes on like a cream and dries as a
powder which is awesome it has a really
really nice glow to it as well I've used
cream blushes before but they've been so
like streaky and patchy but this one's
really really gorgeous in pressed so I'm
going to go ahead and highlight my face
I'm going to use a cream highlighter and
it use that on my cheekbones oh yes
Cupid's bow and then on the tip of my
nose and then a little bit on the bridge
and then I'm going to put some a little
bit above my eyebrow Phillips I'm just
going to go in with a nude lip liner and
then what I'm actually going to do is
I'm going to take the cream blush again
I'm going to use that and see if it kind
of works well as like a lip stain they
really like the color oh my god this
color though is life just going to go
over that with a gloss
and then that you finish off the look
I'm just going to spray it some setting
spray so this is the final look I really
really love how it turned out and I'm
honestly obsessed with how this
foundation is looking on my skin I hope
