so first up for primer I'm using the
model code face base and obviously just
applying that all over my face just with
my hands and then I go in with the
benefit Porefessional and just apply
that on both sides of my nose and on my
chin just because I find that these
areas of my face are the most textured
so I just like to even them out for a
more flawless application and then for
foundation I'm using one of my favorites
at the moment which is the Tarte
Amazonian clay this one's in the shade
tents and I've actually recently been
using this one in my kit and really
really loving it so I'm just applying
that all over my face with a damp Beauty
Blender then taking the Tarte shape type
concealer in the shade light/medium and
just using that underneath my eyes to
conceal and highlight then I go ahead to
place it on my chin Cupid's bow down the
bridge of my nose and then on my
forehead and then blending it all in
with a damp Beauty Blender as well
then going in with my fav translucent
powder the laura mercier one and i'm
just applying that directly underneath
the eyes to it bake the area then just
taking the mellow cosmetics brow pomade
and this one's in the shade brunette and
just using that to lightly fill in at my
brows so now taking some more concealer
I'm just using that on a concealer brush
and just using that to define the brows
I just like to go straight underneath
and straight above
then taking the astrologer Shand full of
face powder in the shade medium 10 and
just using that to set the rest of my
foundation just using a large powder
brush for this
then taking legit the most beautiful
hourglass palette I've ever seen in my
life I'm taking the bronzer shade out of
it and just using that to obviously
bronze up my face just on an angled
brush so just placing that on my cheeks
and then I go ahead to put it on my
forehead jawline and then on the sides
of my nose as well
then just to add a little bit more
warmth I'm going in with one of my
favorite bronzers the Too Faced
sweethearts one and just placing that in
the same areas
then taking the Kat Von D shade light
palette I'm taking the middle shade I'm
using that to contour I forgot how much
I love this I literally bought this like
a year ago and I've just I don't know
just put it in the back of my drawers
and forgot to use it but I literally
love it so much so I've recently started
using it again and then I'm just gonna
go in with the blush from that gorgeous
hourglass Holliday palette and just
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
then taking this new highlighting
palette from NYX it's called a stroke of
genius palette and oh my gosh I was so
surprised it is so so pigmented I love
love love love this palette and it's
drugstore so thank God I found a
affordable drugstore highlighter that I
can use in my tutorials then I'm just
taking some more of that concealer and
just using that to prime my eyelids and
of course setting them as well in place
just with some translucent powder so
important to set your eyelids just
because the eyeshadow will just blend
way way easier then taking the anasazi
Beverly Hills makeup by Mario palette
literally my favorite palette right now
and taking Isabel and just using that in
my crease and slash all over my eyelid
and yeah it's just a really really
pretty like burnt orange e-type
transition color and just using that on
a large fluffy brush then taking a
Violeta which I've hit pan on and oh my
god I was so upset that day I'm just
placing that on the same areas that I
applied the first color just to deepen
it up a little bit
then I'm also placing Violetta
on my lower lash line as well so now for
the fun bit I'm just taking the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
light on a concealer brush and this is
where I'm going to cut the crease so to
find your crease all you have to do is
open and then just literally start the
cut from a little bit above your natural
crease just so it gives the illusion of
a bigger crease I'm not the best at
explaining things but hopefully you can
see at what I'm doing
then I'm just taking a synthetic style
brush just to blend out the concealer
then I'm just taking a little bit more
of Violetta on a more tapered brush just
to define the crease a bit more then
taking Cypress number from the modern
renaissance palette also by anastasia
beverly hills and just kind of placing
that on the outer corners only and
blending it out and also placing that on
the lower lash line area as well
then taking the Urban Decay a liquid
liner in the shade distortion and
placing that all over my lid I love
using glitter liquid liners as opposed
to loose glitters because obviously
they're a lot cleaner and they feel a
little bit more comfortable on the
eyelid I'm not saying loose glitters
don't feel like uncomfortable but you
can definitely feel them on the eyelid
so if you're like one that has like
sensitive eyes or like is prone to like
creasing on the lid that I would 100%
recommend glitter liquid liners if you
want that glittery look so yeah then
taking the Rimmel scandaleyes liquid
liner and I'm just using that just to
line the top of the eyelid
then taking the Kylie cosmetics dark
bronze gel liner and I'm just using that
Ian at my waterline then just pop it on
some lashes i'm pretty sure i use the
billion lashes in the style cassie if
they're not I'll leave them listed down
below then taking so lip liner by Mac
and using that to line my lips then for
lipstick I'm using the Smashbox be a
legendary lipstick in the shade and I
was like obsessed with the color and the
formula of these are so nice as well
super creamy and pigmented and then for
gloss on top I'm just using a two-faced
lip injections gloss I'm pretty sure
this one's in the shade milkshake
so that's the final look I hope you guys
enjoyed watching I loved how it turned
out and I hope I give you guys a little
bit of inspire this year's New Year's
Eve doesn't even make sense anyways
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
