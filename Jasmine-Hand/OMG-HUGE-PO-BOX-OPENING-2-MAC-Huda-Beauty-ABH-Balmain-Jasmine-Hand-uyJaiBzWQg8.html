so if you guys didn't already know I've
been away for about three and a half
weeks I was in Perth so I came home to
all of these parcels for my pear box and
you guys seem to love my last pair box
opening so I thought I would film
another one so yeah I'm just gonna get
straight into opening them I've been
like holding off opening these for three
days now so I'm so excited to see what's
inside this one says Gemological on it
so that's obviously skin care all right
so I got their skin hydrating booster
their skin smoothing cream and daily at
my crib foliat I'm actually running on
my skin care and I'm keen to try this
out so thank you so much Dermalogica
this is actually something that I
ordered I just ordered some more of
these Scotties and makeup brush pen it's
what I use to spot clean my brushes and
a sell one
so these are the Scotties makeup studio
brush sterilizes they come in later
bottles and I just deposit it into a
small spray bottle and that's what I use
true spots in my brushes when I'm
working and they literally dry the brush
instantly so that's why I love it and
they're really choking this is like $25
so Scotties makeup and beauty just a
website they're australia's I brought
four of those excellent oh it's from
beauty blends on so it's just then you
 well that's like a camera there
oh I think this live hold on oh it's
turned on I don't know if you can see it
like flashing hold on May that's a
stencil that's so extra and just can
take a little Beauty Blender I actually
need the newbie Linda so thank you guys
so much I love you
as I always use them so that will come
in handy Oh porn star
I love falling star okay so oh my god
that's so nice
I just got a pair of earrings and the
tree of necklaces I don't know how well
you can see it so pretty thank you so
much alright next I'm flying through
them this time this one is by models
phone
alright so it's there cheat day
collection just comes with a
I shot a pellet highlighter palette and
then it's some lip products so if you
guys don't know model zone is a pretty
affordable brand here in Australia
it's from Priceline so yeah I'm keen to
play around with those ones Bed Head
shampoo conditioner and I think that's a
volume spray awesome I actually did need
some more shampoo a business that came
in handy thanks guys like a makeup face
oh my god oh my god this is so cute you
guys how cool is that inside this this
is so exciting
the coral obsessions and the gemstone
obsessions palette
oh my god I'm living for this palette
I'm never that aside and someone will
get with that for sure then I got their
liquid matte their meanings and their
life mainly nude colors which I'm super
excited for some of her lash glue I got
some lashes I got them in the style Jade
Samantha Farah and Giselle which are
pretty much like my favorite of all I
got some liquid to matte liquid
lipsticks I got the shades true I'm a
bombshell muse girlfriend I
entrance and I'm they're all pretty much
like nude colors and what I like wearing
off it's another one happy packaging
that's amazing
I do have her original one but
apparently the formula of this one is a
lot better so she reformulated the black
metallics in this palette so I'm just my
god I'm like obsessed with the first one
that's like not the prettiest felt you
ever seen your life then I don't know
what is you can definitely tell that the
metallics on this eyeshadow palette
looks a lot like more buttery and creamy
aware as the other ones were kind of
chunky and not gonna lie you couldn't
really apply it as a brush but once I
put them on with my finger I found that
it worked well but you can definitely
tell that these eyeshadows are more like
I don't know like there's more moisture
in the eyeshadows but I'll show what
they look like close up there's
definitely like a lot sturdier and like
it just feels better quality so I'm
super excited to try this one out I'll
put it aside and I film a tutorial with
it like next time I feel alright oh this
one's heavy I'm literally gonna take me
like at least five loads downstairs to
go and take all this that's why I
usually like to like both of my packages
like top of the piano box like in my
come on Walker then I can just put them
in the bin outside straight away L'Oreal
Paris ex of Bowl main powers am I even
saying that right where's a Balmain
literally do not trust me with
pronouncing designer because I
literally don't know it this looks
really really breezy that's how you're
gonna woo so it's just a bunch of
lipsticks and whatever lookin see that's
not how its
the colors oh wow that's like bright
purple okay
Oh blue you wouldn't say they'd be color
that I wear every day but I'm just I'm
living for the ball mag that's nice it's
like a dark brown and this one's like
the grey that's so interesting but cool
like what makeup brand just come up with
like freakin cobalt blue lipsticks just
casually I think this sides gonna be
more like nudie colors that's actually
really pretty that color oh that's
really pale probs of bitter epal for me
Wow coffee green that is insane and then
this one's it's like a grey that's
actually wearable I like that one oh
there's more so in the middle of the box
there is four more colors
okay the colors on the bottom it's like
a dark purple this one's like a Moroni
red that's really nice
it sounds pretty like a soft pink color
oh that's pretty
that is my kind of color I really like
that then a few more to go
this one I can already tell it's one BH
Cosmetics bold brilliant beautiful oh my
god that's amazing
they're marble rush sets
thanks guys I might have to take them to
this down because I need to replace
in the salon pile this new set is
perfect for you and your bestie oh cool
so it's just the BFF
Beautyblender so I guess I'm gonna have
to give one to be on the other side
what's this that's a t-shirt I think is
it oh oh oh
best friend t-shirts so I'm gonna have
to give one of those to Vic as well
that's such a cool idea thanks guys oh
all right so next one this one's from B
SD which from my memory like that's
that's like a supplement brands awesome
are they sending me supplements but I'm
not complaining like I do take some so

like protein bars so gave you the high
protein low carb protein bar this one is

have a few times it's not like a massive
package like it so i'm going to see
what's inside oh my oh my god what the
hell there's so much makeup in here I
have to show you guys close up oh my god
how pretty is it it looks way better in
real life but some reason I think the
colors I kind of a little bit washed out
because of the lighting but that is so
huge if I have the routier ooh lip liner
and lipstick I have these and I love it
oh we're going to build it Teddy this is
like my favorite this is like honestly
my go-to lip color at the moment I'm
obsessed with it and I was actually
running low on it so that is always a
bonus but I love this spray it's a fixed
plus gold light I actually have the pink
one here watching this right now right
shall we
oh my god I'm obsessed with the smell of
fix boss you can't really tell in the
camera but that is so pretty
umm strobe cream I haven't used this in
ages like I used to love using stroke
cream
don't focus on me because on this um
this one's the pinky along these the all
bad lash mascara I've never tried this
one before
that's what it looks like umm this is
the false lashes Maximizer mascara also
haven't tried this one this is a lip
product
reven prime ah so I'm guessing
you put this on before lipstick I'm not
actually trying to look come before so
I'm gonna put that up here and try that
next time and lastly I got one of their
lip scrubs I haven't used a lip scrub in
years that's so cute
that is super cute I actually tried it
up tonight haven't use a lip scrub in

heavy so I'm like we think you're going
to love your Beckham a case oh my god it
took it bad if it is a makeup bag I'm
gonna die place with all these companies
