channel getting straight into it again
I'm just going over our face with some
gummy and micel water just to ensure her
face is nice and clean then I'm going in
with the anastasia beverly hills program
palette and i'm taking the shade soft
brown and just lightly filling in her
brows
then I'm just taking a light concealer
and just using that to define above and
below the brows just with a concealer
brush then taking Benefit Cosmetics
gimme brow and just running that through
her brow just to give it a little bit
more fullness and just to set the brows
in place then I'm just priming the
eyelids they like concealer as well and
then setting them in place with some
translucent powder
so this book was actually inspired by
Tamina makeup on Instagram I loved her
work she always does heaps of bright
colorful bold looks so I decided to do
that today so I'm just grabbing these
two pinky shades I'll leave everything
that I use down below and I'm just using
that in her crease as the transition
color then I'm taking the anasazi
Beverly Hills modern renaissance palette
I'm taking at these two pinky shades and
just mainly focusing that on the outer
corners of the eyes and then bringing it
into the crease as well
then taking Cyprus on Bosch a dough
which is just a matte brown and also
focusing that on the outer corners of
the eyes as well then I was taking a
matte black eyeshadow and also placing
that in the outer corners just to it
make it really really smoky and intense
then I'm taking the still up magnificent
metal cream sort of eyeshadow in the
shade in certain and just placing that
in the inner corners of her eyes
Thunder taking a cotton tip with some
makeup remover and just sharpening up
the edges of the eyeshadow then it just
popping on some a mascara in preparation
for false lashes and just using a
disposable mascara wand I got these ones
from eBay that is silicon one but it's
fun that they work so much better than
just some normal ones and then I'm
taking the model rock to one two lashes
my favorites and just popping them on
then taking the Too Faced hangover
primer and just popping that all over
our face of course to prime her skin at
before foundation then I decided to pop
on some of the iconic illuminating drops
just because I wanted her face to look
as jewy as possible like in the photo
that I showed you earlier so I put that
on the highest point of her cheekbones
Cupid's bow and sort of her nose just
where you wouldn't normally like powder
highlight
then just spraying her face with some
fixed paths before foundation and the
foundation I use with Mac Studio Fix and
MC 16 I only used one pump all over
because I wanted her face to look as
sort of I don't know natural as possible
and Joey so yeah I just put one pump on
and spread that all over with a damp
Beauty Blender then I use some of the
back our liquid opal highlighter and
place that on her cheekbones Cupid's bow
chin and down the bridge of her nose
just where you would typically highlight
as well just to create that extra jewy
look then going in with a Maybelline fit
me concealer in light and just placing
the smallest amount just underneath her
eyes true color correct and blending
that all out
then I'm just taking some of the laura
mercier translucent powder and just
using that to set underneath her eyes
then taking the Becca shimmering skin
perfector in a pearl this highlighter is
amazing for pale girls and of course
just placing that in the same spot as we
placed the highlighter earlier so on the
cheekbones Cupid's bow tip of the nose
and then down the bridge as well then
going it with the artist palette by on
the star then taking this light blue
shade and just using that to smoke out
her lower lash line
then I'm going in with a black just on
the outer corners of the lower lashline
just to make it a little bit more
dramatic
then going in with haul-out light
bronzer and just using that to contour
her cheekbones or just placing that with
the brush that it came with just in the
hollows of her cheekbones
I just wanted to intensify that contour
a little bit more so I just went in with
a normal whole light and just placed it
in the same areas as well then going in
with the California blush by benefit
also and just placing that on the apples
of her cheeks and then for lips I went
in with the Marc Jacobs lip gloss in the
shade sugar sugar and just placing that
on her lips
and then just finishing off with some
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and that is the final look I hope you
