channel so for today's video I've teamed
up with Rimmel London Australia I've
created two looks for you guys so
basically they've come out with a new
campaign called the trend drop series so
every month they come out with a new
trend and if you can't already guess
this month's trend is peach glow so I've
created two different looks today
so the first look is more of an everyday
natural like peachy glowy look with no
lashes or anything and then the second
look I transformed into this which has
more bolder lips I put on some lashes
and I also added some glossy lips for
something a bit different
the aim of their campaign is to step out
of your comfort zone and create an edgy
a sort of look than what you're used to
so yeah if you'd like to see how I
created these two looks using a Rimmel
London's products and just keep them
watching so first up a primer I'm taking
the remote lasting finish primer and
just popping that all over my face
primer is so good for keeping your base
on for longer than usual if you want to
use one then I'm going in with the
breathable a lasting foundation one of
my favourite foundations at the moment I
use the shade 400 so I'm just using the
applicator to pop it on my face and then
just blending it all in with a damp
Beauty Blender
and then for that glow I'm going in with
the Rimmel insta strobing a liquid
illuminator and just popping that on the
highest points of my face so just on my
cheekbones Cupid's bow and down the
bridge of my nose then going in with
their breathable concealer in the shade
200 and just popping that underneath my
eyes to conceal and highlight that area
and then blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender and then to set the
concealer I'm taking the Rimmel match
perfection translucent powder and
popping that directly underneath my eyes
just to avoid any creasing throughout
the day then I'm taking the Rimmel at
Kate Moss blush palette and just taking
a mixture of those shades and popping
them on my cheeks for a flush of color
and just working that in true at these
sides of my temples as well then I'm
taking the Rimmel natural bronzer just
to add a little bit more warmth to the
face then I'm taking it that Kate Moss
blush palette again and I'm just using
my finger to take the top shade and I'm
just literally putting that all over my
eyelid and smoking that out then I'm
just taking that same shade and just
using that on my lower lashline Truitt's
smoke it out then taking the remote
London Kate Moss pal this one's in the
color coral glow and I'm taking the top
highlight color and just using that to
highlight my inner corners and oh my god
how bright is it I'm obsessed and then I
also went underneath my brow bone keep
its bow and bridge of my nose and
obviously used it on my cheekbones too
and I was seriously so blown away I love
love how pigmented it is then using the
Rimmel royal blush this one is the coral
Shea and I'm using that on my lips you
can pretty much use it anywhere eyelids
cheeks lips wherever you please cream
products are so versatile then taking
the Rimmel oh my gloss one of my
favorite clear glosses of all time and
just popping that straight over top then
finishing off with the Rimmel insta-fix
and go setting spray and spraying that
all over and that's the first look done
I just realized there's a super
appropriate for Valentine's Day that's
coming up if you're wanting something
subtle
Coralie and glowy so
there you have it and then I'm gonna go
in it to amp it up a bit so I'm taking
the magnified eye palette and using that
dark brown chocolate shade and just
mainly placing that on the outer corners
of the eyes just using a large fluffy
brush and yeah just blending away and
then I'm taking that same shade and
smoking it onto my lower lash line
then I'm taking the remote wonder wing
liquid Lida and just creating a little
wing
but I just popped on some fake lashes
and now on to lips I'm using this lip
liner
I'll leave the shade that I use down
below but I'm just using that to line my
lips and then I go ahead to fill in my
lips with it as well
then going over the top with their lip
art glosses they are so pretty I was so
shocked and then I'm gonna also use that
gloss on my eyelids for something a
little bit different so I'm just mainly
focusing that on the inner corners of my
lids and just kind of blending it into
the darker shade
I hope you guys enjoyed watching comment
