so first up I'm going in with the NYX
pore filler and I'm just using that
around the sides of my nose and on my
chin just on the textured areas of my
face then going in with the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue primer and
just using that on the rest of my face
then for brows going in with the
anastasia beverly hills medium brown
dip brow and just using that to it fill
in my brows
then I'm just taking a bit of concealer
and putting it above and below the brow
just to make it look a bit more defined
then taking the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shade sand and
obviously putting that all over my face
and then blending it all in with a damp
Beauty Blender
then taking the Urban Decay waitlist
concealer in the shade light/medium and
just using that to highlight my under
eye area then I go ahead to place it on
my Cupid's bow at chin and then bridge
of my nose and then a little bit on my
forehead and then of course blending it
out as well
then taking the Naz translucent powder
I'm just using that to bake underneath
my eyes actually really like this stuff
really comparable to the laura mercier
one pretty sure they're around the same
price I probably prefer the other one
but I thought I would switch things up
then to set the rest of my face i'm
using the Australis fresh and flawless
in the shade darkest brown of course
just to yeah set the rest of my face
then I'm taking a fashion addict by
makeup geek cosmetics and just using
that in my crease and pretty much all
over my eyelid as well and just smoking
that all out then I'm just taking more
pink and blending it out until I get
this color then I'm going in with this
purple from I'm pretty sure it was the
sweethearts palette by Too Faced and it
was so so hard to blend out as you can
see like I normally love Too Faced
eyeshadows but I have heard that purple
shades can be quite difficult to work
with so just letting you guys know I
probably wouldn't recommend that purple
from the palette and then I'm just
taking away the excess baggage from
underneath my eyes and then I'm just
grabbing that purple again and just
running it underneath my lower lash line
then I'm just taking some translucent
powder on an angled sponge and just
using that to sharpen up the eyeshadow
just instead of concealer just because
I've already powdered my face and it'd
probably turn out like a mess then I'm
just taking some black that was from the
urban decay Gwen Stefani palette and I'm
just placing that on the inner corners
of my eyes
then I'm taking the two-faced glitter
glue and the linker cap pink glitter I'm
not sure what the name is I got it sent
to me a couple months ago so I'll leave
everything I use down below anyways so
I'm just packing that glitter glue in
the inner corners and then I go ahead to
pack on the glitter straight on top
then I'm just wiping off the excess
powder how satisfying was that just to
watch
then I'm taking the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and just applying a
coat to my top and bottom lashes
so then I'm creating the skull like bone
structure so I'm just taking a black
matte eyeshadow and as you can see I'm
just creating a line a lot higher to
where you would usually contour and then
kind of like bending it down I'm so bad
at explaining things but you can see
what I'm doing if you see like a picture
of a sugar skull or a skull it should be
an easy kind of guide not gonna lie
though I did have to wipe it off like
three times before I got it right then
taking C the same pink eyeshadow and
just using that to blend the black
downwards and yet just keep on blending
then for the teeth I'm taking an angled
brush just with the same matte black
eyeshadow and just creating two straight
lines from either side of my mouth and
then for the teeth it's a lot easier
than you probably think so all you do
first is just create vertical lines
straight down so I'll probably speed
this bit up but I'm pretty sure you'll
learn more just by watching me than by
me trying to explain it
then to make the teeth actually look
like teeth what you're going to want to
do is just kind of create like a
teardrop type shape so kind of I don't
know it's really hard to explain but I'm
just kind of like making two lines from
the top and then curving every single
sharp edge so because it kind of looks
like boxy now every sharp sort of edge
you see you're gonna want to round it
off and that'll make the illusion of
like teeth so once again I'm just gonna
let you watch because I'm so bad at
explaining this kind of stuff
then just taking some pink eyeshadow and
just using that to shade around the
teeth I don't know why I did this but
yeah I did it so I'm just kind of like
using that to blend like the gaps
between the teeth together then taking
the next jumbo eye pencil in milk and as
you can see just filling in the teeth I
then decide to go in with like a lip
brush just for more precision I'm gonna
speed this up because it took me about
three years
then to highlight I'm taking the artists
Couture glow powder in the shade Yas and
just using that to highlight my
cheekbones and the top of my lip and the
tip of my nose
then taking anastasi Beverly Hills
catnip liquid lipstick and I'm just
gonna create the little Scully nose so
yeah as you can see just creating the
nose and then I do two little spikes at
the top
then taking some artists Couture
highlighter again and just popping it on
my nose then taking the Egyptian queen
Beauty lashes I forgot the style I'll
leave it down below and popping them on
my eyes and then using the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk to line my waterline and
then I kind of felt like I needed the
teeth to look more defined I'm just
taking a felt tip liner and just kind of
going over some of the lines
so this is the final look I hope you
