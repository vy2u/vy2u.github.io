so in today's video I have done the
gorgeous makeup by Michael Finch's face
so if you would like to see how I
created this what are we calling it is
stunning
rose gold pinky glittery so ready I then
just keep on watching hey guys so first
up I'm going in with a primer by the way
all the products that I used in this
video are Michaels and so a brushes so
I'm not 100% sure what brushes I use but
I'll try my best to list everything down
below so I'm going in with the Too Faced
hangover primer and just using that to
prime his face then going in with a bit
of fix+ spray as always and then for
foundation before you guys say that it's
not his color well we didn't actually
have a pale foundation that would suit
his skin tone so we just blended it down
his neck so it all matched up in the end
so it did actually look good it was just
a little bit true kind of like yellowy
base but we worked with it because we
obviously didn't have anything else
see what I mean how it just like matches
his neck but meanwhile we're freakin
blending it halfway down his body oh
well and then until I'm taking the
mac prolongwear in the shade nc15 I am
actually really liking this concealer I
have it at home but I never use it but
ever since I use it on Michael I'm going
to use it a lot more in my kid it's
really full-coverage and I just like the
consistency it doesn't like crack or go
cakey so yeah I'm really liking it so
I'm just placing it underneath these
eyes Cupid's bow chin forehead and down
the bridge of his nose then to bake I'm
taking the RCM a translucent powder and
just using that underneath the eyes just
to ensure that the concealer will not
crease it's actually really good and
then I'm taking my favored Stralis fresh
and flawless this was in the shade deep
natural I probably should have used
natural but again we were working with
limited products and he didn't have it
but yeah I'm just using that to set the
rest of his foundation for brows I'm
using the benefit browsing he was so
nervous when I was doing his brows for
some reason I guess like everyone has
like their own way of doing brows but
I'm just like kind of lightly filling
them in not really creating a shape just
going over like the natural hairs I
think it looks really cool and soft and
different for him so I'm just doing that
then I'm just going in with a bit of
concealer underneath the brows just to
tidy them up
then taking the Anastasi Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette I'm taking a
red ochre and just using that to buff in
his crease because I'm just using that
as a transition color first
then taking Cypress umba from the pallet
it's just a dark brown I'm just using
that on the outer corners of the eyes
and then blending it out and then for
the lid I use a glitter injections press
glitter this one's just in a pink I'm
not sure what color it is sorry and I'm
just placing that on the inner corners
of the eyes
then going in with the Inglot 77 line up
just on the best eyeliner brush i've
ever used thanks to Michael I think it's
like the zoeva definer brush but I'm
going to get it like literally after I
filmed this voiceover it's so good I'm
just creating a wing I went for a little
bit more of a dramatic wing just because
I always see him do dramatic wings and
he suits it so much so yeah I'm just
getting him to open his eyes first
mapping out the wing and then filling it
in
then going in with the two-faced
sweetheart
bronzer and the haul up by benefit
bronzer and just using that true contour
and bronze up his face
then going in with the RCM a no color
powder again I'm just using that on the
Beautyblender to bake underneath his
contour then I'm attempting to contour
his nose I know I'm not as good at it
than he is but I'm just going and
putting the transition powder on either
side of his nose I've seen this on
Instagram all the time and I've never
actually tried it for myself so there's
the first time for everything then going
in with a makeup geek blush and I'm just
placing that on the apples of his cheeks
I'm not sure what color it is though
I'll have to ask him and I'll leave it
in the description for you guys
then for highlighter I'm taking the UH
Nastasia ultimate glow kit not going to
lie I'm not like that like I don't know
obsessed with it like the colors are
really nice I use them as eyeshadows
more than highlighters the consistency
of like the actual colors are really
grainy like they're really similar to
the Jeffrey style ones so I always use a
jeffree star ones as like an inner
corner highlight or even like eyeshadow
but I just don't know about these as
highlighters but still a really stunning
palette just thought I would put it out
there then I'm just brushing off the
excess powder from the bacon underneath
his contour and then I wanted to contour
a little bit more cuz you know why not
stana using some more of that red ochre
eyeshadow and just using that to it
smoke out his lower lashline then taking
the best highlighter I've ever used in
my life like literally the over our
Beverly Hills one I need to get this as
well and just using that to highlight
his inner corners and then I'm going in
with the mascara I'm going in with this
Mac one and I'm just using that to coat
his top and bottom lashes it was
actually his so obviously I'm just using
it straight from the wand then going in
with the fearless lashes by Iris Beauty
these are stunning he actually tried to
put these on me but because like they
were so long Lee touched by brows they
just did not suit me
then going in with the new anastacio
liquid lipstick in the shade on and yeah
just putting that on his big ass lips
so this is the finished look I hope you
