so in today's video I decided to do a
Q&amp;amp;A because I haven't done one on my
channel in about six months so I asked
you guys to send in some questions on my
Instagram photos so I'm just gonna go
ahead and start reading the questions so
the first question comes from Emily
built under school and she asked what's
my favorite place to buy clothes I'm not
really much of a shopper like I don't
really online shop or go shopping for
clothes much because let's be real I'd
rather spend my money on makeup but I
would have to say one of my favorite
stores probably Alli just because it's
so cheap there's always so much clothes
in there to choose from and yeah I just
find myself always in that store when I
go shopping so Miss Emily guitar asks
when did you realize you wanted to
become a makeup artist and who inspires
me I honestly have no idea when I was
just at that point where I was like yep
I want to be a makeup artist I kind of
started my freelancing business about
two and a half years ago and I was doing
my friends and their friends friends
makeup for free just to practice and I
really really really enjoyed it so I
started charging about twenty dollars
and oh my god my work back then was
horrible but everyone start somewhere
practice does make perfect obviously
like when I first started I absolutely
had no idea what I was doing I think it
kind of just sprung from there I kind of
practice and practice and practice and
got better so yeah Here I am today and
makeup artistry is my full-time job so
yeah I love it so the next question
comes from Courtney shorter and she
asked what's the best site to buy lashes
in bulk
hands down model rock lashes especially
if you're a makeup artist and you're
looking to buy like cheap lashes you can
buy the 50 bolt pack for $99 I'm pretty
sure so that comes down to like a dollar
eighty per like pair of lashes and
there's I think around ten styles to
choose from in the bulk section so yeah
I would definitely have to say model
rock lashes so Julia exits
what age did you start to wear makeup I
don't really recall wearing makeup much
in high school except for I think
towards the end of grade 12
but we have to say 17 years old but I
did start to like experiment and wear
makeup younger but I never actually put
makeup on to go out of the house I would
just always muck around with like mums
makeup makeup that I've bought but yeah
when I started wearing makeup properly
like going out out probably 17 so bye
bye gal asked what's your favorite thing
or things to spend money on besides
makeup Lowell let's be honest probably
90% of everyone's paycheck goes towards
food like literally I've probably spent
over ten thousand dollars of food in my
life
like I'm not even joking it would
definitely have to be food andraia
kiraku i hope i pronounced that right
she asked what's your favorite makeup
item let me just get it
hands-down dead-set I could not live
without this contour such bronzer like
honestly write or die write or die right
here X Oh a beer a ass what's your
favorite foundation for flawless skin I
really really really love Mac Studio Fix
I also really love Estee Lauder Double
Wear I don't use it as much anymore
because my skin has cleared up so I
don't really feel the need to wear such
a high coverage foundation but if I had
to choose Mac Studio Fix hands down
it always looks flawless on me and my
clients so yeah
Mac Studio Fix aundrea Kuryakin says
shoot marry or shag Justin Bieber Zac
Efron at Channing Tatum okay well I'm
marrying Justin Bieber because I'm
obsessed with him probably killed
Channing Tatum because he's getting a
bit old and shagged Zac Efron okay ch ex
ah lip ask if you have the chance to
live in another country what country
would that be either Croatia which is
where I'm from or New York City because
I know I just get so happy when I see
photos from New York I just think it
would be amazing to live there so yeah
Croatia or New York
so Taylor pasal wait up if you had the
chance to collab with any makeup brand
to make any product what brand would it
be and what product would you make that
isn't
excellent question although I've always
always wanted to collab with the company
for eyelashes / make my own eyelashes
one day so hopefully hopefully that
happens if I was to make a style of lash
it would probably be House of lashes
because I love their style of lashes
makeup products either Too Faced or
either star seed Beverly Hills and I'll
probably make an eyeshadow palette yeah
an eyeshadow palette with Anasazi
Beverly Hills or Too Faced that would be
amazing
Danny Laurie asked if you'd only live
with one type of makeup what would it be
I think she means brand I think I've
answered this before but I would have to
say Mac just because I love their
foundation
I could go with their concealer savings
powders I don't like as much but I could
live with it I like them Ascari's
lipsticks blushes and contours so I
probably would have to say Mac and
jarate as how do you get your eyebrows
done threading waxing and what do you
recommend so I do have my eyebrows
cosmetically tattooed but every few
months I do get a bit lazy with plucking
them and maintaining them so I get them
threaded I would 100% recommend
threading because it gives such a crisp
line rather than waxing and I kind of
think threading hurts less than waxing
so I would definitely recommend
threading a me underscore Marie I just
got asked what's your favorite boost
juice definitely Mango Tango YUM
actually feel like one of them now why
would you have to ask that question
Emily with like three 40s ask what's
your favorite TV shows okay so I'm
literally obsessed with X on the beach
oh my god it is the funniest show i
watch with alex every wednesday and we
absolutely ourselves watching it is
so funny I also love Geordie Shore what
else the valley except that's stopped
and I hope that starts up again because
that is one hilarious show what else do
I like
I like reality TV select Big Brother and
stuff I don't really watch any like TV
series I used to watch pretty little
eyes that started getting boring real
quick I'm either one that's also an MTV
hilarious show it's
please show where people are
psychologically if that's even the word
like matched they'll have to go in they
basically all each other to find
their perfect match people fall for
their not match and it's just it is
hilarious I went down below if you also
watch those TV shows cuz they are
freaking gold and love reality TV yes
best question SR nails
asked what's your McDonald's order I'd
probably either get 10 nuggets
in a meal or the met chicken burger meal
with another frozen coke or a coffee
frappe oh now I feel like a frozen coke
what have you done to me
Kili kiosk II asked what you did you
study through what is your degree and
what do you want to do with it so I
studied through CTU Uni which is central
Queensland University which is based in
Rockhampton I moved over there with my
ex-boyfriend straight out of school
lived there for one and a half years
basically broke up and then move back
and then just do it online through
distance education so I finished that
not long ago and I have no idea what I
want to do with it I honestly have no
idea if I even want to do nursing at
this stage I don't know I just feel like
I've got my mind set on makeup and I
really want to see where that takes me
in life but if I wanted to be a nurse I
would definitely want to do cosmetic
nursing or something in the theatre so I
think that's enough questions for
today's video thank you guys so much for
asking questions I will make sure to do
q and A's every couple of weeks because
I guess I like really fun to film really
laid-back and chill yeah if you enjoyed
