so first up I'm going in with the
Garnier micellar water just on a cotton
pad just to ensure the face is nice and
clean before priming for primer I'm
using the benefit Porefessional matte
rescue primer just because as she said
she gets a little bit oily down her
t-zone then I'm just spraying her face
with a bit of Mac prep and prime fix +
spray the foundation we're using the new
Urban Decay all nighter in the shade v
to match her fake tan I love this
foundation it's got amazing coverage but
the other thing I don't like about it is
that it oxidizes so it could be super
confusing if you're wanting to get it so
as you can see it looks like an ivory
foundation when I first put it on but
once it's all blended in it blends into
her tanned skin color so just be mindful
of that if you're wanting to buy it
maybe buy like a shade or two lighter
when you swatch it on your hand like
when you're in store because then it
obviously oxidizes into like your color
so super weird but I really do love this
foundation so I'm just blending it all
in with a damp Beauty Blender
you
then taking my fav concealer ever the
Maybelline fit me in the shade 10 and
I'm just using that underneath her eyes
to conceal and highlight
then taking the laura mercier
translucent powder and I'm just using
that on that same damp bead blender and
just using that to bake her under eyes
which will prevent the concealer from
creasing
then taken the best pressed powder
ever the Australis fresh and flawless
and the shade medium tan and just using
that to set the rest of her face
then just popping some more of that
Maybelline fit me concealer on her
eyelids as a primer and then just
blending it all in then I'm just going
in with more of the Laura Mercier
translucent powder just to set the base
then I'm just brushing off the excess
powder from the under eye baked as well
for brows I'm going in with the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow palette
and I'm taking the shade soft Brown and
just using that to fill in her brows by
the way just thought I'd let you guys
know that a she also has a YouTube
channel so she uploads like Fitness food
videos she uploads her raw episodes on
their hair and makeup tutorials I've
actually done a video with her on there
so if you want to go check that out I'll
leave a link down below to where you can
find it so next up I'm going in with the
concealer and I'm just using that to
define her brows
then to set the brows in place I'm just
using a clear brow gel I'm unsure of
which one this one is but I'll leave it
listed down below for you guys then
taking hoola by benefit bronzer and I'm
just using that to contour and bronze
her face
then going in with the bomb hot mama
blush and just using that on the apples
of her cheeks then going in with the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills ultimate glow kit
oh my god
I died when I got this I'm using the
shade white sand on her cheekbones and
then I go to put it on the Cupid's bow
and the tip of her nose the formula of
these are quite different to her
original glow kits they're not as
buttery and smooth they feel like not
foiled but they're kind of grainy but
they're still really pigmented I don't
know why it didn't really show up in
this clip but then I show you in the
next clip when she turns to the side how
amazing the highlighter actually is
ready now now now so yeah they actually
are really nice but yeah the formula is
different for those that are wondering
then going in with your makeup by Mario
palette I'm taking the shade Isabelle
and using that in her crease for a
transition shade
you
then taking the shade violetta and using
that to basically put all over the lid
and I'm going to be blending it out into
the transition color so it's kind of
like a blown-out really soft brown
smokey eye
then taking a mixture of Isabel and
Violeta and just using that in the lower
lashline area and then taking Hollywood
and using that to highlight her in a
corner area this is literally the most
amazing white gold color ever then I'm
coating her lashes with a bit of mascara
and we decided to go with individual
lashes I'm not much of an expert on it
but Ashley says she always wears them
and I actually really liked how they
turned out it took me ages so that's why
I just skip to the lips I'm using the
Gerard cosmetics buttercup a lipstick
and just applying that all over
then it just applying some mascara onto
her lower lashes and then finally
spraying with the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and that is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed

subscribe and head over to Ashley's
channel for more videos and I will see
you in my next one
