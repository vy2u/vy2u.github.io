hey guys and welcome back to my channel
getting straight into it as always and
just taking the benefit Porefessional
and just using that around her nose and
textured areas of the face and then
going in with the Too Faced hangover
primer all over the rest of our face
then to add a little bit of glow I'm
going in with the iconic these are just
like illuminating drops and I'm just
placing that all over the face as well
just underneath the foundation and then
the foundation I use with the tight
Amazonian clay in the shade pants and
and distorting that on our face first
and then blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade light after think
about a per second first thought I use a
tight one and just place my underneath
her eyes and then I go ahead to post it
on her forehead bridge of her nose
Cupid's bow and a bit on her chin as
well and then blending it out with a
damp Beauty Blender - then taking the
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just using that to bake underneath her
eyes then taking the matte I think this
is yeah mineralized skinfinish in medium
tan and just using that to set the rest
of her face
now I'm just popping the eyelids just
using that same concealer and blending
it out and then I go into eyebrows and
taking the under stars II Beverly Hills
Pro brow powder and I'm taking at the
shade soft brown and just using that to
fill in her brows
and taking the same concealer as the
fore-end just using that to define the
brows it's with a concealer brush
then I'm just wiping away the excess
powder from underneath our eyes from the
bake and then onto eyes I'm using the
Too Faced one of the holiday edition of
palettes so first up I'm going in with
tiramisu which was just in the middle
row on the left it's kind of looks like
creme brulee it's a really pretty
transition color and just buffing that
into the crease then going in with this
shade from makeup geek I can't remember
it from the top of my head but I'll
definitely leave it listed down below
it's like a really deep purple it's so
it's so pretty and I'm just basically
working that on the outer edges and
slowly building up the color
then just taking an angled wedge with
some translucent powder and just
cleaning up the eyeshadow and then
taking this shade out of the same
palette and just using that to highlight
her inner corners and brow bone and
under taking that same purpley shade
that I will list down below I can't
remember it and just using that on her
lower lash line then I just take a
really like narrow brush and really work
that into the lower lash line and then
blend it out with a larger fluffier
brush
she actually had eyelash extensions on
so what I just did was drenched the
disposable mascara on with just a little
bit of water and just removed any of the
excess powder that may have dropped off
on the lashes but I did add mascara on
the bottom so there's absolutely no
mascara on the eyelashes extensions just
because I didn't want to ruin them
obviously and some people do like don't
mind if I do but she didn't want me to
so that's fine
and then I'm using the Too Faced
sweetheart bronzer to bronze up her face
I didn't really want to heavily contour
I wanted it more of like a bronzy glowy
sort of complexion so yeah I'm just
placing that on her cheekbone area
around her forehead jawline and down the
sides of the nose
and then just to add a little bit of
definition in the cheeks I baked
underneath her cheekbone so just used
the Laura Mercier translucent powder
stencil blush and taking the Too Faced
sweet peach blush it's a new one it's so
it's so pretty it's pretty much like a
highlighter and a blush in one as you
can see it's super glowy I love it and
then the highlighter I use is also from
the new sweet peach collection and it is
like a peachy sort of toned highlighter
which I loved I loved it so just
applying that on her cheekbones and
Cupid's bow and then on the tip of her
nose as well
solar plant I use the dried cosmetics
nude and I need a autumn more because
this is running so low and it's so hard
to line someone's lips when the pencil
for small anyways and then for lips I
used the Anastasia Beverly Hills lip
palette actually and I use the coral
shade from that so pretty and then I
just topped it off with a gloss and then
just set I just use the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and this is the
final look done I hope you guys enjoyed
