I
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
I know you're probably thinking whoa
with 35 minutes long what the are
you doing well I actually read some of
your comments on my previous client
tutorial because when I mentioned that I
can do a face in under 45 minutes or
whatever someone commented saying that
would actually love to see a whole
client tutorial in real time and I
thought that was pretty interesting so I
thought I would do that in today's video
so because this look was quite basic and
neutral I didn't use any liner on the
top of the bottom didn't really do
anything drastic on the eyes either it
took me thirty five minutes and this is
what it usually takes me on a normal
client as well for something more
dramatic with like liner at the top and
the bottom probably takes me around 45
minutes so because I won't be talking in
the majority of the video I'll still
explain what products I'm using and what
I'm doing so first up what I always do
is grab some Garnier micellar water just
on a cotton pad and just put that all
over a face just to ensure the face is
clean before priming because Rosie said
that she has slightly oily skin I'm
using the benefit Porefessional matte I
think it's like the matte rescue primer
it's the newer one I love it for oily
skin I use it on myself as well it's
definitely a must-have in your kit
also feel free to go grab a snack maybe
mute this video and put your own music
on just because I have to use non
copyrighted music so if it gets a bit
boring and repetitive then I definitely
understand that but I'll definitely be
explaining what I'm doing per step so
maybe when you see me do something new
then unmute it but otherwise I if I was
you I would probably mute it because I
get so sick of listening to all these
non copyrighted music songs so yes so I
allow 45 minutes per appointment so when
the client comes in I straightaway ask
if I am allowed to take before it after
photos 99.9% of them say yes sure and
there's like the odd person that
obviously doesn't want their before
photo online and I completely understand
that because I wouldn't want mine online
even though I do but if I was a client I
probably be like oh no thanks but yeah
so I do that first and then I sit them
down straightaway and start off with the
prepping of the skin so the guy named
Marcella bought it and the primer
obviously I asked the client what skin
type they have whether they have dry
oily combination if they get oily down
the t-zone or specific areas and
obviously I use the appropriate Primark
for that I feel like I'm speaking so
fast the foundation I used here was the
Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC 37 and as
always I'm a buffing that all in to our
face with a damp Beauty Blender you saw
me earlier using a buffing brush it was
just like a kabuki brush I'm pretty sure
it was by makeup addictions cosmetics I
just feel so awkward
buffing foundation into someone else's
skin because I feel like you really need
to put pressure in to really absorb the
foundation into the skin rather than
just sitting on top and I feel like
Abbey blender is much gentler for that
so that's why I use Beauty blenders on
clients I also use B blenders on myself
but I just find myself being a little
bit more rough when I use kabuki brushes
on other people but that's just my
personal preference that's why I like
using Beauty blenders so I've actually
had heaps of questions asking why door
use kabuki brushes and that is why
you
you
repeat this bittersweet he is
suffocating and always hesitating I
honestly don't even know what took me so
long just then to do the concealer but
for concealer of course I'm using the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
light and just using a makeup addictions
cosmetics concealer brush and I'm just
placing that underneath her eyes blend
it out and then I go ahead and place it
on a forehead bridge of her nose Cupid's
bow and the chin
with crimson secrets
kind of course baking her concealer with
the laura mercier translucent powder
just on that same at Beauty Blender
intoxicating
then going in and setting the rest of
her face with the trusty Australis fresh
and flawless powder in the shade darkest
Brown
you
then taking hoola by benefit bronzer
just on my mac 135 brush and just using
that to bronze her cheeks up
by the way if you see like random little
like splits of the footage it's just
because my camera stops recording after
a certain amount of minutes oh yeah I'm
going to have to like keep like starting
and stopping so that is why that keeps
happening
then for blush I'm taking the bomb hot
mama and just placing that on her cheeks
with a zoeva blush brush
then for highlighter I'm using my
favorite at the moment which is Emacs
soft and gentle and I'm using that with
a Anastasia Beverly Hills arm
highlighting brush
then taking some more of the Maybelline
fit me concealer in light to use as a
eyelid primer and then I go ahead to set
it just with a translucent powder
so then I'm going in with brows i'm just
using the anasazi beverly hills pro brow
palette and i'm taking the shade how or
tall I never know how to pronounce it
and then I'm just using that on a pretty
Cosmetics eyebrow brush because her
eyebrows already cosmetically tattooed I
didn't really need to do much to them I
just kind of went over them because of
the powder that had got into them from
when I was setting the face so yeah
dan was taking the same concealer as
before the Maybelline fit me and I'm
just using that to carve out her brows
then taking creme brulee by makeup geek
my absolute favorite transition shade
ever I use it on pretty much all of my
clients so I'm just running that through
her crease as a transition shade
so now I'm taking a little bit of cocoa
bear also by makeup geek and I'm also
running that in the crease as well just
to deepen up a bit and I really love
like the oranjee brownie tones like
above and in the crease so that's what I
did by the way the brush I'm using is
just a crease brush by makeup addictions
cosmetics
so that I'm taking the Urban Decay
cosmetics single eyeshadow in half-baked
I'm fairly sure that this is in one of
the naked palettes as well but I just
have the individual gold shade it's my
favorite ever gold shade ever and I am
hitting pan so hard as you can see so I
definitely think to buy a backup of this
and just using this on like a flat
concealer brush it's kind of like
synthetic I think this one's by Talia
Jada I think she has these brushes
anymore but Sigma has one pretty much
identical and as you can see I'm just
placing that mainly on the inner corner
through her lid
you
then I've decided to add a little bit of
glitter over top I think I'm just using
the Lime Crime Line I'll leave the color
down below as I'm not a hundred percent
certain but all I did was just spray my
brush with a bit of fix pass I didn't
use any like glitter adhesive or
anything just because I think fix+ works
well as well and yeah I just placed that
mainly on the inner corners of her eyes
so now I'm taking fudge single eyeshadow
by anastasi Beverly Hills just on that
same crease brush I'm just basically
placing that on the outer corners and
then bringing it up to her crease
you
you
so if you want to
you
then taking fudge again on a tapered
sort of brush once by zoeva I'll leave a
list down below of all the brushes are
used in order so as you can see I'm just
placing that on her lower lashline I
didn't want to put anything dark in her
waterline just because she said she
doesn't really suit that she never
usually wears like heavy eye makeup
anyway so I thought I'd do something
really nice light and natural-looking
then I'm taking the max soft and gentle
highlighter again and just placing that
in the inner corners of her eyes and
then on her brow bone and then I like to
intensify the Cupid's bow and the tip of
the nose
you
now I'm just coating her top and bottom
lashes with the benefit roller lash
mascara obviously on a disposable
mascara wand
you
the lashes I use the model rock lashes
in the style two three six and I use the
duo lash glue as well
then I'm just blending her false lashes
with her real lashes just with that same
mascara wand
you
and to line her lips I'm using the
Giraud cosmetics lip liner and then over
the top I'm using faux lipstick by Mac
you
you
you
so usually when I finish I just like to
go over things that I think needs a
little bit more of and yeah so I just
put a bit more bronzer on and then I go
ahead and put a little bit more
highlighter on because let's be real
who doesn't like more highlighter
you
