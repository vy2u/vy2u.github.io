channel so in today's video I'll be
doing the Jaclyn hill ride-or-die makeup
tag for those of you that don't know or
I haven't seen her video basically she
made up a makeup tag where she told us
all of her favorite products from each
category so for example her favorite
foundation primer mascara concealer
everything so these will be my absolute
favorite ride-or-die cannot live without
makeup products so if you would like to
see my rate or diet and makeup products
of all time then keep on watching a
first up primer my absolute favorite
hands-down is the benefit Porefessional
matte rescue primer if you have oily
skin you need this in your life it
literally just makes my face so matte
especially done my t-zone whenever I
wear it I never get oily too seriously
so amazing I highly would recommend it
if you have oily skin like myself next
up foundation now this was so hard for
me to choose just because I have like
five or six foundations that I use on
rotation and I don't like I've never had
a favorite foundation when people asked
me what my favorite foundation is I can
never answer it because I don't just
have one favorite but for the purpose of
this video if I had to choose one it
would probably have to be the Too Faced
Born This Way only just recently started
using this about maybe four or five
months ago I love love love the coverage
I love the color it doesn't go oily on
me sometimes it does go oily around my
nostrils that's normal for me like I
usually get like built up around my
nostrils and I can't really help that
but out of all the foundations that I
use I would have to say the Too Faced
Born This Way is my fave next up
concealer if you watch my videos and
you're probably just going to be like I
know what this bitch is going to say
because she mentions it literally 24/7
but I'm going to mention it again
it is the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade light I've tried all the other
high-end concealers I've tried the NARS
one Urban Decay one actually I do really
like that one I've tried the Mac one
I've tried tight I've tried them all but
this one has just been my favorite since
I started using it probably about maybe
two years now I've been using this I
just haven't been able to put it down I
always reach for it I use it on my class
and it's got the best coverage I love
the colors it's just literally so
amazing it's upsetting powder I
absolutely love the Laura Mercier
translucent powder although I have
recently discovered the RCM a1 and not
going to lie I really really really
really like that one but I didn't think
it would be fair on Laura if I mentioned
the other one even though I've been
using that one for about two weeks now
but because I've been using this for so
long and I always recommend it to
everyone it is seriously the most
amazing translucent powder especially
for baking underneath your eyes it
doesn't have any flashback which is good
I always get asked by people if this
does no no flashback but I know which
one has flashback the Australis
one that is literally the worst
translucent powder I've ever used in my
life don't buy it don't button next up
favorite setting powder again if you
watch my videos you probably know what
I'm about to say but I absolutely adore
the Australia's fresh and flawless face
powder the only thing I hate about this
product is that they don't have enough
colours like they only have about five
shades the lighter shade isn't even that
light in the darkest shade I use when
I'm tan someone with a darker skin tone
to me when I'm tan would not be able to
use these powders I just wish they made
more like they surely have to so
strollers if you're watching this please
make more colors and don't you dare ever
think about discontinuing this because I
would actually kill myself that was a
bit extreme but like you know what I
mean I'm obsessed with this powder I
love the coverage it doesn't have any
flashback it lasts all day so cheap I
love everything about it it's amazing
next up favorite bronzer again if you
watch my videos all the time this isn't
going to be a surprise to you it is the
benefit hoola bronzer I adore this I
think this is my favorite ever makeup
product even better than the fit me like
if I had to choose one this would be it
I literally can't do my makeup without
it I have actually recently tried the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and
then the sweethearts one and I really
really like those ones as well so I've
been mixing it up a bit
but I'll always go back to this one
because it's just the most perfect color
for contouring and it also comes a
little contouring brush which
makes your life ten times easier I
probably converted like 15 friends to
buy this like that's how it is you need
it if you don't have it get it
next up favorite blush I'm not much of a
blush wearer
I haven't really been into blush I'm
more of like a bronzer gal but if I had
to choose one it would have to be the
Milani baked blush in Luminoso I've just
hit pan recently I love it because it's
super glowy and it's not very pigmented
I would prefer like glowy cheeks then
like colored cheeks my clients say I'm
so weird because when I do clients
makeup I put a little bit of blush on
and I'm like are you a blush person do
you like blush and probably 90% of them
like yup pack on the blush I'm just like
oh my god I hate lush so much but
obviously I'm going to do what the
client says but I always go in with like
minimum blush first and then build it up
if the client wants more blush because
personally I would rather just bronzer
and highlighter I don't know is that is
that weird that I don't like blush but
oh well this one's my favorite if I had
to choose one next up brows now I don't
just use one specific brow product just
because I have so many to choose from I
just use something different every time
but if I had to choose one it would have
to be the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow ever since i've gotten my brows
her dude I haven't been needing to fill
them in as much all I do is I sometimes
just get some of this or even some
powder run through the sparse areas and
then just clean it up with concealer and
then brow gel and that's it that's all I
do to my brows now which is awesome I
literally don't really have that much
product on my brows at the moment so but
if I had to choose one a brow product
that I really love it would be the dip
brow next up line up my absolute
favorite it has been for a very long
time is the Tarte clay paint liner in
black I was going to choose the
maybelline eye studio but I don't use
that eyeliner for the top I only use
that for the waterline so I guess my
favorite water life eyeliner would be
the Maybelline eye studio but from the
top liner to do my wings it would have
to be the Tarte clay paint it goes on so
smoothly I like the consistency of it
it's not thick it's quite runny but it
dries really matte and it does not
transfer at all which is why I love it
so yeah that's my favorite line
I thought I would mention my favorite
contouring palette I don't use this as
much but I feel like it is a category
like contouring has become so big
recently that it's it's like it's a
category so I would have to say my
favorite is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
powder contour kit looks like this I
love this banana shade I use it when I'm
wearing like minimal makeup just to set
my under eye area when I don't want to
bake and I love these two shades for
contouring as I said I don't use it as
much because I just used my hauler all
the time but if I had to choose one that
I love it would be this one next up
favorite eyeshadow palette this was
seriously the hardest decision out of
everything just because I have my own
custom Z palette with anastacio and
makeup geek eyeshadows that I use all
the time so I feel like I don't use my
palettes as much I know which is really
really bad because I have so many of
them and they're not cheap if I had to
choose one palette it would be the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills shadow Couture
palette mainly because it has all of the
crease colors it has a really nice like
orange ebert brown color which I'm
obsessed with it has a dark brown it has
a black it has a champagne it has a gold
it has pops of colors this would have to
be yet my favorite palette that I own I
use this actually all the time on
clients I have this in the studio so I
don't have it at home but it's seriously
the best palette for what I'm traveling
as well I actually always take this when
I travel so yeah this would have to be
my favorite eyeshadow palette next up
lashes now I've never really had a
favorite pair of lashes because I just
use whatever's in my drawer whatever is
easy whatever I just feel like so I
don't really have like that one pair
that I would always go to but I love
recently I've only had these lashes for
maybe three weeks now and they have
become my favorite they are the Koko
lashes in the style Queen B I'm wearing
them right now I've actually worn these
lashes six times now and they're not
dead
it's so long and wispy they're dramatic
they can be worn when you're wearing
minimal make-up they can be worn when
you're wearing Germanic makeup they tie
in with like every single makeup look
I'm going to go order like 20 pairs
after this video actually that reminded
me I only have two days left okay now
onto lip products my favorite lip liner
by far is the drug
Maddox shear lip liner we're sure sure
dude I never know how to pronounce that
I use these daily I love the nude one as
well but this one is my favorite I'm
wearing it today
I use this on all my clients as well
they are literally the best formula of
lip liners I've ever used in my life if
you haven't picked it up you need to
I'll leave a link down below and a
discount code if you're interested
seriously the best lip liners ever this
was also a really hard decision but then
I was like what lipstick do I wear
pretty much every day and that is the
one that I'm wearing on my lips now it
is modesty by Mac it is in the cream
Sheen formula which I particularly
prefer in MAC lipsticks just because I
feel like sometimes velvet teddy which
is the matte one can make my lips really
dry and it just makes them look like
shriveled and smaller but I found when I
wear the cream Sheen formulas it makes
my lips look plumper nicer bigger so I'm
really loving the cream Sheen formulas
by Mac recently I only have two colors
but yeah this is definitely my favorite
lipstick if you don't have it you need
it favorite liquid lipstick this was not
hard for me to choose from at all it's
got to be the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills
dusty road when I first got this maybe
about a year ago now I wore it every
single day it's almost out it's like my
first liquid lipstick that I've almost
run out of like the logo is just even
rubbed off the formula of these also are
really really really good they don't
feel drying on the lips I do sometimes
put like lip gloss or a lip balm over
the top if I don't want that matter of
fact but I feel like it still lasts even
when I do have those products on top so
that is why that is my favorite liquid
lipstick so next up favorite gloss I'm
not much of a lipgloss wearer I don't
really have that many in my collection
but I really really enjoy the Rimmel oh
my gloss this is in the shade clear I
use it on my clients as well just over
the top of lipstick sometimes I love it
because it doesn't taste bad it's not
sticky it's just a plain clear gloss
that looks amazing
I'll put it on now actually so you guys
can see it's just like a really nice
clear lip gloss and it's obviously so
cheap as well because it's Rimmel so
yeah if you haven't tried
this then I would recommend it because
it's my favorite guy's favorite setting
spray is the urban decay D slick makeup
setting spray this is the oil control
one obviously because I have more oily
skins just amazing it feels so fresh on
the face and it definitely makes your
foundation lasts so much longer I
remember this one time I forgot to spray
this before I went to work at the end of
the day I looked at myself in the mirror
and I was like is that really what I
look like and I realized I hadn't
sprayed this so this makes such a
difference in your makeup routine like
honestly if you don't have this in your
life you need it so I think that's
everything and if I forgotten something
oh my god I'm going to be so pissed off
but if I have I'll leave it in the
description box down below let me know
if you guys want me to do more like
chitchat II like sitting down videos
like this maybe like monthly favorites I
used to film most ages ago but I felt
like I'd rather do like makeup tutorials
and like doing something while I'm
talking rather than just like speaking
directly to a camera but yeah if you
want to see more videos like this where
I sit down and chat let me know in the
comments below thank you so much for
watching again and I'll see you in my
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
