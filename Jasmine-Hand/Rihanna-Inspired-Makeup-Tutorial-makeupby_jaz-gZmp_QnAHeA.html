today I've decided to do a Rihanna
inspired makeup look I was absolutely
obsessed with this photo I'll insert it
here the minute I seen it and I was like
oh my god I have to recreate this look
ASAP so if you would like to know how to
get to this makeup look then please keep
watching I was thinking I'm gonna do my
whole face from scratch just because I
feel like I haven't done it in ages
because I haven't had time to post many
YouTube videos just because I've been
really really busy with uni stuff so I'm
gonna do everything on scratch sorry
I've westeros my face I just cleansed it
and I'm gonna use I'm going to use the
Australis primer the original one of
course the day that I decide I'm gonna
film a video my skin breaks out so next
I'm going to use my own Oxus skin
perfecting pore vanishing cream and this
is just a the same sort of concept as
benefit Porefessional
Thunder
I choose today
who knows
okay so now that I'm all primed and
ready
I haven't baked and yet I'm looking at
per se white girl I think I might gonna
look marvelous I want to you anybody use
my L'Oreal infallible in the shade 120
vanilla so I'm just gonna squirt a
little bit on this metal being above
that I got from eBay was like ten
dollars or something and just evenly
applying that
so I'm going to be using the LA girl Pro
conceal I've been using this a lot
recently this is in the color classic
ivory so I think this is the lightest
one I think and I'm just putting that
underneath my eyeballs and then I like
to blend it in or Pat it in with my
finger just because I've noticed if I
use a beauty blender um little speckles
kind of come up and it looks really
disgusting I don't know why anyone else
has experiences let me know I'm going to
use this Maybelline fit me concealer in
a lightest shade I believe and doing
this
good stuff
if it is set to my face I'm going to be
using the stay map by Renoir I've really
been liking this to set my foundation
recently so I'm just going to grab a big
fluffy brushes from Jessup if you don't
know what Jessup it is it's from eBay
and holy they're amazing it in a
post on them a few days ago and I listed
the seller in their caption so if you're
interested I'll actually use some of the
eye brushes today so you can that's
going to leave my under eye area for the
moment so I'm just going to use the Beau
desert bronzer to bronze up my face a
little bit it is amazing
and I'm gonna use my hoola by benefit
I'm gonna try out this new boss of
Beauty come to a brush looks exactly the
same as the knowledge anti a brush so
let's see how this works
it's really dense so using a really
sharp contour so I probably have to
blend it out a little bit so now that
that's done I'm going to bake my face it
sounds so weird
but it is seriously my favorite
technique for the moment
what I use is the face of Australia
translucent powder and then I just use
one of these angled sponges I got this
from cosmetics plaster and sure you can
just get it anywhere and I'm going to go
underneath my contour so you can I want
to make a line directly underneath where
you just come to it
and then I like to bake my concealer so
I'm just popping that underneath my eyes
and this I swear to you won't make your
concealer crease at all it's amazing
actually I'm gonna contour my nose first
so I'm just going to use one of these
little mini haul brushes I got this in
one of the benefit sets and I'm just
going to use hauler again to contour my
nose so
I'm not the best at contouring noises I
just have to beat this noise to contem I
swear to God
okay now I'm just gonna grab more of
that translucent powder and pop that
down the bridge so usually I just let
that bake for like 10 minutes and that's
how long it takes to do my brows I'm
gonna do eyebrows all right now okay so
this a high brow kit comes with a
highlight a darker and a lot of bright
and then some wax but that's Jill
actually you might be kind of like the
deep breath
okay so now that that's done I'm just
gonna use an eye primer so I'm just
gonna use my essence
I love stage I love this primer so now
I'm going to brush off the excess I'm
just going to use a big fluffy brush so
I'm just literally brushing off the
excess
as you can tell
the line is very crisp so if a blush I'm
going to use the the bomb Swiss dot
blush this is a Jessup brush it is a
powder slash blush brush
and she's actually wearing quite a lot
so
I'm gonna put more on what pull that
looks a bit too much and if I highlight
I'm just going to use my mary-lou
manizer by the balm and I'll try and
find my Jessup the brush here it is
Jessup tape it highlighter brush and I'm
just gonna pop that on the highest
points of my cheekbones oh yeah okay so
I'm going to use this Jessup brush now
I'm just going to use maybe I'll just
use this color from the chocolate bar
just to start off defining my crease so
I'll do that first so I'm going to use
the color valve from the Naked 2 palette
and pop that in the inner portion of my
eyes
okay and then I'm going to go in with a
bus tip just on the same brush
take make up these pics in now run that
above
okay I'm gonna take some more of that
love color and pop it on my lid and now
I'm just blending it all out so it's
seamless with the Jessup brush I think
I'm going to use my mac's blacktrack
I'll enough to be honest I don't really
like it I'm just using it so I can take
it back to get a free lipstick but it's
just not as good as I thought it would
be like it's it's black but it's just
really hard to use I feel
so I'm just going to use that same eye
line up to line my waterline
so I think I'm going to use my la mink
lashes in first class is what they look
like and they are just amazing
okay they wait 30 seconds
while that's drying I'm going to finish
off the bottom lashline I better grab
the black and start go away it starts
smoking that bottom lashline so I'm
going to use the meet Mac nude palette
and take Matt Garcia which is a really
really dark brown and I'm going to use
that to kind of diffuse the black so it
doesn't look so lucky I'm actually going
to try this all the proper thing it's by
candy lips I'm gonna do
gave me a little bit of an extra
pout okay so I'm gonna line my lips
I'm gonna use a mixture of Jeffrey stars
celebrity they're not celebrity skin'
unicorn blood and lime crimes utopia
they come down

bit but thank you guys so much for
