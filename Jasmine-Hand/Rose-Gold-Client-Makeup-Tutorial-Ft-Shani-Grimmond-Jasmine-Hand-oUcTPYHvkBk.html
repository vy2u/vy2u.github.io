I'm going to get straight into it I
don't have enough time for an intro so
for primary duty laura mercier radiance
primer i've never used this before this
was Shaunie's and it was just the first
thing that I saw so that's why I popped
it on and then for foundation I'm using
the hourglass vanish seamless foundation
stick this one's in the shade shale and
as you can see I'm just placing that on
her face first and then blending it out
with a Beauty Blender I kind of wish I
used a kabuki brush though because it
was really really hard to blend out I
would say this foundation is more suited
for people with drier skin just because
it got a little bit oily on me because I
have oily skin even shiny said it does
still get a little bit oily and juhi on
her skin and she has dried to combo skin
so yeah I just thought I would mention
that it's amazing coverage I love the
color it matched her fresh to actually
had wet tan on so we were hoping and
pray that it would match and it matched
absolutely perfectly so yeah I'm just
buffing that in with a damp Beauty
Blender
for concealer
surprise surprise I'm using the
Maybelline fit me in the shade light and
just placing that underneath her eyes
then I go ahead and place it around to a
nostrils Cupid's bow chin down the
center of her nose and then a little bit
on her forehead and then blending it all
out and setting the concealer with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder
sometimes I use a sponge sometimes they
use a brush it just depends how I feel
in the day I feel both techniques work
well so I'm just using the reborn large
highlighter brush for this and yeah just
packing on the product underneath her
eyes
then taking the astrologer fresh and
flawless face powder in the shade medium
tan just using that to set the rest of
her face then for brows I'm using the
essence eyebrow kit I can't believe this
is only like three dollars from
Priceline I used to use this years ago
when I was first starting out with
makeup so it brings back some memories
on the ends and then at the start I'm
going in with your lighter shade then to
carve the browser I'm using the fit me
concealer again just on a concealer
brush and as you can see I'm just going
directly underneath and above the brow
then to set the brows in place I'm using
the Australia's tint my brows in the
shade brunette I also used to use this
years ago and it's still one of my
favorite although I don't know where
mine is so I have to repurchase it and
then I'm going in with a large powder
brush and just wiping off the excess
powder from the baked
so to contour I'm using hoola benefit of
course just on a reborn small powder
brush and just placing that in the
hollows of her cheekbones I actually
went reverse and did contouring and then
bronzing after I don't know why I just
understood it that way that day so yeah
as you can see I'm just using swelling
motions and placing it on a cheeks jaw
and on her temples
then for bronzer I'm using the map give
me some this is actually Shaunie's
favorite bronzer so I thought I would
give it another whirl I've got it at
home but I feel like on my skin tone it
comes up Orange on me but it looked
amazing on her so I don't know if I'm
doing it wrong but yeah so I'm using
that to bronze her face up
then to bake a contour i'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder again
just on an angled sponge and as you can
see I'm just drawing a line from the top
of her ear to the side of her mouth then
for blush I'm taking Mac warm so I'm
just placing that on the apples of her
cheeks and dragging it up to the sides
of her temples as you probably already
know I'm not much of a blush person but
I love this because it's so neutral and
it's kind of like in-between a blush and
a bronzer gives a bit of color but not
too much which is perfect for me and
then I used her artist Couture
Illuminati loose powder highlight and oh
my god I need these in my life
look at that highlight though then I'm
just wiping off the excess powder from
the baked
then for the eyes to prime them I'm just
using the Maybelline concealer in light
again blending that in and then setting
it with a I think I just use a
translucent powder but any light powder
or eye shadow will do it's really
important to set the lids so the
eyeshadow blends seamlessly and then for
the transition shade I used frappe by
makeup geek just on a large crease brush
by reborn and blending that through the
crease and upper crease area and slowly
building up the color to a intense kind
of burnt orange shade
then taking the Kylie cosmetics rose
gold cream eyeshadow and I'm just
placing that basically on her whole lid
although next time I use this product or
any cream eyeshadow in general I'm not
going to set my eyelids just because I
found that it kind of went flaky because
it was applied on like a such a dry
surface so yeah next time I'm definitely
not going to powder my eyes before I put
this on I'm just going to put it on
straight away so that's like the only
downside of using this but it's such an
amazing color I'm seriously so obsessed
with it then I'm taking americano by
makeup geek and just placing that on the
outer corners of her eyes
americana is basically like a brown with
a purpley sort of undertone it's amazing
then I'm just adding a little bit more
of the cream eyeshadow just mainly to
the inner corners of the eyes because we
lost some of the pigment when I was
blending then taking americano again I'm
just taking that on a zoeva eyeshadow
packing brush I'll leave the names down
below as always and I'm just smoking
that onto her bottom lashline because I
didn't want to put anything too dramatic
in her waterline I just decided to use
eyeshadow so I picked up corrupt by a
makeup geek and I'm using that on a
really fine liner brush and I'm just
placing that directly underneath her
lower lash line and then blending it out
so it still looks smoky but not overly
dramatic just because I find that when I
put black in the waterline it makes the
eyes appear smaller and we did not want
that today we wanted to make her eyes
look as big as possible so yeah that's
why I decided to just use eyeshadow x'
then I'm taking the covergirl super
sizer mascara and holy I was really
blown away by this it's really good by
the way this is Shani so that's why I
used it directly on her eyelashes
obviously if she was a client I would
use disposable mascara ones then for
lashes i'm using the huda beauty in the
style audrey these are so amazing and
dramatic and I'm just used the duo lash
glue to apply them them also just
applying some mascara on the top just to
blend her falsies with her real
eyelashes and then applying some on her
bottom lashes as well then taking the
balm meet matrimony palette I'm taking
the black which is the bottom right and
I'm just using that to hide the glue
from the lashes and I kind of just added
a little bit of black in the outer
corners just to make it a bit smoky
because I wasn't adding any liner and I
felt like it needed a bit of black to
kind of make the look complete then
doing a little bit of nose contouring
using the hoola benefit just on a reborn
like this is just an eyeshadow brush she
doesn't really need much nose contouring
because she's already got a small narrow
no so I didn't really need to do much
and then I'm going in with lip liner
this is one of the new Urban Decay glide
on lip pencils I'm unsure of the show
I'll have to message her because this
was actually hers and I didn't write it
down damn it but I'm just slightly over
drawing her top lip because why the
not
then to fill in the lips I'm using
Geoffrey start and drogyny oh my god
this is probably my favorite Geoffrey
style liquid lipstick every time I wear
it I get so many compliments it's just
perfection it's probably my favorite
darker nude shade in my whole entire
collection like that's how much I love
it
it's so good and then because that dark
liquid lipsticks are a bitch to apply
I'm just going in with some concealer on
a concealer brush just to really sharpen
up the edges to make them look perfect
and then I thought the inner corner was
lacking some slate so I added a full
cloade more of that artist Couture
Illuminati powder holy I need it so
bad then going in with the mac lipglass
this is just a clear one it's so thick
but apparently shiny said that it was
comfortable on the lips because I was
like oh god this is going to be so
sticky and like uncomfortable which was
like it's actually really comfortable so
I need it in my life now it's so nice
the lips look so wet and just amazing I
loved the way it looked
then I'm spraying with the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray and that is
the final look I hope you guys enjoyed
