channel so today's video is going to be
another in a salon client blog but
before I get started on the vlog I just
wanted to quickly let you guys know that
myself and princess Polly are hosting a
competition basically what you can win
is a whole day with me at princess Polly
headquarters here on the Gold Coast so
if you're not from the Gold Coast you'll
be flown here and you'll be staying one
night at the island hotel so each of you
will be given a princess Polly prize
pack as well and we'll be filming some
content for their YouTube channel so
I'll be doing makeup looks on you also
showing you guys some of my tips and
tricks as well so for those that want to
enter I'll leave everything that you
need to know in the description box down
below I actually can't wait this sounds
like such a fun day always is that
princess Polly so yeah I thought I would
quickly mention that before the vlog but
last weekend I did some formal girls in
the salon so I thought I would vlog it
because who doesn't love fresh young
faces to film so I thought I would bring
my camera along and film everything for
you guys so I hope you guys enjoy
watching this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up for me and subscribe to
my channel for more videos and I'll see
you in my next one bye guys
keep me
