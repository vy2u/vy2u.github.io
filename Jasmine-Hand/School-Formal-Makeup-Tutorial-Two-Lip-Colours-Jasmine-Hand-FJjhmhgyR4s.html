name is jazz and in today's video I have
done a collab with the amazing Krystal
Conti here on YouTube as well we decided
to go for a formal inspired makeup
tutorial for all of you Aussies here
that have their formal in November we
decided to go for true different lip
colors so if you'd like to see how we
created this look then please keep
watching and then go over to Crystal
channel and check out her video ok so
first up of primer it is really really
important that you wear a primer
especially when you're wearing makeup
for a long period of time as it
obviously prolongs the wear of your
makeup so I'm using the hourglass
mineral primer it is amazing for oily
skin and combination skin I've heard it
is quite pricey though if you're not
much of a primer person but I probably
would suggest just getting a sample from
mecca for free if you're not willing to
spend so much so if the foundation I'm
using the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
I love this foundation especially in
photography because it has no SPF in it
which means there is no flash back
whatsoever and I'm just mixing it with
my Mac strobe cream so my face looks
very radiant and glowy
so I like to buff the foundation in
first with my Sigma f80 kabuki brush and
then I like to go over it with my DEP
Beauty Blender I just feel like this way
just makes my face look the most
flawless rather than just blending it
all in with my kabuki brush or all in
with a Beauty Blender so yeah
and then to further cover my blemishes
I'm using the mac prolongwear concealer
in nw20 5 and just putting them on my
gross pimples that need more coverage I
love this concealer especially if the
blemishes and then I'm going in with my
favorite under-eye concealer which is
the Maybelline fit me in the lightest
shade and placing that underneath my
eyes on my chin Cupid's bow down the
bridge of my nose and on my forehead and
of course blending it out with a damp
Beauty Blender and then I'm using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot just to prime my
eyelids this really cancels out the
redness in my eyes and I guess keeps the
eyeshadow on for a very long time if
your not wanting to spend so much on it
I would just recommend using any light
concealer so now I'm just setting my
under eye area with the Laura Mercier
trend isn't powder this stuff is
seriously so amazing it feels like silk
and I would highly recommend it plus
this elf blush brush it is amazing best
duo ever
and as some of you already know I have
my eyebrows cosmetically tattooed so all
I do is carve the bottom of the brow
with a light concealer and a concealer
brush as you can see and then as per
usual setting the rest of my face with
the Australis fresh and flawless face
powder in the shade darkest Brown and
I'm just using a Jessup large powder
brush for it and then going in with my
favorite bronzer which is the hoola by
benefit on this Thalia Jade angled
contouring brush only the links down
below where you can purchase her brushes
wrong so I'm just putting that in the
hollows of my cheekbones on my forehead
temples and along my jawline
and now I'm going in with you so either
Lux face paintbrush and defining the
contour a little bit more I love this
brush because it's so narrow and it
really really carves the cheekbones out
nicely so now I'm baking my contour and
for this I'm using the face of Australia
translucent powder but you can use any
translucent powder of your choice and
I'm just using this with a angled
cosmetic sponge that you can get from
literally anywhere and as you can see
I've just put a big fat line underneath
my contour wait 30 seconds and then a
brush off the excess I don't like to
keep it on for that long otherwise the
line becomes a bit too harsh
so yeah for blush I'm using at the
benefit coralista blush absolutely love
this blush because it's not too much I'm
not really much of a blush person
anyways
I'm so sorry these first two clips are
out of focus but I'm just applying a
transition shade and I'm using creme
brulee by makeup geek which is just a
soft brown color and then I'm going in
with the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette and as you can see I'm using the
darkest color in the palette which is on
the screen and I'm placing that in my
crease with a zoeva I'm pretty sure it's
called a crease brush but I'm kind of
creating like a soft cut crease book
and then I'm taking the bottom-left
highlighter shade and placing that on my
brow bone and all over my lid and also
in my inner corner and then I'm grabbing
more of the dark brown shade and adding
it to my crease because it lost some
color and I'm probably just gonna be
blending for days so I'm just going to
show you what I'm doing
and then for the wing I'm using the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and I'm
using my zoeva winged liner brush for
this and as you can see I'm just
creating a medium-sized wing
so now I'm just taking the dark brown
and placing that on my lower lash line
and then blending it out so it looks a
bit smokey and not bare and then I'm
grabbing the the balm cosmetics mr.
right now eyeliner which is just a nude
color and placing that in my waterline
so now I'm just popping on some mascara
this one is the Too Faced better than
sex and then for lashes i'm using the k
luxe mink lashes and i'm pretty sure
they're in the style maria if they're
not I'll have them all listed in the
description box down below anyways
so for the nude option I decided to go
with the boldly bare lips lineup by Mac
and I decided to pair that with the
Gerard cosmetics buttercup lipstick
which is just as you can see a really
light nude pink color it's not a color
that I would particularly wear on a
day-to-day basis but heaps of people
seem to like nude pink colors and I
actually didn't mind
um how it turned out on me so yeah this
is the nude pink color and then for the
red I decided to go with the famous Ruby
woo so I used the ruby red lip liner and
the Ruby woo lipstick by Mac and this is
how it turned out so I hope you guys
