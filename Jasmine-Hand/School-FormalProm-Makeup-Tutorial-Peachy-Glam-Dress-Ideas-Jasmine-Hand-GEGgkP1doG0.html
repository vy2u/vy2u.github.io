the voice-over for this makeup tutorial
so first up I'll be going in with primer
I'm using a that Gala benefit primer
it's a brightening primer and yeah I
just wanted to achieve a really nice
glowy base and for foundation I'm using
the Too Faced Born This Way in the shade
sand and as you can see I'm just running
it on her face first and blending it all
out with a damp Beauty Blender so for
the Santorini collection we decided to
go for a really flawless
juhi bronzy base so that is what we'll
be doing today and for the eyes we
decided to use peachy nudie tones I'm so
obsessed with how the look turned out
and I hope you guys enjoy it as well
for concealer I'm using at my absolute
favorite which is the Maybelline fit me
in the shade light and as you can see
I'm just placing that underneath her
eyes and then I go ahead to place it on
her chin Cupid's bow area forehead and
then down the bridge of her nose and
then I go ahead to blend it all in
with a damp Beauty Blender
then to make sure the concealer doesn't
crease all night long I'm using the
laura mercier translucent powder and I'm
using a baking technique to set that
area and I'm just taking that on my damp
Beauty Blender again and packing it
directly underneath her eyes then to set
the rest of her face I'm using the
Australis fresh and flawless face powder
I actually only put this in the areas
where I'm going to bronze just because I
wanted to keep the face Julie so I
didn't want to set it so yeah I only put
it in where I'm going to Braun so along
her cheekbones jawline and then a little
bit on her forehead for brows I'm using
my uh Nastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow
palette I'm taking the shade soft Brown
is just a brow powder super easy to use
and I'm just using that on a pony
cosmetics eyebrow brush one of my
favorites and just lightly filling in
her brows
then to define the brows I'm taking the
maybelline fitme concealer again in the
shade light and just using that on a
flat concealer brush and defining the
bottom of the brows
then again using that same concealer I'm
using that on her eyelids as an eye base
then just setting it with a powder just
to make sure that the eyeshadows blend
seamlessly on and then now I'm just
taking off that excess powder from the
under eye it baked two bronze I'm using
the Too Faced Sweethearts bronzer
obsessed with this product because it's
glowy as well so I'm just placing that
on her cheeks and then I go ahead and
place quite a bit on her forehead just
to give the illusion of a bronzed
sunkissed look then to slightly contour
i'm using the hoola Benefit bronzer just
with the brush that it came with
then to bake the contoured area which
will make the cheekbones look more
defined i'm using the laura mercier
translucent powder again and I'm just
using that on an angled wedge then after
a few minutes I'm just brushing off the
excess powder from the baked
then taking at the two-faced sweethearts
blush in the color sparkling Bellini and
just placing that on the apples of her
cheeks for highlighter I wanted a really
intense glow so I decided to use the
Anastasia Beverly Hills so Hollywood
highlighter which is a pure gold and it
is absolutely stunning so I'm placing
that on the highest point of her
cheekbones then I go to put it on her
Cupid's bow and on the tip of her nose
so now on to eyes I'm using a creme
brulee by makeup gate cosmetics as the
transition shade it's just a really nice
warm toned brown color and yeah I'm just
using windscreen wiper motions in to her
crease then taking a darker and more
terra cotta warmer brown and also
placing that in her crease just to give
it a little bit more dimension
then for the lid I'm taking the Kylie
cosmetics rose gold cream shadow
unfortunately because this was a limited
edition it's not available anymore but
the mac-10 pigment is literally the
exact same color and gives off the exact
same finish so if you wanting to go for
this look for your formal or special
occasion that I would 100% recommend the
Mac 10 pigment then going in with mock
up by a makeup geek and I'm just using
that in the crease area as well to give
it a little bit more dimension and then
I'm also running that along the lower
lash line as well then for mascara I'm
just using the benefit roller lash but
obviously for hygiene reasons I'm using
that on a disposable mascara wand it's
really really good for separating and
lengthening as well as thickening the
lashes it's a really good mascara then
for lashes I'm using these studio mink
angel mink lashes which are available on
the website for you to buy and I'm just
putting them on with some Jewish glue
and then I went on and put some mascara
on her bottom lashes Phillips we decided
on a really pretty peachy nude so to
line the lips I'm using Giraud cosmetics
nude lipliner and then the lipstick we
used was the rimmel london kate moss
shade 40 true apricot nude oh my god
Rimal lipsticks are so underrated they
are so affordable and absolutely
beautiful so if you're on a budget and
you're looking for a really pretty
peachy nude lipstick then I would 100%
recommend the Rimmel ones they are
amazing and then over top I'm just using
a clear gloss I'm using the Too Faced
lip injection in the shade a milkshake
so this is the final look I hope you
guys enjoyed watching and if you do end
up doing your own makeup for your formal
or special event coming up soon I hope
this gave you some in spot thanks again
for watching and we'll see you in the
next video bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
