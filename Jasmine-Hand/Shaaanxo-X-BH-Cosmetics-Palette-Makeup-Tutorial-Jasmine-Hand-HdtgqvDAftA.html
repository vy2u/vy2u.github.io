so today's video is going to be this
makeup look that I created with the new
shinik so BH Cosmetics palette oh my god
these eyeshadows are freakin amazing I'm
obsessed I'm obsessed with it like they
blend so seamlessly the colors are so
pigmented I'm so so so happy with this
palette and how the look turned out so
if you would like to see how I created
this look then keep on watching so the
primer I'm going to use the benefit
Porefessional and it's just a pore
minimizing primer I love to use it
around my nose when I can remember I
actually had this private like at the
very very back of all my primer so I
forgot I even had it so I found it the
other day I'm going to start using it
again
so in foundation I'm going to use the
chichi fabulous and flawless in the
shade 5 I got a bit of a tan when I went
to Bali but we can't really see it much
but I don't have any fake tan on hope
this matches me so I just squirted a few
pumps on the back of my hand
hopefully this matches me I absolutely
love this foundation I used to use it
all the time the other thing I don't
like about it is a smell like it smells
like like sunscreen I don't know it's
more so weird but I really love the
coverage and the color the thing I don't
like about it is that you need a lot of
it although it doesn't look cakey so a
little doesn't go a long ways you have
to use quite a bit of it um to get full
coverage but otherwise it's a really
good foundation and relatively cheap as
well
Oh concealer I'm going to give these a
go again the first time I tried it I
don't know why I just felt like it
didn't really give me like the coverage
that everyone is raving about and I'd
get these like little spots when I'm
blending it out with my Beauty Blender
am I the only one that gets like little
dots after I blended it out I don't know
but I'm gonna give it a go again yeah
what it just came out of it it's
abnormal okay I'm just kind of like
mixing it on the back of my hand because
it's a bit watery I haven't used it in a
while I'm going to apply it like I would
normally apply concealer oh this is in
the shade classic ivory so not the
lightest shade
yes I'm going to try to blend that out
again
everyone always raves about these
concealers but I just haven't got them
to work for me for some reason like they
kind of I don't know if you can see but
you can see like little speckles of the
concealer like I don't know if they're
like if it's like breaking off but so
weird
see what it looks like I don't know
maybe it's just me maybe it'll look okay
after I've baked and stuff but I just
feel like I can still see the redness
underneath my eyes like even after I
just applied heaps of it on maybe I'll
try and put a bit more on I don't notice
anyone else not like these concealers
sure there's got to be someone okay I'm
going to go in with it again and
highlight my forehead bridge of my nose
cupids oh and here actually saw you know
that makeup artist it's like G or a
versed Arden something like that but
she's from Russia I saw her at all that
she did on who - beauty I keep saying
hot I always think it's hotter
anyways who - beauty and she does this
when she um highlights so I'm gonna try
it out
I don't know what I'm going to do here I
guess I'm just going to kind of blend
I don't know I just feel like I need
more coverage here so I'm going to go
and grab my Medellin fit me concealer
one sec okay so I've got my fit me
concealer now I'm just going to place a
few dots just where I have redness and
I'm going to put it on my eyelids as
well maybe I shouldn't have tried it but
I guess it's good because you guys know
like how it applies and stuff but yeah
I'm not a fan I'm going to bake with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder
and I'm just gonna set the rest of my
face with the estrela's fresh and
flawless of course if a bronzer I
decided not to use benefits hauler I'm
going to use my essence fun Club runs up
for brunettes and you can just get this
from Priceline or from the drugstore as
you can see I love this bronzer I used
to use this all the time before I
discovered hoola
so reunited this also smells like
sunscreen so we're all by the way I'm
using my new spectrum cosmetic brush and
they are freaking amazing they're really
really soft and they blend really nicely
so um yes I want to ask me if I could do
like a mini review on them they're
incredible and definitely worth the
money like they're not just pretty like
they're actually really good that's what
I was kind of worried about when I got
them I actually bought that mermaid set
and then I got these one sent to me
because I think they saw my Instagram
photo or something but yeah they're
definitely worth the money
you
I think I've fallen in love with this
blender again and it's only like seven
dollars so to come to I'm going to use
the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
and I'm going to use thorn which is the
lightest shade I'm just going to use
this same brush because it's really good
for contouring as well
I'm just going to lightly contour my
nose using fawn as well so the blush I'm
going to use the elf blush in peachy
keen
doesn't look too pigmented so you're not
quite sure how this is going to look oh
yeah
it's got a really nice Sheen to it
actually
so the highlighter I'm going to use this
palette and I'm going to use Marylou
which is this one and I'm just placing
that of this highlighter there's like
goals so amazing Oh probably put it too
much on the brows I'm just going to use
my Anastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow
palette and I'm going to use soft brown
which is that one at the top
yes I'm just grabbing some leftovers
from the LA girl Pro concealer and it's
carving even this conceal is shit for
carving brows like what the hell I hate
it I'm just going to use the Maybelline
one I like how the Maybelline concealer
is more like a yellow based whereas the
LA girl one is more like pink base which
is not what I like it I can see law
in Napa the exciting bit I'm going to be
using the new Shan EXO BH Cosmetics
palette so it comes with nine eyes
shadows which look gorgeous and then
nine lip colors let's take the film
which look like that I'll be use I'll
use one of the lipsticks as well as the
eye shadow so you guys can see what they
look like I'm going to go in with this
color in my crease as a transition shade
I already really like BH Cosmetics like
I've already got some bitch cosmetics
eyeshadow palettes and I've just got the
Holly Bible color palette and it's like
one of my favorite palettes because the
eyeshadows are amazing these blend so
nicely as well now I'm just using a
smaller blending brush and I'm going to
take this color my god it looks amazing
and I'm just going to work that in my
crease or this color yes
oh god this is so pretty I think I'm
going to go in with this sort of
champagne color I'm going to spray my
brush with a bit of this so it
intensifies the eyeshadow bullshit ah
luckily I bathed long publish within
eyes first
but that's right okay so now I'm going
to take the darkest color and I'm just
going to work that on the outer V just
to make that eye look a bit more
dramatic
that I'm just using a blending brush and
blending it together
so describing some more of that first
transition shape and kind of blending so
everything looks seamless so I just
realized it stopped filming but I just
used this shade to highlight my inner
corners and my brow bone and so that's
all that you guys miss today I'm just
going to line my waterline with the
Maybelline eye studio Oh hate doing my
tight line
then taking the pallet again I'm just
going to take that terracotta color and
use that to smoke out the lower lash
line now just taking a bit of that
transition color and I'm going to take
the tart clay paint liner and I'm going
to use that to line the top of my eyes
check your mascara I'm going to use the
Tarte lights camera lashes and SCARA to
the lashes I'm going to use the Fillion
lashes in the style Gigi
with ellipse I only really think these
true would suit the eye makeup look like
I don't think any of the brighter colors
would sue I didn't really want to wear
it but just because I always wear this
shade of nude I'm just going to wear it
because I think that it's going to go
with the eyes the best so I'm just going
to line my lips with saw lip liner by
Mac
so this is the finished look and I
really loved how it turned out like
seriously congrats on inform aching this
palette honestly these shadows are
amazing I love the colors I love the
pigmentation and they are super easy to
blend and I also really really love the
lipstick can't wait to try the other lip
colors and different eye looks using
this palette so I'll definitely be doing
another tutorial featuring it but yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed watching don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up if
