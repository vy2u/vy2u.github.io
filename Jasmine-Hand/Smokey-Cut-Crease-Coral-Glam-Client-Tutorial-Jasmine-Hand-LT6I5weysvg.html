filmed one of these so I'm gonna get
straight into I'm just using the benefit
cut brow in the shade number three and
just using my pony cosmetics eyebrow
brush just to fill in her eyebrows
then was taking a light concealer it's
probably the Maybelline fit me in the
shade light and just using that on a
concealer brush and just using that to
define the brow so I just place it above
and below and yeah it just makes a
really nice crisp line
then just placing some concealer on her
eyelids true act as an eye base and then
I like to set it with the Rimmel stay
matte translucent powder and just really
packing that on just to make sure
everything is nice and set just for
eyeshadow to blend a little bit more
seamlessly then I'm taking the new
prison palette by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and taking that dusty sort of rose
color in the bottom right hand corner
and just using that in the crease as a
transition color so I'm just pretty much
focusing this color mainly in the crease
and above just because we are creating a
cut crease and I kind of want those
colors to be visible after I've created
the cut crease so I'm just really
building up that color then I'm taking
this gorgeous coral color and I'm also
placing that in at the crease area so
yeah just really focusing on building
the color with that as well
then taking this dark coppery shade and
I'm also working that in the crease just
true it define it a little bit more then
just using it the dark brown color from
the palette and I'm also working that in
the crease
so now I'm just taking it some
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
light just on a concealer brush and this
is what I'm gonna use to it cut the
crease so as you can see what I'm doing
I'm literally just cutting in the crease
and then choose set the concealer I'm
taking the shimmery white from the
palette and just packing that all over
the top then taking a tiny blending
brush just with some of the dark brown
again and just going over the crease
just to define it a bit more as well
then taking some black eyeshadow and I'm
mainly just focusing that on the outer
corners and blending it up
since the liner I'm just taking the
Maybelline no no I was gonna say fit me
the Maybelline master precise liner and
just using that just to line the tops of
her eyes then taking some more black on
a small type of brush and just blending
out the sides of the line I just to make
it a little bit more smokey then for
mascara I'm taking the Maybelline
colossal and just coating her top lashes
in preparation for falsies and the
falsies I used were the model rock - one
- and I used duo lash glue then I'm just
priming her face using the new Becca
perfecting primer I'll leave it listed
down below anyways but I'm just putting
that all over her face and then I'm
using the Stila stay all day in the
shade buff 7 and applying that first
with a brush and then blending it all in
with a damp Beauty Blender
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 20 and just using
that underneath her eyes and then I'm
going ahead to place it down the bridge
of my nose Cupid's bow chin and on our
forehead and then blending it out
then to set the concealer in place and
taking the Too Faced translucent powder
and just baking that baking that
pressing that underneath her eyes with
my Beauty Blender then taking the Mac
Studio Fix pressed powder in the shade C
for and just using that to set the rest
of her face
then I'm moving on to lower lashline I'm
taking the same coral color and just
really smoking that out on the lower
lash line and then I go ahead to use
some of the brown as well and I really
press that into her lower lashes I'm
just wiping away the excess translucent
powder finds it the eyes you can I want
to make sure to use not a dense brush
for this because sometimes or when I
used to do this I used to just use my
powder brush and it was too dense and it
kind of just like ruins the under eye
area so I use a really really light
fluffy brush for it and then I'm just
going over the eyelashes with some liner
and then two bronze I'm taking a need to
face Sweethearts bronze are my favorite
just on a contouring brush and then it's
a lightly contour I'm just taking the
hoola by benefit just using the brush
that it came with and just chiseling out
her nose cheeks and jaw then taking the
Too Faced translucent powder again and
just using that to bake the contour then
taking the Too Faced sweetheart blush
and placing that on her cheeks and yeah
I really love this blush because it's so
glowy and just makes the skin look
amazing
then I'm going in with mascara just to
mesh her real lashes with the falsies
and then I'm going in with highlighter
I'm taking the UH Nastasia glow kit the
sugar one which is new and just taking
the gold color and just popping that on
her cheekbones Cupid's bow and the tip
of a nose and a little bit on the bridge
then I'm wiping off the excess powder
from the baked what is she even saying
she's so funny I love her
okay that's enough talk but I'm taking
it the Australis metallics cream
eyeshadow this is just the white one and
this is what I use look in the corners
all the time I use it on myself as well
everyone always asks so amazing then I'm
just cutting her lower lashes and then
going in with the Gerard cosmetics shell
lip liner I would a discount code for
these they're amazing you should
definitely grab some but I'll leave the
discount code down below I'm just lining
her lips and then using a model rocket
liquid lipstick I'm unsure of the shade
but I'll try and find it and leave it
listed down below for you guys so I'm
just placing that on her lips and then
I'm just going in with a Marc Jacobs
sugar sugar lip gloss and that is the
final look
