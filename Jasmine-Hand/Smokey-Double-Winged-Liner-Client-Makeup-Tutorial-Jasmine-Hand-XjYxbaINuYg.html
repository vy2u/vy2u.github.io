channel so first up I'm going in with a
guy named Ursula water just on a cotton
pad just to make sure the face is all
nice and clean for the primer then for
primer I'm going in with the benefit
that gal I love this primer especially
for clients with more drier skin it just
makes the face look nice and dewy
underneath the foundation so I'm just
stippling that all over her face with a
makeup addictions cosmetics stippling
brush then for foundation I use the Mac
Studio Fix fluid in NC 35 and I ends up
only using about one pump of this just
because I didn't want a full coverage
because obviously she doesn't need it
her skin is already so flawless so I'm
just blending that all in with a damp
Beauty Blender
and till you discover it is with any
child you forgiving
but I be better on my
then to conceal her under eye area I'm
using the Maybelline fit me of course in
the shade light and just placing that
underneath her eyes with a concealer
brush then I went on to put it on her
chin Cupid's bow around her nostrils on
her forehead and down the center of her
nose
then to bake her under eye area and
using the RCM a no color powder I was
recommended this by one of my
subscribers and all my god it's actually
really good when I first put it on I was
like holy this is so white with
them once you brush off the excess
it looks really flawless so I would a
hundred cent recommend this product if
you're not keen on spending around $70
for the Laura Mercier one but I do still
love my Laura Mercier one so yeah but I
do actually really like this one as well
and then to set the rest of our face
really lightly I'm using Australia's
fresh and flawless face powder and this
one's in the shade darkest Brown
then I'm priming her eyelids with the
maybelline fitme concealer as well in
the shade light and then just blending
it all out
then setting the eyelids with the same
translucent powder just to ensure that
the eyeshadows blend seamlessly then to
bronze and using the hoola benefit
bronzer just on my angled spectrum
cosmetics brush and as you can see I'm
just placing that in the hollows of her
cheekbones jaw line around the
perimeters of her face temples and then
down the sides of her nose
then to chisel out her cheeks a little
bit more I'm just using the brush that
actually came with hoola which is
literally one of my favorite contouring
brushes ever and just placing that in
the hollows of her cheekbones
then taking the same RCM a translucent
powder I'm just using that to Baker
contour the other thing I don't like
about it is the lid like it's really
awkward to like dispense so I had to
actually put some in my hand to use but
yeah I'm probably just going to like get
a little pan or something to put it in
and then for blush I'm using the NARS
orgasm blush it's one of my favorites at
the moment and then to highlighter I'm
using the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in Champagne pop
from start you my bunny
I'm your club from now to eternity I
give you all my heart we are meant to be
it's clear to see my lover's bigger than
outside I got everything I want when I
hold you with my mother my love my
pleasure the key to my treasure when I
was two whether there but now with you
killer how many times were you on the
truck I want you to notice the one and I
know this horrific soulmate I want to
show my best friends then for brows I'm
taking the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills pro
brow palette I'm using the shade soft
brown on my favorite eyebrow brush which
is by Pony cosmetics and just filling in
her brows
then just taking some more of that
Maybelline concealer just to really
carve out the bottoms which will just
give the brows a more sharper look then
for the eyes I'm taking some tape I
never use tape I hate using tape just
because I hate like a really strong line
of eyeshadow but for this I found that
it's probably the best thing for it so
what I'm doing isn't just grabbing tape
and placing that on the sides of her
eyes parallel to the end of her eyebrow
and then I'm going in with creme brulée
by makeup geek as a transition shade and
just buffing that into her crease
then going in with the Maybelline gel
liner in black and as you can see I'm
just placing that on the outer corner of
her eye and then I'm grabbing a tapered
blending brush as ones by zoeva as
always I'll leave a brush list down
below I haven't got any product on the
brush all I'm doing is just really
smoking and smudging that liner out
then probably for the most satisfying
part of the video I'm removing the tape
from either side of her eyes and then
I'm just cleaning up where the tape may
have taken off some foundation and
concealer
then taking shimma shimma by makeup geek
and placing that on the lids I felt like
it really needed this shimmery eyeshadow
just to tie everything all together and
I really liked how it turned out
then to smoke out her lower lashline I'm
taking americano also by makeup geek and
just using that on a shader brush to
begin that the smoky process in the
lower lashline and then I go in with the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner again to
line her waterline
just using that same tapered zoeva brush
that we use to smoke at the top liner
I'm just using that on the bottom just
to make everything a lot more smoky err
then I'm just taking shimma shimma again
and just highlighting her inner corners
Cupid's bow and then a little bit on the
tip of the nose and then for mascara I'm
using the benefit roller lash just on
some disposable mascara wands and then
for lashes I'm using my favourites which
are the model rock to12 lashes which you
can get in a bulk pack for a hundred
dollars for fifty pairs
so then randomly I decided to add a
double wing I haven't done this before
so I was just playing around so yeah I
can't really explain exactly what I was
doing but basically I've just grabbed
corrupt by makeup geek which is just a
black matte eyeshadow and I've just
intensified the outer corner of the
lower lash lines and then I just grabbed
a eyeliner brush with this same
eyeshadow just in matte black and then I
just created a line directly underneath
the top wing and then just blended it
out and hope for the best pretty much
and it did work out I actually really
liked how it turned out I know if I
prefer it without it or with it but I
just went with it and I guess I liked
how it turned out
philip's I went with show lipliner by
drug cosmetics I probably use this lip
liner all the nude one in like every
single one of my clients and I pretty
much use them on all my clients
I love how creamy they are and I love
the colors so yeah I used sure and then
to fill in
I used honey love by Mac I've had this
for ages but I just never get around to
using it just because it looks so light
in the tube I'm just lettin up that's
just going to wash them out it's just
going to look like concealer on the lips
but I've really been enjoying it lately
and have been using it on more quiet
it's not like how matte it is so then I
like to put a clear gloss on top so yeah
the clear gloss I use all the time is by
Rimmel I can't remember the name for the
life of me but I'll definitely leave it
listed down below it's super cheap it's
not sticky it doesn't smell bad doesn't
taste bad I love it so this is the final
look and I hope you guys enjoyed
