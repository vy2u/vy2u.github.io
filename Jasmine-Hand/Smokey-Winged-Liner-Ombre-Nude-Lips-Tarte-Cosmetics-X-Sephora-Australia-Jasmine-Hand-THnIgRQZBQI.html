gonna get straight into it again I'm
just going in with a tart timeless
smoothing primer and applying that all
over my face it basically acts as a pore
filling primer really really similar to
the benefit Porefessional
it's amazing and it makes the foundation
look amazing as well and then I'm going
in with the Tarte 24-hour Amazonian clay
foundation and this isn't the color tan
sand and I'm just putting that all over
my face with a small concealer brush and
then buffing it in with my dab Beauty
Blender
and then i'm going in with the tarte
maracuja creaseless concealer and this
one's in the shade light/medium I'm
pretty sure I'll list it down below if
it's not and I'm just placing that
underneath my eyes on the bridge of my
nose forehead Cupid's bow and a little
bit on my chin and then also blending
that out with my damp Beauty Blender
this concealer is so hydrating
underneath the eyes it's really really
nice and really lightweight so yeah I'm
actually really really loving it so far
and then I'm going in with the tarts
smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing
powder and just setting the rest of my
face and then I'm just taking more of
that translucent powder and kind of
packing that underneath my eyes to set
my concealer because I wanted to make
the under eyes a little bit more
brighter and actually own its heart
bronzer or contouring products so I
decided just to use the pull up benefit
bronzer as per always and you can get
that from Sephora as well and then I'm
going in with the it's hot blush in the
shade blushing bright and just putting
that on the cheekbones no apples on my
cheeks
on my cheekbones I'm putting the
mary-lou manizer by the balm which you
can also get from Sephora all the
products that I use today you can get
from Sephora calm a you and then for
brows I'm using the Tarte Amazonian clay
brow pencil and I'm pretty sure this is
in the shade medium matte Brown if it's
not I'll leave it down below and I
actually really really like this pencil
it's really really similar to the UH
Nastasia brow is and yeah I just liked
how eyebrows turned out
and then using the same maracuja
creaseless concealer I'm just using that
on a concealer brush and carving out my
brows so for eye shadow I'm gonna be
using the new tartlet in bloom palette
and I'm gonna go ahead and take
sweetheart and I'm just buffing that
into my crease and using that as a
transition shade
and then taking the color leader I am
using that on the same brush and I'm
just placing that into my crease just to
give it a little bit more depth and then
I'm just spraying a bit of fix+
on a eyes shadow shadow brush and I'm
grabbing funny girl and just placing
that all over the lid and then just
using the same blender brush as before
and just blending those two colors
together and then I go ahead and go back
in with funny girl just to make it a
little bit more pigmented and then
placing that on the inner corner area as
well so then I'm going in with the shade
activist on these same blending brush
over using the whole eye look I've only
used this one brush and I'm just
deepening the crease I felt like I
needed a little bit more darkness and
then I'm going in with the clay paint
liner in black and aligning my eyes and
creating a little bit of a wing and as
you can see I kind of stuffed up the
wing but I saved it by just getting a
little bit of concealer and a concealer
brush and kind of cleaning up the sides
of the wing you'll see in a second but
yes
and then go back in with a palette I'm
taking the color smoke show and I'm just
smoking out my eyeliner with a at
tapered blending brush
and then just taking these same clay
paint liner and lining my waterline
so now taking activists again on a it's
kind of like a I shadow packing brush
and I really like this for smoking at
the lower lash line I'm using that to
smoke it out and then I'm taking rebel
to make it kind of transition into like
a soft smokey eye if that makes any
sense at all and then I'm going in with
funny girl again and then just going
over my lid with it just because during
the blending process you lose a little
bit of pigment so I'm just going over
that again and then blending it all
together so next I'm taking the lights
camera splashes waterproof mascara and
just putting that on my top and bottom
lashes
in preparation for false lashes so now
for my favorite part of the whole look
which is the lips and I decide to create
like a nude ombre sort of type look so
I'm just lining with the lip crayon in
lleida gram and then I'm going in with
the lip cream in TBT and then in the
center I'm using the lip cream in
namaste and I'm just using my finger to
blend those colors together
so this is the finished look I hope you
