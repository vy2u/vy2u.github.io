channel so today's video is going to be
another snapchat to a night I've done
one of these on my channel
I need years ago and yes I am in my
pajamas and I seriously hope it with the
changing so yeah I'm comfortable and
that's all that matters sister after you
guys on snapchat 270 some video
questions there can be questions about
anything makeup
personal life whatever so I'm just going
to go ahead and open them I'm going to
scroll all the way down oh yeah
pondering want the best piece of advice
you've received about journey makeup and
all that thanks to the best piece of
advice that I could give you guys for
starting either like a freelance makeup
business or just getting into makeup in
general is to just go for it so it makes
you happy then that's all that should
matter I always say if you have a
passion for something just go for it and
I try and keep my answers really thank
you so much when I was Malina was just
added with a most like to collaborate
with will have always been a fan of
nikkietutorials love the way she does
makeup I love her personality and I
don't know I just love everything about
her makeup so I would absolutely love to
collaborate with her and as for my
favorite youtuber I would probably have
to say yeah Nikki I love desi as well I
haven't really watched as many videos as
I used to watch just because I've been
so busy with my own videos but if I had
like a chance to sit down and watch
videos I would definitely watch those
too
how do you motivate yourself I probably
have to say early wake up for like
weddings and stuff I know that's not
really makeup like related but I know I
was just trying to think of something
that I genuinely hate and I literally
can't think of anything that I hate so
much so I need motivation to do just
because makeup is literally my life and
I could never picture myself doing
anything else so yeah I would have to
say early wake up I'm not a morning
person the only time I get up early is
if I'm going to the gym obviously my
motivation for that is to have a good
body so yeah I would have to say early
wake up literally the worst especially
we have to make of a like spray em hey
love you um I've always had long hair
from a really young age I don't know I
use Evo shampoo and conditioner if that
helps but I really hardly use heat on it
so the only time I would really like
blow-dry and straighten my hair is if
I'm going out or if I'm filming like I
didn't actually like blow-dry my hair or
threaten I just literally curl the ends
of it I don't know I just don't like to
apply that much heat to it so maybe that
could be a reason why it grows but I get
regular cuts maybe once every six to
eight weeks so I don't know if that's
supposed to help or not but I don't know
I've just always had long hair I'm a
particular try to program I learn your
your clients thank you so much and for
other
oh that's so cute
thank you so much Andre are not going to
lie when I did start I was so afraid to
do rings liner because I wasn't 100%
confident and doing other people like I
would master it myself but then when it
came to doing other people I was
petrified so when someone was like yeah
I want to win I'd be like I don't think
that would suit your eye shape I
literally would say that just so I
didn't have to do it because I don't
know I would always stop it up but I
guess as I kept practicing and did more
and more clients I became more and more
confident with doing winged eyeliner and
now I always ask them on like do on a
wing I want to do a wing I love doing
wings now I just think wings just make a
dramatic eye pop I love doing wings
liner now so yeah
practice does make perfect I guess the
worst part is spending a lot of money to
build up your kit like I remember I
spent a shitload of money when I first
started off and I couldn't afford most
things so that really sucked because I
just wanted everything and obviously
back then I couldn't afford it but I do
build your client base obviously you
then get money to build up your kit and
the best thing about being a makeup
artist is just making people feel
beautiful and just to look on their face
when they look in the mirror for the
first time I don't know I just love that
feeling it just makes me feel amazing so
yeah I think that's the best part of my
job to show it's so rewarding
hey guys wondering if you could come up
with any makeup brands what would it be
oh if I could collab with any makeup
brand probably I thought like Benefit
Cosmetics just because I love so many of
their products anasazi Beverly Hills
would be pretty cool but they always
seem to do like collab arkin it would be
pretty cool to collab with Mac
though they're only like colorful
celebrities or whatever but I know it's
not be pretty cool as well
hi jasmine text wanna let you know that
I love love your work it's beautiful and
I wanted to know where the Becca
highlighters that you recommend for
wedding thank you so much Laura so I
don't really use Becca highlighters as
much as my Mac soft and gentle that's
like my go-to I pretty much use up on
everyone except a giant users on my
really pale clients because sometimes I
don't know like when they turn it kind
of reflects like a golden color and if
you're fair it kind of I don't know it
comes up as like a darker shade than
your foundation so I don't use soft and
gentle on my power lines but I do love
pearl by backup that's like their press
tile and I think that's really nice um I
also do love champagne pop and opal as
well okay so I was just wondering on
your favorite interest acquisitive
stickers and also did you watch 30
reasons why and if you did work I would
have to say favorite nude liquid
lipstick I don't really use liquid
lipsticks much but I'm wearing it now
it's the bear at all by Gerard cosmetics
lip stick favorite lipstick is modesty
by Mac for sure I literally wear that
all the time with saw lip liner and no I
haven't seen 13 reasons lash and I watch
it I've heard like mixed reviews like
I've had people been like oh why do I
just watch that and then they will say
it's amazing so I don't know let me know
in the comments below if you've watched
it and if I should watch it because yeah
I'm undecided
I know if I'm gonna waste my time if
it's good
let me know in the comments below
actually a really good question because
in my confirmation text I actually write
make sure you bring a photo or like the
style of makeup that you're wanting or
even just like colors that you like so I
have like an overall gist of like how
dramatic or natural they want the look
for example if someone just comes into
the chair and says I just want like a
gold from OPI well there's like
different variations of gold smokey eye
like you can either make it
my liquids like in the waterline winged
liner like a heavy contour I just like
to see a photo of what they want their
makeup to look like just so I know
exactly how they want it so I think it's
definitely a great idea I'm for makeup
artist to ask their clients to bring in
a photo so yeah I found that it helped
me out a lot because I never used to ask
people to and when people would bring
you a photo when I hadn't asked them I'd
be like well yeah and I'll just make it
so much easier so yes we want to ask
what your favorite brand of makeup also
we wanted to know what your favorite
store to get makeup is if you have one
self
yeah we love you oh I love that accent
my favorite brand I guess I feel like I
get asked this all the time probably
Anastasia Beverly Hills and benefit I
love those brands and favorite store to
buy and makeup from probably Mecca
Maxima I would definitely a hundred
percent go full be like every day of my
life I would rather this than a natural
look a hundred percent love you too I
think she asked what age do I think I'm
gonna stop doing makeup I don't know
just whenever it dies I don't think
makeup will ever die but I can see
myself doing it for a long long time so
not anytime soon
so basically the only lighting that I
use is a ring light so I can't really
show you guys but I've just got a ring
right here it's probably about I don't
know this big I got it from eBay it was
only about I think 170 dollars and I've
had it for three years so it's going
strong so I have one of those in the
salon and then I did take my pictures
with my tenon 600d I just put the camera
right in front of the ring light and
take photos with flash is literally all
I do and I picked photos again
a white wall that is all I don't have
any other fancy lighting or anything
it's just a ring light and then my timer
okay so I go oh we go Wow what's the
most Awkward date I've been on with a
guy I've got some awkward dates in my
head but I feel like if I say them
they'll probably watch the video because
they're psycho yeah I'm not I'm not even
going to mention it cuz I probably get a
message but what I didn't even get that
time to replay it
I have I meet George and Alex so Alex
went to school with me so obviously met
him through school and I actually met
George at a gay club and we just like
clicked instantly and we've been like
best friends ever since
so yeah thank you so I've gotten heaps a
question about this so I go to a group
fitness sort of class or they do like
cardio weight training and boxing so I
do that four to five times a week I try
and go in mornings and at night but I
can be lazy sometimes I do try and go to
all the night sessions so I'm doing that
yeah four to five times a week and I'm
taking the meal replacement shakes once
or even sometimes twice a day I take the
shapes for breakfast and then I would
have like chicken and veggies for lunch
and then I would have a shake after
training just because I don't really
feel like having a meal after like a
full intense cardio session but I've
been only recently having one shake a
day so I'll just have it for breakfast
and then for lunch and dinner I'll just
have something clean like like I said
before chicken and veggies or yeah just
something healthy you cannot ask me that
of on a diet now I'm kidding I would
have to say Lynch's my favourite brand
and love those
cannot live balls oh my god and I didn't
have one chocolate or Easter are you
proud of me I like you a lot I'm just
going to have one but then I realized if
I have one I'll have a hundred so I
didn't even have one chocolate over
Easter at all nothing
I'm so proud of myself that's funny um
well to be honest I probably couldn't
ever picture living anywhere but the
Gold Coast
I'm obsessed about Chris I always get
asked if I would want to move to you
know expand my brand or whatever and
like to be honest I don't think I would
want to I'm really happy with where I am
now actually just bought my own place
recently that I'm moving into soon which
I'm so excited about so I do definitely
want to be here for another couple of
years so I don't know maybe if I get
like opportunities elsewhere I would
consider moving but for now I am
definitely so happy here on the Gold
Coast so I think that's enough questions
for now I hope you guys enjoyed watching
I love filming these types of videos so

then let me know in the comments down
below and I'll see you in one of my next
