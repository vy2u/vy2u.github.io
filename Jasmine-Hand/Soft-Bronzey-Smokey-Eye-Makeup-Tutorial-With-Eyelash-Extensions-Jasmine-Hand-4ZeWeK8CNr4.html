channel so today's video is going to be
of this full face makeup tutorial but
mainly focusing on the eyes in this
video I have teamed up with Rimmel
London Australia to show you their new
scandalised eyeliners and mascara so if
you would like to see how I created this
eye look using the new Rimmel London
goodies then keep on watching so first
up I'm just going to go and fill in my
brows then I'm just grabbing some
concealer on a concealer brush and just
using that to define the brows
and then to start the face I'm going to
go in with a pore filling primer just
around my nose and chin area just cuz I
have heaps of like textured bumps and
lumps then it going in with a foundation
and I'm just using my Beauty Blender to
blend that in it is going to look really
dark because I don't usually tan my face
so it will definitely blend into my neck
by the way I'll leave everything I do is
down below and just going in with a
lighter concealer and just using that to
conceal and highlight to my under eye
area
then on the chin Cupid's bow forehead
and down the bridge of my nose and then
just blending it all in with the same
Beauty Blender
then I'm just going to set that
concealed area just with some
translucent powder this just ensures
that the concealer won't crease
throughout the day or the night then I'm
taking it the Rimmel long-lasting and
finishing powder this is in the shade
silky beige I'm just going to use that
to set the rest of my face and I'm going
to go in with the Rimmel stay matte
powder and just use that to set the eyes
just so the eyeshadow blends seamlessly
then I'm just going to wipe off the
excess bag then I'm just taking a
bronzer to bronze up my face then I'm
just going to take a translucent powder
again and just use that to bake then it
just going in with a blush and applying
that on the apples of my cheeks and then
just applying some highlighter on my
cheekbones oh yes I love highlighters so
much so I'm going to do something really
bronzy and kind of effortless because I
want the eyeliner to be the main star of
my eye makeup so I'm just going to go in
with a transition shade so I'm just
using a really like warm toned soft
brown I'm just taking a gold and just
using that all over the lid
just going to take a deeper brown color
and just concentrate that mainly on the
outer corner
I'm just going to take that same brown
shade and use that underneath my lower
lash line
and I'm just going to put that same gold
in the inner corner to highlight it so
now I'm just going to wipe off the bug
so they've actually come out with two
different eyeliners which are felt tip
one of the liners is really really fine
so it can give you that really sharp
wing look there's the other one which is
a tad thicker if you just wanted to use
liner on the top and you didn't want to
do a wing you could do a wing with it as
well but the other one is way more
precise and easier to do a wing these
are what the eyeliners look like I'll
open them up now so you guys can see the
comparison in the tip size the eyeliner
at the top is actually called the
precision micro liner which pretty much
speaks for itself because it has a
really really precise thin tip all right
the one in the bottom is called the
thick and thin liner which is actually
angled if you can kind of see that I'll
try and do an up close of both of them
as well so I've just done a swatch of
both liner so the top one is obviously
the thick and thin liner I use the
thicker side to create that and then the
bottom one is the precision micro liner
and they also come out with their new
scandalized reloaded mascara I'll open
it for you guys and show you so that is
what the wand looks like she became to
try this one out today as well so I'm
going to zoom you guys up and show you
guys how the eyeliners and mascara work
let's start off using the thick and thin
liner to just line the top and then I'm
going to use the micro liner for the
sharp wing so so far really really
pigmented and easy to use well so I'm
just going to leave it like that for now
I'm going to go in with the other eye
now I'm going to go in with the micro
liner and I'm going to use that to
create the wing so what I want to do
first is create the outline of the wing
so like that I'm not going to go from
the very top I'm going to go from about
here and then just drag it straight down
that was super super easy switch it to
coming to the other side now I'm
actually really really impressed with
those wings usually I would go for more
of a thicker wing but because I have
eyelash extensions and I can't put any
falses over the top and I'm just going
to be using mascara I think that those
wings like really really compliment the
eye makeup okay so now that the line is
done I'm going to go ahead and try their
mascara the Rimmel scandaleyes reloaded
mascara I know I have eyelash extensions
but it is safe to put mascara over the
top so I'm just going to coat them
then for lipstick I'm going to go in
with the Rimmel Kate Moss collection in
the shade of 55 my nude I got these the
other week and I was literally dying
over the colors so I'm soaking to try it
out oh my god yes that is amazing what
the hell so this is the final makeup
look I hope you guys enjoyed watching
