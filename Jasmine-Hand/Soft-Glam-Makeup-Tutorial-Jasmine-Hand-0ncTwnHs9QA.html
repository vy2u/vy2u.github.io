so I'm just starting off with some guy
named Estella water just to remove any
excess makeup or anything on her face
before priming and for prime I you see
benefit Porefessional matte rescue then
on to brows I'm taking the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills program palette I'm taking
that D shade darkest brown or weight
dark brown and using that to fill in her
brows she has amazing brow so I only
lightly filled them in
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade 25 and using that
to define the brows so I just want to
concealer brush and placing that above
and below just to give a really nice
crisp defined line then taking the Mac 6
pass spray spraying her face before
foundation I mix a little bit of the
becca shimmering at liquid skin
Perfector in opal in with some Mac
Studio Fix in n at C 40 putting that all
over and then blending it all in with a
damp Beauty Blender
since the concealer I'm taking the top
shape type in the shade medium and just
placing that underneath her eyes and
then blending it out with the damp
Beauty Blender I also put it down at the
bridge of a nose forehead Cupid's bow
and chin as well
then taking the alarm sei translucent
powder and just using that to set
underneath her eyes
then just taking some clear brow gel
because I forgot before and just
throwing that through her brows and then
set the rest of her face and taking the
Mac Studio Fix press powder in NC 42 and
yes setting the rest of her Foundation
so I should said - without the morphe
brushes three-five oh I'm just taking at
that first shade there which is a
perfect transition color and of course
buffing that into her crease first and
then the lighting kind of stuffed up
here I'm sorry I think it's because I
was showing the colors close up on the
morphe palette then taking this kind of
like coppery color like ready sort of
brown and using that on the outer
corners and then just using my blending
brushes - I'll end it seamlessly then
taking this dark chocolate brown color
I'm also putting that in the outer
corners as well and slowly building up
the color and blending as we go
then taking this gorgeous champagne e
color I'm just placing that on the inner
corners of the either actually wet the
brush with a bit of fix pass before just
to intensify the shadow
since the lighter I'm taking the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills waterproof cream
color in the shade jet which is just
black and even that on my Sigma winged
liner brush which is my fave firstly
lining her eyes first and then going in
with the wing
then I'm just wiping off the excess
powder from underneath the I baked and
then going in with the same two colors I
used on the eyes for the lower lash line
and just blending that out then just
coating her lashes with some mascara I
Bridget I just used the pony cosmetics
white night just in preparation for
lashes okay I'm not sure which lashes I
use but I'll leave them listed down
below I think they were mink lashes from
a company that kindly send them to me so
I will leave them in the description box
down below because I have no clue and
then I'm using the meeting to turn
contour kit by anastasiya using that
middle shade and just using that to
sculpt out her cheekbones
then using the face of Australia
translucent powder just to define the
contour and bake that area as well so
just placing that directly underneath
then taking Jeffrey's ice cold is like
my favorite in a corner highlight I
don't like to use on the cheekbones
because I find it's a little bit chunky
and glittery but for the inner corner
its perfection and then I'm taking the
Too Faced sweetheart
blush and just placing that on her
cheeks is like my favorite blush for
clients at the moment and then for
highlight I'm taking opal by Becca I
forgot how much I love the formula of
these highlighters so I'll definitely be
using these a lot more then Phillips I'm
taking a Urban Decay glide on a lip
liner which I'm unsure of the color
which I'll just leave down below again
for you guys and just lining her lips so
lipstick I'm taking the anasazi up
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in the
shade catnip this color is just
absolutely stunning on her complexion I
think I I don't know I was just like so
obsessed when I put it on so just
applying that with a lip brush
and then to set the face and just taken
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray and that is the final look done I
