hey guys welcome back to my channel I
did a voiceover for this video because
the day that I film this it was a
boiling hot so I couldn't not have my
fans on so I'm going ahead with the
benefit professional applying that all
over my face to smooth out my skin at
then going in with the hourglass mineral
veil primer and also popping that all
over up my face then going in with the
other stars a beverly hills dipbrow in
the shade medium brown just on my
project cosmetics eyebrow brush and just
lightly filling in my brows
then going in with the Maybelline fit me
concealer I'm just using that to to find
the brows so just on a concealer brush
and just running that below and above
the brow then taking the Benefit
Cosmetics 3d brow tones and just running
that through my brows to set them in
place the foundation I'm mixing the Marc
Jacobs remarkable and the Stila stay all
day the remarkable is in the shade 54
and the Stila one is in the shade 8 mix
them together and distorting them on my
face first and then blending it out with
the morphe I think it's I'm not even
going to try and guess what I'll leave
it loose down below it's like one of my
favorite foundation brushes it's so good
so I'm just applying that all over and
then for concealer I'm taking the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in the shade
custard I recently been really really
liking this again when I first bought it
I didn't see the hype but now I do
really like it it's weird how you can
just hate a product and then go liking
it so here so I'm just placing that on
the forehead de Labarre nose Cupid's bow
and chin and then blending everything
out
then I'm taking the alarm FDA
translucent powder and just using that
to break and set my concealer underneath
my eyes
then I'm taking the astrology fresh and
flawless face palette in the shade
medium 10 I really need to find another
good face but I can use in my video so
I'm sure you guys are sick of me using
this one every time but it's my all-time
favorite so I'm just using that to sets
the rest of my foundation now taking up
Tuscan Sun by makeup geek and just using
that in my crease and / all over my lid
I didn't realize how pigmented it was so
yeah I'm just really buffing that color
into my crease and building it up
then taking wild-west also by makeup
geek and just using that mainly in the
outer corners of my eyes and building up
the color as well then taking the Too
Faced chocolate bon bons palette I'm
taking that really hot pink and using
that in my crease as well just because I
feel like we lost the pink from the
transition color and I wanted this like
a pinky cranberry type look so I'm just
buffing that in and then I'm actually
taking it the gold from the violet Voss
palette I didn't like show you guys but
it's more of like a coppery gold but
then I do go over it with the Too Faced
peanut butter palette the gold in there
just to make it a little bit more like
white gold you'll see what I mean in a
second
when I put it on
then I'm taking cherry cola by makeup
geek and deepening up the outer corners
with it I'm just using an under starsia
brush I'll leave all the brushes that I
use down below and then I'm just using
some translucent powder just to make
that line a little bit more crisp and
then I'm going in with the Tarte clay
pot liner and I'm just using a Nastasia
liner brush it's actually one of my
favorites it's so easy to do liner with
and just creating a little wing
then just taking a mixture of wild-west
and cherry cola and just using that to
buff into the lower lash line to make it
extra smoky and then I take cherry color
again on a more narrow brush I seriously
can't talk today and just use not on the
lower lash line as well then taking the
sleek palette and just using that to
highlight my inner corners I wanted a
really bright in a corner and this
palette is amazing like so so amazing
for the price then I'm curling my lashes
and then for mascara I use the Tarte
lights camera lashes and mascara one of
my favorites and just coating my lashes
then just popping on some lashes I chose
the billion lashes in the style Casey
and then on to space I'm taking my hoola
bronzer just on a stippling brush I'm
actually really enjoying this brush for
bronzing up the cheeks I don't know why
it just works really well
Thunder placing that on my cheekbone
area around the perimeter of my forehead
and then draw and then a little bit down
these sides of my nose then I just take
the iconic angled contour brush and just
use that to define the contour a little
bit more and yes going along my forehead
as well and then I take the Kat Von D
shade and light palette it's the middle
shade and further contour my face then
going in with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder again and just using
that to define and bake my contour then
to blush I'm taking at NARS orgasm one
of my favorites and just popping that on
the apples of my cheeks
then taking this Mac highlighter I'm
pretty sure it was limited edition it's
so pretty exciting kits actually whisper
of guilt and I'm just using that all -
does the highlighter brush and just
applying that on the highest points of
my cheekbones Cupid's bow down the
bridge of my nose and yeah pretty much
everywhere excellent test with this
highlighter
since ellipse I'm taking one of my
favorite combos at the moment it is
thought lip line up by Mac this is sort
of my favorite Mac lip liner ever so
pretty it's such a me color and then for
lipstick I used Mac modesty it's
probably yeah
my favorite MAC lipstick as well so
popping that on and then over top I'm
going in with the Marc Jacobs lip gloss
remember what shade it's in but I'll
look it up and let you guys know in the
description box down below but yeah this
is like my favorite lip combo at the
moment and I think it's perfect for
Bridal then just spray my face a bit of
the all my Tarte by urban decay and this
is the final look done I hope you guys
