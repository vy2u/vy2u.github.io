so today's video is another princess
Polly Tryon clothing haul you guys seem
to love my last video so I thought I
would collaborate with them again before
I start princess Polly has actually
given me a discount code for you guys to
get 20% off everything online
so the code I'll probably just put down
in the description box but it's J h20 so
I'm just gonna jump right into it I
start off with tops so first top that I
got was just this really pretty red and
white striped crop top with little
off-the-shoulder sleeves I think this is
so cute for summer and yeah you can
pretty much wear with anything but yeah
I just think this top is super cute
next time I picked up was this amazing
scarf top as soon as I saw this on the
model online I was like I need this in
my life and it's actually really
flattering on when you put it around
like this because I kind of like
accentuate your waist so yeah you just
put it on like that fold it in half and
then just tie it around like that I'm
gonna either wear it with high-waisted
jeans or skirt you could like dress it
casually or you can like dress it up to
something fancy but yeah next top I got
was this flowy tie up crop top it's like
beige and white Schiele really have to
show you guys here so you'll see it
better when I'm trying it on just on the
side there yeah it just does up here
super cute for summer and yeah because
other dresses up or wear it casually as
well so yeah okay so this is a place it
this is probably one of my favorite
items out of them all so it's just a
black jumpsuit and the sleeves are off
the shoulder I think it's really really
flattering when jumpsuits or even like
clothes have this because it kind of
just like I know hides that area of your
arm but yeah that's what it looks like
has a big neck and then it just does up
at the back I'll be wearing this a lot I
can just tell and then I also got a
white denim skirt just because I don't
have one and I thought it would look
cute with some of the tops that I got I
did get this one in a size large because
I did try on the medium and it was like
really tight up here but then it was
down here so I took it back and they
gave me a large it still doesn't fit the
best like around here but I don't think
it's supposed to be a tight fitted skirt
it's more of like tight at the ways and
then they kind of suck flows out mean
your legs so yeah and then while I just
have this out I've got two bandanas I've
been obsessive wearing bandanas ever
since I got back from Europe so I've got
a navy one and a black one I saw on the
website that the girls wore the bandanas
like around the neck like this I don't
know if I'm like game enough to where
I'm like this but it looks really cool
on the models in the website so I don't
know if they supposed to be worn like
around the neck or on the head but I
prefer them to other than my hair so I
got two of those next up is this black
long cocktail type dress I guess you
could wear it out clubbing but it's got
a v-neck and the material is really
really fluttering like around the
stomach area it goes to about just below
the knees but yeah I really needed a
black plain sort of bodycon dress but
when I go out so yes I really like this
next I just got a plain cropped white
tee just looks like this and it's kind
of like gathered at the front here kind
of looks like a little knot but I don't
really have any cropped white tee so I
thought I would pick that up because
once again it would go with anything
next up is another one of my faves it's
also a black jumpsuit what's new it's
kind of like a stick sort of cotton
material so looks like this and then it
ties up at the back as a bow and then it
has a little zip but I really really
love this once again you can dress it up
or even wear it casually so yeah I
really like that one next I got this
burgundy sort of mini dress when I saw
it on the model I was like oh my god she
looks so good it's actually coming up a
lot lighter on camera than it is in real
life it's more of a dark sort of
burgundy color it's tight and then it's
got little frills at the bottom so cute
I actually really like this is next up
is this place it and I've mainly
check this out just for work because I
like wearing mesh tops and stuff when
I'm working especially when I'm out
doing weddings and whatever so I thought
this would look cool so it's basically
just a mesh top and then it goes into
like shorts but then there's a little
roller in built in it it's really hard
to show you guys on here but I'm sure
you're going to see it on the side there
I try it on but it fits really really
well and yeah I really like it so I
might wear it this weekend
next up is this thrilled eagle top I
literally don't have any basic sort of
tops to wear with just jeans so I got
this one I really really like it the
materials so soft and when I wear it I
tend to just make a knot here to make it
a bit cropped next up is a top that I
wouldn't usually pick out just because
it's like a long flowy top but then I
realized I was going through my wardrobe
and I try to find something like to wear
with a pair of jeans and I literally
only wear like tight singlet or crop
tops with jeans so I thought I would
choose this top it's really hard to show
you what it looks like on camera but it
ties up at the neck and it's flowy so
you can tuck it in and then it's just
got an off-the-shoulder sleeves and they
like a little bit puffy but yeah I think
this is really really flattering on when
I first tried it I was like oh shit this
is gonna make me look like a sack but it
actually does look really nice on so
yeah I paired it with some white jeans
and yeah next up is this crop top when I
first saw this on the website I don't
know why but these stripes reminded me
of Gucci because they're red and green
but I really love this top but it's just
Navy and it's a crop and it's got longer
sleeves so yeah I mean this is like one
of my favorite crops but I got I know I
got this denim skirt last haul but I
thought I would just mention it again
because I wore it a lot in the trial and
bit of the video so it's just a plain
blue denim skirt it's not too long but
it's not too short it's really really
flattering on this
in a size 10 but as I said before they
do stretch so just be mindful of that
when you're buying a denim but yeah this
is like one of my favorite pieces of
denim that I own I love it I wear it all
the time and I pretty much wore it like
every day in Europe and lastly I got
this crop top that I'm actually wearing
at the moment I love the pattern it's
kind of like beige with floral e like
past early patterns on it so as I was
doing a little Tryon section of the
video I forgot that I didn't show this
top so the final top that I got is once
again a tie up one at the waist but
these are a bit longer so they kind of
go down to about I'd say halfway to the
knees so this bit that ties I here's
halfway to the knees
at first when I got it I was like oh
that's not really my style but then when
I paired it with the denim skirt I was
like hey that actually does look alright
but it's not usually the type of top
that I would go for but I was pleasantly
surprised yeah I just wanted to quickly
add that one in so that is everything
that I got from princess Polly don't
forget to use my discount code if you're
interested I'll leave links below to all
