channel I thought I would do something a
little bit different and film outside I
don't know it's just something a little
bit different that's what I would spice
it up a little so for today's video if
you haven't already guessed by the title
I'm doing a princess Polly Hall once
again they're literally one of my
favorite online clothing brands I love
all their clothes I just love how they
fit as well like I find that sometimes
when I shop online I just like I'm not
sure about the sizing of the brands that
they stock so yeah I never usually shop
online but with princess Polly I know my
exact size I just know it's gonna fit
every time so we've had any further ado
I will show you guys what I picked up so
I'll start with shoes I picked up these
Bellini slides I guess they're super
comfortable and I'm like obsessed with
white this summer so I did actually pick
up quite a few white items I just think
these look really cute with any outfit
so I picked them up and I don't know
anything like that in my shoe collection
so I do dresses first so I picked up
this black dress looks like this and
it's hired up at the back I actually
have something quite similar but it's
just in a jumpsuit version so it goes up
quite high on the neck you'll see my try
on a little bit of the video but it's
super flattering and I liked it with a
belt so that's right and you go get the
belt that I got as well but yeah as you
can see in the Tryon bed I did also get
the belt and it kind of looks like the
Gucci belt I know just looks really cool
I saw it on the website and I was like I
need that in my life so yeah pairing it
with a belt looks really really cool and
yeah I really really like them together
so that is that so the next dress I
picked up is not something I would
usually I don't know it'd go for but it
looks super cute on the model and I'm
obsessed with white so it's just a dress
like this it kind of goes tight and then
a flowy towards the bottom just because
it's like frilly but I really really
think it's so cute for like lunches and
like daytime sort of events so yeah I
picked that one up and it looks really
cute on as well which is a bonus next
thing I picked up was three jumpsuits
in three different colors like there are
literally the exact same jumpsuit
because I was so obsessed with what they
looked like I was like a cow needs
all three colors so I picked it up in
red white and a burnt orange so
basically it is just a jumpsuit it's
like a t-shirt type jumped in it and it
ties up here so it's really really
fluttering I don't know I just think
they're really really comfortable and
they're like lights I have enough
material to actually cover your whole
boob I find that some tire pops that I'm
owned like they don't have enough
material here so when you're going to
tie it up like your boobs like flopping
out all over the place but this is quite
thick like this area to tie up so your
boobies will sit in place firmly so yeah
I haven't had any problems with like my
boob coming out and obviously you can't
really wear a bra with these kinds of
jumpsuit so you can wear like a beige
strapless bra but you can kind of still
see it here but sometimes what I like to
do if I do want to wear a bra with it
there's a like I tuck in the little tie
thing here and then you can't see it as
much but I think these are more suited
for like a no brass sort of look so yeah
these are really really cute so that's
the red one and then exact same one in
white and then this is the burnt orange
one I can't believe I used to do that
like when I was a kid I used to like
find something I liked and then I would
get it in all the colors that they had
like I was just so obsessed of doing
that next top I got is this tie up top
again I love this is like one of my
favorite items that I got it's just
really really nice like peachy blue
tones so it's like kind of long ish
sleeves actually not really probably
goes like down to here and yeah once
again
ties up at the boob but once again this
top does have enough room true
comfortably tied around your boob area
if you don't want to wear a bra but I
did wear these on the weekend with my
swimmers underneath and it still looks
really cool but yeah I really really
like this top next item I got is this
white skirt and I think this is my
favorite item out of the whole whole
just because I really needed a white
skirt that fit me well and it is so
fluttering like I just find denim skirts
that do up here like this like the buns
are always the most flattering
cuz they don't really you know how like
normal denim skirts that you zip up like
normally they're kind of like bulge
sometimes it kind of doesn't really look
that flattering but I swear with these
kinds of skirts that doesn't happen and
I'm obsessed like I love how it fits on
my body
I got a mini size 10 off by the way I've
got everything pretty much in a size 10
or medium I've got to tell you guys I'm
yeah this one's a little bit though to
be a washer it should took it out of the
wash for this video but um yeah this is
seriously like the best white denim
skirt that I've ever ever had like in my
life I love it
next time I got is just something really
really simple and plain it's just a
black crop top and it does up at the
back this is actually the same sort of
material and make as a dress it's just
like in a top sort of version so it goes
up quite high and then ties up the back
you'll see in the Tryon bit I'm sure
next top is actually one of my favorites
and I haven't worn it yet surprisingly I
haven't really had anywhere to wear it
but it's this white frilly sort of mid
crop top so it like goes a little bit
higher at the front and then it's like a
long at the back so you could definitely
wear it with like a blue denim skirt or
jeans whatever but yeah I think this is
really really cute and super flattering
as well just be so like cute for like
lunches and yes some art in general next
dress I've got is probably one of my
faves just because it's so comfortable
and it's just so easy to slip on it's
just this blue floral dress looks like
this and ties up here as well and I find
that when you wear a strapless bra you
can hide it with this so I do usually
wear a strapless bra with it or you can
wear swimmers underneath whatever it's
up to you so it pretty much just goes
like above the knees so yeah I think
that is all I got I feel like I'm
missing something
last but not least the top that I'm
wearing it is a mink pink one and it
ties up here I'm wearing a strapless bra
with it so you can't really see the bra
underneath obviously so yeah that is it
I feel like I just spoke for so long
without like having a breath oh my god I
just
I forgot one thing one second that we go
together so the last thing I picked up
was in this bag and I swear to God every
single girl has it now but I saw it and
I was like okay I need to jump on the
bandwagon and be cool and step out of my
comfort zone because this is not usually
my style but I don't know ever since
I've been posting like outfits sort of
photos on Instagram that's kind of what
I think about now and I like looking at
accessories and clothes and like oh yeah
that'll look good in a photo so I've got
this bag it is so cute actually took it
to the beach on Australia Day and just
like fits pretty much everything in it
it does have a little bit of a smell
though kind of reminds me of Bali but I
guess that's just because of like the
material that it's made from but I'm
guessing that'll just like fade away in
time but that is the last thing I picked
up thank you guys so much for watching
