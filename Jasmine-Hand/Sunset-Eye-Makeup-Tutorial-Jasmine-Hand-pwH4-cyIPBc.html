so in today's video I've done this
sunset inspired eye makeup look I don't
know what to call it but I am seriously
so obsessed with how it turned out
I haven't done much color on my channel
so I thought I would branch out and film
this look for you guys
so if you guys would like to see how I
created this look then just keep on
watching so for primer I'm going to use
the benefit Porefessional just around my
nose as always because I have heaps of
textured skin around there and it just
really helps to smooth it out and it's
going to pop that pretty much just down
the center of my face it also helps to
keep the face matte throughout the day
and then departing the rest of my face
I'm going to use the Gemological hydro
blur primer I've had this for ages and
I've really like hardly used it so I'm
going to just place up on the rest of my
face it's kind of got the same sort of
texture as Porefessional but it's not as
thick I remember to do my brows first
I'm just taking my Anastasia dip brow
which is what I used my brows all the
time now just on my pony cosmetics brush
you need a mirror and just filling in my
brows I need to get them threaded face
up so I start on the tails and then work
my way to just our standard taking a
concealer brush with some concealer I'm
just using the Smashbox Studios skin 21
I'm going to try to underneath my eyes
today because I haven't tried it yet
been sitting in my drawers for like
weeks now I'm just going to use that to
define the brows and then the top three
then why I do my brows first is because
if I do my foundation and then set it
with powder I'm going to be putting like
a liquid which is like the
conceal out over the top of the pattern
doesn't really sit nicely on the face so
just like to get brows out of the way
and then it just blending the concealer
out so then what I like to do to prep
the face is just going with the setting
for and just using the Garrard one for
foundation today I'm joining two Too
Faced Born This Way and I finally got
like a shade that matches my fake tan
completely sand is good but I find that
it has that gray sort of undertone so I
decided to get warm beige and it's going
to buff that in with my morphe m-43 9
brush yeah this color is way better than
sand what I'm doing is just pressing
that into little skin I could have
probably gotten away with like a shade
darker but I'll just bronze up my face
actually also got a darker shade of the
Stila stay all day which is like one of
my favorite foundations at the moment so
I got the shade 9 so what I'm going to
do is just put create up to that so
hopefully my face kind of goes a little
bit darker
then for under I can say I'm going with
the Smashbox Studios skin a concealer
and scaler this is going to be a little
bit too light but it's in the shade
light neutral click only yeah that's
pretty light that's right though and I'm
going to use my Real Techniques sponge
to blend it out haven't you just find
you ages so big compared to the beauty
blender a holy
oh wow this concealer is actually really
nice it's going to pop some down Center
down the bridge pieces throat and chin
and describing some of my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and using that to
fake I'm going to set the rest of my
face I'm just taking my strollers fresh
and flawless
okay so I've doing you guys up so you
guys can see I make up a little bit
clearer I'm just going to blend out that
concealer on my eyelids again so I'm
also just going to set my eyelids with
some translucent powder I'm actually so
excited to use color today because I
haven't use color on my channel in ages
and when I got this Smashbox
Hustler's up by the way Smashbox many
eyeshadow pallete disease colors I was
like yup done dead I'm definitely using
some of these shades I actually saw a
photo on Facebook and it was like a
sunset sort of inspired I so I want to
use like yellows and oranges and reds I
think just for something different cause
I've never done anything like it on my
channel before the first shade I'm going
to pick up is the orange so I'm just
going to use that in my crease
these eyeshadows are really really easy
to blend well I'm just mainly focusing
that pretty much in my crease and upper
crease area so I'm going to do like a
mini sort of cut crease kind of look
other size okay so now that we have the
base color I'm going to go in with the
red which is right next to it with just
a little bit deeper and just basically
go in the same area that we went in just
before but I'm just really wanting to
intensify the Cree holy
these eyeshadows are actually bombs
taking some more robe on this side and
really just focusing that in the crease
so now for the fun part
just going to take some more of that
concealer with a concealer brush and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
that to cut the crease I think I'm only
going to do half of a cut so I kind of
look weird when I like cut the whole
crease so if you've never done this kind
of method before all you have to do is
just look straight into your mirror find
your crease and just cut it just above
because the whole point of cut creases
is to kind of like make your lid space
look bigger you don't want to cut it
directly underneath I like to go a
little bit above so as you can see my
crease is there and then you just color
it in just like that
and then I'm just going to use this
brush to kind of like blend out the
concealer so it's kind of like not just
like a sharp end
okay and I'm just going to the lens I'm
just going to take like a bone or a
white eyeshadow and just use that to set
the concealer so now that that part
start I'm going to go in with the red
again and I'm really going to like pack
the product on my brush and just really
concentrate that on the outer corners of
the eyes
now I'm going to spray my brush with
some setting phrase fur I really want
this yellow to pop and I'm going to pop
the yellow on my lid on my bottom store
side of the dish I'm just packing that
all over the lid now I'm going to get a
bit fancy and take the Urban Decay razor
sharp liquid liner this is a silver one
and I'm just going to kind of like go
over that cut crease I'm just going to
do a wing and I'm just using the UH
Nastasia gel liner
I literally just like didn't even
breathe while I was doing that
okay the wings are finally on I'm going
to curl my eyelashes add some mascara
I'm taking the Tarte lights camera
lashes mascara so life is I'm going to
take the lash warrior lashes in this
style car
arunya colonial I don't know how to
pronounce it but these other style
lashes so now I'm going to go on to the
lower lash line I'm going to take the
orange shade again and just use that
underneath which we like for living for
this look right now taking a bit of
brown and using that in my lower lash
line it's like I need some sort of
darker color to give my eyes a bit of
definition
so in Iguala I'm gonna take the new
Anastacio
palette I don't know how to pronounce
her last name so I'm not even going to
bother that's so bad I'm going to take
daydream which is like a
Coralie highlight holy Fox it looks
amazing and place it dead
holy this is amazing the formula of
these highlighters and not like her
other glow kit if I might cut other glow
kits are a bit like glittery and not
buttery these oh holy
amazing going to zoom you guys out a
little bit okay I'm really hating how
white my face looks right now so I'm
going to bronze it the up with the
sweetheart bronze up by true face it's
like my favorite and go to town pretty
much this bronze is freaking amazing
love it
then it's going to take the cap on D
shade and light palette I'm going to
take the middle shade and just use that
to what stops out my cheeks and my
jawline okay better take this powder
bottom by this color I mean the face is
Australia one I'm going to use an old
favorite blush this is it is a matte
start lover so pretty it's like a coral
color pop it on my cheeks so pretty okay
I'm so excited for haha
for highlighter I'm going to use this
palette again it's so amazing I'm going
to use glow guitar which is just be kind
of Goldy sort of highlight I'm dead like
blood I'm not even like pulling that
much on the brush like that is giving me
life right now
keep it low
down here oh it surely can't deal with
this quo like like I just hope this
off no I've no idea what to wear on my
lips I have so many new lip colors that
I've recently got but I just have no
idea what to use do I use a nude do I
use an orange dry use a red so you see

burning I'm such a then last but
not least setting my face I'm seriously
so obsessed with how this turned out I
