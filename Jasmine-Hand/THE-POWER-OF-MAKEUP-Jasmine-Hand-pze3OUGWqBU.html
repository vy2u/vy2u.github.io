so today's video if you don't already
know by the title is going to be the
power of makeup so I obviously was
inspired by nikkietutorials which was
the original creator of her video if you
haven't already checked it out I'll
leave the link down below so you can
it's serious is such an inspiring and
amazing video so basically the whole
concept behind the power of makeup is
that makeup is an art I know there are
some people that put on makeup to
impress other people as well as making
themselves feel better
I personally am quite comfortable in my
bare skin I go shopping all the time
without makeup because I've just learned
to love myself without makeup I actually
have had people comment and say that I
looked so so different with that makeup
especially in real life when they would
just see me out in the shops just was my
hair in a bun just kind of like what
Nicki like said in her video she kind of
said that when she actually showed
people what she'd look like with makeup
when she didn't have makeup they didn't
believe that it's her so yeah I've
actually had some people come up and
said wow you look so different
like as opposed to full glam to nothing
and I completely agree with that like I
I know I look different and that is why
I love makeup because I love
transforming my face I love transforming
my clients faces and it's love full glam
like like I'm not dissing like makeup
artists for people that you know wear
makeup to you know enhance their natural
features and wear minimal makeup because
some of that makeup is actually really
beautiful but to me makeup is all about
glam
obsessed with like full-coverage
highlight contour lashes lips like I'm
just obsessed with and all that that's
why Nikki inspires me so much like she's
probably one of the reasons why I
actually started a YouTube channel
because my style of makeup is so similar
to hers like I just relate to her so
much in life like honestly she's amazing
so yeah I thought I would create my own
power of makeup so if you'd like to see
how I created this transformation then
keep on watching okay so because I want
like a crisp line I'm gonna use some
sticky tape but I know this is like how
you're supposed to do it but I'm weird
so hey guys
I'm going to do the makeup on this side
of my face
now I can't talk right up I'm going to
get some scissors but some scissors and
I'm going to cut I knew that was gonna
happen okay ready
oh my god Iowa oh my god Oh accessor
primer I'm going to use the advance at
professional and just rub that in I'll
take the sticky tape up after I do my
freakin foundation so it's not like on
my face a long time that I hold Prime's
I'm gonna go in with the l'oreal true
match foundation in the shade beige
cream which looks like that just apply
that with a Beauty Blender
so if you can see like I'm going to use
the mac prolongwear concealer in NC 15
is going to apply that
untains my eyes how's it's going to be
so hard and highlighting done my face
like half of it just blending that I'm
just going to fake that area with the
Laura Mercier or Mercier translucent
powder and then I'm going to set the
rest of my face with the Australia's
fresh and flawless this is in the shade
darkest Brown
ow
ah I shouldn't put it over mother my god
that different though that is so funny
I'm just gonna brush off the excess I
can't deal so now I'm going in with the
benefit cheekathon palette and it's
seriously the best like if you're a
makeup artist you should definitely have
this in your kit I'm gonna go in with
hoola which is yeah and just use that to
to bronze and contour through cheek bone
and then I'm just gonna go underneath my
jewel around the forehead area I'm going
to bake also with the laura mercier
translucent powder and while i have this
palette i'm gonna mix
coralista and dandelion the two blushes
fat one and okay that one actually I
might mix a bit of the rockatuer one as
well so I'll mix all of them
for them for our I'm gonna take my hat
off tanned gentle which I recently just
got it's so amazing but I'm gonna spray
a bit of my brush with a bit of setting
spray this is just the Gerard cosmetics
lay all day just go back to B's super
pigmented and I'm just gonna find out oh
my god yes this is like my favorite
highlighter at the moment I can't
believe that didn't buy it soon I like I
don't know why didn't I just probably
thought I had way too many holidays and
I didn't need this one but I'm so glad I
have this one oh it's so good so now I'm
just going to brush off the bite so the
brass I think I'm just going to use the
I'm estancia Beverly Hills dark brown
powder duo but this change is gonna but
I'm just going to use the lighter color
I'm just going to carve the brows I'm
just going to use the same nice feel up
okay so for eyeshadow I'm thinking I
might go a venture money just because
like that's kind of like the point of
this video I'm gonna go in with creme
brulee by makeup gauge and I'm just
going to use that in my crease
I'll face this way so you guys can see
and then I'm grabbing cocoa back and I'm
just using that in my crease as well and
then I'm gonna go in with shimma shimma
I'm gonna keep this whole makeup cake so
it's easy off and I'm just gonna place
that all over the lid and just taking
that other blending brush I'm just gonna
use that true blend those two colors
together I'm gonna take Anasazi Beverly
Hills fudge just on the same blending
brush and I'm just gonna kind of like
use that in my crease and then kind of
bring it down to the outer corner area
as well
and I'm just going to go ahead and
create a wing
I'm going to take the Maybelline eye
studio and use that in my waterline I'm
gonna grab cocoa back just on this brush
by Thalia J and I'm just going to use
that to smoke out the lower lash line
I'm Emma Skye I'm gonna take the essence
I love it strain which looks like this
and just coat my top and bottom lashes
infull actions I'm just puffing on
another one of my samples so I can't
quite tell you yet then fill it stick
I'm gonna use the jeffree star right
drum liquid lipstick
oh shit I forgot my lashes huh
got my lashes on hopefully it didn't
actually dry so I think I'm done hope
you guys enjoy this video and if you did
don't forget to give it a thumbs up for
me so I kind of forgot to film like a
puppet out Tori but thanks so much for
