channel so in today's video I will be
doing this hella inspired look from the
new movie 4 and she's played by Cate
Blanchett which by the way is out in
Australian cinemas October 26 if you'd
like to see how I created this look then
just keep on watching so first up I like
to do my eyebrows and i'm using the
anastasia dipbrow in the shade medium
brown I'm just using a printed cosmetics
eyebrow brush just to fill in my brows
then I'm taking the bond this way can
see light in light by a two-face and I'm
just using that on a concealer brush and
just using that to define above and
below the brows then it's using that
same concealer and just using that as an
eye base and just blending that all over
my eyelids then I'm going in with the
benefit 3d brow tones in the shade
number four and just using that to set
my brows in place then I'm just taking
it the Rimmel stay matte translucent
powder just to set my eyelids in place
just to make sure that the eyeshadow
blends seamlessly then for base I'm
going in with some moisturizer I'm
taking the new glam glow one and just
bring that all over and blending it in
then just smooth out the textured areas
of my face I'm just going in with a
benefit Porefessional just around my
nose and chin area
the foundation I'm using a mixture of
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk in the
shade 5.5 and the it cosmetics CC cream
in the shade light just starting it on
my face first and then just blending it
in the way you're watching me do my
foundation I thought I would speak a
little bit more about the film so for
those that don't already know hella is
actually played by the Australian
actress called Kate Blanchet I'm sure
most of you have already heard of her
before because she's super successful
amazing she's actually one of my
favorite actresses ever I loved watching
her in movies so basically in the movie
she's a creature from a sinister and a
long-forgotten era of the universe and
her power is unlike anything else in the
nine realms I'm not gonna say anything
else because I don't want to spoil the
movie but I'm so excited to go see it
okay now back onto talking about makeup
I'm taking the taut shape type concealer
in the shade light/medium and just
putting that underneath my eyes to
highlight that area and then just
blending it all in with a damp Beauty
Blender then taking the Too Faced Born
This Way translucent powder I'm just
packing that underneath my eyes to set
my concealer in place
then I'm taking the astrologer and full
of space powder in the shade natural
just because I wanted my face to look a
little bit more paler than what it
usually is just because her complexion
wasn't as tan as my skin so I'm just
setting my foundation
then I'm just popping on some blue
contacts from lens issued and then I'm
going on to eyes and using the viola
Voss Pro matte palette taking this warm
sort of orangey shade and just pretty
much placing that everywhere and
blending it into the crease also just
wanted to quickly say when I was doing
the research for this movie I found out
that the majority of the film was
actually filmed in Queensland and I find
that so cool because obviously I'm from
Queensland and that means Chris
Hemsworth was here filming the movie I'm
so excited to watch him in the movie
because obviously he's good-looking and
apparently he's funny in the movie which
makes it ten times better anyways now
I'm grabbing a darker shade of the show
that we just put in is more of like a
coppery color and pretty much placing
that in the same areas as the first
color just deepening it up a bit and
just giving the eyelid a little bit more
definition
now I'm taking a matte black eyeshadow
and pretty much place in that ball over
the mobile lid just packing on the color
and then I go ahead later and blend it
all into the crease
just bear in mind you don't have to be
super neat with this because in the
photo that I used for reference it's
pretty much like all around her eye is
just really smoky and really like
inconsistent like it doesn't have to be
like perfectly blended in a perfectly
like formed circle or whatever runner
eyes so yeah just be mindful of that
you can go pretty crazy on this
then I'm just taking this dark brown
color and just using that to diffuse the
black on the tops and the bottom
and then I'm just doing exactly the same
on the other eye
then I'm taking the Bobby Brown gel
liner in black and just using that to
line my waterline and then I go ahead to
tightline as well
the others taking the balm cosmetics
scuba mascara and just obviously coating
my top and bottom lashes
then I'm just popping on some lashes I
can't remember what style these are but
I'll make sure I find out and leave it
in the description box down below
then taking the Kat Von D shade and
light palette I'm taking the darkest
shade and pretty much just contouring my
face with this just following my natural
contours and I'm kind of like emphasize
them so I've kind of like made a little
fish face and I don't know that's really
hard to explain but you can kind of see
what I'm doing I'm kind of emphasizing
my cheekbones and then just the contours
on at the sides of my mouth
and then taking that same shade again
but I'm mixing a little bit of black
eyeshadow as well and I'm just going
down the sides of my nose just because
in the picture that I was using for
inspo that's kind of what she had so I'm
just kind of yeah following that and
just blending that on either side of my
nose
and then just to bring in a little bit
more dimension into the face I did
decide to go in with a bit of
highlighter so I'm just using the Laura
Geller gilded honey just placing that on
my cheekbones Cupid's bow and down the
bridge of my nose
Philips in the photo she just seemed to
have a dusty nude type natural looking
lip so all I used was this so lip liner
by Mac and just use that all over I
didn't use any lipstick or anything like
that so yeah that is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed watching obviously
I did add a little wig just because
obviously she has black hair and I have
blonde hair but yeah I really really
liked how it turned out and I hope you
guys did too
if you guys end up seeing at the movie
then definitely comment down below I'd
love to hear your thoughts thanks so
much for watching again and I'll see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
