so today's video is going to be a lip
swatch video of all of the new two-faced
hunt
melted liquid lipsticks by the way
before I start I'm wearing a cool girl
liquid lipstick with a lip injection
gloss over the top I cover what the
color is but I'll leave it down below if
you guys that are wondering so as most
of you guys probably already know I went
to a two-faced event in it Sydney and it
was so amazing I met so many amazing
youtubers and it also met some of the
managers from two days that flew all the
way from America so I'm so blessed to
have met them everyone that was at the
dinner received two bags well this is
actually just one because I tried to fit
it all in one two bags full of two-faced
makeup and I was just like when she
first pulled out the bags she said this
is just an opportunity for you guys to
play around the products level bus watch
them or whatever so I just thought it
was just for us to share and the table
that night just watch a few product but
actually we could take some home and I'm
so so so grateful that I actually got
the opportunity to even go to the event
so yeah I thought I would do like a
little quick haul at the start just to
show you guys what I got and then
towards the end of the video I'll do a
lip swatch of all of the colors so I
hope you guys enjoy watching and I'm
just going to get straight ahead and get
onto the hall okay so I'm just going to
go ahead and just whip out everything in
their groups instead of showing you one
by one just because otherwise this will
go for hours so basically I got all of
the Born This Way concealers and I'm
actually wearing light underneath my
eyes and the coverage is amazing I'm so
happy that they put these in there
because apparently we're the only
Aussies that actually have these
products so how cool is that and they
gave us the better than sex mascara and
the waterproof better than sex mascara
next up I got the Too Faced lip
injection
it and the one that I'm wearing is
actually in the bathroom but it's the
lightest shade doesn't really come off
like really light it kind of just blend
it in with my liquid lipstick but I got
five of these which look amazing and
then I got this bronzer and blush this
one is called the perfect flush blush
which looks like this super nice and
shimmery and then the bate luminous glow
bronzer I don't think these ones are new
but I've never actually owned these so
I'm so glad to finally have them in my
kit and then their brow gel so this is
called brow quickie brush on fiber cream
and it just comes in a lighter and
darker shade I haven't actually tried
these but I'm really really excited too
and then I got the mascara melt off so
apparently you brush these on your
lashes before you take off your mascara
and it just makes it a little bit easier
to remove yeah I'm going to try that out
now like when I take my makeup off and
then lastly I got all of the sketch
markers and the application tip on this
is amazing I'll show you
so it just kind of reminds me of the
Maybelline hyper sharp it's like a felt
tip liner it just looks amazing I think
you get one of these with the new
nikkietutorials and Too Faced collab I'm
pretty sure she said that you get one of
these but yeah so that is what they look
like amazing I can't wait to use them so
yeah there's everything that I got in a
goodie bags from the true paper bed so
now I'm going to go ahead and swatch all
16 of the Too Faced melted matte liquid
lipsticks so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and if you do don't forget to give
a thumbs up for me and I'll see you in
my next video
