channel so today's video is going to be
of this makeup look that you've probably
seen on Instagram I actually refilmed it
because I wasn't really a hundred
percent happy with the audio I don't
know what it is with my old mic but it
made like a hissing sound when I wasn't
speaking when I was recording so I got
this new one so hopefully the sound is
way way way better anyways I filmed with
the new two-faced sweet peach palette
and oh my god not gonna lie I don't
think it smells like peaches it smells
like some sort of lolly but I can't I
can't put my finger on it maybe like
peach lollies or something but not an
actual you know peach but well it still
smells amazing these are all the colors
so yeah if you would like to see how I
created this look then keep on watching
so first up I'm going in with candid
peach and I'm just putting that in my
crease oh this part is stunning you're
gonna have to be super neat with this
cuz we're gonna be putting colors below
it then I'm just gonna take a flat
shader brush and spray it with that NYX
setting spray again and I'm gonna go in
with lucious which just looks freakin
luscious looks amazing and just place
that all over my lid oh yes I love this
color so much
obsessed
so now I'm going to go in with summer
YUM which is probably my favorite color
and I'm just going to use that in my
crease just to create a little bit more
depth and dimension because that Carly
color is pretty light and I really want
my crease to stand out
so now I'm gonna grab tempting which is
the darkest color in the palette and
this place that on the outer corners
only oh this is really hard to blend
this color can you see that maybe it's
something in the formula of this
eyeshadow because all of them looks
smooth but this one looks really like
bumpy it's maybe that's why it's not
blending as well I don't know if you can
see but it's not blending as well as the
other colors all my other like dark
colors and my other palettes oh my god
it's actually not blending blend which
it's so much fallout is happening right
now what is happening it's alright we'll
save it this part is a bit of a disaster
to be honest I'm taking some YUM
to try and diffuse that color will help
diffuse and it seems to be working I'm
taking luscious and just putting more on
my lid because we lost so that color in
that blending so now I'm taking my
favorite gel liner which is the
Maybelline eye studio and I'm gonna put
that in my waterline
so now I'm gonna take some YUM and use
that to smoke out the lower lashline
then taking candid peach and just mixing
that in with this summer YUM so this is
just a clean blending brush I'm just
using that to blend everything together
now taking what is nectar
I'm patting that in my inner corner
because I really want that to be bright
and then also putting that in the inner
corners whoa that's so nice and then of
course on my brow bone so for lashes I'm
gonna go in with the billion lashes in
the style and Nicki which looks like
this super cute and is going to apply
that off-camera and then I'll be back in
a second I'm just adding some mascara on
my bottom lashes I'm just using the
Tarte one
so the lips I'm going to use the Kylie
cosmetics 22 liquid lipstick so I'm
going to go in with the matching lip
liner
then I'm going to go in with the 22
matching liquid lipstick
and then I'm going to go in with this
mac lipglass in the shade floor
abundance which by the way a company a
clothing company sent to me along with
some clothes so thank you so much hello
Bazaar I love this color so this is the
finished look
actually no it's not because I'm going
to spray my face of this NYX Julie
finish setting spray now it's finished I
hope you guys enjoyed watching if you
did don't forget to give it a thumbs up
for me and comment down below what you
would like to see next on my channel and
I guess I'll see you in my next video
