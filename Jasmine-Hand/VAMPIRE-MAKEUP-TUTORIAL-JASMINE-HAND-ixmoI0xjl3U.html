going to get straight into it so I'm
just grabbing creme brulee on a large
fluffy brush and putting that into my
crease and then I'm grabbing and need
them up from the milk cosmetics Dark
Matter stack is just a really rich ready
brown shade and I'm also running that in
my crease and as you can see I'm
building up the intensity and then I'm
going in with a red this is from the my
beauty marks cosmetics palette is just a
random hell that I got sent ages ago and
as you can see I'm just putting that a
little bit above my crease and then
blending it out with a massive blending
brush and then I'm going in with dark
but i'm pretty sure it's just a matte
black eyeshadow also from the milk
cosmetics stack and I'm just placing
that on my lid and then I'm placing a
dark brown eyeshadow this one is from
the line from Venice palette and just
blending everything out together
and then I'm lining my waterline
smudging that out and then using the
enigma shade and also blending my art as
well
and then I'm just putting on some
mascara and then falsies i'm using the
house of lashes iconix and they are at
the moment my favorite lashes of all
time I wear them every single time I
wear my makeup now I just think they are
incredible okay so what I use to draw
the veins underneath the eyes is the
matte red eyeshadow that I used in the
crease not enigma the other bright red
and I'm just using that on a angold
eyebrow brush I think this one's from
Pony cosmetics and as you can see i'm
very very lightly applying this in a
zigzag motion down my face vertically
and then i'm going in with the matte
black and it is so hard to make these
look faint so what I did as I was doing
was blending it out with a clean
blending brush just so it didn't look so
harsh and then I went over it with my
Beauty Blender so it just looked nice
and soft and a little bit more realistic
and on my lips I used the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in a trust
issues is seriously the most amazing
color ever
and to finish off the look I'm putting
some fake blood that i got from stacks
or crazy clarks i'm pretty sure and it
was only two dollars and as you can see
i'm just putting it directly underneath
my mouth to give the illusion that i
just ate someone or something but yeah I
think it kind of looks cool
and there you have it guys thank you
guys so much for watching don't forget
to give this video a massive thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and I hope you got
some inspo for Halloween and i'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
