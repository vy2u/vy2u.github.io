to my channel so today I decided to vlog
because I've got some exciting things
happening today so I was like me as well
without my vlog camera and vlog it so
today I think I might be going to the
Sephora launch on the Gold Coast at
Pacific fair so I thought I would show
you guys around and I'm also going and
getting my eyebrows retouched by Sabina
again
I wish I vlogged my first experience
with her like getting them done for the
first time because I think that would
have been an amazing vlog but yeah I
thought I would take you along to show
you guys the process of what happens
when you get I brought a tude it's
seriously not as bad as everyone thinks
it's seriously so pain free and so worth
it actually so excited to go see her I
haven't seen her in ages I usually go
and see when I go get my lips done every
now and again because it's next door
from cosmetic Center okay so don't mind
my skin but I just recently got my
eyebrows threaded let me see if I can
get a spoolie so I can show you how much
it's faded like I don't need to get them
retouch but I want to okay I'm going to
show you now just with a cotton pad if
it focuses okay so if you can kind of
see it's kind of faded underneath my
hair so I just kind of want that bit
retouched and I think over time
I always pluck the hair underneath AI
think I pluck this one too much because
they're different shapes like this one's
a little bit thinner I think I want to
get this one tattooed a little bit
thicker here because yeah I've just over
plucked it but that is why I'm getting
them retouched by the way I've been
playing this new app called best fiends
and it's actually really fun I'll show
you now so this is the app so basically
best fiends is a puzzle game with tons
of characters you can collect and build
a team in order to defeat the slugs so
as you can see in the top left hand
corner
they are your goals for the level so you
have to defeat the slug six times get
two boxes and five diamonds I want level
30 and I'm really stuck on this level so
basically all you do
is just match the same colored objects
together you can go up down and diagonal
as well each of the colors represent a
certain character at the top which you
can build stronger and then they give
you like bonus things throughout the
game give you more of an advantage to
win the level you can download this game
for free I'll leave it in the
description box down below I got the new
vanish seamless foundation stick by
hourglass and this is what the packaging
looks like OOP it's upside down oh my
god
look at my fake tan that always happens
on that finger so that's what the
packaging looks like and it also comes
with a brush I don't think the actual
foundation comes with a brush but they
sent me the brush as well it's really
really dense and soft so I'll probably
actually apply this in this vlog and let
you guys know what I think about it oh
these are the foundation sticks up close
this one is in the shade warm beige and
then this one would sweep my tan the
best and then this middle one is called
if it's going to focus nude and then
this one is shell I'm pretty sure yeah
so these are the colors I'll swatch them
on my hand so you guys can see the
coverage it's amazing just kind of semi
blended out and yes it's really full
coverage I'm so excited because the
other hourglass foundation that I tried
I think it was called like the luminous
finish one yeah it just was not full
coverage at all and I hated it so yeah
I'm so excited to try these ones out
how's that for dedication Priceline had
like a 50% off Australis sale so I
picked up a fuckload of my favorite
powder and I also picked up this
actually I'm going to try this today so
I'm going to put it over here my makeup
room is such a mess I like too
embarrassed to show you guys so that's
like my vanity where I used to do my
makeup but now I'll show you what it
looks like so I have like my backdrop
there which I'm trying to improve I
don't know I just don't really like the
lighting in my videos lately just a
bunch of on the floor and then like
I just have my two umbrella lights which
I might replace with my soft boxes so I
think I like the lighting with those
better then my tripod where I put my
camera and then yeah
the current situation so I just finished
my makeup this is what it looks like
well my lips just looked huge just then
these earrings are from hello Bazar this
long sort of cardigan is from whitefox
boutique and I think this singlet sort
of top is from Big W okay my something
like that but yeah and I've just got
black jeans on so I'm about to head to
Sephora now and then I'm going to Sabina
to get my eyebrows touched up so I guess
you guys are coming with me
by
the line was just too long so it didn't
want to wait that long
we're just going to go shopping now in
public
oh my god my embarrassing you yep yeah
actually my life struggle constantly out
of stock
yes
oh my god there's me oh my god
please look at that oh my god
it's funny look at my face in the camera
though that was my first treatment
that's so funny
brother Shannon shinik so before after
so I've just got the numbing cream on
super sexy
lion roaring in the Morning Sun such a
formal longer day people feeling like
the light has just come we must never
stop
let this happen
hey guys so it has now been four days
since the treatment so I thought I would
give you guys a look at my brows if it
wants to focus so they are what web
browsers are looking like now they're
starting to scab which is normal starts
to scab two to three days after and
that's when they're the darkest so
they're just starting to lighten up a
bit now like as you can see it's like
scab there so when it all finishes
scabbing it'll be much lighter so I
thought I would share some points of
aftercare of eyebrow tattoos so it says
that please be aware after your trim
that your brows will be darker
particularly on day two two three so two
days ago they were probably the darkest
and now they're starting to lighten up
because they're scabbing over the next
one two weeks they will settle with the
true color developing by week four to
six so you'll need to add a thin layer
of the panthan on your brows twice a day
for the next two weeks so basically this
just helps for healing and color
retention so it says the best results
keep your brows waterproof in the shower
for seven days after treatment two weeks
for salt water and chlorine so what's
the manor told me to do is just to put a
thick layer of Vaseline when I wanted to
wash my hair but still be mindful of
water going straight onto the brow so
like I always tilt my head all the way
back so the waters not actually touching
it because I have oily skin the ink may
or may not move so in the healing
process
last time I got my eyebrows tattooed
well for the first time those are just a
few strokes that kind of wore away
because my skin so oily so at the
retouch she just fix them up and they
were all good so I thought I would add a
little Q&amp;amp;A segment to the end of the
video just for you guys I read on one of
my Instagram posts that you would want
to see one so one of my most asked
questions is does it hurt
it it's definitely not the most
comfortable feeling but it's definitely
bearable probably like 3 out of 10 I'm
the biggest with pain so if you
can take pain you probably wouldn't feel
it but yeah I don't actually have a
normal tattoo so I couldn't compare it
so I've got my ears pierced my trade is
pierced and my belly pierced and I would
say they definitely hurt way more than
the eyebrow so that's something to
compare it to so someone asked how do
they do your brows and I actually was
really intrigued as well because I
thought that she just used like a really
thin blade and that's how she created
the micro strokes but in fact she
actually uses like a really tiny needle
but within that tiny needle there's like
10 other little branches of needles so
it's like really really fine it's so
cool though so she doesn't use a machine
or anything it's just all like freehand
and yeah she just draws the strokes on
to open the skin and then she puts the
ink in so yeah someone else asked how
long was the whole process of getting
your brows done so you first go in there
they numb you up because I think you
have to wait at least 20 minutes for it
to work and then you go in there to have
a consultation with Sabina you go
through some photos you tell her what
kind of shape and color you're looking
for then she goes in and draws what it's
going to look like with a pencil which I
showed you in the vlog and once you're
happy with that that's it then she
starts to get straight into the
treatment my first treatment took around
an hour and a half just because I had no
shape to my brow so she had to basically
do a whole new shape for me so obviously
that would um last a bit longer I think
she allows I don't know maybe two hours
per person for like the consultation and
stuff I think they're like the main
questions that mostly everyone's asking
so I don't think I'm going to answer any
more but I hope you guys enjoyed this
little vlog and if you did don't forget
to give it a thumbs up and let me know
if you want me to film more of these
because they're really fun to film and
I'd love to upload more vlogs on my
channel rather than just having them all
makeup tutorials so yeah and also don't
forget to check out Sabina I'll leave
