so I thought for today's video I'm gonna
do a weekly vlog because one I've never
done them before and I really love
blogging so I thought I'm gonna vlog
everything that I do this week I've got
heaps of appointments on so yeah I just
thought it'd be like a busy vlog plus I
am actually off to Sydney this weekend
for a princess Polly and benefit event
so I thought I'd bring you guys along
with me to that as well because it
sounds like a lot of fun this morning I
went to f45
at 7 a.m. I usually don't go in the
morning it feels like I've been awake
for so long because usually like I get
up around this time like 9:30 so yeah I
feel like I know if it feels like 1:00
p.m. but it's not I'm off to do my
grocery shopping for the wait I'm still
doing the f45 meal plan so I'll be
shopping for that I will try I've loved
as much as I can when I'm in there but
I'm really bad at public vlogging yeah
yes embarrass so if I don't then that's
probably why
Merry Christmas but I have so far
brought oats apple cider vinegar holy
meat better mother sauce and spread so
good coconut flakes and just going
through the meal plan and yeah buying
from the menu
hey guys so I just got back from the
shops and I'm going to make these
coconut protein cookies I made them last
challenge and they're actually alright
they taste a bit bland but yeah I'm just
gonna make them for you guys so when I
need like alright cool
and it's something like taller I'm just
gonna mix it all in this massive bowl
combine the rolled oats raspberries
desiccated coconut and protein powder in
a large bowl though these are my rolled
oats so I'm just going to take one cup
and then just like pop I guess
alright so now I'm gonna add the
desiccated coconut it says 1/3 of a cup
so I'm just gonna add to 1/3 of a cup
one two that says three tablespoons of
protein powder I'm just gonna use maybe
two of these
so I only need two tablespoons it says
potion of mixer - but I'm going to put
four in because I'm making two batches
and then I need two teaspoons sorry if
that was loud
true tablespoons of coconut syrup but
I'm just gonna use rice mild hope that's
alright
so I'm just going to put four
tablespoons in holy this looks so
disgusting crack the egg into a separate
bowl and use a force to whisk okay if
you insist on me having unnecessary
dishes just whisking egg whites no
reason I'm gonna add this into the dry
mixture the two egg whites
oh my god yeah my hands are gonna be so
gross after this I don't I taste it
yah doesn't taste as good in the smell
so I've just put the cookie mixture on
truth some baking paper on a baking tray
I'm gonna pop them in the oven for 15
minutes and show you guys what they look
like when they're done YUM they're done
they look black but oh cool gonna take
these out they look so good I'll try one
later okay moment of truth
I'm gonna try these
yeah okay
a bit dry but this time tastes like cod
porridge but hogs of the porridge
not bad so I literally just picked up a
heap of stuff from princess Holly
because I'm off to Bali oh my god I'm
gonna try some of these on and show you
guys but all this stuff looks so cute
oh my god dad I actually still have my
discount code I'm pretty sure it's JH 20
and you get 20% off but I'll leave
everything down below oh my god how cute
is this jumpsuit I am obsessed
leave the links below to everything that
I try on but oh my gosh I love this how
cute is this top I'm obsessed with this
mustardy sort of color and I also got
these pants I think they're a little bit
too big they are a medium and I probably
wouldn't have fit a small but they're
like just relaxed sort of like comfy
shorts I really like them just for like
around the house or yeah I just think it
would be perfect in Bali because I
really like thin as well but this top
though also makes my titties look big
even though they're not I got this skirt
but I think it is a little bit too big
and because denim stretches I think when
I have to take this back and ask for a
smaller size I think this one is a size
12 so probably need a size 10 but yeah
it's like really cute and relaxed I'm
obsessed and I love a brands like their
clothes are amazing okay so this white
place suit is actually amazing oh my god
I'm obsessed love hey guys is that so
I'm on my way true Australian skin
clinics I'm getting my laser treatment
and I'm also getting micro dermabrasion
as well
I thought I would bring you guys alone
and log
literally highly yeah I will see you
guys when I get there
hey guys so it's now Tuesday I didn't
really get up too much after my micro
and laser treatments yesterday so I just
decided not to vlog for the rest of the
day but this morning I went to a few
doctor's appointments and then went and
visited my grandma and then I just went
true pick up some pear box mail so I'll
open up with you guys oh oh
BH Cosmetics oh wow nothing oh cool
that's what the power looks like I might
have to do it tutorial with it oh my god
it's so pretty
that's what the colors are clack I'll do
a little swatch on one this gold looks
amazing dad this one too eh cosmetic oh
yeah
this is their nine piece brush set but
this is a eyeshadow palette I think oh
so nice like the perfect everyday in
neutral colors Oh cute and then they
have like more colors at the top okay I
have one last little parcel it's really
light
oh my god oh my god mini Beautyblender
this so cute I'm gonna like wet one cuz
they're like so tiny would be the best
for concealer I concealing and baking
underneath the eyes by the brand dirty
30s by the way this is as big as it's
going to expand after wetting it with
water whereas this is my normal Beauty
Blender not expanded so this goes like
probably a little bit bigger than
there's actually quite a lot so yeah
this is like a small little one that's
so cute and I can like fake the contour
with the side don't think I have to try
these out but thank you so much for
those sponges I will definitely use them
hey guys
so I'm on my way to do another cryo
stash an ice chamber that goes down to
minus 100 degrees and you're in there
for three minutes it helps with like
muscle recovery
so yeah I'm gonna take you guys along
I'm almost here burns up to 800 calories
all right let's do this
hi
I'm here with Alex and we're about to do
it at 45 - and they're gonna film some
of that so you guys can say it all
how long we've been out there and these
nights I can't sing shut up like a bad
night gee I'll conquer in my soul this
is real
getting short
so I just finished a 45 that was a tough
one today but I love the white sessions
like hey doll aircon thankful laughs I'm
starving
hey guys so I know this is really ran
and bought a girl on Instagram messaged
me the other day and she was like hey
where was your mattress from that you
got because she saw on my snapchat or
whatever that I got a mattress and it
came in a box so my mattress is from
opale and it's just an online brand and
yeah it does come in a box this is
literally the softest mattress I've ever
slept on ever like I've only had one of
the mattress in my life and that was
when I was a child but ever since I
moved out I got this one and it is so
called because it actually has two
different sort of like comfort settings
I don't know this is what it looks like
from the inside so it's sponge you can
flip this over and this is actually the
more firmer side I like a firm sort of
mattress so you can actually flip this
bit over and it's softer but I don't
like you know like seeping into a bed
I'd rather a firm mattress so yeah I
just thought I would quickly mention
that because yeah a couple of you guys
have asked me where I got it from I'll
leave all of their website links down
below for you guys if you want to check
them out so I've just made my bed so for
those asking my bed frame is from Harvey
Norman and I always get my bed sheets
from is it bed bath and table yeah I'm
pretty sure it's bed bath and table but
it's Morgan and Finch I always buy
Morgan and Finch and then my pillows are
just from came out I think but yeah for
those that are wondering just thought I
would a give him a quick shout out so
