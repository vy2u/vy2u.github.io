welcome back to another weekly vlog so I
planned on filming like when I was in
pause but I just didn't happen
thought I was gonna film because my
boyfriend was planning on what I think
about he actually didn't have that much
work when I got over there so we just
ended up spending time together and I
didn't really like they'd do anything
exciting for beautiful hey guys so I'm
literally just filmed my p.o box opening
and this is the aftermath so now I'm
gonna go and run all of this shit down
through the bins it's we're gonna take
me like five loads but yeah and then I'm
probably gonna go and edit my video that
I just filmed which I'm hoping should be
up tomorrow and then I think I'm gonna
go to F 45 tonight I literally haven't
been to the gym in like three weeks
sorry not sorry
good morning guys hey I didn't really
blog that much yesterday cuz to be
honest I didn't really get up too much
but I went to F 45 at night like the
first time in like four weeks and pretty
much died but other than that today I'm
going through Australian skin clinics
and getting a microdermabrasion and my
laser so I'll take you guys along with
me for that we're just about to go to
the gym in my apartment block it's
nothing flash but yeah yeah
literally like there's already like
three machines but oh that's recording
is this yeah I need to focus hun guys
calm out that is sorry dodgy that's a
bit better I'm off to Australian skin
clinics I'm getting a microdermabrasion
or appeal and I'm also getting I'm only
getting laser or cryotherapy attack I
remember which one I'm booked in for but
I'll try and log as much as I can
especially the cryo got heaps of
questions last time about it on my
Instagram so it's basically the fat
freezer so I get two paddles on my
stomach abili
ever had true treatments so I'm you need
about like I don't know five to six to
see results but apparently it's supposed
to take away 20% of fat on the areas
that you train to be honest I haven't
really been able to see a like visual
difference in my stomach since having
the treatment yeah maybe I will see your
change after this treatment or maybe
even the next one yeah I thought I would
just keep you guys updated because it is
quite an expensive treatment and
obviously if it doesn't work or if it
doesn't work on me I wouldn't recommend
it but yeah I'm keen to see if I can see
results but apparently it does take a
while it's not just something that
happens instantly like after the
treatment so yes
so I'm having the mandelic peel my skin
like so red and I'm just about to have
cried every I'm not having lazy to say
I'm having that next week so I'll try
and look as much as I can for that it's
a fat phrasing
yeah
hey guys I just finished off an
Australian skin clinics
I got a mandelic peels in my face is
like super red at the moment and I got
Cryer
it's so weird when they like take the
paddles off yeah it just makes like your
stomach feel really weird but it's
definitely not painful for those that
have asked me before also something very
exciting that I just want to picked up I
think I might be doing other Contiki
tour but in America so me and Peter I
really want to go to the USA in Canada
like over the new year and our birthdays
because our birthdays are like quite
close he's is in the end of December and
mine's in the side of January so we're
hoping to be traveling over those dates
and I really want to do a speech they
want to do New Year's in New York for
like the ball drop I think that would be
amazing and I've never really like been
to a place with heaps of snow like I
have I've been to Switzerland in winter
in Europe I've never been to a city that
has snowed well the Sun so yeah that
should be pretty exciting I'm just gonna
go through the book I just find it so
much easier to like have a look with
like a hardcopy book in front of me then
like the laptop you guys have any
suggestions on where to go what to see I
definitely want to go to like New York
he's ever been to America so he wants to
go to like LA and stuff I've been but
when I was younger Vegas obviously he
wants to be in Vegas for his birthday so
someone is watching me so I'm going to
end the vlog now morning happy of
Wednesday well
touching on morning it's afternoon did
have a little bit of a cheeky sleep in
today because I've been so tired I've
been going about so late so yeah I've
been getting up a little bit later than
usual but I'm often going up my hair
done at last I roll ah it's been about
eight weeks since I got soils so I'm
just going to get like obviously just a
touch up with blonde and yeah I've also
decided that I'm starting the new keto
diet for those of you that don't know
what the keto diet is is basically a low
carb and high fat diet
I had the lighting isn't on but I'll it
should just spend like pretty much like
all day watching videos for like
beginners on the diet so I officially
started the diet today oh my god I'm so
sorry for the lighting the Sun is like
beaming I'm see I officially started the
diet today so if a breakfast I had
scrambled eggs with avocado and spinach
and then I didn't really get around true
because I don't really have that much
food like I need to go shopping to buy
the food so I'm gonna go shopping after
this and get some like high fat foods
like butter and cheese and stuff that I
don't have tomorrow and yeah hopefully
this is going to help my body shift some
more weight because I feel like I don't
know this past year I've been the same
like I haven't lost anything I haven't
gained anything it's just been like like
my body's like reached a plateau I don't
know how I'm gonna go with not having
carbs because carbs are live but I don't
really have them that often
like obviously when I go out like I'll
have like eggs on toast if I'm going out
for brekkie or something like that or
like I can't really have like sandwiches
anymore
apparently it's only limited to about 20
grams of carbs per day which isn't a lot
because there's pretty much carbs in
everything so as long as you don't
exceed the 20 grams of carbs you should
the on the right track good morning guys
it is Wednesday today as you know I am
starting my keto diet and of course I
forgot to fill my breakfast but
basically what I had was two classes of
bacon two eggs scrambled I put in a
little bit of spinach and then some
cheese on top like when it was almost
cooked and that was so good I think I
overcooked the bacon though I'll put a
reminder on my phone to film my
breakfast and like what I ate tomorrow
for you guys I'm glad to hear making a
separate video on that so if you got
something to say like and what I eat in
a day on this keto diet let me know how
probably won't do it for another like
week or so just because I want to slight
try and like practice making the meals
and like getting used to it so I can
like perfect it and then I'll film it
because like right now it's kind of like
trial and error trying to like make
meals to fit in with my macros and stuff
which I'm only just like sort of getting
I just use like MyFitnessPal to like
track everything so yeah today yesterday
I want to get my hair done this is what
it looks like she just kind of did my
regrowth amazing as always they're going
to love Sorella and their atropine are
they've been doing my hair for about
three years now oh by the way I'm having
a coffee I'm just having I'm milk and a
shot of coffee and some is it stevia or
whatever the sweetener is um thank God
we can have almond milk because I love
almond it looks like I'm obsessed and I
love my coffee I'm just kind of like
chilling out kicking back I feel like I
need like a week break after I get back
from someone I know that sounds crazy
because it was like in Australia but
still yeah I think I might film a video
today I'm not sure what one but yet I'll
continue to take you guys along with me
hey lovely people so I feel like I'm
like vlogging in my co-pilot pretty much
every time I'm gonna cut dry my skin
looks here I just did a lip swatch video
and my skin has been so dry since my
peel at Australia's getting clinics but
that's fine like it's normal I'm off to
get my hair colour match because I'm
getting extensions tomorrow so I'm just
gonna go like stop by so they can see
like what colors they have if they need
to dye it before tomorrow if the
extensions I mean to match like my hair
color so I'm so excited so yeah I'm off
doing it now and then I'm gonna go pick
up grace and then we're gonna go shoot I
think I'm gonna be doing much like later
on so if I don't speak to you guys later
then I will speak to you guys tomorrow
I just finished shooting with grace we
went to Sovereign Island and found a
really cute white house and like
literally just posed in front of their
agents even though it was like someone's
ass
so yeah we did that
yeah we just went to like a few other
key places around suffering if you guys
don't know like what southern island is
like on the Gold Coast attacked by all
the rich houses are like it was amazing
so I'm off to go home and make dinner
because I'm starving like the other
thing ever had all day is my breakfast
which was bacon and eggs but I haven't
really like felt hungry until now and
it's five o'clock so I'm thinking I
might make a chicken Caesar salad
without the dressing of course and I
just using my hell instead so I'm so
excited for that cuz I'm literally
obsessed with like chicken Caesar salad
good morning beautiful people so I'm off
to get my hair extensions today my
hesitant wet I literally it was like
rushing out the door this morning
but yeah I'm super excited I'm going to
Emily hydral hair extensions in Broad
Beach pretty sure she has a few shops
like in Brisbane
and I'm pretty sure I've heard amazing
things about their extensions and just
how they're applied so I'm getting the
invisible tape extensions so they will
be semi-permanent I just feel like the
last year I've lost a lot of volume in
my hair and there's nothing I want more
than sick hair it just makes me feel so
like confident and feminine but I don't
know apparently I was talking to my
hairdresser the other day and she said
like the reason why your heads but we
think that is not because it's blonde
because she said my hair is actually
really healthy but because obviously the
last like a year or so I've been letting
regularly exercising and it's really bad
to have your hair up when your hair's
wet so like the sweat and stuff I tend
to tie my hair up when I go to bed
apparently that
just all these things that she was
saying that I was doing which then
contributes to like my hair falling out
and all that stuff I just really put my
big hair so that's why I decided to get
extensions I'll try and film everything
in the salad so you guys can see like
exactly what extensions I get what color
I get and just how they're applied so
yeah I'm super excited so I'll see you
when I'm inside just about to walking
oh my god you guys I just got my hair
done I haven't felt this fool
lack of hair on the Sun in ages hey guys
so I'm just about to go to cause Medi
center and get my lips touched up it's
probably been about a year and a half
since I got them done so I'm just gonna
go and get I deserve that for laughing
at her anyways oh god I need help so if
you guys hate needles and probably skip
these next couple minutes cuz yeah just
you know
so you're just thinking
she's not punking me or anything so she
must be okay I thought this is actual
now this is the numbing cream like the
numbing and just numbs your whole face
you don't feel the actual needles yeah
go in every time so many people would
never go back and get do it's done again
simply because it's so bloody painful
yeah all right lovely any stretch now
you'll feel this little scratch and then
nothing scratch
okay I'm gonna scratch
see you and roll me that
but how long did that last for it will
be about three to four months but when
you get your lips filled in so much
better
hey guys so I just got my lips touched
up my face feels so no like and don't
want the flakiness of my face it's from
my peel from Australian skin clinics but
surely put in point six of a mil I
didn't really want that like much I just
wanted like the borders just a little
bit more enhance and then just the
bottom I honestly couldn't recommend
cosmides Center asked for senior she's
like amazing I mean you can just tell
someone knows what they're doing and
like really passionate about like their
job like you can just tell that she
knows exactly what to do like what would
suit your face the right size for your
face and like lips to start off with
she's amazing I've gotten so many
friends on to her yeah I just feel so
comfortable around her I wouldn't go
anywhere else I hope you guys are
enjoying the vlog so far I thought I
wasn't doing much this week and then I
realized when I got all these
appointment confirmations I was like oh
shit I actually do have a lot on but
yeah I will speak to you guys very soon
just pinch my pillow box so I thought I
would open some parcels up for you guys
so the first parcel I received a very
open zip it's been closed from ember
Crombie and Fitch Abercrombie I'm
obsessed brand so it's so excited when
they reach out to me so that's cool
clothes and then I got this Fenty beauty
package there's so many people walking
around like my god which is just like in
the middle of it shoppings in a car park
um oh my god okay so they knew foil
freestyle highlighted yours that's what
it looks like that's so pretty
don't know if I would wear it as a
highlighter but I reckon I could wear
this as eyeshadow for sure let's do a
swatch oh my god they're so buttery Wow
show you my hand got a little flap here
that flaps open and it has their primer
and foundation and a blotting powder I
haven't actually tried their foundation
yet I'm super excited to though blotting
powder what is this like micro like at
home that is so cool I'm gonna have to
read about that tonight and see how that
works a lip plumping system I'm sure my
friend Vic would be came to try that out
collagen infusing facial masks and
finally the smart facial cleansing
device does I'm gonna have to read up on
these um products
I'm off to Cole's now to get some
ingredients for dinner and yeah probably
make it like as soon as I get home cuz
I'm starving it's like 4:30 but I
haven't had lunch so that's probably why
so yeah I'll see you when I get home
here's my attempt of making tacos I
tried to like I don't know why these
didn't go hard like this ones like semi
hard but they're like floppy so then I
just decided to make a taco Bowl I just
have faith mints lettuce tomato sour
cream and then these is like the chased
taco shells YUM happy Saturday guys so
I'm off to the food was cold for a
second this salad to do a client I'm
actually doing a bride today but I think
it's a pretty small wedding so she's
coming to me and I'm only doing the
bride's so I've got that and then I'm
just gonna do some filming in the salon
with a model and then I've got another
client as well like in the afternoon so
little update on my lips so she uses a
product called a Merville which is like
a non swelling and non bruising product
so basically what you see is what you
get like straight
after it will go down a little bit like
they are a little bit inflamed because
my lips like always look bigger in the
morning for some reason I'm really happy
with it
also my hair is literally so amazing
like I didn't have to do anything with
it this morning I just took it out of
its low ponytail and I'm good to go
try and do some like up styles and like
ponytails and show you guys how you can
style hair with extensions as well like
when you go to the gym and stuff because
when you tie them up you still can't see
the tapes which is what I was mostly
worried about before I went in was being
able to see the tapes when I tied my
hair up but you definitely can't I tried
it last night
I even tried putting it up in a high
pony still no tapes visible which is
amazing so yeah I'll keep you guys
updated on like how I maintain the hair
how it's going if it's annoying me which
you probably won't so yeah
happy Sunday everyone so yesterday I
didn't really get up too much after I
finished at work so I had a client in
the morning and then I filmed a model
for a makeup tutorial and then I had
another client in the afternoon and then
last night I just showed with my friend
week and I like just went out for dinner
and had grilled and I had a zucchini
noodle and she can that salad and it was
amazing
yeah later when I want to try that new
PMD like vibrating facial cleansing
brush cuz I feel like my skin needs it
my hair is still amazing as normal it
was just a little bit oily at the roots
so I just put a bit of dry shampoo but I
still haven't washed it since I got it
done three days ago
and it still looks super fresh and
amazing and I'm honestly it's so
obsessed with it like I don't even know
why I didn't get extensions so in our
life honestly
but yeah I'm off to the shops now so I
will talk to you guys later hey guys so
I literally just got back from Kmart
it's about five o'clock I think and I
got one of these it's just like a wooden
plaything rack just for this corner of
my room because there is not enough room
in my wardrobe because I'm a hoarder of
clothes and I just needed some extra
like clothing room and it's kind of like
good because when I get new clothes I
can just hang up here instead of like
putting them in this little tub which is
what I've been doing and I've just been
forgetting that I've got new clothes so
yeah you know how I got this in my pair
box so today I'm gonna give it a go so
it is the PMD a clean smart facial
cleansing device I read a little bit
about what it does to skin on the back
for those wondering I'm so basically
it's a sonic glow technology with 7000
vibrations per minute it removes skins
impurities by breaking down down oil
within the pores it has a silicone top
it is water-resistant
so you can use it in the shower and the
brush head never needs replacing it just
needs washing so you can just wash it
with soap you can also like massage your
moisturizer and with it as well as
cleanser and there's no cord or
recharging it's all battery operated so
I'm gonna give it a go
I've already put the battery like you
know before this is basically what it
looks like and then you put the battery
in here so it comes out and it comes
with the battery and then you just turn
this on and you can feel it vibrating oh
my god and then you can also use this
side as well to like massage products
into the skin so well and you can also
adjust the like level of vibration so
the first click is just this you
probably hear it and then the second
click is faster and then the third is
like pulsating vibrations so I'm going
to use my ultra sweet equals cleanser
this is just that ultra balancing gel
cleanser
just massage it into the skin first then
I'm going to get this where it
underneath the tap and then I'll just
start in the first inning oh my god that
feels so good and just massage it like
in each section for about 30 seconds my
skin is so red now I'm just going to get
some of my moisturizer and pop it on and
use the other side of it and use that to
massage into my face oh my god this was
so but as well I feel like when my skin
goes red after doing a skincare routine
I feel like it's doing something like my
skin is just feel so like soft oh my god
so yeah if you guys are interested in
trying one of those brushes out I will
link everything else down below as well
as my discount code for you guys so I'm
gonna go and go to mums for dinner
mom's boyfriend actually is doing the
keto diet as well so just gonna cook a
nice keto meal so I'll go and vlog
whatever she makes I think she's making
lamb chops and like salad I think hi
guys it's just me and my messy burr and
when I was guilted this but I'm back
home now I forgot to bring my vlog
camera to moms but yeah we had like lamb
chops with like roasted vegetables and a
salad it was so so good so yeah I hope
