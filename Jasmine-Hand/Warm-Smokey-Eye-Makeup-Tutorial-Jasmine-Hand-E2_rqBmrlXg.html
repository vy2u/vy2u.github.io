sorry if my microphone sounds a little
bit off but I couldn't like figure out
how to plug in my normal one that I use
when I'm actually in Brussels at the
moment in Belgium so yeah I have a
little bit of time so I thought I would
do this little voice over on the
beautiful Lily I'll leave all of our
Instagram and stuff down below so first
what I'm deciding with her brows and I'm
just using the light brown brow powder
by Anastasia Beverly Hills and just
lightly filling in her brows
I'm just taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade like just when I
concealer brush and diffuse not to
define above and below the brows
then I'm just taking some more of that
concealer and just placing that on her
eyelids to prep the eyelid for eyeshadow
and then just using the Rimmel stay
matte translucent powder to set over the
top
you
don't taking the benefit cosmetics 3d
brow turns and just ran that through her
brows to set them in place and then but
eyeshadow I'm taking at the new naked
heat palette by urban decay but actually
doesn't come out until the end of August
but I thought I'd show you guys to look
with the palette anyway in case you were
interested in getting one yourself so
I'm just going in with that first
coppery color I love this eyeshadow
palette because it's literally full of
warm tones and that's all I ever use
these days so just going in with like a
medium coffee brown into a crease
you
then taking this shade right here and
pretty much placing that the same
thought as the first shade just to build
up the color
then taking this dark root color and
just mainly focusing that on the outer
corners just with a map-21 seven brush
and maybe need darker shade in the
palette which is a really pretty like
dark purple color and also putting that
in the outer corners as well
so I'm just taking a black flash of air
this one's from Anastasia Beverly Hills
palette and also putting that in the
outer corners
the
then taking the matte creamy color and
I'm using that in the inner corners
then taking the amazing eye studio gel
liner in black and just using that on a
zoeva wink liner brush and just creating
a wing
then I'm just taking a cotton tip with
some Acela water and just cleaning up
the eyeshadow around the edges just to
create a crisp line
and then I'm just quoting her lashes
with the mascara I'm pretty sure I just
used one of the Bobbi Brown one just on
a disposable mascara wand and then I go
ahead to pop on it the model Rock to 1/2
lashes with some duo lash glue
but I'm just taking some estar again
just to blend for false lashes with her
real one I'm just going back in with the
gel liner just to cover up any gaps or
if there's any less white glue on the
lash band so now on your face I'm just
taking them a Scilla water I just want a
cotton pad just to ensure the face is
nice and clean before priming and then
for primer I'm using at the benefit
Porefessional all over but I'm feeding
the mac studio fix fluid in the shade NC
35 yes I'm aware that this is a darker
shade to a face but she does fake tan so
I am matching the color to learn neck
and I'm just stabbing that on with
advanced Beauty Blender
then taking the Maybelline fit me
concealer in light and just placing that
underneath her eyes then I go ahead
place it on her chin Eclipse expose down
the bridge of the nose and a little bit
in the middle of our forehead and then
blending them all out with the dance CB
ones off so make sure when the footage
was of me making underneath her eyes by
just do the Laura Mercier powder for
that and then for bronzing I'm going in
with the new CIT London one and I'm just
using that to bronze up her cheekbones
and yes and I go ahead to put it around
the perimeter of your face around her
jaw and then on the sides of her nose as
well
the bronzer didn't really come up as
harsh as it was in real life like it
wasn't harsh but you could definitely
see it a lot more in real life maybe I
need to play around with the settings on
my camera now that I have a new white
backdrop but yeah I baked underneath
there and then I'm taking this new knife
palette and I'm just taking a peachy
sort of blush and just placing that on
the apples of her cheeks then for
highlighter I'm also taking the new CR
tail under one this is so pigmented and
it looks amazing on so I'm just placing
that on with an Anasazi of Beverly Hills
highlighter brush and yep putting that
on her cheekbones Cupid's bow and down
the bridge of the nose
and then I'm just wiping off the excess
powder from my bake underneath the
contour and because I said these ones
are wasn't really showing up in camera
as well I just went in with more of the
rule of benefit funds I just the brush
it came with it's true further contour
then sit in a corner highlight what I've
actually taken first is the Kylie
cosmetics copper cream eyeshadow and
just placing that as a base for the
glitter because when I went out with
Lily for the first time in Brisbane she
had this beautiful in a corner like
glitter highlight and I was like oh my
god I love it so I tried it like the
next weekend I went out and I absolutely
loved it so I thought I would put it in
this video because she's so used to
having it and I just think it looks
stunning it looks so much better in
person like it comes out so much better
but I just love the look of it so that I
just put a little bit in the star and
I've bottom lashes and then lining her
lips to see cher look line out 5 July
clip
and then that for her lips I'm taking
the to face melted liquid lipstick in
the shade
star I think this is such a free cool
toned mood
they're taking my favorite gloss at the
moment which is a Marc Jacobs one and in
the shade should we shove out over the
top and love the sense of them and just
have a look and then I just spray your
face a bit of the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and that is the
final look done I hope you guys enjoyed
watching I'll leave all of Lily's links
down below if you want to check her out
because she just started a YouTube
channel she's so gorgeous I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see ya next one hi
