channel so a couple of days ago I asked
you guys if you wanted to see a fitness
sort of related Q&amp;amp;A because I got so
many DMS from you guys just asking me
random Fitness related questions what I
eat what I train how to get the
motivation etc etc so I thought I'd do a
video about it just so everyone's
questions and answered all in one spot
all in one go so I asked you guys to
send me in some questions through
Instagram so I'm just going to go ahead
what weight or size will you feel happy
and how did you stay motivated and also
when did you start noticing results so
I've only started my fitness journey
about a year ago and my heaviest was 90
kilos so right now I'm 71 kilos which is
20 kilos down it actually sounds so
crazy to say I've lost 20 kilos because
I actually went through my old videos
and you can definitely tell in someone's
face like I was just looking at my face
and I was like wow it was so around
anyways so I saw my fitness journey
because one of my friends was a member
at this fitness center it wasn't a
normal gym it was just a gym where they
do like circuit training sort of similar
to f45 but I'll explain that later so
basically it was just an hour of just
basically cardio and she's like come
down with me like I don't want to go
alone and I was like no way like I was
just thinking there is no way
I am going down there to make a fool of
myself anyway so she's like come on you
can have a free trial and you can see if
you like it or not anyway so my first
session I remember I was like holy
like I like she didn't want to get on
the cops start nervous I just hated the
way I looked I was yeah 90 kilos or
whatever I was like nah
not gonna be able to do any of this
stuff but I've seen videos about what it
was like before and as I kind of
literally I'm just gonna look like a
dickhead
anyways so I went there and everyone was
so welcoming so nice and there was
people just like me that just started so
they were on the same page as me
I forgot how kind people were in
environments like that I'm just because
I've never really been in a gym
environment because obviously I never
went to the gym that's why I was on
Hilo's but um but yeah I was I felt
really comfortable there and I loved it
so I signed up and I did that for about
six months and I probably lost the
majority of my weight so I probably lost
10 kilos there and then because after
you do exercise for a while your body
starts to adapt to it and it becomes
normal because we're doing the same sort
of exercises so I need to shock my body
and that's when I discovered f45
and I joined f45 compared through what I
was doing previously it was more for
beginners
whereas f45 now is very very intense and
there's specific days where they do
cardio and weights based classes anyways
I'm going soft topic
the question was what size we feel happy
so ultimately my goal is to be 60 to 65
kilos in between there but I still want
to be toned I don't want to look skinny
I don't think the skinny look would suit
me like I've always been a curvier girl
and I personally like that look I like
the look of like curvy legs like I want
a flat stomach like a tone tight stomach
but I like I like the look of thick
thicker sort of girls so I don't want to
be like anorexic least thin like that's
not my goal at all I want to look happy
and healthy and timed so around 60 or 65
depending on yeah
look like them but obviously I won't
know so I thought about eight kilos left
until I'll be happy so she also asked
when I started noticing results so I've
always been one of those type of people
that hate weighing themselves like I'm
just like not first time I weigh myself
was like before I started my fitness
journey I was like already I was like
not I hate waiting myself but when I
started noticing results it was
definitely in my clothes so my clothes
fit so much better I could fit into old
clothes that I bought ages ago and I was
like oh yeah I'll fit into it and I've
actually ended up fitting into it that's
I think what motivated me to just keep
on going oh that question was so long
and so off topic okay so next one do you
think f45 and their challenges are
honestly worth I dunno any alternatives
as f45 is really pricey definitely worth
it definitely one of the best decisions
I've ever made it's the environment
everyone there is so friendly the
coaches are there they're so helpful I
love that type of environment I could
not just go to a normal gym and do my
own thing I would have no motivation to
do that but where is with everybody five
I go with my friends I go with Alex I go
with Vic how many days where you still
ate something unhealthy I'm at f45 and I
love it when I feel like something
unhealthy I feel so guilty how do you
overcome this so right now I'm in an
eight-week challenge with f45 my second
week so they have a whole meal planned
and everything for you to follow but I
can't say I don't have unhealthy
cravings like that is normal what I have
done that's not on the meal plan is if
I'm craving something sweet or I need
like a sugar hit because I'm such a
sweet person so what I do is I chop some
banana put it in the freezer let it
freeze so after denied if I'm still
feeling a little bit peckish and I want
something sweet I would have frozen
bananas in there seriously so tasty like
they taste like an ice cream like it's
amazing you guys have to try it if you
haven't already and everybody if I've
just opened up in my area near me I
wanted to know what sort of
saying they drew weather it's all
classes or one-on-one how do you know
it's the right Center for you instead of
a regular gym membership so f45
is a group based fitness environment
there's no one-on-one training it
doesn't look like a gym it's kind of
just like a studio and depending on what
classes are on on the day and that's the
equipment that's gonna be on the floor
everything is always changing which is
what I love I love doing different
exercises and like different circuits
because I find I get really bored if I'm
doing the same things so they do cardio
Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday and
then on Tuesdays and Thursdays they do
weights based trainings I do actually
have a my fitness routine type in here
that I filmed a few months ago and I
have a three clips of me training in the
studio if you wanted to know what it
actually looks like and what exercises
we do what is your go-to lunch and
dinner meal so as I said before I am
doing this eight-week challenge if you
guys want to see like weekly vlogs of me
like doing meal prep and sharing some
recipes and I would a huntress sent me
to ask that because I actually love to
eat meal prep it's so like therapeutic
like it's so it's because it's so easy
that's why I like it it's not
complicated at all it's definitely like
cooking for beginners because otherwise
if the recipes were like intricate I
would not know do it because I'm not I
wouldn't say I'm the best cook in the
world but they make it so easy to follow
and the meals are delicious so if you
guys are interested in me making like a
little weekly vlog over the next like
six or so weeks cuz that's how long I
have left with the challenge I would be
straight down to make them so let me
know an example of what I had for lunch
I had chicken breast and it was roast in
the oven with spinach and quinoa and
then for dinner
I'll have turkey and veggies for
breakfast
today I had an avocado and cacao
smoothie it was delicious
and then for a snack I had two boiled
eggs and then I had lunch my chicken and
then for another snack before dinner
I'll have a protein shake and that's
I'll have before I go to training so it
is five miles a day and yeah I don't get
hungry unless I'm up really late like
editing or something into 1 a.m. and I
have that last little sweet craving
that's when I'd have my frozen bananas
but I probably only have like half a
banana like I wouldn't have a whole wall
but yeah do you follow the f45 meal plan
to a tee for the full eight weeks not
gonna lie because this is my second a
week challenge the Thursday we challenge
I only cooked a few meals because I was
really really fussy and so instead of
some of the meals that would just have
chicken and veggies like that's just
what I would have instead of some of
their meals and I would have their
snacks and stuff but I wouldn't have
liked their protein shakes they
recommended and yeah I would have heaps
of cheat meals like on weekends but for
this eight weeks I have decided to go
all out and fully strict because that's
how I'm going to get results and it's
only eight weeks like it's just two
months of my whole life that I need to
stick with this diet and then obviously
after the diet I'm still going to go
ahead and eat healthy and it'll actually
give me heaps of meal ideas to cook
after the challenge to obviously
maintain my way how often do you train
and when do you go for lunch and dinner
and how do you maintain your diet and
eat healthy so I pretty much explained
those last two points but how often do I
train so I try and train five times a
week so Monday through to Friday and I
tend to go at night so I have about five
or five forty-five sometimes if I have
work on Fridays I'll go to the Friday
morning class but because I work most
Saturday's early in the morning I don't
go to the survey classes and I find that
Sunday can be my recovery day so I don't
train really at all on weekends and when
did you go for lunch or dinner does she
mean like when I eat lunch and dinner
breakfast at like 9:00
eleven I'll have my snack and then at
1:00 I would have my lunch and then like
around three o'clock I would have my
protein shake or whatever snack is in
the afternoon and then I'll go to
training and then we'll come back and
I'll have dinner so that's pretty much
my daily schedule of eating what did you
do while you're in Europe did you try to
eat healthy or give yourself a break and
enjoyed yourself well I always thought
like before I left here I'm like yep I'm
not gonna have anything unhealthy I'm
just gonna you know try and have the
healthy options every time we go out and
that lasted for about a week until I
started drinking and I was like you know
what drinking is so bad and if I'm gonna
be drinking there's no point of meeting
any healthy so yeah I did let go and I
it's not I've had to go crazy you know
some meals like that I would have the
salad option or I would choose not to
have like passed or whatever but there
was times where I was like you know what
 it like if I wanna have this path I
want to have this ice cream I'm just
gonna have it I'm on holidays I never go
on holidays so I only put on three kilos
in the six weeks that I was away which I
was pretty surprised about because I
felt like I've gained like ten kilos
like I felt like my body was just so
like like I don't know I can't explain I
just did not feel good about my body at
all when I go back my evening wasn't the
best like I still kind of in the holiday
mode so this eight week challenge has
kind of pushed me to stop all bad habits
and try and get back into healthy eating
when did your weight become an issue so
my whole life I've been overweight like
ever since I remember I've always been
that one person in my group of friends
at school that have been one of the
biggest and it's it's always been like
that
and I got to a point where I was
literally looking in the mirror and I
was just trying on clothes I remember
this one night I was going out and I
literally just couldn't find something
that looked
and I was like this like honestly
need to do something about it because
yeah I just I did not feel beautiful in
myself I
I felt like absolute so that's when
I agreed to go with Vic to this Fitness
Club and and yeah that's how it all
started I my mom has been telling me for
years I'm gonna do something about it
and every time she mentioned it just
made me like really upset cuz I was like
a soft spot kind of for me and I'm sure
it's a soft spot for most people when
they bring up weight or or whatever
because obviously most people are so
insecure about that these days yeah I
think that was a wake-up call I didn't
have anything to wear one night and I
just felt like I looked frumpy and
nothing looks good on me and I like you
know what this is when I was like a size
14 to 16 and I was like okay I literally
cannot go into a size 18 because then I
have to start shopping like not at you
know regular stores like dear sure you
know normal online stores that when they
go up to a size large and I was like I
don't want to get to that stage and yeah
I'm so happy I did something about it
like I'm saying about even though I'm
not at my girl way I just feel so much
more confident about myself and yeah I'm
just so glad I took the change for the
better
to literally save my life how do you
stay on track
I honestly could not do a 45 without my
friends like I go with my friends Alex
and Vic I've had a few other friends
come with me a couple girls from work
Alex's sister and we all grow together
and it's just so much fun and they
honestly are what motivate me to go out
like I probably still would go alone if
I didn't have anyone but you always have
to have someone to you know do stuff
like that with and I feel like I always
feel so comfortable when I have my
friends by my side working out with me
we have a laugh and it just was it
doesn't really feel like or it does feel
like your work
obviously because it's hot but
like it's just so much better when you
have people that you know they're with
you along the way that's definitely
what's kept me motivated and knowing
that I'm gonna see them every day it
just makes me happy so yeah what advice
do you have a people that want to lose
weight so obviously it's easier said
than done like there's so many points in
my life I'm like yeah we're gonna lose
weight and then I will try and then I
would fail like the amount of times I'm
just like yep it's going to a detox I'm
gonna you know walk every day and eat
this business it would just last like
two or three days I'm like not over it
this is not working and I just went back
to old habits my advice to you is to
definitely have a friend with you on
your journey because they have
definitely helped shape and motivate me
to the person I am today with this whole
fitness journey
you know sometimes gyms have those
classes I actually did do that for a
while so if you don't have like an f 45
or any group fitness sort of classes
around where you live I'm sure like you
have a gym somewhere there and most gyms
do those kind of like hip classes or
they have like I know for a fact that I
think it's good life or Phoenix or on
the Gold Coast they have classes like
body balance and body attack and it's
mainly sort of the same sort of stuff
that we do in f45 so it's like circuit
base like cardio and weight training so
I would definitely recommend like you
know joining a gym and going to those
classes first it's so much fun and
especially doing it with a friend will
make it 10 times easier so that's
probably my advice drink a little water
I was so bad at drinking water so I
ended up having to buy this massive one
from ASN the true leaders and I drink
one and a half of those a day just
because it's there and I'm like
it worries if I had like a little like
600 okay so my power just died in my
house friendly and I need light so I
just set up next to my window I got next
question is do you drink protein shakes
or take any supplements vitamins etc so
from the meal plan we actually have
protein shakes that we can have as
snacks during the day so for example
like I'd have breakfast and then a snack
would be a protein shake or it would be
natural like an apple or boiled eggs or
whatever and then lunch dinner whatever
so the protein I actually go get it okay
so the protein that was recommended to
me by one of the trainers at f45
was this one it is the way Optima and
the brand is on nutrakey so it looks
like this and it isn't their flavor
chocolate lava cake and holy it is
amazing like I mix it with armorbuilt
because that's what the meal plan says
and it just tastes like chocolate milk
it's so good actually have it here and
I'm gonna drink it's amazing yeah I just
mixed one scoop with about a cup of i'ma
milk and then I put a little bit of
water and ice
if you can hear kids and outlet halls
dude it's a sunny day anyway so that's
what I would have as one of my snacks if
it was on the meal plan but you can't
also have them like post-workout
pre-workout or even as like a meal
replacement if you like I take magnesium
so that helps with muscle recovery and
then I take fish oil and women's
multivitamins in the morning and that's
it and then sometimes I take vitamin C
tablet
but that's one I can't remember but yeah
they're the main tablets and supplements
that I take ok so last question I think
I've already kind of answered it it is
my question is where'd I get all I trade
out f45 as well which session times do
you prefer I got 5:15 a.m. and love the
mornings I feel like I've started the
day well but the avos like 4:30 I don't
feel this energetic I'm not a morning
person like if you know me I hate waking
up like earlier than a day like I just I
love my sleep in so when it comes to
exercising in the morning I'm just like
no thank you so that's why I prefer to
obviously train in the afternoons and I
feel like after I've eaten like
everything in the day I have so much
more energy whereas when I just wake up
and just like I feel so weak and like I
have tried like a few morning sessions
like sometimes I'd go at 9:15 and that's
fine but 5:15 hell no like I struggled
to wake up to do wedding makeup at 5:00
like I could not imagine doing a 45 at
5:00 but that's obviously all down to
personal preference being I like to
Train either five or five 55 depending
on where my friends can go because
sometimes they have work in the
afternoons or sometimes they can't make
it so I kind of like tailor my session
times around them because I don't really
like going alone but if I have to then I
do it's not a big deal or anything I'm
comfortable with the people that are
there and everything like that but yeah
definitely an afternoon type person for
sure I think that is enough questions
for now I hope this kind of helped you
guys and hopefully motivated you guys to
do the same maybe I don't know but yeah
if you guys want to see like weekly
vlogs of me doing meal prep then
definitely let me know because I need
more than happy to I'm sure Alex would
help me because I do his meal prep as
well because he's also doing the 8 week
challenge so I kind of cook for two
people so yeah I'm sure he would be keen
to help me film some of my meal prep but
I'm gonna stop talking out
like I've been talking for around an
hour so thank you guys so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
