channel so in today's video I'm going to
show you what is in my freelance kit
this video is hands-down one of my most
requested videos of all time so I
thought I would film everything that I
would pack in my kit if I was to go out
to a client I do have most of my clients
come to me but for weddings I tend to go
to where the clients are so without
further ado I'll just get straight into
it so this is my case I got this from
eBay and it was like 180 dollars I'll
leave the link below where I got it from
but I probably wouldn't recommend this
if you're constantly traveling like on
planes and stuff because this case
weighs a ton on its own like it weighs
probably at least 10 kilos like it is so
heavy let alone when you put your makeup
in it it's 10 times heavier so basically
I only use this for when I'm just
traveling within my area to weddings and
stuff like that because it's not too bad
for the price I didn't really want to
spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars
on the case
because most of my clients come to me
anyways and eventually I'm going to be
setting up in a salon so I won't need
this as much but you guys requested this
video so I'm going to show you what is
in my kit okay so this is what the kit
looks like open so here I have my most
used brushes that I reach for the most
I'll go through them later on so the
first thing I can see is my baby wipes
these are seriously so essential as a
makeup artist because you tend to get
 everywhere so these are seriously a
lifesaver and then I just carry around a
plastic bag for all of my rubbish and
then I just carry around like a dirty
cloth and this is what I use to spot
clean my brushes so I literally put some
brush cleaner on which I'll show you
later and just use this cloth to spot
clean them next up is the Garnier
micellar water and for obvious reasons I
just use it to remove makeup if I've
made a mistake or if the client has
makeup on before I start I just use this
to deep clean her skin and just make
sure all the makeup is off before I put
new makeup on then I have all of my
foundations and my palettes so this case
came with these clear things which i
think is really really handy because
they're amazing for storing foundations
so the first lot of foundations I carry
with me are the Estee Lauder Double Wear
might make up forever HD foundation and
then just some really dark nice
foundations obviously for clients with
darker skin or sometimes I like to use
it to mix to make a foundation a little
bit darker I do tell my clients that
this Estee Lauder does have flash back
but some people just like the fuller
coverage and don't mind about flash back
so it's completely up to them so yeah I
do let them know that there is flash
back and yeah some people absolutely
love this some people absolutely hate it
so I just carried in my kit anyways
so next lot of foundations I have on my
Mac Studio Fix they are seriously suited
to every single skin type I've pretty
much used these non-stop for the past
two months and they just look flawless
on every single one of my clients so I
have the colors NC 15 NW 10 NC 35 NC 45
and W 45 and W 55 this is just a spare
and C 35 that's almost out but yeah I
really do recommend these foundations
for your kit if you're thinking about by
Mac because they are seriously amazing
lastly out of this section I have my
palette so I like to take my Anastasio
Beverly Hills palettes I take this
shadow Couture one which looks like that
I'm obsessed with pink champagne and
Morocco that's seriously life and then I
have my artist palette which looks like
this I carry around this palette mainly
because of the pops of color sometimes
people are asked for pops of color on
their lower lashline people even just
like colorful eyeshadow so that's why I
take these palettes along because they
are full of warm tones and also um pops
of color sorry next up is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit it just looks
like that absolutely love these two
shades for setting concealer and I
actually like this shade for setting my
eyelids after i prime them but yet I do
care
long as well and then I have the
Anastasia Beverly Hills Pro brow palette
literally has every single color you
could need in your kit for brows so the
next palette i have is the lime chrome
venus palette which has broken
unfortunately but i'm seriously obsessed
with aura i use this on the inner
corners of my clients eyes and if i'm
not using this I'm using shimmer shimmer
I really love icon as well for a really
warm rich brown color so yeah I love
this palette and I always bring it along
with me for the next palette I have is
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette and
it seriously just speaks for itself it's
the most amazing palette I've ever used
it's my favorite palette in my whole
entire collection or Placido palettes I
don't even know what else to say about
this it's just amazing the quality is
amazing it blends amazing it's just
amazing you need it in your life and
finally I have my makeup geek and
Anastasi Beverly Hills single eyeshadows
I love shimma shimma Peach Smoothie
creme brulee cocoa bear Sienna by ADH
and corrupt and then I have another
palette as well with their foiled
eyeshadows by makeup geek so these are
just all their fold eyeshadows these are
so so pigmented and I love to use these
in the inner corners and then these are
just their blushes I don't use their
blushes that often but I love this blush
it's in the color bliss and it's just a
Coralie color actually use that quite a
lot I don't use any of those ones but I
love these for eyeshadows so then these
two zip down and it has eight drawers
which are seriously so amazing and handy
so in the first drawer it's pretty
boring to have some makeup remover pads
and then I have all these bottles which
I got from eBay
this one's just got water in it I just
use this for my Beauty Blender just to
dampen it up if there isn't like a sink
nearby or anything like that
and then I have some brush cleaner so
inside of this one is the cinema secrets
one which is my all-time at faith even
though I haven't tried the Mac one but I
probably will
when this
runs out because it was quite pricey I
have some icicle which I use to
sterilize my brushes and the middle
plate that I have which I put the
foundation on it's just alcohol pretty
much and i got it from Woolworths and
then I have some Urban Decay all nighter
spray I just put it in this little
bottle do save space and then I have the
urban decay D slick makeup spray for
oilier skin I just have some of my
business cards and then I have some mac
fix+ and some spoole ease and some ear
buds and then lastly I have some bobby
pins now I've seriously been a lifesaver
to so many brides that just need some
extra bobby pins when their hairdresser
leaves or something and there's just
that one bit of hair that needs to be
put back I might always carry around
bobby pins for that reason so yeah it's
a pretty boring draw okay so my second
draw I have all of my primers and liquid
illuminators so I have the hourglass
available primer which is one of my
favorite primers to use on clients with
oily skin my still a one-step correct
which is amazing for clients with dry
skin and then also the lumi magique
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone and that's a liquid OBD past
illumination cream my strobe cream and
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot so yeah
that's in the back drawer so in this
drawer I have my concealers and my
beauty blenders of course I have my
Maybelline fit me I have them in the
shade 20 sable sand on the other tour in
the light and then I have my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer ones in NC 25 and
ones in NC 15 and then I have the naked
skin in fair and then the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in custard and then I
just have my rule
Meek's miracle sponges I have actually
ordered some beauty blenders to use in
my clients because I only have one for
the moment but these ones work really
well as well and I just have the Beauty
Blender I'm a cleanser which I use to
wash in between clients in the next
drawer I have all of my face powders
bronzers blushes and highlighters I have
the Australia's fresh and flawless in
three colors I have the face of
Australia translucent powder which is
what I use to bake the Milani baked
blush in Luminoso coralista blush by
benefit the Becca highlighters in
Champagne pop and opal the bar mary lou
manizer the so susan cashmere blush the
sponge that i use to bake with the
dallas bronzer and my favorite hoola
bronzer so yeah that's what's in that
drawer so in this next draw I literally
just pack every single one of my
lipsticks because you just never know
what they want these are just all my
Gerard cosmetics lipsticks and some of
my Mac ones and then in the next row I
have the rest of my MAC lipsticks and
then I just have all of my Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks my wine
chrome ones jeffree star ones and the
new derived cosmetic ones then I just
have my lashes in another drawer I have
red cherry lashes and Kara lashes which
I got from shop miss a calm and they
were only like a dollar 70 each which is
amazing the glue that I use of the House
of lashes lash glue and I just have some
scissors and some Anastasia Beverly
Hills tweezers which are my favorite
tweezers in the whole world and yeah I
just have heaps of different style
lashes for the client to choose from
next drawer is just full of lip liners
lip glosses and pigments so I just have
heaps of different colored lip liners
and eyeliner so I have the nude liner I
have heaps of the L'Oreal Paris ones
that they sent to me some Mac ones
Wellstone and Ruby woo some Australis
ones and then I just have some dried
cosmetic lip glosses some Mac lip
glosses
and some chichi lip glosses in there and
then I have some pigments
this one's from Illamasqua a gold lime
chrome pigment the Mac vanilla pigment
which is really popular the contouring
brush that came in Houla a sharpener and
the Anastasia brow gel so yeah that's a
pretty boring drawer so I have this Zoe
bar buffer brush which is amazing for
buffing in the foundation first and then
I go over it with a damp Beauty Blender
to make it look even more flawless and
then I have these Sigma small contour
brush which I use to contour the
cheekbones and then I have the Sigma n
zoeva angled liner brushes I use these
for brows and also eyeliner as well and
then I have this Jessop concealer brush
which is amazing I just use this for
concealer underneath the eyes and then I
have the zoeva face paint brush just to
define the contour a little bit more and
then my all-time favorite under-eye
setting brush which is the elf blush
brush under map-21 7 so either 2 to 8
makeup addiction cosmetics soft crease
brush the Jessup take and blending brush
the zoeva 2 to 7 luxe definer brush
Sigma e30 9 the Thalia Jade flat shader
brush and also by Thalia Jade it's just
a smaller tapered brush and then just a
lip brush and then I have the Sigma
tapered highlighter brush zoeva tapered
face brush and the Jessup large powder
brush so these are the brushes that I
reach for the most
so I do also bring extra powder brushes
it just depends on how many clients I
have if I have 4 clients I'll bring 4 of
these brushes so I have one per client
because for hygiene reasons I guess I
wouldn't want someone else's brush germs
and face germs on my face next I always
like to use fresh powder brushes and
same goes for kabuki brushes I like to
use one per client because these are
pretty hard to wash in between I have
the zoeva sub finish which I love the
Sigma f80
you the Sigma 3d HD and also the zoeva
flat top kabuki brush as well so yeah I
use one of those perk line and then I
just bring along some more contouring
and blush brushes these ones are from
zoeva and Sigma and these two are just
up and Tahlia Jade as well and then I
just bring a whole lot more of some
blending and flat shader brush in the
brands that I use are mainly zoeva Sigma
Jessup and makeup addictions cosmetics
but yeah and lastly what I forgot to
mention is this metal mixing palette and
I just use this to mix my liquid
illuminators and foundations together
instead of using it on the back of your
hand because obviously it's more
hygienic putting it on this metal plate
so yeah I got this one from eBay and I
think it was like ten dollars so I hope

answer some of your questions during the
