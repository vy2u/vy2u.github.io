so today's video I'm doing another try
on haul I've teamed up with white box
boutique for this video so yeah I'm
pretty much just going to show you guys
what I picked out and obviously you'll
see a little demo Tryon bed as usual
next to me so this was actually the
first time I ordered off white box
boutique so I was a little bit skeptical
on their size it's like usually I'm
around a 10 or a medium sometimes 12 so
I did kind of get a mix of different
sizes just so like next time I order I
know exactly what size - yeah so it was
had any further ado I'm going to show
you guys what I picked up I'll start off
your shoes I picked up these Bellini
flat I'm obsessed with slides like this
and obsessed with the leopard pattern at
the moment so pick these ones up and
these ones are in the size 7 and yeah
they just look super cute on and yeah I
just as I said I'm obsessed with slides
at the moment I just put the camera up a
little bit so it wasn't cutting off my
hair I may as well just go ahead we're
starting off with showing you the
accessories and stuff like that so I got
these I'm not sure how to pronounce the
brand but it's ve UX Sony's they look
like this I love the shape because I
have something similar in my silene Sony
so they're just all black they are super
cute love these second pair of glasses
I chose wear these pink aviators oh my
god I think they are super cute for
photos and just like by the beach I know
that just looked really summery to me
and I'm living for them so yeah those
are the true Sony's that I got and the
last two accessories that I got was this
necklace there by mink collections and
these beautiful earrings I think they're
so dainty and pretty I love them and I
feel like they match perfectly because
I've got crosses on them so yeah those
are the accessories that I've got now I
also got a belt which I actually have
but it's just a nude belt with a thicker
sort of buckle looks like this I
probably wear this around the waist I'm
not usually a fan of wearing them like
weather specialist it on James Oh
sometimes I do but usually I like to use
them with like dresses and stuff just to
like cinch the waist in a bit so yeah
this is the belt that I got super cute
so now on to clothes if you guys watched
my last haul you're gonna be like oh my
god you are obsessed with these kinds of
jumpsuits but I just love them I just
think that's so flattering so it's just
like a t-shirt type jumpsuit and they're
does up at the boob area you'll see what
I mean when I try it on it's so hard to
explain they're super lightweight as
well so perfect for summer so yours I
picked a nice one up so next up I got a
set and these are the mustard shorts and
then it comes with a matching really
really cute crop and it does up here I
just do a little like knot or bow it
just depends but these look so cute
together and you can even mix and match
like you can wear this with like like a
white shorts or whatever shorts you want
so I love that set and then I just got
the shorts in a dusty pink color I
didn't end up getting the top but I just
got the short so I can once again mix
and match in this way this was like
bodysuit or like crops or like t-shirts
whatever but I just think they're super
cute and comfy for summer next thing I
picked up was this white bodysuit this
is so cute probably one of my favorite
items no just like sits really nicely
everywhere and I just like accentuates
your collarbones and I know I just like
this sort of style in like a singlet so
yeah and it does up here and it's really
weird because I it kind of reminds me of
like bra straps it's not like the usual
like buttons they usually click on the
bottom but yeah this is super cute and
once again super versatile you can wear
it with any of those shorts that I
mentioned before and yeah just pretty
much anything so I'm obsessed with this
top top I got is this sort of do cheat
in spite of unknown when I saw it on the
website I was like that looks like Gucci
it was so cool the material is kind of
like it's not ribs but it's a little bit
thicker I love this kind of
right on look at the moment in like
singlets and crop tops so yeah I think
this one is super super cute next
bodysuit I picked up was this car key
one also really really versatile and
once again the bottom kind of reminds me
of bra strap these bodysuits definitely
remind me of the Kukai ones like the
same sort of material except the straps
are a little bit more skinnier and I
think I prefer that just looks a little
bit more I don't know like dainty and
classy but yeah I really really like
this oh yeah by the way I got most of
these in a size medium I suppose I think
I find that it's more of a small medium
than a big meeting you know how you can
get like a medium or a size 10 and it's
like massive on you or like bigger than
what you saw so it's definitely more on
the smaller side so if you're wanting to
something like a little bit more looser
or a little bit more comfortable and
less tight because then this is skin
tight and I'd recommend going a size up
next thing I picked up was this t-shirt
with holes through it I don't know why
but it kind of like gave me a bunch of
vibes like I've seen a few people on
Instagram like where they're usually on
t-shirts and they kind of have like the
rips like this I know I just thought it
looked really different and cool so I
picked it up don't mind the makeup
stains it's white like what can you
expect
but yeah it's super cute you can like
tie it up with a waist you can tuck it
in or leave it out but yeah I just
wanted like a really cool white shirt so
picked that one up next is this bodysuit
now I purely bought this because I have
something very exciting happening in the
next two weeks I don't know if I've
announced it yet but amazing I'll just
announce it in this video but I'm
actually getting a boob job that sounds
so weird to say cuz never in a million
years would I have ever thought of
getting one but I am and I don't know it
like the model on the website I don't
know she had like a good set of boobs
and they looked really good on her
because it kind of like plunge sort of
low and you obviously can't wear a bra
with it but when I tried it on I was
like oh God
as soon as I put it on though I was like
imagine what this will look like when I
have my boobs on anyways so it looks
like this at the front and then you kind
of like tie it at the back and then pull
it in the front and then tie it back at
the back beyond super super super
excited to wear this last few items I'm
actually wearing so this is a cropped
it's not really ribbed but it's a little
bit thicker off the shoulder black top
it's super cute I can see myself wearing
this like pretty much every day in
winter and I just realize I'm also
wearing some shorts from my pops batik
that I didn't even realize I had on
they're like high-waisted you see what
they look like more like on the side
there but that's so comfortable I pretty
much like you wearing them every single
day since I got them so lastly I picked
up this red denim skirt I wouldn't say
it's like denim it's kind of like thin
sort of denim
then I must say that the sizing on this
one is very small like as you can see
when I try it on in is super super tight
I probably would recommend going a size
up if you're around about my size ambi
I've got a medium in this so I probably
could have gotten away with a large I
don't know I don't know if it stretches
it or not but different story I might
wear this around the house see if it
like loosens up and stretches but yeah
it was very very tight as you can see in
the Tryon bit of the video but yeah it
is so it's so cute I think and that is
all I picked up so I hope you guys
