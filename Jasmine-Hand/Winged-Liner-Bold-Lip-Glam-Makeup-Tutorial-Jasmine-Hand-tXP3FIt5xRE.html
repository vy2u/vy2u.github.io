so today's video is going to be of this
makeup look on my face I've recently
just received a heap of new makeup
especially Maybelline L'Oreal and mix so
I thought I would test it out for the
first time in this video and most of the
products that I tried I'm so impressed
with I also tried out a new brush set
that I've received which has Mac droops
in it and oh my god the brushes are
amazing so if you would like to see how
I created this makeup look then keep on
watching first I just want to say I
literally just removed a full face of
makeup you know how when you take off
makeup your face goes all red and like
leftover eyeliner so yeah I literally
hated the tutorial that I just filmed I
don't know why I think it was because I
tried a new foundation I wasn't feeling
it but I'm going to film this one so
hopefully this one turns out better okay
so for primer I'm going to use the NYX
pore filler if you guys have me on
snapchat or know what's going on I went
to a NYX and Maybelline event a couple
of days ago and I received heaps of new
makeup so I thought I would test try
them in this video so this is pretty
much like the same consistency as the
benefit professional it just fills in
your pores and obviously a lot more
affordable I'm just going to spray a
little bit of the Gerard slay all day
just to bring some moisture back into my
skin for foundation today I'm going to
use the fit me matte and poreless in the
shade 220 and I'm just going to top that
all over my face the foundation I tried
in the previous year that I just filmed
before was the Becca the luminous one
and I just didn't like it at all
heaps of you guys like the makeup that I
wore in my drugstore makeup haul so I'm
thinking I might recreate that because
everyone liked like the eyes hello
really simple and it was so easy to do
so I thought I would do that today
 silly I'm going to try the new
master concealer by Maybelline this is
in the shade 30 light medium I think I
need to get my hands on a lighter shade
but this is just what was in the goodie
bag so I'm gonna pour some will squirt
some just going to use a brush to apply
this to my under eye areas I'm just
using the Reeb on a multi shade up 5-3
brush which is just like a stippling cut
brush and I'm just going to place that
underneath my eyes
place up on my chin down the bridge of
my nose and then I'm just going to get a
Beautyblender and just blend all that
out I really want this to be good but so
far so good
this concealer has amazing coverage on
my god I'm just going to take a bit of
the laura mercier translucent powder you
don't have this in your life I suggest
you go out and buy some because it is
amazing
so to set the rest of my face I'm going
to use my trusty Australis fresh and
flawless face powder in the shade
darkest Brown and I'm going to use it on
my reborn large powder brush just like
this by the way I got sent these brushes
in the mail a couple days ago and I felt
them and I was like oh my god they're
literally the softest brushes I've ever
felt in my life
it was so unexpected like I just
randomly got them and I felt them and I
was like what so they were really
generous and set me two sets of brushes
that I have like they're massive I think
this is like their pro brush set or
whatever and it's all black and then
they also sent me this case and it has
pink brushes in it like literally look
how cool they are and by the way this
brush is like a dupe for the Mac 135 I
think it's the 1 through 5 the one that
everyone raves about it so yeah I'm so
excited to try these out but yeah thank
you so much reborn for sending me those
brushes they look amazing and feel
amazing I can't wait to try them you
know when you like see a brush set like
online or like install or whatever and
you see some brushes that you're just
like why the are those brushes
included in that brush set like the
brushes that you wouldn't even use the
sty rounder but like every single one of
these brushes are like amazing and like
they just look like Mac brushes to me I
don't know why but I just wanted to
quickly mention that because they look
amazing but I'll try them in the video
so you guys can see how they work so I'm
going to go in with this large powder
brush and set the rest of my face this
brush is huge now I'm just going to wipe
away that excess powder from the bank
okay I'm so excited to try out this
brush for bronzing I have it in black as
well and it's the reborn powder 12 brush
it's like kind of narrow but I don't
know I think it would be amazing for
bronzing gonna take benefit pullback oh
cool
dead
they're so soft it actually feels like
the Mac brush like even this bit here
and like the whole thing like I don't
know if they're expensive or not but a
really good just bronzing
guys like a little bit more I feel like
I don't even need to contour now like I
feel like it's like done at all I'm just
going to go on the sides of my nose a
little bit so now I'm going to go in
with the becca flower child blush which
looks like this it's like one of my
favorites at the moment I'm taking that
on the reborn blush brush tapping off
the excess because it's really pigmented
I'm just popping that on the apples of
my cheeks and blending it towards my
temples
so the harlot I'm going to use the UH
Nastasia Beverly Hills so Hollywood I
feel like I've neglected this harlot I
haven't used it in ages I'm going to use
the fan brush and pop it on oh my god
this is so nice
so the brow I'm going to try the new
benefit cabal brows but basically I
think it's just like a poem aid so it
comes with like the product there and
then like a little cute brush and then
you flip it around and then you just use
this so I'm like so excited to try it
out okay I'm gonna dip it in this isn't
a shade for first up actually I'm going
to try the new Bravo conditioning primer
looks like this and apparently you use
it before you do your brows for fuller
looking brows so I'm going to take that
so the twist for each brow um okay I
think that's cool alright so I'm gonna
use that it's kind of look like little
bristles so it kind of feels like you're
just brushing out your brows okay cool
I'm going to go in with the homemade
stuff just going to a little bit on the
back of my hand then I'm just going to
go in and fill in my brows
this thing is so weird to just like hold
but the brow brush on the end is
actually really good it's really like
fine and thin so you can get like a
really precise line
should I really like that cool okay I'm
gonna go in with the other brow might
speed this up because it's pretty
boring
so now I'm just going to shape the
bottom of the brows attired I'm going to
take that same concealer we used before
I'm going to take this on the reborn
multi shader brush but it's actually
kind of like a stippling style brush
it's got like synthetic hairs and I'm
going to go ahead and oh my god this
brush is so good for this
I like obsessed with these brushes what
the hell okay go on the other side
I'm gonna pop it on my eyelid as well to
prime the eyelid so for eye I'm going to
try at the new zoeva cocoa blend palette
I've been dying to get my hands on this
this is what the shades look like and
these two shades are like speaking to my
soul I'm so excited I'm gonna go in with
my brush set and see if they have yeah I
have a large crease brush which is
perfect I'm going to go in with
substitute for love which is that color
right there it kind of reminds me of a
deeper version of the creme brulee by
makeup geek what I'm just going to do is
I'm just going to use that in my crease
as a transition shade oh this brush is
so soft
oh these eyeshadows though so pretty and
then I'm going to take the blending 5 5
brush which looks exactly like the Mac
two one seven and I'm going to take
freshly toasted which is just like a
little bit warmer and darker than the
transition shade I'm just going to add
that on the outer corner
this brush is a tad more like stiff and
dance and the 207 but it's still really
good I'm going to take a bit more of
freshly toasted and add that to my lower
lash line so now for liner I did quite a
bold and thicker wing I'm going to use
the true face sketch marker and this is
the black one and I've recently been
really really enjoying this so easy to
use and yeah it just gives you a really
sharp wing so I'm going to go ahead and
do my wing
you
you
I think they look even
so the lashes i'm using the chloe lashes
by billion lashes as a brand and just
going to pop one
philip's I'm using the Jerrod Cosmetics
nude lip liner

Geoffrey star Gemini I bought this like
three months ago and I just haven't even
used it once so I really want to try it
so I'm going to high that
okay I'm living for this color I'm going
to get in with a bit more Highline
obviously I'm going to use the bomb
Marylou just to brighten it all
get on the chin finally I'm going to
take the new Maybelline master fix
