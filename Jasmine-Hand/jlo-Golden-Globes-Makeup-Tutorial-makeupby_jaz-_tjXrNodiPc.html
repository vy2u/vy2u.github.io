today I decided to recreate J Lo's
makeup look from the Golden Globe Awards
I absolutely loved this look on her in
this tutorial I used all affordable
makeup brands that you can get either
online or in-store especially in
Australia because obviously that's where
I'm from
the only thing that I didn't use that
was drugstore was my eyebrows just
because I don't like to use anything
else other than Anastasia Beverly Hills
if you want to know how I created this
look then please keep watching ok so the
foundation that I'm going to be using
today is the covergirl outlast stay
fabulous 3 in 1 foundation I did a first
impression of this it should be up on my
channel there's going to apply it with
this brush
for concealer I'm just going to take my
maybelline superstay at 24-hour
concealer in the color ivory and just
highlight my under eyes with it sorry to
set my concealer in place I'm just going
to take the banana shade on my debt
Beauty Blender from the Australis
contouring kit I saw this technique on
nikkietutorials
like recent photo and it actually works
it doesn't make my concealer under my
eyes crease whatsoever in the picture of
JLo she obviously has fake tan and I'm
pretty fair at the moment so I'm just
going to be taking my L'Oreal Paris glam
bronze bronzer thing I'm just going to
take this kind of medium sized stippling
brush I think it was from ebay but I
think it is Real Techniques and just
place it on my cheekbones and blend
blend blend
okay so now that the base is done I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
with my Australia's fresh and flawless
powder
so her eyebrows are quite light in the
photo so I think I'm going to use my tap
dip brow I'm not quite sure how this is
going to look because my natural brows
are quite dark so and I really really
need them waxed on the ace up so I'm
just going to take that same concealer
that I use under my eyes to kind of make
them a bit thinner so now that my
browser done I'm going to do the rest of
my face so because she has really
sunkissed sort of cheeks I'm going to
use my son club matte bronzing powder
for darker skin you can get this from
Priceline I'm pretty sure this was like
five dollars did I say it was essence
yeah its essence so like really really
super affordable brand
so to contour I'm going to be using my
chichi face bronzer in the shade bronze
me up it's just a matte bronzer and I'm
gonna use that to contour today if you
don't have a brush like this I'm pretty
sure I mention this in an old video just
get any sort of fluffy brush that you
don't use anymore and just with two
bobby pins just stick them on either
side of the brush and it kind of just
makes a contour brush and then put the
bridge I'm gonna take my Australis
contour kit and just using that matte
color I'm just going to be popping that
down the bridge of my nose tapering I'm
just going to take this highlight brush
and just using the highlight from this
kit I'm just gonna highlight my
cheekbones Cupid's bow bridge of my nose
couple my forehead a bit just underneath
my brow above my brow a bit on my chin
so that is the face complete now I'm
going to move on to my I'm just going to
apply my essence
I love stage I primer you can get this
from Priceline as well and it was I
think $5 so bargain okay so I'm just
gonna do one eye off-camera and come
back and do the other one so I'm just
going to be grabbing this color here
it's number 13 on a big blending brush
and just dusting that into my crease as
a first transition shade so next I'm
going to be grabbing this really
beautiful glittery plum purple color
it's in the shade 25 and I'm just going
to be grabbing that on a fluffy brush
and dusting that just above my crease
because I can see that
JLo kind of has a smoky kind of purple
in her upper crease area
so once that's blended I'm just going to
be taking my Coastal Scents go palette
in the color Cairo I got this in one of
my belly boxes I'm not sure where you
can get this I'm guessing Coastal Scents
calm I'm just going to be grabbing this
really dark gray color
of course that's got to happen I'll
clean that later I'm just going to grab
the same fluffy brush and blend those
two colors together so now I'm just
putting my Rimmel scandaleyes like
eyeliner in my waterline and my tight
line I pretty much just poked myself in
the eye before that is why my eyes are
red so now that my upper eye shadow is
done I'm just going to be taking at that
same gray color from the Coastal Scents
palette and running that judging my
lower lashline and smudging that black
eyeliner down now I'm just taking number
13 from morphe and smoking that line out
so it's not as harsh and now I'm just
going to take more of that purple color
from the morphe palette and also apply
that onto the bottom lash line so now
I'm just going to curl my top lashes and
apply a coat of mascara just using the
Maybelline colossal so the lashes that
I'm going to be using today are the LA
mink lashes in the style independent
they are the literally the most amazing
lashes ever they last like 30 to 40
wears on me because I'm really gentle
and take care of them really well
so onto lips I'm just going to be using
this vys lip liner I don't think you can
get these overseas but it's a really
really cheap Australian brand I don't
think that lime crime is considered high
ends because they lipsticks are like
twenty dollars each so I'm just going to
use this one because I don't really have
any other kind of drugstore lipsticks
that match the color in the jelly
picture so I'm just gonna be using
Coquette by Lime Crime
and then I'm just going to pair that
with a kind of new gloss by HD cosmetics

inspiration anyways thank you guys so
