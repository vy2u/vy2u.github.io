this video because there aren't many
videos like this out on youtube and I
feel like it's so important for those of
us that are interested in beauty boxes
Beauty subscriptions and little black
that black let that the little black bag
specifically to kind of get some
feedback from each other up about what
our trading experiences have been like
on little black bag and how things that
have worked things that I haven't worked
because I seriously I'm still figuring
it out um this is my second little black
bag that I have gotten if you're
interested in seeing the video on that
I'm gonna put a link here that will open
in a new window just press when it opens
just press pause on it and watch it
later or watch that first then watch
this one later whatever way you want to
do it I'm also gonna put a link in the
down bar down there is going to be
another link to that video so you can
see what my last little black bag was
and then also the little black bag for a
month before now um that being said I
want to give you some tips on what I've
learned so far by using little black bag
lil black bag is a subscription service
but you don't have to do it every month
you can just log on and in the beginning
of the month and say I don't want my bag
this month basically you pick your bag
then they give you some jewelry and some
some sample items to go with your bag
but you don't know what you're getting
until you hit the checkout button once
your the checkout button you see what
you get and then you get seven days to
trade your stuff with other members to
kind of build your ultimate bag for
details at little black bag calm so
these are 10 tips that I want to share
with you hopefully quickly on things
that I've learned from using a little
black bag number one when you go to
check out your bag um you don't
necessarily have to settle with the
first things that you see so you go you
pick out your bag you go to check out
you'll see your bag you'll see some like
blank areas and will tell you the name
of a jewelry item a plus how much that
jewelry item is worth it'll also show
you some samples you don't have to get
those if you don't like what you see
there you can exit out and go back in
and keep trying until you see a
combination that you like haha learn
that my second month alright tip number
two when you pick your bag you kind of
have two choices you have a choice of
picking it back you really love that you
want to hang on to or picking a bag
that's very expensive that you intend on
trading for other things now and you
pick a bag that you love don't let it go
hold on to that bag don't trade it
because chances be getting that back or
pretty slim to none second thing if you
choose to pick an expensive bag pick an
expensive chip bag because I learned you
don't pick an expensive ugly bag I
picked an expensive ugly bag and nobody
wanted to trade me like it was horrible
like I had $125 bag that I didn't like I
was stuck with it and I was hoping to
trade it for some jewelry items I ended
up trading way down just to get
something if you're gonna pick a bag
that you want to trade pick the most
expensive one that's cute okay new on
the website tip number three is using
the sale section I don't know if this is
going to be around forever but right now
there's a sale section i bought a ten
dollar bag off the sales section i was
going to keep it but then somebody
offered me really cute jewelry item for
it so i took it and the jewelry item was
worth more than the back I'd only paid
ten dollars for the bag I was like yes
who score the only thing is be careful
with trading um when somebody tries to
trade you because if they try to trade
you a sale item some of the sale items
are sold for very cheap on the website
now you may get an offer for something
that somebody had bought that was on
sale if that happens and that sale item
is worth a lot of money you may think
hey i'm getting a seventy dollar item
for a trade for something that is worth
thirty dollars i'm really making out on
this deal until you realize that that
item is not going to be tradable that
seventy dollar item because number one
it's probably ugly and number two
nobody's gonna want something that's
ugly even if it's worth seventy dollars
and especially if it was bought on sale
by somebody they're gonna know that it
doesn't have that hard core value like a
seventy dollar item does that wasn't on
sale if you know what I'm saying so just
be careful with that sales section keep
an eye on what's on sale especially if
you plan on trading that item that
you're getting tip number four people
are complaining a lot about a little
black bag and people not wanting to
trade anymore and I definitely have
experienced that a way to kind of get
around that is to look at
things that have 10 plus people
available for trade the more people that
are available for trade the more likely
someone someone's going to bite on your
offer for trading doesn't always work
but it's definitely more likely if
there's more people that have that item
if only one person has an item good luck
prying it out of their cold dead hands
tip number five jewelry and clothing and
bags are worth way more than samples if
you end up with a ridiculous amount of
samples because somebody wanted to trade
you one hundred and fifty dollars worth
of samples for your $90 purse then you
are going to be out of luck you're gonna
be stuck with a lot of samples I got so
many offers for repeats of samples
because people traded their jewelry
items for samples don't tray for samples
unless their samples that you want to
keep don't expect to get your good
return on samples tip number six um if
you are trying to trade for something
you can mix up your offers so if you
have let's say a sixty-dollar you're
trying to get an 80 dollar bag you have
a sixty-dollar jewelry item and a bunch
of samples and you're going to be
offering a 90 dollar value for this $80
bag so you you offer the jewelry plus
sample a and then the jewelry plus
sample B and the jewelry plus sample c
or pick another piece of jewelry or a
watch for you know you mix it up because
you never know what people are going to
want and they can't say hey I want this
other item of yours they don't have that
ability so make sure you offer
everything you're willing to give for
that item if that's something that you
really want tip number seven biggest
mistake I've made because I've been
cocky about it and I feel like I I know
how to do this but I really don't is
keep a ruler by your computer because
what seems like is gonna be small ends
up coming like this big something that
seems like it's gonna be big like I
thought this necklace was gonna be huge
and looking at teeny tiny that is so
tiny and I'm happy with it cuz it's not
I'm not just looking keep a ruler by
your computer so that you know exactly
the size of the things that you're
getting because it can be extremely
deceiving along with that make sure
you're looking at the pictures of the
mannequin so you can kind of see the
size of things necklace that I got was
super long didn't realize it because I
never bother to click on the man
picture tip number eight I had the most
success trading within a ten dollar
range of value so either ten dollars up
or ten dollars down if you're willing to
give more than ten dollars then go for
it most likely people are not going to
trade you for ten dollars less than what
their item is worth unless you've got
something some kind of really really
really good item tip number nine make
sure you open your bag at nighttime when
you first start because you're gonna
have seven days exactly to trade I I'd
open mine at eight thirty in the morning
and nobody was traded me at four in the
morning so by the time I woke up at
eight thirty i had lost all of that late
trading time to really get my bag good
so you want to open your bag in the
evening when people are up and awake
maybe like eight or nine o'clock we're
probably the best so that you have that
really nice amount of time in the
evening to close up your bag with all of
the things that you want with active
trading going on tip number ten send
stuff you don't like back because you
end up getting either a credit on your
next little black bag for another item
or you can send it back for actual cash
back but it is going to be a percentage
it's not going to be the actual value of
the items there's a calculation on the
website of how they calculate the
returns you know it's jewelry you know
get a little bubble mailer and pop it in
the bowl mailer and it'll cost you like
two bucks to send back totally worth it
to get something completely different
that you actually really like instead of
having this jewelry or whatever it is
around it's like look I will be uh
hopefully doing more videos like this as
I learn more if you have any tips for me
on live black bag please tell me I feel
like I'm doing pretty good but I think I
can always get better with it I would
appreciate any help that you can our
advice that you can offer me there is
another really good video by a girl who
heard channels called pearls and daggers
I'm going to put her link to her video
down below it's a really good little
black bag tip video at this point I
don't plan on doing a January bag
because i'm learning that you have to
really like a lot of items on the
website in order to open a bag and
that's what happened to me last month is
that i liked a lot of things but but i
didn't end up with a lot of the things
that I really want
and I ended up with stuff that was kind
of a mediocre so make sure there's a ton
of stuff in all different price ranges
that you like on the website before you
open your bag so you don't end up
disappointed with a bunch of stuff that
you never would have bought in the store
