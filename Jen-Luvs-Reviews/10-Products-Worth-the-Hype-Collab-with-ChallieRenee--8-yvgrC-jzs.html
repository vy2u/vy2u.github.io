hello my friends welcome to a very fun
and exciting video this is a
collaboration with my friend Callie
Renee oh my goodness she is seriously an
undiscovered gem on youtube I will put
her right there she's so fab she gives
the best reviews I'm not even kidding
she's one of my favorite reviewers on
all of YouTube and she just hasn't been
discovered yet i am telling you you will
love her oh my goodness she's fab so
she's gonna be telling you her favorite
products that are worth the hype and i'm
going to tell you mine so i'm gonna go
ahead and show you mine and i will link
Callie's video down below so let's go
ahead and just jump in get started with
my favorite products the first one is
kind of a bonus it's not really a
product I did ten things and this is
kind of 11 thing but I think this is
really really worth the hype and it is
the shiseido facial cottons now I
remember my friend Laura over at mrs.
Lowell in talking about these and I was
like really seriously like they're
cotton like how how much better can they
possibly be I use these to take off my
eye makeup and there is a huge
difference let me tell you these feel
like um the sponges that you use some
people use for makeup application that
are like triangles these kind of have
that kind of feel but cotton ear where
like these are the typical ones these
are actually I think they're meanie box
brand that I got sent to me in a meanie
box when Mimi box was sending me things
but you'll be able to see the difference
let me zoom you guys in so you can see
the difference if I hide my eyes and it
will zoom in but you'll kind of see see
how this kind of separates and then this
one doesn't so when you're using it this
will break apart as you're using it you
see that where this one does not you see
the difference so it's so much more of a
pleasurable experience using these I
think these the typical cotton pads or
whatever are maybe three dollars or four
dollars these I think are nine so it is
more but in the grand scheme of thing
it's like another five books and really
and truly these things are worth it to
me definitely just because these break
apart and sometimes have to use three or
four of them worse
or that I want to tell you about is the
Smashbox photo finish pore minimizing
primer this stuff is so fab I don't have
big pores but the pores that I have this
fills them in so nicely now this is a
silicone based primer so if you have dry
skin this may not work for you but if
you have oily skin or normal skin this
stuff is so awesome it looks like it's
purple but it's really not it's just the
packaging it comes out kind of like a
light flesh colored and then but when
you when you blend it in it completely
disappears and it is just so incredibly
solved my husband John whenever he wears
makeup for filming or when we go to
beauty events he always uses as he does
have much bigger ports than I do and
this is his favorite he actually
purchased this and we both loved it so
highly recommending on the smashbox
photo finish pore minimizing primer yes
okay next up primer wise the Urban Decay
primer potion this is so hyped up on
YouTube some whoa that's slipping out of
my hands this stuff is so hyped up on
YouTube the Urban Decay primer potion
but it works it really does work it
keeps your eyeshadow on longer it makes
it so the eyeshadows don't freeze I
don't have a creasing problem I have a
lasting problem on my eyes but I've
heard good things from people that do
have creasing problems with the primer
potion it looks almost exactly the same
as the as a Smashbox but it has a
different purpose this definitely feels
a little more creamy you know like a
little more smooth where that one has
more of a silicone this has more of a
lotion II feel to it when you use this
so it's very very important don't ever
put that much on your eyes you want to
use the tiniest tiniest dab just enough
to cover your lid space you want to put
it from your eyelash all the way up to
your brow bone but just enough you don't
want to put on more because you'll
counteract if that definitely worth the
hype Urban Decay primer potion okay so
now I shadows eyeshadow basis is where
we're going next this is the Mac Paint
Pot in painterly this is very hyped up
on YouTube for being an
 base I can't hold on to anything
today it's like I don't know it's like
butter fingers like crazy so I've used
this and used this it has not dried out
on me I can't speak for this for other
skin tones so if you are of a different
skin tone and you like painterly or
don't like pink really I would love to
know in the comments below what you
think so this is the way it looks on my
skin tone it's a very neutral kind of
shade it's not warm it's not cool it's
neutral so that makes it really nice to
kind of mute out the color I've
discoloration in my lids it's got kind
of a tad bit of tackiness to it but not
much just it just a touch it's kind of
clash to feel um and it just makes my
shadow stay on all day long I'll use
that or the Urban Decay primer potion
kind of interchangeably I don't use them
together that's a personal preference
thing but i really really love this as
an eyeshadow base it just kind of gives
you that blank slate to work with some
people say they have trouble acquiring
the same looks that they see on youtube
and sometimes it happens to be because
you're they're not neutralizing
discoloration and their lids but yeah
overall just a really wonderful product
highly recommend the max Paint Pot
apparently my lips doing are they
working I got Kat Von D on my lips and
I'm looking to see it's working I don't
know if it's working i'm gonna do
another coat of this cuz I I feel like
it's kind of wearing off a little bit I
don't know I just ate dinner and I've
got my my brand new kat von d liquid
lipstick in love I'm gonna put that on
again oh look at that look at that look
at that uh-huh that looks better oh the
brightness coming back oh I love it ok
now that my lips are all freshen up I
haven't tested this enough to know
whether it's worth the hype or not this
is the Kat Von D's new look liquid
lipsticks and love I just got this
yesterday so I'm still testing it but I
needed a freshening Estee Lauder Double
Wear oh my goodness amazing totally
amazing this stuff is hyped up so much
on YouTube for being a fantastic full
coverage long wear foundation and it is
exactly that my friend Grady who is
always in chats always hanging out with
me what's up and makeup like love me
some gravy she's getting married
and she said what's a good foundation
for my wedding day and this is one
hundred percent what I recommend it to
her and she really likes it so far so
I'm so happy I recommend to that for her
she has not gone to marry i think it's
September but know that this was going
to be a fantastic foundation for her it
just it's such a fantastic coverage
long-wearing just amazing emilynoel83 if
you know her absolutely loves this
foundation for a reason it is amazing
absolutely amazing if you like full
coverage foundations highly recommend so
let's go back to eyes eyes is not going
to be a shocker Urban Decay Naked 2 this
is the only naked palette that I own but
and I talked about this in a lot of
videos that are kind of like this
seriously like this is so worth the hype
and I love I like cool tones I tend to
gravitate toward cool cool tones more
than warm tones even though I am neutral
uh and and it doesn't look like i'm
giving this a ton of love but it's one
of those things where if I don't feel
like thinking I don't feel like thinking
I don't feel like trying to figure out
what I want to wear for eyeshadow this
is what I reach for when I'm constantly
trying what just happened my booty call
just fell out oh no I'm a booty call
booty call no compatible oh that's so
sad I've been shaking it around too much
apparently so let's be gentle with the
booty call all right so anyway I love
this palette and I I don't own the
original I don't own the three I don't
own the smoky but I've heard wonderful
things about all the other ones of
course and would definitely recommend
this as being a product totally worth
the hype and my booty call keeps falling
out sounds like my booty keeps phone
with eyes alright Kat Von D tattoo liner
in trooper this stuff is absolutely fat
my friend Ilana over at makeup girl
rocks but she is she's one of my oldest
friends on YouTube well she's very very
young but she's one of my longest her
friends on YouTube she just did a video
about this and the amazingness of this
and I could not agree more actually
think she just put it out today as the
day that I'm filming this I could not
agree more the only thing about this is
it does fall to the same trap as all pen
liners that I've ever used and that once
the tip doesn't have as much product on
it it's pretty useless because you can't
I can't get my wing that I like but I
like this one really less a long time
it's it's fabulous it's so hyped on
YouTube and totally totally worth it it
really is a fab liner you can get that
that wing point just like bam bam this
one's starting to run out so you see how
it's kind of sparse because it's running
out and we see so you see how it's not
doing like a like a very opaque line
that's because it's starting to run out
of product and the tip starts to get a
little bit weak but I found that with
every single liquid liner that I've ever
used has the exact same problem they
just need to be replaced every few
months which really you probably should
with an eyeliner you probably should so
I definitely recommend this it is
totally fab if you can get the small one
the small one I feel like last just as
long as the big one you know I just
realized I'd only have got out of
mascara so let me give you let's see
what's a good benefits roller lash and
you really enjoy this mascara really
really enjoy it a lot I don't know if it
lives up to all the claims that it says
but it really is a fab mascara it
lengthens Advani Mieses my mind lashes
have a natural curl so I don't really
notice like a curling effect but it's a
fab mascara it lasts all day for me
doesn't flake doesn't smudge I never
have problems very much with mascara
smudging though so I'm not really a good
judge for smudge but I can say no
flaking and separates my lashes
lengthens blowing my things volumizes
fabulous I do have a video coming up
where I am going to compare these two I
want to get my eyebrows done before I do
this video where I put this on one I
this is the Maybelline lash sensational
and then the roller lash on the other
eye and see if you can tell which one is
which they're actually quite close so
I'm curious to see what's going to
happen it's going to be like a little
game I filmed it once and then something
happened and only half of the video
films so I couldn't upload it so now I
gotta get my eyebrows done again and do
this because I don't want you looking at
these funky you know caterpillar
eyebrows before up close like that so so
yes that's coming up but these are very
very similar if you're looking for a
drugstore do so I guess I have 11 things
hey I have another do penis Mary Lou
Mary Lou I love you this
is from the bomb and Mary Lou is loved
for a reason Mary Lou is absolutely
fabulous I know champagne pop is all the
rage right now i don't own champagne pop
i'm not planning on owning champagne pop
it's limited edition you know I'm gonna
be able to get it very long right now
it's really hot but in six months
there's no going to be no point me
putting in an video show I did not buy
it but Mary Lou is fab absolutely fab
but their color pops lunch money is
almost an exact do it's just a little
bit lighter um Mary Lou is a little
peach year but both have the exact same
effect they're both awesome but this is
totally totally worth the hype even
though you might want to just get lunch
money well up to you figured I'd show
you both but definitely worth the height
okay another while we're talking bout
the balm let's go into Bahama Mama love
this bronzer this is a great contouring
bronzer it's very pigmented but it
blends out very very nicely very easily
and very easy to work with totally
totally worth the hype and then for
blush I picked out my Becca this is the
mineral blush and sweet pea this is the
only Becca blush that i own and i love
it this one I use a lot in the winter
time it's just got it just it's so
beautiful and gives such a nice natural
flush to the skin it gives you that just
came in from the cold like flush so this
is my favorite winter blush and Becca
blushes are very very hyped on youtube
and I definitely agree I only on this
one but based on this one I would say
they're definitely worth the hype and
then finally we have a lip product a
face look creme lip sticks i love them i
think i have four of them but i just
wanted to show you my favorite this one
is in pink chocolate again moving into
fall i wanted to show you this one since
we're getting there it's all guess we're
getting there this one is so fab so fab
such a beautiful shade they really fit
in well with that marsala trend that was
going on because of the Pantone color of
the year last year this is was the
perfect marsala tone but it is a
gorgeous fall lipstick very very
moisturizing don't expect it to last
forever though it's not a liquid
lipstick it's not going to be on your
lips past lunch you definitely want to
reapply it a pretty I mean a normal
amount for a regular lipstick but it's
so moisturizing and the smell just very
very light sweet smell but nothing
obnoxious it doesn't have that lipstick
II smell it just smells good you know it
smells like a nice light vanilla so this
is my favorite favorite lipstick formula
totally worth the hype so those are my
products worth the hype i hope you
