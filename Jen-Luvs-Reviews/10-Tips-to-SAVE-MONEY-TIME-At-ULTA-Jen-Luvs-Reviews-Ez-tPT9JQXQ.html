tips for shopping at Ulta feel like Ulta
is one of those companies that really
does a good job at getting us to spend
money but I do also feel like they hide
some things from us especially when it
comes to us keeping money and them
earning money so if you're curious about
those things definitely stay tuned I'm
gonna share those with you or right now
I want to preface this video by saying
that there is a way that you could
actually spend more money by watching
this video so I want to warn you how
you're going to not spend extra money by
using these tips and what you're gonna
do is you're gonna think in your head
before you buy it if I wasn't going to
get a gift with purchase if I wasn't
going to get extra points if I wasn't
this wasn't a buy-one-get-one-free
situation would I actually buy this
product and if the answer is no you are
not going to purchase it because then
you were actually spending money rather
than saving money so we're gonna make
sure our brain is tuned into
anti-consumerism as we listen to these
tips because I don't want you spending
extra money because of this video I want
you to save money so with that in mind
let's go ahead and move to the first tip
and the first tip is the gifts with
purchase the gift with purchase are
sometimes a little bit difficult to find
and you really can't find them in store
it's very difficult to find them in
store so I'm gonna go ahead and show you
how to find the gifts with purchase
online so here's what you're gonna do
you're gonna go straight to the Ulta
website and you're gonna go down to
where it says sales and coupons this is
a gem of a section on this website and
then you're gonna click on where it says
gifts with purchase now if you look it
says buy more save more that's all of
the buy one get one freezing all that
and then you can click on gifts with
purchase now these are the best sellers
for the gifts with purchase but you can
also use the drop-down to sort by new
arrivals so that way if you check this
section often you'll be able to go
directly to the things that are
brand-new on the website
and if you're in store all you need to
do is when you go up to the checkout
line say hey or any of these do I have
gift with purchase with any of these and
they will look it up for you and find
out for you so that's a weight great way
of saving money and that if you get a
mascara sample girlfriend of a boyfriend
you don't need to go out and buy that
scare up for three months because you
know that most of those mascara samples
will last you a good solid three months
tip number two is the sales section of
the website the sales section changes
almost daily if not daily there's new
deals all the time for different sales
as you can see right now they have a lot
of really good stuff on sale from
two-faced and tart and the new lorac
mega Pro 4 palette is on sale I mean
they've got hoola bronzer I mean these
are like classics and new arrivals and
its really really great I mean and
sometimes they change daily so you
really want to make sure you come back
and check often you can also sort these
by new arrivals but just remember that
this is new arrivals to Ulta not new
arrivals to the sales section so it
doesn't sort kind of the way that I wish
that it did but it is a different way to
look at the products especially if you
check this section really often
especially for products that were
limited-edition or products that they're
changing the packaging I remember when
they change the packaging of the Urban
Decay primer potion those primer pushes
went on deep discount from like $20 to
$10 and those things are amazing
the only difference they weren't
changing the formula they were just
changing the packaging so that's a
really great time to buy things that you
always wanted to try or things that you
just want to stock up on because they're
your favorites things like the lorac
Pirates of the Caribbean collection that
I absolutely love I will link the video
that I did down below in that collection
but when it first came out of course it
was at full price and as it was going
out it went on like 50% sale and it was
like oh I should have waited for a 50%
oh I can't as a reviewer wait for 50%
but I wish that I could have because
those products really were fabulous if
you don't jump on those limited edition
items in the beginning you do run the
risk of them selling out and not being
able to get them but if you feel like
it's something that you could kind of do
do without you're waiting for reviews
anyway wait until the season starts the
end-to-end start looking in December
January for those holiday items
are going to be on deep discount not
just Ulta but also at Sephora another
thing I wanted to mention is while
you're on the website looking at the
sales section you can also check out
their mailers that you get in the mail
you don't necessarily have to keep those
because you can always get them on your
phone I don't know if there's a way to
turn off the mailers but keep the emails
I'm gonna have to ask it all to how to
cut off the mailers because it's such a
waste of paper and I don't need the
mailers I don't use them I always just
look on my phone this is a big one this
is a really big one if you are not
signed up for their emails you have to
sign up for their emails I know junk
mail and email is annoying I get it I
totally get it
but the best sales and deals come
through email the 20% off coupons the
ones that are just on the drugstore
items and then there's ones that come
out that are for everything in the
entire store like a blanket 20% off the
entire store coupons you won't get those
unless you're signed up for their emails
it's not one that you can pull up on
your phone because they give you a
specific code that is just for you so
make sure you're sign up for their
emails super super important if you
download their alta app you will always
have their newest coupon which is
usually like 350 off a 15 dollar
purchase or whatever you always want to
have that with you because no matter
what you should be able to use that on
any like drugstore type item that you
are purchasing speaking of that you
really want to save on your frustration
by knowing which items in the store are
prestige items I know when I first start
shopping Ulta this was a really
frustrating thing for me because I would
you know get all my stuff I would go up
to the counter with my twenty percent
off coupon and they'd be like doesn't
work on this that's prestige doesn't
work on this that's prestige and it's
like and then I ended up getting you
know 20% off of a three dollar lipstick
or whatever in its look so knowing what
the prestige items are and what the
drugstore side items are the procedure
items are typically brands that you
would see at like Sephora
they're the more expensive higher-end
most ulties if not all ulties have their
stores separated into two sections the
right side and the left side for me the
right side of my store is all the
prestige and the left side is all of the
drugstore type stuff of course when
you're in Ulta you can always ask an
employee if something is a prestige item
or not but I feel like they do a really
good job at least at my
of keeping the prestige separate from
the drugstore side one thing people may
not know is that you can use outside
coupons at Ulta so like if you're
looking in your local paper some people
clip coupons out of their local paper
and there's a Revlon coupon for two
dollars off of a mascara you can use
that with your three dollar and fifty
cent off of a fifteen dollar purchase
coupon and you can use them together and
basically pay you know three dollars for
a ten dollar mascara which is really
really awesome
speaking of coupons in order to get the
email coupons I believe you have to be
signed up for their rewards program but
I honestly don't see any reason why you
wouldn't want to be signed up for their
rewards program the way the rewards
program works if you don't know is that
for every dollar you spend you get one
point for their reward system if you
make it to their platinum status which
is four hundred fifty dollars per
calendar year then you get one point two
five points for every dollar you spend
we'll talk a little bit more about
platinum in just a second but unlike
Sephora where you save up your points
and you get like this little teeny tiny
mini face cream for a hundred points
which means you spend a hundred dollars
which is out absoloutly giuse Ulta
actually lets you use your points toward
dollars in their store it says that's
really really awesome but really make
sure one thing you want to make sure of
is that you save your points as long as
possible because when you saved your
point juice you end up getting more
money off so what you're gonna do to
make sure your points aren't expiring is
you can go to your account on the
website and it'll actually tell you if
you have any points expiring let me read
this off the website because I don't
want to get this wrong it says the
points will expire at the end of the
quarter one year after the date they
were earned this is only if you are not
platinum if you're platinum then your
points never expire you see how they're
trying to get you to be platinum they're
seeing trying to get you to spend more
money they're very very smart over there
at Ulta while you're in your account
checking your points and your point
status you'll also see a section where
it'll tell you different purchases that
you can earn multiple points on this is
another thing that they can get you on
remember we're not going to buy these
things unless this is something we would
have actually bought anyway so just a
reminder you know we're gonna
anti-consumerism in these tips as well
just a little bit more about platinum
status because if you do happen to spend
$150 at Ulta in a calendar year they
really do give you a lot of things they
very much reward you because they're
smart like that because they know if it
makes it look like they care about you
and give you lots of little tiny things
that give you these little bread crumbs
you're gonna keep coming back and
shopping for more and more and more so
and and when their competitors aren't
doing that where are you going to go
you're gonna go where you get the best
rewards so with the Platinum rewards
which are actually really good you get
special access to newly released
products you get more and better coupon
opportunities you also get more bonus
point earning days a lot of things like
that moving on to the next one we've got
a platinum version and a non platinum
version so for non platinum members you
do get a birthday gift and the birthday
gift is the same for everybody so in
your birthday month you go in and they
check your account and you get your
birthday gift if you are plenum you also
get a $10 gift card on top of that
another tip that I am really bad at even
though my Ulta is not that far away from
me is making sure if I'm buying
something small to try to go into the
store and buy there rather than paying
for shipping I feel like one thing that
Sephora has over Ulta is their shipping
charges because you can get into that
program where you can pay a certain
amount I think it's like 10 dollars
something like that I'll let you know
when I do one of these for Sephora how
much it is but you can get free shipping
for a year or if you're a Rouge member
then you get free shipping but with Ulta
there's no benefit there's no deal with
free shipping so if I'm only gonna buy
less than $50 I think is the threshold
for free shipping if I'm gonna buy less
than that I really should be going into
the store to buy it so that I can save
that six dollars or whatever for
shipping I'm really bad at that one
though I need to start practicing what I
preach on that one you may already know
this one but the Ulta 21 days of beauty
are awesome you can get 50% off a bunch
of different products that have been
popular throughout the year some more
popular than others the big drawback to
21 days of beauty is you don't know
what's gonna be in the 21 days of beauty
so it's not like you can be like oh I'm
not gonna buy this now because I know
it's gonna be in 21 days of beauty later
like you never know until the mailer
comes out right before the sales starts
we do mention those in my makeup
show called what's up and make up when
those are coming out and we do do
updates every week so if you're curious
about when that's happening and what the
sales are make sure you're subscribed so
that you don't miss that one that comes
out the last thing I wanted to mention
is the return policy at Ulta which i
think is really very very reasonable
within sixty days as long as you have
the receipt you can return a product but
that only is as long as it is at least
80% full so you can't you know use up
most of a product and then try to return
it within sixty days you can't do that
the other thing that's kind of slimy so
don't don't do this just to be slimy but
if you did get a gift with purchase you
can keep the gift with purchase and
return the item but don't just do that
just to get the gifts with purchase and
hoard them because that's just wasteful
and mean and honestly like with Sephora
and altars return policy it makes me
feel more brave as a consumer and it
also actually kind of makes me spend
more money because I know that if I
purchase something I know that if it
doesn't work out for me I can return it
and it makes me feel better about buying
something knowing that I'm not gonna get
stuck with something that I absolutely
hate if you have any tips for shopping
