for shopping at Sephora my goal today is
to help you to find the best deals save
the most money and get the most awesome
stuff for the best price that you can
possibly get it I've got so much to
share with you let's go ahead and jump
into it right now I just did a video
just like this about Ulta I will link it
at the I that's right above my head I
believe right there also link it down in
the description below if you're curious
about tips for shopping at Ulta but
today it's all about Sephora without
talking your ear off let's get into the
first tip so the first one is to find
the beauty sales section of the website
the best time to look at the section is
right after the big pops of makeup
releases so December January and then
May June those are the times when all of
the stuff that came out in the holiday
time or in the spring releases those all
start going on sale especially the
things that were limited-edition you
check that part of the website at any
time of year but that is when you're
going to find the best stuff sephora's
also started something new recently
called weekly Wow's they're released on
Thursdays and they will get you 50% off
of items at Sephora there's usually like
five six seven products up there at the
weekly Wow's but you do need to check
them every single week if you don't feel
like checking them we always announce
them on my makeup news show called
what's up and makeup that you can find
every Sunday on the channel so you can
just watch my show and then you'll know
and you don't even have to remember to
look because we'll always tell you if
you're an in-store Sephora shopper
there's also the beauty steal section
there are these little end caps where
you can find products that are on deep
discount usually these are things that
have been discontinued if you're curious
about trying Sephora brand products a
lot of times you'll find Sephora brand
products in these endcaps on discount
the second tip is learning how to
navigate the Sephora website to find the
most recent products that were released
if you click where it says new releases
at Sephora you're not even gonna find
1/4 of the things that were recently
released usually by the time it gets
into the new releases it's already at
least 3 weeks old so let's go ahead and
go over to the Sephora website and I'll
show you exactly how to find the
absolute latest
releases at Sephora on the Ulta website
if you go to the new releases they'll
all be listed I feel like it seems like
Ulta automatically feeds all of their
new releases to their new release
section so 4 is not like that so like
for example if I go to shop and then I
go to makeup and I go to just arrived
what we're going to see are the newest
arrivals that Sephora really wants
people to buy so of course we have all
of the fancy Beauty stuff that came out
a couple of weeks ago the Sephora
favorites kits the hood of beauty
foundation the hood of beauty eyeshadow
palette the Anastasio Prizm palette and
Zi these are not the absolute newest
releases some of these have been out for
quite a while so the way you're going to
find the true new releases is you're
gonna scroll back up and you're gonna go
to the same part you're gonna go to
where it says makeup but you're gonna
click on whatever section you're most
interested in I love eyes so let's go to
the eye section it automatically
defaults to best-selling but we don't
want it to go by best-selling that's
what Sephora wants you to see what we
want to see are the newest releases so
as you can see we have the yet to be
released color pop golden state of mine
eyes shadow pal that's gonna be out on
the 31st we have a new palette from
black up Lily lashes I mean all of this
stuff wasn't even showing up on the new
release section of course we do have the
Fenty Beauty stuff but you also have a
lot of other things that you may have
missed if you've relied just on Sephora
to tell you what was new looking to try
products but you're not necessarily
interested in buying a full sized tip 3
is to look at the Sephora favorites kits
those mostly used to come out only at
the holiday time but then I guess they
realized they were such big sellers that
they started releasing them other times
one of the best best ones if your
perfume lover is the perfume ones those
things are ridiculous where what you do
is you get these little vials and you
pay if not sure exactly how much you'll
pay for all these little vials to trying
different perfumes but then what you do
is you take your coupon in to Sephora
and then you trade that in for a
full-size usually the full-size product
is worth more than what you paid for all
of the samples it is a fantastic deal I
believe the lash - also has the little
certificate where you
can get the full-size not all the
Sephora favorites kids have one of those
so look on the packaging to see whether
you do receive a full-size with your
purchase of a Sephora favorites kit the
value of these Sephora favorites kits
are ridiculous in comparison with the
full-size product the number on the box
where it will show you the value of it
is actually based on the sample amount
in comparison with the full-size so for
example let's say the full-size product
is a full ounce but you're only
receiving a half an ounce in the Sephora
favorites sampler they will value it
based on half of the price so let's say
it was a $40 full-size they'll only say
that that is a $20 value because it's
only half the price if that makes sense
so don't feel like that the number
that's on that box is for the full-size
products that's actually for this for
how much product you were actually
getting in the Sephora favorites kids I
mean the the value on these are insane
if you are interested in trying those
products but what I encourage you to do
is really truly look at the things that
are in those kits number one have you
already tried some of the things that
are in the kit number two are these
things you're actually going to use or
is it really only just a couple of
things that you're interested in trying
and would you actually be better off
buying the full-size of those one or two
things instead of buying that whole kit
speaking of that dilash - ones are
amazing you will have an entire year of
mascara in that one box because you're
really supposed to throw throw away your
mascara every three months anyway so if
you've got six mascara samples in there
or even four mascaras samples in there
you've got an entire year of mascara
right there for very very inexpensive
and they're all high-end mascaras which
is super cool another thing to keep in
mind is that Sephora is inside JC
Penney's actually have their own Sephora
favorites and samplers kits so don't
neglect your Sephora inside JCPenney if
you have one of those because you may be
able to find kits that you can't get
online and you can't get it in a
full-size Sephora store so keep that in
mind but if it's not in one of those
favorites kits I actually want to
discourage you from getting those small
samples that are in the checkout line
those you know almost it's like the
candy at the grocery store you know that
they oh you know I've always wanted to
try that let me grab that
you know sample size of primer or let me
try that sample
sighs a small blush whatever it is that
I've always wanted to try that's the
only time you want to buy one of these
sample sizes is if you truly have no
intention of buying the full-sized
because a lot of times the sample sizes
are much more expensive when you think
about in comparison with the full-size
then the full-size is they really want
you to buy while you're standing there
in line they really want you to grab
things extra things don't fall for it
for example I just picked a random
sample that I've wanted to try which is
the first Solly unicorn essence the
full-size is a full ounce but the sample
size is I think point three six ounces
so you'll actually be paying four
dollars more which isn't a whole lot for
if you had gotten the exact same amount
of product in the sample bottles but a
lot of them are even worse than that
four dollars isn't a ton but so I would
be better off buying a full-size of it
if I was planning on using it a lot for
me the unicorn essence isn't something I
would probably run through an entire
bottle of so the sample size would
probably be better for me the next thing
I want to talk about is the free samples
okay and how to get the best free
samples so as you know when you go once
a for his website you can pick out three
free samples but did you know you can
get a fourth sample and the way you're
gonna find that fourth sample is you can
download the app or you can bookmark the
link that I have in the description down
below and that will take you to the code
offers every time you order you can put
in a code to get something for free a
lot of these are free with a twenty five
dollar purchase of any item sometimes
they'll be brand specific where you have
to buy from a certain brand in order to
get the deal but some of them are just
with any purchase and you can look on
the app to find them there's a place on
the app where you can look at them
that's where I look at them or again
they kind of hide this section from you
on the website I don't even know how to
get to it from the homepage
the only way I know how to get to it is
from the link that's down below so
definitely make sure you check that out
and don't forget to enter that code at
checkout so you can get it's usually a
deluxe sized sample for free also the
free samples in store these are really
really great now I've heard a couple of
different things about this and maybe it
varies by location by Sephora location
but some places will say you can get up
to three samples in a day of different
products some places will say it's an
unlimited number of samples per day
I personally have never gotten more than
three samples actually I don't think
I've ever gotten more than two samples
it's a great way to try out foundations
primers face creams moisturizers eye
creams especially an eye cream because a
little sample is gonna last you a really
long time perfumes things like that from
everything I know about Sephora they
don't sample lipsticks they don't sample
eyeshadows they don't simple blushes
things like that
but you can get those liquid products
mostly liquid and cream products you'll
be able to get a sample this is also a
great way to avoid that checkout line if
you can get a sample of one of those
primers that's in the line instead of
spending $15 or whatever on a you know a
big container of it it's a great way to
try it without even having to spend
anything at all speaking of the samples
okay this is just my personal opinion
and based on what I've observed at my
personal Sephora I personally don't
recommend getting makeovers or using the
testers at Sephora at all this is from
just my personal experience and I just
lay it out there the way that I know and
from what I understand the Sephora
employees pull from the shelves in order
to do their makeovers I had this
experience specifically when I went to
the vib Rouge event someone had asked to
try the Fenty gloss and the cast member
that's the employee at Sephora went over
to the Fenty gloss that was on display
it was almost completely gone she pulled
it off she took her tester and she liked
her her personal you know single
throwaway tester that's completely
sanitary dipped it in the lip gloss and
then applied it to the customer
the problem with this is you don't know
if someone has come by grab that gloss
put it directly on to their lips before
that gloss has now made it to you so
that is I do not get makeovers at
Sephora it grosses me out it freaks me
out I the only thing that I test that
all is Sephora is I will take I will do
swatches like on my hands and things but
I will never never put anything on my
face or take a sample of anything that
is not in a pump bottle or something
that can be squeezed out anything that
can be touched or dipped or anything
like that with someone else's germs on
it I do not ask for samples and I do not
touch it and I do not put it on my face
if you feel comfortable getting
makeovers at Sephora please by all means
do it's a great way to test out products
and get advice it's just for sanitary
reasons that is a personal choice that I
do not do it I did want to include it
though because I'm not sure if everyone
has thought about it from that
perspective and I just wanted to throw
it out there in case you hadn't thought
of it that way so that you can make your
decision of whether it bothers you or
not the next part I want to talk about
is their beauty insider program and I
actually really like ulties reward
program better but I did want to go into
Beauty insiders because there are some
benefits to being a beauty insider when
you sign up using your email what you'll
get is you'll get one point for every
dollar you spend
Sephora does have some point multiplier
deals and things like that but I
personally they never seem to be on
anything that I want so I don't think
I've ever gotten point multipliers for
anything but they do exist so keep your
eye on their emails one thing to keep in
mind is if you do shop at Sephora inside
JCPenney you can you get points at the
store in store but you can't earn points
online at JC Penney a big controversial
thing that happened was that Sephora
announced that points would now expire
but here's the thing this is the truth
about it is that they only expire if
your account is inactive for 18 months
meaning you didn't claim your birthday
item which is free you you haven't spent
any money at the store in 18 months then
your points can expire so no most of
people watching this video probably that
doesn't apply just like Ulta Lisa for
our rewards points are tiered so at $350
you become a vib very important Beauty
Insider and then at $1,000 spent you end
up as a Sephora VIP Rouge just like with
the points accrued JCPenney com does not
allow you to earn toward your VI BMV IB
Rouge status so the lesson here is don't
shop on JCPenney comm unless you don't
care about the point system at all
speaking of the VI BMV IB Rouge specials
let's talk about the semi-annual sales
Sephora does have semiannual sales where
they have 15 well actually it's 10% to
20% off the entire store so these happen
in April and they also happen in
November so the April one is a little
bit less and it is gradient so if you
are a beauty insider you haven't spent
three hundred fifty dollars you're going
to get the least
of discount all the way up to VIP over
VIP Rouge which is going to get the most
discount so in April that ranges at
least last year I believe it was from
10% to 15% I don't think it went up to
20 and then the winter sale the one
that's in November it's I believe 15% to
20% they also do the sales staggered so
vib Rouge is the sales will start first
and then the next day or two the VIPs
will start and then the next day or two
the Beauty insiders will start so it's a
staggered sale there's another thing
that they started at Sephora and it's
like a VIP thank you thing that you get
in your email that's why you want to
make sure you have your emails turned on
for Sephora in December you get a
special code that will actually get you
$20 off any purchase if you are a VIP or
a VIP Rouge it's like a free gift card
from off of any $50 or more purchase so
that is a significant just kind of thing
that's like 40% off if you spend exactly
$50 which is insane that like never
happens at Sephora so definitely make
sure you have your emails on especially
in late November early December it's
also important to understand Sephora's a
return policy which I feel like is one
of the best return policies in all of
everywhere a return policy it's so
amazing especially for someone that's
really busy and may completely miss that
30 day window so let's just talk about
I'm gonna read it off of my notes
because I don't want to mess it up
the online orders must be gently used
and returned within 30 days of purchase
with a packing slip if you're going to
return online but if you can return
in-store it is much better
you can return online purchases in-store
but if it's been 30 days or less you can
get all of your money back but if it
hasn't been you can actually get a gift
card for the value of your item or you
can exchange it of course and that's
really really nice the only thing about
that is it has to be used in store you
can't use that little gift card online
it's like a merchandise credit it's not
really a gift card it's a merchandise
credit it's not one that you can type in
online you have to use it in store so
that's the only bummer but if you've had
something for two months and you realize
that you have never used it you never
wanted it you don't want it all if you
starve the receipt you can bring it back
and or if they can look it up in your
purchase history you can bring it back
and get all of your money back and buy
something else it's a
the next one has to do with their
shipping I know for me I hate paying for
shipping
I absolutely hate it I don't know why
it's like a thing in my head like I feel
like they owe me the shipping I don't
know why I know that's stupid I know
shipping costs money I ship things to
people I know it cost money but I hate
paying for it myself you do get free
three-day shipping for purchases over
$50 but you can also purchase something
called Sephora flash it's $10 a year and
you get free two-day shipping which is
totally worth it if you're going to
order more than once
sometimes shipping can be ten eleven
dollars something like that so if you
buy the Sephora flash then you get your
money back right away it's totally worth
it it lasts for a year the only thing is
is it does auto renew so if you don't go
and cancel it you will be charged the
next calendar year for it
you can cancel it by calling their
customer service you can email them or
you can go to your account to cancel it
at any time the other thing that's
important to know about the flash is it
doesn't work for Pio boxes APO FPO
addresses Alaska Hawaii or outside of
the US so if you're one of those people
it doesn't work for you unfortunately
but if that's not you I definitely
recommend getting the ten dollar flash
the other thing is this if you do happen
to get two vib rouge status which is
that thousand dollars a year you do get
free shipping it's really smart up
Sephora to do that because these are
your most most hardcore beauty junkies
and if they get free shipping they're
gonna be more likely to spend more and
more and more and more so super smart
ins four is end there and the last one
is one that I completely forgot at Ulta
but this applies to Ulta too is to check
a beit's before you shop online this is
so so awesome I don't know there's
anybody that hasn't done a bitch yet but
if you haven't I do have a regular
customer referral link down below that
you can feel free to use or you can just
go to ebates.com
i do get money if you sign up using my
link just like anybody else I'm not
affiliated with Ebates
but any customer when you get someone to
sign up using your link you can get
money like straight-up money which is
amazing but anyway if you read the
comments down below you I'm sure we'll
see people vouching for Ebates it is
stinkin amazing anytime you shop
especially during the holiday season
online it's a
great way you just get cash back you
click on e baits and you click on the
store you want to shop at and it'll say
something like you know oh you're on
your way to four percent cashback or
you're on your way to ten percent
cashback and then you get a check I
think it's every quarter you get a check
of just money for shopping like you
normally would have it's amazing there
are a couple of other websites that I've
heard of recently I can't vouch for
these though because I've never used
them one of them is student rate comm
but you have to be a college student I
believe I don't think high school
students work Sephora has a 10% off deal
there and then something called ibotta
it's an app that I've recently been
seeing some ads for and I think you can
use it for a lot of different stores but
again I can't vouch for it I've never
used that I've only seen ads for it but
it might be something you want to check
out it's definitely something I'm gonna
be checking out to see whether it's good
or not but again can't vouch for it so
if it's not good I didn't tell you it
was good I just mentioned it so that you
could look it up if there are any ways
that I did not mention there are tips
