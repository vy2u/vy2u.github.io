really fun and exciting video today I'm
going to share with you some brands that
just knock it out of the park there's so
many makeup brands out there and it's so
hard to navigate which ones are really
worth your money so I'm going to break
it all down for you right now this video
was inspired by a person on YouTube that
I have been subscribed to for a short
period of time but I am really loving
her channel her name is Samantha March I
will link her channel down below she
just did seven brand you should try in
2017 and I was like yes I want to do
that too so now we're going to do it
don't forget to check out Samantha's
channel it's really good she puts out
like 4 videos a week and lots of really
good content over there so make sure you
check her out
I couldn't narrow it down to 7 I just
couldn't so I have 11 brands going to
show with you and I have ranked them and
I am going to bring you two products
from each brand that I think you
definitely need to try the best thing
about this countdown is every single one
of these brands is cruelty free so let's
go ahead and start with number 11 so the
number 11 brand that you need to try is
a brand that I just did a full brand
review on over 30 products I've tried
from this brand and it is the bomb and
it's really the balm but my Baltimore
accent makes me go balm and it sounds
like balm so it's the ball um I have to
physically put my tongue on my teeth to
do it but the products that I want to
share with you that I think you should
definitely try are the in stain blushes
they're insanely long wearing they're
really really wonderful and the matte
eyeshadow palettes especially then meet
matrimony I haven't tried the meat matte
adore but the meat matrimony has
definitely been my favorite of matte
eyeshadow palettes the formula is
amazing if you were a matte eyeshadow
lover I definitely recommend picking
this up the look that I created in the
video that was the balm brand review was
from this palette and I got so many
compliments on that look every time I
wear this palette I get compliments on
it because it creates such a natural
beautiful look because the shadows
so opaque and easy to blend in with one
another it's a really wonderful palette
highly recommend the number 10 brand I
want to share with you is essence
essence is a drugstore brand i buy my
essence at Ulta I know there's some
other drugstores you can get it but they
have some really stellar products some
of the stuff is mist but some really
good stuff their eyeshadow palettes
these right here I have three different
ones I have the grey one I have this one
and then I have like a pinky one these
are really really good for drugstore
eyeshadow palettes are they the best
eyeshadows I've ever tried in my entire
life no but for drugstore pricing they
are amazing and then the mascaras I will
tell you that these are some of the best
mascaras I have ever tried are the
essence mascaras there I heart line is
wonderful and vanity lash princess line
is fantastic there's a different color
lash princess I think one's more
waterproof together I'm not really sure
but they both do the exact same thing
for me I don't know I just love essence
mascaras so definitely check out essence
the next time you are at Ulta
number nine is makeup geek makeup geek
you can only buy on the makeup geek
website but they have some stellar
standout products their eyeshadows are
wonderful I especially like the foiled
eyeshadows that they have but even their
maps are really really good just all of
their eyeshadows are great they do have
a few palettes but I haven't invested in
any of those I've only ever gotten them
in singles and of course there's a weird
this isn't set up to use as a palette
it's just my makeup geek singles and
they're just fantastic really great
quality the foiled shadows are just so
shiny and wonderful I really enjoy them
a lot also the makeup geek highlighters
are really really good the glow on them
is kind of like a medium to pop glow
they're not super super shiny which is
great for people with larger pores but
they do give you a nice glow with a nice
pop and lasting power is really good on
me so definitely recommend these as well
number eight is julep Angeles doesn't
yet I don't think nearly enough hype
julep makes my favorite nail polishes of
all time I have been subscribed to a
subscription box for ever I do
skip probably at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the
boxes because who needs that much nail
polish I already have a stupid amount of
nail pumps they don't really need as
many nail polishes as they're sending at
this point but they're really really
really good polishes overall not every
colors but I would say 80 to 90% of the
polishes last on me at least 5 or 6 days
before they start chipping this shade
here is called Paulette it's kind of a
pinky purple with a yellow shift and
then this here is called Danielle and
it's just kind of a vibrant blue with a
little bit of a purple shift in it and
one of the big reasons why I love julep
is that the shades are so unique you'll
be able to find shades that you cannot
get anywhere else except for maybe some
other indie brands because there's some
indie brands that make some really
unique shades but mainstream brands
don't make shades like this the
individual polish prices are very pricey
but there's a trick to it what you do is
you sign up for their julep maven
program if you can remember set an alarm
on your phone to skip the months of the
box that you don't want and then you get
their monthly grab bag of items it is
like $30 I think I think it's $30 and
you get over $100 worth of nail polish
makeup and skincare and every time I get
stuff that I love they'll usually show
you a couple of products that are going
to be in the mystery box and they're
amazing I like the mystery boxes better
than I like the subscription you get
more bang for your buck and it's just a
fabulous way to stock up on some really
good products speaking of julep makeup
very underrated the julep lipsticks
these are called it's balm lip crayons
and there's two different packaging I
think it's the exact same formula though
I have Mary berry and almond nude cream
they have this core in the center you
can't see on that one let me open this
one they have this core in the center
it's like a hydrating core and they just
make them very smooth to go on very
hydrating very opaque they glass like
typical lipsticks they don't have any
kind of insane lasting power but they
feel really good on the
and they're beautiful in shade and I
really like them a lot the next brand is
a brush brand and my favorite brushes
that they've made recently are the
prismatic brushes you can get these at
Walmart they're about 20 bucks for the
entire set you get a bunch of brushes
they're beautiful they're worked really
well they're very very soft the way that
I clean them is I just put some soap in
my hands I make a little cup in my hand
and I just rub it like this I also have
like some of those brush cleaners that
are like solid I'll rub the brush like
this I'll put some water in my hand and
then I'll just rub like this and that's
the way that I clean them but these are
really really good the regular Moto's
are also very good as well as the Moto
metallic to me they're just different
handles the Moto regular line is a
little bit heavier so if you like
heavier you'll probably want to go with
the regular Mota
but the metallics I feel like have that
little pizazz of glamorous that's
because they're kind of sparkly and
pretty as far as quality they seem to be
the same to me they don't shed for me of
course if you wash them facing this way
they are going to be damaged to make
sure you're washing your brushes with
the ferrule facing down so that you
don't damage your bristles there's some
brush shapes that I like better than
some of the other ones but overall just
a fantastic brush brand
number six is Oprah cosmetics and Oprah
is an amazing brand for liquid lipsticks
I feel like they are the best of both
worlds when it comes to comfort and
lasting power they're not the most
comfortable liquid lipsticks ever and
they're not the most lasting power
liquid lipsticks ever but they meet very
nicely in the middle because the ones
that have very good lasting power to me
are not comfortable the ones that are
very comfortable don't have good lasting
power so these really nicely meet in the
middle this is actually the mani MUA
collection no matter what you want to
say about that man if you do not like
him that's fine but the man could pick
out some colors that's what I'm saying
this is hypno this is charmed and this
is Aries and I really love all of these
shades especially charmed charmed is
probably my favorite hypno I really like
to Aries I use as a topper with other
shades or two ombre in the middle of
other shades because it is a little bit
light for me I'm not sure if I really
like it on its own but it does have a
function in my life and they just are
beautiful in their formula the shade
rays they have is ridiculous the
metallic ones that they have are
wonderful and it's just a really great
formula I love them also from Oprah are
there highlighters highlighters are
fabulous this one is Beverly Hills and
this one is Rodeo Drive really poppy
from space highlighters if you like
those really Instagram
Jaclyn ho glowy looking highlighters
Oprah is the way to go makeup because a
little more calm these are like popping
Wow your cheeks are on fire but not
really they're just super glowy that's
what you're going to get with Oprah so
just really really good quality products
and you can now buy them online at Ulta
which i think is awesome
next up is my favorite skincare brand
and that is Paula's choice I did a
sponsor video for Paula's Choice a long
time ago I do want to say that but ever
since then I have been hooked these are
two of my favorite products from their
line this is the resist skin firming
line minimizer and this is the resist
weekly resurfacing treatment with
glycolic acid this is an exfoliant a
liquid exfoliant and oh my goodness I
haven't been using them because I'm
testing another skincare brand that I'm
not going to tell you yet which one it
is but I'm testing another skincare
brand and I have seen a significant
increase in the wrinkles on my forehead
since I stopped using this polish toy
stuff and I am about to lose my
exclusive deleted because I just I I
don't want to use this brand anymore
because it's not working for me and I
want to go back to my polish choice but
I have another skincare brand I want to
try after that so I like look at these
and go baby I miss you I want to come
back just wait for my baby I'll be
coming back I can't wait to go back
using them it's just a fantastic line
their anti-aging line everyone's skin is
different I have heard some people that
Polish choice does not work for based on
the comments under my videos I would say
80% of the comments are positive about
Polish choice for 20% or not so I don't
know whether you are in the 80 or the 20
but it's definitely something I would
recommend checking out they do have a
customer service number that you can
call and you tell them there your
concerns and then they recommend
products to you which I also think is
fantastic and of course cruelty free
which is also awesome
next is a brand that I have never once
heard about on YouTube never never
except for from the person who created
it these are Anki Mickey lashes by
Sabrina they're wonderful lashes there
are my favorite lashes I've tried a
bunch of different lash brands recently
and I keep going back to my inking
mickey's I love them they're so great my
only complaint about inky Mickey's is
they don't have a lot of really natural
lashes I go for our Del's for my natural
lashes but these are like your bold
crazy ones I'm wearing right now it's a
secret one they're very very spiky I
constantly get compliments on the is a
secret ones when I wear them I also
really like the in the mood ones these
are a little bit more wild and I haven't
tried the 10 p.m. ones yet these are
these are scary for me this is beyond my
comfort zone I'm terrified to wear these
I think they're going to look ridiculous
but we're going to try them eventually
one day when I'm wearing these crazy bat
lashes
you'll be like Oh Jen tried out the
Yankee minke ten pm mm-hmm but anyway
definitely recommend checking these out
and also you're supporting a small
business and youtuber so that's pretty
awesome too
we're going to go the exact opposite for
number three this is a brand that is
very hyped on YouTube but I feel like
they deserve 100% of their hype and that
is honest avi of Beverly Hills I have
realized recently how much I love on
Pascha I didn't realize it until I
started looking at all my favorite
products like vas Anasazi I'm not
Anasazi uh that's on the Saudi and man
do they do anything badly because I'm
really really enjoying them if there's
anything Romanus hacia that you don't
like I would love to know about it
because I want to avoid it because right
now I just want to buy everything so the
modern renaissance palette of course is
an ultra popular palette of course not
everybody is going to like it if you
don't like warm tones you're not going
to like it I'm sure you've seen this
before if you've watched youtube videos
you've seen this before
but in case you haven't it's very very
warm to them but this is one of the
easiest Telus I've ever worked with
it just they blend so seamlessly into
each other and the lasting power is
fantastic I love the shimmer and the
shimmers I love the mats and the mess
it's just a really good eyeshadow
palette also their contour palette is
fantastic they make this in so many
different shades which i think is
something that's very stand out about
Anasazi is they really take into account
a lot of different skin tones this one
that I have is light to medium and it's
perfect for me and I mostly use this
shake here for contouring and then I use
these two here for setting my under eye
depending on whether I have darker
circles or not I'll use one or the other
and then this one's just a very mild
highlight here so really really great
quality lasting power it's wonderful
easy to blend easy to use all of that
the packaging is a little bit I don't
know what's going on with my packaging
but I don't care if the products
fantastic
number two getting into the lows of my
life coloured raine is number two
coloured raine okay I know some people
are very mad about the Queen of Hearts
palette and if you don't know why people
are mad about the Queen of Hearts
palette it's because this was sold out
forever this is a wonderful eyeshadow
palette the quality of this is insane
how good this eyeshadow palette is it
was sold out forever they said it was
coming back for a very limited rerelease
people jumped on it is sold out super
fast people were really upset that they
didn't get the purchases so coloured
raine decided they were going to
manufacture them so that they could be
permanent but then the internet erupted
with anger because it was supposed to be
a limited-edition palette and now it's
not going to be limited edition it's
permanent I feel like coloured raine
couldn't do anything to make everybody
happy at that point they could either
continue to produce this palette that
everybody loves so that everybody can
have one or they can hold it up on their
word as limited edition either way
there's going to be people that are
upset the fortune is saying is if you
can get over you're upset and irritation
with that they said this Mississippi
limit edition this is an incredible eye
shadow palette it's really really
wonderful I can't wait to see what color
rains going to come out with next 4
eyeshadow palettes because this is knock
out of the park amazing there's only one
shade in here that's a little difficult
to work with and it's this one here it's
called ladyship I do have a full review
of this toilet with an eye look I'll
link that down below in case you want to
check it out
they also have excellent liquid
lipsticks these are a little more on the
drying side compared to the Oprah's but
the lasting power is a little bit better
the shine on this one here is so good
this one's called Empire it's beautiful
and then this one here is kind of a cool
toned it's called marshmallow I really
love both of them I love the way they
look on my lips they're fantastic
and if there's no other brands that you
were going to try out of all of these
brands this is the one that I feel like
you need to try and it is incidences uh
julius place the quality of these
products is insane especially for the
price they are ridiculously affordable
for what you get for the price point
these are the best i shadow z' i have
ever used
i like these just as much as my busy are
eye shadows i like them just as much as
my natasha to Nona shadows and i
actually find them a little bit easier
to work with the midrash angelo an eye
shadows they're so good they're so so
good and this is how good they are I
have all of these and I love them and
they're coming they came out with a
blush palette that I just ordered off of
Haute look I haven't tried that yet but
what I have tried is the eyeliners the
eyeliners are wonderful I'm not sure if
they are still selling these or not but
if they are I definitely recommend these
as well they're very creamy to go on
they're very easy to use or gel format
and they're they're really really good
but the standout product to me is
definitely the eyeshadows I will link my
