challenge wait did you see are you
recording oh hi welcome to my channel
this fabulous challenge was invented by
in my opinion the original beauty guru
makeup geek TV I started watching her
back in 2004-2005 something crazy they
haven't ever seen marlenas channel check
it out i'll put a link down below
marlena created the two men makeup
challenge and the challenge is do a
makeup look in two minutes from nothing
to B utiful and two minutes is not a lot
of time but this is a look that I came
up with I don't think it's too bad for
two minutes if you want to see how I got
this look stay tuned alright so here's
the game plan we're to start off with
some Revlon age-defying concealer then
we're going to move on to the Rimmel
stay matte with my Real Techniques brush
it's a blush brush but I don't like for
blush it's not thick enough it's not um
it's too heavy then we're going to move
on to my mini tart cheek stain and flush
then we're going to move on to the wet
and wild comfort zone palette and I'm
going to be using this one this brow
bone one and then this crease one and
I'm going to be using going to be using
my eco tools brushes for those these are
from the eye shadow kit I've got the big
fatty I've got the angled crease and
then I've got the blending one then
we'll be moving on to the Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper and the benefit
they're real mascara the reason why I
chose this one is because it goes on
very quickly and it provides a really
really fast line though they're real
mascara is insane from the first sweep
so if I even just get a couple sweeps on
there I think
good to go if i have time which i
probably won't i'm going to be going
into doing my brows because i do have
some spaces in my brows that I don't
like so that will be if i have time if I
have even more time than that then I'm
going to be doing some outer V stuff
with the darkest brown here oh we shall
see what happens okay I'm ready okay got
my handy dandy iphone and we are going
to start the two minutes and I did I
chose not to do the Prada I primer
because I didn't want that extra step I
think I might use Anna will fly with it
i think i'm going to use it all over my
eye because I I don't like the shade of
my eyelids so until I shouldn't even
open it I'm not gonna cheat I am going
to open it two minutes is really fast we
will say all right ready set go
15 seconds now set this I'm gonna D
shine upon my face 30 seconds in love
this stuff for quick splash is amazing
for quick mix your matches oh all right
eye shadow oh yeah not all this is
heaven and 50 seconds left where my
eyeliner go there when I want all right
I gotta get clothes for this sorry guys
you will be able to see my master Thomas
oh my gosh made your major fail there 30
seconds left I will fix that a five-time
think I'm gonna have time
to fix it listen I've to choose between
the brows and fixing my line or my fix
my liner cuz I totally failed on that
I do not bring anything for lips alright
wrapped it I'm gonna give myself two
extra seconds gonna drop down for lips
done and that is the finished look
that's not bad unhappy that I got a kind
of rub that little mistake over there
yeah so obviously I kind of cheated a
little bit because of me dropping the
blush and then applying it on my lips
very quickly after the two minutes ended
I guess I'm kind of you know because of
that if I hadn't dropped that I would
have had time to just go right right
right and it would have been fine also
if I had been smart enough to leave the
caps off of things then I would have had
more time to if i had had another minute
I would have done my brows I don't enjoy
the way my brows look right now I would
put on a little bit more mascara I would
have done a lip gloss cuz I love lip
gloss um and I probably would have put a
little more cheek color on because now
I've watched it and it looks like in the
mirror it looked a lot like I had more
blush on than it does on camera but yeah
