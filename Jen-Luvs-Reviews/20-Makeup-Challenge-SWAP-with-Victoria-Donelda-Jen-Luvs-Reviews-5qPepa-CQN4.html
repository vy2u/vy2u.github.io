improved $20 makeup challenge I am so
excited to do this video because I could
do it with my friend
Victoria's I know that Who I am
absolutely in love with in all the right
ways that are appropriate being a
married woman that I am
if you don't know Victoria's channel I
strongly suggest you check her out she
is amazing but if curse words bother you
you might not want to head over there
but if they don't bother you I bet you
will love her I did do the 20 on makeup
challenge a couple of years ago where i
purchased the product myself it was a
complete disaster my makeup looked like
hell like it was bad it looked really
bad so I saw this on I think it was
beauty to shoes that she had done this
with someone and I copied her idea
basically what you do is you buy the
twenty dollars and makeup for somebody
else and then all they have to work with
other products that you purchase for
them so that way it's kind of off my
shoulders if it sucks it's all on
Victoria and for hers she's gonna be
doing the twenty dollar makeup challenge
as well with the product products that I
purchased for her but this is one thing
we definitely agreed to in the very
beginning we said we are gonna make this
an honest review like you know with you
like you do a SWOT with somebody you
gotta say everything's awesome because
somebody purchase it for you you know
I'm saying but Victoria and I agreed
that it's okay to say the product sucks
so don't think she's gonna be mad at me
if I say one of these products did not
work for me she's gonna do the same
thing and trash the products that I said
her if she doesn't like Victoria sent me
this envelope full of goodies and then
she sent me this nice note and what she
did was she gave me like a little cheat
sheet on the back of you know what she
was thinking okay so I think I'm pretty
sure she wants me to start with this
this is the hard candy glamoflauge light
concealer now we tried really hard to
actually buy good quality products for
each other and I've heard a lot of
things about this product and I don't
own it so I'm really excited to try it
and I don't know exactly what light
means when it comes to a concealer maybe
it's just not as heavy all now
enough you guys can see there's that
side and this side apply corrector to
blemishes layer on concealer shade to
blend okay I don't thankfully don't have
any blemishes right now I do have a
little bit of probably stuff a little
bit of scarring there from some
blemishes I had not too long ago but how
do I know which sides which it does not
say this one looks closer to my skin
tone so I'm just gonna go ahead and use
this oh and the other thing we decided
is we're not going to count tools as
part of the $20 because it just makes it
a little more doable not using the
actual product just using the mirror
people so let's just kind of cover my
dark circles a bit going on pretty
creamy but covering the dark circles
pretty well and the discolorations cut
being covered pretty well like that it's
actually pretty nice a little bit of
creasing but yeah looks good okay got a
couple of acne scars a little bit of
redness on my chin what we learned was
that with the $20 makeup challenge it's
really hard to find foundation that's
cheap enough so I'm sure she got this
concealer in lieu of foundation oh no
how's that looking looking pretty good
let's go ahead and move on okay now she
got me yay she got me the Milani
multitasker face powder in media do not
own this and I'm excited to try it
it's all fancy with the swirl of swirl
is boom and then there's a little mirror
and a little spongy here I don't know
should I use the little spongey we'll
use it just for good measure because it
came with it and this is the $20 makeup
challenge folks but this stuff is nice
look at that look at the difference can
you guys see the difference there just
put it on the right side of my face you
guys can see
good that nice good choice Victoria well
done I'm looking over at my monitor now
a lot of people ask me why do I always
look over there cuz I can see myself
over there that's why I look I put on my
eyelid on that side accidentally so I
got put on the other side now so we
match that looks good oh I'm gonna be
using this all the time oh I'm excited
about this product
nice one okay so next up let's go into I
shadow this eye shadow actually use
products from this line before I'm not
sure if this is the exact same one that
I've used before but this is the NYC HD
color trio eyeshadow and I was not a fan
of the one that I've used before so
hopefully this one's a little bit better
they're very neutral colors Victoria
knows how much I love my neutral colors
I got her a bunch of purples because I
know how she likes the bright color she
knows how much I like the neutral so I'm
not sure about these so that's how those
swatched so I think I'm going to do this
for the lid that for the crease and that
for the brow bone
um I don't really see much of a
difference between this and my eye color
on my eye color my eyelid color okay
we're gonna rewind sound like that me
okay I'm gonna take a risk and I'm gonna
use this on my lids as a primer and
hopefully that'll help the shadow to
stick a little bit better
I like this pen format here and this is
pretty nice
alright hopefully that meet but will
create a little bit of contrast and
you'll be able to see the eye shadow a
little bit better hopefully let's try
this again I'm gonna go back into the
bottom shade and this is just a plain
regular old domed shader brush and this
one I don't even know who is by mystery
brand they're all pretty much the same
as long as they don't poke your they'll
work okay I think that looks a little
bit better you can really see the
contrast a little bit better
definitely muy bueno okay now we're
gonna go into the crease with the middle
color oh that's super pigmented I'm
shocked at how pigmented that is see you
see that's like super dark I'm gonna
blend it later no worries no worries try
this side
nice and this is a fantastic crease
brush by Coastal Scents and it is the
BRC n09
all right I'm just gonna blend this out
just a little bit ooh that really is
nice and pigmented that was easy to
blend too I'm shocked all right and then
this is my go-to blending brush for my
my highlight and how I blend out my
crease color and this is by Real
Techniques and it is the deluxe crease
brush I don't actually put it in my
crease I just use it to blend up I like
it because it's so dense I can really
get color packed on there and it really
can pull at my skin I know you're
supposed to pull your eye skin but it
really pulls at it so that they can
really blend the color out and you know
what hugs on to the skin so I'm gonna
blend that baby out nice this actually
it's coming out pretty good I'm shocked
okay very nice what y'all thinking so
far I mean it's a pretty it's a very
neutral eye look I'm gonna use this this
is also by no this is actually an urban
decay brush this is an urban decay
blending brush I don't use this very
often but I really want to pack some
color up into the deepest part of my
crease to kind of really create that
contrast I'm just kind of working that
very gently just right into the deepest
part of my crease normally I would put a
little bit deeper of a color but it's a
trio so it only came with three but I
think you know it's still a really nice
tree I mean if you're looking for like a
you know like an everyday work school
look especially if you're like younger
and you don't want to look like you're
wearing a ton of makeup to school this
is a way to do it or if you have a very
conservative job this would be great I
do feel like it accentuates any
creepiness I have on my lids the huh I
know I don't have a ton of it but a
little bit I mean I can really see it
with the shimmers in here and without
any matte colors to really soften it up
I'm kind of
not really gonna get too much better
there okay it looks like we've got a
brown pencil I think the purpose of this
was a dual brow pencil and eyeliner
we'll try this out and this is by NYC
and this is the Cola brow eyeliner
pencil the fact that it's cold gives me
hope because usually those are a bit
softer for liner sometimes they'll stick
in my brows but I'm definitely not gonna
be picky for this I'll tell you that
let's see let's do the brows first cuz
I'm sure those will look alike they need
some hail okay actually that's actually
working pretty nicely actually I mean I
can feel it sticking just a tiny bit but
it's not bad for an inexpensive product
it's not bad at all and you'll see
what's happening here I'm all hunched
over let me sit up straight like a real
beauty guru because beauty gurus don't
go like this I've faked this well or
maybe not so well it seemed we were
pigmented let me swatch this on my hand
let's see I mean it's pretty light I
don't know how this is gonna work for an
eyeliner for me we'll see all right hmm
usually if I wear brown eyeliner usually
it's darker so we're gonna see how this
goes
okay it's not really catching well I
mean a tiny bit I could see it a little
bit that's not really doing a whole lot
can you even see that I don't know I
can't see it like sitting here under the
lights I can't really see it thank we
should give me an awesome-ass garrison
what is happen
that's so weird I've been watching too
much supernatural lately I figure
there's a ghost in my house goes to some
makeup artist I'm gonna get me yeah this
is not functional at all this is not
even this is not working I'll do the
other eye just in case it's doing
something but this is not a good pencil
at all so this is the first big bust of
the item is Victoria gave me y'all see
way more than I can in this little tiny
monitor and this little tiny mirror
y'all see about a 19 but I think it did
pretty welcome eyebrows but it is a big
no for eyeliner so it's a nice try but
that did not work out okay next up we'll
do the mascara and she got me the
Jordana fast lash extreme and I have
seen this in so many videos and I have
never used it so you do not know how
excited I am to try this so there is the
wand they're very short bristles they're
spread apart kind of far not too far
though on they seem like they're pretty
no no they're not they're not plasticky
but their mascara bristles it doesn't
look too goopy on the end which is a
good thing oh let me down Jordana live
up to the height baby come up
oh you seeing this oh this is a good one
yup everything I hoped it would be
Wow Victoria you did good look at the
difference through my eyelashes
seriously that is some craziness totally
living up to the hype right now Jordanna
just a little bit of clumping but not a
deal-breaker worth of clumping totally
save my eye look and I was thinking that
it might okay let's give it another coat
all right I'm just gonna give another
coat and I'm gonna come right back so
there you go that's two coats of the
Jordanna best best lash extreme totally
completely in love with this mascara as
I thought I would be man last we've got
some lipstick and this is by NYC and as
the expert last color and she said she
really likes this that she doesn't have
this color but she got some other colors
and she really liked him so see how it
goes I'm gonna try to double this up as
a blush
mmm that feels nice that matches my
sweat um kind of clinging to my dry
spots I should have exfoliated first it
feels really nice it feels moisturizing
a tad bit heavy has a mild fruity sense
I don't like that it clings to my dry
spots a bit but if I exfoliate properly
I'm sure we'll be fine
you ready to see this if this works this
is a blush let's say mm-hmm that's it
cream blush time I should have put it on
before the powder look at that hey that
worked pretty darn well mm-hmm
sure did yep
that worked pretty well I am impressed
I'm not looking to y'all is that looking
to y'all as good as this looking to me I
think that looks awesome
something y'all says some of my favorite
subscribe to tell me I don't yell it up
so I'm yelling as video girlfriends oh I
wanted to add a little bit of color on
my lower lash line real quick because I
feel like it's kind of lacking there now
that I'm looking at it I just want to do
a little bit there I'm drawing on a ball
I don't usually use this brush for lower
lash line but I'm lazy don't feel like
getting another fish
wow this blows my $20 makeup challenge
that I did a year ago out of the
stinking water I think it looks really
good considering that all these products
were bought for $20 or under I don't
know the exact value because I've an
asset Toria yet but I think she did
pretty darn good and I think I'm
actually gonna be able to film like this
like I was playing around having to beef
up my my makeup but I don't think I'm
gonna have to knowing I might do is just
add a different liner eyeliner so for
$20 Victoria sends me new hard candy
glamoflauge light and that's the dual
ended stick and this one is in medium
light she sent me the Milani face powder
in medium the multitasker face powder
she sent me the NYC HD color trio
eyeshadow in long beach sands I don't
think if I mentioned that before Jordana
best lash extreme and then she got me
the Cole Brown brow eyeliner pencil yes
in taupe and she sent me the NYC expert
last lips color in number 4 for 6 smooch
and Victoria I was with you I would just
smooch you right on the cheek and get
you some pink little lippy prints on
your cheek because you're amazing and
you did so good with this and I also
should mention the victorious sent a few
of these caramel apple lollipops that
she said are her favorite and they have
to be one of my favorites as well and
they will be shared with the fam she set
one for each of us one for me one for
John one for Lila and one for a little
John so very excited to have some of
that thank you so much a Victoria for
sending me all of this wonderful makeup
I think you did a fantastic job
girlfriend at picking out the stuff
because if you ever try to do the 20 no
makeup challenge you'll understand how
difficult how difficult it is to
actually buy a whole face wear the
makeup for 20 dollars it is very
difficult make sure you check out

bought for her so if you're interested
