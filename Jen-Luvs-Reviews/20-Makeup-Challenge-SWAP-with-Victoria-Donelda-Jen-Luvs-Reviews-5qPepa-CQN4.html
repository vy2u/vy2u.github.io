improved $20 makeup challenge I am so
excited to this video because I could do
it with my friend Victoria died now that
who I am absolutely in love with in all
the right ways that are appropriate
being a married woman that I am if you
don't know Victoria's channel I strongly
suggest you check her out she is amazing
but if curse words bother you you might
not want to head over there but if they
don't bother you I bet you will love her
I did do the twat now my makeup
challenge a couple of years ago where I
purchased the product myself it was a
complete disaster my makeup looked like
hell like it was bad it looked really
bad so I saw this on I think it was
beauty two shoes that she had done this
with someone and I copied her idea
basically what you do is you by the
twenty dollars and makeup for somebody
else and then all they have to work with
other products that you purchased for
them so that way it's cut off my
shoulders if it sucks it's all on
Victoria and for hers she's going to be
doing the twenty-dollar makeup challenge
as well with the product products that i
purchased for her but this is one thing
we definitely agreed to in the very
beginning we said we are gonna make this
an honest review like you know when do
you like you do a swap with somebody you
gotta say everything's awesome because
somebody parks before you you know I'm
saying but Victoria and I agreed that
it's okay to say the product sucks so
don't think she's gonna be mad at me if
I say one of these products did not work
for me she's gonna do the same thing and
trash the products that i sent her if
she doesn't like victoria sent me this
envelope full of goodies and then she
sent me this nice note and what she did
was she gave me like a little cheat
sheet on the back of you know what she
was thinking ok so i think i'm pretty
sure she wants me to start with this
this is the hard candy glama flage light
concealer now we tried really hard to
actually buy good quality products for
each other and I've heard a lot of
things about this product and I don't
own it so I'm really excited to try it
and I don't know exactly what light
means when it comes to a concealer maybe
it's just not as heavy all know enough
you
eyes can see there's that side and this
side apply corrector to blemishes layer
on concealer shade to blend okay I don't
thankfully don't have any blemishes
right now I do have a little bit of
probably stuff a little bit of scarring
there from some blemishes I had not too
long ago but how do i know which sides
which it does not say this one looks
closer my skin tone so I'm just going to
go ahead and use this oh and the other
thing we decided is we're not going to
count tools as part of the twenty
dollars because it just makes it a
little more doable not using the actual
product just using the mirror people so
let's just kind of cover my dark circles
a bit going on pretty creamy but
covering the dark circles pretty well
and the discolorations cut being covered
pretty well like that it's actually
pretty nice a little bit of creasing but
yeah looks good okay got a couple of
acne scars a little bit of redness on my
chin corona what we learned was that
with the twin our makeup challenge it's
really hard to find foundation it's
cheap enough so I'm sure she got this
concealer in lieu of foundation oh no
how's that looking looking pretty good
let's go ahead and move on okay now she
got me yay she got me the Milani
multitasker face powder in media do not
own this ah and I'm excited to try it
it's all fancy with the swirl of swirl
is ooh and then there's a little mirror
and a little spongy here I don't know
should I use a little spongy will use it
just for good measure because it came
with it and this is the twenty-dollar
makeup challenge folks know this stuff
is nice look at that look at the
difference can you guys see the
difference there just put it on the
right side of my face you guys can see
good that nice good choice Victoria well
done I'm looking over at my monitor now
a lot of people ask me why do I always
look over there cuz I can see myself
over there that's why I look I put on my
eyelid on that side accidentally so I
got put on the other side now so we
match that looks good whew i'm gonna be
using this all the time oh I'm excited
about this product nice one okay so next
up let's go into I shadow this eyeshadow
actually use products from this line
before I'm not sure if this is the exact
same one that I've used before but this
is the NYC HD color trio eyeshadow and I
was not a fan of the one that I'd used
before so hopefully this one's a little
bit better they're very neutral colors
Victoria knows how much I love my
neutral colors I got her a bunch of
purples because I know how she likes the
bright colors she knows how much I like
the neutral so I'm not sure about these
so that's how those swatched so i think
i'm going to do this for the lid that
for the crease and that for the brow
bone
um I don't really see much of a
difference between this and my eye color
on my eye color my eyelid color okay
we're gonna rewind sound like that me
okay I'm gonna take a risk and I'm going
to use this all my lids as a primer and
hopefully that will help the shadow to
stick a little bit better I like this
pen format here and this is pretty nice
alright hopefully that meat but will
create a little bit of contrast you'll
be able to see the eye shadow a little
bit better hopefully let's try this
again I'm going to go back into the
bottom shade and this is just a plain
regular old dome shader brush and this
one I don't even know who is by mystery
bran they're all pretty much the same as
long as they don't poke your they'll
work okay I think that looks a little
bit better you can really see the
contrast a little bit better definitely
muy bueno okay now we're going to go
into the crease with the middle color
blue that's super pigmented I'm shocked
at how pigmented that is cec that's like
super dark I'm gonna blend it later no
worries no worries try the Sun
nice and this is a fantastic crease
brush by Coastal Scents and it is the
BRC and 09 all right I'm just gonna
blend this out just a little bit ooh
that really is nice and pigmented that
was easy to blend to I'm shocked all
right and then this is my go-to blending
brush for my my highlight and how I
blend out my crease color this is by
Real Techniques and it is the deluxe
crease brush I don't actually put it in
my crease I just use it to blend up I
like it because it's so dense I can
really get color packed on there and it
really can pull at my skin I know you're
supposed to pull your eyes skin but it
really pulls at it so that they can
really blend the color out it you know
it hugs on to the skin so I'm gonna
blend that baby out nice this actually
is coming out pretty good I'm shop okay
very nice were y'all thinking so far I
mean it's a pretty it's a very neutral I
look I'm going to use this this is also
by know this is actually an urban decay
brush this is an urban decay blending
brush I don't use this very often but i
really want to pack some color up into
the deepest part of my priests to kind
of really create that contrast I'm just
kind of working that very gently just
right into the deepest part of my crease
normally I would put a little bit deeper
of a color but it's a trio so it only
came with the three but i think you know
it's still a really nice tree i mean if
you're looking for like a you know like
an everyday work school look especially
if you're like younger and you don't
want to look like you're wearing a ton
of makeup to school this is a way to do
it or if you have a very conservative
job this would be great i do feel like
it accentuates any creepiness i have on
my lids the huh i know i don't have a
ton of it but a little bit i mean i can
really see it with the shimmers in here
and without any matte colors to really
soften it up I'm kind of
not really gonna get too much better
there okay it looks like we've got a
brown pencil I think the purpose of this
was a dual brow pencil and eyeliner
we'll try this out and this is by NYC
and this is the cola brow eyeliner
pencil the fact that it's cold gives me
hope because usually those are a bit
softer for liner sometimes they'll stick
in my brows but I'm definitely not gonna
be picky for this I'll tell you that
let's see let's do the Browns first cuz
i'm sure those are looking like they
need some hail okay actually that's
actually working pretty nicely actually
I mean I can feel it sticking just a
tiny bit but it's not bad for an
inexpensive product it's not bad at all
you'll see what's happening here I'm all
hunched over let me sit up straight like
a real beauty guru cuz beauty good
result go like this oh I faked this well
or maybe not so well no no it doesn't
seem a pig method let me swatch this on
my hand see I mean it's pretty light I
don't know how this is gonna work for an
eyeliner for me we'll see all right hmm
usually if I wear brown eyeliner usually
it's darker so we're gonna see how this
goes
okay it's not really catching well I
mean a tiny bit I could see a little bit
that's not really doing a whole lot can
you even see that I don't know I can't
see it like sitting here under the
lights I can't really see it Thank we
should give me an awesome ass garrison
what is habitable my life that's so
weird I've been watching too much
supernatural lately I figure there's a
ghost two miles goes to some makeup
artist coming to get me yeah this is not
functional at all this is not even this
is not working I'll do the other eye
just in case it's doing something but
this is not a good pencil at all so this
is the first big bust of the items
Victoria gave me y'all see way more than
I can in this little tiny monitor and
the little tiny mirror y'all see about
an idea but I think I did pretty well
for my brows but it is a big no for
eyeliner so it's a nice try but that did
not work out ok next up we'll do the
mass era and she got me the Jordana bass
/ extreme and I have seen this in so
many videos and I have never used it so
you do not know how excited I am to try
this so there is the wand they're very
short bristles they're spread apart kind
of far not too far though on they seem
like they're pretty oh no they're not
they're not plasticky but their mascara
bristles it doesn't look too goopy on
the end which is a good thing don't let
me down Jordana live up to the hype baby
como
oh you seeing this oh this is a good one
yup everything I hoped it would be Wow
Victoria you did good look at the
difference to my eyelashes seriously
that is some craziness totally living up
to the hype right now Jordana just a
little bit of clumping but not a
deal-breaker worth of clumping totally
save my I look and I was thinking that
it might okay let's give it another coat
all right I'm just gonna give another
coat and I'm gonna come right back so
there you go that's two codes to the
Jordana best best / extreme totally
completely in love with this mascara as
I thought I would be man last we've got
some lipstick and this is by NYC and is
the expert last color and she said she
really likes this that she doesn't have
this color but she got some other colors
and she really liked him so see how it
goes i'm gonna try to double this up as
a blush
mmm would that feels nice and matches my
swept um kind of clinging to my dry
spots i should have exfoliated first it
feels really nice it feels moisturizing
a tad bit heavy has a mild fruity scent
I don't like that it clings to my dry
spots a bit but if i exfoliate properly
i'm sure we'll be fine you ready to see
this this works as a blush let's say
mm-hmm that's it cream blush time haha
probably sure to put it on before the
powder look at that hey that we're
pretty darn well mm-hmm sure did you
know
that worked pretty well I am impressed
how's that looking to y'all is that
looking to y'all's goodness is looking
at me I think that looks awesome whoa
some of y'all says some of my favorite
subscribe to tell me I don't yell it up
so I'm yelling as video girlfriends oh I
wanted to add a little bit of color on
my lower lash line real quick because I
feel like it's kind of lacking there now
that I'm looking at it I just want to do
a little bit there I'm drawing wobble I
don't usually use this brush for lower
lash line but i'm lazy don't feel I get
another fish hmm wow this blows my
twenty dollar makeup challenge that I
did a year ago out of the stinking water
I think it looks really good considering
that all these products were bought for
twenty dollars or under I don't know the
exact value because I'm an ass Toria yet
but I think she did pretty darn good and
I think I'm actually gonna be able to
film like this like I was playing around
having to beef up my makeup but I don't
think I'm gonna have to knowing I might
do is just add a different line or
eyeliner so for twenty dollars Victoria
sends me me hard candy glama flage light
and that's the dual ended stick and this
one is in medium light she sent me the
Milani face powder in medium the
multitasker face powder she sent me the
NYC HD color trio eyeshadow in long
beach sands I don't think if I mentioned
that before Jordana best / extreme and
then she got me the coal brown brow
eyeliner pencil yes in taupe and she
sent me the NYC expert last lips color
in number four for six smooch and
Victoria I was I was with you I would
just smooch you right on the cheek and
get you some pink little lippy prints on
your cheek because you're amazing and
you did so good with this and I also
should mention the victorious sent a few
of these caramel apple lollipops as she
said or her favorite and they had
and to be one of my favorites as well
and they will be shared with the fam she
sent one for each of us one for me one
for JAMA for Lyla I want for a little
john so very excited to have some of
that thank you so much a Victoria for
sending me all of this wonderful makeup
I think you did a fantastic job
girlfriend at picking out the stuff
because if you ever try to do the 20 no
makeup challenge you'll understand how
difficult how difficult it is to
actually buy a whole face where the
makeup for twenty dollars it is very
difficult make sure you check out
