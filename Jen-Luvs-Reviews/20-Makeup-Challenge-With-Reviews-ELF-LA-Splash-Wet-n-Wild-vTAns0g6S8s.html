requested by that person it's my first
actual really real live video requests
from a really real live youtube
subscriber that I don't know outside of
YouTube how cool is that so long times
I've gotten one of those since I had my
old channel but anyway long story
everyone so anyway I was excited to do
this twine on makeup challenge it was a
lot harder than I thought it was going
to be um there are some issues that
happened during the 29 makeup challenge
there's also reviews of all the products
during the makeup challenge so check it
out here it comes them BAM okay so let's
do a little commentary on what happened
here in this year video now alright so I
got me elf flawless finish foundation
and I was a little confused about how to
open it i'm used to let covergirl and
stuff that her twist sauce uh yeah this
isn't a twist-off finally figure it out
and there you go it was a pop off and
you squirt it on your finger like a
little puppy pump alright so i'm putting
on this foundation and i'm noticing very
quickly that it is very very a lot of
coverage going on here I mean I almost
felt like I was a mannequin putting this
on just the coverage is insane so i
don't know if i need to use less of it
or what but um yeah I just thought the
coverage was kind of ridiculous on this
I'm it felt really heavy um okay anyway
enough about that because I'm moving on
in the video session
here this is the elf translucent
mattifying powder and I actually already
owned this for use with my maybelline
fit me foundation it made me super shiny
and this was a modified this mattifying
powder was the only thing that helped me
not be shiny from that stuff that fit me
powder did not work well at all for me
when I did get next was for the blush
and bronzer I got the contouring blush
and bronzer set from elf and putting
that on was really easy I actually
really liked putting them on it find it
really nicely it wasn't crazy with the
pilot at me I really liked how that
blended I'll probably actually use that
blush now here comes the bronzer and you
know it's so super pigmented and really
hard to blend I think I just ended up
rubbing most of it off I don't even know
if I really got to contour with the
stuff because I really probably rubbed a
lot of it off so and the second try I
really tried to use less of it and it
still didn't really work because it
didn't really blend the way I wanted it
to so I will most likely not be using
that bronzer again I tried to put some
of my temples to try anything happens
like I'm the super so super light sister
use this stuff and I barely even use it
on my other temple um because it's just
not even i'm just not enjoying it but i
thought that ninja balance things out so
here is the wet and wild poza cucumber
palette it says to use the lightest
color as brow bone color but i don't
like to use the dark colors on my lid
I think it makes them look like I got
punched in the face so I use the lighter
color now i'm using the darker green
color in my outer corner and I'm kind of
smudging that out with the little smushy
brush that we got there the little
whatever you call it a little I don't
even know what you want call that but
the typical brush you get with most
eyeshadows and if I'm pretty well it was
actually okay with that i have used one
is a minute so I was pretty impressed
with how that how that worked there like
that and the eyeshadows really blend in
nicely now i'm going to use just the
very tip of this goofy utensil that i
always throw away and i'm going to put
it just right in my crease and may that
nice sharp line and i'm going to try on
the other side but I don't think I
pressed it down hard enough to really
get the sharp line I got the first time
so it's just kind of go in there but
it's still going in really nicely i'm
actually very impressed with how this
eyeshadow blended i will definitely be
looking into buying more of these wet
and wild little palettes because they
weren't very expensive so i'm really
interested in those so i decided that my
outer corner needed a little more
darkening so i went back in with that
green and the outer corners just a kind
of dark enough alone
a little bit now i'm going to use that
purple and I thought about putting it on
my art Bolivia know where to put it so I
just decided to use it as a bottom
eyeliner there and I think it comes out
pretty nice I kind of see how that's
coming out there and they only wet like
half to three-quarters of the way over I
don't like bottom I like that goes all
the way across some yeah it looks a
little strange so I usually only go half
to three-quarters of the way over at the
very very most usually the two-thirds
maybe now here is the elf eyeliner
pencil that's obviously upside down
because I'm an idiot and didn't realize
it was upside down now I I've never used
this eyeliner before this is the first
time I'd used it and I had a little bit
of trouble applying this is like the
worst ever close up a portable eyeliner
our application please do not apply your
eyeliner than way of doing this now this
is not meant to be a tutorial at this
point at all they did a terrible job
with this eyeliner look at that big huge
space on my lid no know if you can see
that within my lash line today but now
I'm fixing it because it was a huge
giant space and it just looked terrible
so now I'm going into the other eye I
think the second i went a little better
than my first I I guess with practice
and went a little bit
better on the second I but the eyeliner
went on pretty smooth me it was actually
pretty impressed with it and I do out a
little bit of loose skin on my eyes so I
have to pull my eyelid a little bit kind
of just a flattened out that skin there
so it doesn't wrinkle a rumble and I
just put a little bit of the eyeliner on
a very very edge with my bottle lid now
this was the inspiration for the entire
look was when I found this la squash
eyeliner in purple heart and if this
really pretty spark look slightly
sparkly purple eyeliner but I noticed
that it is a little bit sheer so I
wanted to make sure I put it over a
black liner so that you could really see
the purple and not worry about a spotty
job like it look
it was by itself I did put a tiny bit
down in the bottom corner on match that
black that I used now here's the elf
mascara I never used this before either
overall I like the end result but I had
to speed this up like ridiculous because
it took like 150 passes to really get
this on the way I wanted it to it was
pretty buildable but it seemed to take
forever to get it to build up so this is
the final I look that I ended up with
I'm not super happy with a special on
that left eye but I'm going to fix it in
a minute so anyway now I realize that I
didn't buy anything for lips so this is
my free lip gloss right there makes it
nice and shiny not very pigmented but
you know you do what you gotta do
there's a final look there and you know
now I realize that I looked in the
mirror and I had this weird funky space
so I'm going to go ahead and fix that
because that was horribly ugly and again
this is not a tutorial that was terrible
eyeliner application there but I kind of
fixed it and it worked out okay which
was nice with the elf eyeliner alright
so that was the challenge hope you guys
liked it yeah um there were some issues
there the biggest one being that I
didn't buy any lip products for the
challenge so I guess that's like an epic
fail for showing my lip products
but you know I didn't have time to go
back to the store and fix the situation
so I just use the cheap lip gloss and
it's 20 bucks and go on a budget so you
just do what you gotta do and you know
let's face it most lip glosses and
lipsticks they come off after a lake
what 30 minutes anyway you got to
reapply them so you know that's what
you're gonna look like most thing anyway
so you might as well just lick it up and
gloss it up with the free stuff you know
what I'm sayin next up is reviews for my
beauty boxes then I got my subscriptions
I got uh I got Beauty bucks five I got
sample society and I got glam bag those
