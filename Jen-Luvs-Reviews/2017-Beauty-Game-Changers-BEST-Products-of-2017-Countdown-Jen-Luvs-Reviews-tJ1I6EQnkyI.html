channel today we're gonna be going over
the top 10 products I tried in 2017 I
went through all my review videos all my
favorites and fails videos I went
through my drawers and I looked through
everything I tried this year and I've
got it narrowed down to 10
top 10 things that I tried in 2017 I
can't wait to share them with you hang
tight we're getting into it right now if
you followed me on my 2017 journey you
know how many products I tried this year
a lot a stupid amount of products oh it
was very difficult for me to choose a
top 10 but I did it I was able to do it
and I can't wait to share it with you I
do want to let you know that down in the
description box below i will put
purchase links for things anything that
you want to know where to get it
also I will put an asterisk next to any
items that I was sent by the brand I
don't think anything in here was a
sponsored video no nothing here was a
sponsored video the only thing is that
some of them were sent to me for review
purposes but I wasn't paid to try any of
this so without further ado let's get to
number 10 Wow number 10 I was so excited
about because these were actually
created by my friend Shani over at total
make up Johnny junkie 101 these are the
Ronnie cosmetics lipsticks I am so proud
of Shani for coming up with this idea
because well she didn't come up with it
apparently there's a lot of makeup in
India that is like this ishani was
totally ahead of the trend on this
bringing this concept to the United
States
these are glitter lipsticks and the
glitter is embedded within the lipstick
this is a fantastic formula it doesn't
feel gritty on the lips at all but you
can definitely see the shine I did do a
full review of this with swatches of all
of the colors on my lips I will link
that down below in case you want to see
all of them but I've really been
enjoying these a lot they have changed a
little bit in texture since I got them
in that they are not quite as creamy as
when I first got them but that doesn't
seem to be affecting the wear at all the
wear on these is wonderful and they're
just so beautiful on the lips and
they're so on
friend right now and just the fact that
she'd been working on these for about a
year before they came out she was just
so ahead of the trend because we were
deep into matte lipsticks in 2016 so
coming out with a spark dabbling
lipstick I think that was really really
smart of her and now it seems like there
are more and more companies coming out
with products like this and these were
the original ones that I tried and I
still absolutely love them I don't get
mad at me for this one
I know you may not like two-faced okay
and I get that but I'm taking out the
brand names on this this is it's not
about the brand names it's about the
performance of the product and this is
the Too Faced natural love palette I
haven't had a chance to use it a ton
since I did the review but I did test it
quite a bit before I reviewed it and I
did use it quite a bit right after and
you can create so many beautiful
wearable looks with this this is the
perfect like office school kind of
palette where you can get so many looks
you can even smoke it out and bring it
into the evening with some of these
shades over here but you can keep it
nice and light and there's just such a
variety of colors in here I also love
that Too Faced gave us some mid-tone
shades as well along with the deep so
you can really play with the depth of
the look a lot of different colors from
you know the pinks and the purples to
these really warm orange e reddish kinds
of Browns down here these cool tone
topes up here I just feel like it was a
genius layout and the quality of these
are actually very very good I know Too
Faced has not been one that I have been
wowed over this year as far as the the
performance of it because I am more into
looks that are really really loud really
really bold and like the one that I'm
wearing right now which is the color
drain cheers to Beauty palette I have
that video coming out for you but when I
did have a job that I was going into
teaching every single day I know I would
have been using this so much the lasting
power on it is very good and I really
did love this palette I think it's great
I think the packaging is super cute and
this is definitely a well-deserving of a
spot in my top 10 awesome just as in my
worst of 2017 products video I am going
to cheat a little bit and I'm going to
do two products from the same brand here
these are both
rock pallets that I absolutely loved
this is the Pirates of the Caribbean
palette oh my gosh just really enjoyed
this just a lot of fun a little bit
difficult to use in the color selection
as far as me trying to figure out what I
wanted to do with it
but the quality is amazing it's got this
cute little hidden drawer in here and
inside there is the palette this is the
cheek palette this was fantastic quality
who really loved this I mean it's a hot
mess I here stood it a lot I really like
that a lot I also got that I did not
mention on the channel but I did want to
show you and I liked it just as much it
kind of reminds me of the Too Faced
natural love if you have the natural
love you probably don't need this but
this is the Taylor's oldest time Beauty
and the Beast palette by lorac and it's
just so pretty so pretty for those same
same reason why you might want the Too
Faced one it's just a beautiful very
natural-looking look but you can also
get some of these bolder colors in here
these blue and you can deepen it up with
some of these over here this one right
here this one spell breaker is beautiful
along with this one here real you these
are yeah real you is oh that says yeah
real you these have a glitter in them
that is just absolutely beautiful I just
notice my lighting is going out a little
bit because of the shine on this so I
apologize for the depth but focus here
not here focus there that's what's
important not my face but anyway it just
really had a lot of fun with this
quality is fantastic and very much
enjoyed it and I love the packaging of
it I know that these are big and bulky
but I personally like collecting things
like this because for me these are like
display items along with being super
high quality once again I'm going to
cheat we're going into the peach
collection this was the sweet peach
collection by Too Faced I guess I
could've put these these were from a
different collection than the natural
love so these are gonna have its place
all on its own I really love these these
were total game changers for me this
year the peach perfect face powder
I love it has that peach scent to it and
you actually get a little in your mouth
that does taste like peaches and just
the finish on it is so beautiful I am
wearing it on my face today and I
absolutely love this I feel like it
makes my makeup last longer and it's so
finely milled and just a really really
nice product if you like the Laura
see a face powder or the bareMinerals
one I would compare it to those as far
as performance and texture and things
like that it just has that added peach
nough stew it that I personally really
like I also really like the packaging I
think it's super cute and then also
along with that the cooling mat skin
perfecting primer they're primed and
peachy I like this as well it does have
a very very very slight cooling feeling
when you first put it on it really seeps
into the skin very quickly it doesn't
leave your face feeling oily or wet in
any way it is a water-based primer
similar to their hangover primer if
you've ever tried that one it's similar
to that except for that it's got more of
a peach enos to it and you don't have
the coconut water and things in it just
really enjoying this and it is infused
with peach and sweet fig cream they're
not kidding there's well maybe not cream
but there's fig in here and there is
peach in here and there's actually some
research skin benefits to those
ingredients which I thought was very
very neat again full review is gonna be
down below if you want to know more
about these products Wow if you had told
me when I got this product that this was
gonna be in my top 10 for the year I
would have told you you're probably
crazy because this product scared me so
much when I thought I was like no oh
heck no but I had faith I had faith and
I'm so glad I did this is the Kat Von D
Saint and sinner palette I have had so
much fun with this palette not only is
the packaging beautiful but the quality
of the shadows inside they're just
phenomenal they're fantastic shades when
I've talked about big bold punchy looks
this is what I'm talking about right
here just absolutely beautiful looks
I've been able to create with this this
one is definitely not it
beginner-friendly in anyways I have a
screen capture of my friend Georgia
Harris's deep potting and reorganised
the way she did it I have it screen
captured on my phone so what I do when I
go to use this as I have that open in
front of me so I can kind of see the
shades better a kind of phones beep in
they can wait so I can kind of see the
shades better of you know how I want to
use them together and it's just been so
much fun it takes me out of my comfort
zone it makes me try new things and
that's what I love about this and plus
the quality is just as good as it can
possibly get in my opinion I don't
really like her topper shades which were
the ones at the top
than that really really love this this
is another one that might anger some
people I'm just being honest
okay the Jacqueline Hill morphe palette
this has been wonderful for me I have
been loving this and where this really
stood out to me is when I went to New
York for Generation Beauty I think it
was generation Beauty yes I brought this
with me this was the only eyeshadow that
I brought and it so came through for me
I mean every look I created with this
was beautiful I haven't had a look come
out that I was like oh I don't really
like this look with this palette there's
just so many choices there is a little
bit of repetition in here of shade that
I personally would have changed I do
have four videos on this palette and so
including my full review of which of
course I will link down below but yeah I
mean just really really really good
quality but I do want to make sure you
know that this is a different formula
than the regular morphe formula the 3500
s pqz they are not the same formula that
formula I do not like I don't enjoy it
it's not fun for me it's almost like it
feels like processed food versus fresh
food you know like the difference like
you can get it to work you can eat it
it's edible but there's just so much
better goodness in this one than there
is in those in my opinion so if you
haven't picked this up yet and you do
like the shades try to stop peeping at
me stop it I hear you I'll be right
there
you don't like morphe put some stickers
over it and use the palette because
honestly it is so so so good it really
really is and I know people are gonna
ask me why I am NOT putting the Laura
Lee Los Angeles cat's pajamas palette in
here I do feel like this is very high
quality but like I said in the video I
feel like the shades are a little bit
repetitive in here I didn't feel like I
could create a variety of looks with
this so this is why it did not make it
into my top 10 but that does not mean it
is not a good palette the quality of the
shadows is fantastic the shade selection
left me something to be desired but I
just want to make sure throw that out
there because I think Laura has gotten a
lot of very unnecessary flack for this
palette especially from people that have
never tried it and I just want to make
sure I put that out there of why it's
not in here
mm next and we're gonna do my favorite
liquid lipsticks of the year these are
the dose of colors lip liquid lipsticks
I am wearing the one in truffle today
it's the one that I have been addicted
to I wear it all the time another one
that I really really love is moon days I
was wearing that in a video recently I
got so many compliments on moon days but
this formula will dry down but it
doesn't dry down 100% completely like
you may still get like a little bit of a
ring all right did it beep okay all
right I'll be right back okay sweetheart
all right I got to go get my son's
macaroni and cheese out of the pot and
I'll be right back okay we're back
macaroni and cheese is served alright so
as I was saying the dose of colors
liquid lipsticks they do dry down
completely everyone wants small I'll get
like a little ring around my inner lip I
haven't wearing this for what about 45
minutes or so and you can see that it is
completely kiss proof but I think some
of them are like especially the red one
I've noticed I forgot what the name of
the shade is I've noticed a little bit
of a ring if I you know that it's not
completely kiss proof it is very
comfortable for a liquid lipstick that
dries down completely a lot of liquid
lipsticks that dry down like this I
can't wear because I have this texture
thing where I don't like things to be
uncomfortable on my face and this is
absolutely fine for me it's definitely
my favorite liquid lipstick that dries
down completely and I really enjoy this
formula lasting power is really really
good it works really well with a lip
balm if for some reason it does seem to
be a little too dry and you want it to
be more of a lipstick formula rather
than a liquid lipstick you can put
either a balm underneath or over top
works really really well and you can
also do I've also paired these with a
lot of different glosses and they seem
to work really well you just have to be
careful that it's not transferring
outside of your lip line that doesn't
like ooze through the day because I've
had that happen but overall just an
amazing formula really well done so
thankful I found these this year next up
oh the Stila eyeshadows okay these are
called officially the Stila Stila
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows the
people ask me all the time are these
worth the price and I would say if you
like that glitter on your lid I would
say absolutely they're 100% worth the
price
if you on got something stuck in my
eyelash what is that oh my gosh my lash
has been lifting up on the side probably
this entire video I have had the
toughest time with these lashes they're
driving me bonkers I'm gonna take them
off before I fill in the next video
because they're driving me crazy that
they will not stay down I don't know
what's up with these but anyway so yes
they are definitely worth it if you love
that glitter and glow if you are only
gonna wear these for special events
maybe not there are some really good
alternatives from like MBA cosmetics
their chroma lights are amazing they
give a very similar kind of effect and I
think you'll really really like those
they're much less expensive but there's
just some special about this formula I
just I absolutely love it I now have
four of these mmm I know a lot but but I
think they're totally worth it at least
for me they're so much fun to play with
and just the glow that they give off is
just unreal really really love these a
lot number two number two you're gonna
be wondering if this is number two what
could be number one this is the NYX epic
ink liner I've been talking about this
forever well not forever for a lot of
the year I've been talking about this
this was sent to me by NYX
they sent me a whole box of stuff this
is the product that stood out this is
the one that I wanted to tell you about
and oh my gosh is it amazing and it's
interesting because every time I mention
this product it might comments down
below people are like epic ink it's so
good I'm like yeah I know it is a brush
tip liner it goes on very very very
black very very opaque at the point on
it if you can I use it today it gives
you such a sharp point it is so easy to
use if you've never used liquid eyeliner
before I definitely recommend this it is
a drugstore price so you don't have to
worry about breaking the bank on it if
you're thinking about like the Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper or the Stila one
don't bother just get this one it's not
worth it to spend the extra on the more
expensive one go for this one it is
wonderful I don't have to worry about it
smudging throughout the day it isn't a
completely matte finish if you want it
to be a completely matte look you can
always top it with a black matte
eyeshadow and it'll give it you give you
more of a matte look but it's more of
like
Saten kind of finish and I love it it's
oh god it's so good like if they just
continue this I will probably actually
physically cry because I I've found
Holy Grail Ness in this I used to love
the one by Jessie's girl that one is so
hard to find
and also I actually like this one better
I do I do like it better and I feel like
there's something going on with that
Jessie's Girl formula it isn't as black
as it once was it seems a little more
watery I don't know if maybe I got a bad
one but this one and then finally I
didn't want to bring all the products
out but I'm just gonna put a picture of
them right there number one product this
year was the best damn beauty skincare
line by Nicole Guerrero and this is the
thing this is what's really weird about
this is I got such good results from
these products and people my comment
section when I did the video just lit up
people that said that they got good
results as well but you know what people
also said was if this stuff is so good
why doesn't Nicole go use it I have no
idea why she doesn't use it
I don't know Nicole Guerrero I was in a
room with her one time years ago and it
was wavy for best damn beauty so I
couldn't ask her hey Nicole why didn't
you use this skincare brand that you
haven't even thought up yet I can
honestly tell you I've never watched
Nicole Guerrero video all the way
through I've watched the beginning of
one it's just not she's her videos are
just not my personal taste maybe I could
learn something from her maybe I should
watch more videos because I've heard
she's excellent at tutorials but I am
NOT a Nicole Guerrero person but this
skincare line is amazing I saw some of
the best results that I saw in skincare
all year from this line I used it
religiously I think for three or four
months I can't remember I think it was
like three and a half months did I use a
skincare line and it was amazing for me
I can't say enough good things about
this and again I will link the full
review down below here's a little hint
if you don't have time to watch my
entire video just skip to the full
review at the end I usually put
timestamps down in the video description

price point and all that I've got all
that in the video but if you just want
to know that nitty gritty of the best
stuff just click to the full review and
it'll tell you the products that I
personally would recommend the most but
when it's a game-changer like this that
I saw such amazing results you'll see in
the before and after photo just
incredible results and I look back to
videos that I shot at my old house three
years ago and I honestly feel like I
have less wrinkles than I did three
years ago when I was filming at my house
because I wasn't using a really good
skincare routine he really was the best
damn beauty of the year I have to say it
