under $25 that I think would make really
good gifts for people this holiday
season I've got a ton of things for you
from Ulta Sephora and also elsewhere to
share with you so if you're interested
in that hang tight we're getting started
right now we got a lot to talk about so
let's go ahead and just jump into Ulta
the first product that I want to share
with you under $25 is the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge
ornament it is $5 I really like this
sponge it reminds me of the $20 Beauty
Blender I don't feel like it's quite as
good as the Beauty Blender but it
definitely works very very well it's not
quite as soft but it does a really good
job so I've definitely recommend that
from Maybelline this one's online-only
it's called the lash sensational mascara
holiday ornament it's $8.99 I really
like this mascara it gives a lot of
length a lot of volume it's not
difficult to remove it's just a
fantastic mascara so I definitely
recommend that next up we have the
L'Oreal voluminous lash mascara set it's
$12.99 I really like the lash paradise
mascara it is a little bit clumpy err it
reminds me a lot of the better than sex
mascara from Too Faced
a lot of my subscribers and the
collective brain of makeup also going to
say they actually like this one better
than the two-faced one because they
don't find it to be as clumpy which is
really really cool I personally don't
find it to be as clumpy either but it
still is a little clumpy for me but that
makes my lashes look like there are more
lashes so I personally kind of like that
I've never tried the primer that comes
with it so I can't vouch for that but I
do like this and it is a cute little
gift this one's also online-only it's
from essence it's the let it glow
holiday bundle it's $14.99 I haven't
tried everything in the set but I've
tried quite a few things there's some
really good stuff in here we've got
their mosaic blush which is really good
we've got one of their highlighters
which are awesome the face of kits those
three pan kits are pretty good I'm not a
big fan of that pink stick thing that's
in there but I feel like there's enough
in here a really good stuff if you want
to get a nice gift set of makeup for
somebody that's got a lot of good things
in it I definitely recommend this one
especially if they're into the whole
contour highlight thing and I love that
one of the face
sets has some deeper colors in it so
it's been good for many many skin tones
next up is from julep this is the stars
of the show bestsellers three-piece set
it's $16 julep is so underrated they're
liquid lipsticks are really really nice
they're very very comfortable they dry
down a little bit more than the
bareMinerals ones but not quite as much
as the Oprah ones they're kind of a
happy medium between their but they're
really really comfortable there was a
video that Emily Noelle 83 did where she
tried the big huge set of these because
it was Oprah's one of Oprah's Favorite
Things and she really loved them Oprah
loves them I love them they're really
good but they don't dry down completely
just be aware of that it also comes with
their oxygen treatment nail treatment
which is really nice to use in between
manicures to kind of help your nails to
be stronger I do own this I do really
like it a lot their eyeliners are pretty
good they're not my favorite eyeliners I
do find that they run down a little bit
if I put them on my lower lash line but
I do really like them on the upper lash
line they're very very creamy
they smudge really let nicely if you
like a smoky eye like a smudgy eye they
work really well for that
next up is something that's not
available online right now it's the
morphe 25 a and B eyeshadow palettes
I've never tried these but they are the
same formula as the Jaclyn hill palette
that I absolutely love these would be
the only morphe palettes that I would
invest in beyond the Jaclyn hill palette
because I don't prefer the other
formulas this is the only formula that I
like they are sold out online but you
might be able to find them in store so I
wanted to mention them they're $18 each
this ones online only two it's a kit of
three of the L'Oreal infallible paints
eyeshadows I do have a bunch of those
these are really really nice if you like
that bright foiled look lasting power is
just okay compared to like high-end
foiled eyeshadows but they're really
really good especially if you're just
starting out using a formula like this
they're really fun to play with I love
the shades that they chose they chose
really good ones so I definitely
recommend this set next is a set from
Laura Geller that has one of my favorite
highlighters and it's the gilded goddess
three-piece illumining collection it's
$19 and it has gilded honey in it which
is a beautiful very slightly gold toned
highlighter it is gorgeous and I really
really love this I'm so excited to see
it I'm assuming that it's a smaller
version but when do you ever go through
an entire highlighter honestly I haven't
try the little stick that's in there but
I have tried the spackle and I do enjoy
that as a primer so that's definitely a
recommend the next up lorac there's two
things from lorac the Mod goddess alter
ego lipgloss set there's a couple of
these they're 1950 I really like the
lorac lip glosses they're just not
sticky very slightly tinted give your
lips like a nice just tinted look
they're very very pretty and they're
very very comfortable they're not overly
sticky and I really really enjoy their
lip gloss formula also the Mod goddess
alter-ego lipsticks set there's a couple
of though they are currently on sale
hopefully they stay there by the time
this video goes up but it's just a
really nice creamy lipstick formula of
course they're not liquid lipsticks they
don't dry down but they're very very
comfortable and I do enjoy their
lipstick formula next up if you like a
glowing goddess look the Becca glow on
the go rose gold set it comes with the
pressed one which is my personal
favorite and then it does come with a
liquid one I feel like their liquid one
isn't as good at least in my opinion as
the pressed I feel like it accentuates
pores more but the press version is
really really nice and for twenty
dollars it's nice to be able to try one
of those press formulas now we're
hitting $25 with the Too Faced
online-only Too Faced is my life set
again it's $25 you get a ton of stuff in
here it's a great way to try out the Too
Faced brand some of these things in here
have been hits for me some of them have
been Miz's the melt off eyelash thing
does not work for me at all I've heard
from other people that it does work for
them it doesn't work for me it's like a
mascara remover the mascara I do like
the better than sex mascara it is a bit
clumpy for me but I do enjoy it I feel
like it makes my lashes look very
voluminous I love the hangover RX primer
the bronzer is very nice if it seems to
look good for your skin tone and the
liquid lipsticks they're a little drying
for me but they're not terrible there's
definitely ones that I like less than
these they're just okay for me now let's
go ahead and move over to Sephora so
we've got the bite Beauty the perfect
bite amuse-bouche lipstick set the
amuse-bouche lipstick formula is
wonderful it is so hydrating and just
feels really good on the lips and the
shades are beautiful they're not patchy
at all I just really love this formula
this is a great way to try it at $19 it
is currently on sale
hopefully it stays there the Bekaa glow
on the go highlighter set $20 very
similar to what we were seeing over at
Ulta it's just different shades there's
two different shade options available
for you again $20 this is the tarte
hardest pro glow to go highlight and
contour palette i have the bigger
version of this this is the smaller
version but it does look like it's the
exact same formula is $23 just a really
really nice formula really great lasting
power and it really looks beautiful on
the skin really sets into the skin
doesn't set on top of it kind of becomes
part of your skin it's just a very very
nice formula this is a brand that
doesn't get I don't think enough hype
this is nude sticks it's the what's your
mat and nudes and Red's is the one I'm
going to show you but they do have a
couple different versions the nude
sticks pencils are very nice they're
very creamy and what I love about them
is they're very long-lasting and they
wear down very very gracefully they're
just a beautiful formula and I really
enjoy them a lot so that's $24 now this
one is good for anybody I really feel
like this is one of those unisex things
where anybody would really like it the
Jack Black
it's bomb formula it's $25 for this set
I love this formula my daughter recently
had very very chapped lips you know how
kids get when they get chapped lips and
they look and they look and they look
and they look and then all of a sudden
next thing you know they've got you know
their lips are just crackled and nasty
well I had one of these that was my
husband's and I lent it to when I say
keep us on your lips all day and I'm
telling you her lips were so much better
after using it for a day or two just
incredible the difference where I don't
feel like it would have been as good
with a different formula just a huge
huge difference really really like that
formula a lot we've got some really
interesting ingredients in it like
avocado oil and some other stuff there
is lanolin and and I remember so you
don't like lanolin you won't like them
but it's really really nice formula
another little two-faced set if you
didn't want to get the bigger one this
one just has the better than sex mascara
and the eyeshadow primer the eyeshadow
primer is fantastic it's really really
good so if you've ever wanted to try
that and you haven't this would be a
great way to try it for 10 bucks here's
another set from nude sticks for $24
this is a really nice set of more
natural looking colors where the other
one was Reds this one's a little more
natural I really like these a lot like I
mentioned earlier they do say that these
can double as cheek products
I haven't personally tried that but I
would imagine it would work very well
you know as kind of a cream blush and
then this here and this one's a fun when
I've talked about these on my channel
before this is a perfume a sampler set
and I do have a video that I'm gonna
link down below which is products that
are worth the hype at Sephora I will
link that so you can see more products
that are kind of like this that are at
different price points where this is
really cool so you get all these little
vials but then you get this coupon where
you can trade it in for your favorite
rollerball of any of the sense that are
included and there's some really
beautiful sets included in this one so I
definitely recommend that you get all
you get to try all the perfumes and then
you the rollerball is basically free
after you buy the little sample vials so
now we're gonna go beyond Sephora and
Ulta and we're gonna go into juvie Oz
place so you're gonna have to go to the
GPS place website for these right now
they're having a sale I'm not sure how
long it's going to laugh but all their
palates are on like a deep discount and
they're amazing if you like insane
punches of color so ones that I
recommend are the masquerade palette
visa harem palette and the Nubian 2 that
I can see there on the site right now
that are on sale oh my gosh
just amazing quality amazing
pigmentation I will also like my reviews
of those pallets down below I believe I
have masquerade and Saharan I don't know
if I have Nubian to a review but it's
the same quality moving over to Walmart
the Mota prismatic face brush set at 16
dollars and 84 cents if you've been
wanting to try those paddle brushes but
you don't want to spend a lot of money
on them and you want really good quality
ones these are number one they're very
very pretty and number two they're just
wonderful they're some of my favorite
brushes for applying a cream of products
you can also apply powder products with
these but I personally prefer to use
them with cream really wonderful brushes
and then over on Amazon we're gonna go
to beauty junkies they have some brush
sets that are really really good they
are I did a video a really long time ago
because they had sent me some brushes
and I compared them to my Sigma brushes
and they performed exactly the same as
my expensive Sigma brushes they're more
expensive they're not like the most
expensive brushes but they're more
expensive so you can get the eye brush
set for 2497 or you can get the kabuki
face brush set that's 1997 both of them
are great I have both the sets I love
them both now we're gonna go into geek
land for a minute for eyeshadows and for
other products so geek chic cosmetics if
you know someone that likes specifically
you know
television shows or anime cartoons
they've got a ton of stuff over there
the Harry Potter collection the
supernatural they've got a poltergeist
collection Doctor Who my favorite single
eyeshadow of all time is called
luckdragon and it is in their single
players collection it is from their
never-ending story collection that they
don't have anymore on the website but
they do still have luckdragon it is a
beautiful beautiful pink shade it's got
a really beautiful almost iridescent
shift to it it's gorgeous I love it and
then also on the same theme you can go
over to Shiro cosmetics I did pull out a
couple of things from the Harry Potter
collection that I got that I loved my
favorite thing that I got is this
butterbeer lip gloss it's just the gloss
but it smells like butterbeer it smells
amazing the every flavor of lip gloss is
kind of weird it does come off with a
blue tint so if you're not really into
that then you probably won't like this
but the idea is is that the scent in
here the flavor in here you don't know
what you're going to get so I thought
that was kind of cute the Polyjuice one
the green one is kind of weird it smells
awful
like because Polyjuice potion is
supposed to smell awful so it does smell
awful it stays with that and it does
have a little bit of a green tint to it
so I don't really like this one as much
but the Felix felissa I do want to show
you this one this one is gorgeous I'm
gonna put this one on no mirror makeup
challenge real quick actually in here
let me get him here I just want to show
you this one real quick overtop of this
this so it smells like creamy butter and
with like a little bit of sweetness to
it you can see it gives it kind of my
lips kind of like a rose gold kind of
look it's really really beautiful so I
definitely recommend this one I like
this one a lot so I hope that you found
some good gift ideas in this video if
you did definitely make sure you share
it with a friend who you think will also
benefit from this video I'm going to
turn the conversation over to you at
this point what are your favorite gift
ideas for the holiday season let's work
together in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness to find the best
gifts possible for all of our friends
and family and maybe even for ourselves
