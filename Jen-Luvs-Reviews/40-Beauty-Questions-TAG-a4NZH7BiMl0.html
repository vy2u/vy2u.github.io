do the tag the 40 questions i think is
what it's called 40 beauty questions
nobody tagged me but that's okay i'm
tagging myself so there I don't know if
you're allowed to do that but I'm doing
it anyway I saw it on like Lynn been
like Lynn Lynn Lynn rocks okay I'm not
sure exactly what a channel name is but
the girl rocks I found her on savages
channel I think they're roommates or
best friends or something like that and
they're both awesome so I'm gonna link
their channels down below very cool
chicks and I'm sure Lin wouldn't mind if
I jumped on tagged even though she
didn't tag me so if one's watching this
hey I'm gonna try to go through this
quickly because it's 40 questions now
some of them a little shocked to be
shocking it's gonna be a shocking video
and one of the first shocking answers is
it's about skincare and it says how many
times you wash your face daily I don't
wash my face I don't wash my face the
only time I wash my face well if you can
count it washing your face is splashing
water on my face in the shower because I
have found that when I wash my face it
messes up the ph balance that I got
going on and I get either dry or I get
breakouts I mean like bad things happen
when I wash my face and I know that's
kind of gross but I just use water I
wash my face with water and everything's
good I use makeup remover to remove my
makeup that's it what skin type do you
have on normal my t-zone gets a little
oily every once in a while what is your
current facial wash I'm actually using
right now though I decided to try the
cleanser that I got in my first sample
society box so i started using this it's
so suitable is biomedical skin
treatments sorry my cat scratching my
notes of my questions that i have here
that i copied from then extremely gentle
skin skin cleanser so i started using
this just because it came in a box we'll
see what happens with this side this is
I'm still on the fence about this but
I'll let you know in a later video about
what I thought of this do you exfoliate
new
what brand you use I don't moisturize
you to use I don't do you have freckles
yes I mostly have like moles no I have
like like moles I'm a moldy kind of
person do you use eye cream new do you
have acne prone skin knew I used to when
I was younger now I'm older and I don't
get acne anymore except for when I wash
my face with soap then I get acne go
figure did you ever use proactive no I
got lucky on that I didn't my skin was
never really bad that I needed to use
something like proactive I'm anything
proactive was around when I would have
used it because I'm that old okay makeup
see this is where I'm going to have some
answers these questions what foundation
do you use right now i'm using um
maybelline fit in 220 dude do I don't
like it but I'm using it because I
bought it um it's a little dark for me
right now what's it's good for right now
but I'm starting to pale out because I
stopped using my my tanning stuff
sunless tanner so I'm going to be
switching this and I'm going to get some
revlon colorstay I don't let you know
what I think about that when I get that
but right now i'm using this and it
makes me shiny ah concealer concealer
that i use I use to face absolutely
flawless and I do love this every once
in a while when I don't get lastly
because the babies keep me up at night
up a little bit on mouth um but I don't
get blemishes anymore like i said
earlier so i only really use it for my
under eye sometimes do you know you're
under tone color I'm like olive e olive
ish is that a word alava Shh what do you
think of fake eyelashes I need someone
to teach me how to use fake eyelashes
I've watched this tutorials I've tried
to do it and I stink at it and I have to
get one of my friends I have friends
that are like really good at it and I
just have never gotten around to like
ask anime help me did you know that you
were supposed to change your mascara
every three months yes and it makes me
sad because I hate throwing away mascara
when I think that it still has good
mascara and especially if it costs me a
lot of money what brand of mascara do
you use for mascara right now I'm
switching on and off between the Laura
Mercier
a-and the covergirl lash blast last
blast fusion water resistant and the
laura mercier full-blown volume mascara
and black I don't like either of these
they both stink in my opinion but I'm
gonna use them for three months and this
is my last month using them and then I'm
gonna buy something new and hopefully
that works better sephora mac sephora
i'm a sephora girl I have 11 mac
lipstick that I love loop and that it is
in shy girl and I do use it quite often
I like this lipstick it doesn't you
can't really see the color because this
is too bright and want to put my hand up
and turns yellow so sorry about that but
it's like a peachy kind of color and I
really like it it's kind of like those
so sometimes i have to darken it with
other colors because it's a little light
and it's a little bit hasty but smells
nice they're lipsticks no like no
marshmallows I think they smoke
marshmallows that's my opinion mac
lipsticks smells like marshmallows who
knew all of you the pine that clip stick
near that but I think that's all I owned
by Mac um I don't know why I just always
like Sephora do you have a mac pro card
yeah what makeup tools do you use and
makeup application you guys know this
and sorry for the dirty case this is
like the dirtiest case ever because I
use it every day these are my eco tools
I brushes these are my favorite favorite
favorite brushes and their weird brushes
like this one's huge this one is an
angled crease brush which is weird this
is a typical blending brush and these
are like the tiniest little brushes that
you ever did say but I love them they're
so easy to use they really pack on the
color love those and i actually just
bought what i went over my makeup my 50
i'll i make a budget and i just bought
some Real Techniques brushes that i will
be showing you soon but for right now I
have this sephora professional powder
brush it's number 48 and this brush is
too fluffy and it doesn't really get the
color the powder on my face as well as I
would like I did have a blush brush that
I was using but it scratched the heck
out of my face it I don't know why I
used it for so long this blush brush and
it's so scratchy and I
eat it so that's why I no reason why I
got getting the Real Techniques brushes
cuz I hate that one but I don't even I
don't use an eyelash curler because my
eyelashes are so short it doesn't even
seem to make any difference I mean some
people would definitely argue with me
that it does make a difference but to me
I don't see a difference and it's
awkward and weird and I just don't like
using an eyelash curler I'm a thing do
you use makeup base or primer for the
eyes I do use primary use Urban Decay's
primer potion you've seen that a million
times I use that and then I had two
faced shadow insurance but I lost it I
don't know what I did with it it's
somewhere I'll find it eventually and
I'll be nice surprise and I'll have ties
shadow insurance but yes love in the eye
shadow primer but I don't use a face
primer the next question was do I use
primer for the face to know what is your
favorite eyeshadow color or shade if
you've watched in my videos you know my
favorite eyeshadow palette is my naked 2
palette my favorite color in there is
like picking which is my favorite child
I would probably say ydk is my favorite
to be completely honest and ydk is this
one right here it's like a shimmery like
brownish bronzing oh it's just gorgeous
I'll swatch up and see if you can see
that but I love that color I love all
these colors I love busted too and
suspect and has stolen your all my
favorites babies on blackout I love you
too don't be don't be sad because i
didn't pick you as my favorite just
don't be sad do you use pencil or liquid
eyeliner i love i like liquid and cream
I'm not a big pencil girl I used pencil
for like I've sometimes put it in my
corner down here and then my i forget
what that's called tight line tight line
that's what it's called but i use the
pencil for that but i don't really use
pencils for I they're just too messy for
me they're hard for me to control i'd
much rather use a gel liner or a liquid
liner um how often you poke your eyes
with an eyeliner pencil I poke them
every day when I tight line my eyes I'm
constantly I mean but I don't care
anymore I haven't cared for a long time
about poking myself in the eye what do
you think of pigment I shadows
I don't know what that means I don't
know what a figment eyes on it oh I
dunno because uh makeup geek TV they're
making me a peak website has pigment
eyeshadow I've never used it before that
simple idea um do you use mineral makeup
no I never have I don't know anything
about it maybe one day I'll try it just
because I never have okay my favorite
standalone lipstick believe it or not is
my NYX um lipstick in darling the
swatches on this camera come out
horrible so look on the website to see
but it's like a light pink and it's
shimmery and it looks like I've got a
gloss on when i use it so I like that
one my favorite lip gloss is my Laura
Mercier um with pink diamonds love this
stuff and I talked about this in another
video so i won't go on and on about that
what is your favorite blush you use
anybody that's watching my videos knows
my favorite blush is my sephora cream
blush it's like in the picture of two of
my videos i didn't realize that because
they love it that much my support cream
blush in um rose glow that's my I mean
yeah that's my favorite by the way I'm
gonna do a giveaway when i get to a
hundred subscribers and you might just
get a sephora cream blush I think you
probably will so tell your friends if we
can do a giveaway be some support cream
blush and some other goodies do you buy
your makeup on ebay I have never bought
makeup on ebay I've even know there was
such a thing that's kind of creepy me do
you like drugstore makeup yeah I do do
you go to see ce o--'s cosmetic company
outlets I guess it's like Sally yeah
I've gone there a couple times but I
don't really buy a lot of stuff there
except there was one in the mall that I
got some cool Nick stuff at this beauty
supply place in the mall so I'll be
going back there I like that one better
than Sally's but I don't know what it
was called um did you ever consider
taking makeup classes I did but I got
two kids and there's just no way I just
don't have time and it makes me sad
because I would love to I'm always all
about learning new things are you clumsy
and putting on makeup sometimes
especially with my Urban Decay liquid
eyeliner and perversion that I mess up
more than
the other another eye shadow or any kind
of product because it's always I love it
when I do it right I hate it when I do
it wrong because it's a little liquidy
so it's a little hard to apply so yeah
sometimes I'm definitely clumsy
definitely name a makeup crime that you
hate when people wear dark lip liner and
a light lip gloss ooh that's so creepy
to me I don't like that at all do you
like colorful shades of makeup on my
eyes I do on my lips I don't my lips I
can't do like bright colors on my lips I
think it makes me look really weird I
don't know I'm just not adventurous that
way but my eyes I love bright colors on
my eyes what celebrity always has great
makeup I have no idea I have no time to
look at celebrities in their makeup I
don't care unless they're going to teach
me about the makeup I don't care if you
could leave the house using just one
makeup item what would you use eyeliner
absolutely no question about it I would
put on my eyeliner could you ever leave
the house without any makeup on
absolutely I do it all the time do you
think you look good even without makeup
on yes but i think i look better with
makeup on definitely i'm gonna do a cool
video um soon where you'll get to see me
without makeup so you can let me know
what you think how nasty i live without
my mom but that's coming in your opinion
what is the best makeup line urban decay
definitely urban decay is my favorite
even though i don't like some of their
stuff i like most of it I if I could
only buy from one makeup line i would
pick up in decay at least at this point
but i'm trying some more drug store
stuff that i'm starting to like so we
shall see about that that might change
in the near future what do you think of
makeup makeup is so fun i love makeup I
think makeup is fabulous it's just fun
for me like I could do my makeup like
three times a day i would i would put it
on and I'd take it off and put it on
again I take it off the end and I put on
again and it's just so fun for me like
it's not even about like looking good
for other people it's just what can I do
to my face to make it look like better
or cooler like how can I accentuate this
and how can I use these colors and it's
more of an artistic thing for me than it
is like a beauty thing like because I'm
not artistic at all like at all so the
is something that's really fun for me
that I can do that's a little bit artsy
and I don't know I just really enjoy it
I have fun with it think of this just
super fun love it I do I just love it so
