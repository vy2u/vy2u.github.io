choice makeup and skincare review along
with 5 minute makeup challenge we are
gonna do so much cool stuff in this
video hope you're as excited as I am for
this video oh my gosh it's gonna be so
much fun so what happened was let me let
me tell you what happened was I got an
email from published choice asking me to
do a sponsored video for them for their
new gorgeous on the glow makeup kit
along with their brand new primer and I
was really excited about it because you
guys know how much I love my polish
choice skincare I did do a skincare
sponsored video I will link that down
below they actually sent me a couple of
things so I could read me again the
toner that I really really liked the
wrinkle repair retinol serum and like
the magical resist line firming line
minimizer which I think was like the
star of the show the last time I did a
sponsor video for them so I was really
excited they sent those to me I have
tried Paula's Choice makeup before I
have their contour palette that I really
really like a lot so when they wanted to
send me some of their makeup I was like
yeah that's so awesome because I really
try to only do sponsor videos for brands
that I really know I'm going to like
because nothing is more awkward than
saying you'll do a sponsor video for
someone and then realizing you don't
like anything I can tell you I have not
tried either of these products yet they
just send them to me last week so this
is gonna be a first impression with this
5 minute makeup challenge but of course
because I'm Jen and this is Jen Lowe's
reviews we got to do ingredient analysis
and all of that stuff so we're gonna do
the 5 minute makeup challenge in a few
minutes after the ingredient analysis so
if you want to skip straight to the 5
minute makeup challenge the time stamp
for that is here and you can skip to
there right now or you can stay for the
ingredients if you're curious about the
ingredients so let's go ahead and start
with the primer this primer is $30 for
an ounce and when compared to some other
popular primers we have like the benefit
Porefessional which is thirty one
dollars but you only get 0.75 ounces so
that's 41 dollars and 33 cents per ounce
and then the hourglass is 54 dollars an
ounce the Smashbox
a photo finish primer is $36 announce
the Beca first light filter face primer
is $38 announcing the makeup Forever's
$37 and L so it is less expensive than
those but it also has bonus things in it
this has retinol palmitate in it which
the Smashbox also has retinol palmitate
in it but one thing that this has that
the Smashbox does not have is that this
also has UVA and UVB sunscreen and it
actually has two types of UVA and two
types of UV UVB where the Smashbox does
not have that so if you do wear the
Smashbox just fair warning make sure you
use a sunscreen with that because it can
make your skin extra sensitive to the
Sun so be really careful with the
Smashbox so that it was really excited
about with this it's also got a lot of
other good anti-aging goodness in it it
also has some skin soothing things in
here like aloe and a few other
ingredients that are really nice for
like just making a skin feel good this
does have dimethicone minute though so
if you find that dimethicone
clogs your pores you definitely do not
want to get this but if it doesn't this
seems to be really good again I haven't
used it yet we're gonna do first
impression today I do want to briefly
mention another product they wanted me
to show you this is the radiance renewal
mask and I use this for the first time
last night and I found it to be quite
nice I can't speak to any effects of it
I could only speak to the ingredients
the description of it says that it's for
anti-aging for all skin types provide
skin softening and hydration it's
supposed to be your last step in your
evening routine and I really did enjoy
using this last night it did have a
little bit of a stickiness to it as it
dried down but once it dried down it was
perfectly fine had a kind of a cooling
effect on the skin it just felt really
nice again this does have dimethicone
just like the primer does so if you
don't like dimethicone definitely don't
get this but if you don't mind I'm at
the cone I really enjoyed this from
first impression just from using it once
again I can't speak to long-term effects
because I just got it but so far so good
on this one so now let's get into the
gorgeous on the go makeup kit so this
kind of inspired the whole five minute
makeup challenge thing because I haven't
done a 5 minute makeup challenge in a
really long time and it's not really
very smart of me to do one with products
that I've never used before but you know
all about the adventure on this channel
so in this kit you get the palette here
and you also get a lip gloss it is a
full-size lip gloss and it is in the
shape plum it does look like it has a
little bit of sparkle in there so if you
don't like that in your lip gloss you
probably won't like this but I
personally like a little bit of sparkle
as long as it doesn't hang around too
long after the product is worn off and
you just have a lot of sparkle on your
lips I'll let you know
but the palette looked really
interesting and one thing I really like
about it is that this packaging see how
it stays open a lot of products they'll
close on you if you try to leave the
mirror open so this has a really stiff
nice packaging so I really like that
about the packaging it has a blush a
highlighter and that's three eyeshadows
and this is actually a powder eyeliner I
am gonna try to use it as eyeshadow
today to kind of deepen up my outer
corner I kind of have a plan so we'll
see how that goes but we're gonna do
like a real natural look today with it
and see what happens we're gonna we're
just gonna we're gonna go for it here as
far as ingredients in here and there's
only two ingredients you might want to
worry about and that's talc and
phenoxyethanol and that's only if you're
sensitive to them most people are not
sensitive to them and they're in pretty
much every single ingredient analysis I
ever do on this channel it's very rare
that talcum phenoxyethanol are not in an
eyeshadow formula so it's not unusual
the blush does have a red pigment called
CI one five eight eight zero that has
been shown to be persistent or
bioaccumulative but that may be based on
the amount in the product and the amount
may be negligible it may not be enough
in this product to make a difference as
far as the bioaccumulation
but if that freaks you out just so you
know that is in the blush also with the
lip gloss the only thing in here that
raised any red flags was the
phenoxyethanol but phenoxyethanol is him
almost every makeup product it's a it's
a replacement for parabens so because
people don't like paraben people are
sensitive to parabens phenoxyethanol is
one that people are less likely to be
allergic to so that's why they replace
it and you really need preservatives and
cosmetics girls they get a little funky
and gross and you don't want that so I
personally don't have a problem with
phenoxyethanol but if you do just you
know it's in here so if we're talking
about value
price per gram the problem is is it
comes with a full-size lip gloss and a
pallet so you have to kind of decide
what's worth what so if you look at
popular lip glosses at Sephora we have
the buxom at $20.00 Smashbox at $24 and
the toothpaste at $21 so let's say this
is $15 if we're saying this is $15 then
that would make the pallet $3.75 per
gram of product the whole kit is $45 so
$30 here will be $3.75 per gram if you
say that the lip gloss is worth $20 that
brings this down to three dollars and 12
cents per gram which isn't a bad value
but it's not a great value it's kind of
middle of the range like urban decay
kind of price per gram so that's kind of
where it falls in case you're curious
what kind of value you're getting okay
so I've got my arsenal of tools down
here I've kind of got everything picked
out that I'm gonna use
oh I haven't done a 5 minute makeup
challenge actually I don't even know if
I've ever done a 5 minute makeup
challenge I did a 2 minute makeup
challenge when my channel was brand
brand new if you want to watch something
that's really silly that I did a long
time ago like 4 years ago I will link
the 2 minute makeup challenge down below
it's pretty funny but we're gonna try
the 5 minute makeup challenge we're
gonna see how it goes I'm a little bit
nervous but you know what sometimes you
don't have a lot of time to get ready so
we're gonna do like a work/school easy
everyday kind of look my microphone is
down here by my arsenal of stuff so if
you hear a loud bang it's because I hit
my left your phone so across our fingers
that that doesn't happen
5 minute make a challenge ready set go
oh face primer okay it's a gel looking
consistency we're just gonna smack that
all over I think I use too much it feels
like I use way too much you know feels
good though it has a very light
chemically kind of scent feels very
dimethicone II why am i caring about
putting the top on I don't know all
right Garnier BB cream it's my favorite
for like light everyday kinds of looks
why didn't I put my hair back I don't
know
and we're gonna use the motor brush
because it's super stinking fast BAM
alright foundation laid over that very
very nice or BB cream lay it over that
very nice let's go into we're gonna do
brows and we're gonna do a mix of the
eyeliner and the taupe shade for the
brows eyeliner shade taupe shade who I'm
messing it messing it up alright here we
go for brows whoo that's working really
nicely so so I'm hoping that this will
be a really nice travel kit for people
that travel for work oh I'm gonna mess
them up because if you can carry
everything in this little thing it'll be
nice job it microphone I don't have time
for you but it'll be really nice to be
able to just pack this on a carry-on
it's all powder products so you don't
have to worry about being stopped by TSA
about liquids alright brows done okay
let's go into our shadow primer quick
quick quick
smack that on you will ask me all the
time is eyeshadow primer necessary I
think it depends on your eyes and how
much you care about the vibrancy of your
shadows alright we're gonna go ahead
whoa I just threw my through something
some just fell okay we're gonna go into
the crease with the lighter color that's
the wrong brush I didn't mean to grab
that one we're gonna go for it oh my
gosh I got a funky piece of primer um
faith alright even be able to ban them
well that's a very pigmented I'm
definitely gonna need to blend that out
that is very pigmented pick more
pigmented than I expected it to be
how we looking on time oh my goodness
only two and a half minutes left my half
my time is done holy moly that was fast
okay
gonna pack the gold shade all over my
lid well that's really dark dude so dark
I wasn't expecting it to be so dark oh
well we're going with it we're going
with it we ended up a little smokier
than I expected okay we're gonna hit the
brows brow bone with the light shade I'm
gonna blend that out
holy moly this is going way too fast
eyeliner hitting up the powder eyeliner
it's actually working really well I'm
surprised I love that I have to worry
about the mirror falling down oh my
goodness oh my goodness this is taking a
little longer than I expected though
okay little crooked on there that's okay
alright we're going for mascara and
we'll deepen up the outer corner if we
have time I don't know if we will though
definitely some fallout on the cheeks
but that's because I didn't tap my brush
off that was my fault I was going too
fast
okay mascara is done this is the L'Oreal
voluminous by the way it's fantastic if
you've never tried that mascara oh my
goodness all over my face everywhere Oh
concealer concealer to the rescue hard
candy concealer bam bam blend it out
blend it out go go go I need to get the
blush on hot blush blush go oh mirrors
here
whoa that's pigmented that looks
fantastic highlighter go ohhh wrong
brush I look like a hot mess I need more
concealer stat oh no tops coming off ah
malfunction malfunction I had more
fallout I need a blend blend blend blend
alright well this is the only thing I've
missed on but I was close we're gonna
add the lip gloss on but I was really
close another 30 seconds for lip gloss
it's going on super patchy not sure if
I'm a fan of this gloss it's very sticky
well not sticky it just feels heavy and
thick so we got the five and a half
minute makeup challenge but still
something you could do before work you
know something you could do before
school that would be very fast how we
look in I think we're doing all right
considering but I think overall that was
a huge success
I broke my concealer alright I also
didn't get to my face powder to set my
face so I'm gonna go ahead and do that
again real quick so we're looking at
maybe six minutes for this look if we
want to be fair let's go ahead and talk
about the products in my first
impression so first impression of this
is it's a very typical very heavy thick
lip gloss it has a really nice amount of
light pigmentation but not a thick
pigmentation so if you like a little
wash of color on your lips a more
natural color this is great I don't see
very much sparkle I don't know how much
I'm actually going to use this just
because I don't prefer that heavy
feeling but if that doesn't bother you
then you should be okay it does have a
very light like plasticy kind of scent
to it it doesn't have a nice scent but
it's not a very strong scent so if
you're sensitive to scents this probably
won't bother you as far as the
performance of these I'm actually really
impressed with everything here I was
that's with how easy the eyeliner was
the shadows went on super pigmented I
was able to use all three colors this
did come out a little darker than I
expected on my skin tone but if you are
of a medium to deeper skin tone this
won't look as smokey as it does on me if
you're of a lighter skin tone you can
probably mix some of these together
maybe even use the highlighter as your
lid color and then kind of even up the
outer corner with this gold a shade over
here the transition color for me which
was really really nice this taupe shade
was great for a transition if your
deeper than me you might be able to mix
the just like I did for my brows you
might be able to mix a little bit of the
eyeliner in to deepen up the crease
shade a little bit for you if your
deeper and this was a really nice
highlight shade brow bone shade for me
this might be a nice a brow bone shade
for someone that's a little bit deeper
to kind of lighten up the brow bone of
course you could always use the
highlighter to brighten up the brow bone
as well I really like the pigmentation
on the blush it went on very easily so I
would definitely at this point recommend
this for travel just because I feel like
it gives you kind of everything you need
and I feel like it's very versatile for
a lot of different skin tones I also
really love how sturdy it seems this
clasp on here is really really strong
it's not a magnetic closure it's
actually a click so you don't have to
worry about the magnet getting loose
like some brands the magnet gets loose
and it can kind of open up and travel I
don't feel like this would open up and
travel you might want to put it in a
plastic bag just to make sure but really
really happy with this the primer I was
also felt like was really good next time
I will definitely use less I felt like I
squirted way too much kind of got a
little overzealous but felt really good
seems to smooth out very easily I don't
know if it filled in my pores I wasn't
really focusing on that I was going
really fast but I will definitely keep
you posted and definitely subscribe to
the channel if you want to see whether
these make it back into my monthly
favorites for March because there I can
see this definitely being a chance of
these making it back in I do do a
countdown so it'll go from the worst
product I've tried all the way to the
best so I'm curious to see where these
might fall if they end up in the
countdown this month

to really love polish choice as a brand
