requests recently for more skincare
videos especially regarding ingredients
so today we're gonna be talking about
five things that may be doing damage to
your skin that you may not even realize
so if you're interested in that I'm
about to bring you some tips right about
now before I start I do want to lay know
I did eat some pink M&amp;amp;Ms before I
started filming and I've been guzzling
water trying to get the pink out of my
tongue but if you can see the pink on my
tongue while I'm talking I apologize
I need a film right now oh we're our
main job with our skin is we want to
make sure our skin is balanced we want
to make sure our skin is pH balanced you
may have heard there's two ways that our
skin needs to be balanced we need to be
hydrated and we also need to be
moisturized this is something I've had a
really hard time wrapping my brain
around because I think of like a plant
and if you don't water the plant it gets
dehydrated and dry yes but our skin is
different because we have two ways that
we cannot be getting the things in our
skin that we need so water and oil so
when we think about dehydrated skin
we're talking about
a lack of water in the skin when we're
talking about dry skin we're talking
about a lack of moisture a lack of oil
in the skin so that's what we're gonna
be talking about today is how to keep
our skin in balance when your skins
dehydrated it may look really dull if
your skin is dry and flaky you're most
likely having a problem with the oils in
your skin so my first tip I have for you
is to drink more water and one thing
that I do in order to drink more water I
know this sounds weird but it works for
me and maybe it'll work for you is I
drink out of a cup with a straw and for
some reason I don't know if it's like an
oral fixation thing or something but I
drink more water when I'm drinking out
of a straw I have one of those tumbler
cups that I got at the grocery store
with a straw in it or I take my coffee
cup that I use in the morning because I
hate doing dishes and I filled it up
with water and then I drink that out of
a disposable straw and I don't know why
it helps me to drink more water the
water then goes into your body it goes
into all of the cells of your body
including your skin cells and will
hydrate your skin you can also hydrate
your skin and by using products that
have humectants in them such as aloe
hyaluronic acid I almost forgot it for a
second and glycerin those are supposed
to hydrate your skin by bringing
moisture from the air into your skin
sometimes they also bring moisture from
the lower layers of your skin up so it's
really important to have that water in
your system to make sure that you do
have moisture to pull out of your skin
to bring to the upper layers so your
skin doesn't become even more dehydrated
the second tip is to watch your
ingredients there are a few ingredients
that can really mess up the balance of
your skin but one we're going to focus
on today is something called denatured
alcohol and it can hide like a lot of
ingredients under a few different names
so here are the most common names we
have st alcohol for TSV alcohol for TB
denatured alcohol this is one that I see
a lot is alcohol D Nate you'll see that
a lot in makeup products dehydrated
ethanol and alcohol denature they're all
exactly the same thing now if it's
weighed out of the ingredient list you
may not notice it affecting your skin as
much but if it's within the first 10
ingredients the first five ingredients
it's probably going to mess up the
balance of your skin and how it does
that is it strips the oils from your
skin and throws you out of whack this
can make your skin think it needs even
more oil and cause more oil production
it can also enlarge your pores which is
not something that most people want some
people might wonder why in the world do
people even put these in cosmetic
products and a big reason is because
it's a preservative it also can help
with the texture of the product and also
with like matte finish products it'll
help the product to dry down to give you
that really nice matte finish so what I
did was I went on a website called Casa
DNA and I also went to Sephora and Ulta
and I went on scavenger hunt for
products that had denatured alcohol in
it and I made you a nice little less you
can check your cosmetics and you can go
to cos DNA - and check the products that
you have so the first one I want to talk
about is foundations and it's weird
because some of these foundations are
brand new really hyped YouTube
foundations like ones that they sent out
lots of PR and all the big youtubers are
talking about them the first one is the
new Kota Beauty foundation the hashtag
pho filter foundation it's the 11th
ingredient there so it may or may not be
a significant amount it they don't put
percentages on the bottle so it's really
hard to tell where whether it's a lot or
but xi is pretty far down though I'm
going from the least offender to the
most offender by the way so next is the
Tarte Water Foundation broad-spectrum
SPF 15 also known as the rainforest of
the sea foundation that is the 10th
ingredient and the next one is the UA
foundation the essential high coverage
creme foundation it is the 10th
ingredient in that this one is another
beloved foundation the Revlon Colorstay
makeup for combo and oily skin because
they want it to dry down Matt for those
oily skin friends but then it ends up
messing with your pH bones it's not good
it's the seventh ingredient in that now
this one caught me a little off guard
this is the cled up oh you V protective
cream tinted broad-spectrum SPF 50 plus
it's the seventh ingredient in that one
as well
so still their offenders but they're not
the worst ones the worst ones are coming
the Tarte double duty Beauty empowered
hybrid gel foundation it's the fifth
ingredient then we get to one that
really makes me sad because if you would
ask me what's my holy grail drugstore
foundation this is the one that I would
tell you it is the Maybelline fit me
matte and poreless foundation is the
fifth ingredient in that and it's like
oh it was like a punch in the stomach
when I read that one I was like so I'm
really sad about that but I'm not going
to be recommending that one anymore not
surprisingly or maybe surprisingly the
dewy one does not have alcohol in it
it's just the matte one which makes me
really sad because I do really like that
foundation the worst ones which is
another one that surprised me was the
L'Oreal infallible Pro glow foundation
it's the third ingredient in that and
then the next one is another one's been
really hyped and I've seen a lot of the
bigger youtubers talking about this one
and then the more they use it like
they've already done their videos and
now I'm seeing like on Twitter people
like it's kind of messing with my skin a
little bit
it's a YSL all ours full coverage matte
foundation it's the third ingredient and
that foundation and that's that
foundation is really expensive so it was
really really sad to see that they had
put that ingredient in there were so
expensive I was really sad to see that
now I did find some other products that
were not foundation that I wanted to
mention the Kiehl's ultra facial oil
free gel cream is the third ingredient
in that the NYX professional makeup
honey do me up skin serum and primer
it's the third in green
and that one the Shiseido white Lucien
all day brightener broad-spectrum SPF 23
moisturizer it's the second ingredient
in that one and this one this one also
made me cry because I know so many
people love this product I am NOT a
setting spray person I don't like things
sprayed on my face it grosses me out but
I know a lot of people love this the
L'Oreal setting spray second ingredient
I know let's have let's have a moment of
silence for the L'Oreal setting spray
I'm just sad I'm sad about it I feel bad
for people that love it if you're not
having any problems with your skin due
to it it's it's up to you but I'm just
giving you that information she you can
choose what you want to do with your
setting spray I'm not gonna remember
commend it to anybody I'll tell you that
not all alcohols are the same though
some of them are not drawing the three
major ones are that you'll see our
siedel sterile and sÃ¡tiro alcohol those
are the good ones so if you see those
then don't be scared of those those are
fine they're actually good for your skin
alright that was a long one but that was
my favorite so I wanted to go into that
one a little bit longer okay so the next
one to number three is over exfoliating
when you have a lot of dead skin cells
on your face it your face can look
really dull it can clog your pores
leading to acne things like that so
exfoliating your face is good but over
exfoliating is bad especially physical
exfoliators you know those exploiters
where they have like the sandy grit and
you rub it on your face and it kind of
hurts just be really careful with those
because you can really do some damage to
your skin and actually do more damage
than good if you do it too many times
exfoliating your skin is really really
good for brightening your skin for
making your skin look more plump and
youthful and dewy and not necessarily do
because you want your skin to be you
know properly balanced but you know
looking hydrated and fresh and looking
good and there are two different types
of exfoliating there's a physical
exfoliator and then there's a chemical
exfoliator you can chemically exfoliate
more often than you can physically
exfoliate we both the physical and the
chemical you are exposing your
underlying layers of skin so you really
want to make sure you're using a
sunscreen if you're using a either kind
of exfoliator on your skin there's a
website that I really like I think it's
a blog called beautiful with brains and
for physical exfoliation they recommend
so I'm not sure who writes it if it's a
I'm not sure the pronoun
physical exfoliation for oily to dry
skin three to four times a week which
seems like a lot to me
dry skin - and then sensitive skin one
time I personally exfoliate my skin one
to two times a week typically one
because I'm kind of lazy and sometimes I
just don't feel like it you know I'm
tired I don't feel like exfoliate my
face so I don't so usually once a week I
exfoliate for chemical exfoliation there
are some people that chemically exploit
their face twice a day I think it's
really important to do what your skin
tells you is okay and the chemical
exfoliator --zz have different strengths
so lactic acid is less strong than
glycolic acid so if you're not used to
chemically exfoliating your skin you
might want to start with a lactic acid
maybe a couple times a week and then
bump it up if you feel like you need
more number four is one that I have to
convince the men in my life of often is
not using regular soap bar soap on your
face make sure you're using a cleanser
that is specifically meant for the face
because of the pH levels the pH levels
for a body soap are different than the
pH levels for a face soap because your
skin is different so the bar soap is
very alkaline and what its gonna do it's
gonna strip all of those oils and throw
your face out of balance and cause all
kinds of issues so you want to make sure
you use a cleanser that's meant for the
face I know that was a fast one but then
the last one's also a fast one but it
was one that would kind of resonated
with me because I never really thought
about it because I'm kind of lazy when
it comes to skincare especially in the
evening because I'm tired I go through
the routine but I'm not one of those
people that find skincare super
enjoyable all of the time sometimes I do
but not all the time most the time I'm
just trying to get it done and so I can
go to bed but washing your face with
warm water rather than hot water and
what I do which is really bad and that
I'm not going to do anymore now that I'm
educated is I turn on the water and it's
usually kind of cold I splashed my face
with the cold water cuz I'm too lazy to
wait for it to warm up I put on my my
cleanser and then I leave the water
running wallet warms and then by the
time I'm ready to wash mud the cleanser
off the water is like hot and I wash the
cleanser off it's not good I'm not doing
that anymore I don't suggest you do
because again it can dry out the skin
and it
as a hair I've learned that actually
washing your body and your hair and warm
water is better than hot water even
though I'm a huge fan of hot showers I
love hot showers I find them to be
extremely relaxing they're really not
good for your hair or your skin so just
that's another thing that makes me sad
but you got to go with what it really is
instead of what you want things to be
you know sometimes it's like reality
check you know just some bonus ones we
did talk a little bit about sunscreen of
course we always want to make sure we
use our sunscreen whether we're
exfoliating or not alcohol can dehydrate
the skin so if you are going to partake
in the adult beverage like I
occasionally like to do we want to make
sure you hydrate as well so you don't
dehydrate your cells smoking of course
is not good for your skin and then your
diet and making sure you're eating you
know fruits and vegetables rather than a
processed food bad fat content diet it
can really mess with your skin at this
point I'm going to turn the conversation
over to you because we are the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness

these things skin care related makeup
