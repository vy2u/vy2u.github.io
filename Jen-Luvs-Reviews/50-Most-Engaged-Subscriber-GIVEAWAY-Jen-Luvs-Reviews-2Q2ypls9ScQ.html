room I'm actually going to be shooting
at this type of video on my computer
because I feel like it kind of feels
more personal but I just wanted to thank
all of you that have been watching my
videos and commenting I know I haven't
been fantastic at responding every
single comment it's starting to get a
bit overwhelming so just know that I
read all your comments and I appreciate
them so I wanted to let you know that
i'm going to start something new i used
to do subscriber a subscription of the
month and I stopped doing that a while
ago but I want to add that back in
especially now that YouTube has added a
new feature and it is called connecting
with your top fans which kind of bugs me
because I don't really like calling my
subscribers fans I just think that
sounds ridiculous because I'm not a
celebrity but I it lets you sort your
people that subscribe to you by
engagement so people that comment my
videos watch my videos things like that
so it allowed me to see my top 50
subscribers that are the most engaged
and what I decided to do I actually
copied off of a channel called that is
rad her name is Vanessa she's amazing
she did this with her subscribers I'm
totally stealing the idea hi Vanessa
after washing us but I thought it was a
fantastic idea and I put a 1 through 50
into a random name and generator and I
you know I came up with number 37 and
number 37 my 37th most engaged
subscriber is JJ miss may I so
congratulations I'm gonna have you go
through my stash of things I'm gonna go
get my stash of things you can see some
of the stuff that i have that she's
going to get to pick from hold on a
second right back see how do i pause
this thing never used this before how do
i pause I dope ok so here is my box and
I keep all my stuff in and this is the
stuff that I have inside some different
things that I had she can choose from I
have a josie maran argan oil and when
I'm still having erevis Cale of lip
glaze I have this is dr. brandt pores no
more vacuum cleaner I have a
the rock sweet temptations lip gloss I
mean I've got tons of stuff in here I
had this little lamb come a deluxe
sample mascara and that is the
defense'll as i believe yep dear
defenses yes i have an urban decay old
school eyeshadow in graffiti I mean I've
got just got tons of stuff in here I got
let's see what else I have in here ewa

I've got a two-faced lash in Jackson
ejection I mean I've got all parts I had
to steal a countless color pigments I
have tons of these things that I picked
up I thing going off and I love this
thing so I mean it's like packed to the
top with stuff so I'm going to get to
let me know what she's interested in and
pick something out of there so
congratulations to you my dear muah
thank you for being an engagement
scrubber and thank you to my other 50
would be let's take your name so you
know who you are okay so if you're
looking for you were top fans if you
make videos this is how you find it all
right you're going to go over here
you're going to go to video manager then
you are going to go to community and if
you're looking for your inbox your
YouTube mail that's where that is you
click on fans hahahaha and now I'm going
to sort this by engagement I laughs
discuss fans is just such a ridiculous
thing to call people unless i'm a
celebrity and I'm surely not okay so
