month of glamour doll eyes then we're
all eyes is a really fun subscription
and I don't see it
often on YouTube so I'm very honored to
get this as a promotional subscription
glamour doll eyes sends this otm or of
the month i shadow subscription to me
every month but that does not influence
my review at all
it doesn't help glamour doll eyes if I
am dishonest it doesn't help you if I'm
dishonest it doesn't help me either
because you know being dishonest is just
doesn't make you feel good about
yourself at least doesn't make me feel
good about myself so I'm gonna just jump
right in and show you what is in this
usually the glamour doll eyes
subscription the bag or the box or
whatever it comes in matches the
eyeshadow now I've got this like green
maybe there's a green eyeshadow in here
I don't know but it's just a different
kind of bag it actually is really neat I
like it's big it's way bigger than I'm
used to and I don't know it's just I'm
not sure what's gonna happen this month
we shall see let's just post them things
out and she would teach in here okay so
the first thing I see is Spring Fling
this is their new line of eyeshadows
just some beautiful colors they sent a
couple in the past and I really really
like the ones that I've gotten so far we
got Delilah we got old money in which we
are picking a yellow and just beautiful
beautiful beautiful and they are mineral
eyeshadows which is if you like mineral
eye shadows then it's great for you if
you don't then of course this isn't
going to be one for you oh by the way as
far subscribing to the otm I will put
all the information down below it's very
very tricky to sign up and I'll put
information down below on how all that
works it's not like a straight
subscription service the way that like
Etsy and Birchbox and all those things
are so inside here we have a little card
and this is shinobi cosmetics by vanessa
warner and she's the owner and creator
of this Genovia cosmetics and we got a
mineral eyeshadow from them Ono is on
eyeshadow it's a blush cool let's see
what this postions like and I do love
mineral blushes mineral eye shadows all
of those things they make me so happy
sometimes mineral blushes have a lot of
sparkle in them which I'm not a big fan
of okay this color is very interesting
it's almost like a brown let me show you
okay so that's the color it's a strange
color for a blush in my opinion there
that is on my hands it's like brown
maybe this is consumed a B some more
like a bronzer that looks more like a
warm toned bronzer to me
definitely pigmented I'll definitely
have to try it I don't know I'm not
quite sure about it and another thing it
doesn't come with a sifter I really
really like what mineral stuff comes
with a sifter because it's less messy
but I don't know we'll see oh and the
color of this it just says Vanessa
Vanessa blush so maybe that's the color
is Vanessa and Vanessa is the creator so
I guess you name this one after herself
isn't that nice I always wanted to have
a makeup named after me and I guess
that's one way to do it it's create you
a makeup line and then name something
after yourself maybe I'll do that one
day maybe you'll see but yeah I I don't
know we'll have to try it and put it on
okay next one we got the glamour doll
eyes eye shadow and this one is in
vanilla unicorn your names are so
creative so this is probably a sparkly
white which is always nice for any
season really for inner corner highlight
the brow bone highlight you don't like
this new angle by the way it's nice to
have this desk here that I can put stuff
on all right let me show you what this
looks like okay so that's what that
looks like there and it's not as sparkly
as I thought it would be let's get a
better dip in there I'll buy my own
mm-hmm huh interesting it's like an
iridescent white so neat there we go
I just looking at it I was able to get a
better swatch of it sorry about that
black eyeliner at the top but hopefully
you can catch that that very subtle
iridescent sin there very cool now I
don't know any eyeshadows quite like
this I own some iridescent shadows but
nothing that isn't as opaque is this
that this that's the white and then it's
got the eared essence kind of put in
there that is a really cool color so
typically in glamour doll eyes you get
an eye shadow a little bonus and usually
some candy or some kind of sweet treats
now I do feel like there's more stuff in
here than that which is kind of crazy I
this is a lot for six dollars very very
excited let's say this is a
nail polish so neat glamour to Isis our
nail polish that's so cool and it's a
flash lacquer by glamour doll eyes so
cool and it's going off to Paris let me
shake it up and see what's what's the
deal is with this polish it looks very
thin looks like probably a three coat
polished I would say the way that it's
dripping down the side doesn't look
super opaque but I will keep you posted
on this next glamour analyse video I
will update you on the amazingness or
lack of amazingness of this because
there's really no way to know unless I
put it on and I'm not putting it on
right now actually you know what I'll
put on the back of one of these cards
and see no no that's actually really
cool so check that out that's the nail
polish that's really exciting actually
yeah it's just got a different kind of
texture to it that I wasn't expecting
it's actually a really cool color I'm
excited to see what that looks like on
nails yes
when I met by texture is like it's got
like a creaminess to it that I wasn't
expecting very neat there's no shimmer
or sparkle in it at all but yeah very
excited about that glamour no eyes went
out of their way this month holy moly
lots of stuff there's more in here can
you believe that okay here's my candy
lancaster naturally flavored vanilla
caramel and soft cream and i hope this
is made in lancaster pennsylvania
because that's actually not too far from
me and i always love getting these from
lancaster because it just feels like
it's probably a little more homemade
than anything else there's more stuff in
here here's cards we usually get cards
but we got the glamour and all eyes
business cards with the chickee on the
back and then we got a Sedona lace card
we usually do we got a glamour and all
ice chipper and then this is called
one-way ticket and I guess that's the
name of in the subscription for the
month and it talks about what is in here
and it talks about the shinobi cosmetics
Vanessa blush sample matte orange toned
coral that's why it looks a little odd
can be built by Larry by layering here
the owner of glamour doll eyes is also
Vanessa and it says that there's another
eye shadow in here a better look in here
instead of just looking at the card I
wanna see what else is in here just like
more stuff there's another caramel yums
I'll drool all over the place if I eat
these now so I'm not going to there's
like two more things in here there's
another glamour doll eyes eye shadow
this one's called one-way ticket okay so
this is the one that was actually the
subscription eyeshadow this month this
one's cool okay so there's that
you just beautiful like a kamal screen
there's that put it next to that white
beautiful oh my gosh Vanessa did great
on that one holy moly
I love that it's almost got like it's
like a moss green but it's got a little
bit of a blue in there and they in the
undertone of it just gorgeous so very
excited about that and I think there's
one more shadow in here this is crazy
okay I can't even I can't even believe
that they sent all these shadows I think
it's either six or eight dollars a month
depending on how you sign up for it I
think so that's just crazy so we got how
many we got three eyes three eyeshadows
a blush three caramels and and little
mini nail polish so this is this was a
big month a huge month for glamour doll
eyes okay this one is called insomnia
and we'll zoom is one an oh my gosh wait
till you see this oh my goodness look at
that can you see those the sparkle in
there there's I guess it's like oh
there's some purple sparkle in there
let's watch an egg so excited BAM
that is going to be gorgeous that is
gonna be a beautiful crease color right
there okay so there is the chinoe V
Vanessa blush there is the vanilla
unicorn by glamour doll eyes that is one
way ticket by glamour doll eyes and that
is insomnia by glamour doll eyes feels
like there's one more thing in here
there gonna be any more let's see oh my
gosh seriously they put more stuff in
here seriously they're crazy I can't
believe it holy moly okay I was like
there cannot be more eyeshadows in here
but there are unbelievable okay these
are just sample packs these are called
matte matte squared feminine enjoy these

called pretentious and this one is
called tawdry should I swatch these two
of course I have to swatch them too
running out of room on my hand they sent
so much this month okay save some time I
have already put the swatches on my
hands you're gonna keep them going up
the arms so oh my goodness all over my
hand make it a huge mess

the pretentious and then this one I
don't think I got as much product on
this finger it's hard at that little
tiny bag to get holy moly okay I got to
read you that one because that totally I
got to take my bracelet off I'm just
making a huge mess everywhere hold on
okay I haven't used my pinky finger yet

dusty blue matte gorgeous loo and that

little bit of purple in the crease hmm
blue and purple just looks those two
particular shades of blue and purple are
just gorgeous together I have my Kat Von
D Esperanza palette wherever that is
I'll know what I did with it but that
one has the purple in the blue
combination and all it's amazing so yeah
I mean laminar eyes totally overdid
themselves from a just unbelievable as
far as the amount of products let's just
review what we got we got three
lancaster caramels that will cause me to
drool we got the blush by Genova
cosmetics in that orange ii dusty color

$6 apiece on their website vanilla
unicorn one way ticket and insomnia and
we got the two samples of their new line
their extension of their line the matte
squared line the pretentious and the
tawny and then we got the little nail
polish sample so glamour doll eyes
knocks it out of the park from a just
unbelievable one thing I did want to
update you on is this lip gloss that I'm

pigman see gloss but want color this is
perfect for that that's the this is my
ideal lip gloss this is what I wanted a
lip gloss something that's not gonna
