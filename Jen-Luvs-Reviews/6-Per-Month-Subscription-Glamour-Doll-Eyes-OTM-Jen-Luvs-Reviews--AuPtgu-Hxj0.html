subscription service that I wanted to
show you it's not a new subscription
service they've actually been doing it
for like three years but I've never
heard of it and I'm really excited to
share it with you and it's by a company
called glamour doll eyes and when I
search on youtube because that's kind of
what i do when i whenever i hear of a
new company i look on youtube to see if
there's other reviews there's a lot of
reviews of glamour doll eyes a lot of
people with tutorials and all kinds of
stuff but I've never heard of it so I
was really excited when they contacted
me and wanted to send me a their eye
shadow of the month so this subscription
service is six dollars a month and it's
called otm meaning of the moment and it
is one mineral eyeshadow that they send
you and it is a limited edition color it
only comes out i believe for that
particular month and it is a surprise so
if you're looking for a less expensive
beauty subscription box and you like
mineral eyeshadow this may be something
for you i'm going to show you all about
i have actually already opened it's not
a true box opening because i wanted to
try it let you know what I thought of it
since it is a new product from a new
company for me so this one it comes with
this little card and I'll show you so
there you go this one is social suicide
is the name of this color you also get a
sample of social butterfly which is a
hydro glaze which is like a lip gloss it
says the description on the eyeshadow is
a semi-matte royal blue with a subtle
blue shift and silver Sparkle say for
face i spaced and nails which i think is
kind of interesting so this gloss is new
it's not on their virtual shelves yet
it's a special release in conjunction
with January's otm shadow color it's a
sheer red with the smallest hint of blue
sheen that is best applied with a lip
brush or doe foot applicator it's a
buttercream sense okay it says we put
our all into this product well little
goes a long way and I would definitely
agree with that because I have tried it
so let me show you the shadow first so
here is the shadow and there is no
sifter on here which makes it a little
bit more difficult but not impossible to
use I'm actually going to set the pot
behind me because I don't want to spill
it and I'm just going to take off of the
lid here to swatch see that's this
bright blue okay so there's the bright
blue on the finger swatch and let's do a
hand small
okay just really really pretty and again
I just took that off the cup the lid so
it's not a ton of product on there there
we go that's a little bit better it's a
beautiful beautiful blue so this is not
a color that I enjoy all over my lid
it's too much for me but what this color
is beautiful for is on my lower lash
line just to add a little pop of color I
think it's really really pretty it is
gorgeous in the pan I don't know if
you're going to be able to see that you
zoom it again oh so there it is in the
pan hopefully you can see how beautiful
that is I did try to use this in my
crease blend with some other colors and
it was too loud it didn't quite work it
was a little bit difficult to blend but
I think that just has to do with how
hardcore the pigmentation is in this
product I do think that I would really
love to try some of their shadows that
aren't as electric than just to see how
they compare in formula but overall I
did enjoy using it I just really feel
like I'm gonna limit using this
particular shade to just my lower lash
line just for that pop like I was saying
earlier now for the lip I've got to show
you this I'm gonna take my current lip
color off so that I can actually show
you this they gave this this it's just a
teeny tiny little sample is just a
little bonus let's take off my lip color
is it off mmm i'm matt okay so as much
as i can take my balm stain off alright
i ran out of battery so i had to start
over but hopefully my camera's still in
the right same spot oh no no no let's
make sure we're from focus here focus
focus focus alright so the lip product
what happened to lip product alright
here's a lip product so I can't find my
lip brush because i don't use lip
brushes and i can't find it all i could
find was a concealer brush and i just
don't want to use a concealer brush so
i'm just going to use my finger to apply
this you can see it's kind of like it's
it looks like it's really thick like it
might be sticky but it's not and they
say a little goes a long way and that is
so true that's all I'm going to use so
i'm going to use and watch I need a tad
tad tad bit more just a tiniest little
bit
and that's plenty then I look pretty
then I looks at Britta I love it and
such such such such such a pretty color
I would definitely be interested in
ordering these when they do end up on
the website i'm not sure if they're on
there yet but i'm going to look into it
because I really the formula it's not
sticky it's a tad bit on the way least I
but most lip glosses are but there's no
stickiness to it at all the way on it is
of a typical lip gloss there's nothing
fantastic there but I just really like
the shade and I like the way it smells
that whole cream eNOS smell so I'm
definitely gonna be looking into getting
some of these myself so that is what I
wanted to show you oh and I forgot to
show you they also sound like a couple
of little laffy taffys just for fun I
which I thought was really cute you know
a little added touch this is again six
dollars a month and its glamour doll
eyes and I just think it's a really cute
little subscription if you're looking
for you lent mineral eyeshadow and
you're looking for a cheap subscription
where you're just going to get some fun
in the mail little surprised you don't
want to pay ten dollars for ypsi your
Birchbox or 21 for boxy charm or
whatever it is so I would definitely
recommend this one I'm gonna look into
getting more these because I think that
it's really cool so thank you so much

glamour doll eyes i'm going to put their
link down below thank you to them for
sending this to me and hopefully i will
be showing you more of these in the
future if you enjoyed this video please
