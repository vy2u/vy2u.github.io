video this has been a highly requested
highly anticipated I've told you this is
coming forever but I really want to make
sure I did a thorough test of these
products before I presented them to you
so now my research has been completed
and I'm ready to present my information
to you these pallets from bad habit are
ten dollars and they're very comparable
in shape selection to the more expensive
products that you can buy it let's say
Sephora or Ulta so if you're interested
in that hang tight I'm gonna share with
you whether I think that you can
completely replace these higher-end
pallets with these less expensive
pallets or if you're better off
investing in the more expensive one
we're going to break it all down for you
right now before I get into the details
let me just show you what we're dealing
with here so this is the anasazi of
Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance palette
is $42 this is the bad habit Royals
palette is $10 take a look this is the
honest ozzie of Beverly Hills subculture
palette and this is the bad habit Beauty
retro love palette seeing a trend here
seeing a trend and then the last pile
we're gonna be talking about today the
Anastacio Beverly Hills prism palette
and the brand new bad habit or a palette
there they are
hmm very interesting but before we go
any further I do want to let you know
that the bad habit palettes were sent to
me by shop hush which is where you can
purchase these palettes they were sent
to me with no obligation to review just
hey try out our stuff if you want to
make a video this is not sponsored I'm
not being paid in any way to make this
video they did provide me with an
affiliate code that is down below that I
do earn money off of if you purchase
these palettes but honestly I want you
to buy what makes you happy that is way
more important to me so I'm gonna
present to you my hundred percent honest
thorough review of these and then you
can make your decision for yourself of
what's best for you like I mentioned
before
all of these products are sold at shop
hush calm but they also have besides bad
habit they have a lot of other brands I
was actually quite surprised at what
other brands they had they had just for
a few they have Beauty Blender Real
Techniques elf and NYX they also have a
bunch of K Beauty stuff you don't know
how much I love Mike a beauty Tony moly
Holika Holika Innisfree and attitude
house where some of the K beauty brands
on there they have tools they have
makeup products they have skincare they
have all kinds of stuff over there so
it's not just these pallets there's lots
of things that you can purchase over
there there is free domestic shipping
for orders of $25 or more from shop hush
under $25 it's a flat rate of 495
shipping they also do ship
internationally but it is a $20 shipping
cost there is no order minimum for that
though and it is not including customs
charges they say that it will take 8 to
10 business days within the US and 10 to
45 days international depending on what
country you live in and how far you are
from the US they do have a maximum of
two units per order so you can only
order two pallets at a time so you would
have to have an additional order if you
wanted to buy more than two pallets of a
specific kind they only accept returns
on unopened items if it looks like you
swatched it they will not accept returns
like I mentioned before we're looking at
a $10 price point for the rails palette
and the retro love toilet it's a $12
price point for the aura palette
unfortunately right now the retro love
and the aura are sold out they do have
the Royals palette available I did try
to reach out to shop hush to see a
restock date and they did not get back
to me yet if for some reason I do get
updated information I will put it in the
description box down below one thing I
think is very important to understand
which I've heard a lot of confusion in
the past is the difference between a
dupe palette and a counterfeit palette a
counterfeit palette may look exactly
like the original the exact same
packaging except for it may say aa
Nastasia with a Z the shade names may be
slightly different or there may be some
shades that are replaced where you know
maybe this one would be a black instead
of a brown something like that where
they're trying to say that it is the
exact same palette it's just a fake
version a dupe palette is not the same
thing this is a company that
has gotten inspiration from other brands
and created their own version of the
same palette of the same idea so it's
very very different everyone has their
own moral compass when it comes to those
kinds of things you just have to decide
what's right for you this is a
cruelty-free brand but the products are
made in the PRC which is the People's
Republic of China now oh yeah I also get
a lot of questions when I don't clarify
this you can have a cruelty-free product
made in China what that tells me is
these products are not sold in China
China has a law that if they're going to
see if you're going to sell a cosmetic
product in China you have to test it on
animals in order to sell it in China but
they can manufacture products and ship
them directly to other countries without
testing on animals that is what has
happened with these pallets just because
something says that It's Made in China
don't automatically assume that it is
terrible quality so for example Joo vs
place-a shadows that I absolutely love
made in the People's Republic of China
there's also a lot of drugstore products
that you don't realize are also made in
China so this is no different this is an
American company that outsources their
production to China there are quite a
few other pallets on their site that are
similar to other pallets so for example
their inferno palette is very similar to
the Urban Decay Naked heat pallet and
then the sugar pallet which is right
here is very similar to the sweet peach
palette by Too Faced so there's other
pallets on there
they're very similar to go to beauty
palettes things like that but for the
purposes of this video because this
video would be an hour and a half long
if I did all of them and it would
probably never get made because it would
take me too long to produce we're just
gonna focus on the ones that are similar
to the anastasi of Beverly Hills pallets
now when I looked at the ingredients for
these I didn't see anything out of the
ordinary for ingredients they're very
typical eyeshadow ingredients but I know
that there are certain ingredients that
people that watch my videos watch out
for so I'm gonna mention a few of those
for example they're all they all contain
both talc and mica they have
phenoxyethanol as the preservatives
there are no parabens all of the pallets
have pigments in them that are not lips
say for example the royals has
ultramarine blue and chromium oxide
the retro love has ultramarine blue and
ferric ferrocyanide and then the aura
palette has ultramarine blue and also
the ferric ferrocyanide so you would
have to check with bad habit to see or
with shop hush to see whether you know
which shades in here had those because
some people like to tap I shadow onto
their lips to give a pretty effect so
you probably don't want to do that
because they they aren't considered lips
safe some of those shades and we don't
know which ones also specifically the
Royals palette has tocopherol acetate
which gives some people an allergic
reaction if you've never had an allergic
reaction to eyeshadow chances are you're
not allergic to took ferrule acetate cuz
it's in a lot of eyeshadows and also the
retro love and the aura palettes both
have dimethicone I know some people
don't like dimethicone and they also
have a textile palmitate some of my
subscribers don't like to use palm oil
ingredients for environmental reasons
and also some people have allergic
reactions to that particular ingredient
so that is in the aura and the retro
love if you're curious about the anasazi
of Beverly Hills palette reviews from me
I do have reviews on all three of these
palettes I will link those down below in
case you want to hear more about these I
will tell you that the ingredient lists
from Anastacio to bad habit are very
very different they are not formula
dupes in any way it's not like bad habit
went in and completely stole honest
osseous formula that is not true that is
not real the formulas are very different
so now that I've given you a little bit
of information about the brand and about
the palettes themselves I really am very
very excited to show you the swatch
comparisons between these palettes so
let's go ahead and get into that right
now alright my friend it is time for
swatches which means it's time for the
swatch choice so sit back and relax and
enjoy the swatches we're gonna be
swatching today with the mac 242 brush
for the shimmers and the 239 brush for
the mattes but you'll notice sometimes
the 242 isn't really doing a good job
with the shimmer so I go back in with a
239 just so you can see how it builds
with a different brush this is the first
set of four from the Royals and modern
renaissance palette and you'll notice
that the tone of these palettes is
spot-on doop with the Anastacio palette
i mean they did a really good job over a
bad habit getting the exact
in color which I notice the biggest
difference in is pigmentation you notice
it right there with tempera and Treasury
I mean the pigmentation is completely
different
also with golden ochre and opulent same
thing this is the shimmer brush and
we'll go in these actually compare quite
nicely with premier and Queen I'm
actually quite happy with that
comparison and Primrose in Guam fresco
bonbon fresco I don't know
and there are about the same but Anasazi
it definitely has a leg up on
pigmentation with the difference between
these pallets and you'll see it with the
rest of the swatches as well now if
you're new to my channel you're new to
the wipe test and what this is supposed
to show you is how the shadows stain at
the skin so you'll see that the Anasazi
palette definitely stains the skin a bit
more which will probably lead to a
longer lasting power and we'll talk more
about that when I get to the review
going on to the next four and you'll see
again that the colors are spot-on
dupes they really are I mean it's it's
pretty amazing how close they got as far
as it being inspired but again you're
going to see that pigmentation
difference between the two palettes
honest alia definitely has more
pigmentation they go on smoother but you
also have to remember that that also
means that they go on really intense so
you might want to tap your brush a
little lighter in the Anasazi you might
be able to go a little more ham on the
bad habit because it isn't quite as
intense but man they're closed man
therefore they did a really good job
making these pretty much exactly the
same
and again with the wipe test you'll see
the pigmentation stains the skin or a
lot with the honest Asya it's mean
there's definitely standing with bad
habit but it's not as intense as with
the anastacio and the last set of four
you'll see I'm kind of skipping all over
the place with bad habit because they're
not in the exact same order as the
Anastacio but the anastasi I'm going in
order from top left to right top to
bottom
yeah rain just cannot keep up with red
ochre red ochre is insane it's a
gorgeous shape but it is the exact same
color it's just not as intense
same thing with Venetian red and regal
but those shimmer shades Primavera and
Crown they really are similar and burnt
orange and air really aren't mad I never
mind air is pretty weak compared to
burnt orange but you'll still be able to
get the same look it's just not going to
be as intense and same thing again with
the wipe test the consistency is the
same and that you are going to get a
longer lasting power at least I do with
the anastacio then the bad habit and
finally the last two i'm swatching these
a little bit differently just so that I
can get them done in one shot that I'm
actually going to squash these right
next to each other so brush swatch
forearm Tove it just goes on so
incredibly smooth same thing with rail
guard I mean just very very smooth and
now we're going to go into the bad habit
swatches right next to those instead
since I do have room for four on each
row and these actually keep up really
well as far as the finger swatches but
the brush washes again fall flat
compared to the Anastasio but again
they're the same exact shade it's just
not as intense
and with the white test you see that
they all do have a good lasting power I
mean you can see them all it's just the
honest Ozzy's gonna hang out longer
moving on to retro love and the
subculture palette I do want to start
off this by saying that I had some mixed
feelings about the subculture palette
and the ease of use for it
I really like the mattes wasn't as big
of a fan of the shimmers I feel the same
way about the prism but even more so
about the prism cube I had a lot of
trouble with finger swatches and brush
swatches it's more meant to be a topper
but with psychedelic you can see that
you can really use that all over the lid
but you can also use it as a topper
peace and dawn and destiny and hippie
we're seeing the exact same thing we did
with the the other palette with the
modern renaissance pellet dupe it's you
know it's just a little bit more weak
compared to the honest Asya version but
again the same color just I like
psychedelic better than cube but that's
just my personal preference and as we
wipe them away you'll see that the
darker shades hippie and revolution stay
the other two are pretty much gone but
dawn definitely stays a lot better than
peace and the second set of 4 we've got
these really 70s looking vibes which i
think is really cool that bad habit
caught on to that and and called it the
retro love palette because I got the 70s
vibe straight away from the subculture
as soon as I saw it you'll see there's
some chunkiness with the bad habit
palette it's not nearly as smooth as the
Anastasio but again same exact colors
you see the Anasazi one's kind of
flopping all over the place at the
bottom of the swatch and that's just
because the pigmentation is just
insanely intense with the Anasazi o1 but
again colors are very very close the
pigmentation and the finger swatches
look kind of similar but when you look
at the brush swatches there's a
significant difference especially the
mercury and pop and accessing free love
I mean what even has that brushed watch
for free love I don't even know so moral
the story so far is that you're
definitely paying for a higher quality
with a Nastasia and with the white test
it reinforces it further
you are going to get a more intense look
from the Anastacio and the final four
here we have electric fudge a new wave
and untamed from Anastacio and their
dupes icon youth fab and mod and again i
like icon better than electric i feel
like it's more intense because electric
is really meant to be a topper which is
not my personal preference
I feel like icons easier to work with
easier to get color to show up but
that's just me personally like fab keeps
up pretty well with new wave but I mean
untamed in mod there's just no
comparison there's no comparison between
untamed in mod untamed is night and day
so much more beautiful than mod as far
as the intensity of pigmentation but
again same shade man same shade
and as we wipe them away exact same
story we're seeing the same story that
the anastacio this it's not coming off
my arm of course it comes off with
makeup remover but it is not going at
all and the final two with these two
pallets the retro love and the
subculture sorry it's blurry a little
bit but it came back these are these
mats from this palette are just the
pigmentation is unreal it really is so
keeping up with that at the price point
that bad habit needs to keep up with
them is I don't even know how they got
this close to be completely honest with
you but you can definitely see the
difference in quality as far as the
pigmentation goes you can really see it
with these that there is a big
difference between the two as far as
pigmentation especially with rowdy and
nostalgia I mean nostalgia can't even
hold a candle to rowdy as far as the
intensity of pigmentation
and wiping them away again same story
edge and rowdy hang on better but
nostalgia actually surprisingly keeps up
better than I thought it would and
finally on to the very last two pallets
we have the aura palette and the prism
palette now I will tell you right now
that I definitely like the aura palette
better than any of the other bad habit
palettes you're gonna see how well it
keeps up with the anastasiya so
phenomenon again just kicks loose its
but in my mind I mean it lucid is meant
to be a topper and phenomenon is just
phenomenal and then we go on to the
other ones and you can see there I don't
know what's going on with this formula
but it's definitely better I mean Sphinx
is just blessed if you watch my full
review of the prism palette you'll see I
had the same problem with the swatches I
have the same problem with the
performance on the eyes I know swatches
aren't everything but they do give an
indication of the the ability of the
shadows to apply I know a lot of people
say that swatches don't matter I don't
agree at all and I'm gonna stick with
that I do think that they matter I do
think they give a hint but they're not
the whole story moving on to the next
set of 4 I love this set of 4 I think it
is so unique and fun but I have to say I
like the bad habit ones more I mean you
can see if you like a deep deep black
you're really gonna like the immortal
over obsidian I mean look at the brush
swatch bro Cyrus it's just weak I always
apply Osiris with a fingertip it works
so much better but you don't need that
with destiny destiny applies beautifully
with a brush on the eyes spear
definitely is by far better than energy
that's one that I feel like honest Asya
definitely beats bad have it on but man
I mean you look at these things
and I really feel like bad habit looks
better a lot and it applies better I
mean you guys you'll see in the demo in
a minute because I do use these two
palettes and then we're gonna go into
the white test and you'll see sphere is
definitely better than energy I mean it
just is it's just better but other than
that they look pretty comparable
and then on to the last set of four
parallel pyramid throne and Saturn
compared to vibes soul ecstasy and
mystique oh my gosh
I love this set of four I love it it is
so fun and the intensity of the
pigmentation of all of the shades it's
just it's incredible throne and ecstasy
are not exact dupes there's actually a
little bit of a difference as far as the
undertones and the intensity of them I'd
like ecstasy better I have to say it
applies better with a fingertip and with
a brush oh I needed to build up throne
with the other brush but I didn't need
to build up ecstasy so I just put it on
the top of my arm I don't know it was
kind of a weird choice but that's what I
did so that's what's there but oh my
gosh I mean just it definitely keeps up
I mean mystique doesn't really keep up
this Saturday but I feel like the veep's
up with parallel and I think Pyramid and
groan aren't as good as soul and ecstasy
that's just my personal opinion and this
is representative of what happens on the
eye it's not just the swatches and
wiping them away
pyramid it definitely hangs on better
than soul here but other than that
they're pretty much exactly the same and
then the very last two we have eternal
versus Laura and manifest manifest
versus haze and you see that the brush
swatch for Laura is just wow
and you can see allure and eternal kind
of both don't swatch very good and
manifest and haze same thing they're
very similar in their not as goodness as
some of the other shades in this palette
but I mean I think that they definitely
compare here and they compare on the
eyes as well it's not just the swatches
like I said before I think I like
manifests just a little bit better than
haze but I think you turn inland Laura
are about the same they both need to be
tapped on with a finger in my opinion
when you wipe them away you can still
kind of tell the difference with
manifests but for the rest they kind of
look the same between the two palettes
so now you've seen those side-by-side
swatches maybe get into some opinions
about how you feel about this I'm gonna
go ahead and show you a demo of how I
got this look today I got so many
requests to do this look on camera I did
wear this look in other videos I think a
week or two ago and people were saying
what's on your eyes please do a tutorial
so I very rarely get people requesting a
specific look that many people are
requesting a specific look so I figured
I would do it for this video the entire
eye look on this side is from the aura
palette the entire eye look on this side
is the prism palette so let's go ahead
and I will show you side by side how
these eye shadows apply to the eye
welcome to ASMR voice part 2 the demo so
we're gonna start off with the Mac Paint
Pot in painterly and put that on both
sides and I am gonna be showing you both
sides at the same time which was an
editing nightmare but it looks very cool
when it's finished so we're gonna put
the aura palette on the left side of the
screen and the Anastacio prism palette
on the right side of the screen and as
you can see I'm dipping into the deep
shades and applying them with a motive
fluffy brush from their prismatic
collection I love these brushes they're
super fab and they go on pretty much the
same and then we move into destiny and
Osiris and padding that on to the outer
corner I like destiny so much better you
can see Osiris is just going on really
patchy with my fingertip where destiny I
just have to be careful of the fallout
because it's just very very intense and
then that lighter purple shade ethereal
and dimension on the
inner corner you can really see this
off-camera more even more than you can
see it on camera especially from far
away these shades compare but I still
like ethereal better I feel like it is
just more intense and foiled and just
kind of a backed up shot of how it's
looking so far moving on to mystique and
Saturn putting that up above the crease
and just kind of warming up the look a
bit mystique actually seems to be
applying a little bit more intense it
might just because I have more my brush
though I just notice the fallout from
the bad habit palette and I did have to
wipe that away it took me a little while
there definitely is more fallout I've
found with the bad habit version so
we're using unity on the brow bone just
to kind of soften out the harshness of
that orange --red shade and then
phenomenon and loose it in the inner
corner I really like phenomenon better
than lucid it's just more intense and
more beautiful for me personally and
then on the lower lash line just
throwing that Brown down they do apply
pretty much the same and that's the
finished look without liner and lashes
just not super complex but I really like
this look a lot I think it kind of came
out really pretty and it's not very hard
to do so there it is close-up without
liner and lashes and I really do like
the bad habits I'd better to be
completely honest with you I just think
that the shimmers really push it over
the top I'm gonna go ahead and put on
liner and lashes and there's that look
and we're going to zoom in again on both
sides and again I really just think the
pigmentation and intensity of the bad
habit one for the shimmer shades is
better I do think honest alia beats out
bad habit on the mattes though and now
here's just me smiling and posing and
trying to be a beauty guru so I hope you
found that demo helpful let's go ahead
into the full review
now you're ready for my opinion on these
pallets because I have been thinking and
thinking and thinking and thinking for
weeks and weeks and weeks about this and
I'm finally getting a chance to share it
with you so let's go ahead and start
with the Royals palette I use this three
different times I did not use this a ton
when I did test it I did try to use a
variety of different shades I can tell
you that I feel like it applies the
application is very very close to the
modern renaissance as far as the looks
that you can create the modern
renaissance definitely has a buttery ER
texture is that a word buttery er I
don't think so but it's really really
creamy and very soft where this one
isn't quite as soft it is soft but not
quite as soft as this you don't have to
be as delicate with this as you do with
this the shade matching is very very
close I will say though there is a
distinct difference in lasting power
this one will last you probably six to
eight hours before significant fading
this one lasts me all day long no
problem my eye look looks pretty much
exactly the same at the end of the day
as it does the beginning of the day wear
this one I absolutely cannot say that
about there are significant fading by
the end of the day I mean it's just it
just doesn't look good anymore and you
can really tell a difference so if that
matters to you you're gonna want to
spring for the honest on the arm so it's
definitely worth it if you need that all
day morning tonight wear but if you're
just looking to create the same look
have you seen a mana Renaissance look
online and you want to recreate it I
really don't see of difference or a
reason to purchase this when you can buy
this and one thing I want to say on that
note is that not everybody has the means
to spend 42 dollars on an eyeshadow
palette this is a great option for
people that just just can't do it it's
just not it's just not a logical thing
to do for this because you will be able
to create a lot of the same looks it's
just like I said again the lasting power
is just not fabulous throughout the day
going in with retro love which is the
one that's very similar to the
subculture palette I actually found this
a bit easier to work with in the
subculture the subculture I had some
trouble with the shades kind of mushing
together and graying out I can tell you
I did not have as much of a problem with
the retro love palette if I
get it open for you I just I didn't have
as much trouble with it it was a little
bit easier to use because again the
shadows just aren't as soft
unfortunately the same thing is with the
Royals palette the lasting power on this
one was not as good as with this one it
made me so sad because I saw how easy it
was to get these shadows to not muddy
into one another I was like yes I'm so
excited and then when it faded down I
was like wow that made me sad but again
same thing like with the other palette
with the Royals palette you can get very
if not identical looks very very similar
looks with both palettes and you really
don't need the subculture unless you
really want that lasting power that's my
personal opinion
now the aura palette I have to tell you
this one is my absolute favorite of
those three this one here I still had
some trouble with you'll see in my full
review if you decide to watch it I had
some trouble with the shimmer shades or
a palette they go on very opaque very
easily with a brush and with the
fingertip I do like shimmer shades with
my fingertips but I know some people
don't but I found you can apply these
with a brush beautifully I found this
this palette is very finicky both with a
brush and a fingertip it takes some time
for me to build it up to what I like I
would honestly purchase the aura palette
over the the prism palette just because
this formula is stellar it's really
really good and lasting power was
exactly the same it lasted me all
stinking day I don't know what they did
there actually do you know what they did
I've looked at the ingredients but the
tweaks that they made in the formula for
this just on the money for example like
the shade phenomenon the white one and
the shade lucid loose it's more of like
a topper where phenomenon can hold its
own all by itself and that's my personal
preference if you like toppers you'll
probably like this one better I
personally like extremely pigmented very
punchy eyeshadows so this one is
definitely for me
so for final thoughts I would definitely
recommend the aura palette I think it's
fabulous when this comeback comes back
in stock if you were interested in the
prism I would highly recommend this one
I think with retro love and Royals you
have to kind of
what I've said and see whether you feel
like these are right for you
if the Anasazi palates are not in your
budget of course I would definitely
recommend these if you need that day
tonight look and the Anasazi ax pellets
are within your budget I would recommend
those over these but if those are not in
your budget and you don't need that day
tonight complete you know still looking
beautiful at the end of the night I
definitely think that these are
wonderful palettes I think you'll really
enjoy them you'll be able to make a
great attempt every creating looks
online with these the ones that were
from the Anasazi palettes I think you're
gonna be very happy with them and
overall I'm just very excited about this
brand I'm very happy to see them because
it gives access to a whole new group of
people to be able to have fun with these
kinds of colors and I think it's super
cool there's always going to be a market
for high-end makeup for luxury makeup
there's always gonna be people who would
rather have the anastacio over the bad
habit ones I don't think that these are
going to make honest Asya and other
brands go out of business because they
are similar I think there is a market
for these but there's also a market for
you know these so that's just my
personal thoughts I would love to know
your thoughts in the comments below what
do you think about bad habit versus
honest Asya and other brands do you feel
like this is a great idea do you feel
like this is a terrible idea I would
love to know your thoughts if you've
ever tried any of these palettes from
bad habit I would love to know your
