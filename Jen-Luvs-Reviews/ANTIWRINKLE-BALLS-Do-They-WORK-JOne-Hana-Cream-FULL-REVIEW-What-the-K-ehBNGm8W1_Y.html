the K where we test out Korean skincare
to see whether it is worth your hard
earned money and we've got an expensive
one this week so stay tuned this week on
what the K we're going to be looking at
the J 100
anti wrinkle effect intense capsule
cream I've never seen anything quite
like this according to the ad on
Sephora's website where this was
purchased the capsule thing is getting
really big in Korea and it's just
starting to come to the states j1 is an
actress over in Korea and she's very
very famous so this is her skincare line
she wanted something that would be on
the go easy to use because she's such a
busy person so as you can see the way
that this works is that there are these
little tiny balls of skincare goodness
in here and you take the bowl out with
this little teeny tiny plastic spatula
scoopy thingy and then you squish it in
your hands and then you spread it all
over in your face we're gonna test it
I'm going to show you how it works in a
little while up but I do want to tell
you some details about this product
before we test it out I will link a time
stamp down below if you want to go
straight to the test so this is the j1
Hana cream it's $50 it's a four you get
one point four ounces of product which
ends up being $35 and 46 per ounce which
is a little on the expensive side for
example the fresh Lotus youth preserve
face cream with super 7 complex is $28
and 75 cents an ounce the belief aqua
balm and the moisturizing balm as well
as the clinic Moisture Surge those run
you about 23 dollars an ounce so this
one at $35 an ounce is much more
expensive it's much more comparable or
comparable however you want to say that
to the drunk elephants la la retro
whipped cream which is $60 for the
product but you do get a little bit more
product so they actually end up being
almost exactly the same value we talked
about ingredients
the number one ingredient in this is
water the second ingredient is macadamia
oil I did a little bit of research on
macadamia tuile I will put all of the
websites where I found this information
down in the description I am NOT a
cosmetic chemist I just learned things
by looking them up on the internet so I
do the best that I can based on my
personal resources so this is from the
naked chemist calm they said its
chemical profile is very similar to that
of human sebum it's palmitoleic and
oleic acid profile makes it the perfect
choice for mature or dry skin
phytosterols are protective aiding in
skin recovery they work like cortisone
on the skin helping to ruse it reduce
itchiness and inflammation if I can
speak tonight and linoleic fatty acid
content makes it great for skin that has
difficulty retaining moisture but being
macadamia oil if you are allergic to
tree nuts you definitely do not want to
buy this product additionally on
LIVESTRONG comm they say using macadamia
nut oil topically firms your skin while
maintaining a youthful glow the second
and greens that I want to talk to you
about is the sunflower seed oil that's
also in there has essential fatty acids
that can help maintain the skin barrier
and decrease water loss and then we have
palm oil in there some people are very
anti palm oil because of the way that
it's harvested on learning that in the
comment sections from you all that some
of you are very anti palm oil so that is
in here shea butter is in here and
niacinamide is another one that's quite
high up this is from polished choice
also known as vitamin b3 it is a very
effective skin restoring ingredient that
offers multiple benefits for aging skin
among those benefits is the ability to
visibly improve the appearance of
enlarged pores uneven skin tone fine
lines dullness and a weakened skin
surface and then truth and aging goes
even further into that I will put more
information down below because I don't
want to go on and on forever with the
ingredients some negatives for this
product cyclo penta siloxane it is a
silicone there air sarsen
bioaccumulation concerns there with that
again link down below
propyl propylene glycol which is skin
conditioning there is an irritation
concern on that one and then glycerin
olan olan 8 is also one has skin
irritation concerns but other than that
there are a ton of ingredients in this
again I will list those down below in
case you want to see all of the
ingredients so now let me show you how
this works I do have some makeup on my
face but I do just want to show you real
quick how it works I don't feel like
washing my face and being on camera with
my washed face in order to do this you
have to use the spoon you can't reach
your fingers in there and grab one of
the balls or else they will crush
immediately so you take the ball and you
go like this and you rub it like that
and see how it completely just broke up
on my hands and then you just rub it all
over your face
just like that and you can rub down your
neck I read some reviews of this and
people are saying that it works really
well mixed with a Beauty oil like the
fresh sea berry moisturizing face oil or
the josie maran argan oil people with
really dry skin are seeming to need more
spheres because one sphere supposed to
be enough but if you have really dry
skin they say you can use up to two but
some people are saying they need to use
3 which makes you have to use a lot more
of it so you run out of it a lot faster
so that's a real negative for people
with very dry skin if you're concerned
about how fast you're using up the
product because you're supposed to
they're supposed to be already measured
for you so you know exactly how much to
use so the idea is that you're not
wasting product but you may need more if
you have extra dry skin now as far as my
personal review and what I thought of
this I think it feels great on the skin
it's got a more of a hydration oiliness
than some moisturizers that I've used
but and it takes a minute to seep into
the skin but when it does it really does
feel nice it has a very light floral
scent but if you're very sensitive to
scents it may be too strong for you I
love the way it feels but I can tell you
dramatic anti-wrinkle effect is not
happening I have not seen anything
dramatic there's a I'm being more
dramatic now in my voice then this thing
is on my face look it is there's no
drama there's no drama here you know no
T to be saved about this there's nothing
really happened as far that but it does
feel really good so if you want
nice hydrating feeling of moisture on
your face you like the idea of the
spheres I definitely recommend you might
want to try it out but I don't think it
is worth any kind of big hype it's more
fun than anything I'm very thankful to
have it I don't think that I will be
buying this when I run out of it it's
just not going to happen but I'll have
fun using it while I do so you're gonna
have to kind of take into your own
personal you know what do you think
about you know this particular product
whether it's something you want to try
or not but for me it was just it's nice
to use but it's definitely nothing
magical I want to thank you so much for
watching what the K this week next week
we're going to be discussing the holy Co
holy Co sweet cotton pour cover BB cream
it is a BB cream that smells like cotton
candy I'm not kidding I'm not kidding I
used it a couple of times and I'm gonna
keep using it I can give you a full
review on this product I hope you
enjoyed what the K if you did definitely
subscribe so you don't miss next week
and mad love and I'll see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
