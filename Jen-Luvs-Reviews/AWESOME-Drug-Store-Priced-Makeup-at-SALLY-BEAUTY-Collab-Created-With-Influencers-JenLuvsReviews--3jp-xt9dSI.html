the collab line this is a Sally Beauty
drugstore price line this was a line
that was created in collaboration with
eight influencers on YouTube they had
supposedly a hand in creating this but
now I've put some of these products to
the test and I'm ready to share my
opinions with you so hang tight we're
gonna get started with that right now as
soon as I heard this line existed I knew
it was something that I wanted to try
and review because I am a big advocate
for influencers working with brands to
improve products and make them better
for customers so this is kind of what
I've always wanted to see from brands
who's really excited to see this there
were eight different youtubers that were
involved in this I will have all of
their announcement videos and their
channels linked below in case you'd like
to check them out some of the ones that
I had heard of before were what would
Lizzie do coffee break with Danny and ex
sparkage those were the ones that I
either have previously been subscribed
to or I'm currently subscribed to now
the first video that I saw on this line
was from coffee break with Danny so I
decided to not just pick random items
off of the website because there's a lot
of products anything you could possibly
want from primers and foundations and
concealers and brow pencils and
lipsticks and lipglosses and really
anything you can think of that they make
for makeup collab probably has it so
instead of just picking randomly I went
with the things that Danny had
recommended with collaborations with
youtubers there's different levels of
involvement so I just want to share with
you the involvement of these influencers
heads the story is that they were all
flown to New York in February for three
days to test products do a photo shoot
for the line things like that supposedly
the group got along great that was a
report from like all the videos I
watched them all they met they tested
the formulas they did swatches they
provided feedback and then about a month
later they all got boxes of samples to
again test and give feedback all from
their homes remotely to the company for
improvement and then the clav line came
out in October according to a couple of
the influencers there is a plan for
another two more lines the spring line
and then the fall line
20:18 they are a cruelty-free brand but
they are not vegan we'll talk a little
bit more about that when we get into
ingredient analysis now as far as the
parent company being cruelty-free you
kind of have to take it for what it is
Sally Beauty Supply is a distributor of
all kinds of products just like Ulta and
Sephora and a lot of beauty supply
stores they supply things that are
cruelty free and not cruelty free so
they do profit from products that are
not cruelty free but as does Ulta and
Sephora and CVS and pretty much anywhere
you could buy cosmetics unless you buy
it directly from the cosmetic
manufacturer so it's up to you how much
you want to you know take that to heart
cuz I know with like to face for example
because they're owned by Estee Lauder
some people do not buy Too Faced and do
not consider them to be cruelty-free but
just so you know the collab line is
cruelty free which means that they do
not test on animals this line is
available both in store and online and
the price range is from $6.99 to $19.99
they have a little set that's $19.99 but
the individual products I think go up to
like 1699 something like that
let's talk about the products that I
purchased so this is the shape and shade
ultrafine brow pencil in rich brown it
is $9.99 it does come in six shades then
I have this eyeshadow palette this is
the pro eyeshadow palette this is in the
shade first impressions there are four
different palettes available and I just
wanted to go with the purple one cause I
like purple it is $14.99 it's one of the
more expensive products in the line next
up we have the high rise in scene length
mascara it does come in three shades
black extreme black and black Brown mine
is just in regular black and then the
full body lipstick they do come in matte
and satin finishes I got one matte and
one satin I will be trying those on for
you so we have binge Worthy and then we
have really and you can see the shade
colors on the bottom which I really
really like there's nothing is more
frustrating when you're in a hurry in
the morning and you don't know what
lipstick it is you've got a bunch of em
they look the same you gotta open them
all up and roll them up to figure out
where your lipstick is and put burr so
it's really nice to have it on the
bottom so you can just kind of store
them this way and then you can see
exactly what you're looking at so that's
very very nice I like that these are
$10.99
each and they come in 16 shades and on
the website they are clearly labeled as
matte or satin I know that some
drugstore brands will just kind of put
it with say some of them are matte some
of them are satin but you don't really
know until you take them home
clap does a really nice job of labeling
them now I'm going to go ahead and show
you how I put on the products today on
my face I am wearing the brow product
the mascara all only this eye shadow
palette I didn't use any other
eyeshadows but this one and the
lipsticks of course and yeah that's it
all the things I'm wearing all the
things on my face why didn't I just say
that I don't know so I'm going to go
ahead and play that for you right now
you
all right y'all ready for some swatches
so let's break down this eyeshadow
palette just a little bit more than the
other product so as you can see you get
eight shadows in this palette you get
three matte shades which are shades
number one four and seven and shade
number two has a little bit of very
finely milled glitter in it but you
really can't see it on the eye and then
shades number three five six and eight
are all like a satin finish there are no
shades in here that have a chunky
glitter in them and I haven't
experienced any fallout throughout the
day of glitter down on my face so let's
take a look at the top four shades these
are just labeled shades one two three
and four and we're gonna finger swatch
them first and then we're going to brush
swatch them and the swatch of the first
one is absolutely beautiful just a great
great matte shade the second shade is
also very nice the third shade is a
little patch here / a lot of satin
shades it's just not quite as opaque as
when you Pat it on with a fingertip and
then the final shade is another
beautiful matte this is the first row
all together and as you can see this is
the row that really leans more purple
where the rest of the palette is
actually more gray toned if you're new
to my channel you're new to the wipe
test the purpose of this is to show kind
of simulate what it would look like
through a whole day's worth of wear and
as you can see all of these shades
actually hang out there really really
well I'm especially impressed with the
very light shade because a lot of times
those will easily wipe away moving on to
the second row and as you can see the
satiny shades really do have a beautiful
finish but there really isn't a lot of
tonal variation between shades of 5 6 &amp;amp;
7 which is kind of disappointing I cut
right to the finished brush swatches
here like I was saying a minute ago
there really isn't a whole lot of
difference between shades 5 6 &amp;amp; 7
shade 5 is a little bit lighter shade 6
&amp;amp; 7 really just as the difference
between a shimmer and a matte I wish
that they had had a little bit of tonal
variation in here and then the last one
of course is very light now here is the
white test and again you can see all of
the shades
can barely see shade number eight there
but it's very very light so that's
extremely typical now that you have seen
the products being applied and heard
some of my opinions let's go ahead and
get into an ingredient analysis as I'm
also going to be doing my review at the
same time as the ingredients cuz the
ingredient part is gonna be pretty short
so let's go ahead and start with the eye
shadow palette because that's the thing
that I was most interested in so it is a
talc based product the ingredient list
is really weird and that after talc on
the website it does talk about pigments
right after that usually the pigments
are always listed last so I thought that
was very very odd oh no unfortunately I
did misplace the box for this so I
couldn't look on the box to see whether
they were listed in the same order or
not on the actual box but we do know
that this is a talc based product it
also includes mica one thing to know
about this entire line pretty much
almost everything in the line
phenoxyethanol is the preservative that
do seem to be paraben free there are
ultra Marines in this which means that
it's not lip safe
the only ingredient in here that I saw
that was kind of a red flag for me for
some people is the tocopherol acetate
which is a vitamin E some people are
sensitive to that ingredients to be
careful if you are there are some
toxicity concerns with vitamin E but the
research is very mixed as far as whether
those are legitimate for how much
tocopherol acetate is actually in
cosmetic products so but just so you
know as far as the performance of this
eyeshadow I really really enjoy this
palette I think that it's very good for
drugstore eyeshadow I think that if
you're going to school or work and
you're not trying to look like you just
walked off of a runway this is a really
great option personally my personal
favorite eye shadows are super punchy
super poppy super bowl punch it and I
with some color Jiu vias place coloured
raine like bam in your face you know
that's the stuff that I really like nota
Tasha to Nonna stuff like that this is
not that this is going to be a little
more subtle think Too Faced think Tarte
this is one of the best quality
eyeshadow palettes I've ever tried from
the drugstore there are some NYX pellets
that come close that I feel like are
equal ish equal ish in quality what else
some of the wet and wild trios
would say our similar quality to this
but I honestly really like this better
than the wet-and-wild trios just soon
I got a lay it out they're gonna tell
you the truth but I mean really and
truly it is a really nice formula I
think they did a fantastic job I was
pleasantly surprised just because I
really had a bad time with drugstore
eyeshadows in the past I've never had
much faith in them but yeah I mean
definitely pleasantly surprised when oh
by the way I just want to mention as far
as NYX NYX does have some different
formulas of eyeshadows I'm talking about
their more pro formula that I feel like
it compares to not there like cheaper
junkier formula there's multiple
formulas I'll show you I'll link some
palettes that down below that I really
like the NYX formula like the UM the
avant-garde on pop palettes are pretty
really good and being there's like a pro
formula that's really good those are the
ones I'm talking about not not like the
junkie formula so if you are just
looking for a nice everyday wearable
eyeshadow formula this is definitely
something I would recommend I think it's
a great alternative to the higher-end
products so let's move on to the
lipstick so the lipsticks of one thing
you want to be careful with the
ingredients is there is a lanolin based
ingredient in here called called
isopropyl Lana laid that is from lanolin
lanolin is harvested from sheep's wool
so what they do is they shear the sheep
and then like right where the sheep was
touching the wool there is like a
secretion called lanolin that's like
this goopy stuff and people women use it
nursing mothers use it there's a lot of
like bye-bye cuties agave lip mask I the
best damn beauty lip mask those are
lanolin based lip product so for me it's
a great ingredient for my lips I really
enjoy having it but if you're allergic
to sheep's wool or if you're vegan or if
you just don't like that ingredient
because you think it's creepy you
definitely don't want to get these
lipsticks because it is in there there's
also an ingredient called BHT which
there's some irritation concerns there
is some mixed research on whether or not
it causes cancer but I will link that
article down below so you can read that
because that's a very freaky thing for
me to say so I will link that down below
but again it's like back and forth back
and forth back and forth with it so read
that down below and you'll have to make
up your own mind I personally don't have
a problem with it based on the research
that I've done but I do want you to be
educated and
make that decision for yourself so link
down below on that other than that
that's it four ingredients for lipsticks
that I wanted to mention I will tell you
I really like this formula too it's
really really good I like the matte and
the satin they're both really nice they
go on super smooth I feel like I've had
these for like a couple of weeks and I
feel like as they've gotten a little bit
older they're not quite as creamy as
they were when I first bought them but
they're still very creamy I wouldn't
compare them to high-end lipsticks as
far as the application of them and the
overall hydration but they're really
nice lipsticks especially for drugstore
price that lipsticks I really enjoyed
them I love the way they wear down they
do leave a little bit of a stain on the
lips which I personally really like
because after the lipstick moisture and
the hydration has kind of worn away you
still have this like really pretty stain
of the color especially with the deeper
shade and I just I'm really enjoying
them a lot a lot more than I thought I
would hydration is nice for both of them
even the matte one there is some
hydration to it which I appreciate of
course they don't like dry down they're
not transfer proof their lipsticks but
they're really nice formula this is
actually if I were gonna purchase
something else that I think I would use
I would definitely purchase the
lipsticks I feel like this is I feel
like would eyeshadow I've got a lot of
high-end eyeshadows that I really really
love so I don't think I'm gonna purchase
any more of these and even though I do
like them but I think I might purchase
more of the lipsticks because I'm really
enjoying them especially if like a color
particularly calls to me that I don't
own in my collection which okay let's be
honest I probably already own it but
okay Jen you don't need them
anti-consumerism you don't need anymore
but I would be tempted to buy more of
these on an impulse buy I would all
right Jen move it on before you end up
going online and buying some more
lipsticks okay let's talk about the
mascara a little bit as you saw in the
demo it's a very thick mascara it can
get very clumpy but I don't mind that
personally because I have these little
tiny wimpy lashes there they're like
just lame lashes my children both have
beautiful lashes and I'm so jealous but
my lashes are just a mess there's
nothing there and this makes me look
like I actually have lashes no mascara
really makes me look like I have false
lashes but this comes pretty stinking
close
but again it is that clumpy er formula
think better than sex by two-face I
would really like to put this
head-to-head with that as far as
performance goes because I really like
it it's really good and I feel like I'm
just you know I'm saying it's really
good it's really good is really good but
I do have something negative about this
and it's the way that it comes off kind
of freaks me out a little bit and you do
have to use an oil-based eye makeup
remover in order to take it off at least
that's been my experience I usually have
to use it more than one time and it
comes off in these weird odd random
flakes I did have one get in my eye and
it was kind of uncomfortable for a few
minutes before I flushed it out
so this one the removal process I don't
like but the performance of it I really
like I haven't had I'm not one that gets
a lot of flaking or smudging so I'm not
really a good person to judge for
flaking and smudging but for the record
I haven't had either happened to me and
overall I'm really really liking I just
hate taking it off so I've probably not
repurchase this because I there's so
many mascaras that I really like just as
much as this not better but just as much
as this but removed nicer so I probably
wouldn't repurchase this as far as
ingredients in the mascara this one is
also not vegan there's beeswax there's
also palmitic acid I know some of my
subscribers don't buy anything with palm
oil derivatives for environmental
reasons so it does have palmitic acid it
also has something called ammonia methyl
propane at y'all I think I said that
right I'm hoping I did and there's an
irritation concern with that so if you
do find that this that ingredient causes
irritation or if you know that you're
that one who calls you irritation you
want to stay away from this and then
finally cyclo penta siloxane which is if
you are very environmentally conscious
some products will include this it has
been found to bioaccumulate in sea life
if you want to be really environmentally
conscious you want to remove it with an
oil-based makeup remover and a cotton
pad but the thing about that is is that
it takes a lot for it to come off that
way you really need to splash it with
water in order to get it to completely
come off of your eyes so you're kind of
if you're really environmentally
conscious you'll really only have one
choice to really get it off which is to
let it go down the sink so depending on
where you fall on that then this is
definitely going to be a deal-breaker
there and then finally the brow product
so the only ingredients in this that
we're kind of like me with the scorable
Paul
metate which is another palm oil
derivative and this is the only product
that I tried without phenoxyethanol so
if you don't like phenoxyethanol you're
fine on this one now this was very
interesting I had to hand type the
ingredients for this they're not listed
on the website I had to go on the box
and what I found was this seems to be a
stock formula so let me tell you some
things some other ones that are very
very similar if not exactly the same so
we've got the beauty session which is an
indie brand $16 pink dust cosmetics 16
dollars the brow bar brow the finer
pencil is $25 yeah the Tarte Amazonian
clay waterproof brow pencil is $21 exact
same formula the Alltel ultra slim brow
pencil $10 also exact same formula and
the self love cosmetics which is another
ND brand is $21 for this so if you like
the Tarte formula or if you've tried the
bubble brow bar one and you've been
paying $25 for it stop because you can
get the Alta brow pencils the same one
or you can get this one and also I think
that it's gonna be also about which one
matches your hair color the best I found
this one to match my hair color pretty
well and I do like this brow pencil I've
kind of found that I either really like
a brow pencil or I don't and there's a
lot of them that I do really like I
really like the next one I really like
the Anastasio one there's a quite a few
of them I like I really like tattoo face
chocolate brownie one I really like some
of the benefit ones I really like this
one it's a good pencil I do find that
it's one that builds up nicely where you
don't have to worry about it going on
like ink and then you're like oh my gosh
well girls I got a little brows and they
came out of nowhere you know it's not
like that so that's kind of nice that it
kind of builds and you can make it
darker as you go I like that it goes on
very smooth and it's but it's not too
thick and creamy that it kind of gets
stuck in the brow hairs it makes it look
really weird the spoolie gone here is a
good solid spoolie no complaints there
it is one of those roll-up ones which
overall roll up brow pencils are
probably one of the worst value for brow
products just in general I didn't do
price programmer and for any of this
stuff because the video just would have
been too long to do all of that but just
so you know if you do want a better
value for brow products you want to
from these roll-up pencils in general
and go with either a a pomade or a
powder brow product and it is a very
nice product I mean they did it did a
good job with it I can't complain so I
have to tell you I was pleasantly
surprised by this line because you know
I'm gonna you know I tested these things
for what three we cuz I've been testing
these products and I really liked them I
think they're great I don't think I'm
gonna buy anything else from the line
just because I feel like I've already
done the review on them and I you know
don't want to do a bunch of videos on
the same brand unless there's a specific
request for something new maybe when
they're spring line comes out if there's
interest I'll go back in and get some
things from the spring line if you all
want me to but overall it's a definite
recommend for all these products I was
like oh go Sally Beauty you know and
it's nice to have some good high quality
products at the drugstore so you don't
have to spend you know twenty-one
dollars on a tarte product or you know a
two-faced eyeshadow pallete I mean
really and truly I would compare these
to the Too Faced and tart formulas
they're they're really wonderful not the
foiled formula from from Tarte but the
regular matte and shimmer shades so now
I'm going to turn the conversation over
to you if you've tried anything from the
collab line I would love to know about
it down in the comments below what have
you tried what have you thought about it
so far let's all learn together in the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
so that we can all have the best
knowledge on these products as possible
so thank you so much for watching this
video I hope you enjoyed it if you did
definitely make sure you give it a
thumbs up because it makes me look
really cool in the YouTube algorithm I
really appreciate it and if you're not
already subscribed you can click the
subscribe button down below I usually
put out 9 videos a week my schedule has
been crazy because of the United States
Thanksgiving holiday so my schedule is a
little bit off from what I normally do
but I do do five daily makeup minutes
which is makeup news and then typically
on Sundays I do a makeup new show full
length and then three other tip trick
