these are people you've never met were
going along with the whole family you've
never met theme um so this is this is
Amy this is Amy Amy's my sister-in-law
Sheena and she is my niece and they
bought this crazy contraption and I was
like oh can I like a video of you guys
drying it so that's why we're here is to
try this and it's called the air curler
as seen on TV and it's a revolutionary
new styling tool that creates luscious
curls in seconds okay so we're going to
see if we can make some luscious curls
on Sheena and we'll see whether it works
now Amy and I just fought for the past
like 40 minutes trying to put the say
together shall we figure in case you
want to buy this thing will show you how
we put it together Genevieve it's not
easy so Amy do you want to demonstrate
how we did this don't wait you did hey
you pick pick um thing wait wait wait
wait for homeless again first we put an
upside down right so that notches in
right then would you do you turn it
right see exactly exactly that's a
problem we've been having okay push it
all the way in and then you turn it and
then as you turn it you fit it into one
of the linen rajas you make it turn to
whichever side you want the curl to be
on okay whichever way you want the curl
the flip and then once you've got that
then you fit that piece on Becky's
pushes out a little bit and then this
piece is supposed to be attached to
attach the hair dryer if you if you need
to to make it fit better if this hair
dryer has an oval-shaped face like a run
for it highly so we're not sure how it's
going to work but we're going to do our
best so we're going to stick that in
here so we've got our contraption
and then we have to read the directions
start with a clean head of hair make
sure you Richard dry and here is damp
miss hair with water if you need to part
your hair in two equal sections starting
at the back of the head thank ya there
okay yes it is and then take two equals
that we already read that part starting
at the back of the head take a
horizontal pardon and clip the rest of
your hair up and out of the way we're
gonna skip that part plays a section of
hair into the bowl okay turn your hair
dryer on medium high medium heat setting
with high winds feet maybe the air
nozzles pointing away from your head and
position in the desired current
direction any hair comes out of the bowl
with lightly guide it with your hand to
stay inside the bowl do not let it come
out of the bottom hole you're not cover
the bottom with your hand let aunt let
hair slightly bounce against the walls
of the bowl as it spins in the vortex of
air keep it spinning for about 10 to 15
seconds and then do the cool air setting
this is very complicated cool air
setting for 10 to 20 seconds making it
like be shiny alright are you ready to
