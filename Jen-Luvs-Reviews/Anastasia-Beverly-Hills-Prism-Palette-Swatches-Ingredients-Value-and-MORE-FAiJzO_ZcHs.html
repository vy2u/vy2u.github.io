the Anasazi of Beverly Hills Prizm
eyeshadow palette as you may know I do
like to spend some good quality time
with a palette before I review it to
make sure I'm giving you the most
accurate thorough information possible
so today we're gonna be talking about
not just this palette but we're also
gonna be comparing it to the subculture
palette because I don't know about you
but when I first saw the prism palette I
was a little disappointed in the shade
selection because I just purchased the
the subculture palette and I saw a lot
of similarities so we're gonna do some
side-by-side swatches and talk about
formula and things like that so if that
sounds good to you hang tight we're
gonna get into it right now my palette
review videos are quite long they're
very thorough they give you lots of
information and everyone finds different
parts of my reviews valuable so there
will be skip ahead buttons down below in
the description you just need to click
on the time stamp and it'll take you
directly to the section that's labeled
down in the description so feel free to
use that I won't be insulted your time
is valuable please just feel free to
watch the sections of this video that
you find helpful we're gonna go ahead
and start off with what you get in this
eyeshadow palette so it is a black
packaging and it is a like velvety kind
of texture it's got this beautiful
design on the front I'm a huge fan of
the design on it I think it's gorgeous
I have to tell you though when I thought
of a prism I'm thinking rainbow you know
that's the first thing I thought it was
like oh my gosh this is gonna be so
amazing and then I opened I heard saut
open and I was like wow where's the
rainbow I mean I guess we've got a
little bit of rainbow in here but it was
not what I had expected based on the
name you do get 14 eyeshadows in here
anasazi Beverly Hills says that they are
a mix of ultra matte duo chrome and
metallic finishes you also get a double
sided brush the brush has a fluffy side
and a flat side I personally do not like
this brush at all I find the this side
to be very scratchy and then this side
is okay but it's definitely not my
favorite brush I have brushes that are
very very inexpensive from like Moda and
Real Techniques and things like that
that I love way better than that brush
one thing that's very interesting about
this one and the subculture is it does
say that there's a six-month shelf life
on this which is very very low compared
to most shadow palettes most a shadow
palette you'll get at least a year if
not two years of shelf life out of it
personally for me I usually use an
eyeshadow palette well past its shelf
life as long as it doesn't smell funny
as long as it doesn't seem like it's
changing in any way the colors aren't
changing in drastic ways or that you
know it's it's it's just the texture
it's just seems wrong I continue to use
them but a six-month shelf life is
pretty small and I once we get into
ingredients we'll talk about it a little
bit but there's no like preservative in
here like phenoxyethanol that is like
known to be a preservative there are per
things that can act like preservatives
as far as ingredients in here but
there's nothing in here that's like vel
preservative like he used to use a lot
of parabens and things until people stop
wanting to use parabens now they use
phenoxyethanol in most products but this
doesn't have either in it so that might
be the reason why it's only a six month
shelf life so you do choose to purchase
this make sure you keep an eye on it to
make sure it's not doing anything weird
that makes you think that it's gone bad
same thing with the subculture it's the
exact same thing if you want to purchase
this it is available at Sephora uLTA
Beauty lish Macy's Anasazi of Beverly
Hills website Dillard's and Beauty Bay a
little bit about honest Asya as a brand
if for some reason you're not familiar
they are a cruelty free brand but they
are not vegan there is one shade in here
called Osiris it's this one here this
one does have carmine in it carmine is
made from the juice of a bug it is a red
pigment so if that grosses you out you
want to stay away from Osiris but you
can know the rest of them have carmine
in them unlike the subculture palette
which said may or may not contain
carmine on quite a few of the shades the
palette and the eyeshadows themselves
are made in the United States but just
like I mentioned the brush was made in
China so now let's go into the value of
this palette it is a $42 eyeshadow
palette each pan is 0.7 grams which is
quite small I usually don't like to see
eyeshadow pans less than one gram per
pan you'll get up to 2 grams or more in
a pan in some palettes but this is just
0.7 grams so you don't get a lot of
product it is 9.8 grams total in the
palette leading us to four four dollars
and twenty-nine cents
per gram of product which is not a great
value compared to its pure brands like
urban decay and two-faced and tart and
things like that they usually hover
around the $3.00 mark a little less than
three dollar mark so 429 is very
expensive compared to those I totally
just noticed that my lipstick is like
bleeding really bad so I'm gonna fix
that hold on a second I'm wearing the
Pat McGrath lipstick in the shade three
and then I'm also wearing the Pat
McGrath clear vinyl gloss apparently
these don't go well together now we know
and it just goes to show that just cause
this a spensive doesn't mean that you're
gonna get something that works really
well together not that they were
marketed to be together but anyway now
we're off topic so let's go back into
the prison ballad oh my gosh totally off
top for a second but anyway so now let's
go a little bit into ingredients we're
gonna go ahead and compare the formulas
of the subculture and the prism palette
I'm gonna put up a chart now for you to
show you the formula comparison between
the prism and the subculture palette so
as you'll be able to notice the matte
formula is exactly the same in that they
are the exact same ingredients in the
exact same order so if you like the
subculture mattes it's the same formula
in the prism now with the shimmer shade
there's only one shade that has the same
formula and that's pyramid from the
prism palette and electric from the
subculture palette those are the same
formula the shades Osiris dimension
lucid eternal and Sphinx all have a
formula that seems to be unique to the
prism palette it's the same ingredients
they're just mixed up in different
orders so you can see there's about
eleven ingredients there that is
included in the prism palette but
they're mixed up in the different
shimmer shades that includes some not
others and they're in a different order
so that's considered a different formula
one thing I thought was really
interesting about the anasazi Beverly
Hills website is that there was a lot of
critique with the subculture as far as
it being a new formula and them not
telling anybody that was one of my
biggest critiques so they've now labeled
the different formulas the eyeshadows I
shadow palette so this one is consider
the full pigment formula the subculture
it says a full pigment and easy to blend
and then the modern Renaissance
it says highly pigmented and easy to
blend so it's a little bit different
there like I mentioned before there's
only one shading here and that's Osiris
that has the carmine in it all the
shades are tapped based they also
contain dimethicone so if you don't like
those ingredients for one reason or
another maybe you're sensitive to them
maybe you don't like them for whatever
your personal preferences are then you
definitely don't want to get this none
of them have mica mica is one that some
people either prefer or don't prefer for
one reason or another the shade pyramid
does have synthetic mica that's this one
here but there's no actual mica in the
palette so now we've gone over a
Nastasia as a brand we've compared the
palettes a little bit I want to
definitely get really deep into the
swatches I'm gonna show you swatches of
the entire prism palette with both
fingers swatch and brush swatch and my
friend Jenny is a medium skin tone I'm
going to be swatching it on her skin and
then we're gonna go ahead and show you
some of the shades that look kind of
similar in these palettes right next to
each other and then at the end I'm gonna
show you the shades that aren't really
similar that are pretty unique to each
individual palettes give you kind of an
idea of what you'll be missing out on if
you buy one or the other to kind of help
you make a better decision on which one
if either of these palettes you want so
let's go ahead and get into that right
now
all right here's the prism palette and
as you can see the outside of the
packaging does pick up a lot of dust and
dirt just so you know here are all of
the shades you can see there is a quite
a variety of shade range within this
palette we're gonna start off with lucid
Eden unity and Sphinx and as you can see
lucid doesn't really show up it doesn't
show up with a brush it doesn't show up
with a finger it doesn't show up partly
at all I was disappointed at how the
finger swatch showed up for Eden and
unity I do feel like these are stronger
amount colors and I don't feel like the
finger swatches do them justice I did
upgrade my brushes a bit because I
wanted to make sure I was giving you the
best swatch as possible so we're gonna
be using the mac 242 for the shimmer
shades and the Mac 239 for it the matte
shades but as you can see with Lucid
it's not showing up on the brush the
brush is just not picking up the shade
at all it just I haven't found a way to
work with it wet dry brush finger not
is working with this you can see that
eaton does pick up really well on this
brush and i feel like it brush swatches
pretty well it does build beyond this if
you want it to be even brighter unity
does brush swatch beautifully and i feel
like that's how it performs on the eye
sphynx finger swatches really well but
it brush swatches terribly i do feel
like you really need to use a finger for
sphinx rather than using a brush i've
had a lot of trouble getting it to pick
up on a brush even wet it's just not
working for me so this is the first set
of four altogether overall I feel like
lucid as a complete bust spanks is good
tapped on with a fingertip and even in
unity are nice matte colors especially
unity I really like unity if you're new
to my channel you're new to the white
test this is supposed to simulate a long
day of wear to see whether the shadows
will stain the skin temporarily and
it'll kind of help the shadows last
longer so you'll see Eden and the Sphinx
were the only ones that hung around
moving on to Osiris sphere obsidian and
dimension I actually do like some of
these shades I like half of them I like
sphere and I like dimension Osiris loses
all complexity that's in the pan when
you put it on the skin it the complexity
is gone it turns into kind of a gray
shade you can see here with the brush
swatch it's just thinking terrible
it's a horrible shade unless you just
want to use it for lightly smoking out
but don't expect to get that beautiful
dimension you get in the palette sphere
is a really fun shade it's very very
well made I do have trouble figuring out
how to use it within this palette but it
is a very well made matte neon color
obsidian is gonna give you more of a
smoky look rather than a matte black
I've tried this wet I've tried building
it up and you can build it up with lots
of work but don't expect it to build it
up without effort it is more gonna be
more of a smoky kind of color and then
dimension is gorgeous the finger swatch
is beautiful the brush swatch is a
little bit weak but you can apply the
shade with a brush it's a very nice
formula and I really do enjoy dimension
and with the white test this is actually
quite impressive you'll notice that
sphere really hangs on there which
surprised me because usually light
shades are the first ones to wipe away
so it's really impressed it's still
there they're actually all still there
to some level of City and of course
being a black lasts the longest or the
best and now moving on to parallel
pyramid throne and Saturn this I feel
like is the strongest set of four that
I'll be showing you in this palette
today parallel is just a beautiful matte
Brown it works great it does exactly
what it's supposed to do same thing with
Saturn yeah that brush swatch oh very
nice very nice and then pyramid is kind
of like the out some of the other
shimmer shades in this palette it really
is best applied with a finger tip and
even with that it does need some work in
my experience you can wet the brush but
I haven't had much luck with wetting the
brush either now throne is really really
nice I feel like throne is the superstar
of this palette I feel like it's got
beautiful dimension to it it does go on
with a brush I prefer it with a
fingertip but you can apply it with a
brush as long as you're willing to build
it up and Saturn is just a beautiful
matte orange shade favorite shades in
this set of 4 is definitely thrown and
then parallel and Satre and are just
really nice and that I could kind of do
without pyramid I just expect better
from honest Asya Beverly Hills you know
I just expect more it's not terrible
I've seen worse but from if it's honest
Asya I expect it to be really really
really good I would say throne is my
absolute favorite here even though the
brush swatch really isn't doing it
justice parallel and Saturn or wonderful
pyramid is okay it's definitely not up
to what I would expect from honest Asya
moving on to the last two we have
eternal and allure or lore however you
want to say it eternal I had very very
high hopes for but again we've got that
same kind of formula where it just
doesn't it doesn't build like I want a
shimmer shade to build lore on the other
hand is wonderful but eternal falls flat
again as far as the quality of the
shimmer shadow I just own so many
shimmer shadows there are such better
quality than this that it's just not
good enough for what I would expect
at the price point the Anastacio sells
at it's not a terrible shade it's not
the worst thing ever but I expect better
and then again with the white test
you'll see that the longevity of these
shadows will most likely be pretty good
now I wanted to do something a little
bit different up on top we have the
subculture paladin on the bottom we have
the prism palette I wanted to kind of
lay some of these shades next to each
other so you could see how they compare
shape that looks similar in the palettes
lucid and cube they're similar formulas
even though they're not the same formula
technically they both are terrible
make them really show up very well at
all I can't get them to work as Stoppers
they're just not good shades dawn and
unity are both equally as good they are
the same formula you can see that unity
is a little bit more yellow toned on as
a little peach year and now we're gonna
do a Dorne and then we're gonna do
Spinks and eternal because I wanted to
show you what a door and looked like
next to those two and you'll see the
quality of adorn is so much better than
Sphinx and eternal yeah I mean you just
you see that adorn is that really good
foiled formula and the other two from
the prison palette just aren't good
compared to that one and the shades will
you aren't that different and Sphinx and
eternal or in the same exact palette
there in the the prison palette so I
think that's kind of a waste of space in
the prison palette to have both of those
shades when they're so similar now we're
gonna move on to four more we're gonna
do mercury next to lore and both of
these are that same awesome matte
formula you can see they really aren't
dupes they're not even really that close
you could use them for similar purposes
what mercury is definitely deeper than
Laurel or has more of a pink tone we're
gonna see more similarities now here
with Roxy and Eden and Saturn now first
we have Roxy and you can see it's almost
the same shade as Eden Eden is just a
little bit more peach where rocks is a
little more orange then we're gonna pull
satin from the prison palette and you
can see that one's just a little more
red tone it is a little bit more opaque
than Eden but do they need to be in the
same palette in my opinion no now we're
going to do fudge and peril
those are the Matt Browns that are in
both the pallets and as you can see they
are very similar
now what I wanted to do is show you the
shades that I hadn't shown you yet so
we're gonna start off with the
subculture palette and the shades that
don't have anything even close to like
them in the in the prism palette so
these are the shades you'd be missing
out on like really missing out on if you
only bought the prism palette you can
see there are quite a few shades it is
very unique compared to the prism
palette
now moving on to the prison pallet I'm
going to show you less shades because
there are shades that can be almost
duped within the pallet like I showed
you just a minute ago so these the only
shades that really stand on their own as
being very unique to this pallet over
the subculture dimension and thrown are
definitely some of my favorite shades in
the palette so you may want to buy this
pallet just for dimension and throne but
I really don't feel like you're missing
out that much on Osiris or an obsidian
sphere is very very special to these
pallets but I don't know how wearable
that is for a lot of people and I'm
having some trouble figuring out how to
use it within this palette but that may
be one that would be a selling point for
a prism for you as well and finally
we're gonna show you my friend Jenny she
has medium skin tone and she is from the
Philippines so I want to show you the
swatches on her so first Lucid eat in
unity and sphynx I got her to do a
little twist for me this time and to
kind of show off those shimmers for you
and now the second set of 4 Osiris
sphere obsidian and dimension you can
see how lightly pigmented obsidian is
for a matte black again this is gonna be
a nice smoky color it's not gonna be a
solid black it's gonna take a little
work to get it to opaque matte black
Osiris really does lose the depth that
you see in the pan which makes me sad
but sphere and dimension both look
beautiful and then here's the next set
of four parallel pyramid throne and
satyr and these look gorgeous
on her skin tone
and then finally we have eternal and lor
and you can see even though lor isn't
that far away from her natural skin tone
you can really see it it's very very
nice
an eternal again a little bit weak but
you can definitely see that shimmer I
just wish it was a little more opaque
similar to the bronzy shade that's in
the the subculture palette you have seen
the swatches and heard some of my
opinions I'm gonna give you some more
opinions now with the demo of how I got
this look today I will tell you that I
am not 100% happy with this look but
I'll get into that as I'm doing the demo
for you to kind of tell you why I don't
like what was happening on my eyes there
are certain things I like certain things
I don't like I'm gonna stop babbling
just watch the demo I'll explain it then
all right you ready to get into this I
look I know I'm ready to show you so
this is the Mac Paint Pot in painterly I
did apply this to my eyes before I
started filming and we're gonna go ahead
and take the brush out because I don't
like that brush at all this shade is
Laura and this is the shade I'm going to
use up in macri's and I really like the
way this applies it applies very
smoothly and very easily no problems at
all with this shade taking me a little
while to think about what the world I
want to do with this palette I'm still
having some trouble figuring out how to
put these shades together into a look so
sometimes it takes me a little while but
we do come to a conclusion and we decide
to procrastinate and decide to just put
a little parallel in the outer corner
just to give myself a little bit of time
to think about what I want to do on my
lid so I'm just kind of putting that out
in the outer corner and now we're gonna
pop eat in in the center to outer corner
of the lid this again is a very very
nice matte shade and you can't see but
I'm dipping into unity and then I'm
gonna Pat that over the middle of my lid
kind of crossing over and into the inner
corner definitely not to me this
application effort but we're gonna fix
it we're gonna blend those shades right
into each other using a Luxy brush and
just using a clean fluffy brush to blend
that out and now I really want to show
you what Lucid looked like
over top of these matte shades I wanted
to show you what it looked like as a
topper and as you'll be able to see it
doesn't really work it doesn't really do
anything as a topper very very
disappointed in the way this shade looks
but I figured I would just kind of keep
going just so that you could see how it
worked
and the fact that it doesn't I don't
like that one at all but we're gonna
keep going and we're gonna move on and
we're gonna go into the shade pyramid
and the inner corner of the lid is kind
of mirroring what I had done with the
matte shade I just wanted to show you
how these worked and Billy isn't super
bright so I decided to show you with a
brush and there is no fix plus or
anything on this I just wanted to show
you what it looked like with the dry
brush and it does apply about the same
you do have to just build and build and
build with these shimmer shades is kind
of frustrating and then the outer corner
we're gonna take eternal and build that
up in the outer corner just to kind of
create that darker on the outside
lighter on the inside kind of look and
again we're gonna go and with the brush
on the one side of my face and my
fingertip on the other just so you can
see if there's a difference and really
what I find is you just have to build
and pack and build and pack and build
impact with a brush but you can get it
to build up to about the same as a
fingertip but these are probably some of
my least favorite foiled metallic you
kinds of shades I've seen recently
parallel just bringing that down on the
lower lash line you can see it's
completely in 100% effortless on the
lower lash line with this Moda brush and
then just kind of taking that fluffy
clean brush and blending just a little
bit more I'd brought that shade down a
little bit further past my lower lash
line just to deepen up that outer corner
a bit and now just going back into Laura
just to give something a little bit
lighter on the inner corner of the lower
lash and this is where I'm gonna leave
it because I don't want to make it worse
than it already is not a huge fan of
this look but I do want to show you the
way it looks with liner and lashes and
that is it I did feel like I wanted to
pair this with a bold lip because I felt
like my eye looking up quite boring
considering the foiled shades that I was
trying to use I thought these are
conservative oils but the metallic shade
I just has such better shadows than
these and and it's just very
disappointing but it's fine for a nice
lighter kind of shimmery look so you
haven't already gotten enough
information and now I'm gonna give you
my full review of these products some of
my opinions I've alluded to throughout
this video as far as how I feel about
this palette I'm not fan and the reason
why I'm personally not a fan is because
I'm a big shimmer lover I love shimmer
and shine and sparkle and all of that I
just feel like the duo crumbs and the
metallic finishes in here are just not
good compared to what else there is on
the market there they're just not good
they're so chunky and they're they don't
go on smooth this shade lucid is awful
it's it's really just I mean you saw in
the demo I tried to use it as a topper
it doesn't even work as a topper I've
used it with a brush of use of the
fingertip I mean I've used try to use
these multiple times in multiple ways
and they're just not good they're just
not good thrown I feel like is the
superstar of this eyeshadow palette but
my issue with thrown is I'm not gonna
wear this that often and if I am gonna
wear it it's gonna be as an accent color
I don't like super dark colors all over
my lid unless it's like Halloween or a
super special like night out where I'm
going for like really sexy smokey kind
of look would I ever wear shade like
throwing all over my lids which is what
I feel like that shade would be the most
beautiful is all over the lid now the
other side of it is the Matteson hero
really really good I do love the mattes
the mattes are creamy they're not patchy
they're they're not so easy to use
because they are really really pigmented
so you have to gently build them up kind
of like if you saw any of the subculture
videos there were people that were
swirling their brush together because
they didn't realize that it was a brand
new formula and they were having so much
trouble with the fallout and everything
you have to be very gentle with the mat
gently tap your brush and barely get any
product just kind of swirl your fluffy
brush in just very gently it'll pick up
plenty of product you just have to go
easy on it and just slowly build up the
product and if you do that the mattes
are wonderful and I think feel the same
way about subculture I feel like the
mattes are wonderful I do want to
specially talk about sphere because
sphere is a great shade it's beautiful
it does exactly what I would hope that
it would do being a matte neon yellow my
issue is is I don't know how to use it
and that's just me and my lack of
expertise
the only shades I can see to even use
this with would maybe be thrown in
Osiris I mean there's there I don't I
don't see why it's there it's like what
are you doing here sphere like what
where did you even come from and why are
you here like i i'd i wouldn't want to
hurt its feelings thankfully it's it
doesn't have feelings but it's it just
seems so incredibly out of place and
maybe they were just trying to make it
unique or something I don't know but or
maybe it might look good like with maybe
with Saturn with on a deep skin tone but
for me like I'm confused by it more than
anything if you've used sphere with
other shades in this palette I would
love to know what you use it with I mean
oh I guess you could use it with
obsidian that would be kind of cool to
do like a black and like a neon yellow
look but I'm not gonna wear that this is
not my style so you see what I'm saying
it's just it just doesn't fit what I
personally like Osiris I have an issue
with in that the undertones are very
black so you lose when you put this on
the eye you lose any complexity any
dimension that it had it's gone once it
hits the eye so I am NOT a fan of that
one at all I meant to mention that when
we were talking a minute ago about the
shimmers so overall this is not going to
be a recommend based on my personal
preferences but based on what you like
you may like it you just have to kind of
listen to what I've said as far as what
you like in a palette and then maybe
it'll work really well for you but it's
definitely not working for me I don't
like it I don't like it if I had to
choose between the two I would
definitely choose the subculture I feel
like the subculture is much more user
friendly in the shade selection I feel
like the quality of the shadows is much
better I do have a full review of the
subculture I can link that down below in
case you want to see my full thoughts on
this with full swatches of the whole
palette and everything but but yeah this
one's a big note for me I really didn't
like it it's it's not for me I am gonna
keep it because it is good for my
collection for swatches and dupes and
things like that but mmm nope they
missed the mark on that one for me I'm
really hoping that honest Asya keeps
being unique and she keeps trying to
come out with something
different but then also thinks about why
they're putting those things together
having some kind of like like I just
don't get this palette I don't get what
they were going for I don't I especially
having had the subculture come out right
before and them probably being designed
at the same time like I just don't get
like there's they're too similar you're
just too similar it's just I mean
they're not the same but they're similar
and I just don't get it I don't get it
some I think I've rambled enough
hopefully you get my point at this point
I'm going to turn the conversation over
to you my friend I would love to know if
you owned the prism palette what you
think of it what shades have you been
using together because I'm really
looking to expand my looks that I'm
creating with this and I'm having a hard
time figuring out you know how I want to
use this because it's just it's just a
weird palette
have you had better luck with the
shimmer shades if you have what kind of
brushes are you using are using your
fingertips are you using
fix+ what do you what are you doing to
make them work for you I would love to
know if you don't own this palette are
you planning on getting it and if you
are aren't why I would love to know and
