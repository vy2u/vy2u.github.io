the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to see whether they are worth
your hard earned money so today we're
gonna be testing out mr. smile patch by
Tony moly let me just preface this video
by saying I was looking at my magnify
mirror before I started filming this
video and I was like oMG I have a legit
mustache like I could see like hairs
here and I have never seen that before I
don't know if it's like a starting to
get older thing where you start to get
more hair on your face or what if you
know about this I need to know
information about the facial hair that
seems to be appearing on my face out of
nowhere and I wanted you to be able to
see whether this stuff works or not so I
spent about 15 minutes plucking the hair
all mustache and I don't know whether
this is my future should I have not have
plucked it should I be waxing it I need
help this is new territory so if you
know about mustache hair for women I
would love your thoughts about what I
should do about this in the comments
below but anyway we're gonna be playing
with this today I'm really excited to
see what the deal is with this this the
purpose of this is to reduce fine lines
in the smile area so you put this little
guy on and it is supposed to have
anti-aging benefits I got this for three
dollars and thirty nine cents on Amazon
but you can get this at peach and lily
for four dollars and fifty cents the
seller that I thought it from I don't
know why things go up and down in price
on Amazon they're no longer selling it
for that price they're now selling it
for five dollars and seventy cents you
only get one set of mustaches in here so
this is like a one-time treatment the
description on peach and lily says that
it is a hydrogel mask type that attacks
a laugh line creases with a potent but
gentle cocktail of ingredients so before
you use this you're supposed to wash
your face tone and play
on your laugh lines for 20 to 30 minutes
and then follow up with your regular
skin care regimen they do mention that
it is good for all skin types so I
looked at the ingredients for this and
we've got some good news and some
not-so-good news so the good news is is
that right after like the water and the
glycerin and all of that then we have a
ingredient called niacinamide which is a
really nice anti-aging anti-wrinkle
ingredient
after the niacinamide however is alcohol
which is not so good because it actually
will dry out the skin usually when a
company lists alcohol as an ingredient
it means denatured alcohol which is not
a good alcohol to have in your skincare
so the next one is we have a bunch of
flower extracts and then we have
hydrolyzed collagen there's mixed
details about whether collagen and skin
care actually seeps into the skin and
does what collagen does when it's
naturally in your skin so there's some
debate about that there's sodium higher
and eight which is good then this
phenoxyethanol which is a preservative
that is in almost every product that's
makeup related that some people are
sensitive to
there's also parabens in here there's
merritt methylparaben is the paraben
that's in here so if you don't like
parabens you will not want to purchase
this there's also fragrance in here so
if you do not like fragrance you don't
want to use this so along with good
things there's also bad things so it's
kind of like when you get food that is
has a lot of nutrients and good stuff in
it but it's also loaded with sugar or
extra fat you know lots of bad stuff too
so you know you got to kind of take it
for what it is good stuff and bad so at
this point we are going to try out these
patches but in order to do that I do
need to wash my face so I will be right
back alright believe it or not I am the
same person I feel like it looks so much
different without makeup on it's kind of
shocking
alright so let's go ahead and open this
baby up they open this thing oh there we
go so you just peel this off oh it's
very slimy in there oh I don't like
slime on my face why do I keep doing
this to myself like I didn't think it
was gonna be slimy before
for this although I do want to do a
close-up of my face you can see what it
looks like before so as you can see I do
have some fine lines right here but
they're very fine I'm definitely not the
wrinkly as person when it comes to my
smile line jet but I thought it would be
fun to try this anyway so let's just
slow it down John stop it and won't do a
close-up when it's over
they look like snails alright here we go
it's like slipping off my face
this goes look good it's like sliding
off I don't know how it's gonna stay on
for 20 minutes it's just it's very thick
maybe I can balance it on my face
oh there we go that one's sticking real
good all right uh-huh so I'm gonna leave
these on for 20 minutes you feel it stay
on and I'll be right back think of it
him to lay down all right so I let these
off for 20 minutes let's go ahead and do
a close-up of my mouth so you can see my
smile lines
honestly like I I don't think I have
enough wrinkles here for this to do
anything and I really don't think that
necessarily this was the best product
for me personally to review but I did
want to review it because it is a fun
product and I did want to go into the
ingredients and everything with it and
one thing I do want to note about this
that I don't like is that they do fall
off quite easily you stick them on and
you have to kind of keep your face like
this and then you can't talk or else
they fall off because if you move your
face down they fall off and of course
I'm making a liar out of me right now
there you go there they go off they also
rip relatively easily there's some
really good ingredients in them that
could make a lasting difference over
time most skincare doesn't do anything
in one 20 minute treatment like the only
thing that I know that makes a
difference for anti-aging in 20 minutes
is actual like Botox and things like
that they can make a difference but
skincare like this does in my opinion
and from my research take time to work
so to pay 350 or 450 or 550 for one
treatment is not going to be worth it if
it came as a six-pack for 550 then maybe
you know it might be fun to do if they
could somehow make them thinner so that
they stayed on better I think that would
be great then they could probably charge
less for them too because it will be
less substance I mean but all this is is
just glycerin I mean it's not even an
expensive thing I mean does have some
nice ingredients in there but they can
soak quite a few of those together you
know or put them in separate blister
packs or whatever I don't see any reason
for them to just be one set for that
price I think that it's overpriced for
what you get a sleepover the party
you're hanging out with the girlfriends
drinking glasses of wine and putting on
your mustaches and taking selfies and
stuff but they don't stay on long enough
in order to take those selfies so it's
like doesn't even have that purpose
which is kind of disappointing you know
because at Lieven
about it because you can't even like
leave them on long enough to laugh and
then if you left they do fall off so I
don't know I personally feel like this
is super gimmicky but there are some
good ingredients in it so I am gonna
give it two hearts just because of the
ingredients that I feel are really good
in it but as far as the value of it is
terrible that doesn't stay on that it's
overpriced for what you get I mean
you're not gonna see results for that
it's just super gimmicky so it's gonna
be my lowest rated product I've ever
shown on what the K and it has nothing
to do with whether it works personally
on me or not and the fact that I don't
think I have enough happening here for
its have made a difference but I did
want to give you information about it so
you can decide whether it's something
you want to try or not I personally
can't recommend it to you based on the
factors that I've just mentioned I want
to thank you so much for watching what
the K again this week I do have a
playlist that I am going to be linking

case if you like next week we are going
to be playing with the dong dong man
