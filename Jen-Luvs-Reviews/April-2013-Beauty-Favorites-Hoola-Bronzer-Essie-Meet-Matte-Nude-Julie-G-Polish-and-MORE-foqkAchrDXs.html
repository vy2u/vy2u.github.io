this slow must be frozen in the ice
hello my friends welcome to my April
favorites video okay so I'm going to
keep this short and sweet and I want to
include things that I have never talked
about in other videos because sometimes
I find myself kind of repeating myself
when I find things that I really really
like so I'm going to start off with
something that I don't talk about that
often but I have to show you our to nail
polishes that I am in love with right
now first one is by SC and it is called
Lyla scizzum which i think is quite
funny since my daughter's name is Lila
but I'm assuming that this has to do
with lilac being the color it is just
this gorgeous like purple minutes sese i
would i would buy an SE polish well over
an OPI polish and it's actually become
my favorite over china glaze china glaze
was my favorite and now um se is so yeah
I got enough se polishes to really be
able to test them out and love them the
other polishes by julieg and this is my
first julieg polish and i love this one
too this is a light pink I think these
have names but mine doesn't have a name
on it it says be to see on the bottom of
it it's a very light pink it is gorgeous
very chip resistant one coat and you
could probably with one but two looks
really really nice two coats of this it
has a very very faint shimmer to it but
it's definitely not noticeable until you
really really look at it with just a
gorgeous gorgeous light pink for spring
and this combo is just 0 to die for next
are two pallets that I have been loving
lately and the first one is the meet
Matt nude which came out not too long
ago but he said enough time ago that
it's been around you've probably seen it
but these are the shadows they're all
mad most of my eyeshadows that I owner
shimmering so this was new to me but on
the colors that i absolutely love are
the mat abdul which is like a topi brown
the mat wood has gotten a lot of love
which is like a dark dark brown I mean
give him at Garcia some
that doesn't sound very good but it's
true it's kind of a reddish tone brown
and then the Matt Johnson is like a grey
do those the ones that I like the most
the other palette that I got which I had
gotten for myself when I did the big
giveaway and congratulations to the
winners of the giveaway so excited for
them but yeah this is the two-phase
little black book of beauty and I
absolutely adore this it has 4 8 12
shadows in it and then it has two
blushes a highlighter and the bronzer
the one thing I love is the versatility
and the shadows you've got some bright
colors you've got nude colors got warm
you've got cool you've got all mostly
shimmers but a few really nice mats in
there bronzer is pretty light I'll
swatch that for you pretty light on the
bronzer not a big fan of that one for a
bronzer but it is kind of a nice cheek
color this one's kind of a quarterly
cheek color and then this one is more of
a rosy darker almost like a maulvi kind
of color and then the highlight is very
nice really really nice highlight also
hiding underneath this mirror is a lip
gloss with a thumbprint in it now it
does have a thumb print out but I don't
really use this a whole lot i'm not
really into the pan lip glosses that
much but um it is a nice lip gloss it's
nothing spectacular it looks just like
it does in there it's like a multi kind
of um color I mean it's nice but it's
definitely not the highlight of this
palette for me but I am really really
enjoying this if you happen to see this
on the Too Faced website especially on
sale definitely pick this up really
enjoying this next are my favorite
bronzers at the moment because I'm
really getting into bronzers now that
it's spring I'm like really just loving
my bronzers I got two new bronzers this
month I got hula by benefit that I've
been craving forever I have one of the
show battles like you know what today at
Ulta its twenty percent off and I by in
hula hula will be mine today and it was
so I do love hula hula is very nice but
if you are medium or dark skin tone this
may be too late for you make sure you
test it before you buy it because it
really isn't super super dark let me
show you it's like a chocolate brown
it's I would have mad
will be similar to the two-faced milk
chocolate Soleil definitely lighter than
the regular chocolate soleil bronzer but
yeah just a really nice subtle bronze
for my skin tone but again if you were
darker skin you probably won't want to
get this it probably won't be dark
enough for you the other bronzer that I
got was this Neutrogena Healthy Skin
blends um and this one is in Sunkist
number 30 and it had a little brush
there that I got rid of because it
didn't like it and let me show you what
that one looks likes watched the two
swatches just so you can see and as you
can see this one is kind of an orange e
a little bit um compared it's definitely
more coral I was very surprised by this
so I am not using this to contour it is
not doing well free for contour and I've
been wearing it underneath my blush just
to give my blush a little bit more
dimension and it is just gorgeous to do
that I'm wearing it today you probably
can't tell but I can tell it's one of
those things I can tell and I feel good
about it so I'm doing it but yeah really
really loving this as a cheek color not
for a contour ok the next thing I'm
going to tell you about is another thing
I don't ever talk about which is perfume
I got this beyonce pulse perfume and I
absolutely love this people say that it
smells like baby powder and I can kind
of see that but I don't think it smells
enough with baby powder that I wouldn't
um that it bothers me you know let me
smell it's definitely a fruity edge of
floral kind of scent i'll put the notes
right there so you can see what it's
what beyonce says it's supposed to smell
like butt but I it smells just very
light and fresh and springy to me and
I'm really enjoying this but while we're
talking about Miss Beyonce i want to
show you show you a perfume that i did
not like and it is this one this is the
beyonce pulse summer edition now these
are older perfumes i got these at
marshalls or somewhere where i saw them
on sale and that's the only time i will
ever buy perfume oh not going to spend
75 dollars on some liquid maybe this
doesn't smell good because it's old but
I'm telling you ladies this stuff smells
like straight rubbing alcohol if you if
you soaked fruit and flowers in rubbing
alcohol it would smell like the
they pull summer edition I would not
recommend this one and I got a huge
bottle of it I'm so bummed about that
and I wish I loved it and I just don't
the other one I wanted to show you that
I am in love with is this midnight
fantasy by britney spears this is a
really nice night time going into the
evening going out sent it's a very berry
smell to me like mixed berries but um
but yeah really really enjoying the
scent a lot the last product I wanted to
show you i actually got in my beauty box
5 and this is the h2o see dried skin
care I guess h2o plus aqua firm with
marine microspheres where do they come
up with this I just don't get it I lift
concentrate and I'm telling you I think
it's working I really do I really think
this is working I was mad at first
because I squeezed half the tube up at a
no product was coming out but then I
realized how little you really need to
use in order to get it to work I feel
like I had let these dark um like
creases like indents right here on my
eyes like my eye sockets my husband's
like that's just your eye sockets your
eyes are supposed to do that but I don't
believe him um but I think it's
tightening it's definitely tightening
here I definitely still see my fine
lines it's not totally making them
disappear but I really feel like there's
some tightening going on which I have
never never seen from any I product even
my origins one that I have did not help
at all for my under eye area so I'm
really excited about this so I went to
marshalls and I found this one this one
is the same brand but this is an aid I
defense for defying serum so I'm hoping
these two are at least similar cuz I
thought I got this one when I bought
this one and it wasn't the same bangs so
I'm hoping please be the same so I'm
gonna use all this up I'm gonna give
myself a few days to detox off of it
like to make sure this is all out of my
skin system and then I'm going to try
this and see how it works so i will let
you know the last thing I wanted to show
you is another thing I never talk about
is an iphone app and i don't know if
they make this for other android droid
phones whatever they call them it is an
iphone app called coupon Sherpa and i
know that's the weirdest name ever but
this thing is
so amazing though there he is next to my
group home and I'm gonna click him so
you see all the cute he's like going up
into the mountains is little Sherpa dude
come on coupon Sherpa he never moves
this slow must be frozen in the ice
hello I'm gonna show me my coupons or
what my Sherpa died you're not allowed
to say son of a channel oh there it is
see I said John just had to use a curse
word and now it's there so it's got a
list of all different stores I mean it
stores from all over the country all
over the United States so you've got
these little stars you can see my
favorite stores that got AC moore and
taylor babies r us but in a republic
books-a-million build a bear so I'm in
the middle of limited and I want to buy
something so I look and I see oh it's
got there's a coupon so I I touch it and
there's my coupon and then all I have to
do is show this to the person usually
they'll take them right off my phone I
decide to show this to the cashier and I
got my money off and I didn't have to
print anything I'd have to think about
anything I have to wait for an email and
sign up for all this junk it's just all
mr. Sherpa keeps them all for me I went
to Party City when my daughter I got
birthday party stuff the other day and I
had like seventy dollar seventy-five
dollars for the stuff but if I spent
eighty dollars I got thirty dollars off
so I did that and I ended up spending 08
nose twenty dollars off eight hours
spent twenty dollars about twenty
dollars off so my ended up spending $65
485 dollars worth of stuff just because
of mr. coupon Sherpa so those are my
favorites for this month and have a lot
of fails just a lot of really good stuff
this month that I'm really happy about
mad love I hope you had a great April
and I will see you in May yeah well see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
