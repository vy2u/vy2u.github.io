failed time it's time to talk about my
favorites and fails and there are
constant Plains going by wash I just
finished filming what's up in makeup
it's Friday in my time and there were
literally planes and I mean literally in
the literal sense of literally every two
minutes planes going over my house I had
to stop constantly it was so frustrating
but now I need to bring myself to my
happy place
and my happy place it's my favorite sin
fails video it is my favorite video to
film every single month I'm so excited
to share my favorites and fails with you
this one but before I do I want to show
you something because this is a
partnership but not a sponsorship this
is just a favor I'm doing for a friend
of a friend and I want to show you it's
a brand called roll up and die dy e it
is a tie-dye company that's local to me

things she can do they're really really
cool like for example they have these
really cute shirts this is the one that
she made for my son isn't that adorable

watches them in small batches all the
prints are handmade I mean isn't that
absolutely adorable like my son he sawed

the pants that she made for my daughter

she puts a little roll up and dye logo
on the back and then she makes QT little
onesies they're so cute here's another
one they're just so adorable oh my gosh
and then she also makes these really
neat scarves she was wearing one when

you have a mom in your life that enjoys
tie-dye prints or if you're just looking
for something cool and different and
unique and handmade by a small business
again links down below so now onto the
makeup and beauty stuff we're gonna
start with the worst product I tried
this month going all the way up to the
best starting with number 10 now this is
a product that was sent to me in pure
I've been using this before I started on
the halo Beauty vitamins I've been using
this I don't know a really really really
long time I feel like at least since
like Christmas time I've been using this
this is the Marc Anthony strengthening
grow long rapid grow leave-in spray
stuff let me show you how the sprayer
works I love the sprayer that's my
favorite thing about this is this little
gun sprayer is super cool now what it's
it says it's a strengthening row long
rapid grow leave-in that's the part that
I why this is number 10 that did not
happen
there was no rapid growth there was
nothing happening there but it did do
some of the other things so for example
it adding shine it definitely adds shine
I really like that about it I can't
really talk about the detangling
properties because my hair doesn't
really get that tangled since it's so
thin but I can't write and as far as
breakage in split ends I didn't notice
anything in particular but I really
wasn't paying attention to that the big
thing I was paying attention to was the
the lengthening you know to make my hair
grow longer and stronger and everything
that just didn't happen so that's why
it's at number 10 it's I guess it's not
a bad product if you're just looking for
shine it just didn't do what I thought
it was advertised to do I recently
showed this in my IMATS haul and I even
though I haven't had this for that long
I still feel very confident putting this
at number 9 this is a sigma brush tower
and it was funny because I showed this
in
in the live chat and people were like
yeah that thing sucks like oh well there
you go why didn't you tell me while I
was at I met I had never asked I have
been terrible at washing brushes and
it's something to motivate me to wash
brushes so I purchased this to try to
kind of help me do that and the first
thing I got first thing I did when I got
home but pretty soon after I got home I
got into washing my massive brush
collection and every single brush was
dirty so this is my thing let me get let
me get brush and show you so let's say
I've got a large brush like this and
what these things down here are supposed
to do is they're supposed to be for
shaping but the problem is is that these
bands are not very big so when I'm
washing brushes I don't want to spend
forever fiddling with something it's a
long tedious process so I want things to
go quickly and easily and I and number
one you have to pick this up in order to
put the brushes in the thing and then
you've got a wiggle them all in here and
then you've got to figure out how you're
gonna smash them in here and you got to
shape this around it's like and then it
comes out okay so let's try that again
and imagine trying to do this when it's
full of other brushes you can't they'll
all fall out
so this is supposed to go the wet brush
is supposed to go inside there and then
you're supposed to snap this in place
like that okay and that's just too much
work for me when I'm washing my brushes
it's too much it's not functional so I
ended up kind of abandoning these little
wrap things here and just kind of
started pressing them in now I do
appreciate that there are many different
sizes both in the eye brushes and the
face brushes I like that I also like
that it was very easy to assemble what I
didn't like is as I was putting brushes
into one side the other side started to
fall out and then I'm getting frustrated
because like I said I want brush
cleaning to be something that I can just
run through the brushes my biggest work
should be actually cleaning the brushes
not putting them on the stand I am gonna
keep it and I am gonna still use it but
I don't like it it will probably be
replaced eventually next is the product
that I had very low expectations for
very low expectations I swatch this
thing and I was like oh no this thing's
gonna be terrible this is the boxycharm
and pure collet that came in boxycharm
and I used this three or four times and
it wasn't as bad as I thought it was
going to be I definitely don't think
it's worth the price point at all not
even close to worth a price point but it
wasn't as bad as I thought it's gonna be
in that the lasting power lasted me a
good solid eight hours with primer I was
expecting six with the way that these
things swatched it was awful but like
you know like I know like you know
swatches aren't everything the the
texture on your fingers isn't everything
and though this is definitely not my
favorite pal to you it doesn't bring me
joy I don't have fun using it it's not
awful it's fine so I will probably pass
this on just because I feel like a
pallet really needs to make me be happy
to use it and this just doesn't it
doesn't bring me joy so I'm gonna pass
this along to a friend that doesn't mind
that I've dipped into most of the
shadows in here number seven are
products that I actually really really
like but there's a big huge giant butt
in this thing here these are the nude
Stix pencils and I have raved about
these so much so much and I'm sorry I
like to update you on things and these
are going down
in my rave they're very opaque they're
very creamy they're very hydrating but
after a while they start to ball up on
my lips especially if I've eaten
anything kind of like a liquid lipstick
can sometimes when I have a creamy lip
product I expect I not expect but I hope
that it will wear down gracefully these
do not do that they well in a way they
do if you can somehow get them to stop
crumbling then they're they they're fine
like they leave a nice color it's just
the the obnoxious crumble pieces and the
shades are beautiful but I don't know I
mean it's just it that's why they're
kind of in the middle I don't dislike
them but I don't love them because of
that crumble factor it just and I just
wish that they didn't crumble if they
didn't crumble they'll be perfect
next is a product that I really really
really like a lot but it's starting to
fail on me some this is the house of
lashes lash glue I got this when I went
to the glam masters premiere and well as
the premiere party in New York City and
I stopped by Ricky's NYC and I asked
them if this stuff was legit and they
were like yeah it definitely it's
amazing and I stood there in the Ricky's
and I've got the lash glue on my on my
lashes and I'm trying to put them back
on because they were kind of flopping a
little bit and I'm not going to the glam
masters tamir with wonky lashes bad
terrible idea so I put this on my lashes
stayed on all night even through the
train ride home at midnight I still had
my lashes on they looked great so so
excited I got at home I tried it and I
realized that this is not good at least
for me from my experience on lash bands
that are very very thin you know those
plastic wiry ones it does not work on
those but the thick lash bands like the
one I'm wearing today the ones that have
like a little bit of substance to them
it works fantastic so I just have to be
careful wish which lashes I use this
with but that is why it is in the middle
and not at the top because the lashes
that it does hold on it holds on very
very well number five is a product that
I did do a full review on this is the
bad gal bang by benefit again I got it
at that glam masters premiere it's a
good mascara is it a great mask
no but it's good it makes my lashes a
little bit longer it does give them a
little bit of volume but it does clot my
lashes together a little bit it gives it
kind of that not spider lash full out
but inching on Speyer lash and the way I
get rid of that is by doing the little
brush wiggle and that helps some but
they still do clump together
unfortunately lasting power on this is
really good for me I don't find that it
flakes your smudges on me but I don't
typically have smudging problems with
any mascara I want to make sure I say
that and the flaking thing it does
happen sometimes but not super often but
yeah so this is just an okay mascara for
the price I would definitely say it's Oh
No if this were a drugstore price
mascara then I would say yeah great
because it would last through like a
most of a school work day without you
know giving me too much trouble but
because of the price point I expected to
do better I expect to see more volume I
expect to see even more length but it
was fine it was just kind of fine now
we're getting into all the really good
things okay so please don't take this as
you know this is just my least favorite
of my favorites because the rest are all
really good so this is the amrezy
highlighter by Anastasia and I do really
really like this it gives your cheeks
kind of like a wet look instead of like
the way my lip my cheeks look right now
I'm wearing the pop looks the the black
highlighter and that this one gives you
like that boy oh man your face kind of
glow where this is more of like just
like a wet sheen and I think that's
really nice and it's different than a
lot of things I own like I think I was
thinking expect me to be more like an
Oprah highlighter like really pop in and
crazy but it wasn't like that and I
thought it was nice and soft and pretty
it's still glowing don't get me wrong
but it's different and that's why I
really like this lasting power on me was
really good not great but really good
definitely lasted most of the day and I
could still see it still see a a sheen
of it just a tiny bit at the end of the
day but not full on like I just applied
it like my Oprah's so overall this is a
recommend I think that it's really good
for
the right person is looking for that
kind of highlighter number three is
another product that's really really
good that I love this is the flower
setting powder by beauty bakery and this
has been out for a while let me go get
the packaging for you because it's so
cute I saved it just to show you and
then I'm gonna throw it away hold on oh
my gosh you got to see this look how
this comes it comes in a little flower
bag and it's even got nutrition facts on
the side I am Telling You like Beauty
bakery I feel like they have some of the
best packaging in the entire makeup
market so they've got nutrition facts
that says I'm one sweet sweetie per
serving the 100% vegan zero percent
calories zero percent gluten 0% parabens
like what yes mattifying yes and then
it's got the ingredients down here which
I thought was really cool and then it's
got baking tips over on this side I mean
seriously seriously it's so cute but
what's more important is how does it
perform it performs very very well it's
very finely milled and it comes with let
me show you the top of it tops very
important it's got the sifter inside and
I do find the product does kind of
jumble around in there unless I
specifically take the time to close it
which usually I forget but I do kind of
like that because when I bring my brush
over I don't want to have to fight with
the powder to get it out and I don't
have to fight with the powder to get it
out the packaging is good and this is
very solid on there it's easy enough to
turn for me but if you have any kind of
pinching problems where your hands may
be that might not be able to pinch
things you may have trouble spinning
this just so you know because it is kind
of tight but the performance of it is so
good it gives my face kind of reminds me
of the two-faced powder that it gives me
like a nice soft finish without it being
you know powdery looking without it
being too matte and it's definitely a
luminous in any way but it's got like
this nice finish and I definitely feel
like it makes my my makeup stay on
longer
it's really beautiful powder I like it
just as much as my other favorites I
have so many favorites of powder at this
point they all kind of tie and this gets
to go in with all of my favorites oh
yeah big huge win on this I really
really enjoy it a lot just like my last
product was set in PR my second favorite
product is always also
centi are from the exact same brand
these are the mark-anthony they're brand
new these are the volume cocktail
whether it's the cocktail line these
things are so cool I showed them in and
I think it was a an Instagram story I
think I showed these these things are so
neat the first thing that caught me was
the marketing of them let me show you I
actually have three of them they said I
think there's four of them in the line I
have not tried the beach waves cocktail
the texture and volume one but this one
the volume one because you know I hate
the volume of my natural hair I am
wearing extensions today but my my
natural hair has zero volume so the way
that this works is you've got two
different products in here and you've
got two different sides to the cap so
what you can do the idea is is you can
squeeze them out together or you can do
one at a time and you make your own
cocktail of hair product I just think
that's so smart so the first one here is
the root lift souffle so what I do when
I get out of the shower is I just
massage that into my roots and then I
put the volumizing cream I put that all
over the bottom and work it up into the
top and it works I'm telling you it is
beautiful the way that it works actually
let me take out my extension you know
God can't stop talking about this halo
hair extension let me pull this out I'm
gonna pull it out for the rest of the
video because it's painted you know a
pain in the butt to put back in but it's
you know it's not the easiest thing to
pull put back in if you saw me without
volumizing product you would be able to
tell like the limp flatness of my hair I
feel like it does give me a significant
volume and I do really like it a lot I
also really love the smoothing cocktail
this is the smoothing cream and the
glossing lotion and I find that the
smoothing cream is really nice actually
I'm wearing it a little bit in my hair
today because I was having a lot of
flyaways it holds down my flyaways
without giving me a crunchy feel it's
got a little bit like when you first put
it in a first dries it can feel a little
bit textured but it's not bad it doesn't
feel like hairspray or anything and it's
just really nice and also the glossing
lotion does give the hair or really nice
shine my only complaint about these
products is that the more you use them
it becomes a lot more difficult to
squeeze the product out both at the same
time because they're filled at different
they have different amounts of space in
them so you can't really do
anymore so I definitely recommend as you
go just opening up one side adding the
other separately if you want to instead
of trying to do both at the same time
because it is a little bit frustrating
but that's really just kind of a nitpick
about the packaging itself and it it
really doesn't matter the performance of
the product is what matters and it
really does work for me it works great
and the last product I was not expecting
this and I think that's the majority of
my number ones in these countdowns is
something that I'm not expecting and
this is something I wasn't expecting I
got that I've said this a bunch of times
and I know I've said the video is coming
I'm hoping it'll be next week that's the
plan
the giant covergirl box and this was the
biggest surprise to me in the box
there's good things in the box there's
kind of bad things in the box and
there's some really bad things in the
Box we'll get to that in full review but
this was the best this is the covergirl
lid lock up I'm not even kidding this is
what happened I put the urban decay on
one side I'll put the covergirl on the
other side I wore color pop eyeshadows
my eyes looked exactly the same you
couldn't tell which one was Urban Decay
you couldn't tell which one was the
covergirl it was in saying I could not
believe it
I was shocked absolutely shocked I also
used with their eyeshadows same thing
Urban Decay versus this because you know
Urban Decay is my Holy Grail eyeshadow
primer same thing totally held up with
the cover by shadows that they sent now
without this and the covergirl
eyeshadows it's going really really fast
but with this I feel like those
covergirl shadows it's essential to have
a primer if not this primer with those
shadows because they fade super fast but
just it just totally caught me by
surprise I would not be surprised if
this is another one of those primers if
they keep it in the market that because
sometimes brands get rid of things that
are amazing but if they don't I would
imagine this is going to be another
Milani eyeshadow primer that everybody
talks about I think this is going to
rival that to be completely honest with
you it is really really good if you've
tried this definitely please let me know
your experience with it I do want to
make sure you know I do not dry lids I
do not have oil II lids I have normal
lids with a little bit of texture so it
may
not work for oily lids it may not work
for dry lids from my lids it was
fantastic
