blog we are so excited to go to the I
mats I don't look like I'm going to the
I mats with my dark circles but there's
no point putting makeup on now because
I'm gonna get all gussied up later we're
gonna go out to dinner later and go hang
out and have fun we're not meeting up
with anybody tonight though we don't
have any plans we're just going to hang
out with each other have a good time
kids or their grandparents house and
they're excited to go over there and
spend the night for a couple of nights I
came home and found my birchbox so I'm
gonna open it real quick and just do a
little unboxing just gonna throw my
stuff everywhere there's a carton it's
got lots of pretty flowers on it I got a
temp laughs I got a temple spa peace be
still calling face and body balm I'm not
sure about that see if I can open it
one-handed I can't that's okay moving
out oh oh good a dad now that I'm not
gonna die Oh with shave cream last time
I got one of these it was pink and I
didn't like it at all it just work at
all so I'm not excited about that all
right and this is the protector
what is this protect oil keeps hair
healthy and shiny be protector stuff is
overall pretty awesome so I'm happy to
have that and then I got my pillow pack
this is true unboxing haven't done a
birch box unboxing in a wild I got box
Birchbox I know we hunt is now I know we
haven't on the Smackdown at like three
search boxes
and this is the third one for me I cream
with this teeny tiny baby sample it's a
super good eye cream but you don't need
a lot of eye cream in order to test and
eye cream so that's pretty cool going
over a bridge are we going we're going
to be going over the big bridge in a
minute are you little bridge oh we won't
be the tunnel yeah okay and then this is
simply cynthia rowley brightening
illuminator what is that I brought
actually brought Cynthia Rowley eyeliner
the silver one with me because i love
that eyeliner okay so one little pop on
the lower lash line this is tiny again
tiny tiny and it looks like it's just
the highlighter say oh it's closed this
is not meant for one-handed unboxing
that's okay but will do will do the
smack down eventually and I'll tell you
what I thought of all this stuff but I
sorry I'm like jumping you up because
going over these bumps but yeah I just
wanted to say hi show you what I got on
my birchbox and tell you we're on our
way to I'm at we're going into New York
City one up no yolk today so excited
we're about 40 about 35 minutes from our
destination to our hotel but i just want
to show you this because it's really
pretty even though it's overcast it's
still cool to see all the buildings like
this right we're about to go into the
holland tunnel up we're stuck at a light
up worse yep this guy's been a trouper
drove the whole way cuz he's awesome
like that my back hurts yeah bet tattoo
for like 12 hours yesterday punch it out
like rocky punch it out like Rocky our
hotel is awesome but the fitness center
sucks I just thought you might want to
do that
yeah he's very bummed about that he's
green $14 toll just to go through that
tunnel yeah that's kind of expensive but
I guess you know New York City's gotta
pay for stuff it's a busy city they
gotta pay for their roads even though
there's potholes all in them you think
that that New York City paying fourteen
dollars in tolls you'd be able to fix
the potholes in the road I'm just saying
that's just you know I'm just saying
we're going under the water oh here we
go here we go here we go Oh
tunnels freak me out am I ever see them
what's that movie daylight with uh
what's his name what's that guy's name
it's in daylight I forget what his name
is with a rocky guy he's like if this is
a rocky guy I'm the guy who plays rocky
so lone it's got Stallone in it yeah I'm
pretty sure it's Stallone anyway they
get stuck in the tunnel and like some
dude gets electrocuted and like oh it's
terrible so now I'm terrified of tunnels
because I saw that movie because my
mother made me watch it one because I
guess she thought I could handle it and
I could not handle that movie and now
I'm terrified of tunnels see we're like
going down onto the water and I'm
freaking out I'm freaking out man I
don't like it oh all right we made it to
our hotel it's called what is it called
ink48 flash to 20 minutes later we're
ready to go out on the site is show you
