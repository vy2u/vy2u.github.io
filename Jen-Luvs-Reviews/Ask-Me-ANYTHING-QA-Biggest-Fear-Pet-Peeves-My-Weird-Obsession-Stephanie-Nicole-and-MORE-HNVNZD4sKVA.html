me anything video a couple weeks ago in
my live chat I did say if you had any
questions for me for it might ask me
anything you can go ahead and leave
those down in the comments below I
compiled all the questions and I'm gonna
be answering a lot of them for you today
and I'm gonna be adding some other fun
facts in there for you that are just
really weird things about me I'm a very
odd person and I don't feel like I get
to show that side of me to you so I'm
excited to share that with you right
about now before I get into the
audience-participation questions I did
want to like just tell you some weird
things about me because I have gotten a
lot of new subscribers thanks to
Stephanie Nicole from doing the
collaboration with her why did I just do
that to my hair by the way I have set up
the next two collaborations and I think
you're gonna be super excited once I get
to them there's gonna be one and I
haven't set the date completely yet
January for every March is gonna be one
and then April May June will be another
one the July August September one I've
got my thoughts on who I want to ask but
I want to at least wait until I'm done
with the January for every March one
before I ask that person so good but you
guys are gonna freak out you guys gonna
love the next couple clouds they're
gonna be amazing
I wanted to tell you some some weird
random facts about me because I've
gotten some comments lately about you
know that I have this newscaster voice
and that I'm unrelatable and you know I
can't help my voice first of all like
this is this is my voice and it's so
funny but because before the past year
no one in my entire life has ever told
me I had a newscaster voice like maybe
it's because I'm getting older maybe
like my intonation is changing maybe
it's just you know doing what's up and
makeup is seeped into my life I don't
know but no one has ever told me that
before this past year it's so weird but
anyway let me just tell you a couple
things so the first thing that is very
embarrassing is I have an intense fear
fear of zombies and I have a story to
share with you well a couple stories so
one was that my students one year ago I
used to be a teacher if you don't know
that I'll talk to you about that in a
little bit but my students found out
that I had a fear of zombies and they
started walking around like this and
making faces and I actually like felt
anxiety building up me and these are
these are unmasked UNMIK de made-up
children that I knew on a personal level
and I still was feeling
okay you guys really have to stop the
other zombie story I have to tell you
was one that's really embarrassing that
we went to a theme park for Halloween
not this past year the year it was a
year before we were there with people
from my husband's tattoo studio and my
kids were there and everything and
they're like we have to leave by 6:00
because the zombies come out at 6:00 and
mommy's gonna be too scared to stay but
six o'clock started coming and everybody
was having fun and I didn't want to be
the party pooper and say okay we have to
leave so I was like okay I'll be fine so
me and my friend Meredith who works at
the shop you know we're linking arms and
like I'm like thinking about this and
I'm like getting choked up thinking
about because it still freaks me out a
little bit so there's a stage and
they're this like Jen you do makeup
videos it's just teenagers in makeup you
do realize that right I'm like yes I
know it's just teenagers in makeup and I
started crying because I was so
terrified that there were these zombies
gonna come out and I knew they weren't
real but I actually and I was laughing
because I know it's stupid it was that I
was crying I mean it's not I'm really
stupid I know that's not really a nice
word to say about myself but you know it
just it made me I was so terrified once
we started walking around one of the
zombies came up to my son screamed in
his face my six-year-old went up
screamed in his face and my son laughed
and if somebody had done that to me I
would have been crying for 15 minutes
it's this crazy thing so no Walking Dead
for me I watched Shaun of the Dead I had
nightmares for a month
Shaun of the Dead not Dawn of the Dead
Shaun of the Dead the comedy one so
anyway that's enough about zombies I'm
done with that subject a little bit more
calming I'm addicted to ASMR videos I
have to listen to them when I go to
sleep or else I can't go to sleep I've
always had sleep issues like getting
myself to calm down and go to sleep so
ASMR if you don't know is like autosomal
Meridian response something or another
but it's videos and the ones that I like
are the ones that are like the soft
speaking so like people like holding
crystals up and pretending to do like
Reiki healings and people you know
pretending to brush my hair and you know
it's really weird like if you you drop
yourself into an ASMR video you're gonna
wonder where in the world you you where
where did I end up what corner of
YouTube is this my husband hates them I
have to wear headphones he can't stand
them the eBay they freak him out I
can't stand like the chewing ones I
don't like to hear mouth sounds they
grossed me out since I hear a mouth
sound I have to like click out but I
love like the wishy swishy kinds of
sounds they helped me to sleep so I'm so
addicted to ask some more videos and
it's funny because I've had people say
in the comments when I do my voiceovers
that I have a good ASMR voice when I do
and now we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna swatch the shade okay biggest pet
peeves are pee on a public toilet seat
and peeing on the toilet see in my house
and my six-year-old decides he's not
going to be careful and also when people
leave grocery carts in the middle of the
parking lot if there's ever a grocery
cart in the parking lot I have a thing
that I have to go put it away I can't
leave it in the parking lot I don't care
if it's you know ten below zero and the
part in the carts way over there I will
go get that card and I will put it away
because it bothers me that much I'm so
worried it's gonna smash into somebody's
car and dent their car I feel like
that's just so inconsiderate I don't
know it really bothers me
the last personal weird thing about me
is that I don't like odd numbers and I
don't especially don't like prime
numbers prime numbers just like if my
radio you know it's got like a number on
it if my radio turns especially the 13 I
can't leave it there I can't I have to
turn it to 14 like oh it has to go to 12
one or the other
I can handle 15 the multiples of five
don't bother me so much but like I
prefer to put my radio on even numbers
anytime I have anything like where it's
got a number I have to put on an even
number I don't know what it is if it
doesn't end up on an even number like I
don't have obsessive compulsive where
like it causes me severe anxiety or
anything it just bothers me it just bugs
me you know and eventually I forgot
about it it's not super severe but I
don't like numbers that aren't even I
know I told you I'm weird I told you
okay so now we're gonna go into the
questions that were actually asked those
are ones things I just wanted to share
with you the first one is from Gigi
Frisby who comments on all my videos I
love her comments she says question I'm
all about anything dog related and saw
your pup on Twitter and one of your
delightful family photos can you
introduce him or her on camera I've
never even heard his or her bark Sam
doesn't bark a whole lot Sam is a
Brittany he's kind of sort of spaniel
ish but they're not considered spaniels
but that's the closest thing that I can
say that he is
got him from a breeder not from a puppy
store he is the sweetest sweetest
sweetest dog ever he is just so kind and
and loving and amazing and the only time
he barks is when someone comes to the
door but if that person is invited and
he quickly stops barking let me go get
him I'll get him I'll see if I can get
him to come on camera okay let's see if
I can get him on camera come on baby
there you are there he is oh he's so big
and heavy there he is
okay so this is Sam and he's amazing
he's so sweet and I love him so much and
he's such a good boy see I see him weird
weird Paul see how he doesn't even care
that I'm holding him at this awkward
angle doesn't even care he's kicking the
microphone like mommy what are you doing
to me but yeah he's a good boy and I
love him so much and you so sweet me
such a good family dog all right I'm
gonna let you go so you'll have to keep
sitting at this awkward animal buddy all
right there you go
I do also have two cats I have Brooklyn
who is the younger cat he is an orange
cat and he's kind of a Butthead he's
okay though he's cool he likes to cuddle
at night but he can kind of like he
likes to hunt the kids and mess with
them and like hide behind things and
then kind of reach out and try to grab
their feet and stuff like that where
star is kind of skittish she's a black
cat she's very skittish and shy and
doesn't really come out a whole lot
she's she's a sweetheart though she's my
baby next up from Sarah Webb what are
three makeup products you cannot live
without I don't really have any makeup
products I can't live without I pretty
much can live without makeup completely
but as far as in general I love my black
pen eyeliners right now my obsession is
the NYX epic ink but I also love the Kat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper to steal
the one I like but not quite as much as
the Kat Von D 1 L soul of the Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner is also you know
equally as good the em cosmetics pen
liner is really good those are all great
I love eyeshadow eyeshadow is
kind of my thing but I don't have an
eyeshadow palette that I couldn't live
without because I just exchange it for
another one that I love a lot a favorite
formulas for eyeshadow my favorites are
Juvia splays color drain and lorac oh
and Kat Von D I would say are my
favorites I know I don't talk about
lorac a lot on the channel and like lip
balms I have to have some kind of lip
balm but I'm not like picky about which
lip balm it is because I don't ever have
any lip balm that does everything I want
it to do as far as like really healing
my lips and making my lips always
awesome like nothing ever completely
does that for me but I do love lip balms
I'm a big lip bone fan Sarah also wants
to know if I ever thought about doing
fashion vids no I've never been thought
about doing fashion videos to me I don't
find myself to be extremely fashionable
so no I'm not that good at that stuff
it's not my it's not my thing I would
love to see you do some high school
story times every year in high school
for me was different
it was a different story completely you
know ninth grade I was kind of alone I
didn't really have a lot of friends in
ninth grade tenth grade I hung out with
a bunch of 11th graders because I had a
boyfriend that was in 11th grade and you
know that was kind of an odd year
because my life was kind of centered
around him and his friends and my best
friend at the time who was dating his
best friend and we were kind of like a
quad but his best friend didn't like me
which was very awkward and weird because
he was dating my best friend I don't
know it was just weird
and then 11th grade was the year that I
was really into a Christian youth group
but that is a whole another story that
was not a good Christian youth group
there are good Christian youth groups
out there that was not one of them so
that was another story and then in my
senior year I ditched the youth group
and ended up with a core group of
friends and we got along great and
everything was awesome and then I
graduated and I lost touch with all of
them for a very good reason but we'll
save that for another video that was
that was one of those times I wish I
could go back and change but I can't
Christina thisis asked a bunch of
questions but I'm gonna go ahead and
answer this one that says how do you
keep your collection under control with
all the products you purchase and get
sent from brands we do a declutter video
I usually do my declutter videos in the
spring the way that I organize things is
right now it's a mess because I I have
gotten a lot of things like especially
after I got back from generation Beauty
New York I had
organize before I left and then when I
got back since then I it's gone all to
mess but my organization system is just
to organize things into drawers but I
don't I don't have to like stack them
evenly or neatly or anything they just
kind of all get pushed so all my
highlighters and contours are in one
drawer all my lipsticks are in another
drawer I shadow palettes are in a couple
of drawers and in here you know I've got
and I've got like primers in one drawer
and foundations and powders in another
drawer so I just kind of throw em all in
and I know which drawers for what that's
the way that I organize and I do have an
Alex store system from Ikea and then she
also asked if you could pick any brand
which would you like to do a
collaboration with and this is kind of
the way I feel about it the brands that
I mentioned as far as you know my
favorite eyeshadow brands those would be
the ones I want to collaborate with
devious place and coloured raine because
they're black on beauty brands I would
never expect them to collaborate with me
unless they were doing like a you know
you know multiple skin tone promotion or
something like that so I kind of like
help them out lorac I would love to work
with one day I think they're amazing and
Kat Von D I don't think I'm edgy enough
for her so I think the best shot of God
is lorac okay okay Michelle asked if the
opportunity came to do both as one job
would you combine your two career paths
makeup and teaching if you did not know
I did teach for 11 years technically it
was 10 years I taught eight years in
special education both in a
self-contained class which was kids with
disabilities that were all together and
I taught them all day and also an
inclusion where I went in and I helped
kids in their general education setting
and then he did two years in fourth
grade as a fourth grade reading teacher
so as far as combining those two careers
um I think that I would like to combine
makeup and teaching in the product
development world I do have a video
coming out for the brand collab which is
a Sally Beauty brand that's the look
that I have on today that I'll show you
all the products that I'm wearing today
in that video but I would love to do
things like that where I would work with
a brand behind the scenes to develop
their products that's kind of my way
that I would like to you know get my
teaching in there and I wouldn't it
wouldn't be like necessarily like a
collab where my face would be on it but
it would just be in helping the brand to
improve their products
that would be a way I feel like I could
combine makeup and teaching but I don't
see myself as being like a makeup
instructor or anything like that I don't
feel like I have the skill level or the
desire really to do that I had to people
ask this question Tweedles tweet
something tweet with some letters and
grace how did you meet Stephanie Nicole
Stephanie and I have been subscribed to
each other's channels for a long time we
both respect each other's work I did
come up with this idea for this project
and I approached her if you don't know I
did a collaboration with Stephanie
Nicole who is a very respected YouTube
reviewer so I had this idea to do this
travel trip I guess it was maybe six
months ago something like that and I
knew I wanted to collaborate with people
that I admired and I respected so
Stephanie of course came to mind as one
of the first people I wanted to
collaborate with so I just sent her a
message on Twitter and I was like hey
you know I because we've talked back and
forth on social media I said hey you
know I've got this idea what do you
think and she said yes so I flew out and
I hung out with her and if she lived
closer I know that we would be good
friends it's one of those things where
you know it was great experience because
I got to spend time with someone that I
admired and I still admire of course and
she's just such a cool person to hang
out with we had so much fun her and I
and my friend Nicole from the channel
yay or nay Nicole three of us hung out
all day and it was just a blast and we
had great conversation about makeup not
makeup and I wish that they live closer
makes me say oh but but yeah that's how
I met her is just through online through
knowing each other's channels and just
kind of chatting back and forth
Lisa Elizabeth wants to know what
inspired you to start what's up in
makeup and why did you choose YouTube as
your platform so let's start with why I
chose YouTube there's my platform I
started off on YouTube in 2006 I had a
channel called Jenna love 37 it is still
there it is an inactive Channel I've
always loved being in front of a camera
I was in theater when I was in high
school I've always loved this kind of
stuff and I've always wanted to do
something in the public eye that was
something I've always enjoyed and I've
loved helping people and teaching and I
feel like it kind of blends all of those
things I think YouTube is a natural
thing for me to want to do based on Who
I am so I did that channel from 2006 to
2009 I ended up getting accessed from my
position at my job
right when I was pregnant with my son so
I took a year off and I just took care
of my kids I homeschool homeschooled my
daughter for a year and that was my 11th
year of teaching I homeschooled her I
went to an AC convention which is an
early child convention down in Florida I
was helping my teacher friends remotely
so I still count that as a year of
teaching even though I wasn't
technically in the classroom but but
yeah so I took a year off then and then
when I went back to work I really wanted
to do something else because I felt like
all I was doing was teaching and
researching for teaching and teaching
and teaching and I needed something from
me and I knew that my old channel was
very um it was very scattered as far as
what it wanted to be and I needed like
some kind of niche and I used to watch a
lot of Marlena from makeup geek and that
was kind of the start of my channels
like oh I like makeup I can do this too
I didn't realize how many makeup
channels there were out when I first
started this channel there already were
a lot but then of course now there's so
many more another channel that was a big
inspiration for me and actually is kind
of a backward inspiration for what's up
in makeup which is the second part of
the conversation is emily noel 83 where
basically I was watch Emily Noelle 83
and she'd say well this new product came
out and this new product came out in
this new product man I'm like is this
girl know all the new product is going
out how did she know this where does she
get her information I was like like oh
my gosh I want to know so I wanted
what's up in makeup to exist I wanted
there to be a makeup news show for me so
that I could know what was new so I
would know what I wanted to review so
that's kind of how it was I knew I
wanted to do it I contacted a few of my
subscribers that I loved and I said hey
do you want to be my reporters do you
want to do this with me and they said
yes and there were you know was five of
them and me and they each had their own
little section that they researched and
they submitted it to me and that's how
we started doing what's it been makeup
and I still love it I mean it's totally
transformed into this whole entity of oh
my gosh just turned into this whole big
thing that it didn't start out like it's
still basically the same essence in the
core but it's expanded to so much more
thanks to Tabitha who helps me with my
script and everything I mean it's just
it's it's so different if you go back
and watch the first episode of what's
been makeup I'm like
reading from a script' and there's this
weird background and whole different
thing so I'm very happy how it's evolved
but yeah Emily was kind of the
inspiration for me starting because I
wanted to know the new stuff was all she
did and then Deborah Clark wants to know
she says I have a question for the QA
how do you decide what products to
review and part of it is I look at
what's at the make up and I look at
what's interesting to me I also read the
comments under whatsapp and make up I
read my facebook group which is
facebook.com slash groups last watch of
slash what's been make up I look and see
what they're discussing what they're
excited about what's the where's the
buzz and that's what I decide to review
is based on buzz and I was gotten a
conversation on Twitter today about that
and the person was upset because she
felt like my channel was very going more
toward higher end stuff and less
drugstore stuff and she's absolutely
right and I feel like the reason why is
because that's what I'm interested in
and that's what it seems like people in
my comment sections interested in I know
people are interested in drugstore stuff
too but I honestly feel like it's harder
to find the needle in the haystack in
the drugstore so I feel like you know in
a drugstore videos are a lot harder you
know to do I feel like I am busy videos
are more where I feel like I'm really
good at it and I get lost in the
drugstore stuff sometimes but I'm want
to do better and I want to do more
drugstore stuff I had talked about doing
a liquid lipstick Smackdown and I didn't
organize I got the liquid lipsticks I
started testing them but I didn't
organize my data well enough and I kind
of got lost in it and it was so much
easier to just hop into a pallet so I
kind of abandon that because I just
wasn't organized and I didn't get
organized and then new thing came into
my life and I'm like oh pretty birdie
over here and went with that I do have
that like I mentioned the collab video
which is all drugstore stuff coming up I
also have the pallets that shop hush
sent me that I want to review for you
that are supposed to be dupes for
high-end hopefully those will be coming
up next week so there is going to be
more drugstore stuff on the channel I
don't know how much more but that's kind
of where I'm at with it know is it a is
it a good excuse I don't know it's just
that's just the truth
alright smj makeup had also had a bunch
of questions so I'm just gonna pick a
couple she wanted to know how old I am
I'm 39 years old I don't know how that
happened
I don't know
that's how old I am though when or will
when will or when did you feel
comfortable letting your daughter wear
makeup I started wearing makeup at 13
that's kind of when I feel like I would
be comfortable letting her wear some
makeup she's not interested though she
doesn't care she she occasionally will
wear some nail polish she does like nail
polish but she's not interested in she's
9 she's not really interested in makeup
what are your hobbies I don't have any I
don't have time for hobbies I don't I
don't I like I've liked watching a
couple of shows every once in a while
I'm a huge supernatural fan when that's
on I'm like loving it I just I have I
like those like monster kinds of shows
like I really like the originals that's
really good once a vampire one really
like that I really like stranger things
when that was on I've been watched that
I like things like that that those kinds
of shows where it's like kind of thinkI
and wordy like what the scripts are
really good and the characters are
really good those are the things that I
like they don't really have any hobbies
I know that's really sad to say I've got
my kids I love playing with my kids but
personally my hobby is also my job which
is YouTube and that's what I love to do
so yeah I don't really have anything
other than that that's pretty much it I
like games on my app where it's like the
little whenever you switch things and
you make them into the rows of three I
like those kind of apps like the little
diamond apps what is what's the ones I
like this is this is pathetic this is my
hobby right okay so my favorite apps
that I play all the time our home
escapes and garden escapes I love those
I was playing fished them for a while
but I got bored with that because I
don't really care about building a fish
tank she also asked what my favorite who
my favorite favorite character in
Supernatural I have two of them
unfortunately the characters are no
longer in the show no spoilers Bobby and
Charlie were my favorite characters of
all time but they're not in the show
anymore Bert's Museo de and then I
already mentioned other shows I like to
watch so there we go
oh my goodness there's lots of questions
I forgot there's so many questions okay
mine mine 4/20 love beauty do you need
high-end brushes to get the best out of
your products I personally don't feel
like I have enough experience with super
high-end brushes I do have some Sigma
brushes I have a couple of Wayne Goss
brushes and honestly I don't notice that
much difference in my makeup application
when I use a high-end brush
a less a good quality less expensive
brush I love my motor brushes I like my
real technique brushes I like I love my
Luxy brushes those are kind of where I
stay with brushes I don't i've tried
some morphe brushes the ones that I've
tried I haven't enjoyed but they aren't
the ones that people talk about all the
time and I was talking to somebody about
this I was telling them you know I don't
really you know I'm kind of curious
about morphe brushes and whether I would
really like them but I'm not I don't not
curious enough to actually spend money
on them I don't I won't care enough like
I've got I've got plenty of brushes I'll
need any more brushes so you know I'm
not gonna I'm not planning on buying any
if people really wanted me to I probably
would but I don't really want to be
honest with you but no I don't at this
point I don't think there's much of a
difference between not and we're not
talking to natural hair versus synthetic
I'm talking about like high-end versus
really nice less expensive brushes I
don't personally see much difference but
again my experience with more expensive
brushes like Japanese brushes and stuff
is very limited Marty Koh who I also
absolutely adore comments my videos all
the time you're the worst beauty
collection released that you can
remember the Too Faced holiday 2016
collection was atrocious it was one of
those things where you looked at it and
it was so beautiful and some of the
stuff smelled really good but the
quality of the products was just
atrocious it was so bad I do feel like
they improved this year though I do have
one of the Too Faced holiday releases
for this year and I'm really hoping I
can get you that before the holidays at
least you know I'm hoping be able to
tell you about but actually well like I
got the planner one and it's not bad
especially compared to last year last
year was terrible
Tam's another person that I adore says
what was the first product you reviewed
on your channel I think it was a
collective review but I know one of the
products that was in there was the Urban
Decay vice palette the original one was
on there and Tao I see I recognize all
these names I love these people how do
you manage eight videos a week including
a very long whatsapp and makeup and two
kids at the same time well I do a lot
thankfully both my kids are at school
all day which helps a lot I do a lot of
work while they're at school I get up in
the morning my husband takes care of
them for breakfast in the morning and
then I get up we walk them to the bus
stop I start my work I work all day til
they get off the bus I help them with
their homework I make dinner sometimes
I'll work a little
or all play with them it just kind of
depends what kind of mood they're in and
then after that though I'll put them to
bed and then I'll work until like
midnight one o'clock in the morning
people sing on Twitter like Jen isn't it
one o'clock in the morning there
shouldn't you be going to bed it's like
yes but I don't like to sleep I'd like
to be awake I always felt like sleeping
is such a waste of time you know like I
like to sleep but I don't love to sleep
I I wish I didn't have to sleep but you
gotta sleep I wish I could just get more
work done that would be amazing
well yeah I just you for a long time I
just didn't sleep much especially when I
was working full-time and had my youtube
channel full-time there was a period of
time when I was actually getting my
master's degree and doing YouTube and
working full-time and I had my kids in
my house and everything that was a crazy
year that was it for two years two years
took me to get my master to three oh no
how many years it was a while though
that last year was brutal the last year
I was got my master degree was crazy
but I just didn't sleep and I just
worked I worked my butt off I just
worked and worked and worked and work
oh and then the other big thing as
Sundays is our family day so I do my
chat in the morning and the rest of the
day I just spent on my family which i
think is really important caitli wanted
to know if I could do a skincare routine
video I just did my best damn Beauty
skincare routine now I am just kind of
taking a break from doing any reviews
for skincare and I'm just enjoying the
skincare that I have I went back to a
lot of my polish toy stuff I'm using
another brand that they had sent me some
products trying out some of their stuff
but I'm not doing any kind of formal
skincare like testing products reviews
right now I'm just kind of trying to
chill with my skincare and just relax
with it so I don't know if I might do an
updated skincare routine video at some
point but I have I've only been in this
for what like three weeks something like
that so it's not really a good time to
do it but maybe one day I'll do another
one but if you want to see my best damn
beauty one I can link that one down
below so this is kind of a combination
between Nadine who's been around forever
and Sarah
Nadine wanted to know how I met my
husband and about can I introduce my
pets which I already talked about a
little bit and then Sarah wanted to know
a basic overview about my family so I do
have a daughter named Lila she's 9 and
my son is John the fourth and he is 6
and then my husband
we've been married since 2005 we dated
for about a year and a half
before we got married but it was one of
those things where we just knew you know
within like a month
we like knew it's one of those things we
met at a New Year's Eve party he was 20
and I was 24
he is quite a bit younger than me even
though he's definitely more mature than
I am and he's more responsible than I am
he's amazing he's an incredible person
and yeah we met at a New Year's party he
is the stepbrother of my friend Amy my
friend Amy and I we worked it out back
Steakhouse together we waiting tables
together and it's kind of a crazy story
it's one of those fake kinds of stories
where I was supposed to go to a party
with a different friends not a party but
it was like a bar and like hang out at a
bar and it was the same bar we always
hang out what that was like was the same
people in the same bar I was like I got
it out of this town you know and then my
friend Amy was going out of this party
in Virginia and I was like yeah go on
can I go with you because I just I want
to leave I'm gonna get out of here it's
like sure so we drove down there and
she's like I think you might like my
brother I was like how old your brother
forgot and she's like he's 20 he's 21 my
sis dude the 20 year old he can't even
get in the bar with us like what are we
supposed to do with this kid she's like
I don't know I just I think you might
like my brother I was like all right
cool I was like he's the guy that's
doing tattoo stuff he's like she's like
yeah I was like cool so we get there and
we pull up in the driveway and here
comes her brother up the driveway and I
was like oh your brother is kind of cute
immediately I was like oh he's kind of
cute so the night goes on and you know
we basically ended up both drinking a
little too much and kind of making out a
little bit and you know I pretended to
fall asleep on the couch because I
wanted things to like end with like a
little bit of kissing and being done so
so I pretended to fall asleep on the
couch so that he would go on his merry
way and we woke up in the morning and he
was really nice to me and he gave me
hugs and he asked my phone number and
usually when you like drunk make out
with somebody a lot of times it's like
so you know and they're like yeah see
you around you know it's like whatever
but he was so nice he was like really
really nice and he wanted to get in
touch with me like he was like he's like
Amy I want to see your friend Volvo and
I was like okay so we ended up going out
on a date and like I guess was within
like three three weeks to a month we
were driving back and forth to see each
other and he ended up basically moving
in with me like after like a month of
dating and and the rest is history we
ended up getting
married in 2005 and yeah things are good
things are great you know he's my best
friend and I love him very very much and
he's an amazing person and I can't
imagine life without him he's fantastic
I will link some videos down below with
him we used to do birch box unboxings
he's hilarious he's very very funny I
will link some of those down below in
case you want to see what his
personality is like okay this is getting
really really long so I'm just gonna do
one more Jennifer wanted to know about
my perfect my favorite perfume scents
and I honestly don't have a lot of
favorite perfume since I'm a scent
bird-like addict I love simpered I get
sent Birds sent to me because for every
referral I get I get a free perfume so
I've basically got free perfume for life
because now I get 12 referrals that's a
year and you know I've gotten you know
40 or so you know referral so I have a
lot of referrals I don't know how many I
have but I have a lot of referrals so I
get these little simpered vials and I
love them and I just grab one and I you
know whenever I do live chat and we do
perfume we go it's perfume grab bag time
it's perfume ground and grab perfume so
we do perfume grab bag and I grab in and
I grab one but I don't really have
favorite scents but I do want to mention
that my favorite fragrance reviewer is
back on YouTube
his name is the Frey go haul ik and I am
so I love this guy I love him he is so
insanely detailed and his fragrance
reviews he's so good he's like back old
school as far as like camera quality and
editing all that like he's super
old-school cuz he just came back from
like a three-year break like I don't
know maybe a week ago something like
that I'm so excited he's back because I
love his fragrance reviews he's very
very detailed he's like he smells these
things I don't even know how he smelled
was like the different you know the the
notes and everything he's amazing so if
you're looking for a good fragrance
review channel check out the Frago holic
I will link his channel down below he's
gonna be like where did all these people
come from he doesn't know who I am I
think the last time I've tried to leave
comments on his videos he's never
answered me or anything like he has no
idea yeah alright in the last one I'm
gonna answer is from Lindsey it says hi
Jenna I would love to know how you've
become such an incredible mother and an
overall great human being can you share
your life's philosophy one thing I want
to make sure that people know and know
that I know is that I am not perfect by
any means
I make mistakes I make mistakes every
day I make mistakes my kids I make
mistakes on my channel I make mistakes
all the time but I think what's really
important when I make a mistake is that
I try really really hard to learn from
my mistakes you know I think that
treating people the way that I want to
be treated is the way that I've always
lived my life but not everybody wants to
be treated the way that I want to be
treated and I think that's where
sometimes I've run into this really
weird gray area where I would like to be
treated one way but then other people
may not want to so it looks like I'm
being mean when I'm really just trying
to treat other people the way I want to
be treated you know what I mean
so it gets a little weird sometimes but
I feel like that's where I make the most
mistakes is learning that where I met my
growth point right now is learning you
know that my perspective isn't always
the same as everybody else's and I think
that's a society thing too is that you
know we need to understand that just
because we feel a certain way about
politics or about products or about you
know what a certain situation should be
or what someone should do doesn't mean
that everybody else is gonna feel that
way and it doesn't mean that we have the
right to impose what we feel is right on
other people I feel like that's what
makes America wonderful is that we have
a right to have our own opinions and to
be able to express those opinions freely
and to allow people to disagree with us
and I feel like that's where I'm kind of
in my growth phase right now I do feel
like I am a good person I'm a very
confident person I did go through
periods of time in my life when I was
not a confident person I've worked very
hard to be as confident as I am and I
think sometimes that comes off as being
kind of a know-it-all or being pompous
but it's just I just feel like I know
what I'm talking about when I know what
I'm talking about but that doesn't mean
that other people don't have a right to
think differently than I do you know
what I mean I feel like I'm in a good
place on YouTube where I have the
opportunity to learn from my subscribers
from you and from other people that
comment in my comment section of my
videos I think that's just such a
wonderful opportunity I feel like my
philosophy on life basically is really
just being kind to other people and
looking out for other people and some
people don't want to be looked out for
and some people don't really need
someone to be kind to them in that
moment and I think I always still have
trouble figuring out
those those things sometimes but I every
day I feel like I get better with every
mistake if you're not following me on
Twitter I try to I've been on Twitter a
lot I love Twitter because it's like
very instant it's very fast I can put up
little motivational things I love my
Twitter account so I've been over there
a lot lately I'd make sure your follow
me over there I also have a snapchat I
have an Instagram Instagram is mostly
product pictures I'll do I'll look if I
get new products or something I'll show
them on the Instagram you know the
little insta snaps or whatever but I
mean there isn't really a whole lot of
me personally on my Instagram for
getting know me more personally you
don't want to follow me on Twitter and
follow me on snapchat I'd kind of go off
on the mouth at the mouth on Twitter
sometimes which is kind of interesting
to see because you don't see me go off
at the mouth as much on my YouTube
channel and then on snapchat sometimes
I'll just kind of broth so it's seeing
that more laid-back relaxed me is
definitely captured most on Twitter and
snapchat so I hope you like this Q&amp;amp;A I
hope you enjoyed it I know that it was
long hopefully you were available you
were able to use the skip ahead buttons
down in the description down below since
this is a long video hopefully we were
able to use those to your advantage if
you didn't know they were there I'm
sorry because I just realized I really
wanted to put them there because I
realized how long this video is but but
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
have any additional questions I will be
doing another one of these at some point
I would say maybe in like another six
months or something you can always ask
me questions on Twitter though I'm
always on Twitter or like all the time I
don't respond as much to Instagram or
snapchat as well as I respond on Twitter
Twitter's really the best way to get to
me thanks to everybody for submitting
questions I really appreciated it it was
really fun video to film and hopefully
you had a good time watching it too
again thank you so much for watching and
for caring I appreciate you I look
forward to getting to know you better in
the comments below and I'd love to you
