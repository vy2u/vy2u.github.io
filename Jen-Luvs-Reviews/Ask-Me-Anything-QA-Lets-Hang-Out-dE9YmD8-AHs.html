new formats where I'm like so just whoa
I feel like I'm up too high like I'm
looking
excuse me for shaking you is that better
Oh what is happening it's a little bit
better it's not quite as like let me hug
you
how's everybody doing today welcome to
the weekly what's it make them chat I'm
so happy to be here with you oh my
goodness everybody's flooding and hello
everybody the way that this is working
now is there's no pre-notification it's
just when I go live everybody's notified
and there's already 134 people here in
the first 49 seconds that is so cool
but yes today I figured we would just do
like an axe me ask me anything Q&amp;amp;A we
haven't done one of these in a little
while and I thought it would be fun to
just hang out and just talk about makeup
and just let you all just kind of go
nuts and ask questions you can ask
questions that the community can ask
questions of me whatever you want to do
I did want to show you I was trying to
get it up today I don't think it's gonna
happen
plus three videos on the channel one day
might be a little bit much I did I was
not expecting it I did get the new deepa
2d palette from Laura Lee she did send
it to me I did order it it's coming on
Monday but she did send it to me so I
spent most of the day today my family
was kind of running errands and doing
things so I was like you know what I'm
just gonna try to get this video up
because everybody's gonna be getting
theirs on Monday I did a first
impression with swatches and then
there's gonna be a full review like my
normal style later on on the channel
after I've had time cuz you know I'm
still working on the k'kaw Mario palette
and by now everybody's forgotten about
it that's the worst thing about being
thorough in an environment where
everybody is okay with first impressions
you know what I mean so it's like by the
time I get it up I know there's a core
part of my audience that is really going
to still love the k'kaw Mario video but
it's like it's been out for like a month
at this point because I just had a bunch
of other videos I wanted that I kind of
already had in queue and I was testing
it and I'm secondly ready to review but
I have my monthly favorites coming up
this week and also boxycharm coming up
this week that need to be up before the
end of the month so that's the way it
goes so that's why I wanted to do like a
first impression on this because I know
there's a lot of questions about what it
looks like in person versus the website
on Laura Lee Los Angeles as well as the
video that she filmed so I'll just kind
of give you a quick shot of how it's
looking under the
likes it very much is very difficult to
photograph I will get for that it is
difficult to get those true colors I do
have some pictures that I tuned
specifically on my Instagram and just
general OHS reviews over there or you
can find them on Twitter if you're
curious about
I made sure like I held the palette up
to my computer and like won't work this
and I tried to match it to make sure
that it was exactly the same so it's as
close as I could get it and then the
swatches that you're gonna see tomorrow
morning are going to be the same way so
I'm really excited for you to see that
because I wanted to try to help you
clarify some of those misconceptions
because I feel like that's something
that's going to either make people want
to to to buy it or not because the two
pictures did look quite different so it
is going to be a little bit short of a
video but I do think it's gonna be very
informal it's short in that it's 20
minutes and not thirty and it's not
gonna be fully tested because I can't
get a video out that fast fully tested
it's just not possible so I thank you
bye so much for being here I do want to
show you that first and now I'm just
gonna go ahead and say hello very
quickly to the collective braids of

McKenna and Monica and Mariah and
Consuelo and everybody else thank you so
much for being here I appreciate you so
much so let's go ahead and get into some
comments and questions from the
community and let's see we're going to
chat about never know what's gonna
happen in this conversation this is a
really good ones listen to kind of like
Cass while you're doing other things too
so we'll probably won't be showing too
much on the screen Natalie says haven't
watched your cloud with Emily but can't
wait to oh my gosh the experience I'm
going to go visit
Emily Noel 83 was a serious dream come
true like I still can't believe that it
happened I'm still trying to digest that
because this is it's a huge huge deal
for me to have been able to go out there
and spend time with her and she is
amazing she's absolutely amazing so I'm
so thankful and the video that's over on
her channel is really really good it's a
very not traditional anti haul where you
know we kind of talk about something
that's coming out of something we don't
plan to buy and then we kind of talk to
each other about it and then some
instances we almost convince each other
that maybe we do want it which is really
cool it's very different for an anti
whole so if you don't usually dig anti
hauls definitely recommend you check
over it Emily's channel and check that
one out because it's definitely
different it's probably one of the most
positive anti haul as I've ever seen or
done let's see
Amanda says you're Emily Noel video
reminded me of Beauty news I wish more
channels did this type of format yes and
if I had another person I think Beauty
news came up with a great idea to be
able to have two people discussing these
things if I had someone that I could
bring on all the time
they're very lucky to have each other I
definitely I think it's a great format I
definitely do
hello in Paris and Monica I love the
club that was awesome thank you so much
um Marg Essex says what's your favorite
shade to do a monochromatic look you
know what I really love is the dose of
colors mom's palette oh my gosh it is so
beautiful if you've never tried the dose
of colors eyeshadow palettes they are
all are monochromatic and they are so
buttery and creamy and easy to blend and
easy to work with they've got a really
nice gradient from light to deep so it's
really easy to get that beautiful
monochromatic look so that is by far my
favorite palette to use for a
monochromatic look no doubt about it no
doubt about it
Rebecca says I'm so fed up with the word
nude I'm going to record a video on it
on my channel you know what and I don't
see for me I don't have any problem with
the word nude and with nudie patootie
specifically she was using nude
light medium and deep shades and that's
where I have an issue is when it's only
used for light shades that's when I have
an issue like we were saying what's up
in makeup today though the owner of
Beauty bakery how she was saying you
know in some ways that that women of
color are seen as second you know
they're like an afterthought a second
and it's just not right it's so messed
up so it's nice to see nude shades in
different tones in light medium and deep
tones you know respect the nude miss you
know but urban decay shirt it starts
something with that nude stuff I at
least would for me that's the first nude
makeup that I I came in contact with
Garrett hello Garrett what is your
all-time favorite makeup brand for
drugstore hmm
drugstore priced drugstore I would
probably have to say NYX has the most
hits for me but they do have a lot of
misses for me as well
I feel like L'Oreal has some a lot of
really good hits for me but also some
misses as well I don't think there's
there's well I don't know
are there any brands that have
everything that I like there's not a
single there's always things I don't
like from different brands but if I had
to pick I would say either Nick's or
L'Oreal probably NYX is more consistent
for me Kristin I want it oh no it went
down I hate when that happens Rebecca
are you the same color nude as the next
person
my dad is 7 times darker than me and the
color nude would not be the same for
both of us exactly exactly
Steph says Oh Steph hi Steph would love
to see a nudie pic Trudy on darker skin
me too looks like it'll pull chalky on
anything other than fair and one thing
here to note and this I mentioned in the
video tomorrow is that this whole top
row is very light and then you get into
some mid-tone shades here in these four
and these two actually quite dark I feel
like they look darker in the swatches
that you'll see tomorrow they definitely
are much darker than the ones that the
way they appeared on Laura's channel in
my opinion fbh 16 what product that has
been your favorite from a youtuber
product collab
you know honestly if I if I want to be
completely 100% honest my favorite
product from collabs I think there's a
tie and they're both people that I know
can be very controversial but I were
talking about products not people this
is about the products not the people
behind them any tip you may have with
them cast it aside because this is a
channel of positivity you tell have been
watching ad from potlucks I don't think
I got it exactly right without what's
close this is a channel of positive
energy okay sorry I had to but anyway I
would probably say the Jacqueline ho
morphe palette and the mani mua oh for a
liquid lipstick collab
we're definitely my favorites I think
the camera just moved they say I can
straighten you a little bit there we go
it's on a very weird surface those
probably would be my favorite but it
skipped out again Renee what are your
thoughts about coloured raine and makeup
geek going to target and are they
considered drugstore now they're gonna
have to be considered drugstore because
they're sold at the drugstore I think
that they're redefining what drugstore
means and I think that's kind of crazy
you know to read of buying that price
point I don't think that it's out of
line to think that a drugstore customer
might purchase coloured raine or what
makeup geek has always been on the edge
of drugstore prices I mean if you think
about Physicians Formula their prices
are a little bit more than the typical
drugstore I mean I know there's lots of
sales usually on Physicians Formula but
I feel like makeup geek can compete with
drugstore pricing Co and reign on the
other hand I mean we're talking 50
dollar pouch $20 lip liquid lipsticks
things like that they're definitely more
of a Sephora type brand as far as
pricing goes I guess they're gonna hide
on't know what I don't know what we're
gonna do because they're throwing us for
a loop they're honest aren't they
they're they really are they're throwing
us for a loop with that I I'm a little
confused on what we're gonna have to do
I mean there's it's just kind of crazy
it's really crazy so I guess but I don't
know how color reigns gonna do you know
because typically the drugstore consumer
is looking for something that is less
expensive than 50 dollars and if they
don't know coloured raine I mean you
think about what someone goes in to
target the typical Tarte customer
probably doesn't watch youtube videos
from
make up you know they walk down the
aisle they kind of glance around they
look and see what they might want you
know they need new mascara they look
that which one has the nicest packaging
they put it in their cart you know maybe
look at the images on the on the thing I
mean they're not gonna know how amazing
colored rain is so I don't know I don't
know and chances are I would imagine
they're not gonna have like place you
can touch them because if size shutters
are so good I am very happy for them I
hope that it goes well for all of those
brands Natalie I love trying makeup just
just wish I had unlimited money storage
space I know right totally with you okay
city of the silent you talked a bit
about sephora's treatment of brands I've
heard similar things as to why other
brands left but they killed OCC it seems
that they did and if you remember I'm
trying to remember what his name is the
man that he's a makeup artist and he's
super super famous and last time I tried
remember his name I couldn't Kevin James
Bennett there we go it came to me he had
said in a post on his Instagram when OCC
went and our there was a we put the
image up because it was a really
interesting image of a gravestone that
had the OCC logo on it and he basically
in that I don't want to misquote him but
on his page he blamed Sephora for that
that it was the forests fault so now we
have a little more clarity as far as
what what that was and what could have
happened to them and it seems very
likely that it did Drive them under and
it makes sense it's just it really
stinks because it sounds like they just
didn't follow all the way through on
some of the things the legal aspects in
the beginning and then when it didn't
sell well which it's I don't remember
ever seeing Sephora really promote OCC
so I don't know if that kind of assisted
with that that's a for wasn't pushing
them so I don't know I mean I know I
didn't buy anything from OCC it so
forever and I don't know why I didn't
but I didn't I don't know I don't know
and actually I tried last year I felt
reef L in love with their the liquid
lipsticks so I'm really sad to see that
- is one of my favorite shades of all
time
so really sad but it's just one of those
things I mean these big corporations a
lot of them do not care about the little
guy they just want their bottom line and
if the little guy can bring them up fine
but if the little guy falls oh well you
know it's pretty sad
all right FBO another FB age 16 the same
person again it's good makeup geek is
going to be drug sources most drugstore
brand palates don't have the best
eyeshadow palettes but the manic lab
palette for example is not a drugstore
price okay I see I did not purchase that
so I'm I don't know about that one but
that makes sense Debbie Debbie hi Debbie
green she says do you think Tara Skeeter
is keeping the bad make up for free
publicity never heard of them before you
report on this no I don't I think that
they just don't I have a feeling they
just don't know I think that we tagged
them on Twitter a couple of times I
think we tagged them on Twitter and they
just haven't done anything about it we
have a Harris Teeter not far from us I
think it's just an East Coast thing it
may just I don't know how what locations
Harris teeters are in but I don't I
don't think so I don't think they even
know about the show to be honest I think
that people that have hair ceders go to
them it's like you know Publix we don't
have a Publix but people that have
Publix go to Publix say I don't know I
don't I don't think so that's just my
opinion
a lot of people are saying they've never
heard of OCC Shari says she's never
heard of OCC oh here we go Alice says
pet peeve on beauty skincare products is
derm adult dermatologist tested
unless did a dermatologist hate it I
love it what the dermatologists say
after they tested it so true so true in
order to say dermatologist tested all
they have to do is have a dermatologist
test it and is there was ologist doesn't
we throw those throws out there and
dermatologist approved how many one do
one or the other tend to say did eight
of them hate it and do them love it oh
it's dermatologist approved because
don't liked it yeah it is it's marketing
it's not marketing sound scam marketing
Rebecca bites no is there a way to
contact the brand to tell them about
harris-teeter yeah probably that's
definitely something we can look into
doing honestly I just have it and
and I want to tell you also something
that's important about what's in the
makeup is that I don't write the script
for what's up in makeup I don't find the
harris-teeter I didn't do the jingle I
don't all I do for whatsapp and makeup
is I film it I film it
I added it I approve everything that
goes in of course and that's all I do
with it as I film it and edit it it's
the information is gathered by the
reporters it's put together by Tabitha
all the jokes that are in there I would
say 95% of the jokes or Tabitha's jokes
they're not my jokes I just say them and
you know I think that's important for
for viewers to know I definitely approve
them but but it's a team effort it that
what stupid makeup is the only well one
of the only things on my channel that is
it's really a team effort it's not just
me because I couldn't do this by myself
it's way too much for a production I
mean there's so much behind the scenes I
was telling Emily a little bit about
what sets makeup and you know how much
goes in behind the scenes she was like
wow she like he could do like a whole
documentary on the behinds Ethan what's
the makeup I was like I don't know watch
it but we could we could because it's a
lot a lot of things going on behind the
scenes and I had Tabitha thank for a lot
of that because she does she does a lot
of good things for the show and helps
kind of hold make she's like the glue
that holds everything together and and
keeps things going smoothly I could
probably do it by myself but it wouldn't
be what you see it would be probably
five or six top news items which might
include some new releases maybe in 8 to
10 minutes show every week it wouldn't
be what it is now without the team
there's no way I couldn't do it it's not
possible it's it's so much work so you
have to split it up between a bunch of
people or else it's just just couldn't
do it so yeah so as far as like reaching
out to harris-teeter and the hair see
her story that's actually not my story
that's one of our reporters stories so
I'll talk to her and what maybe we'll
work together on trying to reach out to
like Revlon and those companies
especially red line with the hairs
Teeter and try to get them to do
something about it because we don't want
anybody to get sick I would rather the
story not ever exist and have people
have all of these makeup products off
the shelves you know even though I do
like the harris-teeter segment and I do
like the the you know kind of outing
these these places that have these
terrible products that are so old on the
show
it's better for people to be safe you
know Clara says is a lot of work just to
post the ten minute meeting that is very
true
that is very true Steve Steve zero hello
hello I know you have another name and I
it's out of my head right now I know
that it exists though and I know I knew
it at some point I think I knew it at
some point
I have mature under eyes so make up
forever revolutions concealing define is
less drying on me than shape table I
really like the makeup revolution
concealer I am I did purchase that one I
also purchased the color pop and I'm
enjoying both of them very much I've
used makeup revolution one more than the
color pop but I've enjoyed them and
they're over there I would get them and
tell you the shades that I got but
they're over there if I remember I'll
put him in the video description Sydney
wants know if I've tried the hourglass
thick foundation I did and I was not the
biggest fan of it I found that it caked
around my nose and I just didn't like
the finish of it just not my not my
favorite Nicky Murphy is here hello -
Nicky Murphy I moved you again sorry
about that
hear the pitter-patter of little feet
outside my door
make up make up or break up blog Shayla
and colour-pop collaboration care to
comment I think it looks gorgeous I
think it looks absolutely beautiful love
it it looks great I haven't I haven't
tried it or anything yet though Kaylee
wants to know if I am a doctor no my
degrees are in education most of them I
have four degrees actually I have my
first degree is in mental health
I got an associate's degree in that and
then my next degree was in a special
education with a certification in
general education and then my next
degree was in psychology and then my
next degree also undergrad and my next
degree was in elementary reading yeah
elementary reading basically I was going
to try to be a reading specialist before
I quit teaching but um but yeah well I
took a lot of research courses and stuff
so that's where I kind of get my
research background because when I was a
but I got a double major in psychology
so for education and psychology you both
have to be well-versed in research and I
really liked that part I actually
thought about going into educational
research at one point that was one of my
possible career paths
I also was thinking about going into
educational psychology where you would
do like testing and data analysis and
stuff like that that was another
possible career path for me so going
into like the ingredient analysis and
all that and being really analytical
with my makeup reviews is where I
naturally fell after I didn't take those
paths I've always wanted I've always
loved research and you know but I'm not
a doctor I did get a really cool skin
care book though from my friend Nancy
that's here off to show you at some
point it's really cool it's like the
skin flip book and it tells you all
about the skin so next time I do a skin
care review off to show you my really
cool flip book the Nancy got for me I'm
excited about it
Kimberly Rose beauty with Kimberly Rose
Jenn is amazing I found so many great
channels from Jenn that's how I found
icky Murphy yeah Rebecca I have blue
purple black under-eye circles I have a
very hard time trying to cover them you
have any suggestions on what to use to
cover them I've tried peach salmon red
pink and yellow
I would think salmon would work for you
salmon doesn't work for you that would
be my suggestion that would be what I
would have said was salmon is it just
not enough coverage have you tried the
eve pearl salmon concealer that one is
really really really really good but I
don't have super super dark purple black
under-eye circles I don't know where you
would be able to try that though I don't
think they sell those like in department
stores and stuff so I don't know if you
could try that free bought it what their
return policy is and stuff but that
would be the one would be a salmon
concealer from Yves pearl because it's
super full coverage but it's not like
cakey full coverage at least from mine
excuse me from my memory I bought about
two years ago I don't have it anymore
maybe three years ago now kennedy's
going to school would be a secondary
English teacher best of luck to you I
hope it goes well for you
hany says did you learn a lot off of
Emily yes I don't know if I well I have
I learned a lot I loved watching her do
her makeup in person it's amazing how
she gets those colors to go together it
just blows me away she's so talented
with makeup I did ask her about whatsapp
and makeup I did ask her I said you know
do you have any advice being a former
newscaster she asked me you know if I
had a news background I told her no
she's like I can't believe you don't
even use background I'm like no I don't
but I'm a took that is a huge compliment
I was kind of freaking out but she said
the biggest thing is to keeping your
tone trying to keep it as conversational
as possible which is extremely
challenging to keep your tone when
you're reading something like that to be
conversational because it's not a
conversational thing to say you know if
you think about the words that I'm
saying they're not something you would
say to somebody in a conversation so to
try to keep that natural is really
difficult so that was kind of her
biggest suggestion was to try to make
sure I'm really focusing on that tone
and I hopefully in the past couple of
weeks you've noticed my efforts in that
trying to keep that tone a little more
lighthearted than conversational Arwen
says oMG Jemma kimberly-clark Club I
would love that
and actually I tried to work that out at
one point believe it or not about a year
ago and she was in New York and I told
her I said if you're in New York and you
have time let me know I will come up I
will meet you and then she was kind of
like well I don't really have my stuff
when I'm in New York so I was like well
I will come down to Florida at some
point I don't care I want to collab with
you this was you know like a year ago
something like that and then she got
really busy and now she's on tour so
that would definitely be something I
would love to do in the future I would
love to collab with Kimberly I think
she's amazing but she is uh you know
she's busy right now she's doing her own
thing and I'm very proud for I'm very
excited for her I hope she comes back
the next year to Kelly I do Missy says
any thoughts on the repackaging or deal
if you don't know about the repackaging
or deal that I believe Missy is speaking
about it's about when a brand uses a
packaging that was meant for something
else whether it was a new product that
didn't come through or a product that is
discontinued but they have extra
packaging around and then they reuse
as something else I have 100% no
problems with the reuse of packaging I
think that it is very smart
I think it's eco friendly I think that
it's great I love the idea where I don't
love it is when they take the exact same
product they put it in that packaging
and then they label it as something else
that I don't like I don't like that that
is not cool at all like for example if I
had you know this was my palette and it
was called nudie patootie and then I put
a sticker over the top and I called it
the fruity patooty that would not end it
was the exact same thing inside no that
would not be cool and I sold it as
something completely different but it
was the same thing that's a very
dramatic example of course but like for
powders foundations things like that
where you might not be able to tell the
difference if it's in you know labeled
differently you may not realize it until
you actually try it and you think you're
buying a new product but you're not kind
of like the Tarte foundation situation
where they had the old foundation that
was in the jar they repackaged it and
called it the tart hydrating foundation
it was the same ingredients in the same
order it's possible that there may have
been a slightly different modifications
even though the ingredient list is in
the same order it's possible that they
had a little bit different formulation
but honestly I seriously doubt it
I really knew I would seriously doubt it
I would so that's the thing that I don't
mind that I don't like but what I don't
mind is the reuse of packaging and
trying to minimize waste I think that's
wonderful
ok let's see
Nathalie hi Jen I love your videos you
know anything about the reformulations
of Sunday Riley good jeans I tried to
order one yes in the website says being
reformulated so it's unavailable no I
know nothing about that Stephanie Nicole
would be a great place to ask about that
I would imagine she she might know
something maybe I haven't talked to her
in a while though I haven't talked to
her I think I've talked to her once she
moved so she's been going through a lot
of stuff so I think I said still about
100 million times
Margie hi Jen what do you think about
the new Pat McGrath of lip gloss will he
be trying and reviewing it maybe I do
like Pat McGrath products I do find a
lot of them to be
very overpriced I especially the older
stuff the stuff that had come out that
was in really like cheap looking
packaging like those lip kits and
they'll be getting eyeshadows all that
they were really cheaply packaged I mean
it was like is this formula really worth
spending that much really but now
they're really beefing up the packaging
so at least it feels like it might be
more perfect because you're paying for
the packaging but I don't know I don't
know maybe it's definitely possible Jay
Bernie says what do you think of
Jeffrey's video of Kathy Griffin I
didn't watch it I did watch Kathy
Griffin's mother react to it though I he
saw that Kathy Griffin's mother loved it
but I didn't watch that video stephanie
says hi Jan I found you for Emily's
channel shall we Stoke some highly of
you after watching for the first time I
saw why you're both really amazing women
and have amazing channels thank you so
much even having me and Emily in the
same sentence let alone in the same room
so makes me go oh my gosh I mean you
know think about who you know in your
field whatever you do for a living
thinking about the person that you look
up to or somebody that you admire and
you know if there's anybody and you know
your field that writes books or is on
television or you know wherever and
being able to be in that room and have a
conversation and to be able to spend
time with that person I mean it was
incredible it was incredible like I
didn't just it was incredible Monica I
have the velvet Azure powder never used
whatever the packaging used to be but I
like the powder so ok velvet Iser was
one of the things that was repackaged
from the naked powder they slapped a
sticker on it said velvet Iser it is
slightly different in formula than the
original if you watched what's been
makeup last week we did do a story on
that where I did you a little bit of an
ingredient comparison from you know
looking at them myself and there is a
little bit of different there's
something called micro silica that's in
the velvet Iser that's not in the other
one the naked and then the naked has
mica as a at least the lighter one has
mica as does contain where the velvet
Iser has a may contain which it changes
the finish of it where mica is gonna
give pigments color to it the velvet
Iser has it as may contain so it's not
going to have as much
pigment so those are the big differences
between the two but I have heard great
things about that product absolutely
Rebecca says does anybody nurse YouTube
unsubscribing you from people you sub to
I noticed this week a handful of people
i watch daily rag on for my subscription
list yes this is happening Rebecca and
but they're not on subscribing you what
YouTube is doing is if you don't watch a
channel regularly they are removing that
that channel from your subscription feed
and you're still subscribed but they're
not going to notify you of their videos
anymore which i think is ridiculous I
think you should be able to opt-in and
opt-out to something like that I think
that's crazy if I'm subscribed to
somebody there's a reason why I'm
subscribed it's because I want to see
what videos they're putting out and they
makes me so upset like I just died so so
yes if you are if you haven't been
watching the channel for a while or if
you don't watch a lot of their products
you put out a lot of content I put out a
lot of content you only watch maybe one
video you may not be notified of all my
videos and it's just crazy it's
absolutely crazy so so yeah that that
has been happening and that's been
confirmed by someone's like the YouTube
guru people that are like YouTube
certified that they're doing that I
think I even saw that I'm one of
YouTube's YouTube channels so yeah
makeup breakup blog is it a 70 piece
collection with JLo and Inglot yes it is
it's a 70 piece collection but remember
70 pieces means is like let's say
there's 10 lipsticks that's 10 of the 70
so it's not like 70 individual things
it's you know a collection of shades of
things Carrie says fYI you're my first
video subscription I found Emily because
of you all Darren Joe Oh
Thank You Michelle and Thank You Megan
for answering people's questions and and
all of that I appreciate you all so much
Cheryl says if I want to be notified it
passes me off that they can make that
choice for me yeah absolutely it's
messed up zebb favorite indie eyeshadows
and lipsticks I got this one I got this
one okay so favorite indie eye shadows
on him favorite indie eye shadows I
would say mmm geek chic cosmetics nobody
talks about them they're amazing they're
loose pigments they're super fab also I
really love honest I have to tell you I
really do like the Laura Lee once you
look like they don't believe me and it's
like they're really good I'm telling you
they're really good so I was really
excited to come out with another palette
I've only tried on my eyes once that
you'll see tomorrow but I do like the
Laura Lee ones what else trying to think
other ones I really like coloured raine
eyeshadows are ridiculous dubious place
ridiculously amazing I'm looking around
because I need like clues from my
collection of what I've been using for
eyeshadows as far as lips go um oh for
liquid lipsticks or my one of my
favorites I can see my favorite but
they're one of my favorites those are
really really good I like the ronny
cosmetics lipsticks the the spark
dazzling lipsticks the the stick ones i
like them better than the liquid form
those are really really nice if you like
a little bit of like glitter that's not
obnoxious glitter cuz you're really nice
shine
those are the ones I can think up off
the top of my head I know there's more
there's plenty more it's just those the
ones I'm thinking about as far and try
to think other single eyeshadows that I
really like there's a lot of single
eyeshadow brands that I like those are
probably my favorites just off the top
of my head
Mimi says Sydney grace are awesome
shadows I haven't ever tried Sydney
grace never Michael says you did your
top 5 eyeshadow palettes with Stephanie
in a cold video how has that changed at
all from then to now I'd have to look
back and see what I picked I remembered
I did jacqueline hill morphe palette was
in there I still really liked that
palette I honestly haven't used it very
much because I've been using other
palettes to try out so I'm trying I
can't even remember what I put in there
to be completely honest I think I'm
pretty sure I put color drain and Juvia
split no I know I put color drain in
there I know if I put Julia's place but
color drain definitely is still like
they're so good they're so good try to
think what else was in there
can't remember Salas says notoriously
morbid I only own their one of their
contour palettes I don't own any of
their shadow palettes oh wait yes I do
yes I do it's very good yes I do I've
gotten a few requests Missy case has a
review of a shot miss hey I'd be cool I
actually gotten quite a few requests for
a shot miss a I'm a little scared of the
whole poop factor to me if I'm going to
be completely honest with me because a
lot of very inexpensively made cosmetics
there's a reason why they're
inexpensively made because they cut
length they it's possible I don't know
this for a fact but it's possible that
they cut corners in other places such as
cleanliness and that freaks me out so I
don't
I'm nervous did you shot me say I'm not
trying to get an eye infection or my
lips swell up you know it's just that's
not fun and my insurance isn't great I
have insurance but it's not fabulous
I don't wanna go to the hospital Kalen
says essence makes amazing single
shadows you know I don't know if I've
tried a lot of s in single shadows I
should though Oh Michelle says I've
tried a good bit of shot miss a stuff
and it's hit or miss thank you so much
for that Michelle no eye infections or
lip infections for you probably well she
wouldn't say that uh and K and he told
me once how to say your name
aunt ki thank you I think please review
of shop hush I did
there is one of my channel yeah it
already exists I did a review of the
because everybody's mom's different you
know um it just kind of depends on what
your mom is into you know what's really
good if your mom like speech sense they
have that two-faced peach kit on their
website I think or on Sephora
I'm not hopefully it's still available
but it's got a bunch of things in there
and honestly I really liked a lot of
that stuff from that peach collection I
really did I like the powder I like the
primer I like the foundation I think you
get to pick your foundation shade a lot
of really good stuff in that kit that
might be a good one as far as eyeshadows
go if they like I don't know why I'm
long such a two-faced kick right now the
chocolate gold palette from Too Faced
was really really punchy and good and
like the ham so
something more calm trying to think
something more calm
somebody might like and I can't think of
anything off the top of my head I'm sure
there's like a million things but off
time I had a can't think of anything but
I think it's so hard to recommend gifts
you know when you don't know the person
it's really hard
Amy wants to know how the family travel
van is going next vacation yes if you do
not know we bought a Sprinter van and my
husband has spent months decking it out
with he builds a bed in there he put it
on heat and electricity and all kinds of
cool stuff and I am just it's incredible
we took it for a test run and it went
very well this summer the content on the
channel is going to be quite different
this summer I'm going to have a goal of
one video per week this summer because
we are going to be on the road from the
end of June to the end of July and I'll
do an official I'll do like an official
announcement video on that and talking
about that I also hope to start like a
vlog channel so I can keep up with you
through like live streaming maybe some
vlogs here and there but I don't know
how that's gonna go
I did try to do a vlog situation two
summers ago when we did something
similar and it was a disaster it was so
hard to do and I ended up spending a lot
of time away from my family because I
was trying to keep up with YouTube and
it just wasn't worth it so you know
we'll see what happens
this summer but I'm gonna try to do my
husband's even encouraging me he really
wants me to do and I really want to do
one video a week this summer but what's
in the makeup is gonna go on hiatus for
two months because there's no way I can
do it on the road that includes the
makeup minute it's all gonna pause
starting and June through the end of
August
Calem do you have any recommendations
for super colorful palettes I know
that's not really your thing but I find
super colorful unusual shadows are hit
and miss you know what I got it's really
good I showed it and well not really I
don't know if it's really good yet or
not super beauty they have like a cake
palette I think it's over there that
one's really bright and bold and I
enjoyed it the one time that I used it
Julia's place honestly the genius place
masquerade palette I can tell you
tried-and-true I know for a fact that
thing is stinking amazing it is
incredible and any of the genius placed
palettes I feel like
formula is super consistent and super
consistently good like you know some of
those brands he'll try it you know bunch
down you'll really like them and then
there'll be a pallet where you're like
what would even happen here
like how what you know that never seems
to happen with JV this place is just
consistently good that would definitely
be a recommendation and of course
coloured raine but jus vias place I feel
like really nails it on those bright
colors in that uh that mass grade pallet
and I think it's only like 25 30 bucks
something like that it's not super super
pricey Keon wants a shout out with sach
yeah Natalie I got confused oh they
already had Mother's Day in the UK okay
gotcha yeah ours is coming up in May
Oh back winter is here excellent skin
care channel she set it off to get some
breakfast have an awesome night thank
you you too back have a good breakfast
Dahlia says do you recommend the Besame
cosmetics adventures single eyeshadow
set for 3750 yeah I've never tried
Besame eyeshadows the only thing I've
ever tried from Besame is their loose
powder it's like a setting powder that
smells like vanilla and it's amazing but
I've never tried their single eyeshadows
I'm sorry
karen says Suva eyeliner solids are so
good if you want a bright liner or face
artwork activates with water thank you
so much for exiling about that jube josa
the GPS place magic palette is great yes
it is that's another really good one
Oh steffeff says 35% off ingenious place
now yay and he wants to know who would I
collab with next I'm not telling I can't
tell you because it's not as fun if I
tell you ahead of time ruins the game no
spoilers allowed I do have a collab
lined up though for this summer and then
I have an idea I have my eye on somebody
for the fall but I haven't asked him yet
I had one that I had planned for this
month and it fell through I actually I
ended up having to cancel it because I'm
just getting out to Emily and all that
was just it was so much and I just I
just decided I just couldn't do it right
now but the summer while we're traveling
we're gonna do a little code I have
action it's gonna be amazing
Andrea says would you ever collaborate
with a company or come up with your own
palette makeup yes
both but this is the thing about working
with another company is they would have
to understand that I am NOT putting out
something with my name on it that is not
something I a hundred percent believe in
like they would have to be really
patient with me and coming up with my
own makeup I did start a process of
coming out with my own product it was
just one product to start and the lab
that I was working with was not very
cooperative so I killed that project for
now and I am I'm going to I want to go a
switch labs at some point but for now
it's on hold just because I was really
you know I mean you'd really get into
some meat really excited about something
you put a lot of time and energy into it
and then like it all fell through enough
to start over so yeah yeah I was really
sad because that lab seems super cool -
it was the United States all natural
like super really into putting quality
ingredients into their products like
really really good lab and it just
they'd it was just too difficult to work
with them so she stopped responding to
me at some point and I was like I mean
this probably isn't a good match so I
just let it go but yeah I would love
that I have a I have ideas in my head
for a makeup brand that I've had for a
couple of years and it's just so
expensive it's so expensive but yeah I
would love to and you know I don't even
care if people will be like at just
another youtubers on it make it my mom I
don't care we're just doing because I
want to do it because I am an individual
person I could do what I want with my
money in my time and if people can not
like it all they want I don't care cuz
it would be so fun will be so fun and
the ideas I have I think are really
really good I do
Seth says this a secret thing that
nobody thought of yet yes yes and it
wasn't an eyeshadow palette or anything
like typical it was something very very
very unique in my opinion it was very
unique
but and the lab was all about it at
first and then the more we got into it I
didn't think they were the right lab
let's see what else we got going on
oh he is here hi V from V dreamcatcher
she says I have so much fun making
eyeshadow palettes with some of my
favorite single shadows making eyeshadow
palette with Jessica dream I agree with
you me and my friend Georgia from
Georgia Harris does the same thing and
and yeah I mean it's fun to just put
colors together ah there's so many
things I wish I could just tell you I
won't waste steal my idea and there's
trolls everywhere it's always somebody
trying to get in here and ruin my party
so I can't tell you I would if I could
though I would because it's a really
good idea but leaves I think it is Karen
I just bought the Tarte tingle toner
great results overnight even really you
know I don't know anything about the
Tarte tangle toner somebody asked me the
other day on Twitter if they re if they
discontinued it I don't even know what
this product is I never even heard of
its heart tingle toner I guess because I
mostly I mostly look at makeup Monica
says I splurged on the drunk elephant
baby facial last month and I loved it
sadly lol my bank account didn't yeah I
am on well let me tell you what's
happening with my drunk element stuff
right now because it was not good but
I'm learning and that's why I'm not
reviewing yet because I'm learning I'm
learning okay so drunk elephants sent me
a box full of stuff they sent me the
night serum the day serum the
moisturizer the eye cream the baby
facial the lip balm I was freaking out
it was a bomb I totally freaked I mean
it was like a moment like I was dancing
in my living room because I'm always
want to try junk elephant but it's so so
expensive so I started off with a
moisturizer I'm like okay I'm gonna ease
myself into these products and then I
did halo Beauty so I stopped the drunk
elephant because they didn't want that
interfering with the halo and I went
back to my regular routine that I've
been using and then after I stopped the
halo I just went just deep into it I was
gonna say something just crude but I
can't do that so but yeah I just went
like wait I went all in I've used
everything all at once used it all I was
using the day serum and the night seer
and the veiny facial that the eye cream
the moisturizer I was using everything
hold my face do not like it my face did
not like it at all I started getting
wrinkles right here on my cheeks I'm
sorry but I am not ready for
goals on my cheeks like actual like
wrinkles it was almost like it was
sucking the life out of my skin it was
too much I just did too much so for the
past few days week is almost a week I
went back to using as many hydrating
products as I could I used the belief
aqua balm and I swear that stuff saved
my skin every night I've been using the
belief aqua balm and I really think that
that is what is plumping my skin back up
and now I don't see those wrinkles on my
cheeks anymore so after my skin I give
my skin like a full week of recovery I'm
gonna go in I think I'm just going to
use that see firmer the day serum the
moisturizer and the eye cream and just
leave it at that for a little while and
see how that goes and I'm just gonna
keep playing with different combinations
because using all of them was a bad idea
it was a really bad idea for me so
that's where I'm at in my drunk elephant
journey I really want to use the baby
facial because the baby facial seemed
amazing but I'm scared of overdoing it
and I think the C firma is gonna go bad
first so I want to make sure I use that
and that is what's happening with drunk
elephant that's my story and I'm
sticking to it
but yeah the belief aqua balm I swear
that stuff just plumped everything right
back up so good Arwen says the C firmer
is good I wasn't a fan of their eye
cream though oh good to know good to
know I mean I it was almost like those
like when you see a horror movie and you
see the person like dehydrate that's
like slowly dehydrate I was like in the
early stages of that it was horrible
mrs. bungle 78 says Jen don't worry
about the lab could sell your idea or is
there something in place to prevent that
happening right now there's nothing in
place to prevent that from happening
they could totally steal my idea I don't
think they will just because I got kind
of a feel for the moral compass of the
owner and she seemed she seemed like
that would be something that would be
against it she seemed extremely moral I
like as far as like her ingredients
everything I can't see her doing it but
it's possible that she could she totally
could there's nothing to protect me
because I was an idiot and I didn't go
into it right I was too excited so yeah
she could she could totally rip off my
idea at this point
Beach babies because I'm having anxiety
ever know what's been makeup for two
months I know I'm sorry but it's really
not gonna be possible for me to do it on
the road fbh 16 says I see youtuber skin
routines where they use so many products
my skin doesn't react well to use a lot
of products but looks great
the less I use yeah and I think it's
also the combination because when you
put on a toner and then you put on a
serum and then you put on a moisturizer
and then you put on an eye cream and
then you do a face mask the next day and
then you I mean there's it's like all of
that stuff is mixing in your skin so
finding that right combination for you I
think is really important but yeah I
totally hear that I totally hear that
kitty-kitty pause did you look at the
ingredients to see what could have
potentially caused the wrinkles yes I
think that it was too much it was a
combination of I wish I had them in
front of me but it's the the active
ingredients for some reason my brain is
like melting right now and I can't think
of it's such an easy thing to remember
and I can't remember but it's the active
ingredient that's in the sea ferma the
baby facial and the the night serum I
think it was just too much is it retina
as it retinols but I think it might be
retinol or retinol I wanna say that
because I know the baby facial is 25%
and then the C firma and the night serum
I think had 15% I think I'm saying it
right this is all from my memory I wish
I'd from me I hate not having it in
front of me hey CheY yes yes there you
go AJ probably yes exactly thank you
guys so much for that I appreciate it
yeah and Calum saying the same thing the
VHA AJ yes exactly I think that's it
too much it's the acids thank you guys
so much see y'all know y'all know it's
just you know sitting in front of people
and like heavens you remember things on
the spot I think that's why some people
just don't ever do live streaming
because you say something it's out there
there's no way you can't take it back
and if you forget something
if not you everybody knows you forgot
and you can't take it back
Marge says jung-hwan and polished
Nicole swears that the drunk elephant
eye serum ruined her under eyes oh wow
really oh my god mm I'm sorry to hear
that happened to her Michelle says baby
steps with accept was the age
Ajay's yeah and I did not do that I
would like went in hard man I wanted
full-blown no joke yes that says you
can't use the baby facial with retinol
but but the thing well I I swear I asked
the the person who it's the PR company
that had sent to me I asked them what I
could do like like how did you use the
products I coulda sworn they said to use
a baby facial one or two days a week but
it was not a good idea
artsy birdie says patent your product I
should it's just all about the time to
do it and I need to I need to I need to
figure all that stuff out all that stuff
is so complicated it really is and
making sure you do everything right it's
a lot of work it's a full-time job in
that you know oh my gosh Jennifer said
puffins wife said the same thing about
her drunk elephant eye cream she's got
little bumps bad Oh No yeah are ones
talking about she'd rather get Botox and
pills instead of the expensive skincare
yeah I don't know man I don't know I
don't know high summer summer says and
don't jump into using acid several times
a week say with retinol yeah and that's
what they did and I totally messed up I
totally messed up Michelle wants to know
if I like sugar pill I haven't tried a
lot of sugar pill I hide some of their
lashes they were nice that's it yeah la
looks baby facial take that one slow as
25% acids yes five to eight minutes at
first yes that's what I did I did five
minutes
yeah oh no you know what I did do the 20
minutes yup it said 20 minutes and I
left it on for 20 minutes I did I sure
did and I should not have but now my
skin is it's getting better it's getting
better I don't see that texture anymore
I swear that belief aqua balm is magical
that was I mean that's why I'm not
reviewing it right now is because I I
have no business review
right now yeah Dahlia hi Dahlia she says
Jen you're awesome I'm sure you're gonna
be well-rested and come back with so
many good ideas and more amazing videos

never heard youtubers talking about a
favorite brand I used to have a Korean
Beauty series called what the K that I
discontinued there's a lot of
information on Korean beauty brands in
there that series was a little flawed in
that it was supposed to be something
fastclick easy but I was only trying the
products it was very much a first
impression series which isn't my
favorite and so so everything is really
based on first impressions so but yeah
there still is some good information
over there though on those if you look
look up what the K on my channel you
should find it but yeah lots of really
good stuff from there from from K beauty

Michael thanks thank God for the soft
land because I was not in the subculture
a prism from ABH yeah and I didn't get
the soft glam and then I people were
saying that the soft land looked like
the nudie patootie I was like man am I
gonna have to get the softly I'm now so
thank you compared to the new deity
patootie but I looked at it online and
it doesn't seem to be similar really and
truly I don't wants to know how my
university experience was it was
interesting I went to university as a 20
year old I think I was almost 21 when I
went to college I'm pretty sure and so I
was a little bit older when I started
and I always lived off campus so that
was really different
most of my social life was through
waiting tables I worked for Outback
Steakhouse my whole college career and
and I lived as a server man we lived the
server life we went to bed at 4:00 we
woke up at 11:00
we worked 12-hour shifts and we we
partied man we party good with it with
the drinking at the bar till all hours
of the night you know it was we
definitely had some experiences you know
skinny-dipping in the pool you know like
not me but my friends I was always on
the outside fully clothed but my friends
especially the guys they were very much
into skinny-dipping in pools it's very
odd group of friends but they were fun
but I didn't do it I promise you I did
not do it there is no I was not me but
my friends did but I did I did rip my
jeans going out of a pool because we
they they decided they weren't they were
going to break the law and go into a
pool we weren't supposed to be in it was
like a friends of friends apartments
pool but he wasn't home so like we knew
like that that pool but we weren't
really supposed to be there so they had
barbed wire over the top of the fence so
in order to get in you had to climb over
the barbed wire and I ripped a big hole
in my jeans on the barbed wire getting
in and out that was a crazy night I have
lots of crazy stories like that from
college man we were crazy we did some
crazy stuff we had fun though really
really glad we didn't have phones back
then like camera phones the internet
stuff really happy because it was crazy

too chatty to be a bartender little too
unfocused oh it's not a good bartender I

good server but I was not a not a good
bartender so yeah yeah I was we had some
crazy times in college college was crazy

Monica I just my first I rip my jeans
store it was in second grade what's
unfortunate okay Holly wants to know
more information on a physician's
formula butter palette you know what I
know I know you know I didn't everything
I know is was in that that make a minute
I don't know anything beyond that sorry
it's all I know about it I don't own it
they they smell like suntan lotion to me
I can tell you I don't like the Sun of
the butter bronzers that much they're
okay but it's not my favorite I know a
lot of people love it and that's why
they made it into that little fragrance
esterline I was crazy in college can't
be anymore I'm a middle school special
ed teacher I got to calm it down kind of
calm it down Callum says have you ever
had any videos you monetize I know a lot
of small youtube will struggle with that
often you see worse than it is now I
knock on wood I
had a video demonetised in a really long
time so it's been it's been a while I
have a whole video on it
from when it was really bad closer to
the beginning of the year it was really
really bad so but yeah it's been really
good for a while for me I think they're
more hitting I like I know Phil DeFranco
still getting hit a lot of the news
channels and stuff are still getting hit
a lot I know Kendall Rae who does like
true crime stuff I know she still gets
hit a lot but the beauty videos like I
haven't I haven't gotten hit in a while
but I was getting videos you - I was
like every video was getting commoditize
for awhile like literally all of my
videos but then it would go under a
review process and like a day later it
would come back so but yeah it hasn't
been bad lately at all it's been fine
alright it is one hour in so Leanna want
to know what will make you get to
monetize when they have a video that
looks like it is breaking YouTube's
Terms of Service and I go really deep
into it into that video and that video
is a much better resource than what I
would be able to tell you now quickly so
Sara says are you still nervous about
doing meetups yes yes very much so
very much so I would love to do a more
organized meet up kind of like tailored
in with project Beauty share but I don't
think I'm I have the numbers for
something like that yet I think that
once I have my numbers are bigger then
companies like Sephora you know other
you know retailers might be more willing
to have me have like more formal meetups
but I think at my numbers I don't know
if that would be enough for people to
want to do something like that more
formally I think that would be the only
way I would feel comfortable with it
instead of doing like the informal ones
where I was like hey I'm gonna be here
meet me here and then creeper you know
breaks into my car and steals on my
stuff which is terrible because that did
happen it was awful but I don't know if
it was because of the meetup but I have
a feeling it might have been anyway
alright I'm gonna go ahead and pop off
here but thank you guys so much for
being here hopefully this was so fun
even though it was kind of all over the
place I hope you still had fun and mad
love to you I hope you have a wonderful
week we'll have a more
organized theme for chat next week and
if you're new to the channel and you're
not already subscribed thank you so much
for being here if you liked it you can
feel free to subscribe if you didn't
like it and maybe I'll see on the flip
side

another time and yeah now I'd love to
you guys hope you're doing well thanks
