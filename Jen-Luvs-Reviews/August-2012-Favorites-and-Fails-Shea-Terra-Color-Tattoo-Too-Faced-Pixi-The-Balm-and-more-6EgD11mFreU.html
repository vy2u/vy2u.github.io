you've been anxiously waiting for it's
my August favorites and fails video some
of you may think this is ridiculous some
of you may think that it's reasonable
but I have imposed myself a fifty dollar
a month beauty allowance for things that
I don't necessarily mean I just kind of
want so all makeup falls under that
category and for this month I didn't
count like hair lotion II kind of stuff
but i'm going to count it for next month
so you're going to see some of that
you're going to see some makeup you're
going to see
some tanning stuff that kind of stuff in
this video all that i bought in month
august when people make videos of things
that they've bought and they don't tell
me what they thought of it it's almost
useless to me like you make a video and
you show all the stuff you got but okay
fine you went shopping how does that
help me decided I was going to wait
until I tried everything to share
everything with you instead of doing
like a hall or something like that so
these are all tried tested for this
month I can kind of tell you about him
so here we go all right the first thing
I wanted to show you is I actually won a
giveaway on a channel and I'm going to
put the name of her channel somewhere
over here and I'm also going to put a
link down below her name is Bonnie check
out her channel she's got a beauty
channel she also does videos of when she
goes to like CVS or I'm not forget the
other stores that she goes to but how
people do couponing and then the end up
getting stuff for free like she'll give
you like the whole list of how to get
stuff for really super cheap using
points and different things so her
channel is really cool for people that
like to do that also she gets all those
beauty boxes and things so if you're
interested in those she has reviews of
those she also has makeup that she's
bought so definitely check out her
channel so anyway I want to give away on
her channel and this is what I got know
if you can see that it is the more body
butter and sugar rose tiger lily and
this is what it looked like on inside I
don't use it a whole lot yet but it
smells really really pretty and it's
exams it's exactly the way that it
sounds it smells rosy and sugary and I'm
very thankful for the giveaway and I
thank you Bonnie for doing that and it
use it a whole lot because I got
something else that I have been using at
this this is
the che tare organics bananas and bail
Babs whipped shea butter ultimate
moisturizing body cream this stuff
smells so good if you want to smell like
food like this is the way to do it it
makes you smell like banana cream pie my
husband this is the first I shot a video
from my husband in a really really long
time and he's taking pictures of me
shooting my video looking like a
complete moron so so you know it is what
it is but yeah anyway this makes you
smell like pie so if you want to smell
like pie you should tell me by this and
the texture of it is amazing it's just
really really really nice stuff and it's
97 99 point seven percent natural which
is awesome so yeah loving absolutely
loving that the other thing I got from
shea Tara which I didn't count these in
my fifty dollar beauty budget is
Moroccan argan oil and I got this huge
huge bottle not realizing how is
supposed to use it now it took me a
while to get used to using this when i
first started putting it on you'll
notice in one of my videos i forget
which one but my hair when i turn to the
side looks all greasy in the back and
it's because i used way too much of this
i swear my hair was clean and i used way
too much so what i figured out it comes
with like this little dropper and what i
figured out is it takes about eight
drops exactly on my hair and you can see
like the length of my hair to do it
correctly i was putting like 15 drops
and it like made my hair look gross
which brings me to another product that
i got i decided to buy this on the
recommendation of some other youtube
people the suave suave professionals dry
shampoo spray and i used this i tried to
use this after i used too much my argan
oil and it didn't help i also decided to
like let my hair
a little bit one day you know what I
mean to try it out and see if that
helped if it helps with like the actual
natural oils in my hair and I was a
little disappointed I guess it helped a
little bit made my hair's extra oily or
something I don't know but I wasn't that
impressed with this I'm gonna try this
kind next I love staying up next thing I
got was a refill I had to get more of my
tanning bed in a tube from Too Faced $22
so this took up a lot of my makeup
budget because this is now starting my
fifty dollars that i spent took up $22
of it which kind of sucked because i
ordered this before i started the budget
also i probably wouldn't have ordered
this i really like this stuff it does
leave a little bit of shimmer so i
always put it on before i go to bed so
that i'm not all shiny and crazy during
the day and it takes you have to keep
applying it at least every other day in
order to get with a darker tan i usually
only put on like twice a week so it
doesn't make me like super tan but but i
like it it gives you a nice color so
that's that the next thing i got was
something that I wanted to try and it is
the cover girl ed cream um I got this in
fair to light because that's what I
typically am in the wintertime is fair
to light so I got this one pretty much
for that and it really I don't know
anything about BB cream so the thing is
I've never used a high-end BB cream this
is the first BB cream on bought so I'm
not really comparing it to anything else
this may be the most ignorant review of
a BB cream ever because this is the only
one I've ever bought but tinted
moisturizer a kind of situation there it
has very little coverage i'll show you
the kind of coverage that it has so
that's
yeah I mean it blends out but it feels
very wet and lotioning and it blends in
but I mean like you can still see the
freckle on my hands definitely very very
low coverage so if you're looking for
something that's low coverage then this
is something that you might want to
invest in and it was pretty cheap I'll
put how much it cost yonder but natural
looking radiant sheer color which is
true all-day hydration not sure about
that natural-looking radiance probably
because it did make me quite shiny
improves skin elasticity don't know
about that SPF I'm assuming that's true
blends effortlessly that's true
lightweight yeah helps skin feel smooth
and covers covers to help instantly
improve skin's appearance and it won't
clog pores that's probably true I don't
have an acne problem anymore I'm 34 so I
don't really know about clogged pores
anymore ask me 10 years ago and I might
have known but I don't know anymore
that's one of the good things about
getting older you don't really get zits
anymore at least Idol next thing I got
that's enabling baby lips and I got it
in I don't even know what color this is
because it doesn't say oh yeah here it
is peach kiss and it is not pigmented
hardly at all I don't know if you'll be
able to see this but like you can't even
hardly see that it's there um the
tiniest tiniest tiniest little bit of
pigment you're probably not even be able
to tell on your lips that it's even
there I don't even see the point in the
pigment but I will say that I do like it
I love the smell it smells delicious so
you put the bananas on your hands and
the peach on your lips and you're going
to smell like a fruit salad may be good
to go but yeah it smells really good and
makes my lips nice and moist um my
daughter loves it my four-year-old asks
for this we put on her lips every
morning as I'm walking out the door for
work she wants this on her lips oh I've
been down and put it on our little blue
lips and she loves it so I should
probably get her road but yeah recommend
that that one's a good one I broke down
and got a color tattoo I got it in the
color that I thought I would use the
most which is
the toughest hôpital topi to talk tough
is talk and there it is i would say it's
more gray than taupe I like it I
definitely want to get more of these but
I'm hoping that they will get some
lighter colors because even this one
which I'll swatch for you when I put
that on my lid it gives me a really dark
look believe it or not if you watched my
natural eye tutorial thing that I did I
talked about starting off your lid
really light so that you have a place to
go now this starts off your lid very
dark I'll kind of show you how it blends
so if I can find a spot so when it
blends out you end up with something
like that and it ends up giving you kind
of a dark look and I was surprised so
this this will be good for like a night
time I were to work and I felt like I
was kind of over made up for work I
didn't really like that day so I'm going
to save this for date night instead of
wearing it to work so well yeah i
definitely recommend it on my makeup
state on really nice it was really
pretty it did increase i loved it so
i've heard that there are some colors
that just came out for fall that are
lighter colors and i have not been able
to find them i have looked at walmart i
looked at target I've looked at
walgreens I've looked a trade i have not
looked at CVS yet that's my next stop
but i have not been able to find the new
colors anywhere i'm getting a little
impatient right the next thing I got um
I got this which didn't end up coming
out of and make a budget because
hautelook paid for it for me because it
came with a broken shadow I did do a
full review on just this product i will
put a link below to that so you can
check that out this was the pixi palette
that i got from hautelook and it was in
soft fresh fresh focus palette is what
that is and i did a whole review on that
so you can watch that to tell they'll
tell you why i thought this pretty much
sucked so but yeah watch the video to
find more information about that i'm not
gonna working myself alright the next
thing I got from hautelook I got this
and I came broken and I think about it
and then that came broken so was the new
tooth palette from the bowl the palm
this I did not think was the bomb
I will do a full review on this if you
like let you know if you want me to do
that but in the comments and I will do a
full review on it but I was a little
disappointed in this I do like the
shadows I just don't really like the
variation as much but I can go into that
more if you want me to a 202 last things
that I got I was feeling very brown one
day like I just wanted like things that
were dark brown I don't know and I
accidentally dropped my dark brown
liquid eyeliner that I had thought that
I think was elf like the black hole of
my bathroom where if you drop anything
down there it's like gone forever so I
actually dropped it down there so by
lost hunt my brown eyeliner so I ended
up getting this next one and this one is
in extreme coffee I got this and I'll
show you how that school cheese 3 and
this is really nice I've used that quite
a few times it does have a little bit of
a shimmer it's almost like a bronzy
glittery kind of not glittery but bronzy
metallicy kind of brown so I'm really
enjoying that especially as fall is
approaching i'm sure i'll be using that
a lot and also i got my first full size
OPI nail color right here i'm starting
to get into nail stuff and this one is
called Suzy loves cowboy so good for
Susie and I did like this nail polish I
took off my nail polish that I had on
and just painted 11 nail with the color
so you see what it was it did take me
three coats to get it completely opaque
so just so you know it takes a hot
minute to get the stuff to really give
you full color on it but I liked it so
that is all that I got in this month
I'll let you know a little bit what's
coming up next month I used my twenty
dollars worth of credit at hautelook to
get a couple things from stila so i'm
going to be reviewing those in my next
month's favorites and fails also I got a
I start a subscription for glam bag and
also for a beauty box five i think is
what's called me so i'll be showing you
those at the end of the month so that i
can tell you what i thought of the
things in them instead of doing like the
box opening thing like a lot of people
do i'm not going to do that to each
their own I'm just going to do mine a
different way so um so yeah so that's
going to be coming up so I've already
spent well because of my two credits
only spent like a dollar on the stuff
from stila which yeah um and then that
was including shipping and then the the
two subscriptions I think those were ten
dollars each so I still have like 30
bucks left to spend well I thought about
getting the better than false lashes by
Too Faced I was in all to the other day
and I had it in my hand and I thought
about it but I knew that was my whole 30
bucks for the whole month so I didn't
get it um I'll probably end up getting
that next month in my budget so I'm not
really sure what else I'm gonna get with
my thirty dollars maybe another color
tattoo if I can find it not sure what
else that is it for my favorites and
fails of August 2012 so thank you so
much for watching mad love and I will
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
