been a long day sun's about to go down I
gotta shoot this video before the Sun
Goes Down so I'm hurrying up got the
kids dinner and now they're in there
they're eating dinner and I'm listening
for this dream in just in case but I
really wanted to open up my box e-tron
for you it does come in this box for
shipping but it's really hard to open so
I open it first and I'm just going to
show you this foxy Trump is a monthly
subscription service I think it costs 21
dollars per month and it is a mostly
drugstore subscription service now
they've been talking about doing the
full size drugstore products and then
some sample size high-end products so
I'm really anxious to see what boxy
charm has sent me this month now boxy
charm does send me complimentary boxes
but I promise you I will be one hundred
percent honest regardless last month I
was happy with my boxy charm the blush
from the box charm last night was the UM
Project Runway by L'Oreal blush is
amazing that was my favorite thing in
there it was awesome I'm ready to open
this I want to see what's in this I
can't wait so no no I open my box it
Sean if that cards in here I don't
usually read the cards it says welcome
this one says back to school impacts his
style now last time i did get a broken
shadow that was replaced by boxy charm
so they put this in the top i guess
because they want to make sure
everything is protected by just an extra
layer of cushion and then that is how it
looks about the little box Trump sticker
I'm going to open this video I'm accept
who I already see good things I already
see the things okay first thing I'm
pulling out is this messy all-in-one
base multi treatment base coat and I'm
super excited about this I just started
playing with nail art and I'm not very
good at it this was a horrible squished
trying to do the back-to-school nails
that missjenfabulous did she is fabulous
I am not so fabulous so I'm not going to
do a close-up on those but i will link
her video down below to the how to do
pencil nails and notebook paper Dale's
on base multi treatment base coat by SC
I am so excited about this all right
next up revlon super lustrous lip gloss
I think I I having these I have one of
these at my friend Ava from Avis beauty
talk sent me something like a court no
she sent me a purple one it was a
lavender one of these and I am so I love
eggs i absolutely love it so I am
excited to try this one I'm just ripping
through it because I'm just too excited
this is in the shade pink pop which
sounds awesome BAM check that out your
let's wash wash it yeah whoa holy beje--
oly that is a pink pop no joke super
excited about that next up oh I don't
each I don't typically like these I
don't have high hopes for this one do
not have high hopes because I try these
before and it always comes out badly and
their Revlon eyeshadows I don't know if
you guys ever had a positive experience
with a single Revlon I shadow in your
life because I know I haven't but maybe
this one will be different will have a
positive attitude right this is Revlon
customized in a party pops I think I've
heard bad things about this one oh yeah
oh this is terrible Oh seriously I don't
know you know Revlon is like a multi
like a probably a billion-dollar company
when you talk about like the parent
company and all you think they'd be able
to put out a decent RI shadow ok so
those are the finger swatches and I will
swatch those on my hand for you
actually that's not too terrible maybe
no no the first initial swatch was super
powdery I don't know they might be
workable especially with the base it
looks like the purple and the green I
don't know if you can still see that the
purple and the green are probably gonna
stay the best but the rest kind of
blended away I'll update you this on
this with a base let's move on nails
they seem to be putting these in there a
lot these nail stickers so we're not in
a nail stickers you'll probably be
disappointed in this part because we've
been getting these a lot I've honestly
never tried the nail stickers ever I've
gotten so many of these and I've never
tried them because I'm scared but now
that I have some money many I really
need to just suck it up and try so these
are the Maybelline New York colors show
fashion print nail stickers in metal
prisms and they're pretty and it does
come with 18 stickers and nail file and
a cuticle stick I don't know do you guys
like nail stickers more full-size thing
so far and now oh I love these I haven't
bought these in a really long time
because I feel like they're kind of
overpriced but to get them in a box to
chop I'm very excited about these
they're the moisturizing makeup remover
pads and I used to buy these all the
time and I stopped because I like my
neutrogena ones and they're cheaper
because I get my costco so I get this
giant box for like super cheap so yeah
excited about these let's see this is a
vitamin stick I never know how to say
this word acai acai acai something like
that blueberry pomegranate flavored lip
balm sorry about the cars in the
background it's rush hour so if this is
a lip balm I'm always about new lip
balms actually I just bought a new
Burt's Bees one that I love in like a
grapefruit flavor who it's amazing
smells really nice very smooth ooh mmm I
like that it's a little oily for a lip
balm but good vitamin E SPF 20 nice
sweet last up we got a l'oreal nail
polish and this one is in club privia p
RI ve i believe is privy and it is
really super pretty
looks like it's pretty opaque and it
matches the bottle pretty well so I'm
very excited to try that overall I am
much happier with this boxy charm and I
was with the last one we got more
products really happy about the L'Oreal
nail polish really happy about the
Revlon lip gloss super happy about the
SE base coat really happy about the lip
balm really happy I'm not the eye makeup
remover I can do without these I never
would have bought these on my own but I
need a step out of my comfort zone and I
need to try it and not sure about these
yet I don't have high hopes so i will
put the full price of everything in the
box right there and you can decide for
yourself whether you feel like this is
worth a $21 subscription price i am very
thankful and happy to have this stuff
i'm happy to have the yellow worms the
worms I am I think this one is
definitely better than the last box i
think boxy charm is stepping up their
game they're listening to feedback and
they are definitely improving seven
full-size products in here that is a lot
of full-size products very very very
happy with it and if you are interested
