review of to of benefit products I have
the goof proof brow pencil and also the
Bravo conditioning primer these were
sent to me by benefit with no obligation
to review this is not a sponsored video
first thing you need to know is that
benefit does say that they are cruelty
free but places like cruelty free kitty
do not give them credit for being
cruelty free because they do sell in
China louis vuitton company that is
their parent company is not a
cruelty-free company so depending on
your level of cruelty free you may or
may not want to use these they are made
in the United States however which is a
plus for a lot of people the brow pencil
is not vegan
it contains beeswax as far as a value
this is a pretty good value brow pencils
are a terrible value overall the amount
of product in here is 0.28 grams which
leads to $85 and 71 cents per gram but
that is way better than the Tarte the
honest Asya Beverly Hills products much
much better it's even better than the
NYX micro brow as part as far as value
believe it or not the Tarte Amazonian
clay waterproof brow pencil is $700 per
gram of product insane right definitely
go with a brow powder if you want
something that's a better you because
brow pencils really are a horrible value
overall but this one in particular is
not that bad in comparison with some of
the other ones as far as ingredients at
the axial palmitate is an irritant to
some people and some of the dyes are not
lips safe so do not put this on your
lips this does come in six shades and
the shade they sent me is number four it
is a little bit light for my natural
hair color which is very very dark but I
do like it and I feel like I can get
away with it it does come with a spoolie
on the end that I really really like a
lot I love it when products come with a
spoolie and something I really love
about this particular product is the
angle on the tip it's very very nice
it's got the point on one side and
thicker on the other side so you're able
to really get in there and define your
brows faster than a typical pencil that
is just a fine point so I really like
that about this it's a very creamy
product but not so creamy that
makes you feel like it's heavy or thick
or sticky on your brows goes on very
very easily the lasting power is just as
it says it lasts all day long and
overall I really like this product a lot
moving on to the brow though the active
ingredient in this that's supposed to
help condition and lengthen and
strengthen your hair is actually keratin
I couldn't find any other products at
Sephora or Ulta on their websites that
use keratin in the brow products things
you need to be careful of in here are
denatured alcohol which can dry out the
skin phenoxyethanol benzyl alcohol and
sodium laureth sulfate which can all be
allergens or irritants to the skin so if
you have any kind of allergic reaction
to things like that please stay away
from this I definitely recommend doing a
patch test for this if you are concerned
about being allergic to it like I was
mentioning I couldn't find a lot of
products on the market that were similar
the jebal she is the one looks almost
exactly like this that one of course is
a much worse value than this but the G
mocchi I didn't see any good active
ingredients for strengthening your brows
like this has in it now going on to my
full review of it though I didn't see
any lengthening or strengthening or
thickening of my brows as I use this but
I did not use it religiously for a long
period of time I've been using it for
about a week and a half and haven't
noticed anything extra as far as the
conditioning of my brows I would imagine
it would take a lot longer for hair to
grow in in order to see effects but if
you have had good experiences with
keratin in the past I would definitely
recommend thinking about picking this up
my biggest complaint about this however
is that it the formula does sometimes
leave a little bit of a flakiness to the
brows sometimes they'll be little flakes
where you have to kind of take your
fingernail and kind of rub out a little
flake here and there is it a big note
for me no absolutely not it's very easy
problem to solve
there is nothing in here for me that
makes my brows stay in place it really
is just a conditioner I do like to use
it as a prep for my brow pencil I don't
think it's a hundred percent necessary
for me personally but if you again
really like keratin you think keratin is
something that's good for your hair
you've had great experiences this may be
something you want to pick up and try
out so I want to thank you so much for
watching this rapid
you I hope you enjoyed it if you did

you in a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
