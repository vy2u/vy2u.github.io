the brand new one a brand new but pretty
no jus vias place eyeliner set these are
currently sold out on the Julius Place
website but I have information directly
from Julius place that day will be
restocked in March or so I definitely
want to tell you about these and whether
they are worth your financial investment
you've never been to one of my reviews
before they are quite long because I
have lots of information to tell you and
everybody is different about what
information they want to know so down in
the description box below there are
clickable links so you can skip ahead to
different parts of the videos that you
may be more interested in so let's go
ahead and jump into what video with
these eyeliners and whether they are
worth your money so the way eyeliners
come as they come in this little plastic
tray with a dual sided brush one end is
more of a I don't know like a pointy tip
and then the other one is an angled tip
and they come in this box right here
they are cruelty free they are also
vegan they are distributed from New
Jersey in the United States if you do
buy these in New Jersey then you do have
to pay sales tax on them they're created
and formulated in the United States but
they are made in the PRC or the People's
Republic of China so if that bothers you
then just so you know these are made in
China there is some confusion as to
whether something that's made in China
can be cruelty free and it can be
cruelty free I will link information in
the description box more about that but
basically as long as you don't sell the
products in China they can be cruelty
free according to the Zhu Diaz place
website they do ship worldwide they do
have a statement about where you can
purchase them it says our website is
currently the main place for your
purchase however we do have some
authorized resellers which will be
listed shortly so I don't know when that
shortly will be for the set of eyeliners
you are paying $10.50 for two eyeliners
and a brush which is insanely cheap like
it's really inexpensive when I looked up
the price per gram of these we're
talking about 6 grams of Toad
products or 3 grams per jar and that
ends up being a dollar 75 per gram of
products let me give you a basis for
comparison the Bobby Brown gel eyeliner
is the exact same size and that is going
to be eight dollars and seventy six per
gram the tardis clay paint liner the one
that's in the tube you get twice as much
product as you get in one of these and
that's four dollars per gram of products
I was like well thinking to myself while
these are Sephora brand products what
about drugstore products so the
maybelline eye studio lasting drama gel
eye liner you get a little more product
at three point 11 grams and they're two
dollars and eighty eight cents per gram
so that's still more expensive the NYX
Cosmetics gel eyeliner and smudger you
get a little less product two point
eight three grams and that's going to be
three dollars and 18 cents per gram of
product the L'Oreal infallible gel
lacquer liner 24 hour to 0.28 grams four
dollars and forty cents program so of
all of those the julius place is the
least expensive per gram you're looking
at a drugstore a pot like this is going
to cost you eight to ten dollars you're
getting ten fifty you're getting two of
them and a brush so we cannot argue that
this is a fantastic deal if they are
good so at this point I'm going to show
you a quick demo of me applying these
liners I will tell you that the
eyeshadow I'm wearing today is the
saharan palette by julius place this
video is coming up next so if you want
to see the review of this and how I got
the eyeshadow look that I'm wearing
today definitely make sure you subscribe
so you don't miss that but right now I'm
just going to show you the application
of the brown eyeliner and then I'll show
you how I applied the black liners you
can see how they both work
you
and
I hope you enjoyed that little tiny demo
there for you as you can see I really
don't like this brush I'm just going to
review that very quickly I don't like it
at all I find both sides to be too sick
too difficult to use if you're going to
do a wing if you're going to do a
standard relatively thick line on your
lid you're going to be fine
but I personally prefer the other brush
that I use which is actually by elf this
is the new elf eyeliner brush and I
really like this a lot so definitely get
one of these instead something that's a
lot thinner because it is a very creamy
product you really need to have a fine
point and I thought this brush is just
not a good one I don't think I'll be
using this brush anymore so before I get
into my full review I do want to do a
quick ingredient analysis on these
products that's when I look and see on
Environmental Working Group org and
other websites that I trust about the
ingredients inside and whether any of
them may be harmful or irritating to you
if you have sensitive eyes if you're
concerned about the environment things
like that the first ingredient in here
that comes up as a red flag on
Environmental Working Group is cyclo
pencil siloxane it's a three on
Environmental Working Group and it is a
skin conditioning agent environmental
working group called a silicon-based
cyclic compound it may be associated
with environmental toxicity so I went to
the website truth and Ageing which is a
really good website and it says while
silicones such as cyclo penta siloxane
do not appear to have adverse effects on
the human body there may be concerns
regarding harmful effects it may have on
the environment especially marine life
so if you are concerned about the
environment I would recommend that you
wipe off this product and then throw the
wiping thing into the trashcan rather
than cleaning it off with a something
that you're going to rinse down the sink
the next ingredient is something that
I've talked about before it's called
tocopherol acetate it's a three on
Environmental Working Group it is a form
of vitamin E some people can be allergic
to it is what it comes down to there is
a contamination concern about it I've
done some research on that it's not a
concern to me personally but if it may
be concern to you I will link some
information down below about that the
next one is something called
phenoxyethanol and that's an agree
talk about all the time because it's in
a lot of eye shadows also can be
irritated as some people links down
below about that so those are basically
the only ingredients in this that I have
any problems with at all my two
recommendations for this is wipe it off
rather than rinse it off and then if you
have very sensitive eyes and you've had
allergic reactions to those two
ingredients before you may want to pass
on them one thing I found very very
interesting last point about the
ingredients is that a lot of the
ingredients in here are typical liquid
lipstick ingredients which I thought
very very fascinating I just figured I'd
share that fun back with you so now on
to my full review of these products
let's start with the brown the brown you
may notice is kind of light it's if you
have very deep skin you may find this to
be even lighter than your skin tone
which you may or may not not like it's
up to your personal preference but just
know it is kind of a lighter brown but
because of that it's very contrasting to
the black as far as the comparison from
my personal point of view of other
eyeliners that are similar to this that
I've tried I do like them just as much
as the Bobbi Brown ones the tardis clay
paint liner I think I might like that
one just a little bit better but I find
that one to be a little bit more smudgy
but I find it a little easier to work
with and a little bit more black for the
black I haven't tried the Maybelline I
have tried the NYX I found that these
set better than the NYX that's just my
personal opinion so my biggest complaint
about this is just the brush kind of
stuff but because they're so cheap it
doesn't even matter it really doesn't
matter because they're just such good
products the packaging is wonderful it's
a very high quality packaging I mean it
reminds me of the Bobbi Brown packaging
as far as the class and the design and
the tab and I mean it's just a really
nice packaging I did wear both of these
all day and I did find them to have very
good lasting power and they did not
smudge on me at all
they do smudge if you want them to
smudge before they set and you want to
like kind of take a brush in make it
that smudgy smoky look you can do that
but once it sets it sets and it's good
to go
who are these products good for they're
for people that like gel eye
I feel like pan Liners are the easiest
ones to work with in my opinion but some
people prefer to use a brush and if you
do and you can get a nice sharp brush in
these I think you'll really really like
them a lot they could charge twice as
much easily for these liners easily but
they're not and I think that speaks a
lot to Julius place to create a product
no you can charge more for it and then
just not doing it and making it
affordable for a lot of people and I
think that's amazing
I have had nothing but positive
experiences of Judy's place I know some
people have some issues with them for
personal reasons or shipping reasons or
customer service reasons I have never
had that experience personally so I
can't speak to that you can find videos
where people have not been happy with
them but I have had absolutely no
problems with them at all again
currently they are not available on the
GPS place website but they should be
back in March so make sure you keep your
eye out for them then so I want to thank
you so much for watching this video I
