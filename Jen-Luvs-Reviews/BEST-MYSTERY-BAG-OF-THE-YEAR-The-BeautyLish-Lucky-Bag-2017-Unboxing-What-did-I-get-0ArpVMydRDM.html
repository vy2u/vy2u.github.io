have gotten a real lucky one because
people get different ones yeah you don't
know I feel like there's more stuff in
here hello my friends welcome to my
beauty lish lucky bag unboxing this is a
different video on my channel this is
the third lucky bag that I've gotten and
every time I film it it's like impromptu
like there's no planning ahead today's
Saturday it's my editing of what's up
and makeup day so I have no makeup on
the kids are home so I last year I
involved the kids in unboxing the lucky
bag and they really really liked it so I
brought them back for this video so if
you've never met these guys before
what's your name young and what's your
name
I love and how are you John bye and how
are you Lyla eight alright so just to
show that I have not opened this there
you go there's the tape on the bottom
and we're going to open it and the kids
are going to help me pull products out
and watch your fingers this is very
exciting if you don't know what a lucky
bag is before we open it too much a
lucky bag is done every year on December
26 by beauty lish calm it's a mystery of
things that you can buy a beulah SHhhh
they sell a lot of high-end brands like
Charlotte Tilbury and what else a busy
art and just all kinds of really nice
stuff Wayne Goss and just lots of good
stuff so I get really excited to do this
if this box was the smaller version it
was 82 dollars the only people that were
able to get the XL the big version I
think was a hundred and fifty plus
shipping the only people that were
allowed to do that were people that had
spent over a thousand dollars a year on
Beauty lish that was not me so I was
only able to get these smaller box which
was 82 including shipping it was I think
75 plus seven dollars shipping so let's
go ahead and open up the lucky bag but
it's really a box and let's show the
inside wait wait wait wait wait
this is really full okay so hopefully
it's not full of a bunch of packaging oh
sorry Lila did just bonk you I'm sorry
so that's the way it looks at the inside
it is pretty isn't that Lila yeah okay
let's see what this little tag says it
just says lucky bags are Japanese New
Yor tradition that inspired us to create
our own and then it tells you a little
bit about the lucky bag
and you can sign up I believe for a
notification for next year's lucky bag
if you would like alright go ahead John
mommy's nervous mommy's very nervous
okay well let the youngest go first okay
what is that okay okay lettuce I'm back
why would you want to unwrap it yeah
okay let's see what it is I did see some
people on my facebook group unwrapping
there so I kind of know what could be in
here but I don't know what it is okay
you know what this is I think oh yeah I
did get it last year you're absolutely
right so there's a small version of the
Bioderma and I think this stuff goes bad
relatively quickly and I still have my
old one so I should probably get rid of
that one and just start using this one
so and then what's the other one so I'm
excited to get the Bioderma again what
is that it looks good well with the
Smith &amp;amp; quot nail polish whoo
I do like Smith and Colt I don't think
that they're worth the price point but I
do really like this I wish that it was a
different color I've got a million
Burgundy kinds of shades but I don't
have a burgundy smithing Colt so I am
excited to have this they do like Smith
and cold as a nail polish brand all
right now it's John's turn no that's why
I was trying to pick one out and John
gets to unwrap it
so John go ahead unwrap it I feel like
I've got a lot of stuff in here I might
have gotten a real lucky one because
people get different ones yeah you don't
know I feel like there's more stuff in
here like I might have gotten Oh actual
lucky one which I've never gotten before
they've always been kind of the typical
ones my stomach is like literally like
not literally but my stomach has tickles
in it but I've got butterflies in my
stomach not literally though
okay Charlotte Tilbury yes I don't know
when anything by Charlotte Tilbury can
you believe that Charlotte Tilbury what
is it a Norman Parkinson what is this oh
and then that were B or Bay or Bay I saw
pretty much everybody got this orb a
wave and shine spray isn't that fun
what is this bye Charlotte Tilbury oh my
goodness I'm like shaking because I'm so
excited about this oh my gosh I don't
own any of this oh look at that it's a
frame highlighter and bronzer I've heard
such good things you want to smell it
does it smell good yes it actually does
it smells like very floral and does very
nice so it's got a mirror and everything
in it I don't know which thing this is I
don't see it oh the oldest are bronze &amp;amp;
Glow I've heard great things about this
this is great so far all right so now
John is the pick one I really think I
might have gotten like a better one like
a bigger one and they just they don't
know that I'm a youtuber like they don't
know that I make Beauty videos it just
kind of goes into the mass and even if
they did know they don't don't do
anything special for people on YouTube
videos okay this is the brush I did see
this on someone else's it just says
powder on it I don't know what brand it
is the other person didn't know what
brand it was so I'll have to look that
up isn't John supposed to be unwrapping
yeah no I think but you picked it okay I
lost track I'm glad they remember very
well it's kind of soft it doesn't feel
particularly magical but doesn't feel
bad feel soft that's nice that looks
good what is the makeup uh to the air
Paris five palette hombres oh yeah I'm
sorry I don't speak French Paul Pierce
I'm gonna try my grandmother would not
be proud of me right now
she's french-canadian or she was French
Canadian and it looks like an eyeshadow
palette fulness I got to open this first
so it's an eyeshadow palette to neutral
eyeshadow palettes I don't know this
brand but it's got a really nice range
of colors in there very nice oh I love
it
love it if I don't think I can use this
I'll probably pass it on my mom cuz I
think my mom would really really like
this
okay one more big thing okay so so far
is this worth $80 no but I'm hoping that
this is going to push it over the edge
or that just packaging that's just
practicing that's it I did not get one
of the huge super lucky ones Oh big
bummer that's just packaging was there
was more than here I think I was so
excited and then the big crash and burn
okay so let's talk about this let's talk
about this let's talk about what just
happened here because now everything
just kind of went oh okay
$80 $80 okay this here is a beach spray
I don't really use beach spray I don't
want the wick it makes my hair feel this
is gonna be passed on Bioderma I've
tried before so Bioderma I love but this
doesn't have a high dollar value either
but he do love this okay the brush I
don't need could live without
I like Smith and Colt as a brands but
I've got a million of the shade so I'm
kind of excited about this what I have
purchased this absolutely not I would
have purchased a different shade from
Smith and Colt but I know that it's a
more expensive thing the eyeshadow
palette I'm gonna have to try it I'm
assuming this is a very high dollar
amount you guys know and I don't at this
point because I've put dollar amounts
down below but can I say I'm super
excited about it not right now but I
haven't tried it yet the only thing I'm
really really excited about is the
Charlotte Tilbury was it the blush was
it called something in Brighton I forget
the thank you for giving me hugs
Johnny's trying to make me feel better
the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow I'm very
excited about this and this is really
the only thing I'm very excited about
this is not worth eighty two dollars to
me so I am NOT excited about this look
back I was excited and now I'm not I
thought that whole thing was full of
something I know there's like three
things yeah why
two three four five six six things so is
six things one exciting thing so I am
happy to have it I probably wouldn't
have purchased this so it's kind of now
giving it to me because I wouldn't have
purchased it at full price because it's
kind of out of my price range but then
the $75 $82 thing apparently was in my
price range because I'm a makeup addict
and I'm a gambler so I mean the lucky
bag really is a gamble I can't hate on
people that I feel like God you know I
really would have loved you've got to
visit our palette I really would have
loved have gotten uh Natasha - no no
palette I would've loved that more than
I love this but you know that's the risk
you take that's the risk you take I got
a positive attitude I got some stuff to
try and I don't think I've got my 82
dollars value but I am happy that I did
it so when I thank you so much for
