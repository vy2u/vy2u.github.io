favorites video I know I'm a little
later than the typical youtuber but got
lost going on right now and I just can't
get out the videos as fast as I want to
but better late than never right so
let's go ahead I'm not even going to
take your time anymore because your time
is valuable and precious let's talk
about my favorite things that I tried in
2016 the way they decided to do this was
to pick one product per category we're
gonna get into the more like hair body
kinds of things first and then we'll get
into all the makeup products the first
thing that I have to share with you is
this shree hot they're moisturizing
shave oil I got this in a glossy box I
believe which I never unboxed very much
on the channel at the gaim box maybe one
because I overall did not enjoy glossy
box but I have to tell you I am very
thankful for glossy box to have had to
found this this is the best shaving
product I have ever used in my entire
life it is not super expensive and it
just it's smooth onto your legs you can
use it on wet legs or dry legs and then
you shave and it just feels good and
leaves your legs feeling hydrated and it
just I love it I do tend to wash it off
after I'm done if I'm using it dry I do
like to wash it off my legs so I feel
like it's got a little bit of lather to
it so I don't like to leave it on my
skin but oh my gosh so amazing
next up hair stuff the Moroccan oil
intense hydrating mask if I was not
using this my hair would look like straw
I do have color treated hair so it does
dry out this stuff is a miracle I am
Telling You it is so good I've tried so
many different hair masks most of them
do absolutely nothing for me but this
one is really nice because I have very
fine hair it doesn't weigh down my hair
and it just leaves my hair feeling
really really soft it comes in this tub
like these and then oh it's still wet in
there and you can see how much I've used
of it you don't even need a whole lot I
don't have a lot of hair so I don't use
a whole lot every single time but oh my
goodness totally gonna repurchase this
when this is gone for skincare I did do
a video for polished choice that was a
sponsored video but man did I fall in
love with her products oh my gosh this
is probably the only thing I have left
that I haven't completely used this is
the resist perfectly balanced foaming
cleanser but I will link the video down
below if you want to see the entire
regimen that they had sent me to try I'm
telling you I I stopped using it because
I ran out and I tried using other things
and I feel like there's a significant
difference in the amount of wrinkles
that my skin is showing like when I look
up in the mirror like I just feel like
there is a huge difference since I
stopped using it I'm probably gonna have
to break down and purchase the regimen
again because it's really good it's
really good but I always get you know
with subscription box and things I get
skincare to try so I hesitate to
purchase the skincare because I want to
try this skincare that I'm getting in
subscription boxes and stuff so I don't
know I might repurchase it I might not
but it was so good I'm so good
for hair something I don't think I've
ever talked about on the channel but
whenever you see curls like this on my
hair it's because of the beach waver I
actually have two of them I use the
smaller one today but I do have the
bigger one as well it's pretty stinking
awesome what it does is when you plug it
in you put your hair in the clip and
then you just plug it in for you real
quick hold on Wow
I did have to unplug one of my lights
real quick to show you this but this is
how it works you turn the button on
right here and then when you want to use
it you go like this mmm and it wraps
your hair up real nice or you can turn
it that way whichever way you like this
is not the professional version there is
a professional version but I don't own
that one it does have a temperature
gauge here and I did purchase this
actually I technically didn't purchase
this I got it off of Birchbox with
Birchbox points so I think I paid a very
small amount for it but I am not
sponsored by this brand this brand does
not know I exist but I do really really
really love these products so I just
wanted to let you know because it's
pretty stinking awesome I mean you think
your hair might get stuck in something
like this but it doesn't the only thing
I warn you about is while you're holding
it don't hit the home button because it
does move by you know like back around
to the home position if you accidentally
hit this while your hair still in it so
what I do if I get in that kind of
situation is I just let go with the curl
and my hair falls out and we're good but
Tony my curls last all day when I use
this thing it is the best curling iron
I've ever used
break through brush brand of the year
for me was motor brushes by royal and
langnickel oh my goodness I had a chance
to meet the people at royal and
langnickel at generation Beauty they did
give me some rushes to try but I am not
sponsored by them in any way but I am
Telling You this is the best brush brand
for the price point that I have ever
seen they are so good you can find them
at Walmart so if you see these like neon
brushes and you see some shapes that
look good to you I totally recommend
picking them up I have a bunch of them I
just brought out a couple of them here
this fan brush is a little bit thin I
don't quite like it as much as my $30
brush but if you think about the
difference between the price point it'll
do the job it's pretty awesome for the
price point I mean they've got thick
ones if I shadow ones they face ones I
mean like just amazing for the price
point they feel really good too they've
got I hate everyone says this but like
that NARS II kind of feel it's got that
rubberized grip on here which feels
really good and then the metal ferrule
and it's just mmm I love them I love
motor brushes there hasn't been one that
I have outright dislike there's ones
that I prefer more than others but none
that I just dislike they're all really
good
I didn't have any primers this year that
blew me away so let's go into Foundation
and my favorite breakthrough foundation
of the year was from ELF and this is the
moisturizing foundation stick if you can
get your hands on this thing girlfriend
a boyfriend you have to try it it is so
good it is better than hourglass one
better than the anasazi one I try both
of those I did not like them as much as
this my shade is natural which I don't
like that as an 8 as a shade name
because it's like well what are the
other shades then unnatural like it just
kind of irks me when they do skin color
shades as being natural I don't know
just a little nitpick there but the
formula it's so good it's like a medium
coverage but you can build it up to a
little more of a full coverage or you
can kind of put less on and have a
lighter coverage it's just a really
versatile product super easy to use
super easy to blend lasting powers
amazing yes on the elf moisturizing
foundation stick it's awesome for
concealer this is going to be one that
is not going to surprise anyone it's
pretty much everybody's favorite
concealer of the year and you know I
don't blow smoke again I'm not no one
knows none of these brands I'm gonna say
it one more time
none of these brands know that I'm
talking about them I'm not being paid
for any of this torque shape tape this
is the best concealer I have ever used
in my entire life and I like a lot of
concealers there's concealers don't have
to do like a whole lot for me to for
them to make me happy but oh my gosh
like the opacity of this is insane when
I use it all my under eyes I barely have
to use any product and it blends out
like a dream I usually what I do is I'll
start blending with a brush and then
I'll tap it into my skin with my fingers
to kind of finish it off but the opacity
is insane the lasting power is insane
doesn't crease on me it's just a
legitimately good product so good
I shadow primer if you've been watching
my channel for a while you'll probably
well know what this is the Ulta
eyeshadow primer this is in the shade
nude matte for me it is an exact dupe
for Urban Decay's eyeshadow primer
potion and Eden
it does have some pigment in it that
helps you to mute out discoloration on
your lid before starting your eyeshadow
look and it is just an amazing light
primer I have no complaints about it
makes my eyeshadow stay on longer
it doesn't crease at all it does
everything I want an eyeshadow primer to
do it's stinkin amazing I haven't tried
the other one there's one in champagne I
think is what it's called I haven't
tried that one I've only tried the new
map but oh my goodness so amazing for
brows another really surprising brow
product for me than I fell in love with
this is the Cabrillo by benefit I love
the packaging I love that it comes with
a little brush inside it's kind of like
if you've ever tried the honest Asya dip
brow and it was too intense for you you
may want to try the kabrel
it's like it's a gel kind of formula but
it's not as opaque so you can get a
really opaque look with it or you can
get something a lot more natural my
biggest complaint about this is the size
of it is really really small for the
price the value is just not good but it
takes me a while to go through a brow
product and like with my dip brow its
ride out before I could finish it anyway
so I'm not it's not a total deal-breaker
for me but I wish they were more there
was more product in here but man it's a
good product and it lasts on my eyebrows
all day like I just can't even imagine a
better brow product than this one it's
so good so good
I feel like 2017 is gonna have a hard
time keeping up with the products that
are my favorites this year like I can't
imagine anything better than some of
this stuff it's just legitimately very
good alright so let's talk about I
shadow favorite eyeshadow palette of the
years also one that I think that that is
not going to be a surprise the anasazi
on Modern Renaissance eyeshadow palette
this pretty much wins in every way it's
possible to win except for price point
price point it's really expensive per
gram of product but man is it a good I
shadow about it's so good
the shimmers are shimmery the mats are
madee they go together really well
the shade range is awesome you got lots
of choices in here like infinite number
of looks in here and that's hard to do
in an eyeshadow palette to really make
it so that you can have kind of an
infinite number of looks it's just a
solid good palette lasting power so good
and it's just oh I have not I have no
complaints about this except for the
price point sucks other than that I love
it
as far as price per gram and a brand
eyes shadow palette of the year I'm
gonna give that to this one this is the
masquerade palette by julius place i
have had so much fun with this palette
so much fun i've really enjoyed it a lot
the quality of this eyeshadow palette is
just really good the pans are ginormous
like I was saying of the botton modern
renaissance palette how the price
program is not good the price for gram
per gram for this is insanely cheap it's
just a really good quality eyeshadow
palette I am NOT reviewing the brands on
the whole I know there are lots of
people that have issues with this brand
but that is not what this video is about
this video is about the fact that the
qualities eyeshadows is on stinking
point I love the shade range of it I do
wish it was a little more light skin
tone friendly but I'm not gonna cry
about it because there's plenty of high
shadow palettes that are light skin
friendly so I can rage in those on the
nose I'm totally ok with that but there
isn't a shadow in here that I don't like
I love them all this one here has some
glitter fallout but that's the only one
that I have any complaints about I still
really like the shadow it's just that as
glitter fall out they're just they're
just awesome
quality this is really really good and I
love it going into cheeks we're gonna
talk about cheek palates the I think I
got the this year I'm pretty sure I
got this this year I'm hoping I got this
this year this is the honest Asya
contour kit I love this thing oh my gosh
I mostly stick to this shade here but I
love this shade so much because I feel
like it's the perfect contour for my
skintone I do really like the highlight
shades as well I don't use them as often
but this one is just so magical for me I
use it all the time I feel like I'm just
constantly reaching for this because
it's like old reliable you know I know
it's gonna work for me I know it's gonna
be easy to use I don't have to think and
it's just really good product lasting
powers fantastic on it I feel like the
Kat Von D shade light lasting power is
not as good as this one so that's why
this one would beat out that one but I'm
pretty sure I got that before this year
but yes definitely great on this contour
palette amazing for highlight palette
again another Anastasio palette the
honest hacia glow kit on Stassi and it's
so funny because I didn't even realize
how much I love honest Asya products and
so I started getting ready for this
video and I was like there's a lot on
estancia in here because I got a they
don't know me at all they have no idea
who I am at least I don't think they do
so this this highlighter palette was
just really fun to use after I purchased
it I've used it so much quality again
excellent it is one of those from space
kind of highlighter palettes if you
don't like a real poppy glow you're not
gonna like these glow kits but this one
I really loved by the way this one is in
the shade gleam there were quite a few
of these work that were released and
it's just the the shade range in here is
beautiful you can use it on lots of
different skin tones I mean you've got
this one that's like in like a duo
chrome here it's like a tan with some
pink shift in it and it's just fun
I've used these as eyeshadows they make
beautiful eyeshadows you get a ton of
product price per gram is amazing it's
just a hit out of the park it's amazing
I had to mention this one even though I
said that the Glo kit was my favorite
palette I had to mention a single
highlighter that I really liked and I
know a lot of people did not like this
product but I don't go by what other
people like I go by what I like and it's
cool if you don't like this product I'm
totally fine with that but I loved it
this is the Pat McGrath labs Feingold
0:03 pigment this is the gold
highlighter I had so much fun playing
with this this year I loved it as a
highlight I loved it as an eyeshadow I
just I had fun with it
I really did it's crazy from space and I
love it it's just beautiful it's got
this gorgeous gold shift in it I don't
own anything that compares even close to
this it's just beautiful it's a
beautiful product it's so fun lasting
power is pretty good it is a bit
obnoxiously expensive but I'm just
really thankful to have it I'd had a lot
of fun with it it's a good toy this is
like probably my favorite toy of the
year and now for blush of the year the
in stain blush in the shade a pinstripe
I just love these kinds of shades and
the in stain blushes are amazing they
last all day long on my cheeks they're
formula I don't know what they're doing
with this formula but it's like it's
like magic and they must sprinkle some
kind of fairy dust in here to make it
magical it just it lasts so long such a
good formula and it just the color is
beautiful gives you that nice like in
from the cold kind of flush very
versatile for many different skin tones
it looks like it's so deep that if
you're really really pale you might not
be able to pull it off but you can trust
me you can't just tap your brush in real
light fluff it on with a really fluffy
brush it'll look beautiful absolutely
beautiful it's just a gorgeous shade
it's a gorgeous formula and I it's
amazing
and now finally lipstick formula of the
year and this is the only lip product
I'm gonna mention because it is so far
above every other lip product that I
tried all year long this is the bare
minerals Jen nude liquid lipsticks I did
a whole video swatching the Jen new line
oh my goodness
adjust the best liquid lipstick formula
in my opinion of all time if you like
liquid lipsticks that dry down
completely there kiss proof they don't
go anywhere you will not like this
that's not me I don't mind if a lipstick
transfers I don't mind if it doesn't
last all day I want it to be comfortable
I want it to feel good I want it to be
beautiful shade that is exactly what
this is and it smells like chocolate
pudding like you just open up a snack
pack and put your nose in it and sniffed
it all up smell soap smells so good I
have probably three quarters if not more
of the line of these they're so good I
just love the way they look I love the
way they feel I love the way they smell
lasting power is not great on him though
I'll have to tell you last powers okay
they don't flake off really bad they
wear down very gracefully most of the
shades will right wear down very
gracefully they don't stain though you
just kind of have to like I'll take a
lip balm and I'll throw it over top as
it's fading and I'll totally even it out
really nicely so that it fades down a
little more graceful but and best liquid
lipstick formula oh my goodness so in
love I'm looking forward to seeing them
coming out with new shades I actually
got their holiday version of it it's on
sale at Sephora right now I believe it's
a red shade I'm really hoping in 2017
they release more shades that are not in
the nude family so that is it for my
2016 favorites video I hope you enjoyed
it if you did definitely make sure you
hit the subscribe button I am planning
on doing a 2016 fails video the worst
products that I tried this year but I
want to do a little more I want to spend
a little more time making sure that I'm
really showing you the worst of things

you in a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
