channels are you tired of seeing the
same people over and over again in your
feed I've got some new channels for you
and they were all under 5,000
subscribers and I'm not even kidding you
you would never know by the content they
create
hang tight we're getting into it right
now I'm having a bad hair day
don't judge me I don't know how you feel
but the way that I feel is that I feel
like YouTube constantly suggests the
same channels over and over and over
again for me to watch they're usually
the channels to have a ton of
subscribers and not to say they haven't
earned their place as the top Beauty
creators but I feel like they kind of
the way that YouTube works they kind of
drown out anybody else and I get
irritated that YouTube is not suggesting
different content for me to watch and
it's just the way that the algorithm
works you know we get tired of watching
the same things over and over again and
if YouTube isn't gonna help us then we
need to help each other I'm gonna talk a
little bit about how all of this came to
be if you want to get straight to the
channels there is a skip ahead time
stamp down in the video description to
skip straight to it something really big
happened made me want to make this video
just the way that I'm making it today
YouTube changed their partner
requirements back a long long time ago
when I had my old channel no one was
making money and when they first
introduced the program they only allowed
40 creators to join in the beginning I'm
gonna come back to that in just a minute
because there's somebody that I want to
mention having to do with that
so only 40 creators monetize their
channel in the beginning and then I
think it was in 2009 they allowed
everybody to monetize their videos which
means to be able to make money off of
the ads that run on videos the new
requirements are that you must have at
least 1,000 subscribers and 4000 hours
of watch time per year so right now it's
January of 2018 so between January 2018
and January of 2019
that's my window of time to get 4,000
hours you know let's say I you know I
don't make it in that period of time
then it goes February to February March
to March you know from day to day it
keeps going keeps flowing so as soon as
you get that
4,000 hours you're able to monetize
apply to monetize your channel because
then they'll look at your channels see
whether you have good family-friendly
content or not and then they'll decide
whether your channel will be monetized
so things have really changed they're
really pulling back on who can make
money off of videos I guess YouTube is
figuring out that these brand new
channels that are cropping up a lot of
them you know maybe putting out things
that they don't want to put ads in front
of and that's their way of controlling
new channels the big problem with this
is that the people that have been around
a really really long time are now losing
their monetization people that have
always had a really good content I've
always been family-friendly always put
out good stuff
they're now losing their ability to make
money and this is where I want to come
back to it an old friend of mine his
name is Terry he had a channel called
zip ster he was the according to him the
very first person they contacted in
order to monetize channels and I do
believe him I know he was part of that
first 40 I know I believe that they told
him that his channel is now being
demonetised because he doesn't meet that
threshold anymore which makes me so sad
that YouTube is stripping this from
creators that already exists especially
people that make content regularly you
do have to meet a one hundred dollar
threshold in order to gain any money but
the money that these people are making
it mean it does add up and they do end
up making that hundred dollars in
YouTube is basically taking that away
from these smaller creators which I
think personally is kind of messed up of
course we don't just make youtube videos
just to make money we should be making
YouTube videos because we enjoy the
platform because we enjoy making videos
and putting our thoughts out there into
the Internet's but the money sure does
help especially with smaller channels
because you're not getting PR you know
beauty channels you're not getting PR
you're not getting things sent to you so
you know in order to buy the camera
equipment and the lighting and the
products in order for your channel to
grow you need money to do that and that
little those the hundred dollars here
and there can really really help with
that what I decided to do was to go on
my Twitter when I found this out I
announced it I saw how many of my
Twitter followers do have those smaller
channels and I said hey if you do not
meet these requirements put your channel
down below I looked at I don't know 50
60 different videos
I looked at a lot of videos a lot of
channels and I hand-picked out ten of
those channels for you to recommend to
you today and I tried really to take my
emotions out of it just like the way
that I take my emotions out of my
reviews I tried to really pick the
channels that I felt like really are
doing amazing things on their Channel
and there's no reason why you shouldn't
be watching them so I had some criteria
this was what I put up as far as what I
was looking for in order to include in
this video camera presence engaging
gives valuable information if they're
showing off a product or doing the
tutorial we need to be able to see what
they're doing and see it clearly doesn't
mean they have to have an amazing camera
amazing lighting but we still need to be
able to see what they're doing this was
the one that I think knocked out a lot
of people was to be relatively
consistent my requirement for putting in
this video except for one person that
I'll get to in a bit was to put out at
least six videos in the past two months
people have full-time jobs and if you're
not getting paid to do YouTube it's
really hard to sometimes make time to
make videos so I figured one video three
videos in a month I felt like was a good
threshold for a channel that really
wanted to you know provide content and I
wouldn't just be setting you over there
to a dead Channel that's not gonna
upload I also look for channels that
were mostly Beauty content you know just
because this is a beauty channel and I
one thing I also want to want you to
remember is these are my personal
preferences so what I like to watch an
e-2 video may not be what you enjoy
watching so some people I may not have
included just because what they create
is just not my personal preference but
what I'm gonna invite people to do is if
you do have a beauty channel and you
want people to check out your beauty
Channel I want you to please leave your
channel down in the comments down below
no need to leave it more than once but
put it down in the comments below so
people can click on your channel
especially if you were not featured in
this video so here are the 10 channels
that I picked hopefully you will check
these out because honestly I really
really enjoy all these channels so here
we go hello editing Jen here I realized
as I was editing I forgot a very
important channel so I'm gonna throw
this one in first it's Jody from yodelin
Jodha I love her channel she is so
funny and so fun she's a Canadian so for
those of you that live in Canada and are
really interested in Canadian releases
and Canadian subscription boxes Jody is
definitely a great channel for you she
also does of course a lot of reviews of
products that we can find here in the
States as well so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you a clip of Jody real quick
before we get into the ten that I
actually film for this video because
there's no way I could leave Jody out of
this video I don't know how I missed her
in the top ten before I show you Jody
though I do want to let you know that I
did edit these videos down so you may
see some really weird cuts in the video
I put those they're not the video
creators so if you want to see the
entire video you can click the link in
the video description and you'll be able
to see it not chopped up alright let's
go ahead and get to the clip of Jody
these are the Rimmel Kate Mosse these
pallets so when they center here we do
get three shades we've got this nice
burgundy with a bit of sparkle to it
we've got this pink with a peachy kind
of shift and glitter in it and then
we've got this sort of more natural
dusty rose shape so here are the three
shades from top to bottom I've worn
these with several different foundations
from powder foundations to liquid
foundations medium light coverage all
the way up into a Kat Von D lock-it like
we're serious kabuki mask foundations
and they seem to work well with
everything
I watched like one or two videos on each
of these channels and that's how I
decided to include them in this video
these are not people well there's just
like one person in here that I know
personally but for the most part I don't
know these people personally I've just
watched a few of their videos and let's
talk about hot mess mama m.d. she does
this really cool series called dupe or
just a waste of money and she tries out
dupe pellets not counterfeit pallets but
Duty eyelets like from shop OSH and
things like that she does an application
on one side of the more expensive
version and then at the other side is
the less expensive expensive version and
she gives you her thoughts which i think
is awesome if you liked my shop hush
video that I did
you'll probably really really like her
channel she also does reviews and she
does subscription box openings
she's very detailed which I really like
I love people that are really detailed
that's my preference and she's got this
really fun spunky personality so go
ahead and check her out right now
everybody and welcome back to my channel
on today's video is another edition of
is it a dupe or just waste of money so
right here I'm gonna show you guys it
looks just like this and we'll side by
side it with the Tarte Pro palette look
at that that's pretty crazy right
channel number two is a channel called
Ches ways her name is Kara and she does
she's done a few lip swatch videos
recently she also is doing a project Pam
for 2018 she does empties videos hauls
things like that the one thing I really
liked about Kei Kara's videos okay Kara
about her videos is that when she talks
about the details of her review she
really tells you why like you can tell
she has really thought about this like
she's tested it she's really thought
about it and she's trying to give you
the best information she possibly can to
give you an idea of whether you want to
purchase something or not which I
personally really really love let's go
ahead and check out Kara right now
welcome back to my channel guys is Kara
here this video is going to be a quick
swatch video I have six of the
Maybelline one of these called the
maybelline superstay met inked lip
colors and I wanted to swatch them for
you so let's get into the swatches and
I'll be back to share my goals with you
in a second
now one thing I will say about these
maybelline super matte inks first of all
don't let the outside packaging for you
as you saw when i swatched them some
shades didn't look nothing like the
outside packaging like even with the lip
liner the longevity just wasn't there it
does come off as patchy so I really am
not a fan of that shade lover the rest
of them I really do like the shades I
love the applicator as you can see it's
one of those applicators that have the
zip so it actually holds the product and
you saw when I was doing my swatches
that didn't have to keep dipping my
dipping the applicator back into the
product the next one is one that I adore
Linda from glare fallout I've talked
about her channel before you may have
seen her little face popping up in a
video I had her actually popping out of
the screen at one point in one of my
videos but I love Linda Linda I've met a
couple of times in passing she lives
near me and we run into each other
different events she's actually friends
and friends of mine that we found out
way later we didn't even know but some
old friends of my husband's are friends
with her and everything that's pretty
cool but anyway I really do genuinely
love Linda's videos though she is so fun
and spunky like she's got this like edgy
rocker chick look that I really really
love she goes into value which I
personally appreciate a lot and her vini
opinions are very very thorough you can
tell that she's tested them as well kind
of like Kara I like because she's really
tested them she's really thought about
it and she really tries to show you how
the product works before she gives her
opinion so I really really like that a
lot
check out Linda right now hi guys if
you're new here my name is Linda and
today I want to talk to you about the
Kat Von D mini liquid lipsticks sets so
let's see if the value is worth it for
you guys her normal liquid lipsticks are
six milliliters each and these are $20
each the mini lipsticks are three
milliliters each and this set of eight
was $49 so doing some math the big
liquid lipsticks are three dollars and
33 cents per milliliter and the minis
are two dollars and four cents per
milliliter so you are actually saving
money with this kit and it does
make it a worthwhile value I'm gonna be
swatching all eight colors for you guys
so let's go and please say a prayer for
my lips because this is gonna suck a
little bit
and this channel is really cool this
this channels different than the other
channels in one way that I think is
really cool this is a personal beauty
lab she does reviews hauls subscription
boxes and she's starting to do these
really cool I don't know if it's new to
her channel I think it's new to her
channel though he's really cool close-up
videos of products with her review and
it's just beautifully filmed you can
really see what she's talking about she
does finger and brush swatches I'll show
you in just a second so she just did the
Pat McGrath mothership for decadence
palate where she did this like really
pretty close up and we there was a
channel I used to follow a really long
time ago that did something like this
with subscription boxes and it's really
cool to see this kind of format come
back and I just I really loved that
video it was so good so I'm gonna play
that for you right now this is the Pat
McGrath mothership for decadence palette
this is the one palette out of the
mothership series that is listed as
limited edition both on Sephora calm as
well as the Pat McGrath website my
swatch techniques involve prepping my
arm with Urban Decay's primer potion in
the original version i use a mac 242
brush or a Mac 239 brush I also color
switch between swatches so my brushes
are never damp this is the first room
the texture of these shadows is
different than the special shades in the
mothership one two and three palettes in
that these are more metallic rather than
jewel tones like in the mothership one
two and three palettes next channel is
sheila bair makeup she does have two
channels so if you're spanish-speaking
she does have a Spanish speaking channel
I'll link that one down below as well
that one is just sin sheila bair I'm
Cindy bear sheila bair and then Sheila
bear makeup is the english-speaking
channel I think the content is pretty
much the same it's just one's in English
and one's in Spanish she does mostly
reviews I'm gonna get into tutorial
channels in a bit but she does mostly
reviews one thing I really love about
her Channel and it's it kind of thinks
that this is an advantage for but but it
really is I mean her camera quality and
her lighting quality is it's really
really good like you can really see what
she's doing which is something I really
appreciate I really think the heard her
setup definitely looks better than mine
it looks really really good
and everything is just so crisp and
clear I'm gonna have to ask her what the
world camera equipment she's what kind
of lunch use they're some cuz it really
looks beautiful
but you can really see like she's oom
Zin so you can really see what she's
talking about
again very thorough very detailed and
just you know you can tell that she's
really thought about what she's doing
and that's just something I really
appreciate and the other thing too is
that she explains things really well so
when she was applying a product she's
explaining why she's doing what she's
doing she's explaining what how it's
going on and what what it's doing at
that moment that she likes or doesn't
like and I like that a lot so I'm gonna
play you a video of hers now and welcome
back to my channel so for today's video
I am going to be testing for you guys
this new Maybelline tattoo studio
eyebrow gel that can last up to two days
so when I saw that I was like I need to
try that because who doesn't like budge
proof Rabbid the name of the product and
in the front it shows the brows and it
does say up to two days on there which
is really what caught my eye once you
take out the product from the box this
is what it comes in this little two
right here it almost reminds me of like
a lipstick now just as reference or you
guys know I did go ahead and get the
color medium brown now you also go ahead
and get this tiny spoolie to go ahead
and blend out
and make sure you kind of disperse it
evenly in your browser arms your brow
now I also want to go ahead and show you
guys the applicator I feel like I'm not
sure what the applicator reminds me I'm
almost kind of like maybe like a
lipstick so it's a little bit
interesting I feel like it's almost a
little too big for the brow just because
it seems a little like bulky I feel like
you have to be really precise with brows
on it I don't know if this is gonna
actually do that well of a job
applicator ways but you guys will see in
a little bit okay I've got a couple of
channels that are definitely
entertainment you know I just I find
them to be so entertaining better off
red oh my gosh is so funny I like she
did an ugly sweater tutorial basically
the idea behind the tutorial was it was
opposed to kind of look like an ugly
sweater but it was just like a kind of
like a green and brown look and it was
just a green orange green orange green
brown cream brown I think it was just
really it was very well done and it was
also very funny she's just got a very
funny personality she does mostly
reviews and tutorials the other thing is
their editing is really good cuz you
know I like you know all the little
bells and whistles and things jumping up
and popping out and stuff like I love
that stuff so the fact that she does
that stuff I really appreciate and she's
just so much fun and I'm gonna show you
how fun
my sweater is jingling hi guys
welcome back in today's video I'm gonna
show you this really fun makeup look
that will go with your ugliest tackiest
most fun Christmas sweaters for all your
ugly tacky fun Christmas parties this
holiday season this is a party look
today so the colors are a little kook
that's okay so in with a small pencil
brush we're gonna grab that super bright
green color from the NYX palette and
we're gonna sort of kind of smoke out
that lower lash line what I'm trying to
do here because the undertones of the
green colors from the morphe palette are
blue i think i wanted to keep this green
so that it doesn't start shifting blue
because that's not the look we're going
for so I left a lot of this inner corner
untouched
do not worry we're gonna touch it we got
four left okay dot Lee Mama Beauty I
watched a video by her that I really
really liked a lot and it was a
comparison between the old comfort zone
palette by Wet n Wild and the new
comfort zone palette by Wet n Wild she
did such a good job on that video
talking about the differences between
the shades which shades were similar
which shades weren't and then you know
what she thought about whether if you
have the old ones you need the new one
things like that so I thought that was
really really good and very well
executed she she went into a lot of
detail about it you could really see
what she was doing you could tell she
knew what she was talking about and I
just appreciated that a lot so I'm going
to show you that right now hi everybody
its Amy and welcome to my channel and it
is Friday and it is $5 Friday we're
going to talk about the new comfort zone
palette we're gonna talk about all it
come for some palette and the new
comfort zone palette okay this is the
original what the original comfort zone
palette and this is the new one okay so
this is the only one that they redid
from the old packaging the obvious
difference is the number of shadows and
another obvious difference in this
palette is that this
in this in this newer palette you have
finally they finally included some matte
shades they have this shade at the top
and the shade at the bottom these are
both considered transition shades these
mats are good they're really good they
were sorely lacking in this original
palette but I will set tell you this the
formula appears to be the same when you
actually swatch it it feels the same it
looks the same I would say that these
shadows in the old palette are a little
softer
this is the one that breaks my role of
six videos within two months because
something happened between last week
when I put her name on the list and this
week where one of her videos has now
jumped to like three months ago and then
a video seems to have disappeared I
don't know what happened but she's so
good I'm gonna say it anyway her
tutorials are so good like and this is
the thing because you all know that you
know those really specific detailed
artsy makeup application skilled things
not my strength okay not my strength at
all but I felt like when I was watching
her tutorials I felt like this is
something I could do I don't feel like
that very often with a lot of tutorials
where I feel like that this is something
the way this person is doing it I think
I can do this myself and that's what I
really appreciated about her video she
also did a video that was really cool
the 21 classic lip colors it was 21 red
lipsticks and just it was such a good
video the way she compared the different
formulas she goes all the way from
drugstore all the way up to super super
high-end and just really did a nice job
oh did I even tell you what her channel
was yet oh my gosh her name is Cephas
corner I didn't tell you what the
channel name is because I was just so
excited about this channel Cephas corner
is the name of her channel I wanna show
it to you right now
hello my lovely viewer I am going to
create this olive-green look today with
to name and to hear options so stay
tuned and consider subscribing if you
are new to see first corner I am
starting off with Mac concealer and
character palette as my eye base today I
have been using their a mere oval
brushes lately and I love how soft and
effective they are I have also done my
brows off camera with Anasazi Beverly
Hills brow how I am taking the shade
fawn from the smoky neutral palette and
damping my brush with my pixie spray for
a foil type finish I am placing the
shade on the inner half of my lid this
is a cool tone frosty silver with a hint
of green and it will go perfectly with
the rest of the colors
let's be real okay all right that's the
name of the next channel let's be real
okay I don't know what is up with these
K I've got two K's in here I don't know
how that happened but K is so funny she
is like the epitome of the hilarious
millennial she's so funny
and she does mostly tutorials halls and
reviews she's hilarious and she's
adorable and that's really why I like
her videos she's just she makes me laugh
she makes me feel happy in my heart when
I watch your videos and I enjoy hearing
her opinion on stuff so I'm gonna show
you K right now mmm hey y'all I'm K and
I went to the drugstores
I have uninvited guests inhabiting my
face right now they are very unwelcome
and they need to go away so all the
stuff that I have today is new at the
drugstore and I wanted to share it with
y'all but this is the mega cushion
foundation from wet-and-wild
and this actually retails for $8.99 at
my Walgreens though they did have $1 off
coupon sitting right there so I was like
yes please so when you open it up you
get this little thing it's like they're
trying to be fancy I got the shade cream
ivory and this is a light to medium warm
the one thing that I noticed about this
and I don't know if they're going to
come out with more colors or not there
was only eight shades so that's a little
bit disappointing because you all know
there's more than eight shades out there
so hopefully this is a good match for me
we're gonna go try it out I feel like
I'm saying the same thing over Iran I'm
gonna show you this one right now right
now I don't know what else to say they
introduced a channel I have to get more
creative for the next one of these the
very last channel I want to share with
you is called the fashion book and she
does tutorials hauls and reviews and
this was the thing about this channel is
that I watched her mascara it was like
you're doing your mascara wrong
something like that video and I learned
things you know I was like oh okay well
that's really interesting and then I
watched a couple more of her videos and
I was like oh okay cool well yeah okay
we got alright you know I just
like I was saying that over and over
again like okay I guess you like it just
I felt very educational as far as the
tutorial some tutorials that I watch I
don't find them to be very educational
it's mostly like let me show you this
Bob Ross look that you'll never be able
to create but it's really fun to watch
it come together I didn't feel like that
about her channel I felt like she was
really trying to educate me and that she
was making that connection with me to
teach me something and I really like
that a lot so I'm gonna play her video
right now it's up and welcome back to my
channel if you're new here my name is
Kaley thank you so much for joining me
today I'm going to be talking to you all
about lashes today I'm gonna be showing
you how to apply mascara if it's
something new for you or if you're just
not that experienced with applying
mascara the proper way to apply mascara
to make your lashes look really long and
full and just be as beautiful as they
possibly can then I'm also going to be
showing you how to put on false lashes
I'll always start on one side and get
the lashes how you're wanting them to
look before you move to the middle and
then to the other side once that mascara
starts to dry on your lashes and then
you try to go back and mess with that
even more that's when it really starts
looking clumpy so just be careful of
that and then I switched the one over
and always lean your head back whenever
you're applying your mascara cuz that'll
keep the wand or your lashes from
touching your eyelid and ruining your
face makeup also you can do the back and
forth motion with the one vertical as
well on the inner corner sometimes this
is a little bit easier and then if you
get any fallout from the mascara on your
face just leave it until it dries and
then you can go back with a dry q-tip
and just wipe that product away one
thing I want to say before I go is if
you submitted your channel for me to
mention in this video and I did not
mention you it doesn't mean I don't love
you it doesn't mean I don't think you're
awesome I had to end the video somewhere
but I do plan on doing another one of
these videos again in the future because
I really had so much fun checking out
all of the channels it brought me back
to so I said on Twitter it brought me
back to the way YouTube used to be where
it was just somebody sitting in their
bedroom or you know at their vanity just
talking about makeup and it just it
really made me feel happy it's like this
is what YouTube used to be all about it
was
about productionvalue it was about just
somebody just enjoying makeup and
sharing their thoughts and feelings and
I just genuinely had fun I probably
spent about six hours watching all of
these videos so if you did share your
channel under my Twitter thank you so
much for doing that I really appreciate
it thank you for giving me an
opportunity to view your hard work and I
think you're awesome whether you're in
this video or not just putting yourself
out there on the internet to be judged
and critiqued is brave and awesome and
wonderful and thank you for doing that
and for wanting to bring good
information to people out there on the
Internet
all of these channels will be linked in
the description box below and again
please definitely make sure you leave
your YouTube channels if you have one
down in the comments down below or if
you have an Instagram feel free to leave
that as well I'll also you know if you
want to check out Instagram pages feel
free to throw this down there if you are
not a beauty channel please don't leave
your information down there because it's
not this is this is for beauty channels
so gaming channels things like that I'm
just not I'm just gonna kick them out
because that's not what this is about
if for some reason you're coming it's
marked as spam I will go through my spam
folder and I will make sure that their
beauty channels as long as their beauty
content I will be putting them unspell
if you do not create YouTube videos I
would love to know which channels you
are most excited about down in the
comments below do you think that you've
found some new favorites and also for
everybody please encourage other
creators to do this as well YouTube does
not help smaller creators to grow there
had a lot of times there is some big
event that helps people to their channel
to do really really well and it's very
hard to have those big events especially
with the beauty market being sober so
oversaturated so if you can encourage
people that have larger followings to do
the same thing I think that that would
be wonderful
so yeah this can be a tag video if we
want it to be if you're on Twitter and
this video is going to post to my
Twitter feel free to copy this video and
share it with them so that they can get
the idea and hopefully do the same thing
there's so much room out there for all
of us and beauty video creators to have
an audience there's such a huge Beauty
audience out there there's enough
viewers for everybody so let's just
share and have fun and enjoy the
platform again in 2018 I want to thank
you so much for watching this video I
hope you enjoyed it if for some reason
