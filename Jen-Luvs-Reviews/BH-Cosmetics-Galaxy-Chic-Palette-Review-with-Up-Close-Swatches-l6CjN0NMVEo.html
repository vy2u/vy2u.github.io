of this 18 color baked eyeshadow palette
by BH Cosmetics and it's called galaxy
chick or galaxy chic I think I'm gonna
call it galaxy chick because there's a
chick on the front I really really love
this palette so and I haven't seen any
reviews for it so I really wanted to do
a review for you and show you the
swatches of it basically has every
single stinkin color of the rainbow now
those of you that I'm watching my videos
for a while know how much I love this
feel it countless color pigments these
kind of remind me of those not in the
formulation at all but in the just the
marbling effect within them which is
really nice so I just want to swatch all
of them for you and I'm just going to go
ahead and insert that clip right now
you come from outer space No
we sprung up from the
lay down
face to face
is all real
and now
while you're breathing I won't
Oh
all right
let's roll
you're hot
and when
children dog there
we're tall
our heads are high
and I wanna
chives
not so far
are the same
and our hot
like a go
leaves are falling
we are stalling seasons come and go home
winters chill won't allow you to
lemonade
so overall I feel like this is a
fantastic value for $14 if you are a
lover of color to eyeshadows you do have
some new more neutral colors but nothing
that you can really make a full look out
of that is my only complaint I do wish
that they had maybe a just more of a
brown toned color that you maybe might
be able to turn into a neutral look if
you wanted to this one is definitely too
crazy to turn it into a neutral look
this one you can really work with but I
just feel like it's not a very versatile
palette in that way but if you really
want a rainbow this is your palette
girlfriend it is it is so so fun to play
with I mean and especially for $14 you
just can't go wrong so thank you so much
for watching if you enjoyed this video
make sure you give it a big ol thumbs up
and hit the subscribe button if you
enjoyed it your question for this video
is is this a palette that you would be
interested in getting does it look
appealing to you please be honest I did
not make this palette I will not take it
personally if you do not like it I do
not take it personal all right it's all
about honest here on this channel people
I give you my honest opinion I want your
honest opinion it's up to you it's all
that personal preference so thank you so
much for watching a mad love and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
