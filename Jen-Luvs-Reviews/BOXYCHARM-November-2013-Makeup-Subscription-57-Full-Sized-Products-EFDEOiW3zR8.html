bring you another box it Sean I love me
some boxy charm like I do get this as a
promo box but this is definitely
becoming one of my favorite
subscriptions I am finding things in
here that i am using daily and i'm
starting to really really love this boxy
charm introduced me to nail stickers
which I'm now addicted to okay and
products like this which is the project
runway l'oreal blush that i think is not
available anymore but i absolutely love
this blush I mean I use it all the time
amazing things that I never would have
bought so I'm very thankful to be
getting my boxy charm but it is 21
dollars per month and it is all
full-size drugstore products I'm not
saying that everything I loved
everything about to trouble you but I
have gotten some of my favorite products
the nail stickers that blush and a few
other things that have really resonated
with me as being absolutely wonderful so
I am so thankful to be getting a boxy
charm but I'm going to stop rambling and
I'm going to get right into the box
opening as you can see it's got this
cute little green bow this is the
November box it was shipped to me and
then something happened and it they
couldn't deliver it so I had to go pick
up from the post office and that took me
like a week so it is a little bit late
to be putting this up let me show you
what's inside the box each arm thing it
says fall glam and I'm not going to read
the whole thing that's here but it's
just a little thing a little hint about
what the products are inside it says
that there's a full-page ad and InStyle
magazine for boxy charm which is kind of
cool and a little add-on here for the
you be so I'm assuming we're going to be
getting this but I'm not going to look
anymore because something's going to
give me more hints this is what it looks
like inside just as pretty green paper
it's beautiful i love this hunter
grinning this time of year just a
gorgeous color oh wow okay so the first
thing I'm seeing is this large large
container here this is ever firm cherry
blossom Maureen Maureen de Moringa oil
Maureen got whale I don't know
nourishing body butter by organics
I have tried a couple of products from
organics and absolutely hey you do boom
but this oh wow that smells good oh my
goodness that smells amazing that's what
it looks like inside there's a little
whippy whip on the top show you what
that looks like so pretty let's put
someone I want to see what the stuff is
like reminds me of cool whip the
consistency greasy doesn't smell as good
on my hands as it did in them in the jar
oh and sad i really want to like that
feels greasy okay next up Oh be a
bombshell has jumped into boxy charm
cool this is an onyx eyeliner cool I've
gotten this before and I didn't like it
because it seeped into my fine lines on
my eyes so I'm not going well I'll open
it but i'm not going to swatch it okay
because i'm probably going to give this
away actually we'll do what we did in
the last video anybody that wants to
steal bombshell onyx eyeliner I've heard
it work for a lot of people did not work
on my wrinkly lids so if you are younger
than me you will probably like this
first person to comment that they want
this eyeliner down below it is yours you
can have it I will ship it to you okay
next up this is the UV product
moisturizing skin cream head to toe
hydration you put on dry skin or lips my
daughter has very very dry hands in the
wintertime so I will definitely be using
this on her or anytime we need to fix up
something that is too dry lips or hands
etc so way I have never heard of this
brand this is called Material Girl lip
gloss and it looks like it's just a like
a cream colored lip gloss is probably
pretty sheer putting it on who smells
amazing okay that's how it comes out
mmm tastes like straight sure super
super sweet taste like sugar really
really delicious delicious lip gloss oh
my goodness not sticky at all tad bit
Whaley but really really nice I actually
really like this I'm surprised how much
I like that never heard of this brand
material girl have you guys ever heard
of material girl I haven't oh oh
goodness ladies oh I'm happy about this
one I'm excited about this one it is a
spa ritual nail polish I just discovered
sparitual maybe it was inbox each arm
last time I'm not quite sure but I love
love love the other one of these that I
got where are you this was the other
sparitual nail polish that we got it is

them and that's what that is so oh I put
it right over that lip gloss yuck you hi
Lyla Milas donor pajamas we're having
pajama day you say hi so here is the
swatch of the blind date very very
pigmented and pretty way I'd like to
rate a
box is whether I would have purchased
the item or not whether I think that
it's a win or a fail and then I total
that up and then decide whether it would
be worth it so this I did not like at
all so this is going to go in the name
box nope this you be moisturizing skin
cream I probably would not have
purchased but we'll use it but I'm going
to put that in the nabe ox this be a
bombshell eyeliner i would not purchase
