times to last month when I got my back
to try my recorded the video and I could
not get the footage off my camera was
really really mad about that but I
wanted to show you what I got anyway and
also because I've had now a chance to
try these products i can give you kind
of a little mini review let's go ahead
and jump right into the review of the
boxy charm for September now the first
thing that we got was this I'm a
restorative mask by argan magic please
excuse the kids chatter in the
background this is real life people okay
usually use the macadamia that I really
really like a lot I don't feel like this
moisturised my hair quite as well but
I've only used it one time but I don't
know if I'm going to go out of my way to
purchase this again but it wasn't bad it
was fine if you're looking for a less
expensive version of the macadamia you
might want to try this and see if you
like it i don't know i mean one thing i
did like about this is that you are
supposed to towel dry your hair first
before you use this where the macadamia
doesn't say to do them and i think that
might have made a difference as far as
the potency of the product i did enjoy
it but i don't think it is phenomenal
next up we got this Revlon lip butter
and it is in the shade gumdrop and this
is a shade that I will never ever ever
wear on its own it is a lavender color
it is not super pigmented but you know
what this is nice for is it's nice to
top other lipsticks and make lip combos
if I want to cool up a warmer lipstick
this is really nice to go over top to
kind of alter the color a little bit so
I do really like this and i love this
formula the Revlon lip butters really
really nice formula we got a mix a trio
and I saw that some people got different
versions of this I got the one in ultra
chic and this one and this is what I
found with all NYX eyeshadow palettes is
there's hits and misses this one here is
a complete bust it is not pigmented it
does not blend well it sticks this one
here is gorgeous i love love love the
center color it's kind of an off well
let me tell you this first one is very
glittery this
no one has a little bit of a yellow tone
to it and this one is a pure white this
one was okay it did blend away a little
bit but this middle one is definitely a
win I will show you what that looks like
swatched on my hand oh I can't really
hold on rip them off oh okay wipe off
the lipstick first gen okay so let me
swatch that on my hands so you can see
the differences in the pigmentation and
how the central one is so much nicer
than the rest of them whenever you get
any mix of products for eyeshadow
definitely keep in mind that sometimes
there are misses along with the hits
that the sheer gloss by next I will
never use this ever so I'm going to put
this in my giveaway box for future on
the packaging is really cute with all of
this filigree and flowers I really like
that but this is just a product that I'm
just personally not interested in so I
have not tried this yet all right next
up we got this Essie nail polish and
this one is in in the Cabana the inbox
each of the month before we got a
l'oreal nail polish it looks very very
very similar and I have a lot of colors
that are this shade but unfortunately my
bottle leaked a little bit in my
giveaway box so i don't think i'm going
to be able to give this away for
giveaway because i think that the the
quality of it because it spilled a
little bit has been compromised unless
someone really wants it and I I don't
know what I'm going to do with this I
might keep it I might give it to a
friend just because I've so many shades
like this this is in the Cabana I've
heard wonderful things about the shade
but I have not tried it because I was
planning on giving it away to got the
Loreal one sweep sculpting blush
sculpting blush duo the packaging is
very very interesting you get the blush
and the and the bronzer it says blush
and sculpt and then underneath you get a
mirror and also a little brush the brush
is very very very rough but it does work
it's very neat how it works put it like
this and you put it into the product and
then you brush it this way so that you
get the blush and the sculpt at the same
time loranger is not super pigmented um
but it works it's fine i'm going to
really rub this so i can get a deep
swatch for you so you can see they're
not super pigmented but if you don't
like a real pigmented blush this might
be something you want to look for if
it's still available this one is in
front and brush this one is in blush
excellent okay the last thing we got in
the box was this little teeny tiny
cleanser and I'll put the name of it
what it was there i don't remember i had
it sitting here and I think my son
thought it was cute and took it
somewhere I don't know what happened to
it and I did use it today for the first
time and it had a very smooth feeling
when I put it on and I how to describe
it it was a very thick cleanser um but I
didn't definitely didn't dry out my skin
it didn't give me that mask face that I
sometimes get when I feel like my skin
has been over dried by a cleanser it did
not give me that feeling I feel like it
did a really nice job and it is
something i would consider purchasing
now on to this month i have not tried
this month yet and i'm really excited to
show it to you by the way I do get boxy
charm as a promo box something but I'm
always very very very honest in my
review of it it is 21 dollars a month it
is a subscription service so it is
mailed to your house every month i will
put more information on subscribing to
boxy charm and down below so this is
what we got and i am assuming this has
to do with breast cancer awareness month
ii and it says raise awareness in the
month of october boxy charm or donate
twenty-five percent of all proceeds to
the susan g komen for the Cure that is
really really cool and then there's
something about la la villain deodorant
with no aluminum interesting i wonder if
we got one of those in there okay so
let's go ahead and open it up it looks
really really pretty inside oh it's all
john honey no cheese no cheese okay so
i'm seeing some things in here i'm not
really sure about first thing I see is
lash card I have gotten lash cards
before this seems like there's a lot of
them there this is a huge pack of them
there's 28 of them in here it's supposed
to protect your eyelid from mistakes
with mascara now I don't really need
these this is what they look like I just
want to show you I'm gonna put these
back in and probably add them into
giveaways I don't think anybody would
really want these for a giveaway so i
don't know but i definitely will not be
using these at all and then now we have
lavell in under arm under I'm in foot
deodorant okay sure okay so you get
these little tiny packs one is afoot
dealer agreement and one is an underarm
deodorant cream okay got two of those
next up we got the itch so big mascara
and I did try
so let's go ahead and finish this boxy
charm on my goodness okay so the next
thing that I am seeing is intense shadow
blast primer and rich shadow by
covergirl really neat okay doe foot
applicator that is really neat does it
blend yeah blends oh I'm excited to try
that this one this color is there a
cover girl is not very good at marking
their colors it doesn't say what color
it is that really stinks covergirl if
you're watching this mark your colors on
your packaging Nick's I shadows so this
one is platinum pink it looks a little
powdery will see this is a maybe and
then this one is super creamy and it is
very soft I think this one's going to be
more of a win yes much better much
better hit on the super creamy miss on
the platinum pink spa ritual nail polish
I don't own anything by this company
this color is in tickled pink let's see
what that looks like that looks so so
stinking pretty it looks relatively
thick looks like maybe it'll be a to
coat maybe a 3 Pope polish got kind of a
pearlescent color inside holographic
almost kind of shine to it I'm really
excited to try this I will keep you
updated on that and then finally we have
the salon sally hansen insta gel strips
i have never tried this kind of sally
hansen strips i'm very excited to try
these thanks to boxy charm for sending
me nail stickers because i was scared to
buy them and then once i tried them
thanks to boxy charm now i absolutely
love them oh no you need the LED lamp
that really stings up to see how much
they cost i may or may not use these
okay oh my goodness you get this whole
little kit in here here are the actual
strips and then you get this here this
is the salon instant gel strips i guess
you put this over top and then you get
the file to file them off the little
directions
and then these are nail cleanser pads i
guess you use this before you put it on
but anyway so those are the two boxes
charms that i wanted to show you again
this one that i just showed you was
October's box the one that I should the
reviews for was September's box if this
is a subscription service that you would
be interested in joining I will go ahead
