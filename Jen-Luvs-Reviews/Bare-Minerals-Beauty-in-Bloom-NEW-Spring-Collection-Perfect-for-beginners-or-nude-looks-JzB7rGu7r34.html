their minerals beauty and bloom 7-piece
fresh face makeup collection I was so
excited to see this at Sephora it's
thirty-six dollars and I I needed to
beef up my bare minerals collection I
have quite a few of their loose shadows
but that's pretty much all I've ever
gotten from bareMinerals I think I have
lip gloss but I don't have a lot so it
was really excited to try some more
products from them so this is how it
comes with this sleeve and then it's got
this cute little box and when you open
it up this is what it looks like inside
you get a mirror and it says hello
gorgeous isn't that nice of them like
the you know any kind of little
affirmations is really nice he's
probably not personally going to keep
anything in this box but if you have a
smaller makeup collection this might be
a nice bump to keep your items in and
then every time you open it up to your
makeup it's like hello gorgeous hi so
let me show you what's inside you do get
a look card it is in two different
languages it looks like french and
english i am wearing this kit today i'll
tell you a little bit later what i'm
wearing where i am wearing this on my
eyes today this is the little tiny
little eye shadow duo isn't it cute and
it is in the colours amuse and passion
and it's just a cute little package i
mean i just love this with the little
snap closure so this would be good for
travel it's very hard plastic I probably
would put this in something protective
just to make sure it didn't shatter this
color to me is very very ordinary but
it's very nice it's very creamy and very
very pigmented I don't know if you can
catch the pigmentation I mean it is a
lighter color but the pigmentation in
the way it applies is just gorgeous I
love passion it is a true purple and
that's one thing with bare minerals that
I love is their Purple's really are true
Purple's notice a lot of times with
purple eye shadows that sometimes
they'll gray out on me and end up just
looking washed out like cool toned
purples this is a warmer tone purple
it's got a little bit of shimmer in
there like a
but it's not real super noticeable it's
very very finely milled gold shimmer in
there and it's just gorgeous to apply I
have that my crease today and I
absolutely love it really really really
enjoy the students is a small a smaller
size of their nude beach eyeshadow and I
actually already own this so this one's
going to be forgiven if one of you would
like this small little nude beach I
absolutely love this I'm going to swatch
mine that I have so that this one can
remain fresh and new I'll open it so you
can see I'm not going to take that off
okay so I'm going to go ahead and swatch
nude beach for you this is my full size
okay so there's the there's the finger
swatch and then we'll give you the hand
swatch here very very shimmery nude
color but beautiful there are some
peachy undertones to it it really truly
reminds me of like glittery sand on a
very white Beach it's just really pretty
definitely the peach undertones and the
shimmer just just absolutely gorgeous as
a base all over lid color I've been
really into the very light all over lid
color and then darkening the crease I
feel like that contrast is gorgeous and
this one definitely lends itself to that
kind of thing next up is the lip color
it's a moxie lip color and it's in speak
your mind and not adorable how tiny that
is so so cute did I seriously just ran
my finger into it I totally just ran my
finger nail into that I hate when I do
that do you ever do that like totally
just oh hi so swatch of that well that's
not good swatch here we go okay a very
very light creamy smell to it like
almost like a like a sweet smell to it
but it's a very light smell it's not a
strong heavily fragrance fragrance lip
product pretty moisturizing definitely
not drawing really nice formula there
I'm enjoying that this is another
marvelous marvelous Moxie lipgloss and
this one is in spark plug and there's
the swatch for that pigmented but not
overly pigmented very very glossy a
little bit sticky you know the smell
reminds me of it reminds me of like
those you know those little mint candies
that you get at baby showers that
they're like pastel colors and then
got the little sprinkles on the bot
that's exactly what this smells like it
so it's got a really really sweet smell
definitely stronger smell than the
lipstick and more min T with along with
the the sugar eNOS but very very nice
product here and definitely enjoying it
definitely not a liquid lipstick it is a
lip gloss next up is the press blush and
this one is in the one and it is I don't
know like a gold rose pink but but very
very light really pretty go ahead and do
a hand swatch super super pigmented just
a gorgeous coat this blush has a really
nice where time it had about an eight to
ten hour wear which is really really
nice for a blush I do have some that
lasts longer than this but this is
definitely an above average blush as far
as where time really enjoying this what
I love about this one is that it does
blend out really beautifully to a nice
natural flush the other blush that it
comes with is this mineral blush in Rose
radiance this one's actually a bit
lighter even than the last one okay so
there's that and then here is the hands
watch okay so this one's a little bit
more peachy and tone but again a really
gorgeous color okay so for your natural
cheek lovers this these both are going
to be gorgeous if you have my skin tone
now my skin tone is the only one that I
personally have experience with so I'm
not sure how these would look on other
skin tones I would imagine they wouldn't
show up quite as well on deeper skin
tones on lighter skin tones I think that
they would be gorgeous but I don't know
about those you probably would know
better than I do if you have a deeper
skin tone whether these would work for
you this one does have a little bit less
of a where time this one's more of a six
to eight hour wear for the mineral one
but both again very very nice blushes
and the last thing that it comes with is
this brush it does have a fluffiness to
it it is soft but it's definitely not my
ideal blush brush but it does work it's
also really nice for getting into the
cap of that mineral blush so that use
its small so when you're reaching in
when you've tapped your product into the
cap and you're reaching in to get blush
for your cheeks this fits very nicely
when you've got a big huge blush brush
that's not going to fit in there so it's
very nice for applique
is it my ideal brush no but it
definitely works very nicely especially
you don't have a huge collection the
eyeshadow brush is okay it is a bit
small for my taste it's more of a
detailing brush for me I really like
using this one for the purple to get it
all up into my crease but I do not enjoy
this for packing onto my lid I prefer a
bigger brush it maybe even just half a
size bigger than this for the the four
lid application but this really is a
good detailing brush but again if you
don't have a big makeup collection if
you're not dealing with a makeup junkie
this would be perfect for application of
either of the eyeshadows so overall
review of this kit I love it I
absolutely love it i think the products
in here are beautiful i love the
packaging of it this is just such a
beautiful beautiful image and it really
draws the person looking at it in at
least in my opinion here this floral
print made out of makeup it just it's
gorgeous feel like this is more for your
natural nude makeup lovers people that
don't like a huge pop of color it's good
for work looks just any kind of time
that you really want to go natural as I
mentioned I've got all the products on
today the lip colors the eye colors the
cheek colors I've got the the mineral
blush on today just it really really
nice nice package all around kit this
would be especially nice for someone
that's beginning and makeup and you
don't know what to get them this would
be perfect because they get a nice
variety of products that are natural is
it's not scary so i would highly
recommend this for people looking for
that type of product i hope you all
