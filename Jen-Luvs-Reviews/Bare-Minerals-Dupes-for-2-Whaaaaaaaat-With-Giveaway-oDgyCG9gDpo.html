you I am an eyeshadow junkie I love I
shadow I cannot get enough I shadow like
I just I crazy about eyeshadow so when
company called Madison Street beauty
contacted me and asked me to review
their products I was like yes i will
definitely review that I check out their
website and I saw that they had mineral
eye shadows on sale for two bucks apiece
I was like two bucks first of all the
first thing i thought i would be honest
with the first thing I thought was these
things are going to be horrible like
there's no way they could possibly sell
good mineral eyeshadow for two bucks
apiece i think the original price is
four dollars and then they're on sale
for two dollars right now so they
contacted me and my first thing I said
to them was just make sure you send me
your best stuff because I don't want to
trash your product because there's no
way there could be something good for
two dollars for middle or mineral
eyeshadow so I try the eyeshadows and
honestly they're a bunch of them that i
absolutely love like there are amazing
oh my goodness and then there are some
that are really good and there's some
that did not work for me so i want to go
through those she also sent me to
mineral blushes of theirs so i went on
the website and the first thing that I
noticed was they have a ridiculous
amount of colors like ridiculous I don't
even know how many if I can count how
many are figure out how many I'll put it
right here how many I should I different
eye shadow colors and different blush
colors they have I narrowed it down to
10 eyeshadows and two blushes and she
said you know she'd asked me to pick out
five and all the guy just can't pick out
five I you know pick from these 10 and
you know send me your favorites out of
these 10 and she ended up 70 all 10 so i
get to review all 10 for you and at the
end of this video i actually have a
giveaway for you so i'm going to put the
information for that down below i'll
also give you more information at the
end of the video let me get into the two
blushes i got two different ones i got
one called hydrangea and won't call
lotus i did like hydrangea better and i
think that was just because of my skin
tone and like any mineral products you
have to really make sure you tap off
your brush or else you're going to make
a mess so i will swatch that for you
this again is high
tringa this one really worked well for
my skin tone I did feel like I needed to
use a very fluffy brush because it is so
pigmented so what if you do decide to
get these blushes make sure you have a
nice fluffy brush for them because some
blushes like NARS or tart you need to
use a very dense brush like they go on
very lightly these are more like the
bomb or kat von d where you have to use
a fluffy brush so you don't overdo it
hey the other blush that I got is one
called Lotus and this one I think didn't
work as well for me because of my light
skin tone I think if you have medium to
dark skin tone this would be absolutely
gorgeous but you can see how dark that
is on my skin tone and again this is a
very heavy swatch you just really have
to use a light hand with it i will be
using both of these blushes but as you
can see lotus is more of a mat and then
the hydrangea is more of a I wouldn't
say it's not sparkling at all but it has
definitely has a little bit of shine to
it ok now moving on to the eyeshadows
I'm going to start with the two that
didn't work for me now this one's called
satin taupe so I had a really high hopes
for this one because did have the same
name as the mac one I just loved hope I
shadows they're just beautiful this one
I just could not get it to work I just
couldn't get it to blend with other
colors when I did try to get it to blend
it got a little muddy I me just because
it is a taupe but I don't really have
those kinds of problems with my other
tubes so I would not recommend this one
in particular I don't know unless your
eye shadow master and more skilled in
application the other one that I felt
was a little more difficult is one
called slate and it's a very very deep
gray the big thing about slate is it is
extremely extremely pigmented so I just
had trouble blending it once I got it
into my crease or my outer corner I got
it in there and I just I had to work it
and work it and work it in working I'm
actually wearing it in my outer corner
today but it just takes a lot of work to
blend it out if you're not very
experienced with makeup or if you don't
feel like messing with it don't get
slate either it is a very nice color if
you can really take the time to blend it
out hey the next to I wanted to show you
i got because i thought the colors were
extremely unique the first one is called
Atlantis and again I'll put the
description here it is so
cool looking I mean it looks like a
mermaid's tail is what it looks like
it's really neat and when you first
start to swatch it it looks like it's
going to be very opaque but then the
more you blend it the more it becomes
quite sheer so it does have that really
cool sparkle it works really nice with a
white base underneath it to kind of make
that color pop a little bit more but
still it does kind of sheer out so just
keep that in mind if you're going to get
this one if this is a color that looks
interesting to you it truly is a mermaid
blue it's a really cool looking color
but just know that it isn't as opaque as
it may seem in the pan all right next up
same situation with the color green tea
this one was really cool and it did look
nice with a white base but again it
shears out pretty easily so you just
have to either really pack it on I don't
own macs fix+ but that may help this
from what I've heard about Max fix+ so
you see how it's kind of sheer but it's
got a really cool look to it so if
you're into this kind of color on your
eye I would recommend it just know that
it is going to share out just like
Atlantis did those two are kind of hit
or miss depending on your personal
preferences stepping it up a bit further
I want to show you copper copper is
really cool I mean it is exactly what
you would think it is it is a
straight-up copper color my son tried to
pick up one of the mineral blushes and
open it before my husband just took them
shopping no no don't touch it no so
there is copper I mean just it's a true
copper color this one the only reason
why i downgraded it for me personally is
just because of the worth of it and for
my skin tone I don't feel like it works
great but if you are a warm skin tone if
you have a darker skin tone mmm yeah
mm-hmm I mean look how pigmented that is
and then if I try to blend it out you
see how it doesn't go away it's just
solid it is a solid awesome color all
right ladies I you know I love my purple
I just did my purple video of my
favorite purple products this one is
called purple tulip and this is what
that looks like in the pan and I will
swatch it is watching so there is the
swatch for purple tulip just a beautiful
under color the reason why I didn't
include this in my favorite promo
products is when you put this on your
eye it does give you that gray to purple
look so keep that in mind that you're
not going to get a true purple with this
but it is beautiful it blends nicely
it's a gorgeous color it's just not
doesn't stay true to that purple color
as you apply it how many times can I
repeat myself I don't even know okay now
on to the four that I absolutely loved
that I feel like our must-haves in my
collection I use them all the time and
I'm just in love with them the first one
is called chestnut and that's what I
have on my lids today oh oh so pretty
really nice for fall just a beautiful
kind of multicolored just beautiful
beautiful beautiful and it's got a
little sparkle to it so this is just not
I mean just just beautiful I don't even
know what to say other than I love this
color and I use it all the time and
especially when I'm wearing this shirt
or a short the similar color I just feel
like it goes with it so yeah love in
this one again it does not blend away it
does blend out a little bit but it does
not blend away that's one thing I can
definitely say about all of the shadow
well not all of them I can say about
most of these shadows except for
Atlantis and then the lime one they do
not blend away at all when you try to
blend them you know for the most part
they are really solid quality shadows
and i'm pretty sure on the website it
will tell you whether it is a more sheer
color or a more opaque color so i love
that they communicate that information
to you before you get them okay this was
one of the first ones that I tried and I
was like oh my goodness if they are all
like this I am going to be in heaven
this one is called London rain and it is
a light matte grey and I oh nothing like
this I own some shimmery light Gray's
but I don't own any light matte raised
so I was really excited to see this and
so excited that it worked so well I mean
just a gorgeous gorgeous this works for
all over the lid it can work if you have
like a dark gray in the corner and
you're trying to lighten it up a little
bit this is a wonderful way to do it
cats joined us hi cat but yet London
London ray
is just a beautiful beautiful beautiful
color I'm so scared she's gonna knock my
open shadow over so scared let's grab
that real quick all right ladies got two
more left to more that's for ladies I
got two more left for you and they are
my absolute favorites okay this one is
called Eclair and this to me is the
perfect transition color for the crease
it is a matte chocolate brown like milk
chocolate brown and it is just beautiful
and I cannot believe this thing's only
two dollars beautiful I have it in my
crease today you can't see it because I
covered it with other things but just
the way that it helped me to transition
my colors just gorgeous oh hmm I have no
complaints about this i don't even I
can't even speak when I talk about
eclair I can't in speak it's just hmm so
awesome so awesome so excited about this
shadow if I happen to run out of this
which mineral eye shadows last four
stinking ever if I ever run out of this
I will be repurchasing this because this
is not repurchasing because they sent it
to me but I will definitely purchase
another one of these and i would
recommend this to anybody i mean it's
just beautiful and this will work for
any skin tone you know if you are very
very dark-skinned this could be a
beautiful lid color for you but every
most people with with skin tones that
are you know light to medium this is a
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous crease
transition color just o loving it let it
love it love it and my absolute favorite
and i'm going to put this right next to
the Eclair because i've been using them
a lot together as kind of like the base
for my whole I shadow look so I'll put
this one on my lid I'll put that in my
priests and then I'll get rockin with
the rest and this one is called Posey I
mean seriously this is my now go to
inner corner highlight go to brow bone
color I mean just absolutely beautiful
when i'm using a palette i like to use
the whole palette i don't like to reach
for other things but if i'm using just
my single eyeshadows I can't bear but
not reach for Posey I mean it's just so
stinkin I hate to say it but perfect it
really is I mean just you can't really
it's hard to show this one just because
it matches my skin tone so well but if
you're used to using
you know the brow bone colors and things
like that you know that you want that to
be about your skin tone maybe a little
bit lighter than your skin tone just
transition so well let me um actually
you know what let me do a little
experiment here and show you what it
looks like blends it into eclair I'm
just going to blend that with my finger
a little bit I don't know if you can see
how beautiful that is but that is
something else and 42 thinkin dollars
wats and even for four dollars like I
would seriously i would pay ten dollars
definitely at least for this and for you
Claire like I mean these are worth to me
ten dollars piece amazing I do own quite
a few bareminerals loose powders that I
love I feel like the last four that I
showed you are in the same quality as my
bare mineral or shadows the other ones I
feel like they are really good I don't
feel like they're as good as my bare
minerals but they're really really
really good then of course I showed you
the ones that just didn't work for me so
