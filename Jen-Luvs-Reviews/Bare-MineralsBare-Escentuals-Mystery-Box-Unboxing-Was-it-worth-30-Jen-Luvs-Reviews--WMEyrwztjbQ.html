I just went downstairs after filming
what's the makeup and saw a package
outside and I figured this would be a
great opportunity for me to film an
unboxing of something this was a $30 mix
mystery box it was offered by bare
essentials accentual Sencha 'ls of bare
minerals whatever that company I talked
to some people on the wets of a makeup
app and they were saying that it was
really really good and people on
Instagram were saying that it's good and
people on periscope were saying that
it's good so I said okay I'm getting it
I'm definitely getting it so I have not
opened enough to see what it's in here
but we're gonna see it together whether
we think this is worth 30 dollars or not
and this will make me decide if I ever
see this again whether I would get this
again so the first thing in here is
actually seems really nice it's a bag
and I guess it's a makeup bag it says
bare essentials on it the zipper there
and open it up oh that's kind of cool
it's got a place for makeup brushes here
and then here it has these little
compartments to put things so that's
really cool and then or you could just
take them out and just use the big huge
space and it's got kind of a hardness on
the outside so that your makeup is
protected which i think is super super
super cool I will definitely be using
this I am super excited about it and
this is already for me at least eight or
nine dollars for me just in this so then
here is the very small I'm thinking
immediately it's like that so no small
order tornados but we'll see what this
is of the pack of makeup products so the
first thing is this is bare minerals pop
of passion lip oil balm and this I'm
assuming is a mini size yes look at
little baby it is it's very cute and
it's tiny and let's watch E it's very
balmy it's very shiny but it's pretty
opaque for a balm type formula that's
kind of
cool it's very break though it's not
really a code that I typically wear but
I will definitely keep it I'm sure that
it will get used next up is the
marvelous Moxie lipstick in raise the
bar and this looks like a nice fall
color where this one is kind of on I
feel like the season is kind of over for
that one save it for next season this
one seems like something that's more for
fall that's really pretty again a mini
sized and there is that there's
definitely a very me shade this will get
used and loved this will probably end up
like in my desk at work or in my purse
or something where I can access it
easily get a quick lip color because
this will go with anything for me this
is like the me color right there
this is the bareMinerals a brit big and
bright eyeliner in the shade of midnight
and this looks like a full size which is
cool and we'll swatch that as well oh
that's a very nice blue I really like
that blue and I always liked um you know
eyeliner pencils that roll up because
any enough to worry about sharpening
them so that's really nice and that's a
really pretty deep blue I'm really
looking forward to using that that's
really cool I'm very excited about that
and then this here is the marvelous
Moxie happy birthday fab I don't know
lip gloss that's kind of interesting
like maybe it was meant to be used for
something else and then was given away
see this does not appeal to me very much
it's a very sparkly Brown lip product I
don't know maybe when the holidays come
around now that Brown is very in maybe I
will feel differently it's actually
quite opaque for a gloss smell is very
strong very candy creamy candy like
smell and I think these are the ones
that have the minty flavor in them like
I can feel it cooling a bit on my hand
I'm not sure about this one we'll have
to wait and see not sure but Brown's
very in so I don't know okay moving
on this is a brush boom I like this
brush this is a nice brush but are you
brush this is very cool it actually
reminds me of my Wayne Goss number 20
brush this is really nice for getting
color right up in that crease but it's
not very bendy it's very very very
pointy I wonder what its purpose is it
says rock and roll on it this is very
nice for a pack in color on the lid let
me see if it says on here it just says D
slash e rock and roll brush with chand
handle but I am excited to use this
brush this is good this might even be
good for lower lash line because it's
stiff enough to add color to the lower
lash line
well sing definitely good for detailing
very cool I don't have any brushes like
this that are this tiny any short so
very cool and my Wayne Goss one isn't
quite as stiff as this so I don't have
anything quite like it that's cool I'm
excited about that and then this is also
a full-size this is smoked and defined
double-ended kohl and liquid eyeliner
cool man because so this is the Kohl
side there's that and it's kind of hard
it doesn't look super opaque so that's
gonna take a little bit of work and then
this is the liquid sign oh my goodness
it's green oh it's right there oh my
goodness that is so pretty I'm not sure
about the tip if I like the tip 100% but
that color is rockin I'm excited about
that color super excited about that and
then this here is the bareMinerals
lasting line forever brandy long wearing
eyeliner okay let's see what color this
is it looks like no is that black or is
that purple I don't know it's kind of
hard to tell the shade whether it's just
not a very opaque black let me show you
it's like a purpley kind of black I
don't know that's a weird shade brownish
grayish purpley kind of color I don't
know not real sure about that and it's
got so much tip on the back ooh you just
came out and a little sharpener I'm
assuming that's what that is a little
sharpener so that's cool okay I'm not as
excited about this
product but that's okay that's right I
still have a lot of good stuff and then
it looks like two more things in here
this is the bareMinerals
ooh summer bisque this must be oh it
says concealer multitasking SPF 20
concealer so this was not it's
customized to my skin tone so I guess if
someone was not my skin tone maybe they
could use a sprit under eye brightener
or as an eye shadow maybe like an eye
shadow base let's see this happens to be
very close to my skin tone I feel very
lucky with that okay and I don't know
how that's going to work as a concealer
doesn't seem super opaque but we'll try
it we'll try and that looks like about
half size and then this here this is
bare minerals ready illuminating
touch-up bail-in translucent
cool illuminating touch-up veil so we'll
see what that means says hello how can
you see that hello
oh good bye we're gonna use a little pad
and we're gonna swatch that on my hands
it's very light for my skin tone but
again this is supposed to be a
brightening veil so let me tap a little
under my under eyes and see what happens
I'm just gonna kind of how'd that do
kind of hard to see my phones tweeting
at me who's talking to me there we go
Helen oh did it brighten maybe it's hard
to tell this little teeny tiny monitor
but I am excited to try this and play
with this I think that's very cool very
cool
so for my 30 oh and there's something
else in here one more thing this is a
bareMinerals cell renewal night serum
and it's just a little bubbly sample
there okay so over my thirty dollars I
got this bag I got this cell Ranil night
cream I got three eyeliner products I
got this eyeliner with the smudger I got
this dual and a tie line
and then I got this bright eyeliner in
midnight I got this dual ended brush
I got a probably full size lip gloss I
got too many lip sticks
I got a mini concealer powder concealer
I got a mini translucent veil so for me
I feel like this is definitely worth $30
I don't feel like it's worth a great
deal more than $30 that's just me
personally thinking about whether I
would have purchased things on my own no
counting the brush you have one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
things so that goes to three dollars for
each thing so this is definitely worth
three dollars I don't think these
lipsticks are quite worth three dot well
they're probably worth three dollars I
don't think there's anything here that
isn't worth at least three dollars so I
definitely think this is worth thirty
bucks
I think that this was a great deal and I
do think that I would purchase this
again I would love to hear your thoughts
down in the comments below of whether
you feel like this was worth thirty
dollars to you and I thank you so much
