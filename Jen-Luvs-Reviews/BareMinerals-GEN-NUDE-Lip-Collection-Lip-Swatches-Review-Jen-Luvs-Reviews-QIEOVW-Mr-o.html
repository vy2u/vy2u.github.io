Oh dog really you want some lip gloss
you want some lip gloss hello my friends
welcome to my review of the Jen new line
by bareMinerals it is a lip line there
are lipsticks lip glosses and liquid
lipsticks that I'm going to be swatching
and reviewing for you today I did get
quite a few of these with my Ipsy points
I got all of the regular lipsticks and I
also got all the lip glosses from Ipsy
all of the liquid lipsticks were
purchased by me personally and I'm
excited to share with you my review of
these today
if you ever signed up for epsy using my
link you probably contributed to this
video so I want to thank you so much for
doing that and let's go ahead and jump
right into the packaging and then I'm
going to do some swatches and then I
will give you my full review so let's
start with the lipsticks the lipsticks
are here there are 20 lipsticks in this
line I have 7 of them to swatch for you
today they come in a hard pack ax Jing
it's almost like a metal it's kind of
heavy
and then they look like that on the
inside and we have the liquid lipsticks
there are 20 shades also in the liquid
lipstick line again I have seven of them
for you to test today now there is a
little bit of difference in formula
between these so just be aware of that
so I can only speak to the 7 shades that
I have but I will be telling you a
little bit more about these they're in a
frosty packaging they do have a doe foot
applicator and yeah so that's basically
the liquid lipstick and how that looks
it looks like there are 15 shades of lip
gloss and again I have seven of them for
you to show you today the lip gloss is
in the same packaging as the liquid
lipstick but the liquid lipstick is
frosted and the lip gloss is not frosted
dofor applicator all the packaging is
very heavy for a liquid lipstick I mean
of course not Marie hoping because you
know we're not like lifting weights here
but they're heavy for two traditional
lip products that glass is very very
thick walled
and they're very nice but I do have some
critiques about this packaging but I'll
go into that when I get into the review
so let's go ahead and just go right into
the lip swatches and we'll be right
you of the lipsticks the regular
lipsticks as you can see they don't
really go on super opaque except for the
one controversy though really really
light one that was kind of crazy that
one's a little bit weird I can see that
working for very few people but I just
put up a Instagram video on my Instagram
which is Jim Lowe's reviews talking
about how to use shades like controversy
to do an ombre lip so if you want to
learn about that you can check that out
on Instagram but yeah I mean that's
pretty much all I can see really using
controversy for because it's just it's a
crazy pale lip I mean some people maybe
that's the style that you enjoy wearing
that's not something that I personally
can pull off but there are people that
can pull off a shade like this so if
that's you go for it the rest of them I
feel like they're just you know they're
very subtle lipsticks they a lot of them
are very your lips but better kinds of
shades there's ones for different skin
tones and of course they're gonna look
different on different skin tones
personally I really like the formula in
that it's very moist it's very easy to
go on it's not patchy it feels good on
the lips
Wednesday's particularly hydrating but
it's not like a dehydrating it has a
nice smooth feel to it lasting power is
not good lasting power they do fade
evenly but they don't last longer than a
couple of hours before they're
completely gone even if I don't eat or
drink anything they're pretty much gone
if you're the kind of person that ever
touches their lips or eats or drinks
during the day forget it there it's
going to be like you put it on an hour
later you got to put it on again an hour
later got to put it on again it's like
that kind of formula instead of these is
a very mild candy smell if you're
sensitive to smells it may not bother
you because it's not super strong but
it's not an unpleasant smell in any way
my other big complaint has to do with
the packaging and if you have it in a
bag or in a drawer a lot of them are
like this where the top just falls off
super easily the magnet or whatever it
is that's holding this in place is not
very strong for most of them so just be
very aware of that if you buy this that
you don't want to just throw this in
your purse or else you're gonna have a
mess everywhere like this is just super
weak super weak but overall I mean
they're not bad lipsticks I don't really
think they're worth the price point
unless you just really or dye over that
smooth application process but I
personally don't think they're worth the
price point unfortunately even though
they are pretty colors they're just kind
of expensive I feel like there's lots of
good lip options at the drugstore that I
would personally enjoy more than these
into my favorite products which are the
liquid lipsticks I love these liquid
lipsticks I just talked about cents of
the lipsticks the liquid lipsticks smell
like chocolate pudding in my opinion
other people told me other things they
think it smells like I think it smells
like chocolate pudding just Oh smells so
good they feel really good on the lips
they're not drying at all lasting power
is really good especially the deeper
shade you go the more you're going to
see that staining effect on your lips
the lighter shades not so much but
definitely with the deeper shades I see
it on for many many many many many many
hours but it doesn't have that dry down
where they're not kiss proof until you
kind of blow them off if you want it to
be kiss proof that's all you have to do
is just take a tissue and blot off the
excess and you'll have a more kiss proof
transfer proof finish to it initial
application is very smooth it's very
slick you don't need a whole lot of
product in order to get it to be on your
lips so you can apply it sparingly the
other thing is I really like the doe
foot applicator it's like a paddle so
you can really put it right on to the
Cupid's bow I guess that's not the
cheapest boat but whatever this part of
your lip that's Chi guess that's like
part of the Cupid's bow put it right
here on the top part of your lips and it
fits perfectly up in my Cupid's bow and
I really like it a lot it's very very
nice and I would say that this is one of
my favorite liquid lipstick formulas of
all time if you like the Oprah ones or
if you like the tardis lip paints you'll
really really like these I like these
better than the lip paints I like them
about the same as the Ofra maybe a
little more maybe I don't know it's
tough because I'm pretty loyal to those
over liquid lipsticks but it's very
similar in formula to that so if you
like those you'll like these the only
other thing I want to say about the
formula is there are a couple of shades
that go on a little bit patchy this one
is called cookie this one goes on kind
of patchy and then this one called
frenemy goes on kind of patchy but what
you do is as it's starting to kind of
drive down just Pat them over your lips
for a like you saw me do it in the video
you just kind of have to Pat them over
your lips until it blends and it just
takes a little while it's a little more
effort than the other shades and I can't
speak to the other shades that I don't
own so some of them may be like that but
you have trouble with it it's really not
too bad to just kind of keep patting
until it blends out and it's really not
so bad of a process it's just you know
one extra it's just one extra step if
you don't want to do that and last but
not least the lip glosses the lip
glosses as you can see were in varying
an opacity some of them were more opaque
than others they are again those nude
colors they are thick formula they're
very very thick but they're not sticky
at all they kind of remind me of the
Mack lip glasses but without the
stickiness but like that level of
thickness the smell is very much like
the lipstick in that it has that mild
Candi smell and I like the way that they
apply they can be a little bit patchy
some of them so you kind of have to
blend them out a little bit with your
lips or with your fingertips if you
apply them over a lipstick it's not as
bad as if you apply them alone where
time is kind of like the lipsticks just
it's whenever it wears off they weigh
out wear off pretty evenly but it's not
going to last through any significant
amount of time if you want one that
lasts longer go for the liquid lipsticks
but I mean overall their glosses are
they make blowing my socks off no
they're not blow my socks off but
they're not bad either
again I don't feel like they're 100%
worth the price point but they're not
bad products at all
definitely swatch them in store and see
what you think of the formula and you
may enjoy them but I'm not like
overjoyed wowed by them but they're
pretty good they're also lip liners in
this line that I did not try so just so
you know those do exist but other than
that that's the end of my review of the

lipsticks I hope you enjoyed my review
