hello everyone it is very late in the
middle of the night my daughter just
woke up so she's going to be joining me
for this video you say hi so I went the
other day and I got some stuff at
discount outlet stores and I want to
share with you the cool awesome deals
you can get at a discount outlet store
oh that store I got and let me tell you
what I thought of this stuff to you hold
these for my bebeh these things right
here I got three maybelline eyestudio
quads and you'll not believe how much I
paid for them ah that's right Adama 50h
these are at 999 in the regular store I
got three of them and I think they're
limited edition I think that's why they
were at the outlet store so I got um
this one is in sunset seduction this one
is in spirited seas and this one is in
irresistible IV now i have to tell you
though these kind of remind me of like
Nick's I shadows and some of the other
eyeshadows that I've had that are good
but they're definitely not as good as
let's say the wet and wild eyeshadows
for drug store maybelline color tattoos
things like i know that's a different
title formula but i've never tried the
Loreal infallible so i don't know if
they compare but i wasn't the biggest
fan of these i was surprised because
people rave about how awesome these
things are and i didn't think they were
fabulous I think we'll still use them
and they're definitely worth a dollar
fifty but I'm so glad I've not pay
attended for these things individually
then this was awesome I got this
covergirl sparkling topcoat and I got
this for two dollars and I love this and
you can see I have it on my nails right
now and it is absolutely stinking a
gorgeous and it was only two dollars so
happy with this then I got some elf
eyeliners it's a three pack and i got it
for three dollars it says the retail is
six dollars so half price so awesome i
want to do a comparison of the black and
the multicolored glitter I want to do a
comparison are you sleepy baby you might
not be picking your nose in the video
again are you picking your nose in the
video again okay that's good I want to
do a comparison between the urban decay
at the elf and see which one last longer
I think that's going to be awesome
because i have a dupe for this in urban
well I should say this is a Duke for my
urban decay and distortion so I want to
try that that look for that coming up
soon subscribe so you don't miss that
but I got this for three dollars and my
favorite favorite falling that I got was
the say yes to cucumbers soothing
sensitive skin calming night cream and
what I love about this is well let me
tell you how much it costs that I love
it was whoo she's so tired it was 1499
retail price and I got it for 3 99 and I
always wanted to try this but I never
got a chance to try it because it was I
just didn't want to spend that much
money on it but one thing I love about
this is it just talks about how it's
very calming it has vitamins A and C um
and it's just very calming vitamin E a
low sweet almond oil rebuild protected
sooo sensitive skin he doesn't say
there's magic in this bottle and I don't
think there is magic in this bottle but
it really does smell nice it makes my
skin feel nice and I really like it and
this let me show you what the bottle
looks like this is what it looks like
inside and it's I mean I'm really
enjoying this it is very calming and I'm
this is this is awesome I would buy this
over that stinking what was it that you
don't even know I don't want him asking
her she's for um what was it the the
michael todd anti-aging stumped it's
like 150 dollars or something retail
this stuff i ditched that i'm not even
using that anymore i'm using this
instead because it smells good it makes
me happy so that is my hall for discount
