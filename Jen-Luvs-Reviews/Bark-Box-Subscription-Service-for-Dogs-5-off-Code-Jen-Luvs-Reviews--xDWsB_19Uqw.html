had this guy in the video we did some
guy sub some subscriptions and I asked
if you guys were interested in seeing a
bark box video and I was surprised at
how many people wanted to see a bark box
video so if you haven't met this guy yet
this is my husband John and then this is
our dog Sam Sam is some what's what's up
with Sam Sam is a seven-month-old
Britney yes and you'll sometimes hear
them referred to as a Britney spaniel as
well yeah but he's he's loving the
barkbox we're loving the barkbox this is
the medium dog subscription you can set
up for a small dog medium dog or a large
dog and I think its twenty dollars a
month if it's not i'll put a little
annotation correction but i'm pretty
sure its twenty dollars a month and we
have never been disappointed with the
barkbox they're pretty dog going amazing
do you see how i did that and let's jump
into this bark box and see what Sam got
this month comes with this beautiful
barkbox paper and there's lots of yummy
goodies in here for him just like
subscription boxes for people we get a
card with all of the things on it that
are coming here in case you want to
order anything I don't think they give
you discounts like a lot of beauty boxes
do but still it lets you know what's in
the box so first thing I'm pulling out
are these cheese please one ingredient
cheese they look like little rice cakes
for finicky dogs and training well what
do you think about that Sam Sam likes
cheese Sam loves cheese what are those
for me you go here we go and smell good
it's no he just made the video you
wanted to eat mine what is it no like
this smell like um if you ever if you've
ever cracked crabs they smell like like
melted butter on crack
I'm sounds cool so this one here the
next thing is mr. barks you didn't win
did you know okay good mr. barks cool
treats all natural smoothies for dogs
just freeze you guys didn't see so my
homie didn't that's disgusting huh
what's wrong with you good talk it said
what what's that one ingredient but
still why would you do that nothing to
see here I don't know if you knew this
guy though you would know that he does
weird things like that that's why I love
him is cuz he's unique but anyway from
oh gosh be the next thing don't eat this
to all right this is for Sam this is mr.
barks miss cool treats all natural
smoothies for dogs just freeze and eat
that's really cool so it's like a little
pot and you freeze it in this like
little ice cream that's so cool that's
pretty cool what did he get another one
stop it there for oh you're so nasty add
any of your husband's eat the dog treats
I hope not okay anyway so you get one
cup of this I think this is really cool
it is wheat gluten and dairy free which
is nice and it says apples and bananas
are also in here that's really cool that
sounds like fun Sam loves ice cubes so I
think he'll really enjoy that next up is
all natural dog biscuit company by Bach
Bach ease manly Bochy may be like
bought you all watching bocce's bakery
like bocce's bakery bocce's bakery
truffle mac and cheese young's and these
are just uh dog biscuit school and says
bacon and truffle again no preservatives
wheat-free extra yummy 100% us a sourced
cool awesome so again this is like such
a great value I love this stuff okay and
then we got another giant bag of dog
treats this one is lamb flavored it's by
superior forms pet provisions again made
in the USA grain free American and New
Zealand lamb New Zealand's like all
about the lamb so that's kind of cool
and the thing I like about bark box from
we've gotten a couple boxes so far we're
a few boxes into our subscriptions and
it always just seems like I send really
quality stuff but the trend the treats
that they send our
or good quality ingredients and grain
free and stuff like that and I think
that that's important and the and the
toys I've been told you yeah last month
he they sent a toy that he played with
for like the whole month it was like a
squeezee water bottle plush pet kind of
thing but we saw him the stored it was
like $21 or something like that all
right speaking of toys last thing in
here is a tween they usually include
some kind of toy and this thing is so
funny it's a Cuban stogie doggy this is
Cuban stalky fetch dick doggy sto ggie
nice doggy you want that here you want
it to fetch stick that's so cool and
this is Sam give it back for a minute
give it back from it I got a show at
first hold on so the one I like about
this is it's really durable I mean he's
probably gonna destroy it eventually I
know right oh oh oh he's bi gonna
destroy it eventually but this will last
him quite a while he destroys pretty
this is not this does not look good when
I do this big who did the stogie man
soggy I think he's gonna play with that
for a while and i can't imagine that
being sold for less than ten dollars in
the store there's there's no way i mean
i would say this was at least worth 15
books so really happy about that Sam's
really happy with you can take that
buddy go play just overall just a really
great subscription and I do pay for this
one out right this one is not sent to me
so you know and you guys know no matter
whether it sends me or not I'm always
honest but this is definitely a win if
you have a dog highly highly recommend
barkbox it's a lot of fun together the
dogs love it and the treats really last
me all month for him so and sometimes a
lot longer like we have some treats that
are left over from a couple months ago
that we haven't finished yet so I mean
it keeps you in the treats and snacks
and again they're healthy snacks so you
don't feel bad giving them you know a
nice handful of i will put the barkbox
information down below no referral link
anything like that just go straight to
the bark back website actually we might
have a referral like I think there is a
referral like there is a referral link
but it's the same link that anybody gets
when they SAT for barkbox I think we get
a free barkbox if people sign up using
our link I thank sure but I don't know i
don't care if you want to use it that's
great i would appreciate it if not only
link also the just regular bar bug
website if you want barkbox website in
case

would be fine too so I hope you enjoyed
