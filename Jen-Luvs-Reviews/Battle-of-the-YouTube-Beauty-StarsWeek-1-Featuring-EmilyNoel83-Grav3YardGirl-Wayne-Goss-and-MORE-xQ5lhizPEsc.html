hello my friends welcome to a brand new
competition I am so excited to do this
if you are around for best in beauty i
just finished a competition over the
summer we took some of the best video
creators on YouTube with under two
thousand subscribers we pit them against
each other we came up with our winner
which was Heather from Donny sweetie and
it was a fantastic really fun time but
now we want to do something a little bit
different I have decided the name of
this competition is going to be High
star stars my cats and I start I've
decided the name of this competition is
not going to be about the best beauty
guru because we all know that some of
the best beauty gurus do not have
ridiculous amount of subscribers but I
really wanted to see which one of the
beauty video creators that has a
ridiculous amount of subscribers was
your favorites we're going to call this
battle of the YouTube beauty stars and
this is loosely based on a very very
beginning of YouTube competition created
by a gentleman named digital soul called
battle of the YouTube stars then I
created a competition called battle
YouTube non stars to celebrate some of
the people who had less subscribers on
youtube but I really want to do a
tribute to digital souls version which
was a lot of fun as well now this is a
march madness style competition so each
week we will have two people baton up
against each other in each round so i'm
going to show you who is going to be
competing against to right now
the sun is hanging low on the skyline on
the sleepy old Ohio town and the people
think that changes the devil see the Sun
is not a love and go down in the
driver's eyes are glued to Lulu
these cars
verse been
mr. well you've already
then you are always gone
first yeah welcome to the town of a son
now welcome to the town of sundown
welcome to the
the term for guys
welcome to the town of us unknown
welcome to the town of a son
Oh God so what you're going to do in the
comments below is you're going to number
one through eight and you're going to
vote for one person in each round so
we'll put a number one and then you'll
pick either eleventhgorgeous or
emilynoel83 and then for this for number
two you're going to put either
Jacqueline or Nicole whatever whoever
you want to vote for please try to stick
to the names that have been listed in
the way they have been listed in the
video clip that I just showed you if I
have to translate Mel mphs into Melissa
Raymond it's going to be difficult so
it's going to take a lot more work so
try to stick with whatever name I have
decided on for the competition if that
makes sense please keep in mind that
this is supposed to be fun please don't
get really upset if your favorite
doesn't get through we're just gonna
we're gonna have fun thank you so much

this new beauty competition boat down
