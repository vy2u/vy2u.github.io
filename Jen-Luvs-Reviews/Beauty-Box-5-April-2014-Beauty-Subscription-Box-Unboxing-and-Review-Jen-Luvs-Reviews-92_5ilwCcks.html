I'm Jen if I haven't met you before
hello it is nice to meet you I am here
to open my beauty box 5 and I am
actually in a hotel this week because i
am at IMATS in new york city i just
actually filmed a review of golden toad
and that is where i got this shirt so if
you're interested in seeing that i will
put the link down below that was the
video that I'm put up just before right
now for this one but you came to see
beauty box 5 so we're going to go ahead
and open that up and just so you know I
do get this as a promotional box but
that does not influence my ring of
beauty box five is twelve dollars per
month it's ten dollars a month if you
get it for three months and then it's
less if you get it for a full year so
when I open it up I'd see this beautiful
lady and it says something about being
busy something about routine and speed
and blah blah blah shades of beauty
something or another and then the
products are on the back which I'm going
to try to forget that I saw any of them
because I want it to be a surprise so
this one's this card says win five on us
spread the good word on Instagram win
full-size versions of this month's
products that's really cool okay so the
first thing I'm seeing is the California
collection of BH Cosmetics and I
actually already have this so those of
you that know my channel I know it well
know that when I get something that is a
duplicate I give it away to you so if
you are interested in this little
California collection bh cosmetics
eyeshadow sample i will please put a
comment down below and tell me that
you're interested in it and within the
first 24 hours of the upload of this
video you can enter to win and then
after 24 hours are over then I pick a
winner so go ahead and end of that if
you would like it if I was at my home I
would show you the one that I have but
since I am NOT I cannot show you but I
will put a picture that I steal from
somewhere of what it looks like inside
don't reach for it often but from what i
remember the colors are quite pigmented
let's see what's next I see a full size
nikic a new york lipstick and this I got
a nail polish from them one
and I liked it so much that I got a it
was like a trio or four or five some it
was a holiday collection of nail
polishes that they had on groupon
because i love the nail polish so much
so hopefully I like the lipstick just as
much and it looks like a very bright
color and it's a little bit shimmery
let's watch it yeah I don't know about
this one I'm gonna have to calm it down
with a nude let's show you up close I'm
in New York can you tell okay can we
stop with the sirens go a minute don't
they know I'm trying to shoot a video so
there is the swatch and this is too loud
for my personal tastes but we will work
with it we will I can always throw a
nude on over top and calm it down a
little bit it's like a brassy Orange II
color not quite my style it does feel
quite creamy on my hand application it's
quite opaque on my hand a little bit of
a berry smell to it so but not too
strong but kind of on the lines of the
Milani lipstick smell but a little more
very and less watermelon fruit punchy
okay so let's go into the next thing we
have these Blum naturals all-purpose
cleansing wipes and is this hands or
face I guess all-purpose cleansing wipes
contains peppermint oil so i don't know
if these are hand wipes specifically or
if they're their makeup remover wipes
i'm assuming their hand wipes and i can
always use more hand wipes i have small
children and this will be nice to throw
in my big ol purse for every day when
the kids are all yucky and they're out
playing the playground just wipe them
down with some wipes so happy to have
those Jergens natural glow ok so Jergens
natural glow three days to glow
moisturizer medium to tan ok so it's a
self-tanning lotion I've never truck so
I've never tried this one before even
though it's a drugstore product I'm
always up for trying new self tanners so
it says there's a day 1 day 2 and day
three I don't know what the deal is with
that oh I guess it's just three
applications i was i was thinking it
might be a three-step process but i
think it's three applications so that's
pretty cool it says award-winning color
and it has
great set with you isn't life golden we
will find out Jergens we will see all
right and then last in here we have a
lip definer by Bonnie Bell Montebello
really bonnibel like like things that
children use Bonnie bell because when i
think of Bonnie bell i think of those
little lip you know the little scented
lip balms ok let's see swatch it East
watching oh that's pretty horrible see
if I can scrub it on there yeah it looks
better once I did force watch us up and
not too excited about this it's in the
color baby a IE will be open to trying
that one we'll see so and they gave me
more worms this month which is funny
glass and they gave me like three worms
okay so seriously again I shouldn't be
so selfish because there's probably some
emergency somewhere and somebody is hurt
or in pain and I'm being selfish because
I want to film without sirens in the
background hopefully somebody is okay
alright so in beauty box 5 this month we
got a little bi bhcosmetics California
collection trio we've got the nikah k
full-size lipstick we got the hand wipes
we got the Jergens natural glow 3
application sample and we got the full
size i'm assuming Bonnie Bell lip liner
it was nice to see some makeup items in
beauty box 5 and 3 makeup items at that
um but you know I mean this one I think
I would give this a 3 out of 5 for this
month um you know I will have to see
what the full value is and you guys know
better than I do because I don't figure
out the full value until I'm done
shooting and can calculate everything up
