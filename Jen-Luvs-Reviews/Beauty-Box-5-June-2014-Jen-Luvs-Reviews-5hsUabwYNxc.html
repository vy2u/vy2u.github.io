beauty box fives the beauty subscription
service comes a monthly monthly yes
that's what i'ma say I lost it for a
second Slyke my brain got teleported out
of my head for a second it comes every
month and it is twelve dollars a month
if you get one month and then it's ten
dollars a month you get three months and
that's less if you get a year I am sent
this to as a promotional box but that
does not influence my review if it did
you guys would know anyway so there's no
point in not being honest with the 40
few a first thing I see in my beauty box
five are some cards win five on us
instagram instagram isn't your friend
great don't forget to thank her free
introduction box ooh so what I'll do if
you want a free introduction box the
code is free 614 at checkout and it
looks like both cards have the same code
it expires on 630 so really really
really hurry and get it in if you want a
free box or save twelve dollars off a
quarterly subscription or twelve dollars
off a year subscription okay and I don't
think that was given to me uniquely I
think that was given to everybody
alright so here is the card focusing on
iconic and easy hot weather basics okay
so let's see products on the back not
gonna look nikic a nail polish do I have
this one I think I love this one I
already have this one I got it in a
different subscription box this one's
mine this is going to be for one of you
it does cost me a little extra to ship
nail polish but I don't care it'll be
fine so Nikki Kaye nail polish it is a
really nice nail polish let me put this
one down so I don't get them confused
I'll show you mine I won't open yours
but it's a really nice polish did I get
this in the subscription box I don't
remember i might either got this in a
subscription box where i got it on
groupon and they have a holiday set I
think they might have gotten it there
but it is a really nice polish as a one
coat polish it's pretty chip-resistant
takes a few days for a chip not amazing
but it's a nice polish so if you're
interested in the Nikki Kaye nail polish
go ahead and put a comment below that
you're interested in the Polish after
about 24 hours I will cut it off I will
randomly pick a winner
I will notify them by putting a comment
under their comment i will put a comment
in the actual comments section i will
send them youtube message all of those
things whoever wins this you can have it
because i already have it okay so but it
is a really nice nail polish all right
next up we got the dreamy pink frosting
that sounds good vite a bath sulfate and
paraben free body wash nice I want to
eat this but if I didn't know better I
would like Drake this if I was a small
child I'd be like sick because I would
drink this this smells amazing it smells
like straight up like out of it like you
want to like take the can of frosting
and just eat it very excited about this
i spend like a week or so whatever
reason i was really excited and
interested in going to this website and
i cant more what it's called but i'll
put that what it is here and it tells
you all the chemicals that are in beauty
products and it tells you which ones are
really really bad and the philosophy
stuff have like a ton of really bad
stuff in it also the bath and body works
stuff some of that their stuff that i
own had some bad stuff in it so it's
nice to get some body products that are
not toxic so hopefully there's nothing
toxic in here just because it's sulfate
and paraben free doesn't mean doesn't
have other junk in it but it's a good
sign my friends it's a good sign so very
excited to try that and then this here
is the glam natural is this a mascara
black mascara and i'm not going to open
this because like too many mascaras open
right now let's let's read a little bit
about that glam natural mascara retail
is twenty-eight dollars four point two
five ounces and i don't know if this is
a full size or not i would hope not it's
hard being a girl who loves makeup and
has sensitive eyes but this mascara is
the answer to our prayers gluten free
paraben free and hypoallergenic this
vegan formula and nice list lashes and
won't irritate your pretty peepers
laraway hashtag glam natural so very
excited to try that I've tried a couple
of natural mascaras and have not been a
fan of them something about the
chemicals I'll know it's I'm not on not
natural stuff makes my lashes longer so
I just haven't been impressed with the
natural ones but hopefully this one will
go against that we got a sample pack of
weightless hydration coconut water
shampoo by organics and i've only ever
tried a couple of products from organics
did not like either of them so hopefully
this one is a little bit better
rejuvenates dehydrated strands with a
residue free formula for weightless
hydration and shine so excited to try
that and then the last thing in here s
floor ok their foil packs soothing
refiner cleanser you got to cleansers
and then to repent replenishing scrubs
exfoliates so excited to try those those
are very neat and that's we got in
beauty box five so let's see the nikah k
nail polish is five dollars which those
polishes are definitely worth five bucks
they're really really nice the organics
the retail for the full sizes or eight
bucks each mascara says twenty eight
dollars I hope that's not a full-size
the S Laura introductory collection
calming kit is $65 for 1.7 ounces okay
there's a bunch of different choices for
how much the full size is and then the
body wash for 12 ounces is eight dogs
