five times three I was so excited when
beauty box five agreed to continue to
send me beauty box five and I told him I
was only going to review it every three
months so I just because my filming
schedule is just so packed with all
kinds of boxes and I just wanted to kind
of trim some things down but they said
that it was cool if I just did it every
three months so here are three beauty
box 5s and we're going to go into them
now the best thing about this is i
actually now have an opportunity to kind
of try some of the products and let you
know how some of the more i did not get
to try everything but i did try a lot of
it so let's go ahead and jump into the
August box i will put all the
information about how much beauty box
booty box booty box ah i think it's i
know that it cost more if you only
subscribe for one month more months you
subscribe for the cheaper it is per box
i think it can get down to eight dollars
a box which is really really inexpensive
for a subscription box so if you like
what's inside I definitely suggest you
check it out i will put all the links to
beauty box five down below and i do
receive these boxes for promotion but i
promise you it does not influence my
review at all because it doesn't benefit
me it doesn't benefit you it doesn't
benefit beauty box five if I lie in any
way so let's go ahead and jump into the
August box and I will show you what is
in here every box comes with a card I
will not bore you with what it says and
it does have five products in every
single box and they are sample sizes for
the most part rarely do we get a
full-size product so let's go ahead and
start off the first thing that I got in
here is the pur Lisse SPF 30 sunscreen
and I've gotten this in multiple beauty
boxes and I do love pur Lisse just as a
brand so I don't feel like I can have
enough of this I will go through this
and I was very excited to have this it
has a very light center no it's like a
very light floral with a touch of fruit
sent it seeps in very very nicely into
the skin it's just a really nice
moisturizer I enjoy it a lot I've heard
great things from subscribers that have
dry skin that have used this product
that it's really worked very well for
them
I know that it is a sunscreen but we all
know that sunscreen will work great I'm
even in the winter time we still need to
not neglect and think the Sun has gone
so far away that it cannot destroy our
skin so very thankful to have this once
again next product is the travel light
oil free makeup wipes baile fresh and
these are I did not use this pack but
again I have tried this product before I
feel like it does fall a little short as
far as the makeup removal it does take
quite a few wipes to work that's why I
have not tried them yet because I am
kind of in a routine right now as far as
my makeup removal so I haven't tried
this particular pack but I have tried
these before and they're okay they're
not bad they're just okay let's see the
next product was a new product for me
that I have never seen before this is
the Nana co lip gloss and the retail
price for this is about 4 bucks and I
really really like this lip gloss the
packaging is super nice for four dollars
i mean this is beautiful packaging it is
a very thick if you can see let me zoom
this in for all right so if you can see
on the doe foot applicator you see how
thick that is it's very very very thick
here's a hand swatch and you can see
that too it's a lighter neuter color so
it doesn't have a ton of pigmentation
but that's okay when it comes to this
kind of gloss go ahead and apply it over
my lipstick I do have a little bit of
gloss on right now but so you can see
how it changes this is Viva Glam five
max gave me of glam five not 54 leave a
glam for ah you can see how the gloss is
actually I don't feel a stick at all
it's been a week or so since I've used
this there's no stickiness to it it's
just straight smooth I wouldn't say that
this is moisturizing but it does have a
smooth and not oily feel to it and
that's pretty true to what I remember
from using it without lip product on so
definitely a win for this especially for
how inexpensive it is and they actually
sent another product from this line that
i'm going to show you in another box
coming up soon in this video so hang
tight for that so definitely big win on
this lip gloss I really like it a lot
the next thing we got was the snow vex
and i hate to keep saying this because i
know that it bothers some people but i
have received no vex multiple times in
boxes I have never actually tried it
though because the directions say about
using it with a isilon vaporizer and
it's like dude like I got one of those
in my bathroom you know like really or
to use some kind of foil some kind of
craziness on your head I know you can
put like saran wrap on your head like
way too high maintenance for me I don't
have time for all that so what I did was
I just use this as like a leave-in
conditioner and I did let it sit on my
hair for about 30 minutes and then I
rinsed it out and it was fine I don't
think that this was anything better than
like my what is it the green one what's
the green one the the argan oil was not
argan oil what is that you know the
green stuff I'll put the name right here
I want that will the products not grains
the tub is green that stuff works really
well for me I really like the bombs
leaving conditioner this wasn't any
better than those I really feel like it
wasn't even as good as those but again I
didn't really follow the directions
correctly because I don't have a salon
vaporizer in my home so i can't really
can't really properly test this product
but i would not purchase this and then
the last thing in the august one was a
nail polish and this is by style essence
and the real estate retail price on this
is seven dollars I feel like that's very
overpriced for this polish this polish
was just a almost like a child's looking
glitter when I want to pay seven dollars
for a nail polish it's because it goes
on in one coat or because it looks
gorgeous inva is very unique but
glitters like this can be very
inexpensive and be just as good as the
expensive ones so I was not impressed
with this at a seven dollar price tag at
a three dollar price tag I really really
liked it but not at a seven so that's
that so that was the August box let's go
ahead and jump into September first
thing we got was this lashem three and
one I bright and it lifts firms and
brightens your tired I supposedly I
guess my eyes just aren't tired enough
because these this didn't really do
anything for me it was a nice
moisturizer but it does not do anything
fantastic for me i will use it up but
you know I definitely wouldn't buy the
full size but the next thing was
something that I did not get a chance to
use it's a deep
and co wash repair strengthens and
moisturizes miracle 9 complex by FUBU
for us by us maybe I don't know it says
used as a co-wash for our curly-haired
girls as a deep conditioner after
shampooing for all hair types so I'm
assuming this is kind of like the no vex
product it's like a deep conditioner I
have not used these yet but if they're
amazing they will be an empties video or
a monthly favourites video not monthly
favorites but a seasonal favorites video
coming up soon next thing we got was the
sally hansen toe spacers i haven't
broken these out yet on my toes i only
paint them like once a month and i just
haven't gotten there definitely breaking
down and needing some toe help right now
so i might break these out and use these
i don't know i mean if you use this kind
of thing then it's great if you don't
then it's not i mean i guess that's the
same thing with everything in a beauty
box but oh no this was a big fail for me
this is the nikah k I like crayon and I
was unable to use this I was very
excited but let me show you what
happened I opened it up and I'm like
yeah what happened to my product there's
no product because look where the
product is the product is inside the cab
and I can't get it out I've tried prying
it out I've tried tapping it out I've
tried putting the hair dryer on it to
try to get it to melt out I mean like
nothing is getting this thing out of
here like I can't get the sting and
product out so it is completely and
totally useless like that's rolled all
the way up so I didn't use it me see if
I can at least get a little swatch for
you from here but I don't even think
that that's fair because it's not even
going I mean there's hardly any product
that I'm even pulling from doesn't look
very opaque though does so not because
this was a bad product but because it
came broken this was a huge bust for me
I think this would have been really nice
if it hadn't been stuck into the cap and
then the last thing in this box I really
like this nail polish it's by my beauty
spa I really really like the way this
polish went on it's just it's a
beautiful beautiful color my only thing
is is it smells atrocious it has the
worst nail polish smell and it is so
strong like to the point where I'm
paying my nails
my husband John is like what are you
doing like we had open the windows like
and I don't own a single nail polish
that does that except for this one so if
you have good ventilation in your house
then this will probably a great polish
for you it went on in two coats complete
opacity took a long time for it to chip
longer than the typical polish just the
smell was insane so that is that I
purple is my favorite color so sending
two purple products i think was pretty
cool 4 sep tember so that is that that
was what we got in these sep tember box
and then let's go ahead and jump into
october i have not gotten a chance to
try as much as many things in this
because i did just receive this the
october theme is effortless allure i
will show you what we go okay there is
going to be a giveaway in this one so
hang tight first thing I opened up with
this tool ended chapstick and I actually
didn't know what to do with this I felt
like it didn't really give good
directions on what this is for so but I
actually saw it in a friend's video that
they'd gotten in a different beauty box
so I was very excited about that so
supposedly this side is for nighttime
and this side is for daytime and this is
a moisturize and then this is renew its
an anti-aging hydration lock chapstick
they are made of completely different
ingredients so it looks like the
moisturize side does have the typical
chapstick ingredients including
petrolatum which is known to dry out
your lips and kind of make your lips
addicted to the chapstick but the other
side the ver new site does not have that
it has sunflower oil and ho ho esters
and on candy Leo wax coconut oil beeswax
things like that in the renew side so I
probably be using the renew side more
than more than the moisturize side just
because my lips and petrolatum do not
agree so I'm thankful to have this I
think that's really cool to have the two
sides it's very interesting i just wish
that they would stop putting petrolatum
in their products next thing moving on
which i thought was really cool because
I've never gotten anything like this in
a beauty box before this is an extend
your beauty cosmetic tool and what you
do is you use this to scrape inside your
products to make sure you got all of the
product out which i think is super super
cool I don't know anything like this so
thankful to get that
I think that's pretty smart of beauty
box 5 to put that in there the next
thing I got is also by the lash um and
this is called picture perfect and this
is the instant wrinkle reducer and I
have not used this yet but I will keep
you updated because I do have some
pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead and
I've got some fine lines around my eyes
so I will keep you posted on how this
works if it doesn't do anything you
probably won't ever see it again but if
it is amazing i will make sure to bring
it back the next thing i'll say the
giveaway thing for last next thing i got
was this that nana cocoa nail polish and
this nail polish is stinking gorgeous it
is opaque in one coat I'm not even
kidding ladies one coat it is just
beautiful it is true to the color in the
bottle and it is gorgeous I wore this on
my nails this is the only thing though
is it did ship very very quickly but I
did not put a top coat on because i was
lazy that day and did not put a top coat
on so it didn't even last 24 hours
without a top coat but i'm curious to
see what this is going to do with the
top coat because it was beautiful to go
on it has this beautiful blue undertone
shimmer to it it's just very complex and
i really love this and the retail price
on this is really cheap if i remember
right a retail price on this is four
dollars and i think this is definitely
worth four dollars even if it does chip
it is definitely worth four dollars to
me i will pay this a million times over
a total rave on this product and then
the last thing we got and the october
box is a product i actually just got
with apes eats so i'm going to be giving
this away this is the bellapierre cheek
and lip stain in pink and let me show
you what the one is that is open okay so
this is mine this is the one that I've
tried it's pretty nice let me zoom in so
you can see the swatch okay so let me
show you what that looks like so it's
very hard that's the finger swatch put
it down here and that's the hand swatch
and let me blend it out a bit so you can
see what it would look like on the
cheeks and I really I'd like this
product so far is it amazing like a
must-have product no absolutely not but
it is fun to use it's fun to play with
it's got a pretty pink color if this is
a color that you enjoy I would recommend
and trying it out but I mean I I don't
need two of them so I'm going to be
giving away the one that I'm going to
put this one away so that I don't
accidentally give that one to you and
I'm going to be giving away this one in
the comments below so what you're going
to do is you're going to comment down
below that you're interested in the
bellapierre cheek and lip stain and
