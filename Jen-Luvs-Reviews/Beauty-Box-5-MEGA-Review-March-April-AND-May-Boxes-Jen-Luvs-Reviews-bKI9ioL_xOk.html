hello my friends welcome to my every
three months review of beauty box of
five beauty box five is kind enough to
allow me to review their box every three
months so you can get a fantastic view
of what the beauty box 5 is all about
and whether it is a good subscription
for you I have not paid any additional
money in order to make this video they
only send me the boxes and that does not
influence my review at all as it never
does so here comes my honest review of
these boxes in beauty box 5 of course a
lot of this is personal preference so
you're gonna have to look at this and
decide for yourself whether you think
this is right for you I will put all of
the pricing for beauty box 5 and down
below I do not have a referral link for
beauty box 5 I do not benefit from sign
ups alright so here we go let's get into
the first box there are five products in
every box and the first product that we
got was a sample and it was a sample of
the S lure and they call it the
introductory collection second edition
so they came with two little samples
unfortunately I only have one I don't
know what happened to the other one the
soothing refiner cleanser was one of the
products and then the other one is the
chlorophyll lifting mask I thought these
were nice products you know would I go
out of my way to purchase them probably
not but I enjoyed them I do have normal
skin so I think that's a good reason for
me not to review skincare products in
that you know I don't have problem skin
that I'll see a big effect from a lot of
skincare products but for me these were
just okay there were nice products I
enjoyed them I didn't have any negative
effects to them if I saw them in a store
on sale I probably would purchase them
both were very very nice I'm sorry I
don't have the little packet for the
math but it looked just like this it was
just kind of this maroon kind of shade
so definitely a positive on those but
not a jumping out of my seat positive
the other thing is they were foil packs
which aren't my favorites favorite to
receive as far as size goes the next
product in here is this elite
therapeutics natural collection rosemary
eucalyptus body cream this is a very
moisturizing product I really
like the quality of it the sense is a
little bit odd for me I really prefer
more fruity citrusy kinds of sense this
is more of a refreshing scent for a hand
lotion the rosemary always kind of
throws me off a bit because it reminds
me of baking turkey and chicken but
mostly the smell that I smell in this is
the eucalyptus which is much better for
me it's very fresh very invigorating and
the quality of this lotion was very very
nice not overly greasy seeped in very
nice to my skin and did not cause any
kind of problems it is a very strong
scent though so if you don't like strong
scents you will not enjoy this but
overall was very happy with this product
all right next in this box was the
scandalous mascara by Nana Coco and I
don't know why this brand doesn't get
more hype everything I ever get in a
subscription box bye Nana Coco I love I
really really love it and it's very very
affordable the retail price for this is
only $5 and this is a really nice
mascara is it the most amazing mascara
I've ever tried no absolutely not but
it's a really nice mascara and lengthens
it volumize and there is the wand it is
a rubber bristle one but it's not super
pokey it doesn't you know hurt to put on
like some rubber bristles too it's just
overall just a nice mascara it's not
overly wet it doesn't flake clumping you
have to just really work that brush in
there because it's got those rubber
bristles you can work your brush so that
it doesn't clump if you kind of wiggle
the brush but if you don't wiggle the
brush it can clump a bit but overall
just really really happy this mascara I
definitely think it's worth fun next in
this box is this eyeliner by stylee
style it's called the line and seal
twist mechanical eyeliner the retail
price on this is $4.99 and it is a very
creamy liner it goes on very very easily
the only thing about smudging it is it
does smudge away so I'll show you if you
try to smudge it it will kind of smudge
out and smudge away and that's kind of
what I found on my eyes is it lasted for
a good couple of hours but eventually it
did start kind of oozing down a bit I
only use this kind of pencils on my
lower lash line but it does start kind
of oozing down a bit and by the end of
the day it was completely gone so I mean
it's it's okay if you're only gonna wear
it for a few hours but if you want a
long wearing
I really don't particularly care for
this one it was very creamy and easy to
go on however and I also like the
roll-up style of it rather than the
sharpening kind of just a lot more
convenient but you know lasting power is
what gets me on this one and why I
didn't particularly care for it also the
color was a little bit red I don't
particularly like red toned colors on my
lower lash line I just feel like it kind
of makes them look a little bit bloody I
don't know it just wasn't it wasn't a
color that I particularly liked either
but there are some positives in the
roll-up in the the softness of it and
how easy it was to go on so if this is a
color you enjoy and you only want to
wear it for a couple of hours I would
recommend it other than that I'm not a
big fan and then finally another product
by gana Coco this is the laugh-out-loud
lip gloss the color is extremely
extremely but is probably my least
favorite product that I've ever gotten
from ana Coco not because it's a bad
product but just because the shades did
not suit me there's no way there's no
way I will wear this color it's just not
gonna happen so this is gonna have to be
passed on to a friend because this is
just it's too loud I can't I can't do
that should I put it on for fun let's
put it on for fun let me show you
alright actually not that bad you know
it's funny I apologize to Nana Coco I'm
gonna apologize right now because I
swatch it and I was like no way on God's
green earth am I gonna put this on my
lips but it actually doesn't look bad I
actually kind of like it now see now I
feel bad sorry gotta go go I'm sorry
that I judges yelled now that we've
learned together I will be the first
person to admit when I've made a mistake
and judge something wrongly I judged it
wrong and yeah I'm actually kind of
liking it let's talk a little bit more
about the product as I'm experiencing it
for the first time it doesn't have a
strong smell that I can smell right now
but when I hold it up to my nose it does
have a slight fruity scent
it doesn't feel sticky does not feel
overly oily just a very smooth
application and I'm actually enjoying it
well there we go you learn something new
every day and I learned not to judge my
lip glosses by their shade so overall
for this box do I think that it's worth
this
description price yes I do just because
I think the lipgloss just pulled it out
for me these two nanoucoco products are
fantastic I really really like them a
lot I think that this is nice for the
right person it's just the set isn't
quite my taste I did not like this just
because of the lasting power and the
shade and I don't feel like this really
added to the value much at all it was
nice to try but I don't feel like it
added some value but I do still feel
like this was and pretty good at movies
again receiving five products the first
one is this lip balm it is the lasting
smiles passion fruit mango organic lip
balm and I really enjoyed this a lot
when I used it it's got a nice
moisturizing feel to it it's got a nice
scent to it it's definitely got a very
light mango scent it's not overpowering
the moisturization is very very nice did
not feel like it was drying out my lips
really felt like it was hydrating and
definitely enjoyed this product the
number one ingredient in this is coconut
oil so if you enjoy coconut oil as a
product I think you would really really
like this lip balm next up is a product
from the brand called dance and goat and
this is the whole lip list hand lotion
and this one has another very odd smell
to me does it say what the scent is yeah
it doesn't say what the scent is okay I
haven't used this in a little while I've
used it since uh right after I got it
and I just poured it out and it was very
very watery on my hands
see if it's improved look that is not
good that's not good at all see if I can
mix it up a bit and well I don't
remember being like that when I first
got it it being oily like I mean I
drippy like that I don't know why it's
doing that that's not good though
let's say let's see if it gets any
better yeah it's getting thicker a
little bit I guess it must have settled
a bit but if you don't like that you're
not gonna like this now I've definitely
over lotion let's bring it up the arms
bitch whoa
the sense here is also very much the
very fresh like a weak kind of sense
again it's not my favorite scent it is a
little bit more oily than the one in the
previous box but not overly oily to the
point where you're gonna notice it and
feel terrible about it but
um you know I'm not excited about it
it's not my favorite product but I don't
think it's a bad product that dripping
this thing I'll know about that though
don't know about that
all right next in here is the enna cocoa
nail polish appliques I have not used
these yet but I have used this brand
before and I have really really enjoyed
this brand of nail wrap so that is the
pattern up close and I don't think this
pattern is going to be for everyone it
is a very you know it's a very sexy
print and I don't know if this is going
to be one that's gonna be easily
wearable for everyone but I can tell you
that this brand typically is a very good
brand for nail wrap so I was very
excited to see this in the beauty box 5
ok next up is a product that I was not
very excited about it too kind of made
me a little bit sad this is the style
essentials twin gloss lip gloss and it
just in the way it looks
and the way it applies and what it is it
just reminds me of children's makeup in
that it's just not it's very Dollar Tree
you know what I'm saying like it and I'm
not knocking the Dollar Tree I'm not
saying the Dollar Tree is a bad place
but to get something like this in the
subscription box like beauty box 5 I
just I don't know it's just not
something I would expect when it comes
out it does have a bit of a shimmer to
it and then when you rub it in the
shimmer kind of goes away but you do
still see that faint shimmer on your
lips I can't see it on my hand but you
do see a faint shimmer on your lips and
it doesn't come out as the two colors
from the tube it just comes out as a
single kind of mixed color it has a very
strong vanilla scent and it's just I
don't know it just not not what I'm
looking for in a subscription box you
know I don't know it just reminds me of
something that I would buy for my
daughter you know and not for me like it
just it's I don't know just just not
impressed with that in general the last
thing in here they gave us was three
packets of the first day Beauty face
cleanser and I have used this in the
past I did not use them this time but I
remember really really enjoying this
facial cleanser it is fragrance free I
remember it not stripping my skin I
remember it feeling really good I
remember being very very effective and
just cleansing my skin I don't think it
was especially for eye makeup but I
remember being feeling very good on my
actual
skin I was appreciative that they sent
three packs instead of one so that way
people can get a better sense of the
product but you know so soil packs you
know it's kind of like even though
that's more eco-friendly so you know I
guess if you put them all together at
six milliliters total of product that
you got to use to try you know and it's
a good cleanser it's a good cleanser to
try I'm trying not to be judgey I'm
trying not to be judgey and I'm having
trouble breathe in positivity
breathe out judge eNOS so let's talk
about the the April box all together now
the thing that I was most excited about
this is the lip balm and that's not a
good thing when the lip balm is the most
exciting product in a box for me
the nail polish wraps I liked but I'm
not that huge of a fan of this print but
I I would say I'm second most excited
about I did really like the facial
cleanser when I've used it in the past
so happy about that not as happy about
the lotion the scent and now just seeing
that wateriness
I'm a little put off by the product a
bit you know I think this one's on the
edge of not being worth the value
because I mean 2 3 bucks for this I
would pay a dollar for this I would pay
maybe a dollar for these maybe four
dollars for the this I mean I and then
this I would pay 6 for this but yeah
that one's not my favorite box it's not
a terrible box but it's definitely not
my favorite beauty box 5 alright moving
on to the last one which is made so the
first thing we got in here and I kind of
ripped it cuz I ripped it to open it
where was twist tweezers and tweezers on
the first jump you know you can only I
got a pair of tweezers there by by Oh
Swiss and I don't really like these
tweezers and I really should be using
these tweezers because my eyebrows need
some serious help right now but I'm lazy
and I'm gonna go get them done soon but
these are really nice tweezers they've
got that very flat edge what makes it
really easy to just kind of pick and
pluck it and just there's really nice
tweezers I was surprised at how much I
liked them when I first open up a box I
was like tweezers what but but I really
like them I do I'm very happy with them
and then next the next thing in here was
this it sends a luxury hand soap in
rosemary mint I don't know what is up
with Beauty bucks five in all of these
herbal since this is another one that I
was not a fan of the sense paint you
mostly smelled the mints but you can
definitely smell the rosemary as well
and it's I mean it's a hand soap it's a
nice hand soap it's not overly drying it
works very well as an so but it's just
you know
not excited about that at the thing I've
got least excited about in this box well
know that pairs with another thing but
there's some other good stuff in here
that make it worth it so the tweezers
are really good next thing in here is
this it the stylee style which was the
same as the eyeliner from the previous
month this is a blush highlighter stick
and this was not a very effective
product it's not very pigmented if you
like a very very light pigmentation on
your blush you'll probably really like
this I personally like a little bit of
color in my blush but let me show you
I'm gonna put it on my arm because my
hand has way too much lotion on it
and when you try to blend it it kind of
blends away so overall I'm not I'm not
impressed with this but for the right
person I think this would be a really
nice blush if you like something very
very light
okay the next product was really
exciting and I'm so happy that they got
one of these products in beauty box five
this is the Dermalogica active moist
okay and it is a face moisturizer and
this is just a really nice facial
moisturizer it just feels really good
there's like a mild soapy kind of scent
to it but it's not offensive or strong
it's just a really nice moisturizer and
I really really like this moisturizer a
lot so I was very happy to see this in
the box and then the last thing is
another thing I was very excited about
and it's this Coastal Scents brush and
this is my favorite kind of eye shadow
brush so it's really excited to see it
and I'm a huge Coastal Scents brush
Factory what the the brush looks like I
mean it's not overly dense it's
appropriately dense it's very very soft
it is the synthetic bristles and it's
just a really nice eyeshadow but it's
got a bigger section here and then it
gets thinner over here and it just feels
really good to hold it's got a really
nice weight to it and I just feel like
this I shadow brush a lot the retail
price on this brush it says is between a
dollar 95 and 250 and I
I feel like this brush is worth more
than that I just love the way it just
got a really nice weight to it I really
like it a lot so I would put this at a
higher value than it even says so
overall for the for the May box I feel
like it's one of those that's on the
fence again as far as value you know I
really really love the tweezers I really
really love the brush I really really
like the Dermalogica but does this add
up here to the value of the box I don't
know I mean I'm very happy I love them
and thankful to try them but I I don't
know I don't know if it adds up to the
value of the box and these two products
were knows for me but they may be yeses
for somebody else it's also one of those
you're gonna have to look and see
whether the products inside meet your
personal tastes and if they do the
subscription links will be down below
and if not I'll be back in three months
and you can see whether you like the
next three months or not and how those
go and whether they go in a more
valuable directions so I thank you so
