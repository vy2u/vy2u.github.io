times 3 now I just saw you know at a
time I do get beauty box my that's
promotional subscription it does not
influence my review at all as you will
see coming up very soon beauty box 5
costs twelve dollars per month if you
get it monthly if you get three months
it costs ten dollars a month if you buy
a full year it comes out to about 8 25 a
box my agreement with Beauty wax 5 is
just that I will review every three
months and just kind of give you an
overview of what I got in those boxes
which i think is awesome because then
you get to see not just one month or
three months all together so you can see
whether this is a subscription they'll
be good for you overall so let's go
ahead and start with the November box
which was by far the worst box of the
three I do apologize to beauty box five
that I'm about to destroy this box I
don't know what they were thinking I
don't know why they did this but they
redeem themselves a bitten in the next
two months so let's just show you what
we got first thing we got was an empty
bottle it's called the at Rafael feather
refillable travel bottle it's a cute
little plastic bottle and supposedly
this little bottle is worth four dollars
no four dollars and fifty cents I don't
know why I don't know who would be that
I mean it is cute but it's like really
like really I don't I don't get that one
no so know about this the next thing
that's in here are some dental picks
then tech floss picks in case 2 dot 49
cents for four of these I'm assuming no
for count of pics so this is okay so
this is 250 and they're flossers in a
beauty box really mm-hmm okay let's move
on next dove deep moisture
let's move on now we get to the kind of
the good stuff okay a little bit better
we have the Laura actually sweet be any
body butter and this actually if you
like that that that smell that that you
know florally kind of smell you like
this I mean it's definitely I mean it's
straight-up smells like PA if you know
that sense it just smells like a really
pretty little flower it smells like a
bouquet of flowers look if you've got a
really nice scented bouquet of flowers
it doesn't seep in super nicely it takes
a while for it's a seep in it feels very
wet on the skin but it is moisturizing
and it's a nice nice moisturizing body
butter but it's I mean it takes a while
for it to seep in and it's not um I
don't know if you can see it's it's not
like super creamy like in the texture i
don't know i mean it's fine it's a nice
body butter it'll get used but i
probably i would never purchase this i
would never purchase this but it's
better than toothpicks and dove and an
empty bottle so i was happy to at least
see something a little bit enough but
this is actually a good product this i
actually enjoy I use this maybe three or
four times three times three times since
November and every time I used it I
absolutely loved it and this is the map
it's by hask and it's a macadamia oil
and it says just as revitalizing shine
and hair treatment macadamia seed oil is
the third ingredient so it's got quite a
bit of it in there it isn't full
macadamia oil yeah I mean it just
basically it just revitalizes your hair
and the retail price for five eighths of
a fluid ounce is that what this is oh so
this is a full-size and it's three
dollars and i would pay three dollars
for this i think this is only worth
three dollars i would pay five dollars
for this it's a really really nice hair
wheel it definitely gives my hair shine
takes away the frizz love love love love
love this so to me this box is worth
five dollars no i wouldn't purchase this
either i mean honestly i'm gonna use it
but i would if i saw this in a store
again I wouldn't buy it so to me this
box was worth five dollars let's go
ahead and move into the December box and
see what y'all thanks see if you think
this is worth 12 or 10 or eight dollars
depending on your subscription service
costs however much you pay by the way
has a card in it that tells you what
everything is but I'll show you what we
got we got this jacqua pink champagne
hand cream with meadow foam sea oil and
I did use this a couple times I can't
remember okay yeah this one was the one
that doesn't have a good smell yeah it
doesn't have very much of a sense at all
but it moisturizes very very nicely it's
much thicker than the laura ashley one
and but it seeps in nice or two it feels
nicer but the smell is not good it
smells like plastic smells like
straight-up plastic so this is another
thing that I would not purchase so let's
move on to another thing that didn't
work for me I know I'm so sorry beauty
box five I promise you I still love you
I just don't love some of these products
this is the absolute with an exclamation
point nail polish remover in lavender
and this is something I gave this a good
try I really did and it's this little
thing here this is 32 pads this is worth
three dollars and I don't think it's
worth three dollars i'll show you how
thin these pads are i don't know if you
can see through that or not but they're
very very very thin I mean just really
flimsy and thin hopefully that gives you
an idea of what those are like they are
saturated and polished they do have kind
of like an oily kind of feel to them
which is good because i don't like nail
polish removers that make my hands feel
like or my nails feel like they're
drying out in my hands so this actually
feels moisturizing the thickness is what
messes with these you're supposed to be
able to use one pad for all of your
nails it took me probably four or five
of these to get all of my nail polish
off so definitely don't didn't like
these just for that it did remove my
polish it just took a lot of them to do
it because of the thickness of the pad
so that's another one off for me next
thing is a perfume which is a personal
preference thing and this is called
lucky number 6 and it's by lucky goodbye
lucky brand so lucky brand that makes
the they make a lot of clothing and
jewelry and things like that and this is
their perfume in this is called lucky
number 6 and this is a very oriental
fragrance it's got like a spiciness to
it you put it on I still have some
perfume on I think I mean it smells nice
it's got like a floral spicy kind of
scent
I will use this I probably wouldn't
purchase the scent but I mean it's
definitely something different and I'm
really thankful to be able to try this I
do love getting perfumes and some people
don't like getting perfumes in
subscription boxes but I really like
them and this is something different so
I was very happy and thankful to get
this even though I probably wouldn't
purchase it I will wear it i will use it
until it runs out and then the next two
things I guess this box really isn't
that much well it is better because
these are more usable things it might be
more appealing to more people but the
next thing is this juice beauty stem
cellular moisturizer and this works
really really nicely I love this as a
moisturizer my only thing is it smells
exactly like lemon pledge which I'm
finding in some beauty products that
they try to make it smell lemon Lee
lemony but it ends up smelling like
cleaner and that's what the smells like
I mean like it like it look it smells
like you I should be cleaning my wood
tables with it and that's literally my
only complain about this the performance
of this is fantastic but just the smell
if you can get past this the very strong
lemon pledge smell you will love this if
that would bother you you will not like
this but i like it i probably won't
purchase it but i like it and then the
last thing in here is an anacoco nail
polish and this is it's got very large
round glitters in it it is a clear base
with glitters in it and let me actually
put on a swatch here it is right here
next to this blue that was from my Ipsy
bag this here is the glitter now I
wasn't trying to place it or anything I
just kind of brushed the brush so this
is without effort of trying to place the
glitters in any particular place just
you can see kind of how that one is now
this one is a sephora formula x this is
kind of more where I like to go with my
coke glitters I like them to be pretty
opaque but I mean I guess if you're just
looking for a very just very subtle gold
glitter then this would be good but yeah
I don't know I mean I guess if you're
doing like one of those layering things
it would be nice where you start like
we're what you do is you are you build
from the butt from the base up or from
the tip down where you just kind of do a
layer and then you just do a little bit
thicker and then a little bit thicker as
you go down one end
I don't know how to explain it but it's
like it fades it gets thicker as it goes
so I think this would be really good for
that kind of style and that's what I'll
probably use it for so I am really happy
to have it I've been really impressed
with this nanoucoco brand overall from
getting things in subscription boxes so
i am happy to have this but i can't say
i'm super excited about it so as far as
value of this box I wouldn't buy this I
wouldn't buy this this i would pay three
dollars now maybe no it is really nice i
would pay yeah but it's so small I all
my bumpus i'm gonna say i would pay four
dollars for this just because it really
is nice i would pay five dollars for
this because this is something that I
wouldn't normally use all the time so I
wouldn't go out of my way to pay a lot
for but i would say five dollars for
this and i would pay three dollars for
this little sample of the perfume which
is probably about what it's worth so
this one to me also is not worth a whole
lot to me personally but i think this
one is more of a personal preference
thing overall I mean with these three
products I mean mm-hmm alright let's
move into January beauty bucks five I
promise I still love you I promise I
just I promise honesty I told you i was
in EOS I tell everybody be honest that's
what you're getting is honesty but I
still love you ok this one I haven't
shown a lot of love because I pretty
much just got this so the first thing
that I saw in here I was super super
super super super excited about and it's
the salon effects real nail polish
strips this is a really really nice
brand of neon nail polish strips the
reason why I like these is they're the
kind i think i'm pretty sure they're the
kind that stretch and they're real nail
polish it's not like a sticker the ones
that are like stickers I don't like
those at all but these are very very
nice so super happy to get these because
I know these are really expensive it
says that they're ten dollars but I feel
like they're more expensive than that I
feel like it my drug stores they're like
twelve or fourteen dollars so and I
really like this pattern a lot too I
actually have a shirt that would match
this perfectly so I may be goofy and
wear my shirt and my nail polish strips
at the same time maybe one day but yeah
really huge way on this one love the
next thing is a coastal scents I shadow
quad and this is there's a i'll just
show you i'll just watch them for you
there's four colors there's mint
condition sun-dried stone cold and wild
raisin and I am I love Coastal Scents I
shadows I'm a huge fan so those are the
shades and it looks like this is mint
condition this one is the next one next
to is called sun dried and then this one
is called stone cold and this one is
called wild raisin okay and let's use a
brush and let's see if they blend away
and I know they won't because it's
coastal scents nope looks great
fantastic okay they are blending a bit
which is nice i like to see the move but
i don't like to see them disappear and
that's what's happening here so it looks
like they're all shimmers except for the
wild raisin which looks like a mad
they're very creamy which is nice I love
nice creamy eye shadows and I am very
thankful to have this as far as I'm
being wearable colors i'm going to have
to play with them they probably won't be
any colors like i can't really see using
these all together for a look i think
it's a weird combination to put together
but i can see dipping into one with some
other shadows and i think that's gonna
be fun to play with so i'm happy to have
that is it a high-value odom no
absolutely not but i am thankful to have
it next up we have a couple of drugstore
products we have a soft soap nutri
systems body nourishing body wash and
this is going to end up in my gym bag
i'm always happy to have travel sized
body washes for my gym bag and this
one's really cool it's got these cool
little floaty thingies in there i'm
curious to see what's gonna happen to
those when they come out whether they'll
just pop or but feel like anything I
don't know they don't move which is kind
of weird very odd like why aren't you
moving why don't they move are there
moving with the air bubble but I am
thankful to have it again not a high
value item but I'm happy to have it and
then also they put in a Garnier's
fructis daily care shampoo
and there's a sodium laureth sulfate in
here which is the one I believe that
fades hair color so I won't be using
this I'll be passing it along probably
to John I'll let John use and he doesn't
have color treated hair if he wants it
he can have it the smell of these are
usually pretty good smells good it
smells fruity I haven't bought a garnier
fructis shampoo in a long long time is
this how does a soft soap smell it smell
so p Toby pin with a touch of fruit and
then the last thing in here is also
something that's exciting this is the
ultra flesh gold standard ultimate luck
/ thickening mascara and I am in need of
opening a mascara and I is because I
want to test this I am going to open it
and see what it looks like let's see ok
so it's rubber bristles it looks very
very dry which concerns me it looks very
very dry maybe it's because I just
pulled it out but it's really you see
how it's let me show you see how it's
really pushing against the sides of the
tube that is not a good sign because
that means that probably the product is
staying inside the tube and when it goes
back in is probably going to start
collecting around the outside of the
tube so I not sure how that's going to
work but I will keep you posted in my
sample out challenge that I'm doing with
my friend Mandy hashtag sampled out on
Instagram I will keep you posted on that
holy moly it says a retail price on full
size is $21 Wow layer 2 or 3 coach for
the most vavavoom three coats very rare
do they tell us three coats mmm not a
good sign okay so as far as value for
the January box I mean I'm super excited
about this I would definitely pay ten
bucks for that that's just a personal
thing I know some people would not pay
10 knowledge for it I would because I
love these things I would let's see what
else was in here the Coastal Scents i
will pay two dollars for that i would
pay three dollars for this i would
definitely buy that i wouldn't have
bought this just because it's got the
laureth sulfate in it and then what
was in here the mascara I paid no no
three dollars to try this I mean I'm not
impressed with the one and everything as
of now as far as the dry formula the
jury is out on how much I would pay for
this but initially will say three
dollars maybe more maybe nothing
depending on how it works I don't know
I'm really hoping the beauty box 5
continues to improve on the products
there including basically when it comes
down to is if if I saw these products in
a box on a shelf for twelve dollars
would I buy it and the answer for this
one is definitely yes and it has to do
with this the other two definitely no I
would not buy them for twelve dollars so
you know I mean and again it comes down
to personal preference so that's my
preference that's what I think and I'd
love to hear what you think in the
