how will my friends welcome to my triple
review of beauty box of five bucks fives
a monthly subscription service all of
the subscription details will be down in
the description including a link
directly to beauty box 5 this is said to
me for review but that does not
influence my review at all I do not
benefit from sign ups and I am not
paying any additional money to make this
video actually this is a said video for
me well kind of sad kind of not sad but
I am NOT going to be getting beauty box
5 anymore after these boxes I want to
focus my energies my subscription box
energy is the limited energy that I have
on birchbox boxy charm and epsy so I'm
going to be cancelling this also I did
get a subscription that I paid for two
glossybox that I'm going to begin
reviewing so this one I'm sad to say we
will be going to say goodbye after this
video but before we do that let's go
ahead and see what was in these boxes
now on in October I did not receive my
beauty box five because I changed my
address and neglected to change it with
beauty box 5 so that was not their fault
but my box got lost in the mail so we're
gonna be reviewing for you july august
instead of go ahead and jump into that
now with a july box now it has been
quite a while since i got the july box
it is now beginning of november so i'm
trying to find things we moved in july
so i've got a couple of holes in here of
thing one hole of something that i'm
missing and there is one product that i
did not try so let's start with that one
first this is the one that i did not try
this is the pur Lisse make a statement
with care lisa sparkle flash tattoos
this for me personally was not something
that i am interested in i feel like this
is kind of a 37 years old i know some
people don't believe me but I'm 37 years
old so I feel like this is a little bit
young for me I feel like kind of the max
age in for me like that I would wear
these is probably like 30 like I know
that some people over 30 can probably
rock these but I personally think it's a
little bit weird for me and my personal
taste so I did not use these I've heard
these are beautiful for nail art so that
is something that
going to try it is try these with nail
art but yeah was not excited to see
these in the box but I was excited to
see was this ofra lip gloss over over
products overall are a big win for me
now I can't say that this lip gloss is
amazing though it's a typical lip gloss
it smells very nice it smells like very
cakey and it's a nice lip gloss don't
get me wrong but it's nothing magical
there's no pigmentation to it it's a lip
gloss but it's by Oprah and I happen to
really like Oprah products so I was very
happy to see this the thing the other
thing that the thing that I'm actually
missing from my box is the ofra lip
liner now I don't use a lip liners
another lip liner prison I even put it
on with this crazy lip I got going on I
still didn't put lip liner on it's just
not my thing like it's I don't know i
guess because i mostly wear nude lips I
haven't developed an appreciation for
lip liners so I didn't use the lip liner
I lost the lip liner I know what
happened to the lip liner I do know that
one of my friends on periscope I can't
remember which one told me that she was
not a fan of the ophir lip liner but I
didn't ask her why she wasn't a fan but
she said oh you know what was it was my
my ultra reporter Megan Wharton she said
she did not like the on the oprah lip
liner so I don't know that's all I can
say is from Megan's point of view so I
didn't try it i don't know i'm really
sorry but i can tell you my review of
the other products in here this is the
nanoucoco nail polish now overall I love
Nana cocoa is a brand I was not a big
fan of this nail polish I know this is
not going well and I'm sorry it's not
going well let me show you what's going
on here so I put these on my swatch feel
this is warm coat two coats and three
coats so it's definitely a three coat
polish chip why's this chips in about
two days which is relatively typical for
me it's not terrible but it's definitely
not great as far as the chip time and it
does take three coats which is kind of
man I have some nanoucoco nail polishes
that I really like this one isn't my
favorite one but it's a beautiful color
and I'm very happy to have it it's just
you know yeah alright and then the last
thing in here with another man
me and we got these foil packs of these
love life skin intense recovery cream
and then the restorative night cream now
I use one of each packet and I save
these the smell is a little bit weird
for me they did feel very very nice I
really like the serum the serum comes
out kind of like a lotion but I love the
way that it felt on my skin it felt
really really nice on my skin same thing
with the night cream but you really have
to I mean these packs aren't even full
like you have to like squeeze it up
together it's point zero three fluid
ounces in each one it was just it's one
milliliter I mean it was just really
hard to get enough product out even for
a full use I felt like it was barely
enough for all of July beauty marks five
was very mad for me I was not really
excited about very much in it um
probably the most exciting thing for me
was the three coat nail polish so that's
not really very good but that's just a
personal preference thing I mean if you
like lip glosses just plain lip glosses
this may be good for you if you like
these two tattoos these things can be
very expensive and pure lisa is a very
nice brand so maybe that's exciting for
you and then the night cream I mean
maybe you I don't know I just wish that
they had given a little bit more so
maybe I could try it for a week you know
like I think I don't think it's too much
to ask for a week's worth of product in
a sample you know am I wrong here am i
off here but anyway yeah so it wasn't a
big fan of this one let's go ahead and
move on to all so this was a very very
interesting one this was the August I'm
laughing already because I can't wait to
show you one of these things in here um
okay let's just do it let's just do it
okay first thing in here was a very cute
nail file it's got this little nail file
case which is nice if you're gonna throw
it in your purse so that you know you
don't get nailed shavings all over the
inside of your purse or whatever and it
protects the nail file from rubbing
against things in your bag and wasting
it but I wasn't very excited about it
let's just leave it at that okay so nail
file this stuff is actually really
awesome I did not try it this time I
have tried this product before the
macadamia oil product by a brand called
half this these products are fabulous
they're absolutely
and I have used this before but I wanted
to show it to you intact I knew it was
going to be a very messy container if i
tried to use this and then bring it back
for the video and because i already
tried it i didn't open it this
particular one but i can tell you this
is an amazing product I believe it is
drugstore priced for the full-size let
me look yes retail is two dollars and
thirty-nine cents I mean this is or if
you can find this branding a drugstore I
strongly strongly recommends picking up
a prod products from this brand they're
very very nice the next thing I thought
was from Shirley's and this is the pure
moist hydra balance moisturizer I've
probably gotten this six or seven times
in different subscription boxes I'm not
complaining I'm just saying that I've
gotten it many times I've tried it many
times and it's a very very nice product
it is very very highly moisturizing so
if you have dry skin this is going to be
a product that you're probably going to
really like if you have oily skin it's
probably way too intense for you even
somebody with combo skin and may be too
intense for your oily areas but it's for
my normal skin it's very nice but I have
to use it sparingly and I do like it it
smells very fresh and clean it's got a
nice feeling to it it is for a day and
night moisturizer and I do really like
this product I've just gotten in a
million bazillion gazillion times open
it up and I was like another one of
those oh my goodness but it is a nice
product so I'm not going to complain
next thing in here is something that I
could have really loved I could have
loved it but the shade I don't know what
they were thinking this is the star
looks looks long-wear eyeliner pen this
is a really nice eyeliner pen let me
show you it's super nice but it's also
burgundy and if you've been putting on
makeup and you've ever tried burgundy
eyeliner it kind of makes your eyes look
bloody so it takes some work to work
with it you have to put it what I do
with it is I put it on and then I'll put
a black over top very close to my
lashline and that really really helps a
lot as far as it make me not making my
eyes look bloody but it's just a weird
shade like I don't know if I were making
makeup I wouldn't make eyeliner the
shade eyeshadow yes because we can put
it up in our crease and it can look
beautiful but anything close to the lash
line just
so very nice product very weird shade
and then the last thing in here I looked
at this and I was like you have got to
be kidding me this is from an oz seen on
TV brand okay I'm just I'm giggling
because I looked at this I was like you
have got to be kidding me like are you
serious like how old am I am i 12 like
what is going on here but this is the
thing the eyeshadows are actually really
nice hate to say it where they're
actually really good quality items I did
Duke a couple of looks with these
eyeshadows and other palettes obviously
I'm not gonna be able to use these three
eyeshadows in a look it would just look
ridiculous like welcome back Madonna and
the 80s I mean just really and the lip
glosses are just very basic lip glosses
there's not much to him but the
eyeshadows actually are really nice
quality I can swatch them for you
they're actually really soft and really
buttery and very nice this cannot be
good these cannot be good but they
actually are they're actually really
nice shadows yes what are you looking at
it I mean really I don't beauty box five
I love you but you need you need to work
on what's going in your boxes because I
don't think anybody's gonna take this
seriously I really don't even though
they're really high calling shadows I
don't think anybody gonna take it
seriously are you taking this seriously
right now are you serious cuz i'm not
i'm not feeling serious so overall for
the august bucks i'm sorry i can't stop
laughing i actually find these shades to
be useful the lip glosses no but i can
use them if i'm looking for these kinds
of colors I'll have them thanks to
beauty box five this is a really nice
moisturizer if you have dry skin so
that's a yes this is a really nice
eyeliner if you can work with the color
this is a fantastic hair
ask fantastic hair mask with drugstore
price just kind of keep that in mind and
this I was not excited by so this one is
definitely better than the one from july
but again i can see why somebody would
not be happy with this i was personally
happy with it because i can work with it
but i can see why somebody would not
have been happy all right let's move on
to the last box which was September okay
so this one actually has some really
this event let me show you my least
favorite product for us my least
favorite product was this lemon rinse
gentle clarifying treatment by beautiful
nutrition this dried my hair out
something horrible like I'm really big
into conditioning my hair I like deep
condition my hair at least twice a week
I mean I am constantly trying because I
have dyed hair I need to make sure that
it's hydrated well the directions on the
say after shampooing and conditioning as
usual thoroughly saturate your hair from
root to tip with lemon rents allow the
treatment to remain for a few seconds
before rinsing saliz desired use once or
twice a week to maintain optimal hair
health and what it's supposed to do is
it supposed to it's a clarifying
treatment so it cleans all the junk out
of your scalp and out of your hair it
just dried my hair out really really bad
and I think that part of it is that it
says to use after conditioning you're
supposed to use this and I feel like it
rinsed out all the moisture out of my
hair and I did not care for it I really
want to try this I have I only used it
the one time because I was scared to use
it again they didn't want to dry it out
further but i really want to use this
and then put conditioner in afterward
look I don't know if that like kills the
point of it because I'm putting junk
back on my hair after I've clarified it
I don't know but as is as the directions
say I can't use this it just my hair was
straw absolute straw so that was a no
for me this here is the Elizabeth mop
tints and sass and I actually already
own this I know it's where I own so many
products from subscription boxes that I
end up getting repeats sometimes so I
did not open the i am gonna say
this because this is actually my
favorite cheek stain I've ever gotten
my entire life I tried a lot of my tribe
by the bone I've tried a couple of them
and this one actually really really like
the only thing is you have to work
quickly so when you put it on your skin
then you have to rub it in and it gives
a beautiful stained but if you put it on
one spot and you don't rub it in quickly
it can stain your cheeks very quickly
and leave you a dot and you don't want
that this is also really nice for lips
and you can put on your lips very
quickly it gives a nice stain that will
last for hours and hours and hours is
not like a lipstick it's just gonna
stain your lips so definitely a plus on
this product now that's my full size
this is the one that came the sample
size that came in the box but it's still
very nice another very nice product that
I've gotten before is by Harvey print
off this perfume let me spray it have a
little bit of a cold so hopefully I
could smell it cedarwood freesia and
orange flower and really I smell a lot
of the orange flower like it smells very
citrusy to me but it's like a floral e
citrus and this smells really really
really nice it's a fantastic set it's
definitely one of my favorite sense of
all time so I was very happy to get
another one of these now a new product
from me was this bellapierre snowflake
eyeshadow and I really like this a lot
this is beautiful for inner corner
highlight and reminds me of a glamour
doll eyes eyeshadow that I had in
something unicorn I was like vanilla
unicorn I think it's just gorgeous it's
absolutely stinking gorgeous lasts a
really long time it's a very high
quality mineral size style eyeshadow i
don't know if it's actually mineral
whether you're highlighting needs to be
all over an OnPoint or you're just
tapping it into the inner corners of the
eyes you'll fall in love with this
shimmer and it really is gorgeous I
would never put this on my cheeks it's
too white for me for my cheeks but it's
beautiful on the eyes absolutely
beautiful definitely definitely
definitely awesome there and then the
last thing in here is another really
awesome product that I really like this
is the be a bombshell I crayon and hang
over it is so gorgeous so so gorgeous I
use this on the outer corner of my eyes
one day and it just oh my gosh it lasted
all day long and it blended him really
nicely with the other shadows I was
wearing that day and
I really really really really really
like this a lot on the formulas nice is
nice and creamy very blendable and again
very long wearing so this was probably
my favorite thing in the box so huge win
on this here this be a bombshell I
crayon and the retail price of this is
40 i would pay fourteen dollars for this
this rollerball of the harvey prints
also amazing the bellapierre i shadow
amazing tints and sass amazing this is
the only thing that didn't work for me
so I mean I definitely think that these
products here are definitely worth a
subscription price but this is the only
month out of the three that i would say
for me personally is worth a
subscription price the other two were
just kind of yeah crash and burn so
that's how I feel about beauty box for
life um and I like I said this is going
to be my last PT box 5 video for a while
if I can get back in the groove of
things I may pick it back up again
especially if you guys want to see more
