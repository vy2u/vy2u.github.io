of beauty box 5 I haven't done one of
these unboxings in probably about a year
I was subscribed to beauty box 5 and i
unsubscribed because i was just looking
to try something new I'd been subscribe
to them for three or four months and I
just was kind of like and I just wanted
to do something different so we know
that subscription box companies grow
typically over time so I'm curious to
see what is going to happen with beauty
box 5 and whether I like it more now
than I did back then you know it was
fine it was bad it was just you know
then so anyway so I'm excited to try
this and see what is all up with beauty
box 5 now beauty box 5 is I believe
fifteen dollars a month I know no 12
month it's twelve dollars a month and
then if you sign for three months it's
ten dollars a month and then it's
cheaper if you sign up for a full year
so i will put the information for me 2
x-5 down below if you're interested in
signing up I do not have a referral link
for them I don't believe if I do have
one if they do give me 1 i'll put it
down there or I'll just put the link
straight up to beauty box 5 so let's go
ahead and see what is in the March box
and we have a little card and it just
sets out with the old in with the new
spring cleaning it's the focus of beauty
goal is clean gorgeous skin so these are
all going to be skin products which is
kind of cool first thing I see is a
brand that I love and it's tree hut Shea
body butter and it's in coconut lime
which is a scent i typically enjoy i'm
going to go ahead and open that there's
no little safety thing on there but
that's okay okay oh that smells really
really good it smells the way you would
imagine coconut lime with snow body
butters typically are a bit greasy to go
on but then hopefully it'll absorb
pretty nicely let's see it's a little
cold believe it or not feeling but I
really like it yeah that typical oh it
smells nicer on my skin than it did in
the jar it's a little bit more limey on
the skin yep seeping in very nicely I
had a little dive little dry patches on
my knuckles especially like my pinky
knuckles and that's just beautifully
fixed so very excited about that except
product from h2o targeted care hand and
nail cream aye sir I just chopped off my
nails I usually have nails that hang
over my fingertips I chopped them off
because they really mean some TLC I
paint them all the time and I know I'm
not helping it by painting them now but
these are my I know st. patrick's day
has passed but this this is my st.
Patrick's Day nail look because in real
time it isn't yet so so anyway my point
is is that I can definitely use some
nail cream anything to help my nails to
be stronger I am all about so very
excited about that let's see if it
smells yeah just smells like a typical
lotion not bad not great yeah it just
seeps in really nicely doesn't feel oily
or greasy yeah very nice um it does have
a little bit of a floral scent to it a
little perfume me perfumey floral that's
okay I don't care it's going on my hands
not my face so I'm okay with that good
stuff alright next I see a makeup base
I'm love trying new makeup base is very
very cool the card says that this is a
bellapierre cosmetics makeup base hides
imperfections serves as a concealer
illuminator and shadow primer very cool
I I would feel a sad because I don't
think I don't know if beauty box 5 lets
you pick skin color but i would feel sad
if someone had a deeper skin tone and
got this missing um it's slightly
pigmented let me show you so you see
it's just a tad bit pigmented so very
excited to try this i do use the mac
paint pot in painterly and i love it and
i'm curious to compare this to that and
see how it performs excited about that
very cool beauty box 5 has definitely
stepped it up since my last box this is
very very nice okay this is a handmade
bar soap by janes pick and it's all
natural so very cool and it does not
have it has a bunch of sense on the back
but it does not have the set checked so
the choices are peace gentle purity
patients kind Joe passion or love and
then it's got a description of each one
haven't have some scissors because I
just fill my Mimi box opening I was
wearing
front shirt because I'm trying to trick
you into thinking it's a different day
but so I had scissors to open that but
alright i dont trick you very well when
i'm honest with you and tell you it's
totally the same day you'll know by my
nails you ever want to know whether it's
the same day or not just check out my
nails with my nails with the same it was
the exact same day ooh strange ok so
it's kind of clear ish green and yellow
let's see if I can figure out which one
it is I'm going to guess that this one
is gentle which is eucalyptus and a low
and i'm actually going to pass this on
to my husband I think he'll really enjoy
this scent and he likes bar soaps better
than I do I'm more of like a squirt
e-sub kind of chick so I'm gonna pass
this on him I think he'll like it
there's one more thing in here and this
is bath body tools dual sided facial pad
cleanses with soft terry and exfoliates
with natural lupa that's kind of cool so
you clean your face with this side and
then you exfoliate with the other side
me why am i doing that with my teeth one
half scissors it's two-sided but then
you've got this like little band thing
so do I have oh so I can go like that
and I can cleanse and then I can go like
that and I can exfoliate this feels kind
of rough from my face I don't know if I
want to scrub like that on my face but
oh no we'll see i will definitely try it
very thankful to have it very cool
beauty box 5 has definitely stepped it
up i am really excited about this so
let's do a little summary so of course
maybe bucks five you get five products
and the base price is twelve dollars for
one box ten dollars if you get three
boxes and a little cheaper if you buy a
whole year we got the tree hut shape
body butter and coconut lime we got the
primer and this can be it's a makeup
base so you can use it all is a
concealer you can use it as an eyeshadow
base i'm not sure if you can put it all
over your face or not we got the jains
pick all natural homemade boat handmade
bar so we got the h2o targeted care spa
hand and nail cream
and then we got the crazy loofah sponge
e cleaning thingy and that is by bath
body tools one thing though and they've
cut down the amount of worms beauty box
five I have a question for you what's
the purpose of including that many worms
like that's like nine worms I don't I
don't get that I don't get that like I
can't even we can't even make it rain
with that overall I think beauty box
five was a win this time I'm very
excited about it hopefully I'll be
getting more of these boxes thank you so
much to be box five we're sending me in
this box I really appreciate it if
you're interested in signing up for
beauty box five i will put the link down
