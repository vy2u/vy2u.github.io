hello everyone so this is the final
video in my series of October beauty
boxes that i received this month and
this will be a review of the box I've
tried everything that is in the box for
a little while and I feel like I can
kind of tell you what has been happening
actually there's one exception there's
one thing I didn't try in the box but
I'll get to that in a moment the first
thing on our beautiful beauty box 5 card
which is called tricks of the trade is
our theme for this month is the marg
Anna magana here you go that sounds good
the more Danny up pure argan oil and
naturally high levels of vitamin E and
skin supporting fatty acids this miracle
oil is perfect for healing skin ailments
and protecting against premature aging
use alone or mixed with you moisturizer
and it says a little bit goes a long way
and I agree with that and I actually use
this for a few nights and I put it into
my moisturizer and honestly my skin does
feel really nice when I wake up in the
morning I only use the night cream on
won't you stay green but it feels really
nice will wake up in the morning I just
take this dropper and I put one drop
into my moisturizer you just one little
drop and that's all I need to UM to
really make my skin feel nice and i
might repurchase this and i would
recommend it to anybody looking for
something to make their face feel very
nice i don't know if any of the little
vitamin e things are working i don't
know i guess it's like taking a vitamin
you don't know whether it's actually
doing anything or not um hopefully it is
hopefully it does what it says it's
going to do because i can definitely use
some fightin of the agent as i approach
that number the thing that i didn't use
yet where the showstoppers stopped the
peepshow double-stick designer tape to
keep you fashion your fashion fastened
it's like tape to keep your clothes
where you want them to I don't really
wear revealing clothes so I don't really
need this I am wearing a little bit more
of a revealing outfit for halloween so i
might be
for the first time in many many years so
I might need this for Halloween but
other than that I'm not really going to
use it this might go to my friend Kenda
if she wants it hi kan de um she used he
wears a little bit more revealing kind
of stuff so she might actually get this
instead of me the next thing that we got
is something i really liked which is the
goat house dairy lip balm and sugar kiss
sugar kisses and it's just a plain
vanilla a sugary smelling lip balm um
and it's just an ordinary lip balm and
it's nice it's made of apricot kernel
oil shea butter beeswax olive oil
hydrogenated vegetable oils and a flavor
and glitter yeah there doesn't seem to
be any more glitter so this is going to
go to my husband because he can always
use another lip balm okay let's talk
about the fur elise Elevens frown line
reducing patches okay I tell you about
these goofy things okay this is what
you're supposed to do with them see the
little picture and put a little closer I
think you're supposed to put it on that
part of your head so I'll put a picture
they out of my head with this goofy
patch on I do have some wrinkles on my
forehead that are starting to get deeper
and deeper as i express myself so i can
always use something to lessen the
wrinkles I was kind of excited to try
this I stuck it on my head and I went to
bed and I woke up in the morning and I
felt the tape he stuff on my head I
pulled it off and I was like oh that
feels kind of weird I'm not sure about
the stuff my eyebrows were like my old
Lee Nam like they were puffy and kind of
Numb it was really weird I will say
though that the wrinkle that it did
cover um it did seem to be less and some
I think that it did work a little bit
but here was the downside you know you
get like a bandage at the doctor like
not a band-aid but like those white
bandages you get at the doctor and it
leaves like a mark on your skin when you
pour it off yeah that's what the stick
to my head so for like an hour I had
like a patch shaped mark on my head for
like an hour so um yeah I was curious
about these because I did see them on
hautelook once and I'll say oh those are
kind of
sing I wonder if they actually work and
it did kind of work a little bit I did
only use one because it was a little
scared to use it again um but it did
kind of work so if you're curious about
these I would recommend trying it um but
be prepared for some weird reactions
like numbness and puffiness and
strangeness in the head area so the next
thing that I got was this lash card okay
this is kind of lame to be completely
honest here's the idea of it this is
what you're supposed to do you're
supposed to put it behind your eyelashes
like that and I did try to use this it
was very awkward to you I mean like
you're putting it like this on your eye
and then you're trying to put your
mascara on and it's just awkward as all
get up it says it helps prevent mascara
smudging and clumping I can see how that
would happen but I just don't have the
patience to play with it enough and I'm
good enough with my mascara that I don't
need something like this I guess if I
did it enough it was worth it I will use
it more but really all it is is a piece
of card but it's like a it's a good
index card so yeah would not be
repurchasing these even if they did work
the final thing in this actually was my
favorite thing which I'm surprised that
I like this was this city lips um it's
like a lip plumper thing this is in the
shade Sin City and it's a clear gloss
and you put it under your lipstick or
over your lipstick whichever way you
want to do it we do mmm see how that's
sticky it looks like it's very thick it
looks stickier than it actually is I put
it on my lips before I put my um my
lipstick on I already have kind of big
lips so I don't really need a plumber
but I really think that this stuff
worked I really do I I enjoyed this and
and what's weird is when you put it on
it kind of feels like when you're like a
mild version when your foot falls asleep
and you feel the pins and needles like
you kind of feel that in your lips it's
weird like flip floppers I've had before
are like kind of minty this is not minty
it's like almost a little bit on the
painful suffice which is is weird that i
like that i don't know what does about
me and I don't
I'm going to repurchase because my lips
are big enough as they are but if
somebody said hey my lips are tiny honey
lip plumper i would recommend them
getting this the favorite of the box was
the city lips lip plumper followed by
the goat house dairy lip balm which was
just an ordinary lip balm but i was
happy to get for you have ten bucks big
the weird one of the box was this for at
least 11 s brown line producing patches
very odd might work for some people
didn't work for me and the last card
completely thrown in the trash this
stupid it's stupid guys all I have to
say stupid and I don't know about these
showstopper Peep Show things if they're
fabulous it kinda like some i'll let you

did work if she didn't like them you'll
