second round of my beauty box videos for
September and this one is all about
beauty box 5 I was overall very happy
with this box um i have to say i have
not tried everything in the box because
this was one thing we got in the box was
these false lashes and I if you watch my
foot thank you talking about my for TBD
questions video but there's a lot of
information in that video my theory that
my few t my my 40 beauty questions video
I talked about how I am not good at
putting on false lashes I really want to
learn how to put on false lashes but I
at this point I'm not good at it I don't
really know how to do it so these are
still in the Box being safe for someone
can show me what to do with those so um
they look really pretty they look really
natural um there are natural false
eyelashes and they are made by Holly
Wren um other thing that I haven't use
yet because I don't take baths I did
open it so that I could smell it um goat
house dairy bath melts in angel kiss and
that's what that looks like and it is a
wonderfully handcrafted genuine goat's
milk toiletry and it smells really nice
got like a vanilla creamy kind of smell
to it and it looks like that on the
inside but yeah it smells really nice
it's just not something that I would use
next up the hydro punch shampoo
hydrating shampoo by new me it says it's
got ceratin k a sage extract bamboo
extract argan oil from Morocco no
parabens paraffins or SLS for dry or
colored hair so that works out well for
me and that
do have colored hair I didn't notice
anything spectacular about this the full
size of this runs you 25 bucks um will
not be repurchasing this it was a decent
shampoo um the smell was not good I
don't know like a like a clean smelling
candle mixed with rubbing alcohol yeah I
don't I don't enjoy the smell of it at
all um it didn't really do anything
fabulous for my hair I didn't do
anything bad for my it wasn't bad but I
didn't notice any kind of crazy
wonderfulness when I used it um but I
think that when you use a shampoo with
its paired conditioner you sometimes get
different results yeah not too crazy
about it not bad but will not be
repurchasing this ok the next thing we
got this thing I have never seen
anything like this this is like the
weirdest thing it's by hwood beauty and
it is beautiful packaging I love the
packaging it looks kind of like a little
bullet and then it's got this little
like swirly thing down here and it's in
the shade poppy and it is a lip shine is
what they call it it's not a lipstick it
is a lip shine let's check out the swine
look how gorgeous that looks you open
that up in here like oh my gosh I got
like the coolest thing ever until you
swatch it and it's like when the color
ain't no cuddle there there's nothing
that man there ain't nothing there at
all so what I did was I took my baby
lips my Maybelline Baby Lips that's was
it 399 for a baby lips something like
that and the full price of this hwood
beauty stuff is six teen dollars and I
put this next to my Maybelline Baby Lips
okay and this is in the peak it's a
peach one and look you can't even tell
which is which like you can't see either
one of them you know but and honestly I
like the hydration from the baby looks
better than this also this one's like
peaches and this smells like an old Avon
lipstick that my mom had when I was
seven so
I definitely would never repurchase this
or recommend it to be repurchased when
you can buy our baby lips for a heck of
a lot cheaper unless you like the
packaging unless you want a baby lips it
doesn't smell good that looks like
lipstick then you go ahead and spend you
sixteen dollars my favorite thing that I
gotten this was the silk naturals I
color and maybe inverness is the color
is actually she'd the full retail size
of this is four dollars and this was my
favorite thing in here this is a
gorgeous gorgeous purple shimmer loose
powder eyeshadow i don't know if you can
see that i'll try to put that up there
but what that looks like um and it is
beautiful it is very shimmery almost has
like a silver almost like a rainbow he
kind of sparkle to it but it's not
glitter chunks like my Urban Decay love
my urban decay but it's had like the
chunky glitter has got to go in that
brand but this is very light put that up
there it's like a gorgeous shimmery
purple oh my gosh it is just beautiful
lid color or crease color if you've got
something lighter on your lid just
absolutely gorgeous love it so that was
the big win of the beauty box five was
the eyeshadow which was ironically the
cheapest thing in the box um I did enjoy
the products I wouldn't probably enjoy
this if I took baths so so on the hydro
punch definitely not worth the 35 buck
price tag um could definitely hit or
miss on this one um probably a Miss on
that um it's just a lame product in a
beautiful packaging in my opinion um
what was that it oh and the eyelashes
I'm sure they will be wonderful one day
one day these will be fabulous once I
learned really how to do eyelashes
teaching that's it for beauty box 5 mad
love and I will see you in the next
video which will be my my glam / hip
seabag 4 sep tember mad love see soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
