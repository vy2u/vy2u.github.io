beauty box 5 beauty box fun and a
subscription service and it is thirteen
dollars a month if you buy one month and
then it's ten dollars a month of you buy
three months and then it's cheaper if
you buy a year this is sent to me as a
promotional subscription beauty box
which means I don't pay for it but I
promise you I will be one hundred
percent honest about what I think about
the stuff in here because it doesn't
help anybody if I am dis honest it
doesn't help you to x5 it doesn't help
you it doesn't help me it just makes me
feel like a jerk for lying you so I
won't do that and I'll be honest about
what I think about what's in this box
whoa okay so first thing I see is this
this card here it's called fresh and
focus for May 2014 and all the products
are on the back it looks like we got one
two three four five products this month
okay hmmmm alright so first thing I'm
seeing are these a ban total refresh
cooling body clothes which I just got
one of these I think in my new e test
tube maybe I forget I get too many
subscription boxes and I forget which
one I got them in but I got one of these
and I have not used it yet because I was
saving it for one of those especially
sweaty stinky days where I just needed a
body cooling cloth today is Memorial Day
in the real time so I think that maybe I
may use one of these today while I'm
outside at the cookout so yes very
excited to have these and try them they
are by ban next up i got this is so
funny because it's like the more beauty
box i get the market the same stuff over
and over again this is hello by how
Harvey prince and I got this in a
birchbox once actually I might have
gotten the band in the birchbox I don't
remember um but yeah this actually
smells really really nice it's a nice
mix up fruity and floral let's see if it
has the notes in here the top notes are
a Meyer lemon Mandarin and grapefruit
the middle whatever that's called the
forget with the technical term is
forsythia and then plumeria is in the
base is what that leads me to believe
this is a really really nice scent I do
enjoy this I do have about half of my
other little sample last I'm very
thankful to have another one alright
next I see the h2o marine cleansing gel
i have had hit or miss experiences with
h2o sometimes they're good sometimes
they make my face feel very strange has
a really small little sample but I will
definitely try it and we'll see how it
goes and then the last thing I see in
here is a met a marker aid marker eight
no cannot read it is a masquerade cute
masquerade masquerade mm-hmm hydrating
facial sheet mask and if you know me and
you know me well you know that I don't
use mass because they are feel very
gross on my face I cannot stand the
texture so these get past to my friend
mary lynn who just got two masks for me
including the one that i got in my Mimi
box it was like a big sigh face you know
the guy from Gangnam style she got that
I left it on her desk like propped up by
her computer so when she walked in she
couldn't see it and then she went to her
death good it's like this big sigh face
like sitting on her keyboard it was epic
I wish I'd had a video camera there to
like capture it but anyway send even
marilyn is gonna get this one I'm sure
she's going to be very happy it is a
weather warrior calm soothe and he'll
mask very nice for her so oh there's
something else in here yay whoo this is
a cat Eva see this is more my style cat
teva retractable waterproof eye liner
what color did idea did I get a good one
lassie oh it looks like black ok Black
is fine I can always just another black
liner let's see so what should I all
rights watch this watch any a bam bam
very very easy to go on let's see how
the smudge eNOS is smudges off not a
good smudger because it just kind of
went away when I rubbed ok so I am
excited to try this cat Eva liner I'm
curious to see how it is going to work
especially since I just saw the smudging
there so that does not give me good hope
for the water line but you never know
until you try it so I definitely am very
thankful to have this this is my
favorite thing in the box alright so in
summary we got three of these van cool
total refresh cooling body clones so and
then we got the Harvey Prince of perfume
which I am very excited about we got the
mask which it's just a personal thing
not excited about and we got the liner
which I am excited about and then we got
the h2o cool but the we got the h2o
marina cleansing gel effectively thumbs
away impurities a little tiny sample
there so is this worth it let's see the
ball the cat eva itself is worth twenty
dollars according to this so that would
be worth more than the subscription
price if i were to pay full price for
this so I mean it really I think this
one is a personal preference one of
whether this will be worth 13 or ten
dollars to you from me personally I
think that it was worth it if this is
amazing if it's not hmm probably not bah
bum bum bum so I hope you enjoyed that
beauty box 5 opening for the month of
May if you did make sure you give the
video a thumbs up mad love my friends
and I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
