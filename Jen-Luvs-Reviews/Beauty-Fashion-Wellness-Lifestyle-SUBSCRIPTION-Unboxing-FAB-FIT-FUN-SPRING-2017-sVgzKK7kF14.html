fit fun unboxing I've done quite a few
of these recently and it has gotten a
really good response from the people
that have watched them so with that fit
fun contacted me and asked me to do
another sponsor video with them I was
like yes please because I'm enjoying
them as well I use a lot of the products
that I've gotten in past boxes so I'm
really excited to get another one and
share it with you in fact that fun you
get seasonally some beauties of fitness
and wellness of lifestyle kinds of
things that everything is full side it
is 49 99 per season per box but they
guarantee you'll have over two hundred
dollars worth of stuff inside but as
with all the subscriptions you have to
really enjoy the kinds of things that
are in the box in order for it to be
worth it to you personally even if the
monetary value is higher so that's what
we're going to find out today is whether
a box like this is worth it to you
whether it's worth it to me I'll give
you my full opinion fact that fun did
send me the list of products that are in
here but I really hard not to peek I
peeked a little bit but I haven't looked
inside the box is still sealed so I'm
really excited to do first impression
with you right and now so let's go ahead
and open the ball I do have a discount
code down below that they have provided
me with for you it is not a code where I
get money off of your purchase so
whether you get it or not I get nothing
so you'll get ten dollars off and fat
but fun we'll see whether people are
coming from my videos to purchase that
fit fun and that's all that it's for so
let's go ahead and open the vault a Wes
inside I love the design of the box
bought the box is really really pretty
inside you get a magazine that has
typically all of the products listed
inside but we're not going to look at
that right now let's see we've got hair
skin and nail dummies nature's bounty I
eat these things every single day I
really really like these a lot and I
have seen a strengthening and growing of
my hair since then you probably wouldn't
know my hair is so so so thin but I can
tell a huge difference since I've been
chewing me so I'm actually really
excited to hopefully there's some in
here because I can always use more of
them because this is actually the brand
that I use it's just fact
fun TV the best workouts right your
fingertips that's interesting that bit
funds.com / TV huh all prime members get
access to most effective and innovative
workouts hmm that's interesting i have
been going to the gym lately hopefully
we'll be able to see some results soon
not yet back to protective fun who ryoji
Oh Ross karo milk reparative leave in
conditioning spray I do like some
products from brio geo I really like
their heat protecting like mask thingy
that you put in before you blow dry your
hair i actually use that today i really
really like that i didn't have good luck
with their deep conditioning mask but
i'm really excited to try this it is a
spray let's see if it smells like
anything prime it up private us it
doesn't really smell like anything very
light like milky kind of scent but very
very light so that's very exciting ooh
real her I'm fabulous liquid lipstick
lip gloss and lip liner with a lift kit
tool I tried a couple things by real her
and I haven't been blown away by it but
it's the night it's the night so I'm
curious to try this the lip kit thing is
all the rage right now so I'm curious to
see what they've done with the concept
oh it's red oh I don't really wear a lot
of red oh I'll probably try it anyway I
wish that they had done something like
maybe a little more mavi but one thing
is good about red is that it can fit a
lot of different skin tones but not
everybody really digs on red I don't
know I kind of it's hard to do a
universal lip kit that everybody is
going to enjoy the red its rural road
doesn't really smell like anything so
that's good we're about to dark this is
like a going out on the town kind of red
maybe I'll have to schedule a date night
with my husband to get a chance to use
this it says I'm tough on it and this is
a tough color so there's a liquid
lipstick and then this is the lip gloss
I believe which looks very very similar
it's not quite as opaque and if I can
feel the stickiness to it on my hand
like if it's definitely a thicker
formula but it's very opaque for a gloss
and then the lip liner said be yourself
real her i like that the lip liner is
very creamy seems very very nice and I'm
have a lot of lip liners i'm not a big
lip liner collector so it's nice to have
this shade so I'm excited about it I
wish it was a little more mommy because
that's more me but that's just me being
selfish all right dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion age-defying exfoliator
I recently had the opportunity to try
their age exfoliator the black version
and I really like that when I've never
tried the age-defying one so I'm very
very excited to try that got a little
deborah lippmann and nail polishes and i
love these shades actually just took a
light blue off my nails to put on these
st. Patrick's Day looking colors so this
is Blue Orchid and like a virgin Deborah
Lippmann nail polishes are very hit and
miss for me I wish that they were
full-size nail polishes but together
they would probably equal about one
full-size Deborah Lippmann nail polish
so it's nice as they gave to what is
this gypsy boho beach Roundy I have no
idea what that is what even is that
looks soon is this like a beach blanket
I thought it might be like a scarf or
something but I think it's like for
laying out at the beach maybe I guess
like a blanket kind of thing it says
gypsy so that's kind of cool i don't
think i have anything like this it's
kind of spin though it's almost like
tablecloth feeling huh that's kind of a
little bit of a funky smell to it but
i'm sure that will come out when you
wash it oh I don't want to get lipstick
on it oh no I got what I just did what's
in the stain stick on it real quick let
me wipe off this is why you ruin
anything else no Jen oh that was not
smart really don't do something really
dumb ins like you can't take it back and
it's like okay that's over so hopefully
I can wash that out really take the
gorgeous printed Roundy and use it to
comfortably sit on grass or sand so
that's the purpose of it and it's very
cute I like the light blue if i can get
the red stain off vent oh my gosh i'm so
mad at myself right now you getting me
all right but it is very cute will flip
it this way so we can't see that let's
pretend that didn't happen okay it's
just don't tell anybody all right
there's more stuff in here
there's lots of stuff in here we did get
the hair skin and nail dummies nature's
bounty again really love you think they
taste like strawberry they're delicious
and then there's two more things in here
this is karuna hydrating face maps and
you all know I am NOT a big fan of face
masks but I've been trying lately and
after i did be on the wet decay on the
animal face mask I'm starting to feel a
little more open to the idea of them
because I did like the way those made my
face feel make hydrating face masks and
they look like this on the inside so I'm
willing to try one and then if i don't
like it i will pass it on to my friend
mary lynn who loves these things so that
they go to a good home and then last in
here is emerald plus duv oh well that's
pretty it is a bracelet and I liked it
it's one of those that probably can sit
I don't know if this can fit everybody
though because it's pretty um it's
pretty thin so there you go that's how
the bracelet looks on it's super cute on
me I don't think this would fit someone
with a much bigger risk than me I guess
you could probably stretch it a little
bit it seems like the metal might
stretch some but I wish it was a little
bit more adjustable for people with
larger wrists I feel like this would fit
nicely on someone with a smaller wrist
of me but probably not too much larger I
feel like I'm missing something here
hold on a second oh there's something
else in here or what is this is from the
ounce in here I missed this this is
beach please bitch please this is going
to be great for bringing to the beach to
bring like sunscreen and hair ties and
things like that it seems like its water
proof I don't know if that's true enough
but it feels waterproof it feels like a
really tough canvas so I'm really
excited about this hopefully the
children don't end up saying bitch
please because that would just be odd
and strange to have my five year old
saying that but you know it is what it
is so if I had paid fifty dollars for
this do I feel like it's worth it yeah
definitely I think this is really really
cute we do a lot of like picnicking and
beach stuff over the summer so this will
be really nice to bring with us so
definitely really like that i'm excited
to try the lip can't even though i do
wish it was in a different shade I
really like the bracelet I don't know if
everyone would like this just because of
the sizing of it but I personally really
like it i buy these anyway so this is
definitely something i'll use the masks
i could probably go either way on the
nail polishes I love these shades it
really just depends on the quality of
these particular deborah lippmann nail
polishes because again the brand is hit
or miss with me and I am excited to use
the reparative leaving conditioning
spray I probably would have purchased
that to try because I have had some good
luck with some of their products and
then I am excited about this because I
do like the regular one to get the
anti-aging one is really exciting for me
so this is definitely well over worth
fifty dollars for me I know monetarily
it's worth over two hundred dollars and
I believe that so for me personally this
is definitely a thumbs up great job fab
fit fun but you have to decide review
whether this is something that you would
personally enjoy choose code jg ten for
ten dollars off that code will be down
in the scripture box in case you just
want to copy and paste it and i hope you
