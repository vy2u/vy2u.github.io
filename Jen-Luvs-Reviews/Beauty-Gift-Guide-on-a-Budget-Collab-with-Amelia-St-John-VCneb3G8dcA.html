shoot this video for you because it's
kind of multi-purpose I know a lot of
people are going out shopping right now
for gifts for people that love makeup
and they don't want to spend an arm and
a leg now I suggest against buying those
kits of makeup they're usually very
cheaply made there's a reason why it's
only ten dollars for fifty eyeshadows
most of the time they are horrible
quality the brush sets are terrible so
I've got some ideas for you where you
can kind of make your own makeup set
where everything is going to be amazing
so i'm going to show you kind of
something you and maybe throw into a
gift basket all together to kind of
create a full face look for that special
lady in your life now the big thing that
you're going to need to know if you're
gonna do this particular piece is her
skin tone target is not very good with
returns but you can go to walmart of CVS
walgreens rite aid they're all really
good with returns even if she opens it
she can still exchange it for the right
shade so don't stress out about it just
get as close as you can get and then if
it doesn't work out she can always
exchange it make sure you keep the
receipt though so my favorite drugstore
foundation and powder my favorite
foundation is the cover girl three and
one gives a really really nice medium to
full coverage just gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous foundation here the Rimmel stay
matte is amazing i have my Mac the Mac
mineralize skinfinish most people will
never be able to tell the difference
between this Rimmel stay matte and that
expensive ridiculous powder so
definitely highly recommend this my
shade here is creamy natural it's number
11 and in my shade here is buff beige
now for blush amazing amazing formulas
for blush that are very inexpensive are
the wet and wild color icon and these
blushes are fantastic I suggest you get
either this is a heather silk is really
nice for our darker skin tone but it
also works on lighter skin tone there's
also one called pearlescent pink that I
would recommend for lighter skin tones
it does have a little bit of a shimmer
to it so if you have someone that's
younger in your life that you're buying
for that may be a good choice sometimes
people that are older don't really like
the shimmer as much as younger people
and these can be found anywhere the NYX
blush is now these can only be found at
Ulta and some
targets these are also fantastic this
one is in the color natural very
beautiful on most skin tones really just
the darker the skin tone the darker you
want your blush to go really when it
comes down to it that's a kind of a
general rule of thumb doesn't always
work but for somebody that doesn't know
anything about makeup and is trying to
go shopping that's a good way to go if
someone is really really into eyeshadows
these wet and wild our palates are
fantastic please excuse the kids chatter
in the background it's daytime you know
I'm saying so these are really really
nice very creamy this would be one for
someone that doesn't wear a lot of
bright colors they do have a purple one
and a blue one that are very very nice
for people that enjoy wearing bright
color eyeshadow if you're going for some
safe stick with browns for eyeshadow you
might also be able to go with Grey's if
there are a little more adventurous but
definitely stick with browns if you're
looking for something you know is going
to work for pretty much anybody next up
we have eyeliners now I personally
prefer a pen liner for people that are
on the go very busy just want to get
going they have two favorites that are
the less expensive ones this one is the
essence stays no matter what I think you
can only get this at Ulta and only comes
in black and this is the way that lines
out and it really does stay all day long
it is a fantastic eyeliner and why i
love these / pencil liners and why i
love them over liquid liners is just the
ease of application you don't have to
worry about how much product is on there
it applies the perfect amount of product
without any effort just an amazing
formula and they're very inexpensive the
next one is the Jordana fabula no i
think you can only get these at
walgreens they come in a few different
colors brown and black or two of the
colors that it comes in it is just a
very nice and brown liner I prefer
honestly the essence 1 over the Jordana
just because of the stiffness of the fab
you later tip I feel like this one's
easier to work with but if you don't
have an Ulta near you and you can get to
a walgreens this one's really good also
check in the comments below my
subscribers know some also some other
fantastic one last time I have quite a
few mascara recommendations for you
depending on who the person is and what
kind of look you think they might be
going for whether they like a more
dramatic lash whether they want
multi-step you know they like things are
more complex or if they just you know
want something more natural for everyday
wear so the first one I want to show you
is for people that are just really ends
in makeup they want a little more of a
complicated process but a fantastic
mascara in this one this is the L'Oreal
double extent they also come in a red
packaging as well I think they're all
pretty much the same fantastic formula
what you get on one end you get a primer
on one side that kind of lengthens your
lashes before you put on the regular
mascara so Gibbs does give you extra
length the volume on this one is pretty
good but this one is very very
lengthening next up are these two these
are both a very famous drugstore
mascaras and I have a video coming up
about these and they I'm going to
compare the two because this was really
really big over the summer I believe and
then this one is a new hot mascara for
people that are on trend this one is
really really awesome this is the
voluminous butterfly mascara by l'oreal
and then this is the rocket mascara by
maybelline both of these very volumizing
very lengthening but they do have the
rubber bristles though so if you saw
them with sensitive eyes you don't want
to get these for them but if you want
someone that somebody that wants a very
dramatic lash definitely go for these
the last one I want to show you is the
almond get up and grow this does have a
growth serum in it and if somebody has
very sparse lashes and they want to um
you know really beef up their lashes
this is an excellent choice really
really nice and natural looking lash if
I to pick which one I thought would be
the best overall mascara for as many
people as possible i would pick this one
the last thing I wanted to show you is
for the people that asked for eyeshadow
brushes because there are so many
eyeshadow brushes out there there's it's
really hard to know which ones are the
best this the ego tools brushes are
actually my absolute favorite brushes
and I just found out today that the real
technique brushes and the eco tools
brushes are actually made by the same
people Real Techniques is another brush
brand that i absolutely love for face
brushes now I don't have that set in
front of me right now but the face
brushes by Real Techniques are fantastic
you can find those at old Tom these you
can find at most drug stores they also
sell them at Ulta I got these at either
Walgreens or CVS I'm not quite sure
these are going to be for a giveaway
coming up very soon does and it's just
the six-piece essential
set they also have these that sometimes
they'll come in a pouch that's like an
actual makeup brush roll that's really
nice if you can find that I would
recommend that over this because just
because it's more functional now onto
the nail polish lover in your life this
is my favorite nail polish remover and
it's the ultimate and why I love this is
because it has this soft sponge in here
that helps you take your nail polish off
and it comes off very quickly and easily
it also has this little toe dauber guy
in here to get nail polish off your toes
and absolutely love love love this one
in particular but these little tubs of
nail polish remover are very very
convenient and I would recommend these
definitely over just a bottle of nail
polish remover and then some less
expensive nail polish brands that are
also really good Sally Hansen makes some
really nice inexpensive polishes this is
the hardest nails xtreme wear and this
is the instron try both of these
formulas are fantastic and they're very
inexpensive also at one that I also love
is the Maybelline Color show these are
also really really nice polishes my
absolutely favorite from this line is
this one this is the polka dot one this
one is so stinking cool like the way the
effect that leaves on your nails it
almost looks like paint splatter so
definitely recommend this one and then
the last thing I wanted to share with
you are some Sephora purchases that you
could get for your high end makeup lover
without breaking the bank the first
recommendation I have for you is the
tart thoughtful treasures gifts
especially if the person that you're
buying for complains of a dry skin this
one comes with the American oil which is
fantastic for dry skin they tart blush
tart is known for their blushes they're
very very very popular and then also the
lip product that comes in there is also
a very wearable color for most people so
one for the perfume lover is the Sephora
favorites rollerball sampler which is
really really nice what they get is they
get little tiny perfume samples and then
they get to pick which one is their
favorite and then take it to Sephora for
a rollerball version and I don't know
too many people that go through a whole
rollerball very quickly unless it
becomes your absolute favorite if it
becomes her favorite then you're set to
go you're the one you're responsible for
it whenever she's ready she just takes
the
vouchers for ax and gets whichever one
she much which is awesome the next one I
would recommend would be fantastic for
anybody of any skin tone of any age and
it is the two faced beauty blogger
darlings set comes with a bunch of very
very high quality products for a very
inexpensive price because they are the
deluxe I sample versions you get a
chocolate Soleil bronzer which is really
nice for contouring is someone's into
contouring or in the summertime if they
enjoy putting a little bit of sun kissed
glow on their cheeks it also comes with
a fantastic face primer a fantastic
eyeshadow primer and finally it comes
with a mascara it's called the better
than sex mascara I personally haven't
tried it I've heard good things about it
not raves but good things the biggest
thing that I think is fantastic in this
are the primers the primers are amazing
i also really enjoy that bronzer so that
is a good one and it is not very
expensive at all considering what you
get so those are my recommendations for
people buying for a makeup lovers on a
budget hopefully that narrowed things
down for you I know places like the
drugstore and sephora can be very
intimidating I want to make sure to
