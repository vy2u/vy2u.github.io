interesting video this gonna be
interesting video in my heart I've
always been someone that likes to help
people if you ask me what my life's
purpose was I would tell you it's to
help people that's the way I've always
been since I was little kid always been
one to help and I feel like some of the
bigger youtubers these days need a
little bit of help from little ol me so
I'm gonna kind of break it down for you
right about now I always wanted to have
a big sister and I didn't have one I had
a big brother and he didn't really care
much about the things that I did but I
always thought if I had a big sister my
big sister would come to me and tell me
what I'm messing up now I'm about 5 to
10 years older than all of the popular
beauty gurus out there I'm not sure how
old Jacqueline is but I I'm at least at
least 5 years older than her if not 10
years older than her maybe even more I
don't know and I feel like she needs a
little bit of advice and before you
comment down below who are you with
90,000 subscribers and tell Jacqueline
what she should be doing well let me
tell you I have a challenge for you my
challenge is I dare you to watch this
video and say that I didn't make any
good points because if you look into
your heart I guarantee you I don't care
how big of a Jacqueline Hill fan you are
I bet you you're gonna find a couple of
things at least one thing you know I've
got a good point let me preface this by
saying that I just drove home from
generation Beauty three hour drive from
New York I wanted to get my favorite
pitas from my favorite pita place and
Hoboken they were having some big ole
festival down there and I saw the place
and I couldn't park because there was no
parking so I was really hungry and ended
up like off at a rest stop getting food
I didn't want so that's I'm a little
spicy tonight and you know I I'm feeling
I'm feeling like I want to just drop it
all right so I'm gonna drop it when I do
before I leave on big road trips is
set up a playlist of YouTube videos I
have unlimited data on my phone so I set
up a playlist of YouTube videos you know
new old whatever things that I want to
listen to while I'm driving I listen to
them Jacqueline Hills video was on that
playlist her brand-new video tutorial
using her palette it was on my playlist
because I got a lot of comments on my
for Jacqueline Hill videos jam why are
you doing so many videos Jacqueline's
only even done one video on her palette
and you've done for now and it's like
yeah I know but I was chairs to see what
she was gonna do with it and and how she
was gonna talk about her palate now that
it's been out for a while so I'm sitting
there and I'm listening to this video
and I'm like Oh Jacqueline what are you
doing like I'm thinking this you ever
been watching a beer creator and just
thought like what what is happening here
that's what I was thinking so I got this
idea for this video and I knew that if I
waited until the morning it wouldn't be
as good so this is what we're gonna do
I'm gonna put on Jacqueline Hills video
on my phone I'm gonna put it on the
screen for you I'm not gonna play the
whole thing because number one I don't
think it's right to put her whole video
on my channel if you want to watch the
little thing you can go to her channel
but the thing is that I want to talk
about we're gonna put here so I can kind
of comment on it one thing I learned
from a lot of the creators or generation
Beauty the people that are you know
making videos is they don't watch any of
the bigger people anymore because the
bigger people they're all about the
entertainment but as far as the quality
of the actual information you're getting
it's pretty crap okay on a lot of them
not all of them some of them are still
good some are still good but some of
them it's just like they just give
terrible information so I want to use
Jacqueline's video as an example to kind
of also help you be a more educated
viewer of YouTube videos and so you can
hold some of these bigger youtubers
accountable for cutting corners on their
reviews so they will make their videos
better and then you will gain more from
them and hopefully we'll all be able to
sing Kumbaya on a circle and it'll all
be happy and we'll all roast
marshmallows together so let's go ahead
and get into this video I'm gonna go
ahead and press play and I'm gonna give
you my honest thoughts on this video
because I think it needs to happen I
think it needs to happen
Hey
and then welcome back to my sanity yeah
I sure do yeah I do anyways for today's
video everything that you see on my face
right now is either from the drugstore
or it is affordable I think I cheated
one time okay the word affordable I hate
when people use the word affordable
because what's affordable to Jaclyn
what's affordable to me what's
affordable to you what's affordable to
him or her over there is not the same I
have been there where my overdraft on my
bank account went under by a dollar and
I got charged forty five dollars by my
bank and it put me down even lower and I
was in tears because I didn't have forty
five dollars to pay the bank the
overdraft fee okay a ten dollar eyeliner
is not affordable in that situation
dollar store might be affordable but not
a ten dollar product so I hate that word
affordable I much prefer words like
drugstore or lesser cost or less
expensive you know you see where I'm
coming from because affordable means
different things to different people and
someone that wears you know Cartier
bracelets and lives in a ginormous house
affordable is a little bit different you
know what I mean I'm not hating that she
lives in a ginormous house and stuff I'm
just saying you know that to be a little
more relatable to people who don't maybe
not using the word affordable on
products that may not be affordable to
everyone I have to say I found some
things I really loved today like this
foundation and concealer that I'm
wearing I absolutely all in the brow
pencil finally found a drugstore brow
pencil that I love my subscribers here
we're gonna we're gonna get back to the
foundation the concealer and the brow
pencil and my issue when she puts them
on hang tight you guys know the journey
I have never been able to find a brow
pencil I actually enjoy the drugstore
until two day so yes how about you guys
enjoy this tutorial I love you guys so
much until today until today because
girlfriend just tried it for the first
time today she's been looking for it her
entire life and she found it after using
it once today
the seal and perfect foundation it says
it's a two-in-one foundation and
concealer I've heard such great things
about it but I haven't actually given it
like a real try the way she hasn't given
it a real try just so you know if talked
to him something I love something I just
feel like she is she's one of the real
ones you know like everything that she
ever recommends I go out and I buy and
I'm like yes it's exactly how she
explains it exactly what she says it's
going to be she's shocked by this she's
shocked by this she's shocked by this
because there's a problem if
Jacqueline's shocked by that that Totti
is one of the real ones
meaning there are lots of fake ones like
she even knows there's a problem let's
fix this problem the pink elephant in
the room
all this drama on social media recently
like it's just really got to mean really
discouraged me this was my heart and it
made me so happy and it makes me really
sad that I lost that for a while and
just elect negativity kind of cloud my
thoughts and I truly hope that if
Jacqueline ever happens to watch this
video that she doesn't take it as
negative because that's not what I'm
trying to do I'm just I'm trying to help
really and truly this wand is so
delicate Oh oh my god oh my god I've
seen my eye oh crap oh crap oh my gosh
it's like actually singing my eyes oh
there's like a scent coming off oh it's
burning my skin okay hold on I know it
sounds to go I'm gonna try it ah am I
trying to buff it in and see what
happens
oh this is actually stinging my skin
okay no I can't do this
what see this is good this is what I'm
talking about she could have if she
wanted to if she wanted to kiss up to
L'Oreal she could have washed that off
pretended like it didn't happen and
filmed with a different concealer but
she didn't she kept it in the video
because she that that was a really smart
move and that's what I want to see more
so it's a really strange
anyways I feel bad though I hate talking
negatively
about any products Oh No Hoshi did it
I hate talking negatively about any
products girlfriend you just called
yourself out remember how you were
saying earlier about those uh those
videos that they don't always tell the
truth you just basically just said you
just called yourself out leap that's the
way I interpreted it at least that she
doesn't like to say negative things
about anything but to her credit she did
leave it in the video and I dad is
awesome this right here is my favorite
drugstore foundation concealer
combination that I think I've ever seen
on my face before grant did I have not
set with powder and granted I could not
work about the day but just applying it
holding luck
Oh moly you know what I'm just go you
know what granted I haven't tried it all
day but this is the best thing ever
please don't do that please don't do
that that's just I mean you've got kids
watching you then have allowance and
they're gonna come out and buy this
combination because Jacqueline
recommended it without you fully testing
it it's one thing if you've tested it
and you like it that's that's fine but
this is the first time you've applied it
you don't know you've admitted you don't
know anything about how it wears but yet
you're going to recommend it and it's
like pleased this has gotta stop
this is got to stop if it's a first
impression it's got to be a first
impression this is the best ever no it's
not no you don't know that you don't
know that please fix that fix that
alright Brow's are now done and I have
to say I finally have a drugstore brow
winner right here I crown thee the
winner of the drugstore not keep in mind
that my favorite brow pencil in general
and the anastasi there's a theme here
there's theme here alright before I go
in with my eyeshadow I'm just going to
put some transition powder all over my
face really quickly to catch any fallout
so I'm going to be using a lot of
product so I'm just gonna stay on this
and this
being real with you guys my mind look
traces of powder I'm using right now is
not from the drugstore it's just what
stay on my Vandy but any present powder
will work so she's not using a drugstore
powder what I would suggest for her is
to recommend at least recommend one from
the drugstore and if she doesn't no one
from the drugstore just say I don't know
one you know you can't say any
translucent powder will work because not
at every translucent powder is gonna
work and honestly I can't even off the
top of my head recommend a drugstore
translucent powder off the top my head
but to say any translucent powder will
work I don't I don't necessarily think
that's a good idea actually Coty that's
the one I can think of I've heard bad
things and good things from different
people about that but my point is don't
say anything will work because you
haven't tried everything you know - I'm
sayin serum going with this I'm just
gonna put that right kind of on top of
that color just a little bit beneath it
I always start off with the lightest
color of the highest and then I go
darker down down down
honest to god I know I just started this
look but I can already tell that I'm
gonna be freaking obsessed like you know
what I just feel it like I'm just
feeling it right now she's feeling
herself right now
she's totally feeling herself right now
I could tell you I'm wearing the
Jacqueline Hill palette on my eyes today
it's a fantastic palette if you haven't
seen my reviews of the Jacqueline Hill
palette I'll link them all down below
but it really is a fantastic palette and
that's cool that she's feeling herself
but it says it comes off as a little
little much for me but that's just me
and I'm not a huge hardcore Jacqueline
fan so hardcore Jacqueline fans might
not be as like as I was in that moment
I'm gonna mix it with a little bit of
mocha because I don't want to be too too
dark
I feel like this is Jacqueline's
strength is the tutorials she's really
good at them like really really good
it's just the reviewing I feel like
needs some work
alright then I'm gonna take a central
park that dark brown on a stiff brush
like this I'm gonna put it really tight
on my lash line so then with a really
tiny pencil brush I'm gonna blend those
two shades together that way you don't
see like the harsh line of the dark
brown that I wanted to be very blown out
and soft I love how you can really see
what she's doing I think a lot of people
fail on tutorials because they're not
doing what she's doing where you could
really look and see where the brushes
place and you can see exactly what she's
doing which is awesome I also like that
she's explaining why she's doing what
she's doing alright and we put on some
mascara really quickly and I'm gonna pop
on some false lashes you totally you're
not gonna do false lashes if you're
comfortable without them but I'm not
because I have just trained myself to
always think that I need a lash and she
didn't name the brand or the name of the
mascara and if you're not familiar with
that mascara I'm sure it would have been
helpful to know what it was I'm not
really getting much pigment for this
blush to be honest which is weird
because I've used before in the past my
boys really like them I'm not really
getting again with the honesty much
appreciated for highlight I am thinking
I'm gonna use the wet and wild and
precious petals let's see how this goes
I have used this before but I think I
was a lot Hana than this so I don't know
how this is gonna work with my skin tone
currently but oh yeah it looks really
nice and it does look really nice I
really appreciate when people say
something looks nice when it does look
nice if it doesn't look nice you gotta
say it doesn't look nice and so far
she's been on point with that I want to
sat down I started snacking you know
what
pictures an hour and half later I'm like
wait a second this is not affordable on
my lips right now so I'm gonna come back
on camera and say we're gonna change
that really quickly and give you an
affordable alternative because I just
back I feel guilty so I found this color
from the Lauria so definitely ever
credit for coming back on and changing
the lip color nice job l'oreal
infallible Pro matte liquid lipsticks
are right here and it is basically the
exact same shade as what is on my lips
so I wonder if I put it on right over
top it oh my god look at this like look
at that that's the exact same colors
what I have out it's identical okay
anyone else seeing the problem with this
wouldn't it have been better to swatch
them on your hand or something to show
that they're the same color and not
layer it over top because maybe some of
the Kat Von D is showing through the
Loreal maybe is there a lip liner on
does it look like she's wearing a lip
liner I can't say whether she is or not
because I wasn't there when she filmed
it but it looks like she's wearing a lip
liner and if she is she should have
mentioned the lip liner if she is it
looks like a lip liner though are you
guys so I am officially done I am
signing out now I hope that you enjoy
and this video even with all of the lips
mishaps we finally got to a color that I
actually really love so hopefully you've
learned a little bit about what I look
for in a YouTube video as far as things
that annoy me and bother me I don't know
if they annoy you and bother you I'd
love to hear your thoughts in the
comments below or if there was something
else in that video that stuck out stuck
out to you as being kind of hmm the
other thing I'd love onions
participation is if you watch a YouTube
video by a bigger youtuber and you get
that mmm feeling if you would leave
those in the comments below
it may be marked as spam it probably
we'll be marked as spam the video link
because when you leave a video link
usually gets marked as spam but I will
approve it and maybe we'll do this again
maybe if you like it and if Jacqueline
ever watches this I really hope that she
knows that I'm doing this to try to help
to make things better and it's not in a
malicious way in any way at all and
hopefully hopefully I've made some good
points that you can identify with thank
you so much for watching I do put out 9
videos a week we do 6 news shows a week
5 makeup minutes Monday through Friday
ful like news show on Sundays plus three
other video usually review videos a week
I was away so the schedule is a little
bit off but now I'm back we're back to
