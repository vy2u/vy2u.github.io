knees okay
your knees Amalek yay stay in the middle
so you cuz I can see how you can't see
mommy said can you sit Co yeah oh my
gosh
this is too small your children are too
big okay got it
alright hello my friends welcome to my
annual lucky bag unboxing with my
children they've been unboxing this box
with me for the past two years this is
my nine-year-old daughter Lila had my
six-year-old son John and they loved to
help me unbox my lucky bag because you
know it's like a present so if you want
to see our previous lucky bag unbagging
I will put that down in the description
box down below this might be my last
lucky bag oh no because the last couple
of years the first year I was happy the
second year I was kind of like yeah the
third year I did not like it all and
then this year is gonna be the deciding
of whether I get the one next year if
you don't know what a beauty lish lucky
bag is it's basically a mystery box of
products I paid eighty two dollars for
this including shipping we're gonna
unseal it and we're gonna see what mommy
got and see if I got a good box now it
feels very light there are some people
that do get a special mystery box with
extra stuff in it there's also an extra
large version that I did not qualify for
you have to spend a thousand dollars a
beauty lish in order to qualify for it
that was not me I agree that was not me
so I did not qualify for that and I
forget how much that one cost but I do
not qualify for it okay so inside it's
very cute and we've got a little tag
that explains what the lucky bags are
I'm gonna pass this to you guys okay and
then John why don't you go ahead and
pull something out of the box mommy's
not gonna look what does it say on it it
says by terry velvet rouge velvet
lipstick alright don't pull anything
else out yet let's go ahead and see what
this is oh he's hiding it it is already
open the box is smashed but that's okay
we don't keep the box oh that's a color
that I would use it's very
pretty it is called number one but I
would use that I think it's very nice so
for me this is a good one this may not
be the best shape for everybody but for
me I am excited about that let me go
ahead and swatch it real quick and then
Laila's while I'm doing that
Lila is going to take her trip scent
smells really yucky
it's very smell it yeah had a good time
dad it smells kind of its nose makeup
big it smells like old makeup is what it
smells like it doesn't smell oh well
let's see okay this is the skin Danai
via makeup finishing spray and if you
know me you know I don't like spring
things on my face so this will be put in
a box for a feature giveaway because
this is not my thing
alright John so we've got two things so
far John why don't you pull out the next
thing yeah okay let's see what it is I'm
not gonna look don't you pull that
that's okay I'm not looking which thing
okay hand it to me oh okay oh I heard
wonderful things about this I'm excited
this is the Jui a skinny dip palette I
heard fantastic things about this
palette I don't know what the price
point is you know because I'm putting it
on the screen right now but I have heard
great things I haven't had the best
experience with you a overall but I've
heard this palette is quite the
exception so let me go ahead and open it
up it's very large the reason why I
picked it because the largest thing you
picked the biggest thing and also
because that one yeah it's hard to hide
that one alright let me open it up so we
can look inside and see what's in here
and then Lila's gonna hand me something
so this it's smaller inside than I
thought it was going to because the box
was so big it looks like a similar size
to like an Urban Decay Naked palette and
then it's a boy oh okay
so I thought there were gonna be more
shades in here but those are very pretty
I've heard wonderful things wow those
are very very soft those are beautiful
this would have been great for my ear
you wanna hear Joey show the camera hey
my fingerprint on it
does does likely you want some whoo
what's here - everyone's finger come a
rub it on there real good so we can see
one swatch on all three of us that's
pretty cool
so that is pretty cool this would have
been great for my foiled shadow
smackdown that I just did if you didn't
watch it it's super fun I'll link it
down below but yes very cool and people
were mentioning this in a comment I have
two fingernails this one and this one
oh well there you go you want to wiped
up you can wipe that right on my hand if
you want to if it's bothering you scrape
it on my hand swatch it on my hand
so it's Lila I'm gonna close my eyes you
pick something out for me okay honey
what is this
oh okay so wash soul wasu first hair
activating mask so it is a sheet mask
there was a long time that I didn't use
sheet masks at all now I do they do have
some a lot of times some great skincare
benefits in them but because there's not
a lower long-term thing they're more
like for fun so yeah I mean I'll try it
off to look up the ingredients and see
ten to twenty minutes on this I'll look
up the ingredients and see what's going
on here I did see a little bit of a peek
but I'm gonna pretend like I didn't see
it so I am gonna look into this and I
will definitely be using it but I can't
say I'm super excited about it okay John
Stern hand me something baby you okay
I think Lila's getting a little bit of a
cold I think I think you pulled two
things one okay so we've got oh it's
that brand that I can never pronounce
how would you pronounce that six year
old Barbie how would you print out ready
okay I think it's were Bay or or a bay
yeah I think I am or Bay
I think I'm terrible with this name
everybody tells me something different
of how to say this I've seen like three
or four different pronunciations but
anyway it's a dry texturizing spray I
don't use texturising spray in my hair
my hair is very thin so when I use
texturizing spray it usually makes my
hair look pretty stringy it does except
for when it's curled and maybe I might
be able to use it but I've honestly
these kinds of things so I will probably
pass this on as well not excited about
that so I'm hoping that the last thing I
think there's one more thing in here
it's going to be something exciting and
I think it is because I got a little bit
of a gland and it's you me kiddo all
right came out that's okay
all right so this I am very excited
about this is a Wayne Goss number-16
brush isn't it pretty
okay touch it to your face and tell me
how soft it is but on your face I really
like Wayne Goss brushes alright Layla
touch to you face how's it feel so this
ain't gonna be very soft this is an
eyeshadow brush and it's gonna be really
nice for putting a blending shadows into
the crease and it's beautiful mama okay
go ahead oh so soft see ya so I'm very
excited about that very very excited so
was this box board just $82 to me
personally monetarily
no it wasn't again but I think it was
you think it was wise why honey because
I I think this would be very good for
you and the cow it's really pretty and
yes I'm very excited about this these
are the two things that I'm super
excited about the spray will go in for
future give away the this texturizing
spray will go in for a future giveaway
the sulwhasoo I could do or so-so wasu I
could do without but I will use it and
the lipstick smells old hey can you not
squeeze the microphone please okay thank
you
I know it looks soft and squishy but
black I thought I could have bought
these two things for less than eighty
two dollars I believe I wouldn't have
purchased anything else especially as
the lipstick does not smell good I'm
gonna have to contact Beulah and make
sure that we're good on the expiration
of it so I don't know if I am going to
do the beauty lash lucky bag next year I
don't feel like I was ripped off like
last year I didn't use anything out of
the bag I am excited about these two
things so at least I will get use out of
these two things and it is fun it's the
novelty of unboxing it and not knowing
what you're gonna get I didn't get one
of those extra-special lucky bags now
forgotten one I don't expect to get one
in the future so we'll see you think I
should Lyla what do you think about this
box you think that it was worth eighty
two dollars yeah yeah you do well this
the shuttle you got two really good
products and then you and then it's fun
oh yeah okay well there you go I think
that's fair enough
so I hope you enjoyed this lucky bag I'm
bagging definitely not as sad as it has
been in previous years so that's a good
thing if you enjoyed this make sure you
subscribe button down below I'm gonna go
get her some coffee and put these guys
to bed soon and I'd love to you oh we
gotta say it together you guys ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
