John I'm not ready but I'm not ready to
see yet I'm ready to see it from nude
sticks and it is whoa it looks like a
let's see a blur pencil cool that sounds
interesting
a blur pencil and I don't know what this
is maybe a sharpener yes a sharpen our
cool the last nude six practice that I
got I wasn't a fan I think it was their
mascara I wasn't a fan I do like their
packaging though the packaging is cool
all right John won't you pick something
to pull out this one right here okay
this is the file derma that everyone
seems to have gotten I tried really hard
to resist and not look at other peoples
lucky bags but I had to look I couldn't
resist okay so this is the Bioderma I
love this stuff I have a full-size
thankfully and I will definitely be
using this it's a fantastic makeup
removing Clint face cleansing product
it's awesome all right Lila pull
something else out what is that let's
see okay what is it Lila by Becca and
this says I have been looking at this
palette for so long and because of the
price point I have not invested in it
I'm so excited that I got the Becca
hombre Rouge eye palette look how
beautiful it is I have almost bought
this a couple of times and I haven't
bought it and I'm so excited this is a
huge win for me I'm so so excited yay
okay what else John take something out
buddy what's next what's that okay
something little and it's by Kevin
aplomb
who is one of my favorite makeup brands
who the brand is one of my favorite
makeup brands I should say and let's see
what it is it is the creamy glow let's
see what that is I'm glad it's not the
bronzing powder because I already have
that let's see in tris Ben and I can't
get it open
there it is
let's see what this is I love this
packaging it's so pretty
whoo it looks like it's a cream of blush
who's so pretty I wanna put my finger in
it
ooh so pretty I know you can't really
see but it's really pretty and I'm very
excited about it yeah yeah
having the Kwan cream blush with Lulu
all right Lila what is that
okay can I help
it's like getting a present you my I
paid for it
it's the bye bye pores pressed and I'm
so so so excited to get it this is a
wonderful lucky bag I feel very lucky
indeed very very lucky box all right
let's see okay and this I am super
excited but now I don't have large pores
but I've heard this is a fantastic
finishing finishing powder but I'm so
excited it's got like an RZ kind of
packaging it's beautiful what do you
think oh cool it keeps it cool all right
last thing in here it's the Wayne Goss
brush sad this is the brow set it's
probably the least interesting of all of
products there's some stuff underneath
let's say looks like it's just paper
underneath just paper
all right what now that's empty all
right let's open this up this is it says
handcrafted in kimono Japan for the
softest natural hair bristles
exclusively on Beauty lish and I'm a
huge Wayne Goss fan and I got away in
gosh brush and my lucky bag last year
and I still use it I still love it it's
in competition with one my Sigma brushes
but do you really like it it's the Wayne
Goss number 20 brush it's amazing
alright so this is kind of less exciting
as far as Wayne Goss goes because these
are pretty basic tools I'm hoping that
for some how this is a magical spoolie
like it's a spoolie how amazing can a
spoolie be but I'm not gonna judge it
yet I'm not gonna judge it same thing
with the brow brush II died and the
eyelash comb brow comb thing it's going
and then there's an angled liner brush
or brow brush here I'm not super excited
about this even though it's Wayne gossip
I wouldn't rather gotten one Wayne Goss
brush that wasn't these than three like
this but I'm still very very thankful I
still want to use them so overall lucky
bag we got will you hold them when I
when I get them alright here we go so
they got meet Wayne Goss brush set
we got me it cosmetics bye bye pores not
being Cavanaugh Quan cream blush here
John you can look at this one look you
can hold the Bioderma remain the Becca
hombre eyeshadow palette this is worth
way more than $75 I mean I'm super super
excited I mean things that I've always
wanted to try this was a fantastic bag I
seriously like I'm so thankful for the
things that I got I definitely will be
getting a lucky bag next year if I can
manage it I did announce it on all of my
