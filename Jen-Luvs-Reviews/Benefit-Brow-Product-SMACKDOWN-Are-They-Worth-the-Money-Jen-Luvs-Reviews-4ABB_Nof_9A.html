just watch a lot of YouTube videos
you've probably seen benefits brow
products they've released them I guess
it was maybe a year ago or so they
revamp tall of their brow products
they're kind of pricey so what I wanted
to do today is I wanted to show you all
of the benefit brow products that I have
for you and give you some many reviews
on every single one of them so you can
decide whether you want to buy any of
them or all of them probably not all of
them but to figure out which ones are
right for you so that sounds good hang
tight we're getting into it right now
before I start this video I do want to
let you know that all of these products
were sent to me by benefit at one point
or another except for the Cobra which I
purchased at full price at Sephora other
than that they were all sent to me I
don't have two of the products one of
them I've never tried in the other one I
can't seem to find so I can tell you a
little bit about the browsing eyebrow
shaping kit but I've never tried the
precisely my brow eyebrow pencil that's
the only one that I haven't tried but I
have everything else from the benefit
brow line here to talk about well
constructive criticism Kelly okay I know
that I have said in a video previous to
this that I am no longer going to review
foundations concealers that are not
inclusive and my reason behind that is
that I don't want to review something
that a good chunk of my audience can't
use so the products that I'm reviewing
today I feel are pretty inclusive for
shade range the only people I feel like
are pretty excluded from this or
redheads benefit does not do a good job
in catering to redheads but I feel like
the majority of the people that watch my
videos are going to be able to benefit
no pun intended from this video and I
that's why I'm doing it so Kelly I you
know I get where you're coming from as
far as the shade range for benefits
complexion products but I'm not going to
be reviewing complexion products today I
would not choose to review benefits
complexion products because of the lack
of Shea
range so let's go ahead and get into the
first brow product right now which is
the one that I don't have which is the
brow Zing's eyebrow shaping kit so this
is the picture of the eyebrow shaping
kit I found it to be a little bit
difficult to use and it was definitely
one of my least favorite products in
their line there are just so many really
good brow powders out there us sahajiya
makes a really good one the ball makes a
great one this one I felt like it didn't
fill in my brows the way I personally
like my brows filled in my brows have a
big space right here and there they're
just kind of sparse they just really
just need filled in but I've got a
really nice guideline of brows to fill
in so they're not super difficult to
fill in but they definitely need to be
filled in in order to look like they're
our full brows but this one I didn't
feel like filled my brows and
effectively I also didn't really like
the brow wax that was in it very much
that I liked one of their other products
better that we're gonna get into in a
second so this one for me didn't work
great but if you have a trick of how you
use this product and it works really
well for you make sure you leave that in
the comment section down below
this is another one that I don't like at
all this is the Bravo conditioning
primer I don't really get this product
it is it's nutrient-rich primer for
fuller looking brows I use this
religiously for a while and I didn't see
and my brows looking fuller all they did
was feel wet and I'm not into paying
what is this $28 for making my eyebrows
wet it didn't it didn't do anything for
me let me show you the tip applicator
here and then what you do is you crank
it up and the product comes out it's
just I mean it didn't do anything for me
I don't know it just seemed like kind of
a useless product for me that's just my
opinion again if you have better
experience with these products leave it
in the comments below so I can learn
from you
moving from my least favorite products
to one of my favorite products I love
this thing okay this is the highbrow
crayon I hardly ever hear anybody
talking about this it is very pink tone
though so if you don't like a pink tone
on your brow unfortunately this isn't
going to be for you I would love it if
they would make different tones of this
they did like a yellow tone if they did
some deeper tones things like that would
be wonderful
so let me show you how this looks I'm
just gonna put it right here and it's
very very beautiful I do feel like
anybody of any skin tone depth wise can
use this because you do blend it out
unless you're very very fair if you're
very very fair it may be too dark for to
give you a highlighting effect that's
the only people I don't think this would
work for but I'm telling you it is
absolutely beautiful actually let me go
ahead and put it on even though my brows
could definitely use some work I'm gonna
go ahead and put it on right now and
kind of blend it out with my fingers
just to kind of show you and in case
you're curious about my eye look it's
the new the crayon case box of crayons I
shout out that I'm working on reviewing
so far so good on that but then what I
do is I just go like this and I just
blend it out with my fingertips I know
there's more professional ways to do
this but I'm not professional and I like
the way that that looks isn't that
pretty
I really like it I think that it
definitely does what it's supposed to do
as far as highlighting the brows you can
also put it on the top here to kind of
bring your brow forward and I do do that
sometimes as well and it's just really
really pretty I just I really like this
product this is definitely one of my
favorites it's very creamy and it goes
on very easily but it definitely has a
really nice lasting power as well I've
never noticed that it's fading on me
through the day where it's like weird
Michael like I can definitely see it
throughout the day it looks really
really pretty
so definitely recommend on this one
next is one I just recently talked about
in my monthly favourites video that I
will link below for you this is the
benefit obviously 24-hour brow setter
and it is their brow gel I really like
this stuff a lot I like it a lot like I
said in that video because it doesn't
make my brows crunchy but it does set
them in place it's a paddle brush with
like two mascara wand kind of bristles
on the side and you just brush it
through your brows it is my ideal brow
setting product and that it doesn't have
that strong scent like some of them do
and it sets my brows all day long
without the crunch factor it is awesome
definitely recommend as well on this one
okay we're doing all my favorites right
now this is the corral vie benefit my
biggest complain about this one is the
size is way too small I wish it was
twice the size of this for the price of
it it comes with a cute little brush in
the top and then inside it's a it's a
like a brow pomade inside a brow gel and
I like this better than let's say the
Anasazi a dip brow because it isn't
super pigmented it gives a lighter look
so you can build it up to being super
instagraming it dark and all of that if
you really want to but but yeah I really
like the way that this looks on me
because it gives a more natural look the
way I choose to apply it but I know I
can build it up if I want to and it's
just really nice and it's the packaging
is so cute and I love the brush on the
top I am so happy that I purchased this
one because remember this is the one
that I purchased and I haven't regretted
of the day since I bought it it's really
really nice oh the other thing about it
is that it doesn't travel like I was
saying about some of the brow products
in that favorites video like where you
know they end up traveling and then your
eyebrows are like extended especially
down here and then you just look really
sad and because your eyebrows are just
really long like a clown so no it does
not do that it stays put all day long
and I really like it a lot
just when you thought it was safe with
positive reviews we come up with a
negative point this is a 3d brow tones
this is supposed to be a brow
highlighter and I am gonna put this one
on for you so you can see that it
doesn't do anything maybe it's the wrong
tone I don't know if they make more than
one shade in this but I feel like I
should be able to use the darker one
considering how dark my eyebrows are but
let me go ahead and kind of fluff it in
and I can definitely feel that there's
product there can you tell the
difference between my eyebrows I know I
can't I can't tell any difference at all
I mean I think that this is another one
that I feel like is a kind of useless
product I'm gonna go ahead and put it in
the other side ooh see look so you can
see a little tiny bit right there where
I messed up but it just I mean it gives
a slight more color to the brows maybe a
blonde would really like this but for my
dark brows it doesn't do anything and I
thought it was Athiya brow highlight
maybe I've got it wrong but it's oh no
it doesn't really do anything for me
maybe my eyebrows are just too dark for
it to work for me but it doesn't do
anything definitely not worth it for me
this is another really good one this is
the goof proof brow pencil I really like
this one a lot I would recommend this
most for people that have my thickness
of brows and thicker if you have thinner
Browns you may want to go even though I
haven't tried it yet you may want to try
that precisely my brow pencil instead
because it's really thin kind of like
the Anastasio brow is where this one is
got kind of a teardrop shape and its
really nice I love the shape of it
because it really helps me to sculpt my
brows so I can go like this and take not
like that I can go like this and take
the flat side and define here this is
what I'm wearing on my brows today and
then I can go here and use the rounded
side to curve here and then use the
point to define over here I just really
like the shape a lot it's very creamy I
don't feel that rips out my brow hairs
which is a huge plus for me and it's
just very enjoyable to use if you've
tried the Too Faced chocolate brownie
eye that one's pretty much the same kind
of formula and I just really really like
this a lot it's got the spoolie on the
other side it's just this belief but
it's a nice bully it's an effective
spoolie and it's good it's really really
good
and the final thing is the discontinued
product that they have but I do want to
mention it in case they do bring it back
this is the benefit give me brow and
this was discontinued because people
were using it as mascara it's supposed
to be like a fiber thing where it's got
these little fibers so I guess people
were deciding to use it as mascara and
their eyes we're getting irritate it
so benefit pulled it from the shelves if
you use this if you do have it and you
use it on your brows you should be fine
as long as you don't get it in your eyes
it's not meant for in your eyes it's
meant for your brows I do find that it
does thicken my brows just a little bit
I love the teeny tiny little wand here
because it's really easy for me to get
in to my brows exactly where I want them
and it does have a little bit of a tint
to it so if I only have a little bit of
light pencil then this gives a beautiful
tint to my brows and I really like it a
lot I wish that they would bring it back
because it is a very good product it
makes me happy and I'm sad they had to
pull it because people were using it for
an unintended purpose if you have used
this and you have had a light irritation
and you didn't put it on your lashes I
would love to know about that because
everybody that I've talked to I said
that they have never had any problems
with this using it on their brows I'm
assuming that it's people putting it on
their lashes instead because I haven't
had any problems with this at all
so that is it for my benefit brow
