be reviewing and the benefit they're
real push-up liner now there has been a
lot going on on YouTube over the past
few weeks about this liner now I could
have done this review a week ago but I
decided I wanted to use it like a lot
before I reviewed it because I wanted to
make sure that I had a good solid review
for you now i will tell you i did not
receive this for promotional purposes
they didn't send it to me but i did get
it from my Birchbox points so i did not
pay for it i also did not pay for this
one this one's going to be forgivable a
cuz i figured i earned most of my
Birchbox point combos how about half my
barge box points from people signing up
using my link so i figured i would use
my points to buy one of these for one of
you beautiful people so rules for the
giveaway i will be discussing those in
minute i want to do the review first
though so this is the aerial benefit
push-up liner and the reason why
everyone's talking so much about this is
because this is a very unique product
nothing like this has ever come out to
my knowledge and basically what it is
inside this little tube is a gel formula
and what you do is you click this up in
order to get the product to come out the
top now at the top it's bendy like mushy
top up here it's like a silicone kind of
top who i roll that up way too much I
don't think you can roll back down no
you can't you can't roll it back down
critique number one now this is the
thing about this I watched uh who was it
who i watch i watched on andrea andrea i
will put a link to her video down below
review this now she had some trouble
keeping it thin this came out as like a
true like pinup looking liner on her and
the first time I used it second time I
used it I ended up with a very thick
line as well but after I practiced for a
while I was able to get a thin line and
I'm going to go ahead and show you my
application right now alright so here is
the benefit push-up liner and there is
the tip a nice little close-up now what
you'll see me doing here is applying it
very very softly what I learned
is that you got to just kind of start
very very slowly and just build it up
very slowly because if you go nuts and
you roll it up too much then you end up
with this really thick line that's just
impossible to get off so I'm just kind
of going over it and over until I get
the opacity that I like and now I'm just
kind of winging it up just a little bit
just really getting that outer corner
pulling my skin taut a little bit so
that I can really get that wing now if I
had this to do it again I would make
that wing a little more triangular
instead of as flippy-flippy as it is now
going over to the left side sorry it's a
little bit blurry owes a little too
close to the camera same thing just
going over the line over and over slowly
just building it up I really did find
that was the best way to do this in
order to get the line that I wanted you
know going in full force is just not the
way to go with this liner unless you
want those pinup eyes and winging it up
once again I really like that silicone
tip in order to make the wing it makes
it very easy because it is so pointed
and then here is the final I look and
overall I'm really happy with it if I
had been able to see it this close I
probably would have made it a little
more opaque but overall very happy with
the way this came out it stays on really
really well I think after a really long
day like if I fly this first thing the
morning then I take it off late at night
I do see some of it has come off through
the day it is not the most long wearing
gel liner that I have ever used but that
being said it's the many many many many
many hours after i have used it that i
do see that we're so you're using it for
a typical workday typical school day
you're gonna be fine i do not recommend
this for people that have never used
eyeliner before unless you want to just
start difficult there's some people they
just want to you know do the most
difficult thing first and then once
you've mastered this you can do anything
my friends you can do anything and it
does definitely take some practice to
work with I do actually really like the
way that they've done the point there i
think that it's much better than a hard
point and
I'm really honestly very happy with this
liner ninety-one percent of people said
this eyeliner was long wearing I do
agree it's long wearing I don't think
that it's the most long wearing eyeliner
ever wherever eighty-one percent said it
was waterproof no I wouldn't say that
it's waterproof I would say that it's my
only water resistant but definitely not
waterproof eighty-six percent since that
hug the lash line yeah I would say if
you're good at it if you can get it
there it will hug the lash line if you
can get it there eighty-four percent
eyes looked visibly larger and I do
agree with that as long as you don't
make it too thick because the thicker
the line you use the small your eyes are
going to look so yeah I mean overall
it's a great liner and I'm excited that
I really like the way that it works and
i'm going to be using it a lot let me
