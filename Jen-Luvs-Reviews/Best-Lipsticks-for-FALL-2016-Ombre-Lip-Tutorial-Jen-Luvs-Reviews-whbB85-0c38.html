little time and money and lips hello my
friends welcome to my top fall lipsticks
video this is in collaboration with a
ginormous group of people who have all
gathered together for the love of makeup
in a facebook group called Beauty and
the vlog if you've never listened to
beauty in the vlog it is an amazing
podcast for YouTube video creators who
are looking for some tips and some
tricks for how to grow their YouTube
channel i was interviewed on it a few
months ago and it was a fantastic
experience erica vieira the host of the
show became a good friend of mine now i
am part of her facebook group and we are
all doing this gorgeous fabulous
collaboration together even if you don't
make youtube videos it's really
interesting to hear the inner workings
of how the backstage stuff happens with
youtube so i recommend it for not just
video creators but for anybody really
that's interested in beauty videos in
general so without further ado let's
talk about my favorite lipsticks for
fall so a big huge trend right now is
ombre lips and that's what I have on my
lips today so i have to ombre
combinations for you but you can wear
these lipsticks alone as well you don't
have to ombre them and i'll show you how
to do it in just a minute but the one
that I'm wearing today is actually color
pop and I really let color pops
lipsticks I feel like they don't have
the best lasting power but they go on
very opaque they're very easy to work
with I don't find that they bleed
however other people tell me that they
bleed into fine lines I personally
haven't had that problem so I can't
speak to it but the ones I use today are
hype girl and grunge and I'm crossing my
fingers that they're still available if
they're not I will put some alternatives
in the description below but it's just
like this peachy color in the center and
then brown on the outside and it just
reminds me of fall leaves and things and
it's just really pretty and I really
like this combo a lot the next combo
that I want to show you is the bare
minerals combo that I love the most and
it's friendship and health so you put
hemp in the middle and then you put
friendship on the outside squeeze your
lips
gather and kind of rub it a little bit
you can also do friendship all over the
lips and then just pop hemp in the
middle for a more subtle ombre effect
both of them just absolutely gorgeous
really really really nice combination
this formula is my new Holy Grail I'm
ready to admit it I'm ready to let the
ofra ones go I'm ready to part with them
I do love the upper ones I still love
the upper ones but I like these better
if you like liquid lipsticks that are
more comfortable that are less drying
but may not have like the super staining
amazing 40 hour where like these are not
going to give you 40 outerwear okay
they're probably going to give you a
good solid six hour where before they
start getting a little funky but in that
six hours you will look super fab and
you'll be super comfy so you just want
to apply them out again after a long day
they do last through eating they don't
technically dry down but if you blot off
the excess you'll still have a nice
stained effect which is really beautiful
i love love love love love this formula
i do have a full review on the whole
bare minerals genuine i will link that
down below another color that's really
really popular in fall is bright red
this is my favorite bright red lip right
now of it's still available i have a
couple others but they're not so
available this one is called Bloody Mary
and it's by next I featured this in my
Pat McGrath lip kit dupe video this is a
dupe for venom one by Pat McGrath it is
a gorgeous red lip just so gorgeous it
does have a tiny bit of a pink undertone
like a berry pink undertone so it's not
a true red but I really love it with the
berry undertone I think it's absolutely
beautiful and perfect for fall and the
last one I wanted to tell you about is
one by two face and this one is a
classic it's called melted chihuahua it
comes in the two-faced holiday set this
is actually not the one from Holly set
this is one that I already have but it
is a deluxe sample size and I just
really really love melted Chihuahua I
think it's a beautiful shade for someone
that's looking for more of a nude tone
to their lips more of like a pinky your
lips but better a kind of shade but it
still has some warmth to it some depth
to it and I really
like the shade a lot I think it's
absolutely gorgeous and very on trend
for fall so those are my top favorite
fall lipsticks for fall of 2016 I hope
