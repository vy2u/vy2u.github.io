hello my friends welcome to my 2015
makeup favorites video this is in
collaboration with a lot of my good
friends that work with me on what's up
in makeup which is my makeup news a show
i'll be linking all of their channels
and videos down below if you'd like to
see some other suggestions of best
makeup products of the year all of these
women are fabulous they know what
they're talking about about makeup they
know all the latest releases they try
things out on their channels so they are
very very knowledgeable about what is
good and what is not good and they will
not waste your money I guarantee it
they're some of my best best friends on
YouTube and I know that you will love
them if you go over to their channel so
I'm gonna like all their videos down
below let's go ahead and get into my
personal favorites of 2015 now I didn't
choose any of these products lightly I
didn't force it i didn't make sure that
I you know I didn't just pick something
just because i needed a face powder you
know what i mean i went through my
collection and I was like okay what are
some of the best things that I tried
this year that I can recommend and I put
no other limits on myself other than
just making sure i showed you the best
of the best products that i tried this
year and i tried a lot of products that
she want to talk to you about the it
cosmetics CC cream this is a your skin
but better CC cream SPF 50 this is my
favorite foundation of the year i do
consider CC creams and BB creams kind of
like foundations and that you put them
all over your face they're a base AKA a
foundation like the foundation of a
house i didn't find any Foundation a
foundation these foundations that stood
out to me this year so the CC cream is
definitely going to be it for me now
this did not come out in 2015 actually
came out in the middle of 2014 but I
discovered it in 2015 it is a beautiful
beautiful foundation in my opinion it
gives a nice look to the skin a definite
light to medium coverage which is what I
personally enjoy never looks cakey long
long long wear time on this plus you get
the skin benefits of the anti-aging
serum that is in this of course I
haven't seen any benefits i haven't used
this for a long period of time enough
like religiously to see you any kind of
anti
benefits I'm just trusting that the
ingredients in here have been tested and
that they are giving me some kind of
anti-aging benefit but i love the
application of this i love the way that
it looks is just so so gorgeous and
makes me so so happy every time I use it
I know when I get ready on periscope the
pair of loves absolutely love this when
I got it they got so excited like you
have to use the it cosmetics CC cream
and I did and it definitely lived up to
the hype it's a wonderful wonderful
product and i highly recommend it my
shade is medium so definitely if you are
a true medium skin tone medium will
probably be too late for you go a little
bit darker if you can or concealer I
don't think it's going to be a surprise
anybody that watches my channel
especially my pair of loves that watch
me get ready on periscope and people
that have been watching my what's in my
face videos for what's up and makeup
that I have exclusively on whatsapp and
makeup calm this is the bare minerals
bear multitasking SPF 20 concealer in
summer bisque I got this in a beauty
like mystery bag from bareMinerals a lot
of the things they put in that bag were
discontinued items that if they were
trying to get rid of this is something
they're not trying to get rid of it is a
wonderful wonderful concealer you can
see in the application hear that how
easily it goes on I do get asked all the
time whether this will be good for dry
eyes and a dry under eyes and I honestly
I had not vouch for it for that I do
have normal skin so I can't vouch for it
but you can look up reviews on YouTube
and see I have heard from my friends
here on YouTube that it does not crease
on them and then it does not have
problems on dry under eyes people have
absolutely raved about this I've never
heard anybody complain about this
product it is just a wonderful under-eye
concealer it was a shock to me that it
worked because it's a powder formula I
couldn't imagine that a powder formula
would have this kind of coverage but it
really does if I didn't do makeup videos
on YouTube I would probably only
purchase this for the rest of my life it
is absolutely amazing right for
eyeshadow primer this year I discovered
a new eyeshadow primer recently this is
eden by urban decay it is such a
wonderful wonderful eye shadow primer
last year in my favorites I highlighted
the anti-aging primer which I still
still love but what I love that Eden as
it does mute out discoloration it does
have the doe foot applicator in the new
packaging just so you know and then when
you
on it gives you that opaque look which I
really love as a base for shadow to mute
out this coloration so that I can really
start with that white canvas that blank
sheet of paper so that my eye look goes
on smoothly and seamlessly and I don't
have to worry about my natural eye color
shade my skin shade interfering with my
eye look so this is a definite recommend
it keeps my eye shadow on all day long
and it's just a wonderful wonderful
product highly recommend this one every
time I keep talking about periscope and
I get ready on periscope all the time
and my friends over there they always
remind me there's always a few of them
to remind me don't forget your lip mask
because I always forget to put it on but
this is something that has absolutely
saved my lips and it definitely gets my
lips ready for lip products so somewhere
in the middle of my makeup routine when
I start getting ready i put on my bite
beauty agave lip mask now this one is
the maple version this was sent to me by
my friend Shannon from Canada you can't
get this in the States but you can get a
lot of other versions of the bite beauty
lip mask in the States and i definitely
recommend this though number one
ingredient list in this is lanolin which
is what they use for nursing mothers
when they're ok let's just see this it's
used for nursing mothers when they're in
pain from the nursing process I won't go
into any more detail than that that's
what most really lanolin I've seen used
for but they use this in the bite beauty
lip mask as the number wedding I really
feel like this makes a huge difference
in my lips and in how soft my lips are I
have chronically dry lips all year long
in the wintertime it gets really bad and
this really has saved my lips this
winter and i highly recommend this
product my favorite formula of the year
that i discovered was the buxom I
shadows I actually got these as FC point
perks and I'm so so so thankful tipsy
that they had these as point perks these
shades were picked out by the Ipsy
stylist I forget which ones I get them
all confused but I did put them together
myself as far as the order you can buy
these individually and then you fill up
your pallet or they have pre-fill pals
but this formula is absolutely amazing
you can see in the eye look that you're
looking at right now this is was created
with these pallets and the eyeshadows
are just so buttery smooth
so buttery smooth so easy to blend so
long wearing I mean everything you could
possibly want in an eyeshadow that's
what you're getting with these shadows
here I mean just a wonderful wonderful
product and I definitely highly
recommend it the matte shades are
fantastic the shimmer shades are
fantastic everything about these shadows
I can honestly say is fantastic and I'm
sewing so impressed with this formula
and buxton does not tend to be one of my
favorite brands so I'm really excited to
go to recommend to you a product from
buxom that totally is absolutely amazing
go ahead and move on to another
eyeshadow palette that I love I'm not
going to spend too much time on it
because I don't believe it's available
anymore but it's the kat von d maybe a
loca palette if you were looking for
some bright eye shadows this is
definitely a phenomenal eyeshadow
palette for bright colors you've got
some nice I mean I think that anybody
designing a bright eyeshadow palette
should take a note of what they did for
this palette they not only get us give
us bright colors but they also gave us
some neutral colors in order to balance
out the look so it's not just me on in
your face this is an extremely workable
Universal palette we can create
unlimited looks with this palette I mean
it's just unbelievable but I'm going to
go ahead and get off of that because I
don't think that you can get this
anymore but if you were able to get it
or if you can find it anywhere I
definitely recommend picking this up Kat
Von D now has her own website where she
calls it old-school products I'm hoping
that this will appear at some point on
her website for sale as an old-school
product so definitely keep your eye out
on Kat Von D beauty calm for eyeliner
this was another shocker for me this is
the gel eyeliner by essence this is the
one of the best gel eyeliners I've ever
used it is so smooth so creamy so easy
to go on doesn't flake through the day
and it's blackity black black black it
is so black so black and it just goes on
so smoothly and it doesn't seep into
fine lines or anything if you have that
problem with like liquid eyeliners or
pen eyeliners that it seeps into your
fine lines this will not do that at
least I don't think that it will because
of the gel consistency versus the liquid
consistency it goes on just so so
smoothly you do want to get a very fine
pointed brush for this you can get a
flat angled brush that's very fine or
get a pointed like the one that i'm
using with a pointed angle brush that
one is from tart but essence does make a
an angled I'm not sure what's angled but
essence does make an eyeliner brush that
does go with this and I've heard that it
is absolutely wonderful so definitely
check into this this is very inexpensive
you can get in essence products at Ulta
and I do believe you can get them online
as well but I'm not a hundred percent
sure about that so I always get mine
ulta this one I actually got my
generation Beauty swag bag and I'm so so
so thankful it is a wonderful wonderful
gel eyeliner and especially for as
inexpensive as it is I do not think that
any other high-end gel eyeliner will
beat this may be the same but definitely
not beating it I can't imagine a gel
eyeliner performing better than the way
that this one performs it's absolutely
amazing alright for mascara this year I
could not pick my favorite mascara my
favorite mascaras have all been
drugstore mascara with the exception of
one and I do want to show you all of
them not going to go into super detail
about all of them the one that I use
today was the I Heart extreme mascara by
essence this is a wonderful mascara i
have not had any flaking or clumping or
anything with this it is so inexpensive
and so wonderful if i have any critique
about this it's the size of the one the
one so lutely huge so if you have small
eyes this may be difficult to work with
but the formula is really really really
wonderful goes on just so well separates
the lashes out and just gives length and
volume and everything you could possibly
want in mascara it's wonderful some
other another drug store one that really
blew me away this year was the
Maybelline lash sensational same thing
just a really wonderful mascara I do
feel like this separates my lashes out a
bit more the wand is definitely smaller
and it's also a rubber bristles so if
you like that rebel rubber bristle then
this one would be the one that I
recommend or if you have smaller eyes
this would be the one that I would
recommend but if you do have large your
eyes and you like the brush you know the
synthetic plasticky like brush kind of
wands then this is this would be the one
that I would recommend for you but both
of them I like them equally I had to use
one of my eyes so I chose this one but
they both they both perform very very
very well high-end mascaras the steal a
huge mascara is a new one for me I abs
it's got the same kind of wand as the
better than sex mascara by Too Faced
it's really really nice mascara I do
feel like it performs better than the
better than sex by Too Faced I feel like
it gives me really huge lashes like
thickness and volumizing and just the
length it gives you everything I would
say this is more of a volumizing mascara
than a lengthening mascara but only by a
touch only by a hair hahaha but it's
just really good it's really really good
and I haven't seen very many people talk
about this but it's a wonderful
wonderful mascara this isn't enough
sample size by the way but um you know
oh I would purchase a full size of this
definitely definitely the next up was
another palette that was a huge surprise
to me and that is the elf contour
palette last year the Smashbox contour
palette was my contour palette of the
year this elf palette is an exact duplex
palette except for you get one
additional shade which is this one right
here I'm going to go ahead and show you
the application of this contour shade on
my cheeks I mean it just goes on so
flawlessly so amazingly it's so easy to
work with if you're not used to
contouring I definitely recommend
picking up this contour palette it is so
wonderful I know that they now have a
cream contour palette I haven't tried
that one yet but I can definitely vouch
for the powder products I didn't use the
highlight today but the highlight is
also amazing so this contour shade
blends so super easily and is a very
neutral shade I'm finding with a lot of
pallets that come out there contour
pallets they're not neutral shades they
tend to lead toward the warm side but
when you think about a shadow shadow is
neither warm nor cool it's just a
neutral color when you think of natural
shadows so when you have a contour shade
you really need a neutral shade and this
is definitely a neutral shade it is so
beautiful so easy to work with and
highly highly recommend for very very
inexpensive I definitely like this
better than a lot of my highest palettes
ione anastacio on the kat von d I own
some other contour pals from high-end
brands this is definitely my favorite
contour palette that I've discovered the
show we're talking about contouring
let's talk about highlighting
highlighting Laura Geller's gilded honey
was the highlight
as my highlight of the year followed
very closely by the ofra blush stripes
illuminating I feel like this is just a
touch more my favorite this is a newer
purchase for me compared to the o fry I
got this over one in my generation
beauty swag bag and I got this one about
two or three weeks after that but this
is such a beautiful highlight you can
see the application of it there it's
just so glowing and gorgeous this is not
a subtle highlight if you're looking for
a subtle highlight you're not getting
that with this this is so beautiful
amazing where time is a very long time
and it gives you that really bright glow
on your cheeks I do want to talk about
though the illuminating brush blush
stripes this one is really nice as
universal for many many different skin
tones I mean you can see you have this
very deep shade of a highlight here for
deeper skin tones I have used this on my
eyes once or twice it's gorgeous but I
can't use it on my cheeks is too deep
but these shades here i can definitely
all use on my cheeks and i have used
them all you have some subtle shades
like this pink or shade here and then
some brighter shades down here you can
mix them all together it's just a very
Universal highlight palettes oh really
and truly in my heart these Thai but I
had to use one on my cheeks I had to
choose one so I chose the Laura Geller
gilded honey all of them are just both
of them are beautiful both of them are
amazing I think you'll be happy with
either purchase and then finally for lip
products again I couldn't choose a
particular color of lip product I'm just
going to say colour-pop lip products are
my favorite lip product of the year I
just I love them all and you know color
pop gets a bad rep for their liquid
lipsticks because they are so drying and
they are drawing I'll tell you that I'll
straw you that straight up they are
drying but if you can get over that if
you're okay with that like I'm okay with
it I'm okay with it I'm totally okay
with not wearing one of the colour-pop
liquid lipsticks today i'm wearing the
two-faced melted chocolate and chocolate
honey because of the color of my shirt I
wanted it to match and I don't really
have any color pop liquid lipsticks that
I thought would match or even the lip
products I just I felt like this would
just be perfect to match my outfit
that's the only reason why I'm wearing
it today but I do want to show you the
application of the new shade by it's my
ray ray called stingray it just goes on
so so opaque so so
smoothly on you definitely want to prep
your lips with some kind of moisturizer
before you use it I think that's really
really important with these you can
leave a lip balm on underneath but
you're not going to get the lasting
power you would get without a lip balm
underneath you can also apply a lip balm
over top of it to give you some moisture
so you're going to lose that matte
effect but I feel like it's totally
worth it for the beauty of the shades
for the lasting power even with a lip
balm is very very very good and then
I'll take away any flakiness that the
product may have had when you didn't use
a lip balm I don't mind doctoring these
because they're so are so inexpensive
and because they're the shades are
beautiful and I'm so so in love with
that also I wanted to tell you about
their lippie stix the lippie Stix are
also wonderful I feel absolutely
ridiculous saying we're lippie Stix but
they're really really wonderful some of
my favorite shades are Lumiere bound and
the new one razor these are all just
wonderful but really you just have to
pick the shades that call to you look at
swatches online they have beautiful
swatches on the colour-pop website and I
definitely recommend them I'm not
sponsored by color pop I'm not affiliate
with them in any way they've never sent
me a product for review these are all
things that I've purchased myself so
this is a completely completely I mean
even when I get things that to me it's
completely unbiased but I just want to
make sure you know that I did pay for
these outright because I know that
matters to some people another liquid
lipstick I wanted to recommend before I
go is the ofra liquid lyst lipstick
specifically in angeles this is such an
amazing shade I never wear this on its
own this is a lip shade that what I do
and I'll show you the way that I used it
with razor as I pop it in the center of
my lips and then i blend it out and it
really makes my lips look more full it
gives it that light highlight shade in
the middle and it's so easy to do people
think that when you're highlighting and
contouring that it's going to be
something difficult to do this is
definitely not something difficult to do
you just pop pop and then blend it a
little bit with your finger and you're
done it's really easy and angeles is
just a wonderful shade to give you an
entire new set of lipstick so if you
have any lip shades that you feel are a
little too dark not quite wearable for
you put angeles over top and you will
have a completely new lip shade I really
feel like Oprah needs to market this as
a transforming lips
and they would make a million dollars
off of it because it is such a magical
shape and I would repurchase this and
repurchase this and repurchase this over
and over and over and over again it's
just such a wonderful interesting
product and I definitely recommend that
you get this in your collection so that
is my 2015 favorites video I hope that
you enjoyed it I hope you got some great
products to take with you and to kind of
