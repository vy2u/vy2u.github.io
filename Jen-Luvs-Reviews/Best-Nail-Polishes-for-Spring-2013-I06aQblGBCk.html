very first exclusively nail polish video
woohoo nail polish lovers I have nine
nail polishes for you that I have found
that I love for spraying i have a brand
new nail polish addiction i am not
showing you all the nail polishes i have
bought in the last couple of months i'm
just showing you the ones that i like
for spring let's just cut right to the
chase and gets these polishes now first
off I just signed up for a julep
subscription and um my friend grace had
set me bless her soul she had sent me a
julep box to try a few months ago just
because she's amazing and I could not
sign up on her anyone elses link but
grace is because she just was so kind to
send me a free box once and it was like
I couldn't not use her link so if you
had julep link and I didn't use yours
that's why I didn't use it i'm sorry but
i happen to really like the polishes
that i have gotten so let me show you
the two that i just got this month that
i love the first one is called Julia and
I paid an extra five dollars for this
one and it was so worth it this is going
to be my perfect Baltimore Ravens color
for next fall but for now I'm going to
be wearing it in the spring this this
bottle does not do it justice let me
show you how beautiful that is it is a
true purple with gold glitter and that
is two coats my friends two coats and it
is that that opaque I was amazed by this
polish so overly worth any i mean i
would pay fifteen dollars just for this
polish I mean it is just insanely
beautiful so I am really really happy
with this one and this I will probably
have to repurchase this because I'm
assuming i will run out of this okay the
next one I got this month was is called
Robin and it is a blue robin's egg blue
show you that one and it's
just a beautiful flat blue I did not use
any top coats over any of these just so
you can see the true color of them but
yeah loving this color as well now down
to drugstore I have a bunch of Sally
Hansen polishes because I happen to love
the formula Sally Hansen polishes this
one is a complete salon manicure I have
had hits and misses with this formula
sometimes they're extremely sheer this
one happens to be nice and opaque and
this one is in I pink I can and it is
here and I won't stick up my
inappropriate finger but that is that is
what that looks like and it is just a
bright baby pink this one is an extreme
where Sally Hansen color and it is in
fuchsia power yeah just a bright bright
bright pink another extreme where color
and I got these for two dollars at
walgreens they were on sale and I don't
like doing thumb swatches but I was
running out of fingers oh wait this is
it mint sorbet I really wanted to MIT
polish because MIT polishes are so in
right now and so that is the crane my
arm around so you can see my thumb
there's that one just a gorgeous
gorgeous mint green next up I fell in
love with coral again Emily no well who
I adore had a video on coral makeup and
I just was like oh my gosh i bought
everything coral now so I've actually
bought two coral nail polishes recently
this one is the ummat Sally Hansen
extreme we're in coral reef and that's
what that little blog and then while I
was at Whole Foods the other night I
could not resist because shanny banny
you don't know she and vania i will link
her down below had an amazing Zoya
polish haul she I guess gets products
from Zoya she got every polish in their
new line and just gorgeous gorgeous
colors of like you know what I'm going
to buy his way and nail polish because
they're just incredibly beautiful she
had some hits and some misses and I was
hoping this one was going to be ahead
and it was and this one is in poppy show
you what that one is
and this one I really like because it is
uniquely satiny it's got a really pretty
satin color that none of the other
polishes I'm showing you today have and
it just it's beautiful it's got kind of
a goldish tinge to it it is a little
more orangie than this one here than the
sally hansen but just a true coral
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous color and
would definitely recommend this that is
two coats there it really only needed
one coat but I like to put two coats
anyway just for staying power and
because I just think it looks better if
I do the next one is a combo this sinful
colors one is very very sheer I put two
coats of this and then one coat of this
because sometimes I really like to do a
little bit of sheer stuff going on this
one's called badly missed all of these
sinful color pouches I have three of
them that have this iridescent shine to
them they are all very very sheer so
don't expect that to get this color out
of the bottle but I put this and then I
put this one here I love this one this
is the i miss you this glitter is
beautiful let me show you what that
combo looks like i can get my phalanges
wrapped around these things and again
you can see how sheer this one is over
here and this is very sheer you're not
going to get nope a color out of that
either but sometimes I kind of like a
little more with subtle look on my nails
so that works for me for spring and the
last one is another sinful colors and
this one's in boom boom and that's what
that looks like and this one is really
beautiful with the pink glitter that I
just showed you over top as well so that
is my spring nail polish recommendations
that I don't have every polish that
exists but of the publishers that I
bought those have been my favorite for
spring so far I'm sure you will see many
more polishes in favorites throughout
the spring and summer from me so make
