the products that I got at generation
beauty in my gigantic swag bag there
were ton of videos on the swag bag that
if she gave out at the generation Beauty
creators event on Friday night four
generation Beauty in New York City of
2015 that was the event and it was
probably I would dare to say a thousand
dollars worth of products in here I mean
it was full to the brim bulging like
probably 20 pounds of stuff in this bag
and what I wanted to do today was show
you the best products that I got in my
swag bag so you wouldn't know whether
these were good products for you to go
out and purchase so let's go ahead and
get started first thing I want to talk
about is the Marc Anthony hydrating
coconut oil and shea butter shampoo and
conditioner I am obsessed obsessed with
these these are drugstore price they're
probably a little bit higher than like a
typical drugstore I think these run
about eight or nine dollars apiece maybe
$8 seven eight dollars apiece something
like that on ulties website Ulta
recently had a sale on this brand so I
went nuts and I got every shampoo in
their line because I loved it so much I
was like you know what I want to be in
shampoo for the next three years like I
got them all and it's because when I get
to know a brand and a brand consistently
performs well I become extremely brand
loyal and that's basically what's
happened with me with Marc Anthony
I've tried their hairspray I have tried
their dry shampoo I have tried now these
and I am obsessed everybody keeps asking
me Jenna how in the world does your hair
still look red after you got died two
months ago if I swear it's because it
has to be because of the shampoo it's a
sulfate free shampoo it's
rehydrating if you look at the
ingredients the number one ingredient is
water the net and there's no alcohol in
here scent Ramon iam chloride alright so
I just looked up the ingredients quick
google search and learned a little bit
about these things so the number one
ingredient in the conditioner is water
the second ingredient is something
called scent Ramon iam chloride and when
I look that up that its major job is to
decrease frizz in the hair this I found
to be a pretty average conditioner it
was this the shampoo that I am extremely
impressed with now it says sulfate free
when I looked up the ingredient olefin
sulfonate it's kind of a cousin of
sulfates but all I can tell you is that
I got my hair dyed two months ago and
look how red it is still I mean it's
faded a little bit but the proof is in
the red alright I'm feeling like this
probably helped that a lot now without a
control group without having dyed my
hair and not use this I can't say for
100% sure that this is what is keeping
the red in my hair but I'm voting for it
I am rooting for it I'm saying that this
stuff is amazing and it smells amazing
it feels amazing it does a lot of
sulfate free shampoos don't lather up
but because it has that cousin of a
sulfate in there it does lather up just
not quite as much as a typical sulfate
overall just amazing amazing amazing
product next up is one that all of my
friends on periscope are in love with
I'm in love with it the it cosmetics CC
cream this is the your skip a better CC
cream I am wearing it on my face today I
can tell you it is a little more
coverage then let's say a BB cream but I
wouldn't say it's as medium coverage as
a foundation it's kind of somewhere
between light and medium not quite light
not quite medium somewhere in between
there as far as the coverage my shade is
ironically medium it definitely matches
my skin tone perfectly and it is
wonderful it lasts a very long time on
the skin I wouldn't say all day but a
very long time on the skin and it just
makes my skin look amazing I do have
normal skin so it doesn't take a whole
lot for it to look pretty flawless but I
will say that this is definitely one of
my favorite
foundation any kinds of product that I
have ever used it is wonderful while
we're talking about it Cosmetics let's
talk about the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye with collagen vitamins C and K
shade here is neutral medium this is an
extremely opaque concealer I've heard it
does not work as well on under eye
wrinkles and things like if you have
creasing under your eyes I've heard this
can accentuate creasing just so you know
I have not had that problem with it
it is extremely thick so you only need
the time is a little bit on your eyes in
order for this to work it really is a
wonderful concealer I can't say anything
else better about it it just is a
fantastic concealer the next brand that
I kind of discovered through generation
Beauty is essence essence is a hidden
gem that I had no idea what I was
missing
now essence is sold at Ulta it is on the
drugstore sided it's the cheaper end of
the drugstore side the best thing I
discovered where the essence mascaras
this is the lash princess mascara oh my
goodness I am wearing it today and I
have short very sparse just nothing
lashes when I'm not wearing mascara you
can't see my lashes let me see if I can
get close-up kind of show you what I've
got going on oh yeah that's some lashes
there girlfriend that's some lashes
uh-huh so this is an amazing mascara no
flaking no clumping well it clumps a
little bit now that it's a little older
when I first got it it didn't clump a
whole lot but now I'm noticing it's
plumping a little bit just got to wiggle
your brush to get those clump ease out
but where time is wonderful and it's
cheap it's cheap girlfriend and it's
amazing the other one is the gel
eyeliner by essence so this is also
amazing really really wonderful I
compare this to my high-end gel
eyeliners it is wonderful wonderful the
blush that I got this is called the
blush up powder blush and heat wave it's
kind of an ombre look this I'm gonna
looking forward to using in the
summertime I feel like it's a little
bright for right now it doesn't really
match the colors that I've been wearing
but I am going to save this for summer
and I have used it just a little bit and
the wear time on this is pretty it's
okay it's probably to seven hours not an
all-day blush but definitely on most of
the day blush it'll last you do a
workday or school day and then the
eyeshadows I was shocked at how much I
love these eyeshadows because it's a lot
for a drugstore eyeshadow to impress me
and these things are creamy are you
kidding me once what let's do a little
bit this one there do that one nope
what I'm not even I'm not even kidding
here look at this are you kidding
no no kidding creamy creamy creamy
really fun to use I'm not sure about
this palette as a palette by itself but
it's a really nice supplemental palette
for somebody looking for some rays I was
impressed I was impressed so assets as a
whole is a huge win like essence and it
cosmetics where the big standout brands
for me out of this bag okay a brand that
I know that I love I love even more this
is the Ofra blush stripes illuminating
yes yes yes yes yes yes
thanks to generation Beauty I did make a
connection with Oprah and I am going to
be doing a brand review soon I still am
trying out some of their products but
this is definitely one of the best
highlighters I've ever tried of my life
it's up there with my Becca highlighters
I may even like it more especially since
this product has so many choices in it
it is so good it is so good I have to
show you I have to show you you can use
these individually or you can use them
together
oh just amazing and I thought that it
was incredible that they used shades in
there that will complement any skin tone
right there you see those can you see
that beautifulness and it is a popin
highlight like I have Jacqueline Hills
I have Jacqueline Hill champagne pop and
this compares as far as shine goes
amazing highlight new brand to me
pristiq I have gotten this in
subscription boxes before but I had
never
by this brow product before and I wasn't
like their products never really wowed
me but this product this brow product is
wonderful I love see how it goes on
right here goes on super super light at
first and then as you build it as you
build it it will come up to whatever
color you need it to be I'm gonna get a
real dark for you
BAM so you can use this you can use this
for blonde you can use this for brunette
you can use this probably not for
redheads but anybody else from blonde to
brunette would definitely be able to use
this this is is there any shade in here
I don't know
there's no shade and then in the back
here I just watched a video before this
I didn't realize this was here so I
haven't used it yet I was watching a
video of somebody's on bagging of this
and just to make sure I got all the
products that I wanted to include and
she like open up the back I'm like oh
it's magical
it's got a brow gel in the back I don't
even realize it was there haven't tried
yet we'll be trying it very very soon so
excited that that is there and then two
more things here two more eyeliners this
one I knew was amazing and I still think
that it's amazing this is the Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner it is my holy grail
liquid eyeliner it is I can't say
anything but positive things about this
is the only liquid eyeliner I have ever
used except for the Marc Jacobs blacker
liner that I can keep my wing on all day
long and it will still be there at the
end of the day Kat Von D no Cielo no
every other liquid eyeliner I've ever
tried no Jesse's girl and Marc Jacobs
are the only ones that I could see all
day long this is an amazing liquid
eyeliner and then this one is a new
discovery for me by GA this is the
kitten liner when I first used it it was
this is the which caught this is the
blacker I'd swatch these earlier I was
in what's the makeup chat earlier this
is the blacker and that's the justice
girl here's the GA right there so I mean
they all pretty much do the same thing
when I first broke out the G way the tip
was a little bit stiff but the more I
used it the more I loved it and it is a
wonderful liquid eyeliner one
not quite the same power that the
dusties girl has but overall just a
really really nice liquid eyeliner so
those are the best products I got at
generation beauty of course that bag was
full of stuff but those were like this
standout so the absolute standouts from
the bag that I wanted to share with you
