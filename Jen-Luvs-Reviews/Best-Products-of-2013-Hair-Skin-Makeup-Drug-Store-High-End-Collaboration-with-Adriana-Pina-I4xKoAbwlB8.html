bring you my year-long favorites I kind
of caught you this concept off of Emily
Noelle's 83 emily awards these are the
products that i would say are the best
of the best of my discoveries for 2013
and let me tell you i have bought more
makeup in the past year that i have in
my entire life all combined because of
this new hobby of mine of making beauty
video reviews so i have a lot to show
you and I want to jump right in but
before I do I want to let you know that
this is a collaboration with my friend
Adriana Pina who is amazing I met her on
keek if you don't know what kick is it's
primarily a iphone or a smartphone app
and you can basically it's 36 seven
second video chatting and it is
fantastic so much fun there's a quite a
few of us beauty video creators on there
and we just developed this little
community and everybody is fabulous so I
met Adriana on there and I am so so so
thankful so we decided we were going to
do this video together so if you're
interested in what Adriana's favorites
for this year were go ahead and click
down below she is such a sweetheart and
she is absolutely gorgeous so without
further ado I am going to jump into my
favorites now I am going to start with
hair care skin care and then I'm going
to work my way into makeup items I'm
gonna put a little next button right
there that is going to allow you to skip
to the next item if you are on a desktop
or laptop computer it won't work with
smartphone or iPads things like that but
if you are it'll allow you to skip to
the next item if you are not interested
in the current and them talking about
also put a back button there in case you
want to rewind now the two hair care
products that have changed my life this
movement here the john frieda full
repair full body shampoo and conditioner
i need to re-up on my conditioner but
here is the shampoo this stuff is
wonderful i got this in one of my
subscription boxes and it has seriously
added so much moisture and hydration to
my day
imaged hair I did really have normal
hair but since I diet so much and I
straighten that and do all of that this
is restored life to my hair so love love
love this the other product has been the
macadamia a hair mask and I do this once
or twice a week and this is definitely
increased the shine of my hair increase
the softness of my hair I mean after I
use this I put all over my hair even
though I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
you but I like go like this for like the
whole rest of the day I'm like oh so
soft it's so soft and silky and I do
that all day look I can't even stop you
have used this is my second tub of it
and I just smells so good and it just
works really really well for my hair
I've heard it does not work on oily hair
that it's more for dry to normal hair so
it's worked great for me next up is a
Holy Grail skincare item and this is
actually an old packaging I got this on
sale when they were changing the
packaging from my local drugstore and I
loved it so much I went back and got a
second one and it is the L'Oreal
collagen moisture filler and it says day
but the new one comes in a little tub
and it also is for night as well the
reason why I love this is because the
way that it soaks into my skin I have
never used a moisturizer or any kind of
a cream that absorbs as well as this
there is no oiliness to it at all like
it just feels like it's going on and
then it's gone like it just sucks up
into your skin and it and it's amazing I
just really enjoy this product I can't
speak to the collagen cleans of this but
I do know that it feels amazing it
smells amazing especially in the morning
I just love the smell of it it just kind
of wakes me up and i feel like i could
start my day because of this i'm not
even exaggerating like I don't you love
this product ok so now living on I'm
going to kind of go in makeup order of
how I put everything on so we're gonna
start with face primer and all I have
left is this little teeny tiny one I
used up my full size this is the
professional by benefit it comes out
kind of as my skin color but if you're
darker skin it just blends right and
there's no actual color to it even
though it looks like it and it just
feels so smooth and you'll be able to
see hopefully we have to see where I
applied it and how it just fills in my
pores like crazy it's just a such an
amazing
amazing product this is by far my
favorite primer I've probably bought
seven or eight face primers this year
and this is by far my favorite and i am
just you know savoring these last drops
in trying to avoid buying another one
even though i know i will have to but I
Sony face primers I'm trying to go
through that I don't like as much as
this and I'm kind of as a reward of
finishing my other face primers I'm
going to get myself more of this at some
point last year I did not have a
foundation or a powder that just blew me
away so I was determined this year to
find one that would and I did and it is
the covergirl outlast stay fabulous
three and one foundation and I
absolutely love this stuff I am
completely out of it I did buy some more
high-end foundations and i bought some a
lot of BB creams i got the BB cream
sampler and i'll put my review of that
support BB cream sampler the link to
that down below so you can see what i
thought of those but this still just is
my favorite foundation / BB cream / CC
cream whatever you put on your face even
out your skin tone this is my favorite
of the year it is does not oxidize on my
skin it goes on very smoothly never
looks cakey I mean just love this stuff
just wonderful wonderful formula as far
as face powder this here my Rimmel stay
matte is my favorite face powder of the
year and the reason why this really blew
me away as I've tried quite a few face
powders as well I did buy the mac
mineralize skinfinish for the first time
this year's the first might ever tried
it and I would compare that to this I
it's not an exact do i do think that the
mac performs maybe a slight bit better
as far as the lasting power of it but
for the price difference i don't think
it is worth the price difference this
stuff is amazing and if you watch beauty
videos on youtube you've seen this
talked about a million times but i do
want to tell you that this is definitely
my favorite face powder of the year yay
i use this concealer for slight dark
circles under my eyes the occasional
blemish some redness around my nose a
little redness on my chin occasionally
and it is by the bomb and it is time
bomb and this stuff is wonderful is a
medium to full coverage concealer it is
not the most full-coverage concealer
ever but if you're just looking to do
just some basic
covering of some things that aren't
super noticeable this is a shade lighter
than my skin tone so i use it primarily
under my eyes but it also works for the
redness as well so highly recommend this
and I've never seen this talked about in
a video ever I do want to do a video of
just all of my products from the bomb so
I can tell you about all because i have
a ridiculous amount of the bomb products
i talked about i was going to do this
video a long time ago but i have gotten
around to it but i really want to do it
so this is definitely amazing highly
recommend okay for eyeshadow primer okay
I couldn't pick an eyeshadow primer
because i use this way more than i've
ever used an eyeshadow primer in my life
and this is max Paint Pot in painterly
it is my first paint pot and I use this
every day I have so much trouble
reaching for any of my eyeshadow primers
I have the two-faced one I have the
urban decay of course I have drugstore
versions i have elf one I have a Rimmel
one I have so many eyelid primers and I
reach for this far more than I reach for
other ones because I love the way that
this matches with my skin tone and just
kind of evens out the skin tone on my
eyes it gives it a really nice space for
my shadow to stick to I have never had a
shadow crease on this I feel like it
increases longevity of my shadows and I
just I absolutely love this formula how
easy it goes on never creasing just just
flawless absolutely flawless highly
recommend this if you have never tried
this it is part of their permanent lines
so that is something that is really good
because you know how Mac they always
have things that are limited edition you
don't to worry about that with painterly
all right ladies next up we're talking
about cheeks and contouring and all of
that good stuff for cheeks if I could
own one blush in life unless okay
sometime i will show you my blood storm
i blush drawer is ridiculous I probably
own at least 40 blushes I don't know why
I just have an addiction and it's a
problem but if I had to get rid of all
of my blushes this is the one blush I
would Keith and it is by Kat Von D and
it is in Essex and again I've never
heard anybody talk about this blush and
it is my absolute favorite look how
stinkin gorgeous that is finger swatch
hands watch
for you just beautiful I mean the reason
why I love this shade particularly is
just because of how natural it looks on
my skin it just really um you know there
is no seasons this this has no limits no
season I mean it just goes all the time
everywhere with everything for my skin
tone just love love love love love this
if you happen to run into this in
sephora i suggest you swatch it try it
on it is all just amazing amazing
formula stays all day long like you saw
highly pigmented just amazing formula
and blends really nicely with the
bronzer I'm about to show you which is
hula by benefit love this bronzer oh my
gosh i love this bronzer because of its
contouring ability I don't use this as a
like in the summertime kind of looking
sunny kind of bronzer because I don't
feel like it's good for that I feel like
it's more of a trying to hollow out my
cheeks a little bit I do that whole
three pattern to you know do a little
bit of contouring and this is just
gorgeous i am starting to make a dent in
this which is a huge huge compliment to
this bronzer on my only complaint about
this bronzer is that it is very
sensitive you have to be very gentle
with it but look how just it's just
gorgeous and oh oh can't say enough good
things cannot alright and then for
highlight because of course you can't go
on and on about cheek products without
talking about a beautiful highlight the
most useless makeup product that ever
existed but something that I for some
reason field is completely necessary
it's me mary-lou manizer highlighter by
the bone uh just gorgeous gorgeous
highlight I love this because it is
shimmery but it is not obnoxious there
is no sparkle to it it is just a
champagne shimmer and if you saw my dior
i bought the holiday palette by dior
this was an exact duplicates in the
holiday palette vibe you are on the
exact dupe like there's no didn't know
it's exact and I returned that because I
already have this and I will never go
through this I could use this for 10
years and
never go through this this is just it's
so large and amazing and just oh oh if I
could marry mary lou manizer i would
marry mary lou manizer but unfortunately
she's a fictional character and I
already have a husband all right moving
on to eyes this is not going to be a
shocker i could not pick between these
two pellets I just couldn't but they're
both by the same company / person and
that's kat von d this is my theory about
Kat Von D kat von d before she made
makeup she was a business person she
owns a tattoo shop she cares about
quality when you're doing much my
husband's a tattoo artist and when
you're doing permanent ink on someone it
is really important to have high-quality
you know just product that you're
providing for people and I think that
she brought that into her makeup line I
really genuinely do because a lot of
eyeshadow palettes you will have hits
and misses I especially experience this
with Urban Decay where there will be in
a 20 shadow palette 5 that just
completely suck they're terrible they're
terrible shadows but with kat von d you
don't get a single shadow I have never
had a single kat von d eyeshadow fail on
me ever and I own three pellets by them
but these are the two that i discovered
this year and this one is the ladybird
palette and then this one is the
spellbinding i shadow book and I there's
videos on these I have a video
specifically on this one and why i love
this one this one is all matt the
eyeliner fell out but i'm not care i'm
not talking about the island i'm talking
about the shadows I just blew and then
that one is on Matt and then this one is
a mix of shimmers and mats and just
gorgeous this one I would only recommend
to people who enjoy a lot of color there
is one that she has it is more neutral
tones I'll put the name of that here
that you may be interested in this one
is I see I'm cool tone but this has it
has a cool side and it has a warm side
so this could work for anyone of any
skin tone just a beautiful beautiful
beautiful palette and again highly
pigmented easy to blend just everything
you want in an eyeshadow these pallets
have okay continuing with eyes I have
an eyeliner that i want to show you and
I have absolutely fallen in love with
pen eyeliners this year this is the
Stila stay all day waterproof eyeliner
and this is just the sample size but if
this starts failing on me I will be
getting the full size of it i did buy it
for my sister-in-law who's one of my
closest friends for her birthday she
just said pick me out something amazing
and this is what I picked out for her
just makes a beautiful beautiful line
has this very fine point and again stays
on all day but is also easy to remove
which is something that you don't find
with all of these being easy to remove
and laughs all day just an amazing
product dries very easy to control I
like that you don't have to worry about
how much product is on there it doesn't
seep into my fine line so if you have
aging lids this is a good choice for you
this is just a fantastic product it is
everything I've ever wanted an eyeliner
right here by Selah thank you steal a
lot the last I product i have for you
before i move on to lips is the NYX
wonder pencil and I do have the Rimmel
scandaleyes version of this and I feel
like it looks cakey what you're supposed
to do with this is you put it on as an
eye brightener now I don't have any on
right now so i'll show you me zoom in so
i have to use the monitor so excuse me
so i don't have any on right now so what
we do is we put this one on kind of i
put it on the inner corner of my eye
it's kind of brighten i don't know if
you saw the difference there we put on
the other side so that I'm not not
balanced here so it just kind of
brightens your eyes also another thing
you can do is just kind of color in the
corner here I know that looks weird and
then just blend it in with your finger
like that hopefully I don't have any
swatches on my finger and it just kind
of brightens the inner corner here so
people in the comments of my video have
been kind enough my subscribers are
amazing they always are giving me tips
and tricks and different things they
said this works fantastic is a concealer
I have not used it for that because I'm
so addicted to the one that I have from
the bomb the staying power on this is
probably just a few hours so if you're
really concerned about you will have to
reapply but I've never found a product
that lasts all day this one is by four
are the best I brightening liner thingy
that I have found all right one more I
product I forgot is my mascara of the
year and that is by lancome and is the
Lancome Hypnose star now this one does
have wins and fails along with it but I
go with the fails in order to get the
winds and the winds for me for this or
it is is it is the first mascara I have
found that actually both volumizes and
lengthens my lashes without any effort I
can put one coat of this on my eyelashes
and I can be done it is the fastest
application i have ever used in a
mascara to get the look that I am
looking for I have very sparse short
lashes and I love love love this product
the trade off though is it does tend to
flake it does not smudge but it does
tend to flake so be aware of that if you
do purchase this that that is a problem
that I did have with it but I just love
this mascara let me show you the Wan the
wand is like Christmas tree looking
shaped appropriately for the season I
know it's past Christmas but amazing
amazing formula even though it flakes I
just let I let that go I just try to
check on it and make sure the flakes
aren't there because just it's so
magical in every other way okay finally
moving on to lip products I only have
two things to talk to you about for lip
products because these are the ones that
really stood out to me I did buy an
obnoxious amount of lip products this
year but these are the ones that I am
constantly reaching for all year long
the first one is the glossy form and the
glossy gloss that I'm loving is the NYX
butter glosses these are doe foot
applicator 'he's they have a semi
pigmented formula to them so i can carry
this in my pocket and apply this one is
there you go this one is in vanilla
cream pie I have more but I didn't want
to bore you with all of them this one is
in creme brulee where's that make sure
you can see that and then this one is in
this one's in cherry pie swatch those
baby for babies for you now what I love
about these is that they number one they
smell great but
and they don't have an obnoxious amount
of sent to them but if you don't like
centage you're not going to like them
but they have a very very nice smell
they are just very minimally sticky but
I feel like they kind of need that
stickiness in order to have some kind of
lasting power to them they have a really
nice lasting power they last me a few
hours and for lip gloss to me that's
pretty good so very very happy with this
formula and will continue to repurchase
these you guys made let ever gonna laugh
at this I have bought so many lipsticks
is ridiculous because before this year I
had very few lipsticks and my favorite
lipstick of the year is Airy fairy by
Rimmel I'm sorry it is I can't lie I
can't lie this is my favorite lipstick
and there's nothing I can do about it
it's not my matte lipsticks it's not my
Too Faced lipstick is on my Urban Decay
lipstick it's my airy-fairy my friend
moe sometimes it just happens that way
it is just an all-around fantastic
everyday lip color just I mean there's
there's nothing to me more fabulous than
a nudie pink it just it goes so nicely
with every outfit I ever wear if i'm not
sure what lipstick to wear i just
grabbed airy-fairy i'm done and that's
it i don't have to think and just it's
just amazing and i love it and yeah it's
got a little it's got a little bit of a
scent to it but again not obnoxious um
yeah that's my favorite i can't say i
don't know why i dunno why it's my
favorite but it is my favorite i know
that's kind of lame but it is so my
friends those are my favorite products
