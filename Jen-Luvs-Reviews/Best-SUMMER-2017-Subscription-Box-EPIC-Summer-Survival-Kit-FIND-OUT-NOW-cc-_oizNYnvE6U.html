get another fabfitfun box I have been
absolutely loving these boxes and I
cannot wait to show you and unbox
visually the suburb ox as you may know
fabfitfun is kind enough to send me
these boxes seasonally so I am excited
that they were nice enough to send me
this box for another sponsored video as
you know I am 100 percent honest in my
sponsored content I put a disclaimer in
every single video request when someone
wants to sponsor one of my videos that
it will be an honest and fair review so
this is no different it's not any
different than my cell of any of my
other videos if you want to let you know
that this is a seasonal subscription
it's $49.99 a season but it's over two
hundred dollars worth of products but
then the thing is is is this two hundred
dollars worth of stuff that you would
want that you would use the real
question when you get really down to it
is this $50 worth of stuff you will use
because just because something caught is
$200 worth of stuff doesn't mean that
it's worth it so that's what we're going
to find out right now they do give me a
ten percent off discount code for you I
do not make money off of that discount
code these sponsored video is just a
flat rate it doesn't matter how many
people sign up using my link it's just
you know it's done that parts done when
I make the video so if you sign up for
it it's mostly a tracking for my sales
to see whether it's worth it to continue
sending me these whether they're making
their money back on the box is what it
comes down to and you get 10% off so
that's how it benefits me I like to be
very very very transparent I'm sorry
it's not 10% off it's $10 off which is
even better than 10% off the tempers
that would only be five bucks where this
is $10 off your first box most of these
I like most of the fat that's on boxes
rare that I get when I don't like so we
will see so the first thing is the
magazine so it says hello summer and
then there's I'm not going to look at
this whole thing Jamaican get away
that's nice or giveaway oh that's very
nice and then this is what the box looks
like it is very full this says vital
proteins all I like viral proteins I've
met them
generation Beauty they're very nice pure
collagen protein and they gave a sample
of them are wringing the collagen I
don't know if the stuff does anything I
didn't use it for long enough to know
whether it does anything but I did enjoy
using it in that it doesn't add a lot of
flavor it's supposed to be to help for
your hair skin and nails joints and bone
you add it to your drinks and it's
supposed to be good for you so the first
thing I see is something that I'm
excited about this is the Juice Beauty
smoothing eye concentrate and I'm just
about to run out of my eye cream so I'm
excited for this some juice beauty
products I've really liked and some of
them I haven't let's smell it because
some people do not like cents on their
face and I want to be able to tell you
what it smells like vomit it up priming
it up priming it up there we go
okay a little tiny tiny bit of citrus
set I'll put some on we'll put over my
concealer feels a little bit oily just a
little bit what some may call hydrating
oh maybe not it felt initially a little
bit oily but now it feels just like a
lotion and just a very very very very
mild scent I don't smell it on my face
but I like my finger right up there I
could smell just a little bit so that's
very nice and then the next is the o'the
ml of Vianney ultra Lite hydrating
sunscreen lotion I can always use
another sunscreen so let's see how bad
this one smell is usually so this green
smell pretty bad oh my goodness doesn't
smell like anything oh yeah it does it's
got a very mild sunscreen scent but it's
not too bad it's not like gagging ly
sunscreen scent like some of the real
cheap sunscreens and I like a Vianney as
a brand so I think it's how you spell it
you pronounce it a V na is how you say
it if I'm wrong you can feel free to
correct me I don't have pride like that
so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong
so but broad-spectrum SPF 50 so that's
nice
nothing looks like making me go over oh
so good yes but those are nice this is a
water bottle this is cute I'm glad I got
a pink one say I love pink so this is B
kr the beauty essential that will change
the way you hydrate forever really in
the shade rosy why is this going to
change my life
weirdly magical what is this thing - why
is this magical you can spend a fortune
on your face and trust us we do but
makeup and skincare do their best work
on a skin that's hydrated and glowing
from within okay so it's a water bottle
but why is it magical why is it going to
change my life it's a glass bottle with
a protector around it and a little screw
on top all this just marketing or what
what's happening no I mean I'm looking
at this it's got this little breakdown
here in the magazine of the different
products and I'm looking try not to look
at everything else it says drink up this
gorgeous glass water bottle will change
the way you hydrate forever also a
convenient 500 milliliter size makes it
easy to take on the go but there's
nothing here that makes it look matte
it's a water bottle okay cool let's so
bone okay this is Himalayan pink salt
kit so it's got a grinder that's really
interesting and you can rind your own
pink salt okay let me tell you grinders
are not my friend right now I'm not
going to zoom in but I have a huge gash
taken out of my thumb because my idiot
self was watching a drama channel that I
never do and it was karma telling me to
stop and I was grating cheese and I
accidentally grated my thumb so grinders
and me don't get along it's definitely
very different though I'll give you that
so you get these two big rocks of salt
you get the tray here and there's a slit
in here so I guess that's to slide the
grater in yes so you slide the grater
into the slit so that it stays there
okay well we'll try it I just have to
make sure I'm not watching any drama
because that's what I do it so so far I
don't know about this box so far what is
this oh it looks like jewelry in a
little tube thing here okay oh how light
enhances intuition and promotes calmness
I don't know if you know this about me
but I love gemstones and the whole
properties of gemstones and what they're
supposed to do for you for you and I
love that stuff how light is not a very
expensive gemstone so it's not like
there's a lot of value to the how light
itself I don't know what this is made
out of whether it's real silver or not
but it's very cute it's very dainty
let's put it on to the consider links so
that's cute it's a good length for me I
like this length and if you have
a little bit larger of a neck it'll be
more of a choker and it'll of course
drop a little bit lower if you have a
thinner neck than me so that's a good
thing that it doesn't just it's not so
tight that it won't fit on everybody so
that's cool and I like the packaging the
packaging is cute the brand on this is
Chris nations Chris nations calm 16 to
18 inches oh it says adult adjustable
length so you must be able to clip at
different places so the next up we have
it'd be Michael stars this is a scarf or
a sarong I don't know what this word is
I'm not a big fashion person ruana I
don't know what that is either I'm gonna
have to look up and see the different
ways to wear this but I don't trust
scarves around my waist except for a
pond at the beach oh I see so you put it
on your shoulders like this and I'm not
a fashion person is this fashionable
because I don't know you off to you have
to educate me on whether this is
fashionable or not it's so it's very
long and it kind of drapes like that so
it's almost got like a cutout here for
your arms that's cute I don't know if
this is fashionable or not though am I
looking trendy and then it kind of goes
down to like a little bit past my butt
in the back so this is definitely not my
personal style but maybe it's your
personal cell but it's not my personal
style
maybe use this at the beach over my
bathing suit or something I don't know
but it's a pretty print it's just not
really my personal style okay two more
things in here this is the shoe than
cool peppermint and German chamomile
post trading massage oil very nice
that'll be good that'll be very nice for
my husband mostly but I mean I think
it's really nice to have massage oil for
anybody I'm excited about this I will
definitely be using this it looks like
it's apricot kernel oil based and then
almond oil and then hobo oil so it's got
some nice oils in it the brand is way of
will incorporated that's really cute let
me smell it I got to smell everything
ooh that smells really nice that's going
to be nice at the end of the day like
it's got a nice fresh clean you
definitely smell the peppermint and the
chamomile definitely soothe and cool
this is really nice that feels really
good
the thing I'm most excited about this
and the necklace I'm most excited about
ooh I love that that feels really good
that's going to be great I'm going to
make my husband give me back massages
now and then the last thing in here is a
makeup product this is a cargo picture
perfect highlight bronzer room they
usually send at least one makeup item I
like cargo blushes cargo makes great
blushes oh it's a highlighter very nice
let me see them but a switch okay this
would be very nice on a lot of different
skin tones
it's definitely shiny it's got that
poppity pop pop it's got a nice mirror
there for travel which is good and we've
got a nice shine there so I'm really
excited to try this super nice so now
it's evaluation time is this worth fifty
dollars to me one thing I want to
preface my final sauce with is that this
is my personal value your personal value
may be slightly higher slightly lower a
lot higher a lot lower we're all
different and that's what makes the
world go round
so just take this as my own personal
opinion I really don't like the necklace
a lot I would pay $10 for the necklace
max for the highlighter I pay another 10
for that so we're at 20 for the oil this
is a lot of oil I would say another 10
for that we'll say 30 for the water
bottle maybe 7 we're at 37 I have a
feeling this is worth a lot more than
that monetarily though the eye cream
this is probably worth we'll say I'm
sure it's worth more than this but we'll
say 15 comfortably so we're at 52 this I
probably wouldn't buy this even though
this is probably better than a lot of
sunscreens that I currently own I
probably wouldn't purchase this so I'm
not going to put a value on that
and then I know I wouldn't have
purchased this even though I will
definitely use it and then this year I
would not have purchased it's not my
personal style so we're going to leave
the value for me personally at 52
dollars so that is enough for me to say
that this box is worth it for me if I
saw this on a shelf for $50 I wouldn't
have been like yeah that's something I
need to have do I feel like I was ripped
off if I paid $50 for this no I
definitely feel like I got the $50 value
out of the box so this one's kind of
border
for me all subscription boxes have
they're really strong months and then
months there aren't as strong this one
isn't quite as strong for me but you
have to look at what comes in here and
decide for you whether it's worth it for
you the summer box is still available if
you do like this the boxes you get if
you order this there are two items that
have different variables the massage oil
and the sea salt I will put more
information in the description box about
what the other possibilities are for
those two items but those may or may not
be in your box everything else is the
same
any other information I find out between
this moment and when this video is live
I'll also put in description box and
make sure you check that before you
order what you think of a sapphic fun
summer box I'd love to know your
thoughts in the comment below
were there items that were really
exciting to you some that weren't do you
feel like this box is worth fifty
dollars for you if you do why if you
don't why I'd love to know thank you
