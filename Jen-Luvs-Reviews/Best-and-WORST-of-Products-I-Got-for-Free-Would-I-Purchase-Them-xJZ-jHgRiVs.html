to how fast this thing goes live oh my
gosh hopefully everything it's going
okay visually and auditorily I think I
might be a little blown out too bright
I'm gonna go ahead and turn the light
down a little bit because that's really
annoying and I'm not gonna get in
today's topic which I'm really excited
to talk to you guys about on a second
it's just too bright because you can't
test it ahead of time that's too dark
you see there we go
putting that down a little bit so you're
not like seeing this flash crazy-looking
brightness okay that is better that
looks so much better hi everybody
welcome to the led to the makeup
facebook chat not Facebook that's my
other until I got like four hours of
sleep last night
welcome to the woods up and make a
weekly chat on YouTube thank you so much
for being here I do a what to make up
weekly facebook chat over on our
Facebook which is called what's up and
make up so just on my words and all
twisted just had a really cruel hater
comment on one of my videos and it's
like oh my gosh how did you get like
this it's like but that's where I woke
up this morning it's crazy I woke up to
this leg I've no I should I should not
check my youtube comments right when I
wake up I should know better
but usually my YouTube comments are like
98% positive so usually I'm okay but man
my studies were just so uh yeah so
that's that's kind of I just read like
her response and I'm like what is wrong
but anyway I got the best advice from
Monica on my Twitter this week and I
have to share with you I know this is
off topic but I think this is important
at least it was really important for me
and it gets important just in general
dealing with negative people in your
life and I'm always confident trying to
understand negative people I'm always
trying to understand why would they do
that why would they say that what what
did I do to deserve this you know and
I'm always trying to understand
it was like you know I was giving myself
a little therapy on Twitter and mom was
like the reason why you won't I'm
paraphrasing understand why they're like
that is because you will never be like
that you will never be that kind of
person and that's why you don't
understand and that's like okay
I about love you right now Monica
because I thought that was a really good
point so I put that into my heart and I
just I hold on to that as I get more
comments like that on my channel you
know it seems like it increases every
month I get more and more of those so
you know but that's where my mind said
it is right now it's like thinking about
this because when you're a terrible
person you know it's I think it's a lot
I would imagine it's a lot easier to you
know let those things go but like I feel
like when you're a good person it's
really hard to like let those kinds of
things go but anyway Thank You Monica
wherever you are I don't know if she's
here I don't think that she comes to a
live chat but Monica if you watch us on
the replay I really appreciate you thank
you for that you made my whole week and
I'm putting that in my back pocket
so anyway we are currently three minutes
in and I hope you enjoyed you what
today's topic is even though I did put
it in the title so hopefully you know
we're gonna be talking about products
that I received mostly parts I've
received in PR which means up public
relations meaning that the company is
trying to send products out to people
like me to give the information about
them to give to you hopefully positive
information gives to means that you will
go out and purchase the products but as
you know when I get things it doesn't
matter to me whether I get them for free
or not I do have a video on Tuesday that
is going to it's gonna be interesting
I'd love to hear your reaction to that
but it's a along the same line of
conversation but my thoughts are
scattered today so anyway so you know I
don't it doesn't matter to me like
honestly like I can go out and I can buy
what I want to buy and I love my channel
the way that it is I love my channel
that I have my number one priority for
you so that is where I am getting my
motivation to continue creating videos
not the qaul
growing the channel and all of that it's
not about that it's about sharing
information with you so if I get
something for free then that's something
else I can share with you but if I don't
ever get anything free from that brand
ever again I don't care I honestly don't
care I mean it is nice to get things
early that's a great perk as far as the
channel growth goes and as far as giving
you information early goes but in the
end as long as I'm giving you good solid
information and I feel like my channel
is doing what it's supposed to do
so I've got some positive things here I
got them excuse me I've got some
negative things here but before I get
into his things I just want to very
quickly say hello to the people in the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
because they're also wanting to be
chiming in on these products and their
personal experiences so if they're you
know you're gonna be able to see their
comments over on the side of the screen
so if I say something's amazing and
they're know it sucks you're gonna be
able to see that you're totally gonna be
able to see that so you know they'll
call me out oh yeah they would call me
out but most of the time people we're
always rude usually all on the same page
on this stuff but anyway well not
everybody like you get one sec so let me
go ahead and just say hello really put
to the first people thank you so much
for being here
Agee is here good morning all from a
girl stuff you have teaching teen girls
advanced out to where and leadership
snow this weekend hashtag empowering the
future AJ I love you you are so amazing
amber is here in Lisa and cripple of RN
and Sarafina and Kelly and they's XO and
Jackie and Debbie and simply Bonnie and
Joanne and siggy love and Georgia and
Deanna and Lindsay and Jan and Valerie
in Nancy in the house Amanda Joe and
Sarah and Linda and Tanisha thank you so
much for being here and if I didn't say
hello to you they were probably about 50
of you that rushed in at the same time
so I apologize for not saying load
everybody but I think everybody else
would probably get bored so look so into
the first thing and this is something
I'm running out of and I thought about
doing an empties video but I honestly
like I don't like to keep my trash
around that's just a personal thing I
don't like to keep my stuff like empty
stuff I did for a while a couple of
years ago I was doing empties but I'd
rather to show you and then throw it
away this is something I am about to
throw away
I am definitely reaper tonight reaper
since I did get this for you from
Clinique and I've been definitely
purchasing this as soon as I run out of
my other cleansing balm they do have
some other cleansing balm for their
don't want to waste that I do want to
use up but this stuff is amazing this is
the Clinique take the day off cleansing
balm oh my gosh
this like this is amazing the only thing
I don't like about this is what was it
he the benefit the BADgal bang I was
like it came off easy for me no problem
and then in the comments people were
like I had a little bit of trouble take
from that mess there off and there were
quite a few people said they had trouble
taking it off and I realized I was
taking it off with this and maybe not
everybody has this so that's my only
complaint is it kind of for review
purposes it takes off makeup so well
that if I use it all the time for taking
like mascara off and then use that for
review that information is it
necessarily valid because this is just
so good at taking things off so yeah so
this is something I absolutely love all
right let me see what's happening with
people in the comment okay Missy loves
it Whitney loves it Euro turkey I'm
gonna say I can't ever do em teeth
either I'm having em to kiss me with
drive you crazy oh my gosh - Katie Marie
hello that clean thumb is great but I
hate the film at least over my eyes but
as I use it and afterwards just you know
I've heard that from many people and it
does not do that to me very often every
once in a while so what I usually do is
I put it maybe this is the trick maybe
this is what I'm doing that's good so I
don't put it on my eyes first I put it
on my face first so I grab a little
scoop I warm it in my hands I rub it on
my face and then I rub it on my eyes so
maybe having like a concentrated amount
of the product and putting on your eyes
first maybe they might be I might be
more getting in your eyes then when I do
it but I have had like the one from the
balm that when I do get that beard
cloudy
look over my eyes when I use it also the
hamish all clean balm the one that has
the donkey milk in it oh no money that
one can leave a little film over my eyes
sometimes this one doesn't do that from
you
why it's very here um let's see what
else Debbie likes it
Kelsey likes it Kelly I don't know
what's in it but it burns my face oh no
I can't say it's ever burn my face but
oh I'm so sorry to hear that if I had
the immediate list I could look at it
but well have you reading it less in
front of me amber says I bought that
cleansing balm haven't tried it yet let
me know how it goes come back to the
comments this video and let me know Pam
says love the clinic take the day off
blood times and curls I prefer the
pharmacy cleansing balm I've never tried
that one Ziggy says this Queenie creepy
eyes it doesn't hurt mine but I will
split legit open my eyes with it on my
eyes and I have no problems with it I
don't have sensitive skin look I'm not
one that typically has a reaction to
things so maybe that you can only I can
only speak to my own my own experiences
you know mama bear says that Hamish
stung my eyes
oh no that's a king bee brain in case
you did not know that one if it's not as
I think is out and lead to the New Deal
and I found out about that long they'll
get it the sub right the ancient Beauty
subreddit I think it's what's wrong one
that I am NOT as impressed with is heel
off seat on cleansing balm I realized
after I did the review of this that
ended up not it's not on my channel
anymore but we'll talk about that at
some point maybe Tuesday maybe possibly
this okay so it works but I don't think
it works as good as the clinic
I think the Clinique works better and
this is like a lot more at least ten
dollars more than this so and I think
you get a lot more product in the clinic
I mean if you look at the containers
next to each other and this one's all in
this one's fat so it's that whole la
object size thing that pre-k kids work
on let me see if it has the size it has
that besides on here must be by law okay
3.8 ounces in this one and then oh gosh
it's a tiny print Oh No
2.1 ounces in this one so yet Oh an
ounce and leaked over an ounce and a
half more in the Clinique I would
definitely recommend to clean over this
one even though this one has a nice
scent and it's
work this one I feel like works a lot
better okay let's see what else we got
we have so much to talk about so much to
talk about
Oh Tiffany dawn is here yeah the clinic
really is good it's very good but
definitely you know be careful with how
much you're getting in your eyes you
don't you don't even need a whole lot
like I've been used in this one I've
been using this one for something like
that I've been using it for a while you
really don't need a whole lot all right
let's go into foundations so these are
two foundations I wanted to talk to you
about this one I did not get in
technical PR I bought this with tipsy
points this is the Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation and this one it's a nice
more full coverage which I like but I do
get some kicking around my nose with
this one and on my chin just a little
bit of taking through the day and I
think the primer I use with this makes a
difference and I haven't pinpointed
which primer is best with it so if you
have suggestions on which climber is
best be the two things born this way I
would love to know those both in the
chat and or if you're watching on the
replay down in the comments below what
primer you find to work best with this
that doesn't on make it break up but
overall I do like this it's demin our
foundation that's my favorite because
it's just it's kind of intense it
definitely doesn't make your face look
like it's born this way like in my
opinion it definitely is leaning toward
a more cakey look like a more polished
look like like I like it for filming
because it gives me that like air were
not airbrushed but like that yeah let
alone an airbrush like that Mackie
looking like sullen face to kind of look
with this which it doesn't look very
natural in person so this is one I know
some use for filming but this one right
here this is more my taste actually let
me go down to the comments and see what
people are saying about that Sean says
it's cakey they say cakey exactly but
it's not natural looking you know if it
doesn't look like skin to me and the
fact that it's called born this way I
think is a little bit odd considering it
definitely it doesn't look like that was
born anyway it makes you look I just put
a bunch of makeup on
that's my opinion Stevie's is TVs girl
oh I still got your billing oh I had it
in my head and it just went out of my
head
hangover a primer works well it works
for me with Born This Way Foundation yes
I do like the peach primer with it I
feel like the hangover primer in the
peach primer are really good primers for
under a lot of foundations because
you're not silicone based so I feel like
silicone based sometimes foam you know
make the foundation break up you know it
feels good and can pull pores and things
sometimes it doesn't work well with some
foundations Janey I use our Genest
anti-aging primer nice polly pocket I am
NOT a fan of Born This Way it cakes up
and makes me look older I try it with a
lot of primers it's a no-go yeah and I
find that it sinks in my fine lines well
wrinkles let's be honest here look it
kind of seeps in a little bit Lucy Lou I
didn't like the hourglass vanish stick
and it wouldn't set maybe a different
time on
yeah I don't know maybe maybe I don't
think I didn't try the hourglass
interesting I think I did that's there
stick primer I wasn't a fan of that one
you do I don't like that one either
I like the way it's air on my face the
lady site miss one does that Born This
Way Foundation makes me super oily and
breaks up on me Felicia hey Felicia
Felicia is she's been around she's been
on my a lot of my periscope streams for
years I love Felicia I'm going to say
what's amazing on her
I trust her Oh Monica is here is this I
think you're Monica I think yeah you're
the same Monica check it on the replay
because I was breathing about you I'm
pretty sure by your picture it's the
same Monica so know what Monica looks
like for her pictures just so small on
their comments are going very fast I
have it paused
Tanisha also the to face foundations and
deeper shades have funky undertones do
they really
ooh good to know thank you so much oh
okay let's move on to this one this one
is one it does not have a good shade
range and I meant to not pick anything
without a good shade range why did I do
that okay I'll just mention it very very
briefly but
just tell you your lease you're watching
this from your picture shooting range of
Shaving just terrible you need to fix it
it's Nina why did I bring see I'm trying
not to do that but I'll just say it very
quickly fairly sneaky cream tinted moist
at least BB tinted moisturizer really
natural coverage I really like it but it
doesn't have a good shave range so we're
going to throw it over there from my
talk about her than you want until they
extend their shape JCT says hi Jan to
face makes me look like a carrot latina
it's here hello to you and Julio down by
the schoolyard good to see you Julie
says Born This Way makes me look old
which I am but I don't want to advertise
Oh Joely well the alternative to old is
not a good thing because that means you
don't get to be old and I'm trying to
find my hat in place the embracing that
I'm getting older and that you know that
just that's just what happens and you
know it's better than not having that
opportunity and there are a lot of
people on this planet don't get the
opportunity to get older and I'm
actually going to be 40 next month oh my
gosh a month from today's from now 40 so
I'm trying to embrace this but we live
in such a culture of not aging you know
there's in our culture it's it's almost
like we're seen as bad fur for naturally
aging there's some cultures where aging
is celebrated and I wish that we have
more of that time culture in the u.s.
you know I mean we've earned every
wrinkle we've earned this we have lived
we have learned I wish we could
celebrate that more you know there's
just so much like age shaming that
happens on especially on the internet
you know and people that you see you
know maybe in front of people that look
like they're getting older and so sad
it's really sad cuz we all get there if
we're lucky you know but anyway that's
off topic that's the way I feel well I
am a Gemini through and through
I know some people don't like Joe
I'm very proud of my Gemini miss my
husband is a Gemini to the birth Jeb -
he was born on June 19 all right let's
move on to Kadosh I've got some glaciers
to share with you guys oh my gosh
someone said before it it's kicked out
try living in Los Angeles I can't even
imagine can you imagine yeah rachel says
I'm 46 and a youtuber it's sad that
YouTube is a young girl's market and but
there's plenty of people out there that
are older it's all good it's all good
you know I mean you just thought it you
guys just got to be you and it's all
about providing something on you - I
people get so obsessed with this whole
birth thing like that comment earlier
about you know that my channel is that
one of the parts of the comment was that
non stuff this low number of subscribers
I don't care I don't care I'm not stuck
anywhere I love my channel I love my
content if you don't like it you go but
you know it it doesn't matter you know I
mean people get stuck in this whole
growth thing yeah it's nice that channel
that's bigger but it's like just I just
enjoy speaking to you and I enjoy having
you know people talk to you about makeup
and celebrating that that's what's
important people that stretch them
it's crazy focus on so many things like
good anyway I could go on
so anyway I got these two box blushes
these are from benefit so I got
dandelion and then I got gala for and I
have both of these and they're good
they're nice blushes I love you they're
buildable I like that they are very long
last thing I don't know if they're worth
the price I think the packaging is
adorable
I feel like these are kind of a splurge
item kind of thing at least from me and
I don't think I would purchase these if
they weren't sent to me but I am very
thankful to have them that's kind of a I
feel honor
oh I read mention as far as the Born
This Way I probably wouldn't purchase
this if I hadn't gotten this or with if
see points I probably get the perk aside
the Clinique is the only thing so far
that I would purchase and I wouldn't
purchase these even though I do like
them
I think they're good they're good washes
but I feel like you know blush is the
only thing I really want in a blush is I
want it to last on my cheeks for a long
period of time I do like building
blushes but I feel like you can get some
of those at drugstore prices but I
wouldn't let the makeup revolution
blushes those are really really nice
what else the essence blushes are really
good if you can find a shade that come
with essence what resist the shape and
is very small at least in the ones that
I've seen those are really nice blushes
now how many shades of pink do we really
need in life
oh but I mean I do really like these but
I definitely wouldn't purchase them if I
if I didn't get them that's the way I
feel about it let's see back here
recently got those new gold benefit
blush and it's so smelly really oh my
gosh Nicole Nicole from jail yeah Nicole
I Nicole she's one of my good friends
she says I love Milani blushes and you
know what I haven't I haven't bought
many Milani blush that you have tried
maybe one or two I think there would be
but my Milani blush collection but it's
one of this I took do I really need more
blushes and that's our reason why I
haven't bought any grethel says I like
mixing pink and orange blush as though
yeah there you go that's a good idea
Tanisha I love Judy's place and Becca
blushes yes they're both very good I
have the the genius placed blush power
they mean like that one a lot I need to
break that back out because I don't play
with that in the well it's very nice do
this place just so good
knowing I haven't like from Julia's
place was the eyeliners I did do a
review on them and I think I like them
at the time of the review but they try
out on me
like what they had went six months or
something they dried out on me and I was
very sad but I did really like them when
they were alive I got I just got some
duraline if I still had them I could mix
it in and fix them whistle says Jenny
helped me to not find makeup I love that
I love that I do Georgia says Tarte
mates with blushes you know there's a
huge cult following for Tarte blushes I
personally like I just think they're
just okay I like the better that one's
better
I know isn't that crazy looks like
sacrilege to just say that tart blushes
are not amazing but I just I don't think
that they're fantastic at least for me
maybe I'm trying the wrong shades and I
have not bought any tart lashes in a
really long time so maybe they change
the formula but I just haven't oh except
for no that was lorac thinking about the
Pirates make their game palette but that
was delayed on that wasn't sorry Steph
says pork pinion on Matauri yeah and
that's the problem that I've had with
them and also I had the common that has
the hard pan on tart blushes and I just
I know that there are a lot of people
that disagree on that but I can only
speak my own truth you know okay I can't
speak to other people's experiences
Katie says same thing questions just
okay me too Alicia I just got a mini set
from benefit and has four blushes in a
low light for 24 hours nice and that's
one thing that if it does really well if
like it's kind of excessive what they do
but it I mean it's a great way to try
those things are those kids that benefit
does their costly coming out with new
kits and things but it's a great where
you try these things one thing is
contracted with benefit with their
pilots their blush counts because the
formula in the pilots is different than
the rest formula it's not in the pouch
just so you know it is different I used
to buy those kits or they even have one
like this one right here that I
purchased and the formulas just aren't
the same a lot of times they'll go to
our de Lyon here let me show you the
color is the same
well test it so I haven't swatch these
next to each other in a while so we've
got dandelion here sometimes the shades
are a little bit different hopefully
we'll be able to stick his manual is one
of those later ones I got this one
because I didn't have Dallas and I
didn't have Rockets were I tried for at
least over they don't think I currently
own it you say they do look this saving
him Wow okay so the shades do look the
same in here for their but the formulas
a lot of times are different the
actually compound because the way that
needs to be pressed in the palette
sometimes it's different than the way it
needs to be fussed in the blush box
so the formulas can you difference
Annapolis from research that they did a
long time ago on not this one but hit
that was it was it was a year or two ago
it was a gentleman it wasn't this one so
that's good to know that at least with
this one they do looked at me the same
shape so that's good but I don't have
the other ones I pull away or they don't
I was taking a GPS place and I didn't
get me something I bought these but
they're gonna be okay that is so stinkin
pretty I think some people look at
Julius place especially people of my
skintone they go oh it's not made for me
because of the African things there
anybody can use this stuff it's I mean
you might have to use it a little
differently than someone with a deeper
skin tone but that goes with all makeup
and they're just Jimmy's clothes really
puts out some very high quality products
but don't you know with lighter skin
tone don't look at Julius place and just
dismiss it no all right let's see what
else is going on
mama bear Judy's place is beautiful and
all their pilots I own most of them I
don't know all of them and I don't think
I've gotten any of them okay they said
they were gonna send me some things for
PR when I saw my knife last year but
they didn't that's it
I still love them Michele city color
cosmetics have great blushes and they're
really inexpensive
Oh Michele oh my gosh Michele I have to
tell you Citicorp blushes for me they're
like instant clown face but I can't I
can't do it
they're so pigmented it's insane they're
ridiculously pigmented I can't do it I
can't I went out of focus for something
I can't do it with City color like if
you can rock a sodium City colored blush
go for it go for it I can't do it it's
there to infants have you know I've got
my hands up it is I focus due to a
sensory back negative but um yeah I hear
ya I hear ya
misty survived both those blush palettes
and all the pallets ever made by Gd is
nice Oh
I love my makeup revolution blushes that
very useful yes makeup revolution does
make really good blushes I really like
those there are why this pretty much is
the state color and that's why I like
them Julie I'm as pale as they come out
of almost everything in Jimmy's place
makes there you go so that's what I'm
talking about exactly
all right one more blush I want to take
out this is one that actually would
purchase because I'm a huge fan of the
balm blushes this right here this is
called the girls getaway trio and it has
bomb Springs Palm Beach and balm desert
my my big thing about this is that it's
all super light I wish they would make
one of these that I the bomb is not very
PFC friendly people call it friendly at
all but if this works for you then this
shade selection which for you I would
definitely recommend it and the bomb
only needs to work on there Thank You
Cindy but I do really like it okay I
want to talk about this right now oh oh
we brought me back with a boomerang hold
on a second I'm so sad that they don't
like it like they've got enough bristles
in them they just seem like they're not
not they don't do it for me
you know like this look hope with hope
this is not dense look it's this product
you know because they use it but it's
not dense at all so I've used this for
like packing on powder but normally I
would use it could be brush like this
for foundation and I can't use this for
foundation because it's too fluffy and
then we've got this brush and you'll
have to tell me I this is gonna mind how
to use that of the cake I'll have to
tell me what you didn't use this brush
for it's like a flat kabuki brush but
it's really small I mean I guess I could
use this maybe for packing powder on the
under eyes but what I prefer for
something like that something that's
more rounded so that it can get in these
corners very easily could the kind of
product that picks up on the very end so
I don't even know what to do with this
brush and I just don't like I'm so sad
this one's probably the best brush in
here because it's just so typical and
it's a blending brush that you should
really need to work on the density of
these brushes like a lot so this was a
know funny and I'm really sorry because
it's don't you
who knows what it is but brushes that I
do like actually let's look at comments
because I want to see what other people
and we all just tried to spectrum
brushes the mermaid set anybody else's
used it before CJ says anything uniform
I made I'm not into so over to Kitty
make up stuff and for a while I thought
it was really cute but I think they were
just not overplay like right now if you
noticed how many green and blue products
are coming out with eyeshadow products
like right now everybody rushed to be
green and blue stuff whitney says it
supposed to be for concealer but i
actually use that type of color pop
super shock shadows that might be
interesting it's so fluffy though um
Wiley's girl says I like BH Cosmetics
Elise hi Elise
I had the Mean Girls set and I love it
oh nice that's good much talking about
luck see ya and that was it's a nice
segue thanks Mike so brushes that I've
received in TR that I do really like are
the lucky brushes most of my lucky
brushes were either from Ipsy bags
because if she gives out a lot of Luxy
brushes or from Chiara from Moxie um
it's funny because the owner of luck see
every time I see him he tells me a new
secret and I'm so honored and he feels
comfortable talking to me about the
secrets for Luxy and it's just so sweet
like I just I just love that so but he
told me like about that the Jasmin brush
that I knew about that way before the
Wonder Woman brush that I knew about
that way before what they there before
they came out I knew about those and I
was so honored don't think that's so
nice of you but I do but on topic I do
really love Luxy brushes but I love
equally not there's some Luxy brushes I
like better than my motor brushes
because of the shape some of their eye
brushes the lucky I brush shapes are
really cool like really small blending
brushes that really get very nicely you
know into the crease the plan I really
like some of those but so Moxie is
amazing it is more expensive than motor
motive you can get a warmer love motor
brushes I feel like they are some of the
best inexpensive brushes then
I mean I've tried lots of inexpensive
brushes and I feel like motor just tops
them all
I mean the company we're a landline
Nicollet owns Mota they've been making
brushes for so many years the ridiculous
number of users so they just know what
they're doing and they were smart enough
to make a brush that was less expensive
and also high quality and I just I love
my motor brushes these are just
different lines one thing to know about
motor brushes is that it doesn't really
matter the handle the the the handles
the only thing they change in the
different sets so if you see a brush
like this that has this kind of handle
it's the same brush it's just what I
would handle you want whatever handle
you like better so don't feel like we
need to buy every collection from mota
because a lot of it's the same unless
you see a unless you sorry a comment
just popped up and I got distracted um
unless you see a shape that's moving you
that's you're attracted to don't feel
like you need to own them all but but
yeah they're super inexpensive and
they're really really good
I definitely what the menu is they're
wonderful and all my motor brushes I got
in Fiat so yeah Marie Jenn like you I
love motor brushes but I really want the
Smashbox brushes I just can't bring
myself to spend that kind of money yeah
I don't know any Smashbox brushes I
don't think except for ones that came in
pallets so I don't know anything about
those Emily says I hate motor brushes
are smaller they were full size I would
love them yeah they're full size were
you looking at the traveling sets
because they do have some travel stuff
that they're smaller but not all of them
are armed or small like these are motor
brushes this is their prismatic life and
I forget I lose track of all their lines
but legs see how this one's a little bit
smaller but some of them are bigger you
just have to find the right ones Jamie
says I just have to you from boxycharm
they're too expensive for me in general
oh okay gotcha I had to go back to that
comment look but bucks the eye brushes
Heather says let's the eye brushes that
want her to say Jen if see these nice
big down are great okay I saw it before
it weird skipped down
Nick says some pressures aren't too bad
I like their holiday sets I agree and I
did buy a tart brush set that I really
liked I do liked art brushes they do
more expensive TVs girl I want to try
the la belle brushes that came out this
past winter I haven't tried any la girl
brushes either Oh hmm Julie says I want
to get some Mota but I haven't got them
because they seem like their eye brushes
are big well you just have to look and
see the shape that you like they might
be I'm trying to find them in store it's
like let me hold this one up this one is
one I use a lot but you're right it is
kind of big like but I don't mind that
because of the shape of my personal eyes
Luxy brushes makes really good small eye
brushes though you might want to go bucs
and instead of Rhoda it's to be honest
with you there there are a little eye
brush sets Oh wonderful am I going to
have a table full of stuff and we've
only got 30 we've got thirty four
minutes in okay let's get over to our
shadow palettes okay perfusion has set
me so many palettes so many palettes so
many of these things they're gigantic
they're heavy like I'm thinking about
like kind of asking them to chill out on
the sending of the things because a lot
of them are very very similar they're
very mass-market marketed there are very
natural-looking they're very but they're
just okay as far as the pony I wish I
like the quality better I do I mean it
just like it breaks my heart that I
don't love them this will not even open
this one's not even open yet I have this
one because I pulled this one out of my
things to try to work but it's like
they're just they're sub they're heavy
and they're big and the quality is not
great
the it fades I mean it's like a typical
you know mediocre drugstore eyeshadow in
my opinion and that makes me sad I
thought their face products are a little
bit better but still I mean I really
feel like they need to bump it up
they're not bad you're just not great
and the price point is very inexpensive
like I think like something like this is
probably running about 15 bucks so I
think that they're super inexpensive
they sell these at a lot of the discount
stores like Marshalls and TJ Maxx and
stuff as well you can get a nice look
out of them
but if you're looking for something that
it's gonna do much yeah this so awesome
this is so fun
most of my most of stuff is not it's not
going to do a 40 and that that makes me
sad because I'm rooting for that because
they're they're so nice every PR package
these family sent everything
individually wrapped it's so beautiful
people over there are so nice and I hate
that I don't love it but I took of it
also along with that
I think that piece of PR I did a full
review on these actually let me talk
about those insipid any comments on them
the chats going so fast I'm like
basically like like skipping down and
pausing it nikki says Jenna if you try
try the Blue Marble setting spray I
don't even know what that is nobody
talks about it and it sets makeup like
nothing else I've tried it smells funny
but it's actually great to pretend scale
I even know I get to talk about blue
marble settings very much going on it
could be them I don't use settings
phrase blue marlin setting spray oh I
see it oh it's really inexpensive hammer
already cosmetics and it looks like it's
14 bucks why don't you set in space I
can't do it I can't do it it's like the
face touch the thing I can't do it I
wish I wish I liked settings race the
Chaya Monica semi secrets has a setting
spray and a hydrating mist I forget no I
haven't Korra for a DDF that's a
humorless setting spray isn't effects
makeup setting spray oh good to know
sounds like you know Rachel and Nicole I
got the Wayne Goss and every other brush
Wayne Goss brushes they are really nice
I have to say they're really nice I
believe it or not don't make fun of me
please don't make fun of me but I did my
friends daughters makeup for her junior
prom she wanted a very natural very
simpie book and it was very it's not
hard to do but I brought my Wayne Goss
brush that I have my I forget which one
it is but it's one of the fluffy
blending brushes
it blended like to join Iman her it
would seem it was amazing but anyway let
back off all right so let's talk about
these these are the carroty pilots I did
do a full review on these I have unicorn
dreams and I have just peachy
this one's unicorn dreams it looks
really nice and then this one is just
peachy
it looks like a tease and these are I
feel like a step up from the profusion
palettes they're really not great and
that makes me sad to you because again
the people over there are very nice they
did some nice new PR and indie brand
sending things in PR is a huge deal
because they don't have a lot of people
they can send key attitude because they
are a smaller company and I was really
sad I didn't like them I was able to get
some beautiful books out of these
pallets but they're not the ones that
stand out so you make me go WOW if you
know what I mean like attending like
it's just they're not we're good
but they're not at that great level so
that's just kind of the way I feel about
them but I mean the shade range is
beautiful as I love everything is mr.
Morley colors story when people talk
about the color story I think that it's
beautiful
I love the organization of it and I love
it it just kind of goes for me like to
use for many different skin tones the
inner corner even if you're not into the
unicorns and they're just it's just
beautiful and I wish they didn't include
so many in here because I feel like this
this could have been a little bit more
exciting in this row but I mean it's
just it's beautiful it's really
beautiful but they're just not the best
shadows ever they're good it's not that
along with that same kind of deal I
thought social sense is kind of in the
same range with carotene and they make
good shots but they're not the best
these also reset for me to me if you on
this one is the fairy fuchsia talent and
it looks like that and this one I felt
like for a fairy palette it was super
boring the house I mean for for fairies
but when I think of fairies I don't
think of this for some reason I mean it
matches the packaging so you can kind of
see where it is but I don't don't you
don't get fairies out of this I think I
think there is a bit of glitter and
let's shine and shimmer and this one
it's very it's a very monochromatic look
when you use this palette and it's just
okay it's just a thing and then this one
I loved a lot more this one has been
really fun this is the summer breeze
palette this one I really like I really
really like this one this is probably my
favorite out of these four that I'm
showing you this one's probably my
favorite this one has some really nice
picot to it I feel like the only thing
that I'm then I would be any kind of
critique is that I do have to reaching
the other palettes that kind of balance
out these shades because it's just so
much color so I feel I can even grab
some neutrals from somewhere else but I
mean it's like whatever but this one has
been really fun to play with I means
this needs four or five times and it got
pushed sit aside somehow but this one is
really beautiful and if you get some
gorgeous looks it is a little bit more
difficult for me to work with because
it's not intuitive the way that it's set
up trying to figure out what shades I'm
gonna put where it takes a little bit
more than artist eyes which I don't have
but I have creates and beautiful looks
with this it's very it's very pretty so
if I were gonna recommend any out of
those four it would be the summer breeze
this came out of the news last summer
really let's see anything else Tina
wants to know did anybody order a
novelist palette I didn't meet mother
says the fairy pot looks like lunatic
cosmetics lab contour palette a little
bit a little bit I can see that I do
like the lunatic labs cosmetics contour
palette but that I did not get in PR
which ones would I buy out of youth is
this great question having to tell you
that so I would not buy this I would not
buy these I would buy this this one I
would buy that's the only one out of
this okay should we go there I don't
know if we should go there do I want to
do I want to go there I brought it out
to go there but now I'm like what if I
want to go there the lawyerly Los
Angeles cat's pajamas palette people
like to pick on me whenever I mentioned
this stuff and it's like I don't have
the emotional energy today but I will
understand I'm just going to break it
down okay was the shakes
my favorite in here no I did do a full
review of this was 70 art shakes like
she was not my favorite but I really do
love the quality of these shadows this
palette is very fun
as far as is a very fun these formula is
very enjoyable to use if I had to edit
if I can edit this video that is what I
would say about this
it's very enjoyable for me to use it is
creamy it's blendable it's easy to use
so if you like these shades and you're
not they're super adept with eyeshadow
this is a realism palette to try but I
have purchased this like I said in the
video no I wouldn't have purchased it if
it wasn't sent PR but it's not because
of the quality of the shadows it's just
because of the shade selection I
probably wouldn't purchase it but the
quality is really really good I'm still
working on money the 2d full review I
will tell you that the mattes in there
are spot-on stinkin amazing I love the
mattes the shimmer in the biggest
complaint I have so far is I'm still
working with the fallout through the day
as I'm applying them I get a little bit
of fallout but through the day I'm still
getting a lot of fun well on my cheeks
homework my trying to figure all of that
out even the ones that aren't being
super like press glitter ones I'm still
getting a little bit of fall so I'm
still working on that but I would I did
actually purchase that palette it was
sent to me PR but I and I did purchase
it so that when I would even at this
point I would probably you know it would
be upset with my purchase on that one I
should say figure out those shimmer
shades because I'm all out and you
wonder why and it's like I mean I need
like more fallout that I'm you used to
during a day from any shadow age if they
just seem to be really up you know it's
sometimes when you put more pigment in
something it doesn't come together as
much you need to buy new ingredients to
hold the the shadows together in the pan
and also on the eyes so that it doesn't
fall out and there may not be enough
finding agent in the formula so we'll
see we'll see what happens
Lupe how you think she says I love the
packaging that job see why she actually
or not a huge fan of hers yeah I mean I
think that sometimes people are way too
overdramatic that's what it comes down
to you know I feel it I've said this
before I think I think that when you get
really into makeup it's almost like
getting really into the wine or coffee
or tea you know when you really get into
something you start tasting those notes
those notes that no one tastes unless
they they were overly into it you're not
saying like here drinkers you eat you
really get into something you can see
things that the typical consumer of that
thing doesn't see and I think that's
what's happening a lot with these
influencer creative products is that
they're being tested and tried and
criticized because people are seeing
things that a typical consumer might not
see is that a bad thing no but you know
we just have to respect that there's
different perspectives and different
levels of what people want as far as
performance and respecting that not
everybody needs certain aspects in an
eyeshadow palette like as far as like
the cotton you know some people will
really really care about packaging and
you design and overly bother them but to
some people that doesn't even matter cuz
all it matters is the quality of the
shadows you know what I'm saying like
I'm making sense why the way I'm trying
really hard to be quiet and my drinking
of my coffee but I think you know the
coffee must happen it must have been Mia
says these Jen answer questions once the
live is over yes come back and leave a
comment in the video description at
video scription in the comments for the
video once the video renders Monique
says I wanted my handsome makeup share a
color pop collaboration but it's out of
stock it's beautiful isn't it a her
design of that collection is just she
did a wonderful job like I looked at and
I went wow she did Brianna says are
there actual metallic shadows of Moore's
palette yes the to Ihram at this one
which one
and in cat's pajamas I would say this
one right well I would say my talent I
would say that there one other foiled
these guys right here scatter brain in
one here and redonkulous I would say
those are metallic and then really
patootie I think is over there at the
unsub I'll get me to you or your foot
hold on sir right and one of you need
the Tooting we've got these crazy guys
work here used to this j-bird and
unnatural which are those their leg
press Twitter's is what it comes down to
I would say as far as one metallic ones
we've got topless exposed and undercover
and say those are the more metallic ones
in your Owen buff those are the metallic
ones
it's not
when you get that shine on buff but own
natural and j-bert open mother in the
home were in a word they're like said
let me get these and it's so funny
because people on that video on my video
that I did my first impression well
likewise it will if you have two
different colors on your I this because
Jaipur to do different j-bert has it's
like a the copper and then it shifts the
gold I don't know if it's picking up on
camera but it's its own really in my
collection it's extremely I don't have
anything like that I mean I may be duped
somewhere on the planet but not in my
house
so I think we did is what something else
but yeah I mean I mean that like I said
a matter
the standout product that they've been
here that's or what that I'm using but
even the like these guys are giving me
fall out there today which is there so
I'll be fun with them and I'll let you
know go ahead and skip down lady says
the only press letters I've tried all
the lines of my lips came out and made
me look at them 500 years old this I
don't feel like does that I don't feel
like it does that um but I haven't had
that problem I have to say Jen says pop
lips did a good video and where these
palate just don't wash around your kids
you can't watch pop bucks for on kids
you can't watch maybe to run kids he's
amazing though I love maybe oh my gosh
he's like my current accession I go
through phases
maybe he's my friend obsession from
potlucks I love his videos but
definitely he cannot watch them he's
he's crude man some stuff it's no he did
the the review of the seashell Beauty
Blender thing and he said it looked like
something that I'm not going to speak
about on my channel but something
masculine that is very natural but
something that I like to keep my channel
a place that you can watch it funny to
get excited and say but but he's very
very funny very funny okay so let's move
on a little bit to be only got ten
minutes left I'm taking my daughter to a
very festival today so I've got to you
know get my energy and get going to that
after
they're all right so this is this was
not sent to me that long ago from the
rock this is their contour palette this
is so good
this is definitely something that I
would purchase so this is something I
have my eye on for a really long time
and I kept looking at the price point
okay we need another contour palette
melding and I didn't want and I wouldn't
purchase it but then my last something
now I'm like why didn't I have this in
my life earlier it is similar to me to
be honest I z1 which I also own so did I
need it though but it could easily have
replaced some other consulates in my
collection the last thing how really
good the blend ability is really good
I do wish the shades for me personally
were a little bit blue bird that's
really my only thing I used this on on
Jade who was the girl that I did the
prom makeup on I use this on her it's
gorgeous on her this very natural use
this shade the deep contour isn't super
deep so I guess it would just depend on
on on the on your skin tone whether you
use this or not but I thought this would
work for a lot of people even if it
wouldn't work for everybody it would
work for a lot of people I don't really
use the Bella pilot much just because
they don't feel like I'm you yellow
highlight for you no cuddling for
Discipline rich and things like that but
I do use the beige highlight what I've
been doing ever since I Lindsay
Schoolcraft in Phillipston she came over
and did my makeup that one day I have a
video it's so good if you did not see
the video with anything to school that
it is such a good video and I feel like
people didn't necessarily know how good
that was gonna be that videos gonna be
it's what they clicked on it no ago
those could be was so good she's just so
charismatic and so she has such good
information about do we make up on the
road and what it's like to be on the
international tour and even makeup
artist for the band and you know she's
in this crazy black metal band she's
almost done a good tour she's almost
official on her way to Australia
smell it two weeks left but anyway back
on topic what she taught me which I
think I had seen in videos before but
hadn't ever adopted it myself
was to do the contour where you do the
contour and then
this matte highlight shade here and here
so just blend it out and it's absolutely
beautiful
it's it just blends it's so nicely it
makes it look so much more natural than
what I have been doing before which is
just applying the contour blush and
highlight and being down like that I
really like doing that you know just
blending the contouring so I mean I'm
very thankful that she taught me that
and what should really really well this
particular palette
Lupe says I want to support you and
ended up loving it it was so good wasn't
it it was so good ivory says I'm not
pretty like though it's not my favorite
salad music I even told Lindsay that's
my favorite salad music but but I really
like her
I'm feeling like her Jen says can use
the matte highlight to set on your eyes
I music even became the Kanto puffs that
yes you can absolutely and Katy contour
palette is very similar in that too like
the Anasazi to Kathmandu the lorac
they're all amazing I mean they're all
fantastic Oh Nicole hit panel know about
contouring pouching is to get a new one
soon nice but yeah this one's really
good this one's really good but it's
interchangeable from uni quality-wise
with the Anastacio and a cap on to eat
just whatever shades quality to move I
would say any one of those three but
this one's really good seeing that was
the one essential are the other two
we're not setting up alright let's talk
about highlighters real quick because
we've got five minutes left
oh well very quickly let's very quickly
touch on lip products and then we'll go
to highlighters
so these are ones that stood out to me
as ones that were sent in QRA that I
really like this one is from Milani
cosmetics and I think I've talked about
this I don't know but at least five
times on the channel my friend Shani who
also has a YouTube channel I haven't
talked to her in really long time but we
were talking a lot when
around the knees launched and I still
really like these they have a little bit
of sparkle in the basin under hold
sparked dazzling lipsticks and they're
really really pretty nice if I can get
up see if you can see you see a little
purple shift in there this one is called
laksa this means my favorite they like
this one I've been enjoying this one a
while I like a lot of them that this one
has been the one I've been reaching for
it the most and then this one here is
the liquid lipstick is called chai the
names go together I don't like the
liquid lipstick why
much but I do like it and this one is
interesting because if you won't see the
shift until like in a swatch you don't
really see this shift but that adds it
drives down see it wow it's know it's
coming it's there now like you can see
at least I can see it just a little bit
you see the purple if you shift in the
liquid lipstick and they're very
confident very nice and I don't believe
a sparkle on your lips after the color
has one gone just never like and they
also smell really good if you like
scented with onyx but this if this one
smells exactly like chai tea exactly
like it's you nailed the scent if you've
never smelled chai tea
imagine a like a cinnamon gingerbread
kind of scent with a little bit of milk
enos groaning that's the way that I
would describe it or the Christmas
cookie cinnamony kind of scent but with
like a milky also in them the other one
that I really like are the collab
lipsticks I did purchase some of these
and then collab did send me a few more
which I thought was very nice again
these are very intensive you can get
them at Sally Beauty and they are some
of the creamiest like there's so much
it's one of my favorite lipstick
formulas and they're very inexpensive
they're really really nice so that's
another thing and then taking the pull
out I do want to mention best because
both of these I did not pay for either
of these so I would buy both of those
these I would buy the grab one I would
not buy the back of one I think I got
the bad guy in a foxy Tron which I don't
pay for and the back of one's good it's
nice but I think the cloud one is just
as good and it's a fraction of the price
this one isn't velocity this one here
and then this is in Prosecco pop yes I'm
pretty sure I got done coxeter so
they're different shades within a month
they're not the same shape and you know
just trying to try to show you the
formulas next to each other because I
don't see any point in buying something
that it is more expensive if you can get
the same thing or less expensive price I
can think that's headed unless you're
buying it for packaging like
specifically I do feel like now that i'm
swatching these next to each other the
the cloud one is a little bit creamier
almost a little bit more like
moisturizing looking so this is the
Becca and
this is the collab so I can get to shine
for yet to not see the shine on him
that beautiful and I do think the collab
one melts into the skin just a little
bit better but that might be a shame too
because exposed to my natural singing
but yeah I really like the cloud line
overall their eyeshadows are good
they're not like oh my gosh
loading array amazing but they're really
good especially the drugstore price one
to tell a lot of trouble finding
eyeshadows I do like they drug her price
point and the cloud shadows are very
good I would compare them to let's say I
would say they're about the same is like
the SEPA better Coastal Scents summer
breeze as far as my enjoyed how much I
enjoyed using them I do them at two tuna
palettes and enjoy using both of them
I would definitely purchase both of them
I did purchase one maybe the one you
said I wish I could tell you the shape I
did want to mention the highlighters
these over highlighters definitely well
no this is this website over
highlighters vote for highlighters are
some of my absolute favorite
highlighters of all time they're amazing
the price points insane the price points
insane I don't think any purposes I have
to say it I don't be able to purchase
them and that's because I don't think I
would ever spend out much on a
highlighter I think there are def ice
points crazy like my match on a
highlighter is probably around the
twenty dollar mark where I'm offered
once it gets past the twenty dollar mark
I'm kind of like like it better you
change in my life for one color product
you know I mean that's what it comes
down to it's one color so I mean if it's
a palette at least I'm getting a bunch
of different colors to play with but if
it's just once a word I just think
they're insanely overpriced and you can
find discount codes 30% discount codes
for overall all the time 20% discount
codes all the time that would be the
only way I would purchase these but
they're really good they're beautiful
beautiful highlighters they remind me a
lot of the back ones but I honestly like
the other ones just a little bit better
than the back ones well because they're
about the same they're both amazing the
price wants insane for both of them
well I mean like Becca hi layers I do
own a couple that I purchased but I
don't know I don't know like mixing
current it's too much it's too much it's
crazy
and that's just me personally
everybody's got their own everybody's
got their own 20 lookups I don't want
miss Bullock coming to these things boss
but I want to say they're like $28 or
something I'm getting highlighter on
might consider yeah I later refill Oh
need some refills now that's cool so
okay here we go so they have the refills
for $18 which oh no those are the minis
the minis are $18 $35 this is $35 no ah
no no no no never would I ever know and
Beverly Hills which I actually love is
$40 I mean it does have five shades in
it but $40 for one damn I guess people
are buying it I just can't I can't even
I can't this is the one that
nikkietutorials I came out with this in
Sunday's donut it's beautiful
price plus outrageous oh that would be
enough even though I do love them I
think eventually maybe I might scurvy
that one but
no no no no no no Steph says glazed
doughnut but they they stir leavening
rose gold highlighter is a drugstore
pricing for me that's good to know
I don't know that one Naomi says I love
my mini refill plans I just can't pop I
can just pop in my magnet palette so
that's a smart thing to do it's very
smart it's just it's crazy I think
Monica said do that go up I think it
might have Jen says I like dr. Chopra
nurse part of twenty dollars a month
yeah that's why I kind of feel that box
run to where I think it must run forever
you see my doctor trauma box since I've
been beginning and forever but I think
and I think do you think that boxycharm
overall if I wasn't getting it for free
I would continue to I would buy box a
truck for the $21 month I would you
probably did like your subscription a
boxer John if I didn't get it quickly
are
ultimately am I'm happy become every
month now just like March March I was
not happy with my mom at all but I feel
like it's worth the rest because for me
I had that $21 that I can I was found
something that comments and he was
saying about God to Johnson's in this is
kind of on topic oh it's one it's one
hour and okay let me just wander back to
some and I'll shut up okay so someone
asks that comment there was I'm trying
to set it about determined on this is
the way I feel about it I feel like with
any beauty subscription it's like
playing the lottery it's like on the
slot machine I mean you never know what
you're going to get you don't know if
they're completely throwing your money
into the trash you may get a box that is
full of things that you will never use
and you're completely wasted your money
you have to be prepared for completely
wasting your money if you are not
prepared for completely wasting your
money I don't think we should ever do a
subscription box but if you have that
money to gamble with if you don't feel
bad if you lost that $21 and you'd be
okay with getting a bunch of stuff good
news then I think the box of trauma is
probably the best one that I personally
tried I've heard some really good things
about what the world UT box except for
that story in the news today and if you
think about oh no I'm not gonna go into
it now you can watch in the news but
there was your things happening I think
it's a myth it's in the late breaks
about like a a scrap of of a makeup
eraser came no-load beauty box located
with an unfinished scrap I don't know
he's really here you can see in the
lyrics of today's new show but I've
heard good things about that one support
play I had first short period of time
and my subscription something back with
the peanut and I'm just ditched it and
just let it go if see I do cuz they need
to pay for but if I didn't make videos
about if see if I didn't do actions like
except probably cancel that one matcha
turn is one of the OTP okay yeah that's
kind of how it got subscription boxes in
general and I do I do you really like
vodka Charminar look what to say so but
anyway I should probably pop off here so
we can get ready to go to the very best
of all I'm gonna try to have a positive
outlook on there so don't feel like
driving there and don't be morning going
my daughter wants to go so someone who's
taker
