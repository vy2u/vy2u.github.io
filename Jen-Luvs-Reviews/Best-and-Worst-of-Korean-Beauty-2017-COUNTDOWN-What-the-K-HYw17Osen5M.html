the K when we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money anything I was ever
gonna say that again did you if you're
new to my channel in the past couple
months you've never seen know what the
case so welcome to what the K I did the
series from February to October I didn't
get a lot of views but people I've had
so many people asked me to bring back
what the K and I may one day bring back
some episodes if there's something that
I really really want to try but one
thing I did want to do before I let this
go as kind of the season finale is to go
through the worst products I tried them
what the K all the way up to the best
products I tried I did do 27 videos for
what the K and so I chose 10 of them to
talk to you about today I did want to
focus on products that I tried past the
video ones that really made a huge
impression on me things like that so
that I could even give you more
additional information on these products
so if you are interested in K beauty
you're really gonna like this countdown
let's go ahead and start with the worst
Korean beauty product I tried this year
at number 10 so this one is one that I
don't have anymore I'm gonna put a
picture of it right here this is the
Chango 22 dong hongmen jell-o color
eyeshadow palette I did return this to
the store and actually it's funny
because I brought it to the fore and
they were like we don't sell this and
I'm like yes you do it's on your website
and there's a reason why you've never
seen it before because it's not good so
when I use this basically it's like a
shiny gloss for your lids there's it's
got a really cool squishy kind of
pudding kind of texture when you touch
it almost like a color pop shadow but a
little bit more smooth and you you can't
put your finger in it as easily it's a
little more solid very much kind of like
jello it was a very interesting texture
but the color payoff was terrible and
what was worse was that it creased
really bad now I got a lot of flack for
that video in that you know I understand
Korean beauty is very different than
American Beauty American Beauty we want
looks like like eyeshadow where I'm like
I am like this I get it like I totally
get that
but I want to be able to tell the
difference between the colors on my eyes
at least and I don't want
creasing on me that was my biggest
complaint it's not you know I get it
about the pigmentation but it's more
than the pigmentation it was the fact
that it didn't have color payoff at all
to the point where I could barely even
see the colors it was it was bad so
that's why that was the worst product is
because it just completely let me down
number nine is a product that I actually
passed along to my friend yay or nay
Nicole her daughter wanted to try this
this is the Eliza Beckham milky piggy
carbonated bubble clay mask the reason
why this is number nine is a personal
choice and it's because I hated the way
it felt I've realized that bubble
bubbles breaking on my face like little
poppy like it almost feels like pop
rocks all over your face these little
teeny tiny like itchy pin pricks all
over my face as the bubbles pop it was
so uncomfortable it was I was very
miserable that's I wore this no bad
effects or anything nothing bad happened
to me except for my face felt kind of
dry when I used it I only used it the
one time it was so uncomfortable I
passed it Nicole I didn't even ask her
whether her daughter liked it or not but
I'll have to ask her whether she liked
it but I did not like it it was very
uncomfortable for me because it was just
oh it she it was like little ants
crawling all over my face blue Oh No
number eight is actually not a terrible
product I was just mad at for false
advertising this is the skin-food
honeypot lip balm and it's it's very
adorable the packaging is so incredibly
cute it is a mineral oil based product
and it says that on the website it talks
about you know how honey is good for
your skin blah blah blah blah blah but
then there's no honey in the product
like at all like don't eat skin feed
don't do that you don't you don't
advertise how beneficial honey is and
then you put a product up that has
absolutely no honey and then I actually
contacted skins when they got back to me
and they confirmed there's no honey in
this product so why are they saying you
know the benefits of honey along with
the product I find that to be very
misleading and it made me very mad so
that's why this one is so lowdown it's
not the worst because it actually feels
kind of nice it's not a bad lip balm
it's just the marketing of it I thought
was extremely deceptive and I'm
surprised they could even get away with
something like that number 7 is another
product that I gave away this is the
Eliza becca milky piggy Kenzie packed 24
karat gold masks this tried out my skin
something bad it does
alcohol as one of the higher up
ingredients I also felt like when I
looked at the ingredient list there
really weren't any good solid
ingredients in it that I felt like would
be great for the skin that were higher
up any good ingredients were very very
low down on the ingredient list I feel
like with the whole 24 karat gold every
bit of research I've done on 24 karat
gold in skincare it's basically like
nope this is does absolutely nothing
just because something is valuable in
one way it doesn't mean it's gonna be
vital in another way you know what I
mean like I love money but you won't see
me rubbing it all over my face from what
I've read there's absolutely no skincare
benefit to gold in skincare but I was
hoping there would be something else in
there that would be beneficial to the
skin not really it just dried out in my
face
now we're getting into things that were
just kind of okay for me this is the
Holika Holika aqua petit jelly BB cream
yeah BB cream this was fine it does have
a jelly texture it's very weird it's got
the spatula in here which is very odd
and then it's got this weird like jelly
consistency to it I don't know it's just
it's jiggles inside the two in the thing
here I don't know if you can see that
but it's jiggly in there and it's just
very odd it feels fine to go on like
once you've got it on it feels fine my
big issue with this as I it doesn't have
good lasting power I've used it with a
bunch of different primers I've used it
with a lot of different face powder
setting powders I don't use setting
spray so maybe setting spray would work
for this
but the lasting power on this was
terrible even after you know four or
five hours I felt like it was
significantly faded and that's not cool
for me so this one's a no for me it
wasn't bad it just wasn't good number
five is a really fun one I actually
really enjoyed using this product and it
still sits in my bathroom because I hope
to use it again one day but this is the
j1 Hana cream it's the dramatic anti
wrinkle effect intense capsule cream so
it's these little teeny tiny balls and
what you do is you pick them out with a
little teeny tiny spoon because you
can't really reach in there and get one
because you'll actually I think I just
got one did I get one they're very
difficult to get out look see I've got
one it's like a little lollipop on the
stick but once you get it out you're
supposed to use a little spoon you
squeeze it like this which is extremely
is fine and then you rub it in your
hands it feels a little jelly like at
first but it very quickly turns into a
cream and you put it all over your face
and it feels really good it feels very
hydrating I'm just going to rub it into
my hands because we need to anti-aging
on our hands - it feels very hydrating
and I love the hydrating effect of it
use it for a while though like
religiously every day and I didn't see
any skincare benefit to it at all I
didn't see any results I forget how long
I tried it for off to go back and watch
the video I just didn't see any results
like I did with some other skin care
that I tried this year so this one is
gonna be a no just because it is a
little bit expensive and I didn't see
any dramatic anti-wrinkle effect
happening but it is a good moisturizer
so that's why it's so high up next up is
a product I had a lot of fun with this
is the nuni marshmallow whip maker and I
did get the nuni snowflake whipping
cleanser this is made if you remember
Meeny box back in the day Mimi box is
still around it's not mean box its mini
box they're still around and they
actually produce products that you can
find on Ulta these used to be available
also I think they might still be but I
will put a link down below because I
don't think if you search for it you can
find this but I will put a link down
below so that you can't find it because
I could find it before I started filming
this video so what you do is you put a
little drip of cleanser in there and
then you put a little bit of warm water
and you go like this and it turns into
whipped cream and I will insert a little
clip from my video there so you can see
what it looks like but this is so so fun
now the the little whipper thing I feel
like is the one I want to talk you about
right now as far as the cleanser I don't
feel like you really need the cleanser
I've used this with multiple cleansers
and it still works it still turns into
fun whipped awesomeness and it just it's
just a gimmick but it's fun and I enjoy
it it makes getting character and of
interesting and different I do want to
mention though is that you can get
things like this for much cheaper than
this particular brand I did find one
from a brand called graceful Vera for
three dollars and 38 cents on Amazon I
think there's even places we can might
even be able to get them even cheaper
than that so kind of look around if
you're interested in this you don't need
to get the nuni one it's just basically
you know if the little it's got these
holes in here and it's a little
I mean it's it's not gonna complicated
of a thing it shouldn't have to cost you
an arm and a leg for it but it is on
sale right now for four dollars and 80
cents on the Ulta website I'm assuming
they're gonna stop carrying it soon so
if you're interested you can buy it on
the olds website for a little under five
bucks and it's just really fun it's
really fun and it does show you the
little water line right here on the
bottom where to fill up with water I
mean only the tiniest little bit of
water and it's I enjoyed it it was fun
but you don't need this this this is
just a cleanser it's there was nothing
magical about this it was fine but this
is a fun part right here for number
three this is a product that has kind of
grown on me this is the Hamish all clean
bomb and what I was kind of expecting
this to do which I think was unrealistic
is to remove my makeup and clean my skin
in one step that's not really what I
find this to do it does remove my makeup
but I do feel like I need an additional
cleanser on top of that too like a
foaming cleanser like something like
this along with this to make sure that
my face is actually clean which is what
this thing is advertised to do I do
really like this now now that I've been
using it my only complaints about it is
I feel like even though it is advertised
to be able to be put on your eyes it
does kind of cloud my vision a little
bit when I use it which I don't like it
really creeps me out and the other thing
is is that this may be different than
what you can buy now because this was
the one that had the donkey milk in it I
do believe they've changed the formula
to be vegan now so I don't know what the
new formula is like but I am enjoying
this one and if you can still find this
one I can vouch for it but I've heard
that that even the new one is good on
the asian beauty reddit they've said
that the new one is good too so yeah
definitely recommend on this one now
that I've tried it more moving on to my
favorite things I tried this here is the
cynic
honey all-in-one ampoule oh my gosh this
stuff is amazing I love it it smells
like legit honey it smells good I don't
like the packaging I don't like that I
have to keep dippin this little spoon in
here to get it out I did mention in the
video that you can buy pumps for this
but I wish that they would just put it
in something with the pump initially it
was very inexpensive for how much you
get I mean this is a huge container of
it it's gigantic and it was relatively
I think was maybe 20 bucks for this
giant container of it the ingredients in
here are spot-on on point I will link
all of these videos down below so you
can check out the full ingredient
breakdown but there's so much good
research on honey in skincare and I
absolutely fell in love with this and I
love the way it makes my skin feel I
love the way it makes my skin look I
mean I see immediate like skin
brightening and makes my skin look just
like plump and youthful and oh my gosh
like within like a day or two of using
this in a row like it's like it's still
there one of the big ingredients in this
is a very high concentration of
niacinamide in here not high
constriction it's 90% honey but there's
a lot of nice cinnamon in here it's a
skin even err like it evens out your
skin tone and also is an anti-aging
ingredient and that happens to be very
high up on the ingredient list that
makes me super super happy I mean it
just oh my gosh it's an amazing product
and I really really enjoy this I do have
a friend that tried this and she did she
does have more sensitive skin and she
said that this irritated her skin a bit
so if you do have sensitive skin this
may not be the product for you I don't
have sensitive skin and I absolutely
love it and I like that there's lots of
really good skin benefits in here too so
this one's a good one I'm the number one
product if you've been watching any of
my live streams getting ready with me
for what's it been makeup or I've talked
about this so many times like of course
this had to be number one this is the
Holika Holika sweet cotton for cover BB
cream and soft beige I'm like how if
this is like half gone I have trouble
not reaching for this because it is so
stinking good oh my gosh it's amazing it
is kind of a medium coverage and it just
gives this beautiful satin look to the
skin and I enjoy this so much if you're
interested in this they only have a
couple of different shades there aren't
many but remember you can always use
those color-changing drops they make
them a couple of different brands I will
put some down in the description down
below of some options for different
brands for the color changing drops you
can always buy one of these shades and
then put either make it lighter or
darker depending on what you need and
still be able to use this it does have a
very light cotton candy kind of scent to
it but it's very light it's not super
strong it just feels it feels good it's
a nice thick
formula to go on and it just goes on so
smooth and gives my face such a nice
satiny texture to it it just looks
beautiful on the skin lasting power is
fantastic and this is one of my favorite
products I tried all year I am like
super game-changer for me I really have
been enjoying this so this is definitely
well deserving of the number one spot
for my wet decay countdown so that is it
