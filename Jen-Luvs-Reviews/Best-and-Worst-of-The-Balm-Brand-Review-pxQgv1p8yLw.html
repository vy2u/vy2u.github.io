video forever and actually I did make
this video about a week and a half ago
and there was a file error so I have to
reshoot it but I really really really
want to get this video to you and it is
my collection of products from the balm
if you've never heard of the balm it's
not sold in Sephora or Ulta so I'm not
surprised if you've never heard of it
but it is quite popular on YouTube where
most of the people on YouTube and people
watch youtube videos buy products from
the balm is on a website called
HauteLook which is a flash sale website
oh look a Kaz the bomb's products about
every three months is kind of where I've
tracked it I keep my eye out for it as
soon as the sale goes live I try to jump
on it do sell out very very quickly
usually within the first half an hour to
an hour
the newer products or the products of
the most popular typically sell out so
when they are on HauteLook they're
usually half off which is amazing if you
are not willing to wait for what look or
don't want to deal with that you can go
to the balm calm to find these products
and it's ba LM not be OMB I do have
quite a collection of products I want to
start off with my least favorite
products and then move up to my favorite
products so I'll start off with my very
least favorite product which is the
stain II act this is a lip and cheek
stain it just says a hint of tint for
cheeks and lips this stuff the reason
why I do not like it is because it
doesn't work when it comes down to it
doesn't work I'm going to go ahead and
swatch that for you on my hand you can
see that it is very sheer either way I'm
going to kind of blend it out so you can
see what it ends up being and you can
see it immediately stained in my hand
for a lip color if you're not really
looking for a lot of pigmentation and
you just want a little bit of a tint
then this will be fine but the smell of
it is the only not a cough syrup it's
more like a very bad mixed drink and it
just doesn't I don't know I just don't
like it it doesn't work the way that I
would like for it to and I just don't
enjoy it so that's number one the rest
of them I actually that's the only one I
don't like the next couple or ones that
I like I just don't think they're
phenomenal and the first one that I want
to talk about on that category is the
time bomb face primer
this is a silicone consistency and I
will squirt that for you so you can see
and it does go on very very smoothly it
goes on very very nicely I love the way
it feels on my skin it does not really
have a pore minimizing effect for me it
doesn't really make my makeup stay on
longer it just kind of feels nice it's
got it's a nice base for my makeup to go
over top of but it doesn't do anything
bad
it does mattify just a tiny bit but it's
it's definitely not anything I feel like
you should go out of your way to get
even though it's not a bad product it's
not a great product the next one is a
bomb shelter and this is the tinted
moisturizer it is an SPF 18 what I do
use this for I actually got this in a
shade darker than my skin tone because
you don't want to go out and buy all-new
foundations and BB creams and things
just for the summer so what I do is I
squirt a little bit of this into my
current foundation or BB cream and it
darkens it up just a little bit for
summertime and that's what I have used
this for and it works beautifully for
that as a tinted moisturizer it does
everything you expect the tinted
moisturizers to do it lightly
moisturizes the skin a very very light
coverage just the way you would expect
it to to moisturizer to be again nothing
spectacular nothing to run off and get
but it does work really nice for that
purpose of darkening whatever product I
have or if you need something to lighten
a product for the winter months this is
a good option I really enjoy it for that
purpose now moving into a palette that I
like the least and that is the nude 2
palette and it's funny because when I
first got this it was all the rage on
YouTube everybody's talking with this I
remember Emily Noel 83 did a fantastic
tutorial on this and she did a review on
this and everyone just went nuts over it
so I got it and now lately I've been
seeing a lot of people saying that they
don't reach for it and I have to agree I
don't reach for either you can see that
it is quite messy because my black is
shattered these two shades stubborn and
standoffish are very good what am i
doing they're very very very similar I
don't know if you can see that my swatch
them on my hand for you I mean just very
very similar shade just nudey pink
shimmery Pink's they could have what I
would have appreciated here instead of
one of these would have been more of a
matte
brow bone color or a matte blending
color would have been nice there it
isn't a bad palette it's just a palette
that I can't really get a complete look
for my skin tone out of maybe other
people will be able to work with it
better I'll reach for it just to get a
single shadow out if I don't think I can
find it in the current palette I'm
working for and I know that it's even
here I'll reach for it but very very
rarely do I reach for this palette even
though the shadows are very good quality
it's just the color selection that I'm
not a big fan of okay moving on to
products that I absolutely love I'm
going to move on to the blushes
highlighter and bronzer that I have the
blushes that I have the first one that I
got was down boy and I absolutely love
this blush the only thing about the face
products that I'm about to talk to you
about is you really have to use a very
fluffy brush if you use a very light
hand because they do get very powder if
you use a dense brush so you have to be
very gentle with it there's a swatch for
that and so watch it on my hand now I do
have that face primer on here so just
kind of keep that in mind so that is the
swatch for the down boy I'm just a
really nice rosy pink love that and then
I just recently purchased this in stain
blush this is supposed to be more
pigmented it is supposed to be
longer-lasting and I do agree with both
of those claims this is what it looks
like on the inside and this one is in
the color Argyle and I will show you
what that looks like
and there is that swatch for you really
really really nice product here I love
the bombs blushes they are quite famous
for their blushes moving on to the
bronzer this is also a recent purchase
and this is Bahama Mama and you can see
like the hot chick on the front so this
is what Bahama Mama looks like inside I
don't know if you saw but all of these
products all have mirrors inside which i
think is really really nice if you're
taking them on the go
here is the swatch of Bahama Mama if
chocolate Soleil by Too Faced and hoola
by benefit had a baby it would be Bahama
Mama and that's the swatch there I love
this for contouring but this is actually
also really good for summertime when I
want to like make it look like I'm a
little sunkissed when I'm not I do I do
plan on using this as a new purchase I
haven't used it for that but I have
tried it to see if it works and it does
so really really happy about this
purchase onto highlighter this is my
Holy Grail highlighter and I have talked
about it in many videos recently and
this is the mary lou manizer such as
such a pretty highlight
a champagne highlight again Mir I don't
want to blind you but a champagne
highlight it is shimmery but it is not
sparkly in any way it is a gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous highlight I love it if
I could marry mary-lou manizer I totally
would but I have a husband and she's
fictional so that's not going to happen
but I absolutely love this product and
if you haven't ever seen it or heard of
it you must be new to youtube videos
because this baby is everywhere I cannot
choose between these two of which one is
my favorite palette because I love them
for different reasons we'll talk about
matte first now this is the meet matte
nude palette and if you've watched
YouTube videos quite often you have seen
Matt before I love Matt because I feel
like if I need any kind of matte shade
to change up my look in any way if I
want to warm it up if I want to cool it
down if I want a matte matte transition
color if I want a brow bone color I've
got it in this palette as you can see
they're very large shadows and they make
a joke about it on the front it says
size matters
haha naked man size matters that's just
nothing this is just a really really
nice palette very highly pigmented
shadows I'll swatch a couple for you if
I can let's see let's do Matt wood
because that one's just buttery and
gorgeous we'll do Matt Malloy so you can
see the contrast there's Matt Malloy and
that wood and then we'll do Matt sing
just to give you something totally
different
okay there you go just gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous shadows you can see it's
getting late at night so I'm you can
tell my voice scarfs are love and Matt
absolutely loving him next pallet last
pallet I want to show you is the rock
star palette and this one is hilarious
in packaging as well the names of the
shadows are so funny I grew up during
this time well not the whole time but
this is all based on 1970s 80s and 90s
rock bands so it's nicknamed a-bomb Jovi
down here which i think is really cute
and it says living on a stair instead of
living on a prayer and then you open it
up inside and again you have a mirror
and you've got your twelve shadows
you're all named after bands in
and there's some classical music in the
middle down here you've got disco disco
which is a highlight which is very
similar it's just a little more golden
than mary-lou manizer and then this
corally pink pop pop don't you want me
blush down here which is genius the bomb
is one of the few few companies that
actually covers their lip products which
is wonderful thank you the ball if you
happen to be watching this people the
bomb thank you for doing that because no
one does that
so you've cut these lip sync duo in
milli and Vanilli and if you are younger
and you don't know who milli vanilli are
google it you want you will crack up at
this it's pretty funny a blush highlight
itself and the shadows are amazing let
me show you the stroke the stroke is a
beautiful black with some blue sparkle
in it I don't know if that's coming off
well or not hopefully is and then let me
show you Led Zeppelin that's another one
that's really fun to play with that is
eight hunter green with gold sparkles
and then we'll show you Alice Cooper
Alice copper excuse me haha and that one
is okay Bert a deep burgundy
with is there shimmers in that with some
silver sparkle in there but no fallout
on these very creamy very blendable
everything you would ever want a shadow
to be is these Kat Von D and the bomb
are my favorite eyeshadows of all time
the final product I want to show you
which is actually my absolute favorite
I've only ever seen this in one other
video and I will put a link to that
video down below oh I can't remember who
it was but recently I've seen this in a
video before that I'd never seen this in
a video and this is the time bulb
concealer and I absolutely love this
product it is a medium to full coverage
concealer it is not a super full
coverage concealer if you're just trying
to cover up some dark circles a little
bit of redness this concealer is amazing
this one is in light/medium which
matches my skin tone but I do find that
it covers up my red spots and it does
cover my dark circles very nicely I do
have one that I use if I want to lighten
my under-eye area but I would imagine if
I got one in light it would do very well
for that as well if I want to use it as
an under-eye
highlight but just a fantastic product
very very creamy
very long wearing not oily not greasy
i'm just wonderful wonderful product in
this so those are all of the products
that i own by the balm i hope you saw
some new discoveries maybe some other
things you want to try or some things
that you want to stay away from because
they're not your taste it no matter what
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up please
and make sure you subscribe if you'd
like to see more of my videos I do uh
