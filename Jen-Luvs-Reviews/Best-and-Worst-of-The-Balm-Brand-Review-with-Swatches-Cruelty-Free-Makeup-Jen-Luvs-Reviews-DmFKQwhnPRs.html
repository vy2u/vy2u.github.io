the ball brand review I've been
promising this video for months the
original the Boehm brand review is one
of my most viewed videos on my entire
channel of all time a girlfriend a
boyfriend that thing is old it needs an
update
yo I have brought you my the bomb
collection which looks a little bit like
like that it is big I am a collector of
the bomb it's the only brand that I
actually collect I know there are people
that collect two-faced and tart and
things but I don't collect those I have
quite a few things from those brands but
I don't collect them with the bomb I try
to get pretty much everything I don't
have everything like for example I don't
have the new meat Matador palette which
totally bums me out that I don't have it
for this video but I don't have it for
this video but I do have a lot to show
you and everything I'm going to show you
in the beginning of the video is still
available for purchase and then at the
end of the video I'll show you some
things that we're from the past in case
you happen to see them at Kohl's or all
oakerson like that and you want to
purchase them I will show you those as
well this video is in collaboration with
my friend Cara Lee over at Cara Lee
nifty and thrifty she is one of my what
tip in makeup reporter she is a
dedicated reporter she's been battling
colon cancer over the past month or so
so if you've been through that or you
know someone had been through that you
know what she's going through but she
still even though she's going through
all this taking the time to make a video
to do with me so I want to thank her so
much for collaborating with me on this
video she's going to be talking about
her opinions of her the balm products
over on her channel I will link that
down below for you so this is going to
be a very long video so I am going to
put time stamps stamps below in case
you're looking for a particular product
so we'll do lips first then cheeks than
eyes and then face products so let's go
ahead and start with lips and we're
going to start with a liquid lipstick
which is the meet Matt Hughes long
lasting liquid lipstick so I am going to
go ahead and show you swatches right now
of the colors that I have
I do have I believe I have eight of them
and I think there's 12 in the old line
and then I think they just released six
new ones I don't have any of the six new
ones let's talk a little bit about
formula so the formula of these they go
on very smooth they are a little patchy
on my dry lips but if you don't have
perpetually dry lips like I do they'll
probably go on pretty smooth because
they only seem to just kind of stick to
my dry patches a little bit but the rest
of it looks great lasting power is
pretty good it does wear away on the
inner part of the lip my biggest
complaint of these is the stickiness
there is always a little bit of stick to
them like for example this has been on
for maybe 10 minutes and you can see my
lips kind of stick together a little bit
it's not a lot I've definitely had
liquid lipsticks like the real her one
where my lips are like it's like a
little bit crazy glued together it's
just a little bit of a stick they are a
tad bit heavy in that I can still feel
them after I put them on the lips but
they don't feel extra drying but they
don't feel hydrating either
but I can definitely feel it when
they're on my lips for the entire time
that I'm wearing them
of course the further away you get from
your natural lip color the more you're
going to notice the wearing away of it
so you definitely want to bring it with
you in order to reapply overall I kind
of like this formula but it's definitely
not my favorite formula this is a
product that don't have anymore this is
the how about them apples palette it's a
lip and cheek palette I really didn't
like this I ended up trading it away on
a website called EDI I don't even know
if either even exists anymore but I
traded it away I remember what I tried
before but I really didn't like the
formula I felt like the blush really sat
on my cheeks and I really didn't like
them on the lips like the Coralie shades
were really bright and they just looked
they weren't my colors for lip colors or
what colors that I personally enjoyed
they were very oily I remember that that
they had kind of an oil base of them so
they were away pretty quickly off the
lips and I just didn't enjoy the way
they looked on the cheek so that's
definitely not a recommend from me next
up is to pick up lip liners I do really
like to pick up lip liners I think they
go on very
easily they can be a little bit dry some
of them are more dry than others I only
have three of them unfortunately but the
one this one this one that I have here
and the one you need I find this one to
be a little drier than the other two
that I own but they do go on it's just
some it takes a little bit of work with
that one to get it to go on to full
opacity but I do feel like it helps my
lipstick to stay on a bit longer and I
do enjoy the shades that I have I did
out of the ordinary amazing no but
they're good lip liners they're very
nice the read my lips lip glosses I
really like the lip glosses a lot I love
them because they have a lot of opacity
to them you can see in the swatches here
there is a lot of color pigmentation in
them and I personally enjoy that wash of
color look they go on very evenly they
have kind of a medium strength fruity
scent to them and they do feel a little
bit heavy on the lips on a tad bit
sticky but not really sticky just kind
of on like all the things people don't
like about glosses it's kind of like
middle of the road to a little mild on
them but you do kind of get those things
the stickiness the heaviness but I
really like the color of it and the
amount of pigment they put in it and the
opacity of it so this is actually
something I really really like a lot I
can't believe only have two of them next
is another one that I don't have anymore
and this is another one that I didn't
really enjoy this is the stay niak this
is supposed to be either a lip or a
cheek stain I found on my lips that any
kind of breakage or dryness it kind of
sunk into lines on my lips and really
accentuated those lines in the stain and
those the stain did not go away from
those lines so any color that was on my
lips would kind of fade away slowly but
then the cracks would still be there
accentuating them even further and then
on the cheeks it dried so fast it was
hard to get it to blend into the skin
nicely if you can work fast enough with
it on the cheeks I think it's very nice
it's just trying to get it to blend out
before it dries and stains but the
staining on the cheeks is very very nice
it's just that you it's hard to work
with and that it dries so quickly and it
stains so much
so you just kind of have to work really
fast with the product it's not a really
bad product but it's just not something
that I personally will repurchase man
this is so negative so far there's some
good stuff coming I promise the next one
is not though the good thing I don't
have these anymore either actually I
think I just ordered one from HauteLook
that you can get the balm 50% off on
HauteLook about four times a year and
they've also has sales so make sure you
sign up for their mailing list if you
want to know when they have their 50%
off sales so the Bond girls lipsticks I
ordered one of them and it broke
immediately after I bought it I ended up
getting my money refunded on HauteLook
for the purchase of the lipstick it
broke like right all and like it was
what what is happening so I never was
able to use it because it broke off at
the base so I don't really have enough
experience with these I should try them
again because I don't feel like I got a
chance to really to get to know them you
know what I mean I only remember what
they smell like or anything I can't even
tell you okay so now we get into some of
my more favorite products I feel like I
was such a negative Nancy in the lip
products but now we're going to get into
some good stuff the cheek product the
balm has fantastic cheek products first
one is Bahama Mama it is a more cool
tone neutral tone two cool toned bronzer
really really liked this is a bronzer I
also like it as a contour it kind of
reminds me a little bit of benefits
hoola a little bit but as you can see
that the hoola is a little bit warmer
toned but they're they're similar in
tone and they look similar on the skin
but you're going to get a more cooler
tone with Bahama Mama lasting power on
all the BOM cheek products is fantastic
they are some of my favorite cheek
products of all time and every single
thing that I mentioned today has
excellent lasting power and Bahama Mama
is definitely one of those next up we
got the Luminizer sisters I have two of
the Luminizer sisters my Cindy Lou broke
and I haven't reached on my Cindy
Luminizer but Cindy Luminizer is more of
a pink toned highlight it's a lot more
mild than some of their other
highlighters so if you like a more
subtle pink toned highlighter you're
probably really like Cindy Lou Betty Lou
is the bronzer type and
is probably going to be a nicer
highlight on like a deeper skin tone I
don't personally prefer betty-lou for my
skin tone it's shimmery I don't really
know what to do with her I put around my
cheeks and I just I don't know it just
kind of falls flat for me I don't really
like the warmer tone on it I don't
really like the shimmer on it betty-lou
just I don't think was made for me but
if you have a medium to deeper skin tone
you'll probably really really like her a
lot
mary'll Oh Oh Marilu how I love you Mary
Lou is my holy grail highlighter of all
time I don't think anything will ever
top Mary Lou just because now at this
point I have a sentimental attachment to
her she's like I love her so much she's
so beautiful laughing power is fantastic
I feel like this was the original Holy
Grail highlighter for most people that
got into highlighters before
highlighters became huge since if Mary
Lou was it was just everybody's favorite
now there's just so many options out
there there's so many great highlighters
out there but if you want a reliable
highlighter that's good for pretty much
everybody if you really deep skin you
probably won't like it very much as a
highlighter but it's pretty like I mean
I can't say enough good things about
this product you can also double these
as eyeshadows by the way all the blushes
you can double the eyeshadows if you
want to use that tone on your eyes I've
used Mary Lu on my eyes multiple times
and fantastic fantastic product next up
we have down boy and down boy with my
first of all blush I'm so sentimentally
attached to these products I don't know
why but this is such a beautiful shade
it's got kind of its pinkier than the
MALDI ones that I really really like
that that are my favorites that are a
little bit deeper but this just looks
beautiful on my skin tone I really enjoy
it again lasting powers fantastic on
these blushes and just a beautiful shade
if this calls to you I definitely
recommend it I also have a little sample
of frat-boy this one's a little bit more
quarterly just a little bit more a
little little softer a little dustier
and I do really like this a lot I feel
like it comes off more Coral
on the cheeks and it looks in the pan
and but I do like it it's just I just
have a baby though but I do like it a
lot and then my favorite the balm blush
formula or the in stains I three full
size and one little mini guy that I got
in a subscription box so this little guy
is called Swiss dot and then this one is
called pin stripe and then houndstooth
and Argyle the reason why I like these
the best is I feel like they're so
buildable you know you you start off
with a very light hand and then you just
kind of build it up to your desired
strength and I just love these shades
I love the lasting power they're just
beautiful beautiful blushes and I have
nothing bad to say about them they're
amazing
and finally in the cheek section we have
the highlight and contour palette it's
very very cute their packaging is
adorable if you haven't picked up on
that yet it's very cute there are four
lighter shades and then there's for
deeper safe Sochi
see so shades so these two are shimmery
highlighters one is more of a champagne
one is a little bit more of a peach your
peachy or pinky or kind of shade and
then there's two mattes
this one is more peachy tone and this is
more yellow tone so these are really
nice for setting the under-eye this
shade I personally really like for
contouring this one I use for matte
bronzing I'm sure there are lots of
people that can use an orange bronzer
but I rarely see people use them on
YouTube I'm sure that there are people
that do but I don't feel like this one
is one that I will ever use I mean I
guess maybe I can mix another blush with
it but this shade right here I
absolutely love these shades look
beautiful on everybody in my opinion if
you're very very fair you may not enjoy
this you probably use it with a very
light hand but it's beautiful it's a
wonderful wonderful color it gives you
the kind of that in from the cold and
kind of flush but overall all these
shades have worked wonderfully for me
I've really enjoyed them except for this
one right here just because I don't
prefer the tone moving on to the eye
product now the eye products are kind of
hit and miss for me so let's go ahead
and start off with the bombs away eye
makeup remover this stuff is fantastic
it's wonderful it gets off I makeup so
so stinking quickly it looks like this
at the inside this is my second one and
I haven't dug into this one as much
because I do have one that I'm working
on in my bathroom that someone had
gifted to me so I'm using that one until
that one's gone and then I'm going to
dig into this one more I keep this one
in my makeup room in case I need to
remove a very difficult to remove liquid
lipstick or eyeliner swatches things
like that that's why I have this in here
so I've used it just a little bit for
that purpose but it really is a
wonderful product now this is the thing
is you can get coconut oil just like the
coconut oil from the grocery store and
it'll do the same thing but I feel like
this works faster and easier than
coconut oil it's also less oily it's got
more of a substance to it so I don't
feel quite as greasy when I'm done using
it as using coconut oil but the end
result is the same I also really like
the tin that it's in the tin format the
only thing is I think there's something
wrong with this one because my
one didn't do this but the top comes off
very easily off of this one so I don't
like that but the one that I had before
it didn't have that problems I don't
know if it was just this batch or what
but just so you know that can happen
with these I don't like that but but
other than that I really really like
this product it's really wonderful this
is one that I've had for a very long
time this is the brow Pao I brought
outer and I have it in the shade dark
brown which is a great shade for me this
is my very first brow powder no I tried
the Anasazi at first and then I tried
this one it's really really good I like
it better than the Anasazi eyebrow
powder even though I do really really
like that one just because I feel like
the opacity is better on this and and
because it does put on so much color you
can split it through and then end up
with a lighter tone or you can make it
really dark if you want to so I love
this stuff lasting power of course is
wonderful it doesn't do anything weird
like stick to brow hairs or anything
like that
I do apologize for my unkempt brows in
the close-up I just didn't do my brows
today I didn't I was rushing I had a lot
of things going on today and I didn't do
my brows so if you got issue with my
brows I'm sorry I apologize moving on to
the meet matte palette I have meet
matrimony and I have meet Matt and nude
I really like the formula of both of
these palettes this one right here the
meet matte nude fantastic quality but
what you'll hear over and over again
from people that own this is they never
reach for and I think part of the reason
why I never reach for this is because of
the color selection the color selection
is very odd for creating a complete look
I wish that there was a champagne and
here instead we got this kind of yellow
toned matte shade which I do really like
but it's just kind of something that I
want to use for a reason instead of just
like an everyday easy look I just find
this palette the selection is kind of
not super easy to work with as far as
it's not completely intuitive for me I
have to really think about how I'm going
to put these colors together if I had
some advice for the balm I would say to
put these in rose just do a light amid
and a deep so that it's easier to see
how the shades can work together so that
way you know oh I can pull one of these
light shades with one of the medium
shades with one of the deep shades you
know put them together purposefully in
rows and then you know people can mix
and match if they want to but they can
get a look out of each road that would
be my suggestion for the bone for their
meat matte palettes but I do really
really like this formula a lot I feel
like the bomb's matte eyeshadow formula
is extremely strong
I use a meet matrimony on my eyes today
for the look that I'm wearing I don't
know how much you can see it cuz about
these big ol lashes on but I use Matt
Evans up in the crease I use Matt Thomas
all over my lid and then I use Matt
Moskowitz back up in the crease to kind
of give that purple on the outside and
up and then I use Matt Lin to blend out
the brow bone and that's all I did for
this look today and I really like how it
came out I feel like they kind of did
what I just said
for the other palette in this but we've
got the you know more deep shades and
not a lot of mid well you've got kind of
these two lighter shades up here and
then these mid-tone II kind of shades
here and then these four deep so I like
how they made it a little bit more
organized a little easier to follow I
definitely reach for this one more than
I reach for the meet matte nude but
quality wise they're phenomenal quality
really really good mess alright going
into the new tune in the nude nude the
new two came out first just like the
meet matte nude came out before the meet
matrimony there was a meet Matt before
the meet Matt nude but I don't have that
anymore I used to have it I don't have
anymore it's not available anymore but
this was my first purchase by from the
balm this was my first whole look
purchase I believe ever the black came
shattered so it's a hot mess of a
palette the quality the shadows is
wonderful I don't like the color
selection at all they've got these two
shades here that are very very similar
it definitely will give you more of like
a smokey look it's kind of hard to get a
lighter daytime look because you've
really only got these shades to work
with if you're my skin tone or maybe
even a little deeper but you've got
these beautiful deeper shades over here
if you are of a deeper skin tone or if
you like
nice dark smoky look so there is a lot
to work with here but it's not my
favorite shade selection even though the
quality is wonderful the they did much
better just like with the meat matrimony
they did much better with the nude nude
and I do have the naked man burrs and
there's a couple versions of them
there's a naked chick version and they
could man version then they got the
clothes chick first and the clothes man
version I believe I think so but this
shadow selection is much easier to work
with you can see they've included a lot
more lights and mid-tones in just a few
darks over here so I really like the
setup of it very easy to use it makes a
really nice gift for someone that
doesn't own a lot of shadow palettes
there's nothing magical in here I think
flirty is probably the most unique shade
in here but I mean it's a nice palette
and it works very well it's great
quality and I very much enjoy it now the
last palette that I have that is still
available is the balm voyage palette
this one I don't reach for like ever and
I don't know why well I do know why
because it has a similar problem as the
meet matte nude and that it's kind of
difficult for me to figure out where to
go up here yesterday because I wanted to
retry the talks that have been a while
so they use it yesterday I use
bienvenido and welcome over here on my
lid and the welcome shade really blended
out and didn't stay that TruGreen which
made me a little sad and it had been a
while since I've used it so I was glad I
did that but I mean this the shadows
just they don't perform as well I don't
think as the other formulas I don't know
what's going on here but I find that
like these shades over here they kind of
blend the true color of them kind of
blends away as you work with them which
I don't enjoy the cheek shades are
wonderful but you can see I've barely
touched them I don't know why but I've
used each one of them at least one but
they are consistent in quality from what
I remember I have not used a lip
products in here at all those are not
shades that I typically wear so you know
I can't really talk about those honestly
I really don't recommend this palette
just because I don't prefer the shadow
formula in here overall unless you're
buying it for the blushes you're buying
it for the blushes and then just kind of
play a little bit with the eyeshadows
and find but I don't feel
as a whole the palette is worth it the
last I shadow formula I want to talk
about is one that I really love a lot
and it's there over shadows and it took
me forever to buy these because I was
like over shadows I'm not even over
shadow I don't need an overcoat you know
like I don't need a glove you know I
mean like I thought it I didn't was
gonna be opaque I didn't think it was
gonna be fun oh they're wonderful
they're so good I have no money no honey
and I have work is overrated they're
both wonderful they are mineral shadows
though so some people don't like those
because it can create a little bit of a
mess there there's a lot of powder going
on you definitely want to tap off your
brush but the lasting power on these is
wonderful they applied super easily if
you really wanted to stick you can put
down it's like to face glitter glue or
something like that if you want to make
sure they really really stick but
overall just really really good I think
this is probably the least talked about
in the most underrated awesome product
by the balm of the over shadows I highly
recommend them I also have a few of
their eyeshadow sticks I have let's see
I have moon shots I have shut out and I
have curve ball they're all baseball
themed names I do really like these for
one and done I shadow looks but I do
feel like that they get lost if you try
to put powder eyeshadows over them I
don't feel like they keep their punch so
if you're like a one-and-done kind of
person where you just want to put a
little bit of call in your lids with an
eyeliner and mascara and you're done
you'll probably really really enjoy
these if you have oily lids you may want
to pass on these I feel like even with
my normal lids I start to see some very
light creasing through the day so just
be really careful with these if you do
have dryer lids you'll probably love
these they're very easy to use they're
very opaque they're fun to use I don't
reach for them a lot just because I
don't find that they work well with
powder eyeshadows but for one-and-done
they're very nice now we have the mister
right now eyeliners these are relatively
new newer in the bombs line I have two
of them I have Dean and Jack and I do
really like these for the upper lash
line and I really like the one in Jack
for the lower lash line I found
with the one in Dean because it's so
dark maybe I just can't see it with this
one since it's a little bit lighter a
little shimmery err it tends to travel
down underneath my lash line through the
day where I have to make sure I go to
the bathroom and check on it and wipe it
away so I really don't recommend these
for the lower lash line but they are
such a fine point and they are the
roll-up kind so if you like that for
your upper lid I definitely recommend
them but I can't recommend them for the
lower lash line or for the tight line
underneath even though they will work
initially they just kind of bleed down
through the day on me so I don't really
like that I did have the put a lid on it
I shadow primer I don't have it anymore
it's very similar to me to the Urban
Decay primer potion or the Too Faced
shadow insurance but I found it to be a
little bit oily or a little bit more
moist so again if you have oily lids it
might not work for you but if you have
drier lids you'll probably really like
it I definitely want to hear your
thoughts in the comments below if you've
tried these before but I really liked it
while I had it but I don't have it
anymore
next up the Schwing eyeliner I did not
use this today because this is super old
and it needs to be thrown away you
really should only keep liquid eyeliners
for the same amount of time as you keep
mascaras because they get bacteria in
them just like mascaras and this is way
over three months old this is probably a
year old it is the kind of dip liner and
I told the people the ball most if you
really need to do a pen liner because
you're not doing your line justice
without a pen liner but yet the dip
lines you the product is housed in here
and you have to dip the product I
definitely recommend you wipe off the
little brush before you apply it and I
do believe it is yeah it's a brush tip
it's very very pointy which I like it do
find that it seeps into fine lines so if
you don't have super taut eyelid you may
want to skip this one but if the line is
super super inky and black which is
great it's very easy to do a wing with
it they call it the Schwing because you
can like swing it up on the side of your
face I did really enjoy using this even
though I don't find it to be the easiest
liner to work with I find pen liners to
be easier just because it's so inky that
it can be messy to use and if you mess
up and you try to fix it it can
smudge and it's just kind of difficult
to use but if you're good at eyeliner
you probably will have no problem with
this at all it's just don't mess up
just don't mess up and you'll be I
unfortunately it's been so long since I
tried the body bodybuilder mascara I
don't feel comfortable talking about it
and I haven't tried any of their their
mascaras since then so I got a skip
mascaras sorry for face products let's
start with the tinted moisturizer that I
no longer have it's very light coverage
so if you like a very light coverage
tinted moisturizer you'll probably
really like it I really liked it I used
to use it too deep and up I had my shade
that's too dark for me that I had I used
to use it to deepen up my other
foundations worked great for that works
great for a really nice light base for a
light makeup day and I enjoyed it a lot
you want something a little more
coverage you can go well a lot more
coverage actually you can go for the
timebomb foundation this is a full
coverage foundation no doubt about it
it's definitely full coverage full
coverage looks crazy on me so you'll see
in my little demo right here I build it
up to like medium to full ish coverage
but it's really opaque very thick
formula my favorite way to apply it is
with a beauty sponge I just kind of dab
it in there and pop it all over my face
and I feel like it works great like that
you can also use a brush you can use a
regular flat top kabuki or you can use
one of the new ish not normally new or
you can use like an artiste style brush
like those paddle brushes that like have
all the bristles that works really well
for this and I don't personally reach
for this that often because I do find
that through the day it will seep into
my wrinkles on my forehead and you'll
see like a crease of foundation in my
forehead but if you don't have that
you'll probably be just fine if you're
looking for just a full coverage
foundation and don't have that problem
the lasted her on this is wonderful
others in that aspect but I do like it
it's just I don't like the creasing in
my forehead at all well another one my
favorite product from the balm which I
think is totally underrated as their
concealer the balms concealer is
phenomenal this is my second concealer
that I've gotten from them this is in
the shade light/medium and
it's wonderful the courage of it is
fantastic the blend ability is fantastic
it's more of a hydrating concealer
there's a lot of this stuff now that I'm
talking about it's like everything that
I'm seeing sounds like it will be good
for drier skin it's very hydrating and I
really like it a lot because the
coverage is good lasting power is great
it doesn't seep into the creases I have
a little bit of fine lines under my eyes
I don't select accentuates those at all
really really love this concealer a lot
I definitely recommend let me nice brand
new to their line are the photo bomb
powder foundations I have worn this by
itself and really enjoy it by itself
it's got a very light coverage by itself
but it's really nice to put it over a BB
cream or attented moisturizer if you
just want to beef up the coverage a
little bit you'll see I did put it on
today overtop of the full coverage
foundation and it made it even more full
coverage foundation because I hadn't put
on a full coat of the foundation so it
really built up the coverage I do feel
like it mattifies the face to an extent
but not over mattify it doesn't make me
look completely flat and I really like
this a lot I've been very much enjoying
it and as a powder foundation just by
itself it has a nice lasting power it'll
last me a good six hours by itself
before it's gone powder foundations just
don't last that long on me so I don't
have high expectations for lasting power
for a powder foundation by itself but I
have been really enjoying this for what
it is I like it I like it a lot oh and
my shade here that I've been using is
light I forgot to mention the primer I
used to have the primer there's a
picture of it there I did really liked
it it is a silicon based primer I like
it better than the Smashbox one because
I feel like it's more hydrating than the
Smashbox one which is weird for a
silicon-based primer because they don't
feel like silicon based primers are
necessarily hydrating but I felt like
that one had some hydration to it which
was kind of odd and I did feel like it
made my makeup last longer not a
ridiculous amount longer but definitely
longer and really enjoy it while I had
it so before I go I just want to show
you the rest of my collection of things
that are no longer available on their
website but you may be able to find them
elsewhere on at Kohl's or on whole look
things like that so I've got these
eyeshadow palettes first is the rockstar
palette
and this one was a favorite for a while
but again the shade selection was kind
of difficult to work with and figure out
the way that I wanted to use it I had to
really think to know what I wanted to do
with it these two shades are both
beautiful this one's very very light
it's probably the lightest least
pigmented blush that I found from their
line but it works well on my skin tone
but I don't know if it would work well
for everybody and then the lips down
here these are the milli vanilli lip
sync playback we've got a lighter shade
darker shade for me the lighter shade
was more me but mixing them together was
also very nice the balm a petite palette
I did not enjoy this is my least
favorite eyeshadow palette of their from
their formula you can kind of open that
up when I when I showed this originally
I didn't know that it came open but it
does these shades right here the
shimmery shades are very different I
feel than their previous eyeshadow
formulas I found that these were
difficult to get the shadows to work
together kind of like I was talking
about with the ball boy wash palette it
was just kind of difficult and and the
shade selection was kind of odd I don't
I don't really understand where this is
going because I guess I could put the
Grey's with the pinks I guess I don't
know it's just kind of an odd selection
I didn't use it a whole lot of use it
maybe three or four times and I was like
I don't know about this one and then we
have the balms eye palette this one was
really fun to work with if you like
those mermaid kinds of shades supposed
to be like on a boat kind of feeling and
I really like this this one right here
high tide very glittery and I had the
same problem with some of these deeper
shades kind of blending away so you have
to be really careful not to over blend
them these shades down here are really
neat you have the curve in angled brow
shadow so of course I use the shade
woody and I love it and then the catch a
wave use wet or dry I didn't end up ever
using those wet though so I can't speak
to that I'm sorry but I did use them dry
and they're very pigmented very very
pigmented and then down here they have
some like different guides and things
for like winged liner and brows and
stuff I can't use that stuff I tried
there's even directions I tried I
couldn't figure it out so I
gave up I just realized I forgot to show
you the nail polishes I have two nail
polishes by the balm these are great
nail polish is another very underrated
nail polish brand I never heard anybody
talk about the balms nail polishes
they're great
the last close to a week without
significant shipping they're really
really nice formula they're very opaque
no crazy very strong smell or anything I
have a huge nail polish collection I'm
very addicted to nail polish I'm very
picky about my nail polish but I will
say I really like the balms polishes so
now the last thing this is the weirdest
thing that I still own by the balm this
is called the hair mascara and I know
that they've seen these kinds of things
in drugstores but I've never tried any
of them except for this one I've never
tried any other hair mascara so I have
no basis of comparison but this one
works I'll tell you at work it covers up
my grades very nicely but I will also
tell you it makes my hair feel very very
like sticky almost hairsprayy and it
does transfer also if you touch your
head or if you wear a hat or something
then the color comes off on your hand or
on your hat it so basically it works but
I don't recommend it just because of
that transferring is really not good and
the feel of it it feels really gross it
washes out of the hair very easily
though I will say that about it but I
don't really like it very much and so I
hope that you were able to find
