been getting beauty boxes for seven
months
hello my friends so I have officially
been getting beauty boxes for seven
months and I originally shot this for
six months and then the video came out
blurry so now I've gotten my seven
months worth of stuff so now you can see
an extra month worth of my favorite
things now I have like 18 products to go
through so I'm going to zip through
these as quick as I can but I want to
show you the best of the best of the
beauty box stuff that I've got I'm gonna
break this up by box so the first one
I'm going to start with is sample
society I would subscribe to that until
November yeah I was only subscribed that
for three months so I have a lot less
stuff but I didn't like that one very
much so that's another reason why I have
less stuff so here are the three
products that i got from sample society
that i loved the first one was this
Borghese lip gloss and i know they sell
this brand at costco but I've never seen
their lip gloss at costco and this is in
the color fee or a smells like fruit
punch love that let me swatch that for
you my dears and you can see already
it's got a stickiness to it so if you do
not like sticky lip gloss you will not
like this one but I don't care about
sticky lip gloss so I do enjoy it very
nice color love the color on that's like
a maulvi the next thing I liked was
actually a skincare item and that's
pycelle suitable and is there biomedical
skin treatments extremely gentle skin
and cleanser the reason why I like this
so much is because jeffer like wash your
face got like like um a mask face where
you like your skin feels so tight back
you wash your face I hate that feeling
and this did not make me feel that way
so really like this unfortunately the
full-size is really ridiculously
expensive so I will not be purchasing a
full size of this i'm looking for a
cheaper version of something that's like
this if you know of anything let me know
because i would love to have something
like that the last thing I got from
sample society that I loved was this
little octane hand lotion cream menace
dry skin hand cream and I really didn't
love this for myself but I loved it for
my daughter she has very very dry hands
in the wintertime and this whatever her
hands are the worst put this on her
hands before she goes to bed and she
wakes up in the morning and her hands
are beautiful typical lotion smell
thing fantastic but works amazing i know
the full price of this is very expensive
so I've been like savoring the last bits
of this sample society is fifteen
dollars a month now moving on to beauty
box 5 which is ten dollars a month if
you get it for three months if you get
just one month it's $12 first this
inverness a loose eyeshadow it's a
mineral shadow it is by silk naturals
and the color is Inverness hopefully you
can see how gorgeous that is it's just a
shimmery purple it's got some glitter in
it and it transfers to the lid very well
where sometimes I find purple eye
shadows end up looking kind of grey once
they're on your lid this one's really
nice because it actually looks purple
the next thing I got was some argan oil
and one thing that I realize about
different trying different kinds of
argan oil is that they're all they all
seem to be the same whether you get it
from sally beauty whether you get it
from josie maran whether you get it from
Morgana mark Daniel I mean they're all
one hundred percent argan oil I haven't
seen any difference between the
different kinds of argan oil I just ran
out of this one and I've had it since
October don't like this directly on my
skin but I do like it um squeeze into my
moisturizer I've used argan oil as a
hair treatment kind of like a hair mask
and washed it out and I have noticed a
moisturizing difference when I do that
but if I just put a little bit in my
hair I don't seem to notice it as much
as if I like soaked my hair and then
wash it out next thing was this model
code lip gloss and I know that there
were different colors given out in
different beauty boxes around the same
time it's got this mirror and this one
is in striptease it looks sticky but
it's not I promise it smells like
straight-up strawberries like strawberry
candy else watch it not pigmented um
it's a little bit of a peach tone but
it's definitely not pigmented and not
sticky I would say it's very
moisturizing it's more of an oily kind
of healing but the smell is amazing
lasting power is so-so but I did really
really enjoy this especially because it
just smells us think of good and it you
know it goes nicely
over any lipstick that I just want to
gloss up so one product that I wanted to
hate was this Pharaoh cosmetics blush in
Desert Rose I wanted to hate this
product and let me show you why I wanted
to hate it do you see that I don't know
if you can see that but there is powder
already rising from this container just
by twisting it they didn't put one of
those filters one of those screens on
top so as soon as I opened it there was
product all over the outside of it and
it made me so mad I was like this
company is so unprofessional as the
first thing I thought then I tried this
blush and it happens to be absolutely
beautiful so it made me mad that they
don't know how to package their products
but they did make a really good product
I'm going to scoop some of this off the
side so that you can see what it looks
like how pretty that is it's like a
corally pink and it's just gorgeous it's
a really really pretty blush and I
wanted to hate it but I don't I love it
I just wish they'd get their act
together on their packaging next up was
a product that I loved so much that I
ended up spending a bunch of money on
their website which was this everyday
minerals it's not a blush brush it's a
flat top brush but I use it for blush
because it just happens to work well for
that and I needed a blush brush at the
time since then I've gotten one of their
they're angled blush brush I use that
for contouring and I love that too I
would highly recommend the everyday
minerals brushes they aren't amazing
they're extremely dense they're
extremely soft and I love them the last
thing i want to show you from you to box
5 is something that i just got this
month and this is the only thing I've
tried of the products from this month so
far and it was the tree hot shave extra
rich moisturizing lotion and tropical
mango it's just a really nice lotion and
my daughter when her hands aren't as bad
have we been using this and she really
enjoys it I really enjoy it it's nothing
spectacular but it's not a slimy lotion
and that's what I really like about it
it's just the nice moisturizing lotion
without feeling like you're greasing
your hands all right onto FC which is my
favorite this was the first thing that I
really loved from Ipsy and this is the
Carol's Daughter monoi repairing split
end sealer and when I first started
using this I didn't really notice any
difference because I didn't have any
issues with my hair it's like giving
someone a lurgi medicine that doesn't
have allergies it didn't really do
anything for me now that I've colored my
and I've been flat ironing on more i've
been using my nume curling one more and
my ends are starting to get more fried
and now i'm noticing a difference when i
use this comes out like a cream and I'll
show I didn't put any on so I can show
you what how it works so you can kind of
see that it just kind of smoothes my
ends together and i love it i think it
looks so pretty I'm sure the full price
of this is very expensive when I run out
of it I may or may not buy a full-size
we shall see next thing we got which
everybody loves this stuff is the on the
bomb I shadows they're really really
nice you just got to be gentle with your
brother all she will create a lot of
fallout and this is a little teeny tiny
baby mat well maybe meet Matt and it is
in the color matte Batali which is a
dark brown stays on all day it's just a
beautiful color that I kind of I blended
it into my outer corner i blended up
into my crease sometimes if I want a
more dramatic look but really really
enjoy that and one thing I love about it
is it's actually got a little magnet
there to hold it closed which i think is
absolutely genius and really nice of
them to put in there the next epsy
product that i loved was this marvelous
Moxie by bare minerals lip gloss and
this is in the color daredevil okay we
got this in November so this was going
into the holiday season so this was
really nice to have this really true
berry colored gloss smell is kind of
vanilla ink you can see how pigmented
that is not sticky not as oily as the
model code one just but not really
moisturizing either but a nice nice
gloss um it does have the mint eNOS to
it that plumping stuff in there so if
you don't like that you won't like this
but I don't mind it and I didn't really
really enjoy this it's about half gone
I've got it like right there I used to a
lot this winter next up was my favorite
discovery of 2012 for mascara which was
the their benefit they're real mascara
really love this my only complaint about
it is it does kind of clump my lashes
together a little bit
but it gives me that real long thick
false lash look um and I really really
love isn't we got this one in November
and I just don't want to throw it away I
don't want to throw it away so I haven't
and I know that's bad but I'm I start
getting eye infections I promise it will
go on the trash probably along with all
my other mascaras but I just can't bear
to part with it and I can't bear to
spend full price on it maybe one day
I'll get another one of these sizes in a
kid or something and then um then I can
part with the old one um but there's
still prior to hear I don't want to
throw it away do you know what I'm
saying you ever feel that way about a
mascara you can't throw it away because
you just love it too much and too
spensive next up was from the December
bag which was fantastic I talked about
this in my most recent video we're
talking about my current favorites which
is the Mirabella primer it is a silicon
primer but I just absolutely love the
way this makes my makeup look I love the
way it feels all of those good things we
also got in that bag one of my favorite
liners eyeliners which is the Urban
Decay 24-7 liner in zero this is
actually not the one that I got in my
bag that one actually got given away to
pretty mean gumbo who was one of my
subscribers of the month that is in the
mail to her at this point so I hope she
enjoys that this is a fantastic liner
very smooth to go on I've heard mixed
reviews as far as it's staying in the
water line but I stays in my waterline
very nicely just very creamy not the
blackest black ever but just very easy
to go on and I've had this for probably
a year and it's never and it's not dry
at all would recommend this if you
happen to be in the market for a
high-end eyeliner three more things my
friends um the pacifica Tuscan blood
orange body butter this is another thing
I use on my daughter's dry hands works
beautifully the smell is amazing and
we've been using this a lot lately we've
been using this every night and her
hands haven't gotten dry since we've
been using this every night we haven't
had to use the lock team because this
has been taking really good care of her
so good stuff on this and I think you
can get this at target so I already
talked about argan oil this was a josie
maran
one that we got again I haven't seen any
difference between this and the other
three argan oils that I've tried I don't
think there's a point in buying
specifically this high-end one just by
any argan oil you can get your hands on
and it'll do the exact same thing if you
want to try it for your face your nails
your hair whatever last thing I just
show you is the my beauty gel liner and
this has become my new favorite I do
still love my bobby brown one I use it
the other day but this one is just so
much blacker you can see when i dip my
brush in it that it really makes some
deep marks in there because it gets some
such a soft liner and i'll show you the
kind of mark this makes in comparison
with that Urban Decay liner alright so
you can see this one you might be able
to see hopefully you can see this one's
a little bit blacker than this one and
then it's the gel consistency which to
me using a brush is easier to control
than a pencil you'll really get a nice
fine line with them with a nice thin
brush where a pencil a lot of times for
me is a little bit thicker a little
harder to apply so that is it from my
favorites of beauty boxes for the past
seven months I hope that was helpful for
you gave you kind of an insight into the
kind of things that you get in the
different three different beauty boxes
