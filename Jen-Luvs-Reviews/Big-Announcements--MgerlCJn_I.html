doing why are you quitting your job you
know are you going to be doing a lot of
sponsored content because you need to
keep your head above water my friends
welcome to my channel update video I
have so many things I want to tell you
so many exciting things happening on the
channel that I cannot wait to share with
you two major changes going on in my
life right now the first one I am going
on a long vacation with my family you
may or may not know that three to four
weeks on the road with the fam going
across the United States and back we're
kind of looping around to the north and
then going down through the south and
back up to Maryland where I live the
first thing I want to tell you is that
some people were very concerned about
what's up in makeup because people
really count on their sunday news show
for what's been makeup and whether that
would continue while I'm on vacation and
it is going to continue but in
abbreviated versions I've given my my
crew my team the month off so they can
either submit things for the show or not
it's up to them so I'm pretty much going
to be running the show on my own and I'm
really just going to be bringing you the
most important thing so like if you're
comes out with a new lip balm I probably
won't talk about it but you know if
there's a brand new collab with you know
whoever and whoever i will probably
mention it if it's like a big clap
things like that I'm going to try to
keep the show to between five to ten
minutes of just like the most important
biggest things and then they will
they'll go back to regular form once I
get back from my vacation the other
thing about the road trip is I'm going
to be doing a lot more vlogs for the
next month and if you don't enjoy blogs
just know that the regular content is
coming back when I come back so I'm
going to give you what I can give you
from the road I'm not a hundred percent
sure exactly what I'm going to be able
to give you but I do have a lot of
people have requested the video of why I
quit teaching that's going to happen
while I'm on the road I'll do that video
also I have a few more review videos
coming out that I'm very excited to
share with you I pre-recorded my
graveyard girl a swamp queen palette
video that's going to be up early next
week but there's gonna be a lot of vlog
so just know that that is not going to
even norm on the channel from now on
that's just what I'm going to be doing
while I'm on vacation the other thing I
want to mention is that while i'm on
vacation since i'm traveling across the
country i would love to do some meet ups
with you guys so i came up with a list
of some cities that we are naturally
traveling through and what i need from
you is if you live near one of these
cities and you're interested in doing a
meetup what i would love to know is
where is a good place in your town to do
a meetup or in these cities to do a
meetup so that i know you know you know
your city this is the first time i've
ever been to your city so you know your
city I'm not guaranteeing that I would
be meeting up in every one of these
cities but the more people to comment
down below for certain cities the more
likely i am to do a meet up there so
here are the different cities
Indianapolis Indiana Kansas City Kansas
Colorado Springs Colorado Yellowstone
Wyoming I salt lake city utah Flagstaff
Arizona albuquerque new mexico dallas
texas either New Orleans Louisiana
either tallahassee florida or
jacksonville florida savannah georgia
myrtle beach south carolina and virginia
beach virginia are the major cities that
i'll be travelling through so if you
want to vote for me to do a meetup down
in one of those cities please let me
know in the comments below the way that
this is the thing though this is not
like the focus of this trip is going to
be my family not the meetup so I'm not
setting specific dates or times where
I'm going to be certain places what
we're going to have to do is on the road
we're going to have to keep in touch
through social media you're going to
need to follow me on at least one social
media outlet so either periscope Twitter
Instagram or the facebook group what's
up in makeup it's group / what's up in
makeup so any of those places I'm going
to be putting the updates on all of
those places you don't feel like you
have to follow me everywhere just pick
whichever ones you like and those are
the ones that you're going to need to
follow me on in order to know where the
neat ups are going to happen I just
don't want to put that kind of pressure
on myself or my family I want to be able
to enjoy myself and I know that I need
to be in savannah georgia in on the
specific day i'm going to be stressed
out and making sure we get there and I
don't want to do that so I'd rather make
decisions on the road as we go it'll
also depend on what time we're going to
be arriving in a certain town because I
don't want to spend you know too much
extra time just sitting around and
waiting for the meetup to happen if that
makes sense so keep in touch with me on
social media and we'll get it all worked
out and again I'm not guaranteeing I'm
stopping in every single one of these
cities but I want to hear your feedback
about the city's down in the comments
below hopefully that makes sense if not
comments down below it will answer
whatever I can so that's the first big
thing I wanted to tell you the second
big thing is if you do not know I did
resign from my job as a teacher to do
YouTube full time I am so excited about
it you tube is like my dream job I loved
teaching I did it for 11 years and I
loved it but I think it's time for me to
do something different and that is going
to be YouTube full-time content on the
channel is going to pretty much stay the
same but with additional things so one
thing I really want to bring back is
Pinterest Buster's back a long time ago
I did like five videos doing pinterest
test I want to say this was like three
years ago and I call it pinterest
busters like Mythbusters and I want to
bring that back to the channel because
those were so much fun but they were it
was hard kind of hard for me to
coordinate them with the full time job
and the kids and everything so now I've
time to dedicate to it so i want to
bring pinterest busters back i also want
to do more reviews kind of like the
jeffree star review that you saw where I
do the I talked about the palette I do
the tutorial piece and then I do the
review piece I also want to do some more
all day wear tests on things that matter
like foundations lipsticks things like
that where where time is really really
important I'm going to do more of those
I'm also thinking about doing some more
lifestyle II kinds of things I've had
some people tell me that I have very
interesting and helpful opinions on
marriage relationships raising kids
things like that so if you are
interested in that kind of content I
would love feedback down below about
that because you know that's not really
makeup related and this is called Jen
loves reviews and me
you know parenting advice isn't really a
review thing so it doesn't really fit
with the content that I'm traditionally
putting up so I love your honest
feedback on that or whether you would be
interested in more lifestyle e stuff if
I may just start a second channel
eventually for more lifestyle leave
family vlogs things like that eventually
but for now it would go on this channel
so I love your feedback on what you
think about doing things like that
because I'm really not sure I'm kind of
on the fence on that one but what you
really need to know the meat and
potatoes of what I'm trying to tell you
is that there's going to be not really
different content but additional content
the content is going to be the same but
then there's going to be more of it so
I'm really excited about bringing you
guys more reviews and more information
more tutorials because I'm getting more
confident with those and just giving you
more content and I'm super excited about
it one thing that I've been getting
that's kind of personal some comments is
about financially but people are like
Jen what are you doing why are you
quitting your job you know are you going
to be doing a lot of sponsored content
because you need to keep your head above
water and the answer is no I'm not going
to be doing a lot of sponsored content
just to make money I'm still gonna be me
and nothing is going to change I mean
think about like when emilynoel83 quit
her job as a newscaster she's still the
same person i'm not changing either i
actually just got an email from a
company about doing a review of best
fiends the app and i'm not doing that
don't worry it's not going to the
channel no diet pills no you know t not
nothing weird okay i'm only gonna review
things for sponsorship that I genuinely
think you're interested in and that will
allow me to do an honest review I'm not
changing no worries we don't need money
that bad my husband has a fantastic
business that makes plenty of money that
we're going to be all right without me
selling out okay so don't worry about it
but that was the last thing I wanted to
tell you guys it was mainly just kind of
those those two major things with a
little side note about how my contents
not really going to I'm not
changes will be good so I want to thank
you guys so much for being here I thank
you being part of the community here I I
hope you're having fun here I hope your
meeting a lot of friends and I hope to
meet some of you guys in the next few
weeks I think that's going to be amazing
you know I'm really looking forward to
it so thank you so much for being here
and mad love and I will see you in the
next video very very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
