this on where have you been using it on
hello my friends welcome back to the
birch box now and I am so excited to be
back doing the Smackdown this month
I love the SmackDown it's one of my
favorite videos to film because I get to
do with this guy that's my husband John
st. John hi John yeah I knew he was
gonna do that that's stupid right that
was yeah that's okay
so Birchbox smackdown is when we compare
the women's box to the men's Bob my box
is $10 a month my box is $20 a month so
his must be twice as awesome in order to
beat mine so let's go ahead and get into
the birch boxes now we've both tried our
products in our boxes so we can also
give you some reviews which is awesome
so let's go hang into this store I think
I went first last month do you want to
go first this month I will go first it's
not alright this is my Birchbox and this
month first box is sponsored by the
league which is a funny show on TV about
fantasy football if you're into that
sort of thing it's a semi scripted show
I found out so some of it is like AB
lived which is lit ad libbed have a
limited have a limited and so they say
funny stuff and sometimes it's not
written it's okay sometimes I guess yeah
watching so I open it up this is the
October 2014 box and they call it
fanfare look it has some Dale's Pale Ale
which is wonderful and some guacamole
which is amazing and always want makes
me want tacos and some tortilla chips
YUM
all right what's the Birchbox the first
product that I'm gonna pull out is Jack
Black pure clean daily facial cleanser
and this is a multitasking cleanser and
toner that removes deep down grime for
smoother and clearer skin and I happen
to really like Jack Black products I've
used a handful of them I really like
their grapefruit
lip balm lip balm it's amazing so this
cleanser right here it gives you like a
really nice lather in your hands and
then you work it on your face it's not
gritty or anything like that so it's not
like an exfoliator it's just a nice
gentle kind of daily cleanser all right
so some of y'all been talking lately
about how Birchbox does repeats now when
I think I'm a repeat I think of like new
Beauty test to where they send me the
exact same stuff over and over again
what I think y'all are telling me is
that maybe you got it in your box a year
ago or a few months ago or last month
you got one of the products that I'm now
getting I feel like Birchbox is doing
that they're kind of rolling over
products but I haven't gotten the same
repeat product until now and it's kind
of okay let me show you what it is you
guys are gonna laugh if you're used to
watch my videos I got the Sophie facial
cleanser exfoliating foaming cleanser
now if you know me you know that this is
my favorite cleanser I actually did a
review video what we did for the
Birchbox shop and this was one of the
products that I chose because I had
gotten it in a birch box previously and
loved it so we got one in a full-size
and now I've gotten this again so I am
not complaining because I love this
cleanser it's got a sugar scrub inside
of it and it's really nice it feels
great on the skin it's got a very thick
coarse sugar feeling and when you put it
on your face if some happens to drip
into the corners of your mouth it's like
drinking lemonade it tastes delicious
and if I could drink this and eat this I
probably would it's amazing but it is a
repeat product for me so just
information for you all as far as
Birchbox as a whole I'm personally
thankful to have it because I cannot
have enough of this cleanser it's my
fave that it's pretty good yes you like
it - I do yes
okay so the second product that I'm
gonna pull out is dust boom industries
that's bone boom das old check this out
bay rum smoke and dirt everything body
wash now
that sounds interesting right you're
like smoke
dirt this is a all-over cleanser made
with algae and smoky charcoal for the
jet who gets his hands dirty so this was
automatically interesting to me just
because of the description right I think
that that's why they do it
smoking dirt women but throw it in the
trash man they're like yes smoking dirt
so I used the Jack Black product on my
face and I use this on the rest of my
body this had like a really spicy kind
of manly scent as the description
prepared it smell like smoke and dirt no
it doesn't smell like smoke and dirt I
smell an undertone of smoke though I do
like a very very gentle undertone of
smoke smooth MOOC is that song I don't
know it doesn't know jay-z get at me
yeah I don't know it's definitely it's
definitely like a manly pungent spicy
kind of kind of scent to it it allows
nicely it feels good when you're washing
not this reminds me of chlorine a little
bit no come on and say it's chlorine
smelling smelling it's not like chlorine
a little bit oh it smells like a pool no
it does not smell like a pool it does to
me no that's my opinion it does would
repurchase probably maybe I don't know
happy to have it yes okay sounds good
okay then next the next product I want
to show you on the air of repeats here
is this one and this is the be kind body
lotion and the reason why this is funny
is because you know if you saw the
Smackdown last month
you saw this because it was in Jon's box
which this is very very interesting and
it happens to be a really nice lotion I
love the way it seeps into my skin I
love the way it feels it does smell like
what did we say that it smells like
pledge pledge yep still smells like
pledge but pledge ish but I do like it I
mean it's okay I'm cool with it because
of the way it feels the weight
moisturizers will I buy a full-size
probably not but I will like it and
enjoy it while I have it okay so my next
product
that I will show you is basics for men
by Beckman and anybody who knows the
Camille Beckman products this is from
that company I love you have gotten some
other products and loved them this is
the ultimate tough skin relief this is a
glycerin powered formula that heals
damaged skin without leaving behind a
greasy finish
massage into dry elbows calloused hands
or any chapped skin in need of some TLC
so I have been using this on where have
you been using it on my dead lift my
knees and yeah so I have been using this
product on my shins and on my knees not
so much of my elbows I don't have that
ashy elbow thing going on
but in the gym when I deadlift and I
pull I don't know if you guys will be
able to relate to this or not but when I
pulled the barbell up when I deadlift it
scrapes against the tops of my shins and
the front of my knees which get pretty
banged up they say that you know it
doesn't leave a greasy finish and it
certainly does it when you pour it out
it feels like super Looby and greasy but
when you work it into the skin it
definitely helps to hydrate and kind of
replenish that healthy skin feel without
leaving like a weird kind of slippery
residue so my next product these are the
two products found in the pillow pack
was clean rain which is a perfume okay
so the smell is very clean it does have
a very mild sweet scent which surprised
me let me put it on my skin because I
haven't put on my skin in a while and
just make sure I test it out a little
bit
it's definitely a women's perfume it
definitely doesn't smell manly in any
way and some of the clean stuff smells a
little manly to me a little sweet this
one's definitely more fresh almost like
a like a grapefruit citrus see it says
inspired by falling droplets this fresh
scent blends water lily daffodil and
melon it's the melon that I smell no
need to go chasing waterfalls that's a
good one I don't think I'm be chasing
waterfalls but I'm gonna I'm definitely
gonna be using this though because I do
really enjoy it and I like perfume
samples I know a lot of people don't
like them but I like them so I was very
thankful to have this me yes yes alright
so I will show you my cologne sample
that I got because every month I get a
cologne sample and I'm very thankful for
that because I do really enjoy getting
new scents every month from Birchbox
this is from a brand that I've used that
I've gotten from Birchbox before this is
Atelier Cologne but this is a different
scent this is Santa Carmen cologne
absolute a soulful sophisticated
fragrance from top notes of bergamot to
a base of Indian papyrus how dab a very
small amount on each wrist a little goes
a long way and avoid rubbing it in which
is interesting because I've always kind
of like rubbed before and like now I
mean now I'm dabbing instead of rubbing
because I read this and I feel informed
now oh it's like it's a spicy manly like
it's very seasonally appropriate I
really enjoy the scent not a warmth to
it no a little bit of a sweetness to it
that I wasn't I'm surprised because it
smells in here like alcohol but then
when you put it on it doesn't smell like
alcohol at all it's definitely manly but
it's got a really nice set oh you need
to wear this one mmm I like that one
right so very happy to have this this is
awesome and apparently I like that one
alright my next product kind of made me
a little irritated and it's not that
against the cup well it is kind of
against the company a little bit because
it's like come on really okay this is by
dr. lip and this is the original nipple
balm for lips it's a hundred percent
natural okay because this is lanolin
okay and if you have ever given birth to
children and nurse children you know you
can buy something called Lana so and
Lana so or a generic brand or
whatever other brand you may buy is to
help soothe the way you feel after
nursing this stuff is amazing it's
fantastic it's very thick so if you put
it on your lips it feels very heavy and
thick but if you have any kind of
Chapman is going on it is gonna take
care of it and be amazing like suffered
through the thickness ladies but this is
the thing the full size of this is 1450
and that's not the same as the full-size
Lana so I'll put all the details of how
it measures up but basically this is a
ripoff as far as the price of this this
is stupidly overpriced
go to Target get the lana salt it's the
same stinking stuff it's just marketed
differently but it's the same stuff so
that's why I'm a little irritated with
this it is a fantastic product if you've
got super chapped lips going into the
winter like this is wonderful to have
something like this in your purse in
case you're just dying alright now if
you watched last month's Smackdown the
lifestyle products that I got were crap
for me so it was a tie bar in a pocket
square which okay if you dress up
everyday you're a fancy man that's cool
they just weren't things that made me
happy now
Jennifer was like well what do you want
Birchbox to send you and I was like man
if they sent me like a pocket knife
instead of a pocket square and the funny
thing is that I got this box before that
video went live so it's not like
Birchbox saw the video and was like oh
listen this man a pocket knife or
something but what showed up in my box
this month and I'm taking this out of
the package but I put it back in just to
show you how it's packaged here in this
neat little like kind of water-resistant
they sent him a pocket knife he looks
wished for it he looked manifested
they're not gonna like that anybody
who's seen the secret it's working right
here he manifested the parking spaces
pocket knives all that manifesting this
is true utility framework mini
this is a pocket-sized stainless-steel
gadget featuring 11 essential tools like
pliers and assault this I throw in my
everyday
bag this is awesome it's got like a
little mini set of pliers on here
everything that you would expect to have
on here
knife little screwdrivers can opener
there's even a little thing here where
you can attach it to your keyring if you
like that sort of thing epic this is
awesome
so pretty excited to have this this
right here makes the value of the box
for me each box dude you came through
this month what's up he was so excited
he's like like Jen you would not believe
what is in my box you would not believe
what this is they send me actually sent
me a pocketknife I was like I don't care
what you have in your birch box this
month I am murdering it smack down I'm
gonna throw this back in my bag this
will be a daily carry item for me you
never know when you're just gonna have
to you know apply something or screw
something all right so my last product
is not nearly as epic unfortunately see
it's like I should have gone first
because I can't even follow that like
how do you okay I got a model Co power
lash deluxe sample of their mascara and
this is a less than epic mascara the
brush is nice the brush has very it has
a lot of bristles in it which really
separates the lashes out because there's
so many bristles and volumize lengthen
really nice mascara but the big problem
with this is that the brush is too big
for the opening so what happens is all
the product ends up collecting on the
outside of the tube and if you try to
like like scrape it off or anything then
you end up with clumps if you end up
trying to push it back in you end up
with clumps so you're wasting all of
that product every time you pull the
brush out I love the brush I love the
formula the packaging really is
irritating it makes a big mess and I
don't know whether they just made them
all and they were like oh man that's not
so good and then they just made them
anyway you know what I mean like I feel
like that's kind of what happened is
they couldn't go back because I can't
imagine them not realizing that and you
know product is gonna come out all over
the place but the formal is nice I did
get one of these model Co ones in my
Ipsy bag as well and I like this formula
a lot better than the
that galosh or whatever that one was so
you know but that was my Birchbox you
got anything else that's it I got a
couple little extra sample products yeah
I did I just got I got shoes I got two
of these this is Ursa Major fortifying
face balm this potent lotion
it's a hydrator healer an anti-ager in
one will keep your face looking younger
longer this little package right here is
good for three to four uses my box came
with two of these and I've already used
one of them and so this is the one
that's still intact I don't really
remember there being any kind of scent
to it which some of their other products
I freaking love because they do have
amazing sense to them but this is just
light easy kind of moisturize your face
sort of thing so happy about that might
lead to me purchasing a full-size
product on down the road we'll see what
happens that was it so I gotta say mine
first as far as what was in here because
I'm sad I I'm not sad I he just kicked
my butt this month so let's just do a
little recap of what I got I got the
little Sookie cleanser that I love this
cleanser I do wish it was a little bit
bigger of a sample but I love this stuff
I got the clean up perfume sample I got
the be kind body lotion deluxe sample I
got the dr. lip nipple balm for lips and
I got the mascara power lash mascara so
to me I feel like this is barely worth
ten dollars I do feel like it is I mean
like the lotion and this and this I
guess I think those together will be
worth $10 I mean and even this ain't
really the only thing that I would not
purchase that I feel like is not worth
it as this teeny tiny sample of this it
was just a little irritating but I feel
like it's worth $10 I don't think it's
worth 15 but I mean overall I am happy
with this box is not a bad box it just
okay so to recap I got the Atelier
cologne I got the basics ultimate tough
skin relief I got the dust boom
bay rum smoke enter everything body wash
and then I got the Jack Black pure clean
daily facial cleanser I got the true
utility framework mini and then I got a
couple samples of the Ursa Major face
balm
so I mean come on what do you think your
box is worth like you heard it murdered
it I know you wanna what do you think
you what we would they say that this is
a value of $18 and then this stuff right
here I mean really the Cologne the skin
relief I mean that's like an extra like
10 $15 right there and that's cuz these
are all products that would purchase I
don't there's nothing in here that I'm
not gonna use so I'm super excited about
my box this month which is cool because
if you watch the last couple ones
jennifer has one over mine
as far as satisfaction of the box but
again it's not always about the end
total value something in there has to do
with you know getting products trying
products and being able to say yeah I've
tried that I don't like it I won't buy a
full-size and so there's just there's
some some fun you know just getting the
box and trying out about the experience
of it so anyway thank you so much for
