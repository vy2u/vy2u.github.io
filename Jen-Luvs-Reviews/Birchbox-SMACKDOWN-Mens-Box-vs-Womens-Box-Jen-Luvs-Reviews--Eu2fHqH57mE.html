bunks oh man and we see which one is
better now my box is $10 a month
mine is $20 a month his must be twice as
awesome in order to beat mine that's
true so let's go ahead and get into the
box
all right theme of my box is hit the
books and mine is called fresh paint now
they also included one thing I want to
show you that little extra that you I
think we got to pick but I slept on it
so I didn't get a chance to pick it but
I got some crazy socks these are called
bombas be better and I haven't tried
these yet but they're super soft like
they're very plush and they're gonna be
really nice wintertime socks for those
really really cold days and inside it
says be better which i think is super
cute so excited to wear these as my
little Birchbox extra that they sent
this month you can borrow my new socks
maybe next month you better send me
these socks Birchbox
size 13 I also got a car that says
you're the best thank you for 4 years of
surprise and delight flip this card over
for a chance to score a bonus box full
with amazing samples get your mystery
bonus box free with any $50 order but
they do have some really good stuff in
the first spot Birchbox shop and you
want to see some of the stuff that's in
the birchbark shop you can check out our
video that we made about birchbark shop
yes yes
moving out mood on this is taking too
long okay my first product but bamm-bamm
is the boy shampoo absolute beautifying
shampoo for all hair types and I was
trying a different shampoo I was trying
the dove-like volumizing uh you know
goodness clarifying volumizing shampoo
so I haven't tried this check so I'm
trying to just do one product at the
time so the products don't get all
confused on my head so this is made with
natural Roku Roku ruku oil
it's sulfate free formula hydrates trans
and boost shine
ooh that does not smell very good what
is that this is not my child I don't
know it doesn't smell good to me though
Shampoo right yeah it's a shampoo but
it's like I don't know I'm used to
shampoo is smelling like really good it
doesn't smell that great to make huh and
it looks a little bit thin it's my kind
of scent it's like a fresh clean crisp
scent it's more of a masculine smell
like berries and chocolate and yes I do
you know it's all good
so we'll try it we'll use it we'll try
it I'm gonna steal it okay yours now
I won't that yes my first product is be
kind missus body Lucien Lucien Porter
core whip fresh yeah it's French with
honey and organic chamomile extracts
this stuff smells really good I like it
it's moisturizing I um just got some on
my nose it's a fresh scent if you like
the lemony fresh scents cool
Jen said it smelled like pledge pledge
totally smells like pledge that's
alright with me my tables with it wax it
on down I'm right with that I like
chores I like I like cleaning my house
and like dusting and things like that it
makes me happy inside and so if I can
wear the smell of dusting my house on my
skin boom alright my next product is the
joy air luminizing moisture tint and
this is an innovative favorite sample is
0.17 ounce and you can see here it is
slightly tinted actually you know what
that's more of like a yeah it's like a
light to medium skin tone color it
luminizing moisture tint sunscreen and
it's oil-free feels very nice on the
skin doesn't have a real strong scent
just a little bit of a foundation II
kind of scent but you can see it didn't
cover up my freckles so there isn't a
whole lot of coverage there but I mean
it's a moisturizer it's not really
supposed to so very excited to try this
I do wish it was about twice the size of
this so I could really get some good you
said of this is probably going to be
about maybe 2 uses 2 to 3 uses of the
most so and this is in the shade golden
the other thing is I don't know if
Birchbox lets you tell what color your
skin tone is so this would be a fail for
someone of a different skin tone
maybe they match this to me if they did
they actually did a really good job but
if they gave us everybody not so good of
a job so yeah I'm excited to have this I
just wish the sample size was just a
little bit bigger okay my second product
is white night gentle daily cleansing
what my second product is white night
gentle daily facial cleanser and I did
not have an opportunity to try this this
is a daily facial cleanser this is not
an exfoliator so there's no grain to it
there's no grit um it has just like just
a clean simple kind of scent to it
nothing overpowering so this says a
conscientious cleanser that harnesses
papaya enzymes to exfoliate skin without
drying twice daily massage a quarter
sized amount into a damp face and neck
then rinse thoroughly it might be tea
tree oil that I'm smelling is that tea
tree oil I think that's a tea tree oil
smell fruit oil you got fruit oil what
kind of fruit is crude oil and you got
rosemary and peppermint and lavender
papaya some witch hazel witch hazel
which is a calming ingredient ingredient
for your skin
willow extract cucumber I don't see any
tea tree babe what you're reacting to is
the mixture of the peppermint and the
lavender that's it's just like a yeah it
does have a good kind of light Pleasant
scent alright so then I got the little
birch box pillow pack and the first
thing that I'm pulling out of here is a
perfume that I actually already know it
this is a new one this is the new
perfume by Viva La Juicy and is the gold
couture
fumes lucious wild berries a kiss of
honeysuckle and a luxurious elixir of
golden amber melted caramel and vanilla
which sounds like heaven I do still have
a little bit of perfume on from earlier
when I put on my hello by Harvey prints
from my boxy charm let's put on this
side ooh I could smell that caramel
right away I really smell the vanilla
and the caramel see this is what I'm
talking about boxycharm scent for
September since the hello by Harvey
Prince which is a very springtime scent
this is a perfect fall scent because
you've got like the fruitiness with the
caramel almost like caramel apples
smelling perfume but a little tiny bit
of a floral so it's not so sweet this I
love but I love all of the Viva La Juicy
perfumes honestly everyone that I've
ever smelled I really really liked a lot
and this one definitely has that unique
caramel vanilla scent along with the
floral and the fruit so very excited
about this and will possibly buy a
probably not a full-size but a
rollerball or a 1 ounce or something
like that cuz i don't buy full-size
perfumes because i never go through that
much perfume alright so my next product
is a cologne following that up with
Jen's perfume and this is costume
national by home or homey chilly what my
hobbies your costume national homies dog
the description on this is a crisp
cultured scent with top notes of citrus
and a spicy heart of cinnamon and clove
and this is definitely again like a
seasonal appropriate cologne here it's a
very very spicy very spicy very manly
very like trying to potpourri ish you
know like that the know is on it's like
it almost borderlines on like like I did
I did a smelly number two and I'm
covering it up anything like maybe a
little bit British ruin the scent for
both of us yeah it is kind of like that
because it's like almost like you would
put like a dish of potpourri in the
bathroom and that's what it would smell
like it's got like that strong like
Sinan
like earthy cinnamon kind of scent like
in some guys bathroom so like if I put
this on and walk around the Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond it'll mix up my pheromones and
pull in all the hot soccer moms so that
I like you know shopping some toiletries
and things like that maybe like oh he'll
be like the Pied Piper man just all
around Bed Bath and Beyond you just
pulled that out of here
yeah one thing I did not show you that I
think goes with the shampoo that I'm
gonna be passing along to John as well
as this is the conditioner that way
conditioner that goes with this I found
that in my pillow pack so these will
both be passed to John to my products I
got this little box and it looks like
there's going to be some jewelry in here
which makes me very excited until I open
it and it's a lotion but that's okay
it's alright but it did look like it was
gonna be like something schanazzi and
it's the Liz Earle cleanse and polish
hot cloth cleanser which is really cool
it actually comes with this little cloth
and which i think is awesome and really
fun to use it's almost like like I can
see through it it's like a not mesh but
you can you can clearly see through it
does the ultimate cleansing guide
regular and thorough cleansing won't
show your skin's looks and feel
beautifully in BA it's kind of like a
mini box thing I got before you put this
on your dry skin over your face and your
neck and you work in circular movements
from the center of your face outward
massaging over your eyelids last to
avoid spreading eye makeup all over your
face you rinse the muslin cloth with hot
water and you wring it out and then you
wipe off the cream with it and then you
rinse and repeat using a clean section
for each part of your face so I guess
this is like you put it in quadrant that
sounds very complex and then splash your
face with cool clean water and follow
with the instant boost skin tonic and
your choice of skin repair moisturizer
and then it just says we'll watch this
every two to three uses but I would
imagine you have to if you use it for
every quadrant of your face you would
probably have to you wash it every time
you use it with my makeup eraser like
I'll just wash it in the sink I'll get a
little detergent and I'll just wash it
in the sink real quick so that's you
know something I can do there's just a
couple of drops of detergent and wash it
so
that's very exciting and interesting to
try I've never gotten anything quite
like this in a subscription box so I'm
very excited to get that that's one
thing about birch boxes they really
include a lot of unique different types
of products and this is definitely one
of them so very excited about that okay
friends my next product just a little
weird this is the next product this is a
bonobos castle island floral pocket
square and they're saying that it's
worth 42 dollars on the car that's what
okay anybody who doesn't know it to do
with a pocket square is when you're a
fancy man you have pocket shirts and all
that stuff you do like the little
triangle tuck things so people know that
you know if you sneeze on them that you
can clean it up you know they know
you're polite kind of guy when you have
a pocket square because you're just
prepared for a gentleman's wardrobe
requisite made from a hundred percent
cotton with handsomely versatile print
so this fancy hundred percent cotton
square they're retailing for forty two
dollars that is crazy to me and that
does not make me value this item anymore
I mean yeah it's cool the prints cool
but I don't know about 42 dollars man
does that seem reasonable to y'all or
does that seem kind of ridiculous so
this one was not a win for me it's not a
part of my wardrobe to dress in a way
that I would wear a fashion pocket
square do you see anything that you
could use that for in your real life no
no no I was gonna make I mean I can't
make gang jokes about the Crips yeah if
I ever wanted to be a Crip and grunt
gunslinger you know maybe I could it's
not even big enough to like wrap around
so you can't even like play you know
make-believe like cowboy or anything
right rob a bank it's not even big
enough to play dress-up with give me all
your cash man give me all your cash I'm
a gangbanger a bank robber bank robber
nothing positive can come out of this
yeah it is a little since quite soft
though I mean you could be a gentleman
with
that's not mine Lila can use it as a
blanket to cover her baby dolls oh yes
it's a babydoll blanket I could pretend
like I'm a pirate our meeting
all right gangbanger who buyer
gangbanger robbing a bank
all right not a good life pal no not a
good life path thanks Birchbox sorry all
right it's so much fancy enough for this
box that's what it is no I mean fancier
people when alternative lifestyle item
could they have sent for a guy like me
instead of a pocket square how about a
pocket night that will be rad if this
was even big enough to make a head band
out of that would be cool like like
Rambo yeah it would actually make it
like manly man no it's not big enough on
this to pack like the two podcaster in
the Tupac not with the invisible there
you go invisible back glue and that
could be like man Hail Mary moving
out okay my last product is a pixie
product and this is a shea butter lip
balm is that what it says here as well
yes and this is in ripe raspberry and I
typically and when pixie and pop Beauty
which they're owned by some company came
out I hated every single product that I
ever got from them and I had to eat my
words a few months ago and now I'm
starting to really like some of their
products this is no exception has a very
strange top to it that's very flat on
the top which I thought was a little
weird but it's got some nice
pigmentation it's a nice little stain
there I don't know if you can see that
this would be really nice to keep in my
pocket at work if I want to keep a lip
color on but I don't want to wear like a
lipstick this would be nice to
moisturize my lips um it does have a
really nice moisturizing feel to it I'll
put it on over my lip color so there you
go I mean it feels very moisturizing
it's got a very light fruity scent and
honestly I really like this product I
was surprised I mean every time pixie
comes out with something I'm surprised
even though they've really improved on
their products they're very happy about
that excited to have it this is going in
my pocket OOP alright and my last
product is proving to me again that I'm
just not fancy enough for Birchbox this
month this is a tie bar boom
this is Reata by Adar
it says it's a natty wooden tie bar to
give your humdrum formalwear some
mountain man mystique Donna's timeless
accessory to keep your neck where in
place and your comrades impress so if
you wear a suit and tie every day and
you want to have a little bit of
Mountain Man mystique I would say go
with a flannel and some boots instead of
getting a tie bar not a mountain man
mistake this is Metro comes down to so
this was not a big win for me just
because again my daily wardrobe
I don't wear ties every once in a while
I do have the occasion to wear a tie so
I'll put it away and I'll use it
apparently yeah is that hurt no but it
does it looks like a little barrette
like a little girl's barrette so maybe
once I grow my hair out a little bit
I'll use it you know as a little brat
can I steal it I think that looks cute I
don't know man it's a tie bar okay well
it was a nice try we'll glue a flower to
it you know we'll make it a DIY for that
coming soon
DIY tie bar into flower barette he's
kidding because I know some people like
where was that DIY type our video why
didn't you ever make that you Alya
I've been refreshed every 10 minutes
since you put that video up refresh
refresh you never put a DIY I'm
unsubscribing subscribe I liar I then
you come here and truth and honesty and
you've lied I'm not doing it for reals
y'all alright so in summary I got the
shampoo and conditioner that smells a
little too manly for me so I'm passing
it on me yes win for you I got the jus
air little tiny moisturised tinted
moisturizer sample excited to try that
but wish it was bigger I got the very
very happy to have the Juicy Couture
gold Couture perfume sample where did
this come from
this popped out of nowhere this is the
oil in one melt multi benefit beauty
treatment for all kinds of hairs that
came with that - that's pretty cool
that's a lot of stuff now you know to
have the shampoo the conditioner and
some all-in-one milk you need all-in-one
milk I
no exactly I'll use all one no but you
know we'll work it out John you got
another product all right and then I
also got the Liz Earle the little
cleansing cloth with the cleanser thingy
there and I got the pixie lip tinted lip
balm so I think mine was a pretty good
box this month I think I definitely got
ten dollars where the stuff in here is
it my favorite box of all time no but I
definitely think it was worth ten
dollars to make all right so it's my
turn to do a recap so the products that
I got that I'm excited about is the be
kind body lotion I also got the Billie
jealousy white knight daily or twice
daily as the instructions indicate
facial cleanser and I also got the
costume national cologne I'm always
excited to get cologne even if it's kind
of a weird scent because I like to
switch that up at daily so it's
appropriate to yeah so I'm excited about
those three items the two items that
were a fail for me this month are just
because they don't really fit my my
lifestyle my daily wardrobe I got the
bonobos pocket square and I also got the
Reata
by a dare Thai bar the value is
definitely there if you agree that this
has a retail value of 42 and 20 I don't
know the time-bar dollars yeah so the
value for the box is there in products
but personally not sure if I value these
three products at $20 I feel like this
is comparable to the things that I was
happy with in my box so if you are box
it in ten dollars I feel like you would
have gotten a great box this month so
that means three months in a row I win
then killing me man you know what I'm
not even upset though because I do
really enjoy getting my box every month
and kind of being surprised about what's
in there trying out some different
things so even after I try something out
and I decide that well I'm not that
excited about it I don't like it you
know like that's something that I that I
got new to me and I got to experience so
there's some value there in the
experience of the box that isn't
necessarily like a retail
value I think you know so it's still fun
I'm still gonna buy it
every month you know you guys got me
hooked because I do enjoy receiving it
yes cuz it's our fault that he gets this
you know that y'all and mine it's our
fault together that he gets this but I
like it so thank you awesome well thank
