can't even fit past the K I'm having a
cool no I'm just sayin you got a big
chest hello my friends welcome back to
the Birchbox now and this is what we
compare the women's backs to the men's
box and see which one is better my box
is $10 month my box is $20 a month so
his must be twice as awesome in order to
beat mine and in case you didn't know
birch box is a monthly subscription
service they make a women's and men's
and we compare it every month and this
is my husband John if you've never met
him before
hello he's quite funny so I let him be
in my videos you know every once in a
while when he's not on his own channel
being insane are you ready to what no I
shouldn't go there don't go to that
channel just know you don't want to go
there just say it I'm warning you you
don't want to go there but alright so
anyway let's move on to what's in the
birch boxes that's what you're here for
let's see what's in the barche box
soonish mine is the traditional birch
box box with the same pattern on the
inside and the red paper and the reason
why they have red paper is because the
theme is all about giving and it is it
says it's also about giving back this
month we're partnering with red to raise
money and awareness for the global fight
against AIDS and every time they donate
a dollar every time you share a photo of
it the facts on here with the hashtag
sha are edy so there's all kinds of
stuff in here and it says as little as
40 cents a day to provide life-saving
medication for a person living with HIV
in 2002 1,500 babies were born with HIV
each day today that number is down to
650 and then there's a bunch of other
facts on here just interesting facts so
I'll list them all down in the
description down below in case you want
to know more information about what's on
this box but I think it's a really great
cause and I'm so excited to see that
Birchbox is giving back for November and
my box is kind of a similar theme this
says on a mission and it has a sweet
sailboat on there but basically it talks
about this month how we all gather to
give thanks and then they also are
working with a cup
different companies that are giving to
different charities as well and I think
we'll talk about that as we go on my
first product let me see
going along with the marine theme this
is Clarks botanicals smoothing marine
cream and this is an anti-aging
powerhouse that hydrate smoothes it
exfoliates this is like a daily
moisturizer that you can use all over
your face and do not confuse smoothing
marine cream with soothing marine cream
because I used this after I shaved and I
was a little and you know I get you get
a little bit of irritation down here
sometimes and it specifically says on
the directions never apply this product
to red or peeling skin it had been like
you know an hour or two since I had
shaved or something like that when I
actually applied this but it freaking
stung my neck so bad smells good it does
smell good and for the rest of my face
it did feel good it was a nice hydrating
feeling it wasn't really like dense or
oily or anything it was it was a good
feeling yeah except for when he hit my
neck area after I had shaved I noticed
the full size is 115 dollars though do
you think you'll be purchasing the
full-size this is an expensive product
and I can't say that I've used it enough
to make a determination whether I really
like it that much or not but it's you
know I'll beginning just five hundred
and fifteen dollars for a face cream it
does say that it does help the brand
support the Christopher Reeve Foundation
oh that's nice so that's a plus right so
let's go on to my first product and I
have not had a chance to try many of
these things in here yet because I just
got my Birchbox right before filming
this so sad about that but I can tell
you a little bit about the way it smells
way it feels things like that just from
first impressions so this is the Amika
nourishing masque and it is seat
buckthorn berry and its intention
conditioning and repair for all hair
types I see when I first saw it I was
like it's a mask I'm gonna put it on my
face but I glad I read the rest of it
because it's definitely a hair mask
just as you use it on we use it once a
week leave it on five to ten minutes and
his paraben free which is nice and we'll
go ahead and smell and see if it smells
you know it smells like like it smells a
little florally but nothing real strong
I mean it doesn't seem like any kind of
amazing smell it feels very thick feels
thicker than a conditioner so I'd
imagine that would be a really nice hair
mask but I haven't tried it yet if it
happens to be amazing it'll be in my
fall favorites which are coming up soon
very soon that's all right my second
product is do the right thing do the
right thing that's a movie who isn't
that movie do the right thing you know
that movie I got a google it now
oh is that what was like uh
what's-his-name the skinny guy the
director told Spike Lee do the right
thing
I have Nathan this product I popped it
back in the box just to show you the
presentation that they had in this birch
box this is a foaming cleanser and this
is pretty cool where was this made uh
this was made in Korea this this is the
one that has a little bit of a floral
scent I thought that this product was
really cool because you do you apply a
little bit to your hands and it foams up
really nicely it applies really nice to
your face and it's just like a good
gentle kind of everyday facial cleanser
not exfoliating or anything like that
like it doesn't have any kind of like
grit or grain to it so it's nice and
easy for all types of skin yeah yeah do
the right thing you Spike Lee do the
right thing really is that everything
y'all know do the right thing what you
know is that even made in Spike Lee
produced it it was so I guess you're too
young for it many one no 1989 that was
like 2 to 6
so my next product is a product that
I've gotten before I don't know if I got
it in a birch box or in another
subscription box but this is the dr.
Brandt pores no more vacuum cleaner and
I don't have a problem all right you
didn't what
Wow I know we don't even realize we've
got the exact same product no I didn't
use mine I don't need to clear my pores
like that like I don't have it's a
blackhead extractor and get blackhead so
you're gonna get this but since you both
we both have this it D gunk spores for
fewer blackheads and smoother skin and
since I don't get blackheads he gets it
so what you do is you apply this smooth
even coat on your face and then you
leave it sit for about five or ten
minutes and actually turns like a blue
color on your oh yeah that's weird
it dries too like a little bit of a blue
and then you just wash it off I've only
used it a couple times I do have a
little you know some little trouble
areas in here that I'd like to take care
of and I've always been looking for kind
of like that Holy Grail product and not
sure that I found it yeah okay so next
we got oh this is what I get to talk
about what's on my lips right now this
is a weird sample I was kind of like mm
it's a card and it has three lip samples
in there it has the lip primer which is
here this one is called maraschino
cherry and that's a lip color and then
this is a magnolia color the lip primer
is for preventing wandering or
feathering lip color and locks and the
color helps fill in fine lines makes lip
look fuller so my lips look full I don't
know but I will tell you though that the
primer felt amazing it felt really
really nice it felt like a very
moisturizing lip balm it was very smooth
and almost reminded me of like the
silicone of like a really nice primer
like it just felt very very nice but it
was on my lips you know like it just
felt good like a mixture between like a
face primer and a lip balm very nice and
then the lip color went on really
smoothly it wasn't was more like a satin
finish it wasn't really like I'm a dad
it was more like a satin finish but I
really liked it a lie I like it oh wow
my only complaint about this sample just
Birchbox wise is the fact that now
you're opening these things up you're
dipping your finger and you're getting
bacteria in and it's just I don't like
this kind of sample but as far as the
product I really like it so far it looks
like the full-size is $36 so I don't
know if that is for the all three colors
or
won't color or whatever but I'll put
more information so that you all know in
the description
the next products that I have here I
actually have this is the Chow sampler
pack and this is a gentle duo of a hand
cleanser and an all-over balm this is
called balm made beard scent it says
stroke iswhat Cinelli's beard such broke
beard smell good it does smell really
good that also says on the insert that
you can use it on like your hair like
flyaways and things like that it has a
little bit of like a citrusy kind of
yeah it does it smells citrusy because
citrusy scent smell that what does it
smell like smells like something we got
last month
pledge pledge I love that but it smells
bad I'm losing it smells on there though
put that in and mixes with your firm oh
yeah it definitely smells better on your
actual beard than it does in late I do
like this because it does it you can
kind of apply it here and then it's
close enough here that you can kind of
smell it throughout the the early part
of the day as the scent lasts so it's a
nice product use it a few times do you
feel like it's softened your beard at
all I don't know see I don't grow my
beard out that far like trim it every
few days anyway so for me it's just kind
of like a nice kind of extra self care
product to use in the morning makes me
feel fancy yeah I like it and it smells
good
and then the other product I haven't
used yet because it's like a sanitizer
and says your portable sink but it does
say gym germ Stoppers it's a per body
splash aroma booster aftershave underarm
refresher not just for hand sanitizer
wow it sounds like a like a as seen on
tv ad I'm not sure well I mean it just
is just saying that you can send sighs I
think I may guess you can use sanitizer
for your armpits if you really want to
do don't get bad the body works and get
the little mini and just start reached
and you'd be sanitizing your pits yeah
it is not a nice thing they didn't
appreciate that I'm sure
who caught it you're caught you lucky
you my next product is not so Brady oh
that's I know right not so Brady oh
that's so pretty
when life gives you one too many lemons
and you've misplaced your happy place
joy including bubbles for Bott bath or
shower that's not what joy inducing it
says joy inducing bubbles for bath or
shower that's what it really says I'm
gonna do that again okay 33 three times
no twice this is this is being messing
me up compose myself this is the not
soap radio I'm trying jinx see I'm
wondering how you get the bubbles in
your shower I would imagine they would
just rinse down maybe you put them all
over your body and it bubbles up or
something I don't know but it just says
it's a lemon scented cleanser or
brightening your outlook while you
lather and it's paraben free and you
just massage your damp skin and rinse
away well you can add a dollop to your
back to read the back of this squeeze in
is it to activate squeeze into warm
running water or allow the directly on
the skin take a minute just be you don't
need to compare yourself to anyone else
emerge from the water maybe not a
complete hedonist but a profound sense
of contentedness invest in an eye cream
as you'll definitely see an increase of
laugh lines that's quite a powerful
quite a powerful statement it overtook
me when you're reading it I know
I've almost brought you to tears I could
tell I was but I'd like how it talks
Mason one date tonight let's go use it
now we just want to find our happy place
again so you have two things after one
thing left I have one thing but two
things okay so my next product is bombas
socks and the reason why I said two is
because they gave
a pair of ankle socks and a pair of calf
socks so here is the packaging for the
calf socks and funny because she got
bombas socks and I said urge box sent me
some socks and I don't know you know
this is just a secret again you
manifested the size a fastening socks is
up in this penis
last month he manifested a pocketknife
now he's manifesting socks
we're Birchbox just like let's just send
this man some socks
so the ankle socks or the calf socks are
still packaged because I haven't worn
them yet not as big of a fan of calf
socks but I did rock the ankle socks a
couple times so I don't have the
original packaging on them these are
super comfortable I'm not gonna lie
they're a little ugly though I think I
don't know I I don't think that they're
ugly I mean they're a little crazy you
know but I kind of like it you know you
got a little bit of color kind of
splashing out of your kicks if you're
into that sort of thing okay I like
there's like a little lip here to like
hold it outside of your shoe like
there's like a little puffy right here
so that doesn't slip down because
nothing is worse than having the back of
your sock like slip down in the back of
your shoe and then like half your sock
is on your foot and it's like all
uncomfortable so that's really cool well
never mind having that I really enjoy
wearing these socks at bombas we're big
fans of bees sure they're little but
they have some big ideas like the whole
hive working together to make things
better
we like that in fact we'd like to think
of the world acting as one big hive by
purchasing this little pair by
purchasing this little pair of socks
you've helped pollinate the world as one
pair of socks will be donated to a
person in need so I guess they try to
kind of keep it open for who they're
gonna donate them to yeah maybe they
work with different organizations I'm
gonna look into that was my lifestyle
product my full-size lifestyle product
for the month and you're happy with it
I'm happy with that because I will I
will use these many times and that well
actually have two things left first
thing that the my first thing the next
thing that I have to show you is the
roof Ian nail lacquer and I do really
like this this brand of nail polish I've
only ever gotten
one of these before I think maybe to go
just have one there it's orange but the
one that I do have of this I really
really like I love the opacity of it's
got like a nice shimmer to it and I have
not tried this one yet but it looks nice
and thick when it slides down the inside
of the bottle it looks like it'll
probably be about a two to three coat
polish but most likely if it's anything
like the other roofing and polish that
they have it'll be a two coat polish and
it's just in a nice nude color
well nude for me if you're my skin tone
is that color and it is a roof it's
called roofie and naked ironically
enough so it is you know it's pretty
much matches my skin tone so I guess
I'll probably have like mannequin hands
if I use this this might be nice for
like you know maybe doing a little bit
of white nail art overtop it's some
stamping I'm gonna get a stamp will he
buy me a nail Stamper for Christmas I
want what I saw in Cassie's video and
thrift that she showed how to use the
nail stamp right now I want it really
really bad if you guys tried the nail
stampers yet I want one and then my
final little product was a little extra
and it is the Firecracker ciao Twala
chocolates here I don't how to pronounce
e hua oh wow
has pop rocks in it
pick in your now yeah listen can you
hear the pop rocks hopefully can you
hear the pop rocks I can hear it it's a
little bit spicy food it's spicy I
forgot it's called firecracker I know
but I thought it was just cause of the
ba Baracus
I forgot that and I was like kobol like
kobol powers got like got chili powder
or something in oh yeah sea salt a dash
of Chipotle and popping candy crackling
dark chocolate bite it bite it you know
you want some only 50 calories each it's
free of hydrogenated fats artificial
preservatives colors flavors yeah it
tastes really good but my mouth's on
fire well first I can finish to him okay
so to recap I got the Clarkes botanicals
smoothing marine cream the do the right
thing face to face foam cleanse they're
kind of snap crackle and pop in his ear
the dr. brandt pores no more vacuum
cleaner i got the gel sampler pack and
this is the ciao refresher sanitizer and
the balm made bierce and the balm made
beard scent I just like messing with him
while he's trying to talk and for my
full-size lifestyle products this month
I got two pairs of the bombo's socks you
know one thing I brought to show you is
I did get one of these this says open
for holiday Birchbox and it just has a
bunch of little gift giving suggestions
from the Virtual Box Shop of things that
you can get which I thought was kind of
nice to throw in there I got the I got
the roofing nail lacquer I got the
trough ire cracker
chocolate sample I got the make a lip
primer and two lip samples I got the
hair mask by a mica and the dr. brandt
pores no more vacuum cleaner and then
finally happiness soap in a sample
container from not soap radio joy
inducing a bubble bath / shower gel so
overall I mean I feel like my box with
worth was worth ten dollars I feel like
this is this to me by itself is worth
probably about five five dollars just
because I love the quality of it this
compared to my julep so my juleps are
0.27 this is 0.17 so it is quite a bit
smaller even than a julep
how does it compare to a formula X mini
is it the same size I think it's the
same size the formula X mini yeah it's
about the same size as a formula X mini
so I'm gonna bring that down I'm gonna
say this is worth almost a $4 on this
will say this maybe two dollars will say
this maybe a dollar this isn't worth
anything to me because it's not good for
me I'd give it to him as a gift this is
worth me being a dollar and this is
worth for this so where's that one two
three four five six seven eight nine
dollars so I guess maybe I didn't get
ten dollars where the stuff wow it's
pretty close to ten dollars I don't know
I mean I I feel like I'm to to try out
this stuff I would say it's definitely
worth ten dollars I don't think it's
worth that much more than ten dollars
but I'm really happy to try this I'm
really happy to have this I mean I'm
really happy to try these so I'm excited
about these samples and this makes
anything chocolate makes me happy so
personally for me I feel like I'm happy
with ten dollars worth of stuff do I
think it's worth fifteen dollars
and hello I didn't I didn't sit down and
calculate the value of my box yet which
we will do and replacing below but I'm
happy to have the Marine cream because
I'm a good boy and I'm moisturize daily
I also like the idea of the vacuum
cleaner thing we'll have to see how that
works sanitizer and the beard scent I'm
pretty excited about again the the
foaming cleanser again I'm a good boy
and I clean my face AM and PM and this
is like a really cool product I don't
have anything like this that kind of
foams and has a really nice smell to it
and then both of the socks are awesome
and kind of make it so I definitely feel
like I got the value out of my box we'll
do the calculations and place them below
to show you guys exactly what the values
were so you feel like yours with about
twenty dollars sure you think is worth
thirty so I think right this is not 30
no I don't think we tied I think I think
this might be the first time in a long
time we could like probably agree that
it was a pretty good tie like we got
value out of our boxes but we're not
like blown away the products but I say
we tie this month yeh tying and
mediocrity we're tying in mediocrity
we tied in mediocre boxes that's okay
I'm happy your hand is about us the
video fair suggestion I guess it kind of
does okay well okay finally they're not
mediocre I'm disappointed they're above
average okay so I'm good we don't want
to hurt my Birchbox this feeling just
sitting around here so that is the end
of our Birchbox smackdown and we hope
