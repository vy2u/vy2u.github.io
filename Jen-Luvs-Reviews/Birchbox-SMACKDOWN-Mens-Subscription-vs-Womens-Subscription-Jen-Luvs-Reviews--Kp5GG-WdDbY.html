me feel a little sexual you know don't
say that on my children yes it may color
makes you feel sexual this is your
channel not the color cuz what man
wouldn't want to wear seafoam hello my
friends welcome hello welcome to the
birch box back now and I know this is
running a little late I did go back to
work I'm a teacher so August this a
little bit late so but I figured you
guys would still want to see it because
the Smackdown is one of my favorite
videos to film and we get so many
compliments on it from y'all so I didn't
want to miss it so here we go are you
ready to do this back down this back
down is where we compare a woman's box
and see who wins now mine is $10 month
mine is $20 a month so his must be twice
as awesome in order to be better than
mine so let's see what we got in our
perky boxes
oh the month went flip-flops count is
formalwear is that's a really long title
really that's what it's called
mine just called summer camp that's
that's yeah August you gotta make things
more complicated for women I guess we
like things complicated
oh it says this month's theme is lighten
up would you want to go first cuz I
always seem to go first the first
product that I have is Baxter of
California this is a deodorant boom this
is aluminum free and sensitive skin
formula the flavor is citrus and earth
or Mars now without licking your
underarms and nesting different strokes
for different folks
now this this actually worked out pretty
well for me I like the scent the only
thing that I didn't like was the
application process now I'm not sure if
this is how the full-size is but you
have to you push up the bottom right
it's not like one of those little
tourney things so when you're putting
this on your underarms you actually have
to like negotiate like your push and
pull and rub so that you're getting the
right amount of pressure as too much
smells like nice man deodorant smell
clean and manly citrusy and I believe
you must be fresh yeah that's a lot of
times going on oh that's a lot of sense
going on that all right my first product
is the Amika perk up dry shampoo and I
have a huge fan of dry shampoo my
favorite current favorite dry shampoo is
the batiste
for brunettes and I haven't really found
anything that's even close to that and
let me just see I'm gonna see if there's
a white powder that comes out of this
because sometimes that happens I don't
see any white powder so that is a good
sign it's it's like a little bit of a
floral scent but it's not super
overpoweringly floral it also has a
little bit of a sweet to it which is
kind of my favorite combo since mostly
sweet a little bit of floral that says
it's sea buckthorn berries scented so I
will definitely be using this and I'm
very excited to try it out all right so
the next product that I have here is
Kula environmental repair plus radical
recovery after Sun lotion so you're
supposed to apply it liberally and
frequently after sun exposure perfect
for both face and body and I did use
this it has a pleasant scent to it it's
nice and it feels nice and light on the
skin I did use it after sun exposure
smells like refreshing when you put it
on your face like it's a nice light
clean scent but it's mild it's not
overpowering did you feel like it
soothed your face after sun exposure
sure it was soothing to my face after
sun exposure I can't say that it changed
my life but it was nice I liked the
product and I'll use this up and that'll
be the end of it probably alright the
next thing I have in my box the Laura
Mercier flawless skin tone perfecting
eye gel cream whenever I see something
that says eye gel cream it's like dude
are you a gel or are you a cream can you
like make up your mind like I'm just
totally confused by that so I'm gonna
open it and see what it actually is is
it a gel or is it a cream they're the
anticipation is killing me
look and we'll get down to the bar I
can't even get it open oh here's a
little okay it is a gel cream this is
the weakest hybrid I have ever seen
look at that strength up look at that it
is no joke a gel cream what is that it's
more like a I would say it's more like a
gel though
a little bit here kind of feel it's
definitely a gel little tiny bit cooling
I put way too much on that's way more
than I would use on my eyes feels nice
though little slimy tiny bit slimy but I
put way too much on so I'm very excited
to try this a sample like this for eye
cream is gonna last me for a month and a
half at least I ain't this this is gonna
take you know lasts forever cuz you use
very very little of it so very excited
that especially something from Laura
Mercier because they're a very reputable
brand um so we've we sell she shopped we
shall see how that goes alright so my
next products beard buddy beard oil is
that a serious name hey there buddy
you're holding a genuine beard tested
and approved grooming product sample oil
for your beard yes your beard is thirsty
I just imagine like little mouths on the
ends of your beard hair like your beard
is thirsty and beard buddy beard oil is
just the thing it has been searching for
it's packed with natural ingredients
scents that are tailored for you and
your beard I didn't know I need a beard
oil actually I keep my beard pretty
short I grew out a few days use the oil
for a few days and you can definitely
tell it had it I don't know I'm not
gonna say you can definitely tell it
seemed like it was softening a little
bit kind of like conditioning the one
cool thing even if I don't need it for
the length or the or the roughness of my
beard it does have a nice scent to it
and it works well with some of the other
products that I'm using right now my
next product is the nail Bay natural
organic body radiance lotion and it says
on the card
that it hydrates and firms the skin and
it has olive oil and avocado oil in it
oh that's most nice it smells very
lemony randomly cuz I would have
expected it to me more like avocado
olive oil but it smells nice let's let's
feel how it feels
whoo that feels nice see that the eye
cream felt a little bit slimy because I
use too much now I use an appropriate
amount of
this and it's seeping and super nice
there's a little bit of tackiness to it
but it's an I can tell it's gonna go
away soon
moisturization is nice smell is nice I
can really smell it so if you don't like
strong fragrances this one probably
won't be for you but but yeah smells
nice feels good very happy to have this
and we'll be using this it is a body
lotion so this will probably be a good
two to three uses out of this it is a
one ounce sample which is cool actually
it is a one point zero one fluid ounce
sample that's important to know I don't
know they just had to throw that point
zero one in there we just want it to be
just a tad bit more than one ounce let's
make it one point two zero one yes
I smell lemons juice my lemons yes kind
of smells like dishwasher soap see that
just ruined it for me
that's really sturdy for me now I feel
like it's my like dish soap and he's
totally right I smell like dish soap
okay so every month Birchbox sends one
full-size lifestyle product along with
all the other samples that you get this
month was Terra boxers underwear month
underwear month these are from Grover
these are premium men's boxers in size
large for me made in the US hundred
percent cotton dyed and watch for
softness designed for a comfortable and
casual fit not so much for me these are
exactly the reason why I stopped wearing
boxers it's not the color that disturbs
me because what man wouldn't want to
wear seafoam right right right I mean
all men love seafoam seafoam um when I
put these on they're like they fit like
I feel like I'm a 70s jogger and that
should I should probably be about 50
pounds lighter to enjoy the fit of these
around my legs they were I didn't even
wear them I tried them on and then I
stuffed them right back in the container
from which they came they weren't
comfortable to wear they were just very
snug and they just didn't fit your body
type at all is there any body type you
think that they may fit yes yes old
runner with
legs who doesn't care about the comfort
of his underwear
oh poor underwear company I'm sorry
Grover now I have other products by
Grover that I do enjoy but they're not
there they're like lotions and things
like that it I got the newer Cosmetics
long wear eyeliner and this is a
full-size and it is worth $15 always
happy to get makeup products in my
Birchbox I have not tried this yet but
let me go ahead and swatch alright let's
try this
hmmm let's oh maybe because I have the
lotion on my hand let's try let me wash
my hands and come back hold on okay I
just wash the lotion off my hands and
here's the swatch not so impressed with
this right now it is not super opaque
it's not super black okay the way that
it was going on it's very smooth to go
on but it almost feels plasticky to go
on if that makes sense we'll see I will
try it I will give it a fair shake and I
will it Wilson we'll see how it goes but
I just don't I don't like the
application of it so far there's just
something about it that just doesn't
feel like a good quality eyeliner and
it's really hard to put my finger on it
but it just not I don't know I'm just
not feeling it yet but I will keep you
posted if it's good it will be back if
it's terrible you'll probably never hear
about it again the next product and my
final product that I'm going to show you
today is the Suki exfoliating facial
cleanser the description on this is an
all natural exfoliator with a rich
revitalizing formula and a lemon fresh
aroma wet hands blend I'm sized between
palms to activate massage in the face
and then rinse this stuff is pretty rad
has a nice fresh scent to it I like to
feel it on my skin does its job yes it
has like sugary crystals so it's not
it's not too abrasive it softens up
pretty quickly Birchbox was kind enough
to hit us up and let us know that they
wanted to send us some products so this
is actually one of the products that I
chose out of the birch box shop to get a
full size of and we'll talk about that a
little bit more in the upcoming
you know make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss that my last item was one
that most people were probably happy
with but I personally was not happy with
it because I do own a full-size of it
and that's the bomb stay niak and the
bomb celiac is one of the few products
from the bomb that I don't like I have
not opened this yet I do want to show
you my personal one and I'll show you
why I don't like it so you can see the
difference in the sample size versus the
full size so there is quite a difference
I'll put the sample size down and it's
supposed to be a stain for your lips and
cheeks when I put it on my lips it tends
to stick to any dry patches that I have
and really accentuate them almost like
if you drank like kool-aid or something
and it stains your lips in like all the
wrong places but on the cheeks it does
kind of the opposite so let me show you
see how that's not super pigmented well
I guess it is a little bit pigmented but
then when I rub it in it kind of
disappears now if I let that dry you can
see it's not there and then I do it
again let me get a little bit more
product I do it again and I rub it in
and still it's like not building so is
there anything that you're really
excited about in this box I don't know
man I think it might be a little bit of
a mess this month I mean the one thing
that I am usually excited about is
seeing wet full-size lifestyle product
Birchbox scent so that was a fail right
the next one was you know the after
after Sun lotion you know okay cool
that's a lotion the deodorant school
that has a nice scent to it the Suki
exfoliator cream is cool and the beard
oil was nice to try I would actually
recommend this to dudes with fuller
beards so these are the 3 out of 5 that
you know kind of excited to get in to
test out so that's no not too bad but
you know also not great considering the
lifestyle products was and then as far
as my box I'm very excited to try the
dry shampoo I am very excited about the
Laura Mercier ijo cream I am very
excited about the body radiance lotion
not as excited about the eyeliners
cuz it'll wait the way that it applied
but I'm gonna give it a chance it's a
maybe and then not excited about the
stain II act just because I've already
tried it and I don't care for the
product I mean I think just the laura
mercier eye cream is worth well more
than ten dollars I definitely think I
got ten dollars with a product this
month do you feel like you got twenty
dollars with a product this month no so
I win I got twenty dollars worth of
stuff but I don't like twenty dollars
privilege you didn't get twenty dollars
where the value for you personally yes
that's true
so there we go so I win this month for
the second month in a row John usually
wins so first box Smackdown you did
