late video because I just got my April
birch box yesterday and it is now what
may may something may to late May too
late to get the April birch box so John
got his April birch box
Oh a long time ago he died a long time
ago so he opened his and tried his stuff
but mine is brand new I haven't cracked
it open all I did was take it out of the
outside wrapping so you could see this
glorious Brown box so what we decided we
were gonna do for the smackdown 4 april
even though it's a little late is that
we would kind of trade off products now
his cost $20 a month mine cost $10 a
month so you got to keep that in mind
while we're opening the birch boxes so
are you ready to get going on this yes
let's do it okay so let's see it's open
so here's opens differently than mine
mine is like that - here's mine mine
says rainy days what is your say mine
says spring fever mmm-hmm and his is all
like guy sound and like appealing the
guys and mine's all chicks down and like
a feelin two chicks on the back is all
the products and it tells you about the
products and what the full size costs
and I got this little thing it says 52
bright ideas for a rainy day and I got
tip number 42 which is unroll your yoga
mat and cue up an at-home routine with
one of Tara styles of videos and I've
actually seen her videos before they're
actually really good so that's kind of
cool and that little thing about
Birchbox aces and thanks to you guys I
am a birch box because I've given a
bunch of referrals which means that I
just get free shipping as far as I know
if they make it sound all VIP but I
haven't seen anything except for that I
get free shipping but that's really nice
on the top when I open it up there is a
postcard looking thing and I'm like oh
okay and there's a little sample of
cologne in there it's called L'Atelier
cologne when I put it on here blue it
smells like I spilled a gin and tonic on
me which I actually like the scent of it
I've been kind of mixing it with some of
my others
since there is the postcard and it also
has the sample right here in the
postcard actually with the lemons and
all that stuff is pretty a pretty good
visual indicator of what the stuff
smells like so that's pretty neat okay
so my first product that I am seeing
ahahaha
Camille Beckman now I seriously don't
really I just wish she wasn't having his
bone so not quite having your bone so
loud dog oh my gosh okay so anyway
Camille Beckman I actually got in touch
all Camille Beckman the the the person
who's the rep for Camille Beckman got in
touch with me and sent me some products
of theirs and this is actually my
favorite scent of theirs we've got to
stop at I can't oh my god okay so this
is actually my favorite scent of theirs
that they sent me they sent me like five
of their scents oh it smells so good
it's like a perfect combination of
fruity and floral oh yeah and it's very
buttery smelling it's just a very creamy
buttery smelling one smell that smells
amazing it won't hurt you
so yeah I'm just a big fan of the people
over at Camille Beckman and of their
products one thing I love about their
stuff is it seeps into your skin very
quickly and really moisturizes you don't
have that oily greasy feeling on your
skin so really really excited and happy
to have that so the next one that I have
that I see I pull out and it is English
laundry it's a three-in-one shampoo
conditioner and Body Wash and this stuff
smells really good I've been using it
I'm almost out of it and I put it on my
face and I let it sit and it's got like
a minty kind of smell to it and a
feeling to it and it it's a shampoo and
body wash as I put it on your face
well it's shampoo conditioner and Body
Wash you're not supposed to put it on
your face I know it I put it on my face
and it feels really good it's like it's
like vicks vapor rub it's like burning
it's probably not good it's a guy thing
you know niggas do
feels right natural they need extreme
you know feeling sensations so this does
the trick I will actually be purchasing
a full-size of this most likely because
I do like it that much
ulis okay I got next the ke IMS Keim's
haircare and it's peppermint and
macadamia clean shine energizing shampoo
with enriched silk protein I don't know
about that I don't see a conditioner in
here but that's okay
it smells like shampoo it doesn't have
this kind of smells like soap not really
a fantastic good smell or anything you
know I'm sure I'm not excited about this
but it maybe it's because I don't know
anything about it so if you all know
about this product you can leave me some
comments and let me know because you
guys usually know more than I do
so we'll see about that alright you
ready for my next product yes let's do
it
so I open up the little tissue paper
it's got a couple products in here we're
doing doing one by one yes time the next
one is Vasanti brighten up enzymatic
face rejuvenator and you know what's
really funny about that is I actually
got that in a birch box and I complained
because I can even see through here that
it's only got this much product in there
in this big tube and I was like what is
that without why can't you fill up the
tube I seriously I've been using this
almost every day since I got it a few
months ago and I still have a lot of
product left and I love this product so
he's been using mine and we will share
that one when it's done I'm sure yeah
mine's done they haven't cracked this
one open yet so we've been using hers
yeah do you like it I don't know it's an
explained here put it on my face and it
feels like sand yeah but it's very fine
fine fine green sand so it's not real
scratch like it feels nice yeah it
doesn't feel like super goody alright
next I have a little pouch pouch why
wait for a rainy day
shot for Mother's Day gifts it's a
little late for that I got the Anastacio
Beverly Hills clear brow gel this
packaging feels cheaper than the woman I
have I have this so this is the one that
I have it's definitely heavier it's
definitely a better packaging this one
is very light yeah it's the same ounces
it's just cheaper packaging it's
actually dented packaging I don't know
but I mean I do like this one's mine
you can open that one I do like mine
it's got a very strong alcohol smell I
feel like it makes my eyebrows pretty
crispy it's it's fine so you know why I
know some of you would really love to
try the anasazi eyebrow gel so I'm gonna
go ahead and give this away so if you
are interested in the Anastasio brow gel
I will give you this one and just put a
comment down below tell me you're
interested in it within the first 24
hours of the upload of this video I will
pick a winner and then I will ship this
out to you at some point I'm not very
good at sending things quickly so you
will get it but I just don't know when
my next product is stumbling stache face
moisturizer and beard conditioner you
use that I've been I've been using it a
little bit I haven't really noticed too
much of a difference I have pretty
coarse hair on my face so maybe I just
need to use this like three times a day
or something to make a difference but
I've it's not a bad product it's just
not a great product yeah I just I don't
know if it's for me or not okay do you
have two things laughter one thing
laughter I have one thing okay I have
two things left I have a nail polish by
color club and this is a beautiful mint
green and I'm just gonna quickly just do
drip test real quick so this one looks
like a two coat polish probably one
probably two coats it's a gorgeous
gorgeous color I will definitely be
using this I've had hit or miss with
color club bomb but anxious to try
another one of these my turn
your train okay so the last item is
actually two items it's the same thing
these are Vivar tea the variety live
vividly no show live for socks not sure
about these I I like the idea of um I
guess but I open them up and I chose
these are these are like if my
six-year-old has socks like these like
these I think would be better off in the
Birchbox ballerina box so we won't be
wearing those I mean look at this does
it I mean I guess you know those gloves
stretch but I mean they definitely
stretch they stretch but I tried them on
no I couldn't even fit him like halfway
on my feet it was ridiculous so so that
was you know we'll give him Delilah
yeah so the six year old they're
fabulous we're giving
I left what the Birchbox bonus and it is
quite crumbled but I do enjoy these this
is the maple pumpkin seeds with sea salt
calling bar and I do really like these
kind bars are yummy so happy to have
that even though mine is totally and
completely broken inside but that's ok
it still tastes the same it gets broken
when you eat it anyway so so in summary
for perch box for me I got the where did
it go boss it
I got Nica meal Beckmann lotion I do
wish it was a bigger size because I do
love it but this is a fantastic lotion I
got the team's haircare shampoo minty
minty and macadamia e I got the AH
Stassi ah
brow gel I got the color club nail
polish and I got the kind bar so added
these products the only ones I'm excited
about really and truly are these two so
is that worth ten dollars
I don't know close to it close to it but
I don't know um what about you baby
so out of the products that I got I got
Atelier clone
I got English laundry three and one I
got a stubble in the stache face
moisturizer and conditioner or yes and
beard conditioner I also got Musante
brighten up face rejuvenator then I got
ballerina slippers so I'm not excited
about those the brighten up makes me
feel like I'm pampering myself that's
cool same thing with the moisturizer the
Cologne is rad and the English laundry
