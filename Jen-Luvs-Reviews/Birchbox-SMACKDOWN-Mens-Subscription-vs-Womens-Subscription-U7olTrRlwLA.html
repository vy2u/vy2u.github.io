Smackdown this is when we compare the
women's box to to the men's bow and we
see who wins now my subscription is $10
a month and mine is 20 so his has to be
twice as awesome in order for him to win
let's go ahead and see what we got it
looks like they're both sponsored by
magazines this month mine is sponsored
by women's health mine is sponsored by
detail and I've never read women's
health I don't think have you ever read
details I maybe flip through it but I've
never I've never purchased it hmm well
maybe we should reconsider no maybe this
is a really cool little print on here
it's got dumbbells and like yoga pants
and exercise balls and jump ropes and
all kinds of cool stuff on there Brown
okay card mine is called power up mine
is called best-in-show my if you were a
video game character go with us here
you'd have access to all sorts of
magical boosters since you're just a
regular awesome human being you've got
us we've teamed up with Women's Health
magazine to power up your month starting
with your Beauty surprised you didn't
hooked up I know they're turning me into
a video game character with boosters
mm-hmm mmm vegetables on there which
makes it really convincing all right so
my first product is the whish shave
cream if you're used to shaving being a
dry affair then you're in for an
incredibly luscious surprise I'm excited
about shave cream because I've been
using soap lately and it's been working
just fine for me
would that smells good it smells like a
drink but I'd like to switch back to
shaving cream I think that would be a
good thing
shea butter pact shave cream in a
pick-me-up grapefruit scents so super
excited about that the first item that I
notice when I open up my box these
contents are in a soap dish soap dish it
gave you what it's so beautiful
okay so the first item that I'm pulling
out is Clinique for men brown sector own
SPF 21 moisturizer yes sunny day staple
heavy weight hydration UVA UVB
protection I have a face moisturizer
that I've been using that has a nice
scent I've used this a couple of times
because he opens his box I don't know -
so I've used some of this stuff there's
no like Pleasant awesome scent to it so
is there's no like super incentive to
use it for me so but it is you know it
is nice from the harsh Sun nice and this
is perfect season for it so for sure
alright my next one is a balance meet
extra care wonder eye cream choose
brightens and lifts for all skin types
okay but the thing about eye creams is
you don't you only need the tiniest
little bit so having a small sample of
this is not a big deal at all and it's
99% natural which is amazing I've been
trying to move more toward natural
beauty products I'm definitely not
all-natural by any means let me say
there's anything cool in here about this
balance means conquers wrinkles and dark
circles at the first signs of aging nice
so super super excited about that this
is a good Birchbox so far I'm excited
you're excited yes this is a good one
I'm not as I'm not as excited about me
oh I think I might win but I do have I
do have an interesting story about the
next product yeah interesting story I do
this is Ursa Major fantastic face wash
haha and so I opened my boxes early and
I try to use them so it's a concentrated
foaming gel and it dissolves exfoliates
and clears blocked pores okay it says
use am/pm and post-exercise right so I
throw it in my gym bag and you can
imagine the looks that I'm getting at
the water fountain after my workout
alright so I fill up my protein I'm like
chugging my shake and I get all this
stuff on my face you know there's a line
building there's chicks thankfully right
they get it what says post exercise
maybe supposed to use it at the water
fountain so it says leave on for 30 and
30 to 60 seconds so I'm like
people piling up some stand in there
probably and you know there's two
there's two water fountains there so I
was like I'm only using one but you know
people they don't use if you're using
one of them it's like it's like they
feel like they can't use the one next to
it so I'm all foamed up I'm trying to
wave people through I got it done and I
like the way it feels on my face I feel
like I feel like the people that were
looking at me weird were just like upset
you don't really do that did you they
forgot their skincare face treatment you
did that post exercise it's serious man
you got a shake if you're gonna dedicate
going to the gym then you should do the
supplements and the things okay they
come along with it right are you gonna
do it again wash your face and the water
fountain I do it and then in the locker
rooms next time this is the real
chemistry luminous three-minute peel for
instantly smoother brighter softer skin
if this actually makes my skin peel this
will be a no but if it's just like a
mask and it peels off some dead skins
I'm cool with it and I might actually
try it I don't like like the paper mask
that you stick on your face but I do try
and enjoy these sometimes acid free peel
gently exfoliates for instantly softer
smoother brighter skin so I will be
using this because it's not like making
my skin flake off like the feet stuff I
got in my Mimi box I'm so scared of that
I might have his zombie feet if you
didn't see my Mimi box opening I'll put
it down below where we talked about the
zombie cream for my feet but wait it
feels like an exfoliator it's got a
little chunkies on it it's got little
chunky it doesn't have any scent to it
the packaging is cool yay moving on okay
so the next thing that I pull out of my
box is a soap dish it's a symptom but it
has like it has a print saying on it
I pledge to lead by example to be true
and brave so little morning affirmation
while you're by your foam in your face
you're gonna be true and brave at the
tattoo shop I pledge to lead by example
to be true and brave
everybody needs affirmations in the
morning you know this could be like the
push that somebody needs to like a
better person that day
definitely but who doesn't have their
doesn't have a simple dish if they have
the need for one do you need a soap dish
I don't know I don't know what I'm gonna
do with this I don't know what you're
gonna do with either we have the smaller
battle room
maybe you can like our bathroom it's
like a closet we have one bathroom in
our house and that's like a closet
there's no room for a soap dish on our
sink it's like the smallest little sink
you can possibly get
we'll find out we'll find a use for it
or we'll find somebody who needs
positive morning affirmations under
there so there eco
so next I'm adjusting adjust adjust away
all right so next I got my Birchbox
pillow pack they usually have some
really cool stuff in it so let's see
what this is
whoa that's some shiny shiny stuff all
right this is a little lacquer
a lacquer and company lip Lube and it's
a neon purple I hope this isn't super
pigmented because there's no way if this
is so it's not super pigmented it's not
bad enough and it smells it smells minty
it reminds me of the bareMinerals
products there the mint enos smell so
I'll try that it is a little bit right
say whoops it's a lip blue whatever a
lip Lube is lip noobish ever need
lubrication give it high-gloss
semi-sheer lip color that's perfect for
summer bonus it smells minty fresh that
is a nice bonus I like that my Birchbox
is rocking this month I think I'm gonna
mean true to every other Birchbox that
I've gotten I got another killer sample
this one is capsule Parfums Poulos do
full size $38 small-batch cologne that
blends citrus lily and Vivian for a bold
and bright aroma look at is better
same thing I looked it up I had to look
it up after the last boxes ever yes a
bit of herb you didn't like the last
thing that's often last no I'm saying
I'm not impressed they used the same
adjectives whatever modifier whatever
that word is the same ingredient two
months in a row you think I am someone
who likes a network Bennifer that's what
they think I don't know what that smells
like though I never do you smell it yeah
yeah I'm wearing it right now well you
know
it's okay I don't smell it here oh
that's okay yeah I agree
I like the musky the musky men
fragrances and that one does it smell
super musky I'm super paper cut
yeah I'm terrible no I just want to eat
salt this one's good but it's um it's
forgettable yeah definitely forgettable
I agree with that
okay my last product in here is a little
packet and it is a hundred percent pure
honey cream wash ginger ade makes me
think I would need to drink it but then
it says wash so that is the beauty extra
and it's a rich foaming cleanser with
aloe to hydrate and green tea to nourish
the skin so it's just a little bonus
extra so I only got four products and
then the little bonus extra but that's
okay because I really like the products
that I got I also got this 12 this
powerup 12 bite-sized challenges little
card thingy that I want to show you
since he's on his last product and it
just says different challenges that you
should do so number one write it down
keep a workout log number two is parked
your hair differently
number three is eat veggies for
breakfast and it just got little
challenges for you to do and then when
you do it on the back there's a little
box and it says I did it and you're
supposed to check it off that's so cute
again with the positive way I can burn
my hair differently right now here we go
and I can put the chick there we go
there we go check one off right now all
right here we go women's health how'd I
do
I was looking yeah it looks what do you
think you're a new person not in my new
person with my new part I'm putting back
