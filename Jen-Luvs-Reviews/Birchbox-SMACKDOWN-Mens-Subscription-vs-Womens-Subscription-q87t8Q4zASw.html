SmackDown we didn't see you in May
because I just got too many videos
there's too much going on and we just
didn't have time to shoot the Smackdown
last month so we saved Mae's Birchbox
for this month and the whole purpose of
the Birchbox Smackdown is to see which
one is better the men's box the men's
box or the women's box and I'm excited
to show you what we got in May and then
I'm excited to open up my June box I
haven't opened it you open your doom box
yet yeah of course he does
I've used like half of this stuff so
well I think it's almost better that way
like I decided to open up my May box and
try some of the stuff out and actually I
lost one of the products but I'll tell
you about it the birch box is ten
dollars a month for me and it's 120 for
you his should be twice as awesome as
mine and if it's not then I win they
came in with yellow paper and it was
called freewheeling my May came in a
green paper and this is like I said I've
already unboxed this and use a lot of
this stuff so and mine is good form see
we'll start off with the food extra and
I got some smartypants gummies and I
didn't eat these and I want to try one
so I didn't I didn't actually open these
and try these this is how they get
adults to take their vitamins used to be
for children and now they've put sugar
frosting on for adults
mmm they actually are quite delicious
and of course they are they're covered
in sugar very good so 30 day supply for
adults is 30 bucks well if we're gonna
start with the extras mine are 32 portal
care these are effervescent breath
treatment and I got four of them
we're gonna honey mint a peppermint a
spearmint and a lemon mint open packet
and pour the contents in your mouth
swish the crystals around and rub them
against your teeth and it when your
tongue and your cheeks swallow and enjoy
sustained fresh breath have you done it
yet I have not used to do it I'm not
gonna do it yes do it do it do it bro I
know what contains like that's okay
don't even say if they're sure
don't even say what they're made of if
there's sugar in them it's just murder
you want me to get your spit Cup beer
mint
I'll get your spit Cup in your cup
he's going on this whole thing ways all
right those work one two three go oh
it's like pop rocks it's like pop rocks
go get the aah ticking here it's Brad
mit pop rocks sweet better rub them
against your teeth nice pop rock for the
spearmint flavor that's really neat how
creative that's genius marketing right
there good job people at 32 my next
product was I think the best product in
this and this was the Cynthia Rowley
eyeliner it is silver so you gotta kind
of get creative with using it it is
really creamy but it's not so creamy
that it's like so soft that you can't
work with it one thing I really like
doing with this is to use like a dark
blue or a dark purple eye shadow on the
lower lash line and then just kind of
lining the waterline with this and it
did stay in my waterline pretty nicely
for about maybe 2 or 3 hours which for
me that's really good for a waterline
especially for such a light color I did
kind of rock it on my lash line a little
bit and that stayed on really nicely so
yeah it was really really happy with
this really like the formula and the
staying power and everything in the
packaging super cute with all the little
dots and everything on they're super
cute so very happy with that product
I opened mine up and the most prominent
item in the box is a large rolled up
white object which appears to be a
t-shirt and it is a very very deep V
this is definitely more for like an
undershirt it's it's pretty athletically
fitting feels really nice and this is a
$38 t-shirt it's wrinkle resistant tea
made from patent pending fabrics for a
slim fit and maximum airflow I wore it
with jeans the one day and it definitely
just feels like it should be an
undershirt I'm not sure that I would pay
38 dollars for this shirt but at least
it does brings brings up some of the
values it must be that patent pending
fabric maybe it's made out of it's
definitely nice shirt but it's snazzy
specialness it's a white t-shirt people
my next product was I will just go into
the Gilcrest and some spa therapy body
lotion that's the one that I lost I'm
gonna insert a picture right between our
heads right there of what that looked
like
and I really liked it before I lost it
it was a really nice little moisturizing
hand lotion it seeped in really nice had
a really nice light smell if I remember
correctly I think I do and the full size
of that's 15 bucks so I did enjoy it
hopefully I'll find it soon sorry about
that
Birchbox failed yeah no Jen failed all
right the next item in my box is choice
rehab London daily scrub up this is made
for men exfoliator that sloths off dead
skin and eliminates excess oilmen it's
an exfoliator do you like it I used it I
used it all it's cool not my favorite
exfoliator right no it's a facial
cleanser no there's no smell it's pretty
pretty uh maybe a tiny bit of a soapy
smell pretty neutral and how was the
grid on it was it real gritty it was
just real fine or what you remember cuz
that does make a difference Birchbox
send you a ton of emails so of them has
some good information on it some of
them's a little repetitive yeah but I
think there was an article about
different kinds of exfoliator Zandile
properties and what's good for different
facial types sure so they talked about
some of the products that they carry and
what different applications that would
be best for this definitely was like
fell in the category of a gentle enough
to be everyday cleanser I think it was
you know good for most skin types pretty
low grit on this there was definitely a
little of exfoliation kind of grit to it
but again it's it's gentle it's more of
a cleanser than a than a scrub not
Miriam scrubby ish my next product is
the Marcel BB cream and this is in
golden glow so that's how that comes out
there and then I mean I guess it's more
of a medium right I'm more like a medium
light skin tone so I can I mean I used
it once
did feel like it was a kind of gave me
that 2-tone neck face thing where I
needed to yet not neck face but no like
not your face has to be you might not
know this because you don't want makeup
but you can't have your face be
different clothing your neck and this
gave me face and neck mismatch eNOS so I
had to tone it down with some lighter
foundation I had to kind of mix it in so
that it matched if I get a little more
self-tanning Sun gotta see then this
will be really nice I thought the
coverage was really nice it was a nice
medium coverage you know for a BB cream
for me that's pretty good
I don't know whether I would buy a full
size of it but I did enjoy it the one
time that I used it and the full size of
it is $27 and by the way if I see you
ladies out in public I will issue you a
neck base combination citation you gotta
make it match it's very apparent so I'm
bringing it down bring it down
landlady's got a blend they know how to
blend my subscribers know how to blend
all right just so you know how to blend
you I know y'all don't have to worry
about this because y'all already blended
I know I know
no not for you guys just the people that
watch other people's videos the next
item that I'm going to show you out of
my box is in this little mesh
jump right here his straw is histor
waters H is TOI our historic
damp up your nose I have here we go wait
we got to do it
hold on I got this I got this alright
this is my official Harry Potter replica
this is this is what's her name I can't
even remember what her name is I haven't
seen a movie in so long this is terrible
I'm not a good Harry Potter fan but the
blonde chick that was it when it was in
Goblet fire and she was the long one and
she's pretty and bad you know that word
I'm not allowed to say in the last book
she's amazing but anyway this is her
wand so here we go so what do we call it
it's his swallows dead pot boom whoa
come on man hey I mean it disappeared
I made it float downward that was
magical it is magical that's because I
have a Harry Potter wreck replica wand
this videos gonna go by
like you feel it his fleur de Parfum
this is the fragrance 1899 Hemingway
inspired Cologne with notes of Bergamo
black pepper and vetiver spritz pulse
points note the subtle but spicy aroma
reminiscent of Papa's prose Papa's prose
Hemingway man Hemingway
oh but how did Hemingway smell I heard
he was like kind of an alcoholic
it smells like alcoholic apparently he
had subtle but spicy aroma okay well
there we go we learned something new
every day
my last products was technically as this
one this floor flood fleur delacour
I got it good this one's named after her
right that Flor de temps that's who the
wine belongs to Florida temps volumizing
shampoo and they also gave us a little
pack I put it in here so that it
wouldn't spill everywhere gave us a
little pack of the conditioner now I
only use this once and there was
definitely nothing magical happening but
I've got a pretty good haircare routine
going on where I feel like my hair is
doing really good with my current system
of shampoo and conditioner the deep
conditioning mask from the balm it kind
of makes my hair amazing and nothing can
really make it better I don't think so I
don't think it really had a fair shot so
yeah I mean I'm not saying it's bad I
just don't know whether it's good or not
it didn't do anything fabulous for me
but I'm just very happy to have it
it is a washing product that I can use
so the next item in my box is plant face
oil and you open this up boom they show
you a few different kinds of oil that
are made for different face types skin
types and then you open it up and it
explains it to you in heel and sweet
almond oil macadamia nut oil grapeseed
oil jojoba oil jojoba oil hmmm sea
buckthorn oil pomegranate seed oil
essential
of rosemarys sweet orange and ginger and
vitamin E me it's got last second there
yep so this one that they sent me is
pronounced Oh as in book and then oh so
it's uh Oh face oil and the type that
they sent me is for normal or
combination skin types all right and
then that's it for me right I'm not
another one yes and they sent me a pack
of bicycle playing cards and these are
action-packed Robo cycle and I think
that these were just kind of like a fun
little thing kind of went with the card
that they sell these are really neat I'm
going to show you real quick all of the
face cards are like cool like robot
looking looking things but the regular
cards are not just regular cards or
regular alright so moving on to the june
box whoo
mine is orange like a tangerine orange
Oh yours is orange too and mine is away
we go when yours is away we go yeah we
get to go away together I'm not so I
haven't even opened the shed so I don't
know what's happening here and I haven't
seen any spoilers my soloing first sure
okay so I got a product Lumiere de head
er sorry French people well yeah it's
it's by n4 it's the same company that
made the shampoo and conditioner and
this is a super comb prep and protect
hair care strengthens and repairs last
summer's too many weekends in Rio hair I
wonder what that looks like probably
pretty Haggard leave-in conditioner with
instant detangling nice happy about that
smells very fruity smells nice has a
nice fruity clean scent really like that
we have Baxter of California facial
scrub another facial scrub they really
love giving you facial scrub like every
month you get a facial scrub they do
they want to keep me exfoliating they
want to keep the moneymaker all situated
I have not used this yet because I was
finishing up the other one but this says
all skin types this says weekly
treatment so I imagine that this is
going to be a little bit more
gritty and our aggressive a little more
aggressive it says effectively tones
exfoliates and promotes cell renewal
improving smoothness and revitalizing
the complexion I'm hoping it doesn't
scrub your face off because I like your
face my next product that I see is by
supa goop super goop play SPF 30
water-resistant everyday sunscreen I
always question when they give a
sunscreen in this little teeny tiny -
it's just a plain sunscreen and I
there's no way I don't think that this
is going to be even one application for
my entire body I mean I guess maybe I
could just use it on my face but then
the rest of my body we have that same
problem is just reversed I got a light
face and I got a tan body and that's
just no good either
yeah I mean I like super goop is a brand
I really like their CC cream a lot so
I'm happy to have it but I'm not excited
okay the next item in my box is Tahitian
waters this is by English laundry this
is the Cologne and a couple boxes ago I
got the English laundry three-in-one
shampoo body scrub and I really liked
that the smell alone it's really nice
the smell on this is really nice too I
enjoy this
I've used this a handful of times and
this says a bright tropical scent that
smacks of coconut palm trees and
late-night drinks in Manila aha and the
full-size of that is seventy bucks which
I'm not so our eyes is 70 to 85 dollars
I'm not surprised let you use it
sparingly right right if I use it for a
long time but then perfumes kind of
colognes and perfumes sometimes they
change their smell over time cool thing
about Birchbox is that I have enough of
these that I will probably never have to
buy a full-size just because I get a
variety of stuff every month oh you mean
with the Cologne switch up your cologne
yeah yeah now I get I get like one in
each box and I like that I've gotten a
new one each time so nice so you can
switch up your Cologne switch it up keep
the ladies guessing you know I'm saying
alright I think this is my Birchbox ex
wait what I thought this was gonna be a
birch box extra but it doesn't say that
it is this is the Jasmine 7 fresh feet
wipes 3 packs of 10 wipes
is ten bucks and their antibacterial
hand and feet wipes I guess for those
those stanky feet when you've been
walking on the beach walking on the
boardwalk and your feet are stanky this
will be good peppermint nice at the end
of a long day though like we rub my feet
with some some feet wipes yeah sure yeah
good luck to me on that one no I'm not
really excited about the feet wipes but
you know I'll use them I've never tried
a foot wipe so it's something new so my
next item is Mount Seppala body lotion
this is a lemongrass scent I've already
cracked it open I use it a little bit on
my hands and it smells like lemon I used
it on my hands my arms time aid lotion
infused with olive and jojoba oil plus a
rich mood boosting scent I'm plotting a
way to steal this I don't like the
packaging though because it's really
hard I can't even imagine how you're
gonna get all I guess you just got to
kind of dig your dirty finger in there
well it's just a sample yeah got some
ads for the benefit they're real push-up
eyeliner got a hot chick on the back
doing some winging action hashtag
benefit experts box so I don't know
about that if y'all tried that product
yet I don't so next I've got my pillow
pack for June 2014 let's see what comes
out of this baby okay so I got a perfume
fall did Schwing
now all this French stuff they're
killing me with the French mmm it smells
like soap smells like dove mixed with
all ours world let's see what the deal
is with this a fresh blend of mandarin
rose and sandalwood that evokes a
carefree summertime vibe I do feel like
I really don't care now I don't about a
damn thing after smelling that good for
you you can have it definitely roses
into what I missed the Mandarin I wish
there was more Mandarin in this cuz then
I probably enjoy it that's a big no-no
for me and what I learned is it cost
five dollars for me to ship one of these
perfumes or else I would ship it to
somebody and give it to some
but it's not worth it to ship for this
teeny-tiny little perfume it was a full
size I'd be willing to do that but not
for this teeny tiny little things all
right my next item is proper so
elderflower with lychee pear and marine
notes
mmm I want to smell it can you open it
French made soap that pears a light
luxurious scent with a hydrating power
of Shea Wow Shea's awesome massage over
skin or live foot to build a rich creamy
lather savour the scent and then rinse
at first I was a little put off because
it just looks like a young it looks like
a soap that you would get in a hotel I
think within the full-size image on the
website you know is more of a standard
it smells like soap it smells nice so my
last product is a revealed 2 palette
sampler I just did a full review of this
palette I will put the link down below
here is the full size and let's see how
the sample size is compare it's a little
less than half of the full size overall
I really like this palette ok the
champagne one in the top left I didn't
like very much it's very very sparkly
the other ones are good I just wasn't a
big fan of the one in the top-left
choice bother to send this to somebody
would anybody want this it's like I
don't know I guess if this is even worth
sending to somebody I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna save this and put
this in my giveaway box and then when I
do another giveaway I'll just throw this
in for somebody whenever because I don't
think this is worth sent in to anybody I
mean it's Sam I mean this whole palette
is twenty dollars I mean this is
probably worth like two bucks they'll
cost me two to fifty to ship it so I'm
just gonna hold onto this instead of
giving it away
I'll give it away eventually just not
today cuz it's just not worth shipping
it my last item is an item that we got
to sort of select this month I got an
email from Birchbox
before they sent the box and they
basically said you can have your choice
of socks or some sort of card carrying
case and they didn't say what it was
specifically but I knew that I didn't
want socks because last time they sent
me socks it was like you know for
ballerinas so I opened this up this is J
fold card carrier and this says it at
retail
for $35 it's a slim down leather wallet
to convey your cards and cash without
any unsightly bulging carry this compact
companion as your everyday wallet or as
an ultra-thin travel alternative so it's
got you know like make it in such a
girly color it's got a pocket on the
back here I don't know but yeah I mean
it just looks like a like a like a plain
thing it's got a it's got a few things
in here this would be really nice for
just a low profile thing to slip in your
pocket
personally I don't wear wallets in my
back pockets bad for your posture and so
something like this is that a slim down
slim down alternative is cool I will
I'll use this well yeah yeah well shot
slip some cards in it slip it in my
pocket yeah why not this is an official
J full product design in New York
precision hoon precision hone Hyun
hello moon hgw n human yeah like
recision hume built to last and then it
says authentic and I'm like oh alright
yeah because of marketing yes something
dude wrote that this is definitely
awesome now so I felt a lot better after
I read the card that came with it and
now I feel like feel really good I hope
you're being sarcastic
you know yeah only a little bit and then
you read up on it you're like a good
writer they hire ya I hope people know
that you know when I pull this out of my
pack oh he's our percent yeah and they
diet neon green yeah sexy real sexy hi
buddy either way I'll use it okay so
yeah the only things I'm really excited
about genuinely are the detangler
leave-in conditioner spray and the
Cynthia Rowley eyeliner that's all I got
I got some cool stuff I mean in my in my
mailbox I got the base layer this is a
cool shirt I got um you know just some
some kind of everyday stuff I like that
they've been sending me a new scent to
try every month that's really cool yeah
the pop rocks are kind of fun and then
in my newest box you know just just okay
nothing like super exciting
but again you know I got another cent in
that one that I really liked the English
laundry Tahitian waters one nice excited
about that and excited to try the weekly
scrub so think he wins just overall I
have less products than you so anytime I
get like something new I get to like
kind of experiment a little bit yeah
because I just have stupid amount of
products from getting all these
subscription boxes for a year and a half
so it's easier for me to be excited
about getting a bunch oh yeah that's a
good point that's a good point well
thank you thank you so much for watching

and June if you did give us a good old
