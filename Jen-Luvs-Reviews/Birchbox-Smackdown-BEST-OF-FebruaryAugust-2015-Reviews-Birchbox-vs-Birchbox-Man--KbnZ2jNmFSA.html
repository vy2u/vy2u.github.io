head now we're has you just got chopped
off no I want to be in the front no I
want to be in the front I feel like I'm
sitting on a different side than I
usually do I think you want to sit on
that side that's you well yeah I mess up
my head a switch I don't like it
well all your stuffs over that dog over
there that's a pain I think it looks
good it was better like this we were
meant to be on these sides
hello my friends welcome back to the
Birchbox now and we have missed you this
is actually the most requested video
I've ever gotten in the history of my
channel Jen when are you bringing back
the Smackdown I'm blaming him it's all
his fault
you know why me because I keep telling
y'all when I film this Matt guy and you
just you know we've been busy yeah we
have him removed removed we're moving my
tattoo studio hmm that's a big move it's
gonna be a nice move a brand-new space
it's gonna be amazing we just had a busy
year yeah I just kind of I don't know
what happened yeah it fell apart yeah it
did so well you know but things have
been good though you've been very busy
you have been in case you haven't
noticed she has a nap now and a sweet
website what's not gonna make up that's
strong that's true so there's been a lot
of like big things going on yes anyway
let's go I'm gonna tell about the
Birchbox smackdown Jen first bucks Jen
it always weirds me out when you call me
Jen he always calls me Jennifer
that's going they call you Jimmy made
you call me Jen but you don't so don't
do that don't fake it for that I'm gonna
make it weird
so for this Smackdown this month since
we have been on Smackdown hiatus for six
months we didn't want to put you through
six times five is thirty different
products for each of us so we figured we
would just pick our top five from the
past six months and that kind of snap
those down and see which who had the
most awesome products in the past six
months five versus five that's what we
do yes but my box is $10 a month and
mine is $20 a month so his must be twice
as awesome in order to beat mine that's
true so you want to go first
I'll go first so first my first one is
das boom everywhere lotion this is a
rugged yet refined blend of hydrating
argan oil healing aloe and purifying
charcoal I like this company because all
of their stuff has like really
interesting sense this is actually sense
of tobacco musk and motor oil is
yeah what were they thinking with that
this says it does my like pipe tobacco
it's so good though I likes it sound
good sound the gross based on the
description but it's like super I just
said it smelled good I said I guess I
like the smell of motor oil on a man you
know it does it for I guess so it revs
her engine it turns her crank
oh stop that's enough well I'm gonna
tell you about my first product my first
product was from my February box and it
is from the brand Marcella and it is the
eye makeup remover by Marcel I'm really
picky about my eye makeup remover it
can't feel greasy and it's got to work
it's got to be awesome and that's pretty
much what this is it's one of those
where it's got the separation between
the oily kind of looking stuff and like
the watery kinds of stuff but it's not
oil it's some kind of mystery fluid that
looks like oil but oh man this stuff was
amazing and it says the gentle makeup
remover for sensitive eyes like if it
gets you know some makeup removers you
get a little drip in your eye it's like
you know but this did not do that at all
it's a fabulous makeup remover I'm
definitely considering getting a full
sized made me super happy and as you can
see it's way gone it's been gone for a
really long time so yes big wheel on
this one it's English laundry pomade I
like English laundry all the stuff that
they have smells really good and this is
a quintessential pomade that pairs a
medium hold with a classic shine I
happen to have saved some of it and I
have it in my hair right now what I like
about it is it smells really good mm-hm
and it gives me a nice hold without
being like gel like all stiff and
crinkly and nasty like that so English
laundry props to you you did it again
yay don't eat this again again boom good
job my next product was from my March
box and it was the Miran s glossy kiss
and when I was looking for a top five
products I realized that there were a
lot of things in my Birchbox --is that
were just kind of good you know but now
like amazing and then I had some things
that I really didn't like a lot so I
kind of was stuck with this one as this
is kind of my least favorite of my top
five I do like it don't get me wrong but
I wouldn't say that this is like amazing
like I would definitely want to go out
and get it also show you a swatch here
it's very very soft it's very
moisturizing it smells up slightly of
vanilla but it's got like a golden shine
to it that is a little bit odd and I
guess it's just the shade this one is in
at number 14 it just says twist I don't
think that's a shade though I think
that's a direction 14 twist it's in
perfect kiss maybe glossy kiss perfect
kiss the full size is $22 for this and I
don't think I would pay $22 for it but I
am I mean I'm enjoying it don't get me
wrong I'm enjoying it but it doesn't
like blow me away so I was a little sad
that this had to be my fifth product but
I really couldn't find anything I liked
better than this that's not a good sign
for me as far as winning the SmackDown
you're so sad about this coming I'm
pretty harder I'm being honest so I mean
it was good it's good it's a good
product but you know not great not
fantastic okay so I'm sad about that I
don't know that's my only one of those
rest are all really good my next product
is from my July box and surprise
surprise it's another English laundry
product now when I went through and did
my top 5 I had a lot of products that I
got that I liked similar products you
know like like almost every month I get
a cologne almost every month I get you
know some kind of body wash or soap or
something like that so my top 5 I kind
of went through and I wanted to pull the
top 5 from kind of like each of those
categories so English laundry pomade
because I usually get something from her
and then this right here Riviere is a
pretty awesome scent that I like to wear
the description of this one is a
classical amid a balls from citrusy top
notes to a base of pepper and oak moss
what's up with these descriptions I
don't know what is up moss no I wouldn't
go to the store and be like hmm
ok moss
that's me today I'd like that can you
put that in my basket but I'm gonna
spray this I feel fancy my next product
is oh I had two from this month another
product from surprise Marcel I have a
double as well Marcel this is a makeup
product from Marcel this is their eye
liner it's a hypo hypo allergenic
perfume free eye liner and this is in a
shade that I am unaware of because it is
not written on here anywhere that I can
see oh yes it is
Blue Lagoon this is an amazing eye liner
now Birchbox
turned me on to the the noir eyeliners I
know noir means black but they have lots
of different shades but their black
eyeliner ironically enough is the only
one that I've ever found before this one
that stayed in my waterline all day long
so let me show you this one just it's
it's gorgeous and I wear it on my lower
lashline especially if I have like a
black on my upper lash line have a
neutral kind of look going on I'll pop
this on my lower lash line just for a
pop of color just to kind of you know
give it a little pizzazz and it looks so
good oh my goodness I love it I love it
and it's got a little bit of a metallic
shine to it which even adds that extra
pizazz and it is a fabulous eyeliner and
I love it so Marcel is a brand new brand
to me that I've learned about from
Birchbox and we'll definitely be
purchasing more stuff from them gee that
sounds real terrific it is terrific
my next products are from the August box
Jack Black double duty face moisturizer
I like Jack Black I've only used their
lip balms before I use this product but
I know that they have a whole range of
products for your face in your body this
is nice
feels good going on this says with blue
algae extract and sea parsley sea
parsley well how about that I know there
was such a thing as sea parsley garnish
in the sea you learn something new every
day
the nice thing about this is it feels
good going on your face it's nice and
lightweight and it has an SPF 20 which
makes it good you know protect your face
from the
beautiful phrase sounds good yeah how
did it how does it feel I want to feel
it feels nice feels good to smell it too
it has a nice smell to it smells like
soap to me oh maybe it just felt good
going on like I was like so how I got
like not a bad soap seeps in very nicely
no I mean I just got some of my nose oh
my yeah
July box I believe July box oh my
goodness oh my goodness I am in love
with this product now I haven't heard
great things about the brand Rusk for
some reason it's just in my head that
Rusk is a brand it doesn't make amazing
things I don't know why it's just in my
head okay I'm totally wrong I'm totally
wrong I any time I ever thought that I
just apologized to Rosco just for my
thoughts in my brain okay this stuff is
amazing this is called the heat shift
restyling creme and this is a medium
hold and what I use this for is
girlfriend I don't wash my hair everyday
I don't I don't wash my hair everyday
that's a watch I don't wash my hair
everyday
I don't watch it everyday I don't wash
it every day I just don't
so I need a style it every day though so
what I do is I style it initially and
then when it's time to style it again I
put this in my hair sometimes like today
I felt like it was enough just to put
this in my hair without actually curling
it again also this is really nice right
out of the shower to put on wet hair so
that in the initial styling just looks
really good I got asked a couple of
weeks ago about what's up and makeup
what I use on my hair to get it to have
that curl and I'm telling you it's this
this is amazing it does give a little
bit more hold but you can totally run
your fingers through it it's not like we
were like you were saying with your
English Laundry hair product it's like
that where you know this doesn't have
like the same like greasy kind of
texture that men's products do like I
can't even feel it but it definitely
gives a hold that's like a completely
unexpected hold and it's amazing I am
definitely running the full size of this
one like there's no question in my mind
a full size will be purchased once this
is gone actually one day I was I was
squirting it I was like oh no my are
already am I already I can't believe it
like I got
really upset and then it was fine my
last product is also from the last box
that I received the August box and it is
contained in this pouch right here Oh
what is it what is it what is it now
I've had this out of the bag and I put
it back in the bag because I wanted to
show it to you this is from first I
thought it said coal tree and that's
what I've been calling it but it's Cola
tree going tree call the Train coal at
REE
it's a nomad backpack a surprisingly
sturdy rucksack built from ripstop nylon
that folds into an easy packable square
Superbus this open you pull this out I'm
so losing the SmackDown boom and then so
the pouch goes inside here and it turns
into a sweet little book bag it's got
two straps on the back so you can wear
it like a book bag and then it also has
pouches on the side here that you can
put you know like drinks and and stuff
like that so it's super lightweight the
reason why I like this is because I
don't like to keep a lot of stuff in my
car but I'm a utility kind of guy I like
to keep you know some things in my car
that makes sense so you keep this like
all in the little pocket bag throw it in
the back you don't even know it's there
but if you need a bag you unpack it and
you got a book bag that you can wear
genius so that's pretty sweet
that's right and we got this um just
last month so I haven't really used it
because I just got it not too long ago
but I had it kind of thrown in my car
just in case because I thought it was
meat pretty spectacle you never know
where you're gonna be like you know
you're like go somewhere and you're like
oh man you know really help to have a
book bag or not a book bag
your rucksack oh it's so super yeah just
pop it out you know yeah so it's pretty
sweet and so this is considered this is
part of the lifestyle category so every
month you know you get like personal
products and you get like a lifestyle
price you guys because his just 2000
so he gets that I don't get those and
happy with your lifestyle stuff there
you know they're pretty good a couple of
things you know like stuff that I would
never purchase like I got like a luggage
tag one month it's like yeah really well
if you're traveling kind of guy you
travel and kind of guy you already have
a luggage time that's a really good
point yes mm-hmm
so my next product actually don't
actually have anymore
I meant to save the package and
apparently I threw it away but what I do
have is pictures of me trying this
product this was these skin Iceland
Hydra cold firming eye gels now what was
that that was an email oh and that would
sound like when you get emails yeah I
was a very happy those sounds cool right
if I had one
somebody sent you a message right away
in being almost like a hotel check-in
yes yes I got these skin Iceland hide
your cool firming eye gels now I am very
skeptical of masks of just skin care
honestly in general because man if ever
anything ever says anti-aging I always
say well it's probably a long-term
effect thing because I never see any
effects like ever so I try on these eye
gels here's a picture I'm putting my
picture up and try on these eye gels and
I'm like okay they're there stick to my
face I mean they're like sticky you
press them on your face and they stick
there and I left him on for the
appropriate amount of time and
everything was fine and I you know did
what I had to do and then I took them
off and that will they were cooling I
forgot to tell you that they were
cooling they felt good on the skin and I
took them off and I looked at my face
and I was like yeah look pretty much the
same yeah that's what I expected alright
cool and it said specifically not to
wash it off so I went to bed I woke up
the next morning I looked in the mirror
and I went oh are you kidding me like my
under eyes were like tight like I was
like sixteen again it was crazy
now of course the effects only lasted
like one day but for that one day my
under eyes looked amazing so this is
definitely something that I wouldn't
want to purchase if I had like a special
event coming up where I want to look
extra fab
or extra youngling you know like when I
go to my your highschool reunion that's
coming out ya know that you can use
regularly yes you can use it regularly
in kind of thought it would get probably
quite expensive the full size is $30 I
don't know how many you get for $30 ok
let's look at the birch box shop app
let's go to the birch box shop at
shopping Birchbox shop app if you don't
have the birch box shop app it's
actually pretty cool you get to see all
of your birch boxes you get to go
shopping if you want you can use the
search bar like I'm doing now so while
she's doing that how have you guys been
in the past six month we haven't talked
I've been good like I said I'm busy
she's searching okay there you go
okay all right here yeah so let me know
how you been and if you got any
questions and I don't know what's in
them like unicorn tears or something I
don't know but eight pairs for $30 back
so yeah that's pretty expensive
I mean skinned Iceland is a pretty big
expensive II kind of brand so again this
would be like a special occasion kind of
thing like this might be something that
I would invest in one time and then just
use them sparingly because there's no
way I'm spending like if I use them
everyday 30 bucks a week
you know ish so you know more but but
they were awesome
I don't now I just gotta find something
I'll take care of these babies
cuz it's okay she's so conscious about
those things I know I hate them they're
little hot dogs I know I miss terrible
hot dogs I mean this is what it is man
everybody has those on their face look I
have them only when you do that though
my mother doesn't even have his battle
wrinkles as I do she 24 years older than
me so now it's time to talk about who
won the SmackDown now I don't think I
want I think you won because you left
all of your products like a lot are
there any of your products that you
would not have you wouldn't purchase you
wouldn't consider purchasing no I mean I
I like all my products I like all of
them enough
if I wasn't swimming in Birchbox
products I would probably buy full-size
the reason why I picked them is because
you know out of the different segments
they're my favorites of the ones that I
got so yes I like all those brands I
like the scent some of the feels yeah
and I got a rucksack thank God I think
pushes him definitely everybody any
question I think that pushes you over
mine has to be twice as awesome as yours
I think here's this twice as awesome as
much the eye gel thing is cool but it's
a one-time-use thing and doesn't last
very long this is cool but the shade is
a little this was epic this was awesome
this is epic and awesome and this is
epic and awesome but I can't I can't
beat you with this even at half the
price I can't beat you with this I don't
think I didn't call any of my things
that big fellow oh that's true smelling
like a tobacco pipe is kind of it that
is kind of epic and that Cologne numbers
really good and the hair jelly stuff I'm
trying to convince him that he went and
you ever met a man that you need to
convince that he won I'll take it take
it just take it and go thank you so much
