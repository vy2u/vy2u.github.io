I can't see anything right like a
gremlin I want to go hide the little
gizmo hi YouTube hi we got to do the
thumbnails okay all right
every time every day need to cut me off
and they leave me amazing I'm right here
okay let's do this hello my friends
welcome back to the Birchbox smackdown
it's been a while since you've seen this
guy on this channel it's been a hot
minute we didn't get to the SmackDown
last month fam got sick so we're doing
double Birchbox smackdown this month yay
double double dose of Awesomeness so
rock it out we are in case you haven't
met this guy this is my husband John and
I invite him in to do the SmackDown with
me because when we do the Smackdown we
are deciding which one is better the
women's box or the men's box my box is
$10 a month my box is $20 a month so his
must be twice as awesome in order to
need mine true story
yes that's true then he goes back and
forth pretty much every month right
mm-hmm
sometimes she gets a good streak going
sometimes I get a good streak going yeah
I'm not sure how our boxes compare this
time because we really haven't talked
about them yeah we have we've had a lot
going on I've been using my products
have you been using my products I've
been enjoying my products well there you
go so we're late on the video but we
have a little bit of review action for
the products that we're gonna be showing
you today so let's get it started let's
get it started in here long it's like 10
years old I'm aging myself as I'd really
like to you that okay all right let's
move on alright so are you started here
am i starting oh you got your box open
side ok swell my theme for the month of
December was decked out like I guess
like deck the halls'
something about Scrooge yada yada yada
with this little December holiday
Birchbox get to guide things so you know
which you got one too so it kind of gave
us some gift ideas for the Birchbox shop
which was pretty genius of Birchbox in
my opinion you know like hey by the way
we're also store and you could buy
presents at our store so this is kind of
that ad for that and my first product
well actually it was multiple products
we got like I've got something in my
nose
alright dry some of my nose look right
there on that side that's a nostril okay
all right I think I did I even just
wrote it down alright so the next thing
I thought was pretty awesome because
what they did was they didn't include
just foil packets of a shampoo
conditioner they also included the reap
umping hair filler super actively
plumping and compacting fluid for all
hair types so if it was just the foil
packs I've probably been like me but
they included this as well which makes
this pretty awesome now I and now with
the not so good I did use the shampoo
and conditioner I didn't see anything
magical happening with my hair so I had
friends on Instagram I've been posting a
pictures of all of my samples on
Instagram as part of my friend Mandy's
sample out challenge feel free to join
us on Instagram hashtag sampled out and
I showed these two samples when I
dropped one I showed these two samples
and I was like they're one-time use
samples on shampoo how in the world am I
supposed to review a one-time use on
shampoo and then once somebody told me
like let me see what her name is
boom Jenni and Hilton is her Instagram
name she was like um well Jen actually
you could ask these questions
does it smell good it's a little weird a
little floral your not a bad smell but
not a great smell to me it's a little
strange for a shampoo you usually
shampoo as a conditioners or a little
sweet these are kind of weird I'm not
gonna smell no it was alright alright
smell is it too slippery or too thick
didn't notice that does it foam a ton
didn't notice that I rinsed out well or
left residue rinsed out well did away my
nope was it hard to brush afterward nope
was the air drying time longer a shorter
seemed about the same and those were
some great questions that she had used
to help guide me in my review of these
so there you go thank you Jenny I
appreciate it you're awesome I'm taking
over the channel or something no she's
just awesome and trying to help me and
and that's what I love about the people
that become my friends on YouTube you
know they help me so as far as the reap
lumping hair filler I didn't really see
any difference with this I didn't see
anything fabulous with it I do use a lot
of like leave-in treatments on my hair
so maybe it's because I'm used to using
really good ones but I didn't notice a
difference with this it didn't do
anything bad but I didn't notice
anything out of the ordinary compared to
what I normally use so not a recommend
not not recommend that makes sense so my
first product was a cure
organics this is a sensitive facial
cleanser and this is a nutrient-rich
face wash harnessing Argan and pumpkin
seed oils to hydrate as it cleans twice
daily massage a quarter-sized amount and
damp face and neck and rinse thoroughly
so being a sensitive facial cleanser
this doesn't really have any kind of
scent to it or anything like that so
nothing awesome there but that's okay
with me it did have a little bit of a
foaming action I have used this a couple
times on my Clarisonic that I got for
Christmas which is awesome somebody
special got that for me Mia tea from the
Birchbox shop actually swear we're not
sponsored and this is vegan sulfate free
cured cruelty free paraben free
nice petroleum free silicone free and
100% biodegradable so this is pretty
cool
nice simple for sensitive skin effective
I like it and that's good enough for me
that's okay so my next product was a
perfume and I really really like this
perfume except for I'm not a big fan of
the price is one of those people
actually it's not that expensive
compared to some perfumes the full-size
is $80 and it's by Katherine
Malandrino and it's style de Paris de
Paris style du petit however you want to
say it but you had to smell this it's
actually smells really nice and I'm
waiting for a few days so I'm gonna go
ahead and spritz a little bit it's got
kind of a little bit of a fruit if I got
that fruity floral that I love all right
let's let it let's I forgot just crushed
the notes you perfume you know if Susy
is good I know it smells good smells
really good yeah it smells very nice
it's extremely feminine but without
being like old lady florally it says
bright fruits and florals for an elegant
vibe and I totally agree with that
if I could find this in a rollerball I
would totally rock it I never spent $80
on liquid but you know if I could find
this in a less expensive price I would
totally totally buy this are you into
your clone now that's my next one on the
joint yeah I guess is they Pamir pet
food we're terrible at cool life a
seductive blend that taps into your
second chakra with firstly with earthly
ylang ylang and patchouli well your
second chakra mine mine is that from the
bottom up or the top down hello man then
we're talking about either third eye or
sacral what I can tell you about this is
that it was perfect for the season so we
got these boxes in December and this is
it's like a it's a very earthly smell
and when I put it on I felt like going
out to the forest and like chopping
lumber
it's it's good stuff which is contrast
to the one that I got in my next box but
this is really good again it's like
earthy kind of like really manly and you
know probably gave me some extra games
in the gym from wearing it yeah I don't
like it
it smells like wood and fire well it's
not something that she would wear why I
don't think I would like it on you me
there do you wear to the gym come on now
with all the other men
I've been wearing in here and they're
like wooden fire you want to go hang out
in pump some iron all I can say is I
like it okay so next is the CRX
microdermabrasion face and body scrub
and it just says that it's loaded with
dead seed millet Manor says it's loaded
with dead sea minerals and it buffs away
dullness to reveal radiant skin now okay
I really wanted to like this and it's
not bad it just I don't really does it
have a smell I remember having to smell
no it doesn't really it doesn't have a
smell but it doesn't have any kind of
exfoliating like it's got an extremely
fine sandy texture but it's so fine when
I put on my face I couldn't even feel it
it's so fine and when I use an
exfoliator I really like for it to have
some kind of substance to it you know
that it's got some kind of grit that I
feel like it's getting that dead skin
off I mean maybe it's because of the
ingredients in it that it's kind of
getting that dead skin off it's just not
a type of exfoliator that I personally
prefer I would imagine this would be
much better on somebody with more
sensitive skin than me I like a like a I
like to feel that scrub when I'm
exfoliating and this just didn't do it
for me again not a bad product it just
as a personal preference kind of thing
that I don't know maybe I'm just
ignorant to the ingredients in it that I
just don't you know understand what it's
doing and I need to feel that scrub or
whatever but wasn't my favorite every
day is no scrub and that's okay I'll use
it and enjoy it while I have it but yeah
everyday doesn't have to be a scrub day
I know but I wanted to feel like it's
doing something something is doing
anything are you ready for my next
product yes all right so my next product
came in this nifty paper package here
this is earnest supplies a week and
exfoliate body bar just a gentle
scrubber that pears crushed lava rock
and coconut shells with hydrating plant
oils used daily preferably in the
morning to fully embrace the
invigorating burst of caffeine so I have
a ton of soap right now and a ton of
facial cleansers and all kinds of stuff
so I did not actually use this yet but I
can tell you from smelling it that I'm
gonna like it you can kind of see
through it here in the light you can't
but I can
it has like little fibers in there so
they
like an exfoliating bar I imagine that
it doesn't have a lot of exfoliating
characteristics but I've heard a lot of
good things about using caffeine scrubs
and things of that nature lately people
doing like the coffee scrub thing and
all that is supposed to be really good
and then bigger reading for your skin so
I'm excited about this though I haven't
got to use it because I have been kind
of testing and trying and using some
other products so but I'm excited to use
it this is something that I I have I've
gotten so many stinking samples of this
this.ub moisturizing skin cream I know
that some people love this product and I
just can't get past the smell and I
forget what people tell me the smell is
in this there's just a really strong
terrible smell that comes out of this
and it does dissipate after a while I
doesn't smell bad forever but I it just
it's not a pleasant product for me to
use so there's you me a giveaway of some
products at the end of all this this is
going to be included in the giveaway you
know I'll talk about all that later but
this is something that I don't I don't I
don't enjoy this product it just heals
and softens rough heals chapped lips I
would never put so my lips it smells too
terrible it's just it's just a
moisturizer basically like a really
intense moisturizer but I don't get past
the smell so I don't like alright so my
next product is from fan and this is the
Nano shiso aged immersion face cream
well done that was like the fifth take
to try to say that mouthful because it's
a lot this is a cruelty free botanical
formula to firm and fortify sensitive
skin while reversing damage and this is
a daily thing this is a nice lightweight
facial cream not unlike some other
facial creams that I've used in the past
it has like a nice just clean fresh kind
of scent to it nothing too crazy and
it's it's you know it's not cheap but
it's not as expensive as some of the
other facial creams and the last thing I
have to show you is my favorite thing
that I got and it's it's a lot of
y'all's favorite thing that I got I I
did it getting ready with me video and
then I
shot a couple videos after that and
everybody's like oh my goodness what do
you have on your lips and it's this this
is my mere Ness and it is a lip Rouge
and this is in Paris and y'all were like
freaking out over this lip product and
that getting ready with me video and the
videos I shot after that Louis so this
is like a pinky purple Lee matte lip
color and it's it's gorgeous it says
it's got tattoo like staying power power
I wouldn't say it's tattoo like but it
definitely stays for a long time and it
does have that velvety matte finish and
it's gorgeous
this is not gonna be an everyday thing
for me but this is going to be beautiful
for evenings for filming things like
that I have been enjoying it and will
continue to enjoy it and I think that
this makes the box for me like I am
super excited about this product okay so
the next product is my full-size
lifestyle product that I look forward to
every month from Birchbox and this month
I looked in my box and I was like you've
got to be kidding me
because this is a stainless steel flask
and the neat thing about it for anybody
who would be interested in something
like this is that it actually has cool
little inscriptions on the actual flask
and I'll open it up here and so there's
different there's different inscriptions
on here and it's just really funny the
inscription that they put on mine
because it says to my health on there
and anybody who knows me or has been
following my vlog channel I will put
that here it's a long time with John
knows that I have recently quit drinking
and it was like for your health for my
hell are you actually yeah and so it was
really interesting for me to get a
flaccid said to my health I was like
dude you've got to be kidding me I'm not
gonna use this um
but it wasn't for CH boxes fall because
you had your settings that way it's true
I actually went on to the Birchbox
website and I was like man like what do
they do for people who don't drink and I
was looking at the settings and you can
actually fill on your profile if you're
a drinker what kind of stuff you like if
you like beer cocktail
things like that so I actually emailed
Birchbox and I said hey I'm just
wondering because we're gonna do a box
opening what should I tell people that
they would have gotten if they didn't
have this selected in their profile and
actually they were kind enough they're
gonna send me a beanie that they sent
some of the other folks that got this
box last month so it's like a cashmere
knit beanie and I was hoping that I
would have it here by now but there was
a little bit of confusion with the
shipping for it it's on its way now but
you either got a flask or cashmere
beanies so I'm excited to see me
not so excited about this but that's not
Birchbox his fault this is actually a
pretty neat gift and I actually saw on
their Instagram some other people who
got it that were like super psyched and
thrilled about it so I think if you've
gotten that a year ago you would have
been happy with it yeah well maybe not
because honestly what are you gonna do
with three ounces of liquor
you know you drink it come on now that's
why I had to quit drinking there's not
enough man so let's just talk about you
know who we think won the Smackdown for
December with these products I was I'm
happy to have them things when I have
them not totally blown away I would say
this one I I'm happy to have again but
not blown away this alright this one I
did not like I don't like this product
at all super happy about the lip product
I mean I can't say enough good things
and really happy about the perfume so I
definitely feel like I got ten dollars
with the products even just from these
two things and this that it's comparing
to the things that I currently use ah I
think that this is a really good one too
so I would say with these things I'm
definitely over well over the ten
dollars and happy with my box do I think
it's worth well over $10 probably not I
would say this is worth $15 if you
include this fifteen eighteen dollars
maybe of stuff sure this sweet beanie
that I have it's coming it should be
here this week plus all these products
which I use and I love this one I
haven't tried but I'm sure I will love
my box has definitely
well worth the $20 that I spent yeah I
you know I personally think because you
enjoy all of your samples and your
lifestyle product I think that you win
for December I do
I think the UV kind of knocks me out
there and the this I didn't really
didn't really care much about I think
that's what knocked me down I think he
went
