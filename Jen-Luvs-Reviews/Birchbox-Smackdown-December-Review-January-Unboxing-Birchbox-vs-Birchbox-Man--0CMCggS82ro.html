Birchbox needs to work on their
flavoring yes of their box as they taste
like cardboard we're going to flavor
systems Birchbox hello my friends oh
wait maybe I can't waiting pardon me
pardon me would you like to start the
video now
hello my friends welcome back to the
Birchbox mech down it is time once again
to review our birch boxes the women's
box versus the men's box so I pay $10 a
month I pay $20 a month so his must be
twice as awesome in order to beat mine
so let's go ahead and review our
December boxes we're also going to show
you what we got in our January boxes so
you know what will be reviewed next
month all right for December I think you
get one more product than I do cuz he
gets a lifestyle product and I don't so
do you want to go ahead and start first
and that way you get your six in and
then I get my five I can go first okay
my first product is Fat Boy tough guy
water wax top boy tough guy what in the
world is that hello but it says tough
guy on it boom
I'll tell you what it is it is a hair
pomade oh thank you that hair pomade
I used it several times I'm wearing it
today it's got like a workable finish to
it so it doesn't like weigh your hair
down and make it all dry hands are a
little bit sticky after using it but it
washes off with water so it goes in
pretty easy washes out of the hair
pretty easily that's good good stuff
when product huh when product my first
product was a baby baby sample of the
Coastal Scents stylize eyeshadow palette
and at these teeny tiny little
eyeshadows and if you know Coastal
Scents Coastal Scents is a very
inexpensive eyeshadow brand so I was
kind of hoping that maybe they might
include bigger samples because the value
of this is really not very good when i
swatched them I was like oh they're a
little bit they're soft but they're
powdery so I was very very not excited
about this but when I tried it actually
was not as terrible as I thought it was
gonna be it was fine I definitely
wouldn't go out of my way to buy this
stylize eyes shadow sampler but I did
enjoy using it and they're very nice
colors they're very usable for many
different skin tones a nice little
highlight for a deep skin tone nice lid
color for deeper skin tones or you can
pop that in the crease
if you're a lighter skin tone this is a
nice blending out color for you know for
like when you've got you know dark line
here and you want to blend out your brow
bone this is very nice for a lighter
skin tone so I mean anybody could use
these colors which is very nice it's
just the quality isn't as good as the
typical Coastal Scents eyeshadows for me
personally I mean they're not bad but
they're not great my next product is
Jack Black industrial-strength hand
healer I've used this many times not
impressed no I mean it's okay it gives
you a nice moisturize feeling I kept
this in my pocket and I use it
continuously I found myself reapplying
it a lot because I would use it and then
my hands will feel dry and I don't work
in like any kind of industrial-strength
environment I work indoors our studio
does tend to be a little dry though so
my and I wear gloves all day so my hands
do need some hand care but this just
wasn't really doing it for me I mean
it's okay I'm not mad at it it didn't
make my hands drier but it didn't like
industrially strength the strong it
didn't heal my hands yeah and for the
price I got a jack black product I would
expect more yeah that's just me
what is the so a full-size one of these
is 15 oh that's not that bad
but I'm not sure how big it is no Jack
Black to me seems like a prestige item
but I guess not
yeah so it's $15 for three ounces of it
this is a point five ounce sample so
it's not like crazy expensive but again
I have I have products that I like
better my next product is the I co
London fat liquid eyeliner I think
everybody got these in their Burch boxes
I really like this as far as the quality
of it I'm just not a big fan of the fat
tip it's just really difficult to get a
fine line it's not what it's meant for
it's meant for a thick line I don't
prefer a thick line and the wear time on
this was very good I didn't find it to
be smudging through the day
I didn't have what are you doing you're
distracting from my review that's what I
do I'm trying to talk here okay so
anyway it's very very black it's very
very nice so if you like a thick line
then you will probably really like this
but if you don't like big and bold
dramatic eyes you might want to pass on
this one and get the skinny one instead
true story
I felt the same way about it I want to
go love it all right my next product is
CW Beggs &amp;amp; Sons moisturizing lotion this
is for aftershave and face care I like
this product it's a nice light
moisturizing lotion
it appears whitish but it goes on like
really clear so you don't get that like
lotion face whenever you're putting on
soaks into the skin and pretty quickly I
like this house the said there's no
scent to it it's hypoallergenic perfume
free paraben free gluten free oil free
and alcohol free yes so you can if you
have a gluten intolerance you can eat it
but you won't get drunk off of it there
we go sorry but it was good for my face
I like that alright moving on we have
the MSC skincare and home lavender and
bergamot body nectar this stuff is very
very strongly scented you're supposed to
use this as body oils that are designed
for use on hair face nails and body it's
the only way that I enjoyed this was
kind of as a cuticle moisturizer I
didn't enjoy this all over my hands I
did not try it on my face because the
scent is insanely insanely scented so I
did not try that I tried it on my hair
once I didn't prefer that either it was
just too scented and I can't get it open
and I broke my nail this product or
third nail totally just broke my nail
totally goodness alright you're trying
too hard
I was trying too hard and now I've
broken a nail thanks
thanks Birchbox the videos over alright
so anyway it is I mean it's nice for use
in very small applications here smell it
smells like something you would put on
poultry well if there's a lot of
lavender in here and it's just really
strong but it does I mean it's
definitely most rising like when I put
it on it feels good I mean it feels like
an oil but this is definitely not
something that I would purchase it's
nice to have a little sample of it for
my cuticles but mmm Sebring dress with
this poultry cuticles it's not that
Poland's on that me it's it's it's it's
lavender scented ok yeah I mean it's
really not terrible you'll clip my nail
off oh my goodness
alright review your next product while I
go clip my nail we can wait thank you
good no I'm good I'm solid nails clipped
we're happy out move on yes my next
product is a fragrance from English
Laundry called arrogant and if you've
seen these reviews before you know that
I have never met an English laundry
product that I don't like and this one
does not disappoint
it's the description on the Birchbox app
says meet your new all-weather scent at
first spray it's fresh and grassy with a
hint of citrus and spice but it mellows
as it moves into a heart of lavender and
coriander settling on a warm base of
sandalwood amber and musk I think it
smells good it does smell good it smells
very manly and amazing and it makes me
want to smell him the back says do not
spray into the eyes so I was a little
disappointed about that alright moving
on to the over I've dry texturizing
spray
I've used about half of this and the
reason why I've used about half of this
is watch this spray ready watch out
watch your eyes you see that holy mole
in a very like an alcoholic aynd of
scent to it it's it works though it's
the it's the dry texturizing spray so it
works on texturizing your hair when your
hair is dry and it definitely will
texturize it makes it a little more
difficult to run brushes through your
hair it gives you that tacky kind of
beachy feeling to your hair it
definitely works it's just this is
that's gonna get used up very very
quickly because of the spray and I've
had products by other brands that come
out like this and the sample size tends
to mimic the full size so I would be I
would be hesitant to buy a full size
unless it was on sale the full size of
this is between 22 and 42 dollars
depending on the size of it and it's
just when it comes out like that it's
just it goes I go through it too fast
and I don't know I don't think it's that
amazing of a product to invest that much
money on something like this but it did
work I will say that it did work it is a
nice product I just wish they would
change the the sprayer on it too much
too much too much too much my last
product is my full-size lifestyle item
and this one I absolutely love this is a
hand crocheted beanie from the company
crochet kids and the description on the
Birchbox app is as cozy as it is
nostalgic this tall fit wool blend
beanie keeps you covered without excess
bulk made in Uganda as part of the
brand's empowerment driven mission every
product carries the signature of a woman
who created it so you open it on the
inside and my product was actually made
by a nice woman named Melania Stella and
it's cool because you can go on to the
website and you can actually see
pictures of the people who made your
garments and this one here the little
tag here says love and there's that o is
a little thing of Africa which yeah so
and this one is super comfy so happy to
have this it's very soft yeah mmm my
last product is by parlor by Jeff's
Chastain as the touchable curl cream I
tried to use this for my waves and I
didn't find it to be particularly
effective for waves but what I do find
it effective for is taming my flyaways
and kind of calming down my hair I did
use it today and it just kind of gives
my hair kind of a calm soft feel it
definitely doesn't have any kind of
crunch to it like the like the
texturizing spray does it's just very
calming and and it's it's it's a nice
product for for the hair
I just didn't find it effective
particularly for my waves I don't have
curly hair so maybe this would work
better on actual curls but but yeah it's
very nice and I like that it's not
crunchy so this was probably one of my
favorite things in the box
yes all right so let's decide who won
this this month are I I don't think that
I had great stuff this month mediocre
eyeshadow pretty good eyeliner pretty
good texturizing spray
yeah little oily stuff and pretty good
lotion I mean if I saw this on a shelf
for 10 bucks I probably wouldn't buy it
to be completely honest I mean maybe the
only thing that would push it over maybe
would be the ico liner but if it was if
it was the skinny one I would definitely
say that this is worth it just because
of this but because it's the fat one
it's like yeah I'm just not real happy
with my December Birchbox unfortunately
well I think I won because pomade is
awesome I always like trying out new
hair products for this little craziness
up here anything they can kind of tame
this but also allow me to keep it kind
of stylized and textured I really like
again this isn't a high value product
but I enjoy trying out new cents these
are nice to have in the arsenal the
moisturizing face lotion was a win not
such a win but not a fail really I mean
it's just kind of is what it is and the
B me from crochet kids really I mean
this makes the box by itself
I love beanies it came at the perfect
time this is the season for beanies in
our area of the world and I love this I
like the colours of it it's pretty
neutral and so yeah I think his box blew
mine away this month Birchbox man killin
it totally rocked totally rocked so are
you ready to show what we got in our
January boxes why not so for this one
we're just gonna kind of show you what
you what's in our boxes so I'm just
gonna go through the whole thing one
thing I want to say is that my box style
totally beats your box style because
this is so stinking cool this is 2016
the year of and then they included a
bunch of stickers so of course I
couldn't just pick one I
added all of these things so I've got
ambition risks creativity that all has
to do with my YouTube channel as you may
know I'm trying to discontinue working
as a teacher to do YouTube full time so
that's what this all kind of has to do
with is the whole risk thing that's a
huge risk for me personally to give up
my career that I've got a master's
degree in to do YouTube full-time is a
huge deal for me
ambition and creativity that's all going
with that but then the most important I
think thing I think is gratitude because
without the the fortunate situations
that we've worked really hard fortunate
to have worked our butts off we haven't
had any great tragedies that have
stopped us from moving forward in the
things that we've worked our butts off
to be able to do so but I am thankful
that we have a healthy family that we
you know are still kind of a great
relationship things like that so I think
this is mostly gonna be the year for
gratitude for me so I was very excited
about that and then I'm just gonna kind
of whip through and show you what I got
in my my box here so then these were the
other ones I thought they did a great
job picking the ones their strength
fearlessness and joy which I think these
can apply to me as well but there's the
ones that I chose one thing I'm really
excited to try I've only tried one thing
in here so far but one thing I'm really
excited to try is the ciate and mini
nail polish in the shade fairy Whisperer
I mean that's just so pretty oh my
goodness and it's very opaque I did
swatch it on a swatch wheel and I don't
know what I did with it but it's really
really pretty I'll go into more detail
about this polish next month but this is
the mini Paint Pot in fairy Whisperer
and I'm just really excited about that
next up is the Evelyn I own a cosmetics
natural organic concealer and I have
used this a little bit and I'm liking it
so far it is more of an oily texture but
I want to use it a little bit more for
the full review then we got the foreo
night cleanser and then I got the Maui
Beauty ever color shadow stick and
copper rose and I have not used this
either yet so I'm gonna swatch that
there it's very
creamy and I'm really excited to try
that out and this is a full-size which
is huge for a birch box which is only
$10 to have this Mally shadow stick is
huge and the ciaté nail polish like
wood and then the last thing in here is
the wish body butter and I haven't tried
this yet either it says it moisturizes
firms and purifies so I'm really excited
about this brush box I think it's gonna
take a lot for him to beat me this month
but I definitely need to try these
products in order to fully decide all
right you want to see what's in my life
okay we open this up my first product in
here is for yo didn't you have a product
there for men this is a daily facial
moisturizing product is the same thing
yeah I got the night cleanser I got the
day moisturizers Georgia for yo hey yo
alright so we got that have not tried
any of these products yet natural tech
energizing shampoo and it has a cool
dragon on it
that's a big sample shampoo for scalp
and fragile thinning hair which I do not
have my next product is Ursa Major
fortifying face balm I think I've tried
this before I feel like you've tried
that with aloe carrot candy and Myrtle
I'm excited to try that maybe I don't
know face bone no I have um face face
primer and stuff like not primer what is
it wash wash it's like toner I have a
toner and I have a couple other products
that I've like from Ursa Major so
excited to check that out and you guys
know I like my hair products
this is Pankhurst London molding cream
so we'll see about this one let me use
it on my hair see how it works and then
my final product which is my full-size
lifestyle product which I can tell you
right now I'm not very excited about but
we'll try this out and see how it goes
what
it's a valet tray and it's an expensive
valet trip you know what valet tray is
that's something that you place on your
on your you put on on your desk or
something like that when you walk
door and you put your keys in it and I
already have a place where I keep my
keys who do you think I am I think it's
cute you can put this on your desk and
