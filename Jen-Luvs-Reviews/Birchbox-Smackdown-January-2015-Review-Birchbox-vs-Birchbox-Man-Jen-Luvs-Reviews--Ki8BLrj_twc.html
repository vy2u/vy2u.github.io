all right so in January Birchbox the
women's one they announced that all
their boxes are going to be different
and they suggested that you keep all of
your boxes for the year and then they're
gonna have some kind of big special
thing if you can take a picture of all
of your Burch boxes so if you do get
birch box keep your box and this month's
box is called less notice and that's
that's the theme for the women's box
your well it's just the same one I guess
I just figure men aren't mine's called
let's do this thing buddy I don't know
why thank makes it more manly it doesn't
say thank it says Bing Bing I so could
you say thank you say thing I say thank
that's something that you say I do let's
do this I'm gonna sign so anyway let's
do this thing I got a check okay I'm not
gonna check that right now I'm like so
all about checking my Instagram right
now I'm like I can't stop I know I can't
stop all right so I went first last time
do you want to go first all right so
this you know this January 2015 so on
the front it talks about you know
resolutions getting in shape you know
blah blah blah and then it also talks
about on Instagram this month Birchbox
is doing like a 31 tips and tricks and
challenges so that's actually been kind
of cool if you're on Instagram check out
the Birchbox Instagram it's pretty nifty
my first product is from clean and it's
a cologne it's a woodsy yet refined
fragrance for the gentleman with a
free-spirited streak I don't know
I don't recall this being woodsy
especially not like the December was I
remember this being like smelling like
kind of clean like like clean fresh
linen oh they're all they're clean stuff
smells really cleans nice and I was like
lemony kind of like I like that one
kind of like citron like Absolut citron
smell like that good point mr. nacho you
want to smell boozy but actually when I
wore this before I didn't feel like I
smelled like vodka has a nice kind of
fresh light clean scent to it hey clean
hey
a little Metro like it's a little like I
know it's good for you I'm just saying
it's true oh but I mean it's not like
super duper uber masculine doesn't have
that hearty woodsy manly set like the
one they sent last month it's more like
light fresh clean citrusy so overall I
like it I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna keep
using it I probably won't buy a
full-size but that is only because I
have tons and tons of samples because I
get like one every month from Birchbox
which is so awesome all right my first
product is the Brio Gio don't despair
repair deep conditioning mask and I
think I got this in a new Beauty test
tube a long time ago and I did not like
it
just because it didn't do anything for
me I don't think it did anything bad I
just didn't like it so this is going to
go into the giveaway as well there is
another product in here that's gonna go
into the giveaway so after I'm done with
the unboxing of everything I'll tell you
about giveaway stuff so basically it's a
hair mask and it's like a deep
conditioning hair mask and you just put
it in for 3 to 5 minutes and you can
leave it in for up to 20 minutes for
more conditioning and it just didn't
work for me so I wasn't excited about
that my next product is Hanz de Fuko
this is a sponge wax which i've never
heard of sponge wax is fiberglass
this is a firm hold versatile hair style
or ideal for messy bedhead and polished
pompadours alike not excited about this
one I like hair products and I like waxy
kind of firm hold stuff but I would not
call this firm hold maybe for a shorter
length hair my hair has gotten quite
long and it takes a firm hold to hold it
up and I've tried this and it just
didn't have what it takes now I did get
another product from the Birchbox shop
this is gel koi Fett and they had
another one from the same company called
balm aid that's what I have in it now
and it's not a firm strong like crunchy
hold but it holds my hair in place and
it does what I wanted to do so that
product is awesome this one not so much
ok so they want something that's a
little more naturally style they might
like it maybe if you have shorter
hair and he wanted to be a little bit
more messy but my hair is very dense and
it has it has a pretty good length to it
right now so we should say height has
height yeah and this is funny say you
look like vanilla ice yeah tell me in
the comments did you look like vanilla
ice when I have my fade a little tighter
on the side I could see it I can see it
but you know not I guess not a bad
product it just depends on your length
and the style you're going for I am Not
sure that this would be suitable for a
pompadour though because that's pretty
serious very serious that's no job I
don't know maybe I just didn't use
enough of it but I felt like I use a
fair amount of it to give it a good shot
yeah so awesome it is what it is alright
my next product is the essential
elements body lotion and it comes in
this cute little jar and it is wake up
rosemary and it does it smells like
rosemary I mean like that's not yeah it
smells like something you put on your
red skin potatoes it does it really does
I mean it if I were to put this on food
if this were a food seasoning I think
that I would enjoy it I remember it
moisturizing pretty nicely it's just the
smell I can't get past the smell I don't
I don't enjoy the smell just it's a
little lemony a little clean which is
nice it's very invigorating and has that
nice and big rating set it seeps in very
nicely but the scent is just a little
weird it's a little bit weird for me so
you've seen that I've used this is the
second time used it if you want this in
your giveaway the person that wins they
can have this too if you don't want it
because I actually touched the product I
completely understand
and I will pass this on to somebody else
that knows also that I've used it twice
so we'll hold off on that again it works
very nicely it's just it's got a funky
citrusy rosemary smells mostly rosemary
yes straight out the garden exactly okay
so my next product is Mount Seppala
charcoal bar soap so you get a nice
little kind of hotel sized bar soap here
this is a botanical bar with purifying
charcoal exfoliating rice Brad
oil and a minty kick and this is why at
the beginning I was like my box smells
so good because this is amazing smelling
like again I haven't used it because I
have a ton of soaps right now but I'm
excited to eventually get to this maybe
even throw it in like a travel bag or
something like that for when we go on
the road again
smells so good it does smell good it
smells very manly but not so manly that
it's like let you smoke your own dry
early fresh mint wait did I just say men
shouldn't smell like they should be on
fire I think I'm right about yeah I
don't know I don't know either
okay but but it does smell really good
it smells very manly it's good stuff all
right so my next product is the dr. jart
BB cream and this is another thing
that's going in the giveaway I was I
forgot how many things in here that I
wasn't a fan I've tried this I tried
this in a Sephora sampler I guess it
wasn't this past Christmas the Christmas
before they had a sampler of a bunch of
different BB creams that I bought and I
did not like this it kind of had a grey
tone for my skin I did I just didn't
like it and this is a Korean BB cream
they're very very famous for being
amazing but I just didn't like to wait
me my skin look this is going into the
giveaway as well my next product is a
food item I'm not sure about getting
food items in the Birchbox not very
excited about that Birchbox
no I'm not I'll eat it because I'm picky
about what I eat and then actually this
there's nothing there's nothing really
bad in here this is toasty mini this is
super bites almond in 12 pack of these
is $34 Wow is an expensive snack yeah
this is organic almonds flax seed white
sesame seeds chia seeds organic
evaporated cane juice and sea salt so
it's very simple it has a little bit of
protein in there amazing um
it does it does not amazing so I'll
probably either give these to Jennifer
she's given to me I'm shaking she can
eat some of these I mean they look good
they're like the bars I'll tell her my
granola bars so maybe one one for you
and one for the kids or something
vote for me here you go thank you
alright I'll show every bit the kids I'm
just really picky about what I eat and I
don't make a whole lot of room in my
diet for snacky kind of stuff so I want
it is what it is but it does look good
I'm not mad about it but I'm not happy
about getting food stuff in my Birchbox
that's just how I vote okay all right
the next two products even though I was
not excited about first three the next
you I am excited about this is the
Sumida juniper Gold contrast eye pencil
and I do have that on today you probably
can't see it but I put it on my upper
lash line and then I topped it with a
black liquid liner and then I put it on
my lower lash line and I really really
like this a lot it's very very creamy
very easy to go on and I did wear this
before and I put it on my lower lash
line and it faded very nicely from my
lower lash line it didn't I wouldn't say
it lasted the whole day I would say it
lasted probably about 4 3 to 4 hours
before it started really fading and then
6 7 hours it was gone but I expect that
on my waterline in my lash line that
doesn't usually last for me what kills
me on an eyeliner is when it starts
oozing down my face and you can see it
like under my eyes that is a no-go this
did work well for me and it's a
beautiful like golden like deep it's
almost got like a little bit of an olive
green tone golden kind of color and I
really really like it it's beautiful and
it's creamy and wonderful and I'm really
happy with it
alright so my last product is my
full-size lifestyle product for the
month and this is actually a few
different products this is the Jason
Mark Premium microfiber towel and shoe
cleaner kit now even though I have a
nice sweater on I'm not a super fancy
man and I don't wear super fancy shoes
that need to be buffed and polished and
all kinds of things like that
so I did not open this yet this is a
shoe cleaner gentle foaming solution
cleans conditions remove dirt sand
stains I wear a lot of like casual shoes
well you you want a tattoo studio like
her tattoo
and I go to the gym everyday and I'm an
active kind of guy I just don't have the
need or the fashion sense some people
might say to wear fancy shoes all the
time so aside from the shoe cleaner and
the polishing brush here this is a
microfiber towel that also goes with it
even if I weren't to use this on shoes
this actually is a pretty versatile
product I have a microfiber towel that I
keep in my car and I used to kind of
like clean off the - you could use it to
like dust in your house and things like
that but I already have one of these so
I'm gonna be a nice guy and I'm gonna go
ahead and start my own little giveaway
so these two products here will go
together the microfiber towel and the
premium shoe cleaner so that will be
separate from the stuff that she's
giving away so say that you want this
specifically and I will go down in the
comments and pick one of y'all randomly
how about that yeah we'll go over all
the giveaway rules at the end right sure
my last product is that's it for you my
last product is the polished choice
resist
c15 super booster and I am super excited
to try this now I am doing the sample
doubt challenge with Mandy so I've been
using a lot of products so I have not
been using this because I've been trying
to use up some of my other samples but I
cannot wait to start using this after I
finish another product you apply it once
or twice daily after cleansing and
toning you should do two to three drops
and you just put it on your face as a
moisturizer and I have something I'm
using right now from the company fresh
and that's almost out and this is when
I'm breaking out next so I cannot wait
to use this polished choice is an
extremely reputable brand for making
things that include ingredients that are
just the most awesome non-harmful
amazing ingredients ever so I am very
excited to try something from polish
choice cannot wait but I have a sample
have to use up first oh this will
definitely be used and loved so that's
all for my Birchbox as far as value what
do you what are you thinking about your
box I'm not that excited about my box
this month value is probably there if
you value the things that came with it
but personal value
I like the soap but this is not this is
not an expensive sample it can't be the
sponge wax I like these kinds of
products but this isn't really doing it
for me so I got the Cologne which is
cool but these don't tend to be super
expensive No
so I've got a dollar personal value is
not so much for me but that's not gonna
go for everybody right so I don't know
you might be excited about this stuff
you know you got the the shoe cleaner
the microfiber towel the the almond
bites and excited the soap the Cologne
and the hair product so technically yes
I'm sure it's $20 worth of stuff but to
you personally you're only digging the
soap and the cologne the soap and the
Cologne is where it's at for me yep
thanks I love to things I don't know
well I think even as you wanted lost I
feel like a loss this is the thing abhi
see I'm feeling two products as well
okay I'm feeling the eyeliner and I'm
feeling the polished choice because
