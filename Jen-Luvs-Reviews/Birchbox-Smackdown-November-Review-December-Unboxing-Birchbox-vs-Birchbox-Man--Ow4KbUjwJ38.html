get someone you gotta monitor its pop
but looking at the monitor stop covering
my Birchbox looking at the monitor what
is this is octopus madness are you guys
going on here
please leave all overcoats Kings and top
hats I make the doorman hello my friends
welcome back to the Birchbox smackdown
it's been quite a while since we've done
a Smackdown we want to continue to do
these regularly I think that would be
wonderful to open jeebies regularly so
we are following the same format that
I'm following with my other subscription
boxes and that we are going to review
the November barch box and we're going
to show you what we got in our December
brush boxes now what you want to do is
subscribe hitting the button which is
over there right there you're gonna hit
the button and then that will subscribe
you so that when we come back in January
we can give you a full review of our
December Burch boxes and show you we got
in January now I get regular Birchbox
and he gets Birchbox man mine costs $10
a month mine cost $20 a month so his
must be twice as awesome in order to
beat mine in as a Shrek and downs yes so
are you ready to show what we got in our
November merch boxes let's do it alright
you will go first let me go first
there's no theme anymore I don't think
I'm not sure if they're doing themes
anymore but they've got a cute little
card and holiday festivities on the
horizon and chill in the air and all of
that stuff
nice maroon colored paper and then
inside we got lots of good things
actually the first thing I got was the
beauty protector protected detangle
leave-in conditioner now this is a very
very nice brand I've never seen it
anywhere else but on Birchbox but this
is a great leaving conditioner I've used
it on my daughter's hair I'm use it on
my hair and it works really really nice
the best thing about beauty protective
products in my opinion is not just the
quality but also the smell the smell is
amazing they all smell the same it's
just very fruity strawberry very kind of
scent they smell really really nice but
if you don't like that scent you know
that you are not going to like anything
from this brand because everything
smells the same but it's a great leaving
conditioner makes my hair nice and
smooth Timms the flyaways all of that
goodness it's just a nice nice nice
product and very thankful to have it so
my turn get your turn David right so
Jennifer got Decker
boxes all year long cuts in the color
boxes I did some of mine came with
decorations a lot of them came Brown of
course when you open it up birch box
always has a carton here
one thing that they stopped doing was
actually listing all the products on the
card they're trying to make you go to
the website and use the app and I get
that I don't like that I like being able
to look right in here and read all the
product descriptions all that good stuff
on here they have something about
Movember which is growing any facial
facial hair and then it also talks about
getting credits for reviewing the
samples on the website so anyway I do
have the Birchbox app up on my phone
because it has nifty little descriptions
and all that good stuff
the first product in my box is dust boom
everywhere lotion and this is Fitness
scent Indy's bay rum smoke and dirt
we've talked about this several times I
think we talked about this in past birch
boxes I have a couple different
varieties of this brand of their lotion
because it's like manly cents it's not
it's not girly very kind of lotion and
stuff like that I was so scared he's
gonna put it on my nose but anyway I dig
these products they have definitely
different different sense than you're
used to seeing happy to have this even
though I have a ton of this stuff now
because the last time I went to the
Birchbox shop in Soho New York City and
picked up a ton of this stuff so alright
my next product is be cuddly micellar
cleansing water and if you have kind of
been in watching youtube videos and
things this micelle work is so low my
solar water is like the new it thing for
cleansing your face because it feels
like water on the face it's really good
for sensitive skin and it removes all of
your makeup and just really does a great
job with cleansing the original one was
Bioderma but we could not get that in
the United States in most places for a
very long time now I think you can get
on beauty lush calm but all of the
company's different companies were like
oh my goodness me people can't get
Bioderma we're gonna make a my solar
water - so caudally i
jumped on that and now has this micellar
cleansing water I do have a Bioderma
thanks to my friend Shannon who sent it
to me from Canada and I feel like this
works just as good as in my solar water
maybe not quite as good maybe like a
touch not as good I've heard the new
Garnier one that you can now go to the
drugstore is just as good as the
Bioderma I can't speak to it but if if
it does if it is as good as the Bioderma
the full-size is $28 which is relatively
inexpensive for a quarterly product cuz
quarterly is very expensive but compared
to what a Garnier would cost you which i
think is about seven dollars this is
probably not going to be worth for just
in my opinion I'm happy you haven't I'm
thankful to have it but it's not a
standout product for me I've gotten
stuff from their brand before
this is DT RT before I've gotten like
facial foaming cleanser from this
company and I really dug it this is a
lotion intended for your face and your
neck and it says that it's specifically
formulated for oily skin but good for
all skin types I dug it I haven't used a
lot of it it says it's oil absorbing
lotion I don't really have a problem
with oils on my face but I did like this
it's a nice light lotion goes on easy
absorbs easy and it doesn't have any
kind of strong scent to it but it just
has like a nice kind of like clean scent
to it so this was a win my next product
was the brow bar brow pencil I don't
know how you actually say this it's a
brow definer it's a B brow bar the brow
bar and I don't know I didn't I can't
make this stuff up it's an extra slim
brow pencil in cinnamon spice and I am
wearing this on my brows today this is
too light but it is very nice it reminds
me of my honest Asya brow brow is in the
texture of it it is not in any way like
it's not creamy which is a really good
thing for brow products because you have
it creamy then a lot of times it'll like
sticking your brows and it just doesn't
go on nicely but this syncs directly
down to the skin it's very nice
unfortunately is too light for me and I
believe in March box there is a place to
type in your hair color and this is just
it's too light but I do like how thin it
is it feels very nice to use and it's a
nice product it's just the wrong shade
for me unfortunately my next product is
parlour by Jeff Chastain moisturizing
and repairing shampoo now I haven't used
this full disclosure it has a very
fruity floral e very fruity scent so I'm
wondering it's not really a dude center
this is really a dude thing honestly I
don't I don't really mind that it's kind
of floral and very scented but I mean if
you don't like that as a dude then I
wouldn't purchase this product now open
up my little pillow pack and I will show
you the next product I got which is the
dr. jart water fuse multi action
skincare makeup this is the baby beauty
balm a broad-spectrum SPF 25 I am
wearing that on my face today it is a
very light coverage foundation II kind
of product it is a BB cream so you get
all those skin benefits and things that
come in BB Creams I really like this and
I've tried a dr. jart BB cream before it
wasn't this one and I found that it had
a grey cast on my face this I did not
feel like it had a great cast I'm
wearing it today and it matches nice
enough it definitely matches nice enough
that I feel like I can get away with it
and I like the way it looks for like
daily wear because I don't like to wear
a big full coverage foundation on the
daily I think it makes me look like I'm
wearing too much makeup so this is the
perfect way for me to have an evening of
my skin tone without looking like I am
wearing a full face of makeup so I am
really enjoying this product and I would
consider buying a full size it's very
very nice this is now the third time
that I've worn it and I still have quite
a bit left so it's a nice size sample is
no it looks tiny it a little bit does
seem to go a pretty long way so it makes
me very happy to have been able to try
this so thanks Birchbox my next product
is from the last company its parlour by
Jeff Chasteen it's the moisturizing and
repairing conditioner now as you can see
I did not open this but I can tell you
right off the bat that I don't
Packaging I mean the nice thing about
the other packaging was that it was in
this nice sweet little travel bottle
there's a fair amount in this so there
is 30 milliliters in the shampoo
packaging in the conditioner packaging
12 milliliters which I guess technically
you would probably need less of the
conditioner and volume wise but I don't
like this packaging man I mean like you
can't take it with you to try and if you
put it in your bathroom to try it's
dangerous man did you know that the
shower is one of the most dangerous
places in the in the in the in the home
in the home
imagine this so you have this package in
your shower and you have this open
package and you accidentally like spill
some on the floor or something the next
thing you know you fall you bump your
head and you're all alone and in pain
and they head and wet on the floor I'm
like this man you can't be steal it
anyway
don't use conditioner why I think that
part of it is that this is a little bit
more eco friendly but what I wish they
would do is have a little cap on the top
just have a little plastic cap and a way
to reseal this like maybe some kind of
little you know plastic tube here with a
little bit little cap so this can be
resealed that would be my suggestion you
can still keep your nice eco-friendly
packaging but give us some way to reseal
it because there's no way you're gonna
use this much conditioner in one use and
unless you were like a caveman and it's
just misusing it like all over it was
dangerous just saying all right my last
product in my November birch box was the
remarkable people liberator orange
that's founded very um American hmm Oh
de Parfum and I really like this sense a
lot it is orange it smells very orange
like orange perfume but one thing I like
about this is it is an Eau de Parfum so
it does last a really long time on the
skin most perfumes last on me or you
know the Eau de Toilette will last on a
maybe an hour and this lasts for me at
least 3 to 4 hours which is big for me
to have a perfume lasts that long and
does smell really nice got a nice fresh
citrusy scent and I'm really enjoying it
it's very orange E with a little bit of
floral it's very very
the nice sense as crisp clean fresh
scent my next product is a scent as well
and this is the Cartier Pasha Edition
noir eau de toilette spray the thing I
like about this one when especially
compared to Jennifer's is this one has a
little spritz R in it so I like that
packaging this has a nice scent to it
this has an update to Cartier's classic
fragrance it features casually cool mint
and citrus the top of sophisticated
warmth of amber and cedar wood and the
UM the actual packaging is cool too like
the full-size packaging looks pretty
sweet I don't or not there's a whole
room smells like that now it smells
really strong so my last product is a
full-size nice though I don't which you
always get in the birch box man which we
don't get which is cool these are
upstate stock fingerless gloves cozy
Lodge crackling logs and your mitts curl
around a hot toddy
that's the wintertime scene in upstate
New York hotties woolen wonders aren't
threaded what does the hot toddies ugly
old lady drink soaked alcoholic tea or
something but anyway these are sweet
I've worn these a few times and actually
fun fact I was in New York not that long
ago and I did take these and award these
and they were super comfortable cuz it
wasn't like freezing freezing mm-hmm
it's perfect for fingerless gloves cool
these are nice they can be like a size
smaller or something like that but these
are one size they're a little bunchy but
it is what it is they're cozy and I did
not wrap them around a hot toddy for any
of you can you imagine this guy walking
into a bar ordering a hot toddy
pardon me barkeep can I have a hot toddy
anyway so let's talk about the one the
Smackdown so overall for me I feel like
the wind in my November box were the dr.
jart BB cream and the leave-in
conditioner the other ones are kind of
me I don't feel like I would pay $10
just for these two products I think if
you add this in I think we would say
this is worth $10 for these three
because the my slow water does work well
so we'll say that it's worth the $10
here unfortunately with this this is the
wrong shade for me or else this would
definitely put it well over the $10 and
this is such a small sample I know this
is only worth like $1 so I feel like
this was like it was an okay birch box
but it's definitely not my favorite
birch box of all time I am thankful to
have been able to try all of these
things I think it's definitely worth a
subscription price me I dig the gloves
these are perfect they were timely the
retail price on these is $29 they're
definitely worth at least 20 to me so I
mean these these cover the price of the
box for me I'm happy with that and then
on top of that I always enjoy getting
new fragrances to try because I don't
like committing to full sizes this is a
super win but I already have a ton of
this so you know kind of here's what it
is there and then we already talked
about the shampoo and the conditioner
and then the the face lotion is cool too
so all in all I feel like I got value
out of my box and happy that I get it
and also just the you know the fact that
you know getting new products trying new
products all that stuff I don't know who
won this month so long as we both got
some kind of man but we've almost also
got some things that were really excited
about so I'm you know we don't often tie
so I mean we could just really cool I
think I'm gonna call it a tie on this
one damn silver December we're just
gonna kind of rock through the December
box and give some very very short
descriptions of it we'll give you full
reviews on all these products next month
I like it when I get back with designs
on them come on alright so my December
box is kind of cool because you open it
up and everything is kind of similar
colors it has a nice visual appeal to
the inside of it which is pretty sweet
I'm the product that I'm going to start
with that I got is the tough guy water
wax so this is like a pomade but not too
much of a smell to it I have used this
dig this and then my first product that
I got in my December box was the orb
I
believes how you pronounce this dry
texturizing spray and my idiot self when
I first got this I was on like third day
hair like nastiness and I was like oh
it's a dry shampoo so what am i idiots
off to I sprayed it all in my oily hair
and it texturized my oily hair and it
made it look even more oily so I know
this works really well it really made my
oily air and it's like turn into strips
of oil it was horrible it was that I
have used this other than that but it
seems like a really nice product so far
just don't ever spray this in your oily
hair bad idea
my next product is Jack Black
industrial-strength hand humor I like
Jack Black products if you watched this
channel for a while and seeing videos
with me on here you know that I like
Jack Black products specifically the lip
balms but um the hand healer I'm
interested to try out this is a good
month try it out so I'll give you guys
more info on this next month okay and
then my next product is also by parlour
by Jeff Chastain and this is the
touchable curl cream and it's a silky
light hold for curly - wavy hair and my
natural hair is quite wavy and I have
not used this yet so I'm looking forward
to using it so my next product is CW
bags and Suns moisturizing lotion this
is aftershave and face care so that's
cool I dig this products like this this
one doesn't have really any scent at all
which is fine with me
I like products like this because I
shave all of this so moisturizing that
area is key for me so I'm interested to
try this out I've used this once or
twice it's hypoallergenic and perfume
free which is good for aftershave you
don't want something all scented and go
home alone
my next product that I got with the Aiko
fat liquid eyeliner in black and
actually my sister-in-law got her
Birchbox before I got my Birchbox and
she tried it and she's like oh my gosh
this is so impossible to use and I have
use this I'm actually wearing this today
and it is very difficult to use I do
want to use it a few more times before I
give you a full review but it's like a
marker tip it is very very black which
is nice but I'm looking forward to using
this more to see whether I can
get used to using such a large fat
eyeliner because I'd really prefer the
thin one so we'll see what happens it
does say for big bold dramatic eyes so
we'll see whether we can make it a
little less big and bold my next product
is a cologne and this is English laundry
Oh de toilette arrogant the packaging is
cool it's pretty rad
this says meet your new all-weather set
at first spray it's fresh and grassy
with a hint of citrus and spice but it
mellows out as it moves into the heart
of lavender and coriander settling on a
warm base of sandalwood amber and musk
this does not have a spritzer built into
it it's uh you pop it out and it's got
like a little long thing so not my
favorite packaging I haven't met an
English laundry product that I haven't
liked so far so my next product is by
Coastal Scents and it's the style eyes
eye shadow sampler they do have the
full-size at the Birchbox shop I got
these two little shades here there's a
cream shade and then a like shimmery
burgundy shade I just swatch these while
John was describing his i swatched those
two shades for you so far I'm actually
not very impressed with this at all the
Pinker the burgundy shade is kind of
chunky and the cream shade needed a
little bit of building in order to get
up to this opacity I have not used this
on my eyes yet so I definitely want to
use it on the eyes to give a full review
but I'm a huge Coastal Scents fan and
this is not to me seem to live up to the
Coastal Scents quality so far but again
I want to try it on my eyes for the full
review my last product is my lifestyle
product for the month and this is a cool
beanie hat this is hand crocheted this
is by a company called crochet kids and
um there is there was a tag on and said
look inside your product to see who made
it learn her story and how you're
helping at crochet kids org so I was
interested in this product from the get
because I was like what's up with this
you open it up it's got a tag inside and
it's signed by the lady who made it for
me and her name is Elena
Stella Alanya Stella most likely
I did go on the website this was hand
crocheted in Uganda which is pretty
awesome the deal with this company is
instead of going in and giving people
like aid they provide job opportunities
for people currently they're operating
in Uganda and also in Peru
and they've gone they've given them
resources they taught the people how to
crochet and they're turning out all
kinds of cool clothing items like hats
and scarves and you know different stuff
like that I think gloves so this is
pretty cool this fits awesome it feels
great and it's nice to know that it goes
towards the good cause and then my last
product is by MSD skincare at home it's
a lavender and bergamot body nectar and
I was wondering what in the world is a
body nectar it does it's basically just
a mix of different oils and you can use
this on your hair for flyways you can
use it as they say you can use it to
tone your skin the my big thing about
this so far is it's extremely extremely
fragrant it like it you can really smell
the scent the lavender and bergamot so I
used a little bit on my hair today and
it did take my flyaways very very nicely
but the scent is way too strong to put
anywhere near on my face this is not
going on my face I might use it as a
hand moisturizer things like that but so
far no scare to this just because it's
so sensitive so sensitive
so we will fully snap these down next
month remember don't forget to subscribe
