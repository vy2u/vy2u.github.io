bandwagon jumper but we're gonna do an
Ipsy versus Birchbox box opening because
I have just too many videos to shoot and
I just I need to compile some and I know
that a lot of people do the observer's
Birchbox that'll not be an original but
I don't have time to shoot two separate
videos so we're just gonna put them all
on one okay you guys good with that
all right good my friend Erica from
brains to beauty always says if C vs.
Birchbox I know that eleventhgorgeous I
think was the ones that were the ones
that started MC vs. Birchbox their
videos are amazing I wanted to show you
both of these and then we'll do a little
comparison at the end well go I'm gonna
go ahead and start with birch bark I
think actually I think Lacey keith does
FC vs birch bucks - yeah she does she
does and she actually gives them like
scores and has like a whole like who's
winning right now kind of thing which is
really cool and unique but if you're new
to birch box or FC or both they're both
$10 per month and they are subscription
service so it's recurring and you get
them until you cancel them this is only
my second birch box so my first one I
really really liked so I'm excited to
try this one and hopefully it is just as
good as the last month alright so we're
gonna go ahead and open that that's way
it looks inside with the pretty pink
paper and we get the card it says more
good as any Thanksgiving feast can
attest blablablablabla and it's got the
products on the back that I'm not gonna
look at and then we get a thing called
it says you're invited Birchbox holiday
2013 and it looks like it just has a
bunch of different suggestions of things
to buy on the Birchbox website creme de
mano toca Cleopatra grapefruit and
cucumber hand cream now I was in Sephora
the other day and I smelled some of the
toca perfumes and they smelled amazing
so I'm actually going to open this
because I think yes it's got one of
these little seals on here so I'm gonna
open this I want to smell it because I
really really like the perfumes that I
smelled from them oh yeah it smells
amazing I'm gonna go ahead and try this
on because I want to see how it feels
it's definitely got like a fruity berry
kind of settle with a little bit of
floral in it it's a little greasy let me
be honest it's a little greasy but yeah
it definitely is now absorbed my hands
don't feel greasy or oily anymore
so I really like this happy to have that
alexsei style firm hold hairspray I'm
not always crazy about getting hairspray
I don't use a lot of hairspray but okay
sure not too excited about hairspray
then we get this little thing here and
uh I already have one of these this is H
Ella ivory lace highlighter and I've had
this for probably about six months and
you can see how much I've used of it
it's okay it's fine I don't like it in
my waterline it's cheek cakey but I do
use it as an inner corner highlight
sometime and blend it in so it's fine
are they the exact same one yep exact
same one so this is definitely either
going in my giveaway box or going to a
friend actually you know what it'll go
to one of you friends whoever wants this
if you want this chela highlighter
comment down below and I'll send it to
you whoever comments first can have it
now I'm a little disappointed about this
because I saw a lot of people got
chocolate and chocolate next to my
children is my favorite thing in the
entire world and I got tea my mighty
leave vanilla bean artisan whole leaf
pouch black tea so I got vanilla bean I
got green tea and I got organic African
nectar and I got three bags and if I
love tea this will be great I'd be
excited about it I just don't like tea I
don't enjoy tea I am going to be giving
these to my mother but yeah I really
want to chocolate fun so did your
children okay I guess Birchbox you don't
know me as well as you said you did
that's all we got really that's it wait
am I missing something here oh there is
something else in here oh okay here we
go
really oh look fresh nail polish remover
acetone free fresh Tuscan orange scent
nail polish remover I've used these
before
they're awesome but I don't travel much
so I don't really have much use for that
you keep them for travel but mmm so
overall the only thing that I think I
will actually use in a splurge box is
the lotion that's it and I'm not even
that excited about it it's good but I'm
not that excited about it so overall
Birchbox is a big stinker Oni and I'm
hoping that MC kicks its Birchbox butt
alright the kids just got home so I
apologize for anything
weird random noises so I'm gonna go
ahead and open up my Epson bag it's a
bag please do me good it's a bag come on
it's a bag alright the first thing I'm
seeing is something from em cosmetics
now I've really really wanted something
from em cosmetics but this stuff is so
stinking expensive so I just I'm very
happy to have the opportunity to try
this what is it
happy now the opportunity try it I don't
know whether this is that's how big I am
I'm trying something from his line it's
the lash gallery lengthening mascara and
I'm not gonna open it all the way up
because I already have a ridiculous
amount of mascara is open so that is
that and I will let you know what I do
open it probably in about a month or so
what I think of it now next up I see oh
yeah mail teeny I love nail teeny I've
only disliked one of the nail to nail
polishes that I've gotten so far and it
was a glitter one it was gold glitters
with like green it was weird and the
glitters were weird random shapes and I
just hated it I love both of these there
to cut polishes love them curse to see
which one I got here let's see what's
easy oh it's a grey and it is in caviar
cocktail and it looks kind of similar to
my pink nail right now these are formula
X nail polishes I will have a review of
these up very very soon no formula X
ones from Sephora but anyway back to
nail tini love nail tini very happy to
have that next if I see a pixie and
usually like pixie products I've never
had success with the pixie product
except for I did like the lip crayon a
little bit it was okay I don't reach for
it often but we'll see what this one's
like sorry the video game noises alright
so that is the way that looks
and os2 have yucca swatch on here hold
on will swatch it over on my other hand
and it's a very very very light I don't
know how in the world they call this
it's a bronzer but it is so light weird
okay so baked eyeshadow by BH Cosmetics
is the next thing in here so if I can
open this oh galaxy chic I hope this
isn't too sparkly oh wow that's
crazy-looking
that's cool look at that that's me too I
like that
whoa yeah that's so exciting it's called
asteroid mu that's me
can't wait to try that very very happy
about that that looks cool and then the
last thing I see in here is this star
looks topaz pencil I am going to open
this because I'm just too curious I have
to see what it is
okay so let's see what color is it so
it's grey oh I'm so excited about that I
wanted a really good grey liner oh it's
like a silver box oh so happy about that
yay really excited yeah I think epsy
blew away the birch box this month the
other thing I wanted to show you is I
want to thank those of you that have
signed up for epsy using my link I was
able to get a 1,000 point perk this time
