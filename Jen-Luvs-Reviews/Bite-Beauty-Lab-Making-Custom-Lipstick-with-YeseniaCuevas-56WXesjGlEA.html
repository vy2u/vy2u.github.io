all right here my beauty yes we're here
at the bite Beauty labs we're gonna go
get some lipstick down this yes you've
never met her yet have you so this is
just a new clay machine is our what's
the makeup drugstore reporter and we
decided since we're both going to get
generation beauty that we would comp and
make lipsticks together so I'm so
excited to see how this process goes and
you guys know that I love my bite
lipsticks so it'll be really fun to make
my own lip color so I'm debating on
whether I'm getting at 1 or 2 or did you
say it says she wants to get choose you
know I'm gonna I want to get to I don't
know so we're gonna show you the process
it adjusted in there I'm gonna flip you
around and we'll show you how this all
works we're gonna start with some scrap
products so go ahead and write about
what you have on okay we're gonna do
some Supra to start
sweet I need that bullying is good
listen you leave on that's leave a liver
man oh I love this stuff okay cuz it
feels really good I don't want to leave
it on feels amazing so texture wise we
have a shear and shiny a creamy and
hydrating are more matte Ramez I don't
like my lipsticks to look like paint
like I like them to be like a little
more sheer but I also like a matte
finish to some time so I'm kind of like
maybe she like pretty creamy can we're
done okay sorry pencils know my habits
that's the textured goes but it okay
pigmented good it has a lot of shine to
it like okay any wearing
I mean it has okay it's a little shush
on yeah nice okay your drive at but we
get our shot Matt and then go down into
a shoe okay that'll be great what's kind
of counter I was looking for like a
purple brown punting like uh dark or
like a medium like it's like not too
light but not too dark time somewhere in
the middle kind of like mommy yeah like
a mafia exactly do you want it like your
lips but better type of me yes more
purpley maybe a tad bit more than your
lips but better but around that family
so we'll start with the man that we
can't kind of okay
so what is that you're making what
doesn't and that's the base okay
I like what you're putting down there
good good I think it's beautiful looks
good like I love that color on you when
your skin tone that is gorgeous
like that
since our doing the math I'm gonna have
you to squat the lip balm okay
let's give this a try as the starting
point between you and I turned our
people around
that's what it looks like here
around
curly brown that's mommy brown
because I miss it feeling missing that's
bright and that's her Nate it's so
pretty
or Macklin since are so many communities
shinier years
version that I started
nobody Thank You Sonia
yeah yeah I should
I like it
lighter just a little bit later a
Hogwarts and they're more like glass
they're more tan kiss we're shopping in
here did you like the matte texture the
way it felt if it doesn't feel mad it
feels very moisturizing and amazing
most people would be like what do you do
for a living oh my make looks
for a living like what a criminal gonna
be able to say you're always good one
it's amazing
confused by it I like what you're doing
there
it's a little less of the purple a
little bit more of the community that's
a more of your lips but better look at
things you got going on there
so take off what you have a bun you can
use there an eclipse stick remover in
the body an air lipstick remover
look at that like that's attractive I'm
a mess
though I have is that different
there's my lips just in half this one's
the more blue or like deeper or what I
like I like that side better this time
I'm thinking about too much I could be
like that's just my personal opinion
see it's like I love this color but do I
need a nice lipstick that this color
look beautiful look at that
this is my cat like weird work look at
the teeth the teeth this is one I can
wear to work though I like this hand too
and I'm middle I'm like one like Hitler
a minute later yeah I don't know if I
want it darker though I don't know if I
want darker if I want more does this
happen to you a lot where people are
very into site up I don't know what I
want I don't know what I'm looking for
like I need some some Pantone swatches
or something like we got some pay its
own booklets in here my friend Sandra
Sandra loves makeup she's gonna punch me
over this lipstick she's always trying
to get me to do lipsticks this darker
and she's gonna be like shed why'd you
get the same lipstick always got it I
mean it really I like the one you had on
you I would look like a clown I think
that all around
she's mixed some stuff up for me trying
to trying to get my perfect shade
because she's a pro like that and
they're awesome here but look what's
happening over here we got some magic
happening it's a little bit more
perfectly
your dress oh yes that looks better I
don't know in this color got some
sunlight going on artificial sunlight
see that is a color that I don't know it
is but it's a little more purple I can
wear this to work I could also wear this
for filming multi-purpose and these are
like magical like they're they're
perfect for what we're doing here model
of what into picking out these little
swabby things and I could go
I think this might be the winner Sanders
still not gonna be happy with me because
it's not bright enough but I ain't
getting number eight one it's not gonna
have shade so let's go ahead and try
this one
whoo that's BAMF it
it's funny cuz the swatch download don't
look like the round is a previous
sunlight
oh there is a phone good thing I got a
good case
so that's beautiful for filming
there's some please
that's a good film in lipstick I don't
know I don't know where are you
why can't you be here telling me which
one again because I know you know which
one is the best one to get and you're
not even here to help me so next time
you need to come with me so you can help
me because this is not this is you sent
out I mean help no look at that ago
pretty I've actually made no colors who
you are yeah well if you can tell no I
don't know man I don't know what to do
never find them a good read so what are
you getting I'm getting this one and
they're they're just a shade like
different but there you go mm-hmm yes
they do the Ojai full house like I'm
horrible about getting like colors that
that you got because yeah like I said
well our skin tones are different me
being such a light skin tone what looks
good on me is not gonna look good on you
will look good on you is not gonna look
good on me so it makes me very personal
I'm gonna try this can I try a little
further there we go now we're focused I
have to cover up the person who works
here cuz I'm not allowed to film her if
I can film Yesenia
looking good looking good you see that
mm-hmm
mine look it's the same color but you
wouldn't know it no looking at they
looked our leader has a completely
different lipstick exact same so that's
why swatching on someone your skin tone
is so so important like seeing the
swatches on someone your own it's
actually one of the major reasons I
start to do my channel English it's
because I have a very unique skin tone
and I can never find like what stuff
looks like I mean and there's probably
people out there that have your skin
tone that want someone who has your skin
tone to do some lip swatches yep makes a
big difference it does so I'm gonna get
this one and then I'm gonna get the
first one that you saw we get to think
of fragrance what it's not very nice and
now I have to smell oh that smells good
it's very mild like it's not super
strong sex I know something you don't
like super strong scents the berry while
Barry and violet violet is definitely
not my taste I'm not going to enjoy the
violet try cherry the cherry is very
very very very very sweet like almost
like candy sweet
TriMet snow
it smells minty like minty lip balm
definitely and then citrus mango that
one's very strong as well so the more
mild ones are definitely the mango and
the wild berry in my opinion because I'm
probably gonna go with one of those
because I don't really like super super
strong sets so I'm gonna go ahead and
that's why it smells familiar
negative succumb I feel like I've got
lipstick all over my face
oh I think I might do the mango maybe
and I you know what I might do one in
one shade and then one for one shade and
one for the other shade because I'm
almost feeling like that cherry one even
though it smells really strong it smells
good
maybe it's an aluminum would the vanilla
smell amazing
yeah the cherry cherry vanilla sounds
great so cherry vanilla for the first
one for the yes for the day after the
lighter one and then we'll do mango for
the other ones just straight mango and
let you have a recommendation for a mix
I actually like cherry maple cherry
mango let's do it - let's do cherry
mango that cherry really does have a
really wonderful cheer used to sing that
in our little strobe they use oh great
the last decision you gets bigger
packaging okay so here we go I always
like this one it looks like it's gotten
a bite out of it this one always makes
me happy when I see it it just looks
like a bite lipstick when it looks like
this okay where they're melted they're
just cut based on the ratio we did we're
mixing so now I'm gonna melt them down
if I write it down on which ones didn't
you points the ones you so you maybe
another time next time you drive 14
hours to New York City and that's the
one you're getting it's Christmas time
yes I should just melted it down it's
cool man that's the sense
whoo
spin it real good oh nice
Spencer lives like okay normally such a
finish would separate liquids since
we're listening it for five seconds of
lens I'm rambling summary
so those are the more
greater one
little bit more mathy one
and they're just going to sit on the
pulling table here for five minutes to
Martin
they're hardening they look almost the
same but when you swatch them down there
they look totally different it's so
funny go so that's got five minutes to
sit there and harden here come you son
yes
right now the way the other way we're
both going the same thing there are you
sent as colors going in
and there we go ladies and gentlemen we
have lips
on
there is the more natural mommy
supercool folders are a little bit
brighter Thanks that moisture there
looks really neat so you want to give
them about before rewind this they can
settle in the tubes
so they come back to room temperature
but then you're good to go nice thank
you so much and they will deploy the
card so you'll know which ones which
okay great so next time you're visiting
if you need a refill cool
super-nice
there you go we have lipsticks oh that
was so fun really enjoyed that
right looky around that was super super
fun you said you're still waiting for
yours to cool so we'll come back in a
second and show you the ones just sang
you God so those are you sending us
shades let me see if I can get it in the
light they're just like these beautiful
reds and one's a little more brown and
they're just absolutely gorgeous but
it's so funny how similar they are in
tone and then the house somewhere mine
wearing tone like people really like we
love our colors like we get to the
colors you feel that comfort zone and
you're like yes that's my color it's
just funny how we both did that I mean I
know I'm here I was thought about
stepping out but you know you always
think about it but then when you're
investing in a white lipstick you want
it to be a color you're gonna wear and
you know yeah so because it's an
investment girlfriend this is not yeah
yes it's for you sent the best gift yet
