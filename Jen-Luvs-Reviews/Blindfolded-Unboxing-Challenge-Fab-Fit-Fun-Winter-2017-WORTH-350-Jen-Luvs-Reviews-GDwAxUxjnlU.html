2017 fabfitfun unboxing is this sent to
me by fabfitfun it is a lot of fun to
unbox but I figured I'd make it a little
bit more fun and we're gonna blindfold
me I'm gonna I'm gonna blindfold myself
and I'm gonna see if I can guess what
the products are in this I saw Cora from
vintage you're tacky do this and I
thought it was super fun so I'm copying
her and I'm doing it this month and
you're gonna be able to see the products
and I won't and I'm gonna make a
complete idiot out of myself so if
you're interested in seeing that stay
tuned that fun does sponsor these videos
and I do have an affiliate code that I
can link down below what I'm really
affiliate code it's a discount code
there is a difference an affiliate code
I earn a commission this one I earn no
Commission its JG 10 and it'll get you
$10 off of your first box I do not
benefit if you sign up for this box my
payment with fabfitfun is already taken
care of it's a flat rate it doesn't
matter if you sign up or not it just
makes me look good if you sign up and
they'll continue to send me them if I
get them enough customers and that's
really that's how it works that's how
you break it down fabfitfun focuses on
beauty fashion wellness fitness things
like that and it's all full-size items
you never get like little dinky samples
it's always full size favit fun is a
seasonal subscription box it only comes
four times a year and it's fifty dollars
per box but it always contains over two
hundred dollars usually like three
hundred dollars worth of stuff inside
monetarily three hundred dollars worth
of stuff but you have to decide whether
it's the stuff that you will actually
use is it fifty dollars worth of stuff
for you if you saw it in a shelf for
fifty dollars would you buy it
that's the question so that's what we're
gonna be answering right now so as you
can see right here the box is taped I'm
gonna go ahead and get my scissors and
we're gonna cut that open cutting the
box and now we are going to use now
we're going to use a previous fabfitfun
thing that I got it's like a shawl thing
that was not my fashion and I haven't
passed it on to anybody yet and we're
gonna put this over my face
all right I cannot see anything I've got
it super tight around my eyes I'm gonna
make sure it's nice and tight and we're
gonna open this
I did not see fabfitfun did not send any
spoilers this month so I have no idea
what is in this box okay so this is the
newspaper that has all of the
information on it as far as what's in
here
I can't read it obviously here's a card
I don't know what this says and there's
some paper that I'm ripping and this is
what's in the box okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and see if I can figure out what
this stuff is by feel and then at the
end I'll look and see what things
actually are so this right here is a box
and I'm thinking this is some kind of
cleanser that is my guess some kind of
no well maybe it could be it's a tube so
this is maybe a facemask some kind of
mask thing maybe a mud mask we're gonna
say this is a mud mask I'm gonna flip it
both ways because I don't know which way
is the front I don't know I don't know
what's happening here it goes this way
probably most likely I don't know which
side has the words on it I can't do it I
don't know what it is okay so I'm gonna
guess that it's a mud mask okay let's
say what is this this is some kind of
jewelry I feel like oh it's some kind of
necklace I believe looks like this how
does it open
I hope there's nothing in here that's
difficult to open because I am NOT going
to get my scissors out while I'm
blindfolded I'm just gonna rip it it
looks like it feels like not looks likes
I can't see it feels like some kind of
multi layered necklace I'm going to
guess that it is gold ish know it well I
don't know it doesn't really feel like
metal it feels like some kind of beads
there's definitely beads on here I don't
know if I'm gonna like this oh it just
fell off the thing where's the back of
it there's there's definitely be some
kind of beads on here and then it hangs
down here that's weird why is it hanging
down because it's only hanging seems to
be hanging down on one side unless it's
like broken is it broken I don't know
what's happening here I'm very confused
it's like hanging down on one side I've
never seen a necklace that hangs down on
one side and not the other well I guess
I haven't seen it now either we're gonna
see it in a minute okay let's see what
is this there's a box in here
it's a box and there's something soft in
it and then you have in here some foam
also something delicate oh it's a mug
it's a coffee mug and I have a feeling
it says something about coffee and
waking up to something nice like hello
sunshine or something like that if you
look very nice mug I'm definitely gonna
be using this I love mugs I'm a big
coffee drinker in the morning I have my
one cup of coffee and then I use my
coffee mug the rest of the day for water
I drink water the rest of the day so
this is something hard and rectangular
and it's in bubble wrap so it must be
delicate very oddly shaped it feels like
it might open does it open no those is
there oh it does open I don't know what
it is smells like it might be some kind
of makeup I don't know there's something
okay there's a mirror here so it's some
kind of palette maybe yes it's a palette
it's a palette I'm gonna say based on
the size of the pans that it's an
eyeshadow palette it's got a texture to
it that's weird and then there's like
some kind of little door here there's a
door what is this what the world oh
there's something there it's not cream
though I have no idea what this thing's
for I don't know but the door came off
I'm very confused there's some kind of
something here what is this there's like
a J or something right there is that I
don't know but it sound like some kind
of palette it feels kind of cool it's a
neat neat shape but um it's definitely
some kind of makeup okay and then we
have in here feels like a blanket ish
kind of thing let's open it up and it is
definitely a blanket and I'm going to
guess that it is plaid am i right is it
plaid but it feels very soft it feels
very nice I'm excited to have a blanket
I like at night when I'm editing
the kids are in bed and my husband's in
bed and I'm sitting down and I'm editing
I like to have a blanket so I'm excited
to have a blanket that might be plaid it
might be plaid I think it's cuz they've
given us plaid stuff before oh it sucks
I think it sucks Long's hot socks
this is a secret these are definitely
gonna be passed on I don't like my feet
to be hot so this is gonna be a no for
me I don't care what's on here
I'm guessing it's snowflakes but this is
gonna be a note because I don't like my
feet to be hot I'll give these to my
daughter because she likes to have warm
feet so forgive the dessert and then is
there anything else in here oh there's
more stuff okay so this is something
it's another tube of stuff I'm gonna say
this is a leave-in conditioner because
that's it fun likes to give us lots of
leave-in conditioners so that's what I'm
gonna say this is or a heat protectant
cream which one will it be
we're gonna go with leave-in conditioner
maybe both will say both okay on the
floor oh there's more and then what is
this
it's like Christmas but blindfolded it's
sticky why is it sticky why is it rough
it's like rubbery sticky what is this
thing yeah what did they give me what is
this it's sticky and smells funny
is it a balloon it's like a bow maybe
it's an exercise ball I bet you it's
some kind of exercise ball because it's
bad fit fun because it's got a little
blow-up thing oh that's cool that's
really neat I don't know I don't know
what I'm going to do with this I'll give
it to my children and let them play
outside with it I guess but it feels
very sticky why is it sticky I don't
know why it's sticky that's weird though
I feel like there's a little pumpy thing
in here too to blow it up all right
let's put that down there so I don't get
lost in what I've already opened okay
there's a card here I don't know what
that goes to what is this okay we have
one more thing and it's a box that's
some trash in here I think this is the
pump for the ball thing I think that's
what I'm gonna guess this is I think
it's a pump for the ball
then we have a bunch of worms yes this
is it Wow there's lots of stuff in this
box up I'm only hoping the camera is
still recording good that would be such
a shame if it wasn't okay this is a box
let's open it okay uh it's definitely
not a box of cards oh it's i jealous I
bet you know what are these the skin
iceland a gels they might be there's
some kind of these are like for
underneath your eye i can feel it i know
that they are there for underneath your
eye I think these are the skin Iceland I
just if I'm right I am a genius no I'm a
psychic I'm a psychic if these if I'm
right but they definitely feel like I
gels like where you put them underneath
your eyes all right so now I'm ready to
find out what you already know I'm gonna
go ahead and take off my blindfold my
lashes are sticking to my face how is my
makeup I probably look a hot mess
camera phone oh it's not that bad I am
kind of drooping a little bit over here
we're just gonna go for it my vamp stamp
wing did good today's the first day I
did the vamp stamp so I'm excited about
the vamps stamp it's still on there
really well oh they are eye gels I was
right there anti-wrinkle energizing eye
masks from Grace and Stella it's like an
energy drink for your eyes so I was
wrong about the brand but I do like eye
gels I think they're fun alright let's
see okay the blanket was not plaid it's
black striped okay I was quite a clothes
kind of bloke okay let's see the mug it
says love you a lot say oh that's cute
it didn't have anything to do with the
morning but you know then we have the
Ahava mineral hand cream darn I said it
was a I said it was for your hair so
this is from deuce I've heard of this
braid I don't think I've tried anything
from them and it is an eyeshadow palette
and then there's a highlighter in here
so what was the deal with it coming out
I guess it's just removable but it's a
highly removable highlighter okay cool
and then this was a Kate Somerville all
skin types exfoliated intensive
exfoliating treatment aha okay so I got
that wrong too
this is fabfitfun TV and it is an
exercise ball and I was right about the
socks I was very close as far as it
having snowflakes on it it does have
snowflake colors so that's cute okay
here's the necklace I was wrong about
the beads it's very odd oh I see how it
goes so it's not on the side it actually
hangs in the middle here and then it
kind of hangs like this I don't know if
you can see can you see that where it
like hangs down in the middle okay this
is not I don't know it might look right
with the right shirt and it's not gold
it's like a rose gold pinky kind of
color
I thought these these do feel like beads
but they're not beads so let's look and
see and make sure that I got everything
oh I was wrong this is not a blanket but
God you can okay this is not a blanket
this is a shawl it is a BB Dakota poncho
in black charcoal or mulberry I still
thought it was a blanket even after I
looked at it I still thought it was a
blanket it's a poncho for me it's gonna
be a blanket most likely well this is
like this this the thing that I had
around my eyes was like a poncho thing I
don't know it's just not my style man
that's a $70 poncho thing Wow holy moly
that dude's a pallet is $70 oh my gosh
and the exfoliator $75 my gosh so it
looks like there was a choice item in
here you could get either the this works
deep sleep pillow spray or the Nelson J
Beverly Hills moisture healing a hair
mask and coconut scent sometimes they
don't send the P R boxes the choice at
all and I guess that's what happened so
I'm sad I can't show you either one of
those but oh don't look like I got them
the big question is is this worth $50 to
me the eye gels I'm excited about I
really like eye gels like this I really
like the coffee mug I'm excited about
the coffee mug the exfoliate I know I've
heard great things about this product
and I've never tried it so I'm excited
about that and I know that monetarily
this is worth more than the box itself
but I would never have paid full price
for this and I don't even think I would
have paid $50 for a sample size for this
to try it so I mean I now that I have it
I'm
to have it but I wouldn't have purchased
this on its own the eyeshadow palette is
a neutral eyeshadow palette as a makeup
reviewer I don't really need another
neutral eyeshadow palette I am thankful
to have it but it is what it is but I
think the average fabfitfun subscriber
may not be a makeup junkie like me and
they may be able to get more use out of
something like that the exercise ball my
kids are really gonna like that on the
socks no hand lotion no I have so many
hand lotions I don't need another hand
lotion this probably go to my mom the
poncho thing is not my style at all and
then the necklace is I don't I'm not
really I don't know it just looks kind
of flimsy I don't know it's just not
really my personal style but maybe with
the right shirt I'll end up liking it so
overall I don't think that this would be
something I would purchase if I saw it
on a shelf for $50 but that's because of
my own personal tastes you may have a
different personal taste and you may
think that this is awesome and if you do
think it's awesome you can subscribe and
get this exact same box it is still
available it is the winter box and you
can get the same things monetarily is
worth well over the $50 you get a ton of
stuff but it's just whether you
personally will use those things or not
so I want to thank you so much for
