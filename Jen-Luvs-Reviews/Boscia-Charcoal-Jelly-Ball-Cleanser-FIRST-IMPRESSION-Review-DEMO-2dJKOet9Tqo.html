impression and try out of the Boscia
charcoal jelly ball cleanser you pop
this thing and then it's jelly and you
rub it all over your face and it cleans
your face and I thought that would be
oddly satisfying and wonderful so I
wanted to share that experience with you
right now I first saw this product on
raw Beauty Christie's Channel and I was
so excited when I saw how much she
enjoyed it we're gonna get the ball out
of the packaging while we talk about it
because I just have to feel what this
thing feels like even before we do
anything ok so it's got this tape around
it that you remove and then inside it's
like a legit balloon look at that that
is crazy oh my gosh some jelly just fell
off that is weird it looks like a
crystal ball like that this thing might
be able to tell my future when will I
get 100,000 subscribers will it ever
happen it's not telling me I wonder why
this is made by bozhe one thing that I
found very interesting is that Boscia
says that they do not use preservatives
in any of their products which I found
absolutely fascinating because I that's
just like not possible to me so I read
up on it and it says because
preservatives in skincare products are
one main cause of skin irritations
bozhe uses state-of-the-art Japanese
technology along with its unique
manufacturing and filling process to
ensure the products are free of
preservatives stay fresh and are
exceptionally effective they do
recommend using up any of their products
within 6 months one thing you do need to
know about bozhe is they are not cruelty
free this is what they say they say as
we continue to expand into international
markets we are unable to control the
testing methods used by outside
governments they neglect to mention that
they can control that they do sell to
these countries that do animal testing
which the wording is a little irritating
all products are 100% gluten
free however but the product does
contain latex I guess the balloon is
made out of latex so if you have a latex
sensitivity you do not want to touch
this
it does say you're supposed to avoid
contact with the eyes which totally bums
me out because I was really looking
forward to using this to remove my eye
makeup so I brought my Clinique take the
day off for my eyes and then this is
just gonna cleanse my face one thing I
want to talk about when I use this as
whether it feels drying or not I find
that when I use really cheap you know
low-quality cleansers my face just feels
completely stripped where when I use
something more high-quality like it the
products that I use for what the Kay
usually my skin does not feel stripped
like that so I'm curious to see how this
one feels I forgot to mention this is
$20 and it was purchased at Sephora they
do advertise it it's for all skin types
it's supposed to help with pores dryness
and oiliness so I guess it's truly for
all skin types if it helps you with
dryness and/or oiliness that's kind of
interesting the ingredients in this the
number one ingredient is water the
second is glycerin which is a humectant
its job is to pull moisture from the air
into your skin I would worry about the
glycerin if it was a moisturizing
product but because it is a cleanser
you're you know it's pulling the
moisture out of the water and the air
and putting it into your skin which is
awesome there is a bit of concern in dry
climates with moisturizers that use a
lot of glycerin but this is it doesn't
apply to this the next ingredient is the
cleanser and then there's something
called penciling glycol which is a
humectant and a solvent and then there's
something called tamarind s indica seed
gum and I couldn't find anything
directly on that ingredient but for
tamarind it is supposed to have similar
effects the hyaluronic acid I found it
off of a website that I'm not familiar
with so please take that information
with a grain of salt I don't know if
it's true or not if you know anything
about that ingredient I would love to
know about it in the comments below
after that we have rice bran oil and
then we have a hobo seed oil then we
have another cleanser and then glucose
and then the charcoal powder so I
wouldn't count charcoal powder as being
a huge major ingredient as if that's an
ingredient that you look for in skincare
all right now we've gotten through all
of that let's go ahead and let us I just
want to stop this thing so bad okay
because I don't have running water in
this room I'm going to be using a wet
towel for this and then I will splash
water on my face after we're all
finished so the first thing we need to
do is we need to pop the ball which I'm
really excited about so I'm gonna go
ahead and bring this out
a little bit closer and let's pop this
ball together shall we alright here we
go ready 1 2 3 I'm scared of it I'm
scared it's gonna I'm scared of it I'm
gonna ruin it it's not poking it's not
working
maybe if I poke it on this side it's not
like I'm it's not working ohh ohh I
popped it well that was anticlimactic I
thought it was gonna like I don't know
what's happening oh it's oozing it's
oozing this is a post use that I said I
puncture the cleanser part oh I'm scared
what is happening what is happening here
what is happening it's just oozing out
product I thought it was gonna like pop
and be cool did I do this wrong you're
supposed to discard their wit I just
went rolling across my floor so now it
has dog hair all over it that's just
fabulous that is not what I wanted I'm
going to go rinse this off and I'll be
right back
just a quick note as I was cleaning up I
noticed that I did not understand the
directions apparently my reading
comprehension is not that great so what
I was supposed to do was leave the ball
inside the container then peel this
sticker off and then I was supposed to
Lance it right there so I wasn't
supposed to take it out and that's why
it wasn't being poked in the correct
spot and that's why it fell onto the
floor was because that is the best way
to do it and apparently I just have no
reading comprehension skills because I
didn't get that but I did want to show
you the way it's really supposed to be
done so if you do get this you do do it
correctly ok I am not quite sure what
happened but yeah so now we have the
jelly ball and it feels just like that
it feels like a giant like really solid
jiggler and you can see the suds are
already coming up a little bit on this
I'm gonna zoom you out so you can see my
face a little bit better so now I'm
gonna wet my face and then we're gonna
rub this all over my face except for my
eyes okay so let us rub ooh it's got a
fragrance to it I didn't see any
fragrance in there but it definitely has
a fragrance to it it feels very nice
it's very smooth it's definitely one of
those oddly satisfying feelings like
literally rubbing a jello ball all over
your face it's very calming I really
want to rub it on my eyes but I'm not
gonna do it okay so I rubbed it all over
my face I'm gonna go ahead and take the
day off
with this and I'm just gonna rub this on
my eyes take my eye makeup off okay and
then we're just going to use this to
wipe it off just for now and then I'll
I'll wash my face in a minute what I'll
probably end up doing with this is doing
the oil based cleanser first and then
doing the the bosu-ball afterward my
eyes are a little bit cloudy I hope I
didn't accidentally get some of the the
Boscia in my eyes because I can see a
little bit of cloudiness and I'm not
used to that with the take the day off
just FYI and full disclosure Clinique
did send me this with no obligation to
review this is just the one that I've
been using regularly so that's the one
that I brought out I'm gonna go ahead
and zoom you out since I've used the
ball now and tell you kind of what I
think right now hey the cloudiness in my
eyes is still there so I'm actually
gonna go wash my face and put in some
eyedrops and I'll be right back because
it's kind of freaking me out I just
splashed some water on my face
dried my face put a couple of eyedrops
in and now I'm good so I definitely
don't recommend getting this in your
eyes the cloudy thing kind of freaks me
out a little
it I'm not sure if it's dangerous but
because it says avoid eye area I would
definitely do this differently next time
making sure not to get it in my eyes one
thing that I don't like that's the same
thing that Christy said was that she
didn't like that it doesn't have its own
like separate cool casing to keeping it
it's just got this little plastic you
know piece here and it would be nice if
it was something that was enclosed I
mean even if it was made out of plastic
something you know that that would close
on it you know and keep it in case
instead of just this box here that's
just some random box I totally agree
with her on that that's a big major fail
the popping thing was not as cool as I
thought it was gonna be so if you're
getting it for the popping experience it
definitely wasn't worth $20 for the
pumping experience my face does feel a
little bit dry of course I am going to
do the rest of my skincare routine with
the toner and my serum and my
moisturizer and all of that but overall
I mean I feel like my face is definitely
clean I didn't have a whole lot of
makeup on today I did use the fenty
Beauty foundation but I used a very
little bit I'm trying it all different
ways so you could see when you know I
started the video you could barely even
tell I had any foundation on and it's
because of the way that I applied the
Fendi foundation which was with my
fingertips which I never do but I just
wanted to try something different to see
if I will kind of finish I would get
I'll get more into it when I get into my
fancy Beauty review but yeah that was a
fail but that's why it looked like I
didn't have a whole lot of foundation on
but I did and I face definitely feels
cleansed boscia says that with proper
use the jelly ball should last up to 45
days so I am going to be switching over
to this I was using one of my Korean
Beauty cleansers the the whipped cream
one that I did a while back I was using
that one I'm gonna switch over to this
one now since since I don't want this
one to go bad I want to definitely use
it I don't know if I'm super blown away
by the way that my skin feels right now
which surprises me because it does have
a lot of hydrating ingredients in it my
skin doesn't feel bad but I wasn't
expecting it to feel tight at all and it
just feels slightly tight based on the
ingredients for this and just the bits
that I know about these ingredients it
seems like it really would be good for
sensitive
skin and also really good for dry skin
because there aren't any ingredients in
here that look particularly super drying
and also it has the hydrating
ingredients in there like the glycerin
and rice bread oil and the hobo seed oil
so if you do have dry skin this will
probably be a good nice cleanser for you
but you definitely want to follow it up
with moisturizer afterwards because I
can feel a little bit of tightness also
beware if you are sensitive to scents
this does have a scent to it it's very
it's kind of a mixture between like a
clean scent and a floral scent but you
can definitely smell it as you apply so
definitely if you're sensitive the sense
you might want to skip this one because
I think it would probably give you a
headache and bother you if you're
sensitive even though there isn't any
fragrance listed there is a strong set
in my opinion so overall is this worth
20 bucks I don't know I think that it's
how much you like the novelty of it
because it does feel amazing rubbing it
all over your face it feels really good
I love the way that it feels and it's
fun it's a fun product it's a unique
product it's a different product and if
that's worth 20 bucks to you definitely
go for it have some fun I know I'm gonna
be having fun with this I probably won't
buy another one of these after this
one's gone but the experience is
definitely it's fun it's a fun product
so I want to thank you so much for
