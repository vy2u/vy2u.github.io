pellet i have purchased in a very long
time for you to start a ware test review
for you today and it is the crayon cases
box of crayons i shadow capital i shadow
palette yeah I'm excited to show you
this and share everything I know about
this eyeshadow palette with you right
about now my glasses are so gross my
father always gets on me
he's always handing me tissues like
clean your glasses Jen drives him crazy
ER than it drives me the last time I did
a video like this was the color drained
cheers to the beauty palette and it got
an incredible response from people who
watched it everybody really liked the
format so I'm gonna go ahead and do it
again with the box of crayons oh this is
a non filming day for me even though I'm
filming which is kind of weird but it's
a typical non filming day for me it's
actually Monday I'm editing my video
that's supposed to be going up tomorrow
which is my benefit brow video where I'm
talking about all the different products
from benefit brows I will be linking
that down below in case you haven't seen
it yet it's obviously up now but in real
time
my time I'm still working on it so what
we're gonna do today is I'm just gonna
put on this eye shadow because I'm just
staying home today it doesn't matter how
crazy I get and we're gonna do an all
day wear test for this but before we do
that I do want to go into a little bit
about this brand and what they're all
about because before this palette
released I hadn't heard of them so I'm
really excited to introduce to you if
you haven't heard of them the crayon
case they are sold only online at the
crayon case calm the brand was founded
by raynelle steward her nickname is supe
she has over 750,000 followers on
Instagram and she founded this this
brand she also does makeup classes in
Houston she also does some music
promotion of different musicians and
order
in her area and I really like the the
mindset behind this brand I'm gonna read
you what it says on their website it
says the crayon case is a cosmetic line
dedicated to amateur makeup users and
aspiring makeup artists aiming to
encourage all people to treat their face
as a blank canvas as they pursue the
ultimate creation of their personal
masterpiece and I just thought that was
so incredibly well worded and beautiful
and I love that so a little bit about
the technical stuff so if you look on
the back here hopefully you'll be able
to see there is the little PETA bunny
here but I could not find that they were
cruelty free anywhere on their website
so I do have a question in to them along
with some other questions that we'll be
getting to on Twitter they have been
commenting back to some of my posts on
Twitter so I'm thinking this will be a
great way to get in touch with them and
I will update you on their answers as
soon as I can so we're working on
finding out whether the entire brand is
cruelty free or if it's just the shadows
it's also written on the eyeshadow
primer that we're gonna be talking about
it says animal cruelty free and
hypoallergenic product on the bottom
here the other thing we don't know is
where the products are made there's
nothing on here that says made in the
United States made in the PRC anything
like that I I did ask that question I'm
assuming based on the price point of $30
which is really inexpensive and ten
dollars here for the eyeshadow primer
I'm thinking it must be People's
Republic of China that's what I'm
thinking but we have no confirmation on
that yet I will let you know one thing
that's really really important is they
do not accept returns exchanges or
refunds and all sales are final I don't
know what that means as far as damaged
products I'm gonna ask her that as well
so now getting into the actual palette
this is the way that it comes it's $30
you do get 18 shades and the way that
it's packaged its packaged really really
well so I'd be surprised if any of these
break in shipping just because I just I
think that's really smart of them to put
the puffy packaging inside the box it
doesn't fill up the box completely if
you take this out and you put this in
here it's gonna jingle-jangle
all over the place so the puffy
packaging really needs to be in there
for it to feel like it's full and when I
open this I was like oh my gosh it's
huge it's gigantic
the pans are huge the other thing is
is that they do not say anywhere on the
website how big the pans are so that's
another question that I have in to find
out which hopefully will be in the next
segment for the next eyeshadow look just
to give you a frame of reference on the
on the shade sizes let's go ahead and
open this one up and I'm gonna show you
the Julia's place masquerade palette and
as you can see they look to be the same
size pans here let me just put it next
to the Urban Decay Naked heat so you can
see the size difference here I mean it's
like I would I would say eyeballing it
we've got at least three times as mount
amount of product as we do in the in the
naked heat so we're getting a lot lot
lot lots of product let's get a little
bit into the ingredients here we've got
18 shades in here they are talc as the
number one ingredient and mica as the
second ingredient so if you don't like
those for whatever reason just know it's
talc and mica base there's also an
ingredient in here that I wanted to
start mentioning because I've seen more
in the comments about this ingredient
bismuth oxychloride it's a colorant it
adds a white so it'll lighten up the
pigment to make it a little bit more
white the FDA does say that this is a
safe ingredient for cosmetics I'm
noticing more people saying that this is
causing them irritation especially if
they have sensitive skin so definitely
if you're having any kind of reaction
any kind of eye shadows check and see if
it has this bismuth oxychloride in it I
have never had any problems with this
ingredient but I do want to start
mentioning it the preservative in this
is phenoxyethanol which is the
replacement that a lot of companies use
instead of parabens but phenoxyethanol
also has people that are allergic to it
so I figured I would mention that as
well it is not lip safe because it does
have some pigments in here like
ultramarine blue and chromium oxide
greens that are not lips safe talking
about the packaging in general so it
looks like a box of crayons and I did
Google to see whether the word crayon is
copyrighted it is not Crayola is
copyrighted but not the word crayons
they don't have to worry about getting
in trouble with Crayola fits so it's got
this giant mirror at the top and it's
not like a walking mirror it's a nice
mirror and then all of the colors are
named very basic so we've got blue green
red yellow
black-brown where it's named after
crayons I mean it's it's very cute I
mean yes it's it's I wish that they had
named this macaroni and cheese but
that's just my personal because that was
one of my favorite name crayons of all
time
it is a cardboard packaging but it
doesn't seem like cheap cardboard in any
way it is a magnetic closure here not
super strong so I would imagine if you
take this for travel to just put this in
an outside bag somehow just to make sure
it doesn't open up kind of flick open
and travel because it's not a super
strong magnet on the back it just says
the crayon case and it has the website
here with no other information okay now
let's get into the eyeshadow primer how
adorable is this eyeshadow primer oh my
gosh I've used it once and it does have
a little bit of a sticky feeling to it
but it's not quite as sticky as let's
say the Too Faced glitter glue it does
it says goes on white dries clear I
think that that's a reference to actual
school glue it doesn't actually go on
white which you're gonna see in a minute
it's kind of got a lighter skin tone to
it and then it does seem to disappear
you do get 25 milliliters in here and
it's only $10 which is drugstore priced
for an eye primer I'm gonna read you a
little bit of the description of this it
says it allows your shadows to stick
with you all day it's a light creamy
formula it spreads easily over the lids
for a smooth matte finish long lasting
eye looks makes colors pop keeps your
eyes moisturize to minimize any dryness
on the lid it does have Capra lickin
capric triglyceride I'm assuming that's
where they got that from it says it
makes blending a breeze while securing
your color so it doesn't crease or
smudge very lightweight easy to use and
you just tap it over your cheer lid wait
for it to dry and then apply the
eyeshadow so that's what we're gonna be
doing today and now that we've gone over
all of that background let's go ahead
and throw on some of these eye shadows
so the first thing I thought of when I
got this I was like what was I thinking
I have no idea how to use an eye shadow
tell it like this no idea so what I did
was I looked on Instagram and I just I
just straight-up searched for the
hashtag colorful eye looks and this was
a picture that I saw when I looked that
up and I'm gonna use this for inspo
because I seriously like if you know the
eye shadow looks like typically create
they're all pretty much the same thing
but with different
and I can't do that with this I don't I
don't even know how to start with us one
thing I forgot to mention about the
ingredients is there are quite a few
typos that are both on the bottle and
also on the website for example there's
a ingredient in here called enter inin a
and I couldn't find a single thing
online about that ingredient so I'm
thinking it might be a typo they also
have something called you so purified
water
they've misspelled the word
phenoxyethanol they've also misspelled
methylparaben and ethyl paraben so I am
I'm I've got some questions and about
that especially about the in Turin and
one because I don't know I can't find
anything about that ingredient and I
want to know what it is see how it's
like a light beige II skin tone here tap
this on the lids and I'm not gonna do
any other makeup today I might put some
brows on if I feel like it looks a
little bit ridiculous without my brows
I'll probably put some brows on but
we're not gonna do any other makeup
today because we're just testing
eyeshadow today so right now it does
feel a tiny bit tacky but it's not like
a glitter glue tacky it's just a little
bit tacky I'm gonna go ahead and let
this dry and then we'll go ahead and
start applying the shadows forgot to
mention this was five bucks I also got
this this is their brush cleaner it's
just one of those pad things that like
the Viera Moana color switch where you
switch your colors there so I'm gonna be
using that as we go we're also gonna be
using my motor brushes because I love
these brushes they're pretty and they
bring my heart joy now this is not a
look that I would ever wear out because
it's just not my style but because I'm
not going out today we can just play and
have fun it looks like she's got bright
pink up in her crease so let's just
start there
I'm gonna go ahead and use just a little
bit more of a dense brush to really pack
it into the crease my husband's gonna
come home he's like what are you doing
oh my gosh you might have to go to the
bus stop later it looks like she's cut
the crease with us with some concealer I
don't want to compromise the eyeshadow
primer so we're just gonna go in without
that and try to kind of cut the crease
without concealer and see how that goes
I'm also purposely not wetting my brush
because I want to see how these are
without having to let the brush I don't
see any patchiness at all and I'm also
not getting any fallout these are all
matte shades so far I forgot to mention
how many map star they've kept the
mattes over on this side so one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
mattes and one two three four five six
seven eight
fully oldish kinds of metallic shades
this one right here this purple is
actually now that I'm looking at it it
does have some a little bit of sparkle
in it so wouldn't call it a matte but I
wouldn't say it it's the same as the
foils either okay so now we're gonna go
into baby blue hmm maybe not okay I'm
gonna mix the baby blue with the regular
blue to try to get that color
oh I'm mixing the color and oops okay
well we'll work it out we'll work it out
okay so kind of try to mix those
together here I almost wish I had
started over and not mixed oops
we'll fix it we'll fix it it'll be okay
because I want that baby blue more on
the inner corner all right let's just go
ahead with the baby blue and we'll try
to cover with the dark blue in a minute
this color is cautious okay I'm gonna go
back in with the dark blue and try to
get them to blend a little bit together
what like that then she's got white in
the inner tear-duct so we're gonna go
ahead and use the white here I guess
it's not really the tear duct because
I'm not putting it actually in my eye
but the inner corner I should call it
not the tear duct that doesn't even make
any sense
I don't know where I got that from now
on the lower lash line it looks like
close-up she's got the purple and then
she's got dusted around that the pink so
let's go in with the purple and get that
real close she's got it going all the
way across hmm it's not really a dark
purple let's do this violet shade
instead because it looked like it was
kind of coming off a little bit more
pink than I wanted I seriously feel like
I need to have like crimped hair and an
off-the-shoulder neon green shirt with
some pink polka dots but totally giving
me the 1980s vibe right now yep we're
gonna dust a little bit of this pink
under that you know this also reminds me
of his Lauren May beauty I can see her
wearing a look like this with her blonde
hair she can rock stuff like this okay
where are you go just gonna use my
lighted mirror and just give it a little
bit of a blend just to make sure we're
relatively seamless here that looks
pretty good now one thing here is if I
wanted to do a brow bone highlight there
really isn't a brow bone highlight shade
in here for me this may be a highlight
for some people it's definitely too deep
for me all right I'm just gonna take my
Urban Decay Naked basics too and just
pop on a little bit of a brow bone
highlight just in the shade Stark just
to give a little bit of separation I
don't know that's kind of turning pink
in it probably should have picked an
even lighter one than that don't like it
let's get a different one all right if
one doesn't work go for the other one
let's go for a walk of shame W OS from
me a naked basics original palette
that's what I wanted
something a little bit closer to my
natural skin tone if not a little bit
lighter hmm I don't like what I just did
now now I don't like because the pink
doesn't look as pretty now mmm I think I
messed it up no grab a little bit more
pink and try to fix that there we go
I just covered up a little too much of
the pink there we go okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my brows and liner and
mascara and I'll be right back
one thing I noticed as I was finishing
this look up is that she actually looks
like she used tape to really make a
sharp line here she's also got this
beautiful gradient and going out and the
other thing is that she's got a lot more
real estate up here than I do so she's
got a lot more pink going on up there
but overall I think I did okay
recreating this look I like it I think
it looks pretty would I wear this
anywhere but around my house no but do I
think it might be wearable for someone
else
sure why not I think this would be
really fun for like a party or you know
just going out for a date night
something really fun but personally this
just isn't my style but that's what
makeup is all about it's all about
having fun and I really had fun creating
this eye look so I'm gonna go ahead and
close my eyes so you can see how it
looks right now again not perfect in any
way but I'm very happy with it I think I
did okay with the recreations
so it is currently it's very late so
we're just gonna do one evening check in
tonight it is currently 1:40 in the
afternoon we're gonna check back in in
about eight hours and we'll see how this
eye shadow war through the day and
that'll be about two seconds for you so
here comes right now all right I didn't
think I was gonna be back yet but it is
5-4 54 and I'm starting to see a little
bit of strangeness happening I'm seeing
some transfer of the blue up high I'm
seeing some creasing there's some bad
things happening so let me zoom in and
show you what's going on so let's go
ahead and look can't look with my eyes
closed what am i doing okay I'm I'm
pretty sure the blue wasn't up that
hi three hours ago I'm also pretty sure
I didn't have the creasing that's
happening in the blue area mmm the
bottom lash line still looks really good
I don't see hardly any fallout maybe a
little bit here but yeah no bueno man
like if you look up here it's like real
patchy now and again it's only been
three hours so that's not so good but
anyway we're gonna continue to wear this
I'm not giving up on it yet it could be
the primer we don't know I'm not giving
up yet
I'll see you in another few hours
alright my friends it is now
10:20 in the evening and we've pretty
much got the same situation but a little
bit worse I mean this looks really
really not good
in my opinion not that it looked perfect
when I first put it on but let's go
ahead and zoom in on the eyes the
creasing is out of control the traveling
is about the same but then now it's just
mushy mess all over my eyes this is
where I feel like we're tests over
multiple days are very valuable because
I'm not sure if this is the eyeshadow
primer or in the actual eyeshadow we're
gonna double-oh-seven up on this
expletive deleted and we are gonna
figure out what is going on with this
palette and what we need to do to make
it work and whether it's worth it to you
and that's gonna continue tomorrow good
night alright my friends it's time for
day two of the box of crayons eyeshadow
palette it is a filming day I'm gonna
film a couple videos today I've got my
Goddess provisions box is gonna be a
bonus and then the Kat Von D white new
white lipstick I'm going to show you how
that works
so that's gonna be coming up you've
already seen it it was last week I'll
put it in the description box below
today I wanted to redo the look that I
had done for what was it what's it been
make up last week no it was a couple of
videos where I had a purple eye look
I'll show you the picture right here of
what it looked like and I got so many
compliments on that look what's on your
eyes what your eyes retries so what I'm
gonna do today is I'm gonna do the exact
same look but I'm gonna change the
purple to green I mean really you can do
that with any of these shades in here
especially the matte so so yeah so we're
gonna play with this green right
here instead I thought that would be fun
so we're gonna zoom in and I'm gonna
kind of speed you through this look
because this video is already like 20
minutes long close to 20 minutes long
and we've still got one more day left
let's go ahead and start with that right
now okay before when I get going I the
way that I did this I started off with
just a matte base the way that I
normally do you can use any kind of
matte shades that are close to your skin
tone so for the crease color you want to
go a couple shades darker than your
natural skin tone and then I'm just
gonna deepen it up with a couple of
shades that are a little bit deeper I'm
gonna be using the next contour palette
for that kind of multitasking it
multi-use in it and then we'll get into
adding the color which is the fun part
I'm also going to be using the Urban
Decay primer potion because we saw the
debacle with the the crayon case one
yesterday so we're gonna ditch that
today and see if we can make a
difference with using this instead so
let's go ahead and jump into it
we were they are catching fire now your
hair burning bright in the play
oh this time could've sworn you were
mine now I hide in the rain
life is what you make of it you before
the taking it was taking it
I never die
we'll never down him
all right so that is I look without
liner and lashes I'm gonna go ahead and
add that and I'll be right back all
right I've got my lashes on and I can
actually tell you what they are for
what's because they're brand new this is
the sugarpill lash in the style lullaby
and I'm not sure how I feel about them
they're a little crazier than I'm used
to and the band is kind of stiff but
this isn't a review of those but I
figured I would let you know what I'm
wearing in case you're curious I want to
try to start putting information in the
description box I'm so bad at that but
anyway one thing I did do off-camera
which I did it on impulse and I should
have shown you but all I did was I took
a little bit more of the lime green and
just paddled it in the inner corner
still look kind of patchy so anyway this
is the let's see it's 240 oh my gosh it
is so late right now if I have anything
to show you before the 8 hour mark at
10:40 I will come back I'm hoping it's
uneventful on like yesterday and I'll
see you back in about 8 hours so yep
see you in a minute all right ladies and
gentlemen it has been 8 hours I am so
tired tonight I don't know what's going
on with me it is 10:40 did you see that
did it go by too fast here there you go
it's 10:45 at night and yeah we've got
some fading going on but it is nothing
like yesterday when we used the crayon
cases eyeshadow primer the only thing I
can think of with this is maybe I
applied too much so tomorrow we're gonna
do one eye with one kind of primer and
the other eye with the crayon case
primer to see whether it's the primer
because yeah we've got a totally
different situation going on let's go
ahead and zoom in real quick so the
first thing I noticed when I looked at
my eyes is the light green shade that
was on the inner corner is pretty much
gone that was the shade lime green yeah
there we go but we still have a very
nice I look even though it doesn't look
exactly the same we've still got the
dark green it doesn't seem to be
stretching up into the crease as much as
I remember it I don't see as much
creasing maybe a tiny bit the shimmer
and shine from the Y
shade is has faded but remember it has
been eight-hour so I expect to have some
kind of fading remember I set it down
with that NYX contour palette and then I
put a little bit of the brown shades
here on top of it I feel like in that
part of the look still looks really
really good
tomorrow we're just gonna do all shades
from this palette we're not gonna do any
other shades from any other palettes
we're gonna do rainbow tomorrow I'm
really really excited about it
so we're gonna say goodbye for tonight
let's take one more look and then we're
gonna do this oh it's so good get
involve me Oh
all right good night see you in the
morning hello my friends this is
unintended a little bit of a change of
plans today it is currently Valentine's
Day my husband invited me to go to lunch
with him for a Valentine's Day lunch
since we won't be able to go out to
dinner this year I had gotten this
eyeshadow palette in the mail yesterday
from a brand called glam light cosmetics
and it looks like this I don't know much
about this brand or the product all I
know it is distributed from Hollywood
California and it's made in the PRC and
it is a new brand because I wanted to do
a more natural look and I just got in
this palette I figured I would try that
with the crayon case glue stick because
we had such a debacle with it that first
day so I have the glue stick on my left
eye which is your right side and then my
right eye I have the all type rhymer
which is the next primer I'm going to be
using with the box of crayons palette
which I'm gonna i'm pushing to tomorrow
I'm gonna do a rainbow look I think I
already mentioned that total full-on
pride rainbow look tomorrow with this
but I did want to test this very quickly
I didn't do the look on camera cuz this
video is already long enough as it is
and we're really just testing to see the
wear time of this just a quick zoom in
on the eye look this is not like I'm not
a pro here okay I'm just going out on a
date with my husband look I've got going
on I did put on some false lashes
because I think I wanted to look extra
flirty today but yeah so that is the
look it's current
a little bit after one o'clock I think
it's like 115 so tonight I'll come back
and we're gonna see if this creased on
this eye one thing I did do differently
was I put the very tiniest amount of
this product on my eye because I think I
may have applied too much the first day
and I really want to make sure I give it
the best chance possible of doing a good
job so so yeah so we'll be back tonight
for a quick check-in on how this worked
with a different palette all right it is
currently 951 in the evening and let's
go ahead and check on the eye primer and
see how it did lets me look very little
difference between the sides I'm gonna
zoom in in a second my eyelashes are
kind of falling off but that's not the
primers fault okay so I've got a little
bit of glitter down here actually let me
zoom you in so you can see and we can
talk about it together so hopefully you
can see I've got a little tiny bit of
glitter that's falling right here that
might have been from me itching the ends
corners of inside corners of my eyes
which I do sometimes without even really
thinking about it but other than that
neither side has any kind of fallout let
me go ahead and close again I mentioned
that my eyelashes are kind of falling
off a little bit but here let's just
take them off
ring okay and now you can kind of look
and see my eyeliner is probably all
jacked up but that's not the point the
point is the eyeshadow so I don't see
any excessive creasing on this side
which is the the glue side and then this
is the oldest side they look pretty much
the same so what that tells me is
there's two things either I just needed
to put less of the glue primer on in
order for it to be effective and not
crease or this primer just doesn't work
well with their eyeshadows and we may
work well with other eyeshadows so when
I do my rainbow eye tomorrow we're gonna
put again the same we're gonna do the
same test we'll put the glue on one side
and then we'll put the older primer on
the other side and we are going to get
to the bottom of this tomorrow which is
going to be in two seconds for you see
in a second hello my friends welcome to
the last day of testing its
I'm excited about today I'm gonna go
ahead and show you the ins bow shot for
today's look we're gonna try to recreate
that as best as we can so let's go ahead
and get started because this video is
really long by the way just so you know
this is not a Christmas background this
is a winter background and technically
it's still winter so I'm allowed to have
it okay just just so you know it's not
because I've been taking down my
Christmas decorations I so we've got the
old eye primer on this eye and just the
tiniest tiniest touch just that much on
this eye so in the inspo shot it doesn't
look like she has any kind of transition
shade it's just straight color so let's
just go in
now there isn't any matte orange in here
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix
the red and the yellow to try to get
that orange I'm gonna carry the red just
a little bit further
this inspo shot is like seamless I've
definitely got my work cut out for me
oh my gosh why did I pick this picture
okay it looks like she's got a little
bit of purple on the outer corner kind
of fading into a pink oh my gosh I'm
gonna just straight-up mix the red and
the yellow that actually makes quite a
pretty orange I'm just gonna grab a
little bit more of that pink and I'm
gonna mix it with the red to try to get
that color here I don't know we're just
coming out pink I feel like it needs
more red just gonna do a little bit of
blending and a little bit more that
yellow on the inner corner I think I'm
gonna have more yellow than she does
and it looks like she's also kind of
brought it out a little bit so I'm gonna
take a little more of that read and try
to round out this edge it's fun that's
what this is all about that's what
makeups supposed to be all about it's
not supposed to be about perfection
supposed to be just enjoying yourself
and I'm having a blast so when the lower
last one she's got the purple on the
outer corner so let's do that
and this will be the first shimmer shade
that I've used we're gonna use the baby
blue in the center that looks pretty I
didn't feel like the lime green lasted
all that long so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna mix the green with the white
just to try to get the same look I am
gonna fluff a little bit of the lime
green just in the inner corner okay how
do I look
does it look the same no I think I just
need to blend a little bit more on the
outer I don't want to over blend because
I still want it to be bright that is so
fun alright so that is it I'm gonna go
ahead and do some liner and lashes and
I'll be right back there we go here's
the finished look with liner and mascara
I use the new Maybelline total
temptation mascara that they sent to me
to try out and so far I actually kind of
liked this mascara I said to not to put
on fake lashes today even though I think
the inspo shot might have fake lashes on
just because I don't want to wear fake
lashes today I don't feel like it I
don't really enjoy wearing fake lashes
if I'm gonna be completely honest many
people only wear them because I film
videos if I didn't film videos I would
not wear them but anyway let's go ahead
and zoom in on the eyes so you can see
how it looks now again this is the side
with the color whatever crayon case glue
stick one and then this one is the old
type rhymer so we'll see how that lasts
of the day I'm crossing my fingers for
the crayon case eye primer because the
first day was such a fail and I'm hoping
it was just me and not the actual
product so we will see you for a
check-in very soon it is currently 1109
in the morning and a little earlier
today so we'll be back in a little while
and check on this and see how it's doing
now it's time to say goodbye to the
crayon box because this is the last
check-in of the last look of the last
day of this video I have to tell you it
is currently 938 in the evening and it's
been what 10 hours since I put this on
and it still looks really good let me go
ahead and turn you all in let us zoom in
on the eye look
okay we are not having the same
experience we had the first day with
this eyeshadow primer with the crayon
case eyeshadow primer and I think part
of the reason might be well of course I
put on last which I'm sure is going to
be key to this the other thing is I
realized like halfway through the day
that there's no shimmers in this look
and the first day there were shimmers so
it's possible that it only reacts badly
to the shimmers so just for the sake of
the length of this video and your
valuable time I will put any updates to
the use of the eyeshadow primer the glue
eyeshadow primer in the description box
down below because we cannot go into day
five
that's insane so as of right now tip for
the bye shadow primer is to definitely
put it on with a very very thin layer
like barely tap your finger into it
barely have enough to cover your lid or
else it's going to go nuts
other than that man it looks really good
it looks really good the other day
looked really good today looks really
good let me go ahead and zoom you out
for final thoughts before I get into the
full review I'm just gonna give you some
swatches on my arm very quickly because
this video is super long it does swatch
pretty well with both a finger and a
brush I feel like you can apply these
shadows with a finger or a brush you are
gonna get more opaque color with a
finger tip than you are with a brush but
that's very typical for the shimmery
shades but you definitely can use a
brush especially like a little short C
brush you know a little smudger brush is
gonna do really really well packing
these onto the lids no worries at all in
there I really wanted to swatch this on
my medium skin tone friend Jenny and my
deep skintone friend Debbie
unfortunately I was not able to get them
for this video and I'm really sorry I'm
gonna try for the next palette video
that I do which will probably be the
Kristin Domonique palette I'm gonna try
to get them over here to do swatches on
them but I try Jenny's out of town and I
didn't get a chance to get in touch with
Debbie for it so yeah I'm sad I didn't
get their arms for this so now that
you've seen the swatches let's go ahead
and get into the full review first thing
I want to mention is that I did reach
out to the crayon case what is it
today's the 16th so four days ago
on Twitter did not hear anything back
yesterday I sent them a standard message
through their website still haven't
heard anything back so that doesn't mean
that they're neglecting me on purpose
they may just be really busy when I hear
something if I ever hear something I
will I will put something in the
description box about it either I
haven't heard anything yet or what their
response is on the different things I'm
sorry I don't have that information for
you I do wish that they had gotten back
to me but they haven't so I don't have
that info for you now as far as the
eyeshadow primer I feel like the reason
why you would buy this over anything
else would be because of the cute factor
of it I feel like it is a good primer it
is a little bit finicky as far as the
amount that you need to use on your eyes
it is a little bit sticky when you first
put it on but the stickiness does not
linger once it dries which is a good
thing but it's not like it's over the
top better than anything else and
because it is a little tricky to work
with I can't say that this is a full
recommend but it's not a don't buy it it
sucks you know what I mean it's good
it's fine it's just a little tricky to
work with now as far as the box of
crayons people that are gonna love this
of course are people that are going to
love bright colors if you do not think
that you will use colors like this there
is no point in buying this that's when
it comes down to unless you want it as
kind of a collector's item a display
item something like that if you want to
just dabble in color honestly I would
recommend getting something that has a
lot more neutrals in it with just a few
pops of color because this is really
pretty much all bright colors is it a
good quality palette absolutely it is
the only the one thing that I haven't
shown you that I'm going to show you
right now a picture of my eyes after
I've removed this when you put on like
the red the purple those kinds of shades
I found that it does stay in my eyes the
day that I wear the green look my eyes
were not stained but when I did the
purple look what I'm assuming when I do
you know when I take this off tonight
and then the first look I did for this
video my eyes were stained red when I
took it off if that bothers you you are
not going to want this but if you are a
color lover I think you're really going
to enjoy this I found the application to
be nice and smooth I found the lasting
power to be overall very good except for
that first day when I use this eye
problem
and I used it in a way that was not
functional I do not blame the eyeshadow
palette for that I blame the primer and
just the finicky nature of it I don't
know if finicky is the right word to use
but you know what I'm trying to say so
yes definitely recommend but with an
asterisk in that you know you have to be
the person that's gonna use this or the
person that's just gonna want to display
it but overall it's definitely a
positive review I had great a great
experience with it I'm very thankful to
have it it was a lot of fun it brings me
back to my teaching days it's kind of
like a mix of me
you know my elementary school teaching
days and my makeup days all in one and
it definitely was a lot of fun to use
and now I have like a straight up green
eyeshadow like this I don't think I own
a green eyeshadow like this I don't
think I own a yellow eyeshadow I don't
own this blue here you know the other
ones I kind of probably could figure it
out oh I just realized one more thing
this green is not that great this green
fades but this color is really hard to
make so I kind of get that but every
other shade that I've worked with in
this palette I've really enjoyed the
green don't count on it to last all day
that's my only thing I have not used it
with any kind of fix+ or anything like
that though so maybe that might help the
lasting power on it but for me this was
the only one that I would say it is in
any way a dud everything else is spot on
on the money definite recommend from me
to you if you are that bright color
lover so I want to thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
it thanks for hanging in there with me I
hope you found it oh hello editing Jen
here I'm an idiot
apparently I got distracted by something
I wanted to say and forgot to do the
outro but I'm kind of glad that happened
because the crayon case announced today
or yesterday that the restock of the box
of crayons palette is coming very soon
to keep an eye on their social media and
of course what's up and makeup makeup
minute and V what's up and makeup news

purchasing it speaking of that I would
love to know in the comments down below

something that you feel is for you or
