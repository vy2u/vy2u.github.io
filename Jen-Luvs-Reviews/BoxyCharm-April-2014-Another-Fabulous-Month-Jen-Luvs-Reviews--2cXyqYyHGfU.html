boxycharm once again now I have a little
bit of a sad story in that having some
serious camera issues lately and I am
actually already unboxed about half of
this so I'm not going to fake it and
pretend like I don't know what's in here
I did fake it and put the bow back on
but I'm telling you so I apologize this
not a true unboxing but I will still
share my thoughts and feelings about
this box if you don't know anything
about this box each arm is $21 a month
it is a beauty subscription is delivered
to your home and it usually includes
lots of fabulous glorious beauty
products usually makeup and some other
stuff sometimes hair sometimes skincare
and this has become my favorite
subscription and that is completely
honest for me to you and if you've
watched the last few boxycharm videos
you'll know why because typically
there's over $100 worth of products in
here if not $100 very close to $100 and
yeah that's pretty exciting before I get
into that just real quick I know people
are gonna ask me about my jewelry I'm a
nails so just real quick necklaces
forever 21 earrings are a little black
bag bracelets a little black bag nails
the coral color is bikini by Julie G and
the white is Ono something white by
julep so anyway so boxycharm I do get
this as a promotional box but I am
always very very very honest about what
I think about the products inside so
let's go ahead and see what's in here
and this is how fake I am I have the
card outside of the box because I forgot
to put it back in when I reboxed it so
it's a strike a pose winter weather is
warming up blah blah blah
something about taking selfies I don't
even know but I'm not gonna look on the
back because it has all the products on
it even though I already know about half
of them are so let's take that off and
then I will show you the first thing I
opened up was the blush by model Co we
do get a lot of model Co products in
boxycharm if you are not a fan of
getting products by the same company
over and over box you try may not be
for you because we do get a lot of
monocle products and some other brands
this blush I feel is very dark for a
spring giving of a product I have
already dug into this Glade of pits
because I was testing it I will show you
the swatches on my hand okay so this is
the finger swatch and then this is a
brush swatch I just swirled my brush in
there and then I put it there but one
thing I noticed as I was using this is
it did kick up a lot of powder which
typically doesn't bother me we'll have
to see how long this wears I feel like
this is something I might be able to
kind of pair with a brighter blush to
kind of tone it down a bit but this is
definitely something I'm going to use
probably more in the fall and winter
time so we'll hold on to that for then
the next thing I unboxed was this
glorious cool way finishing oil now I've
had hits and misses with cool way one
thing I do appreciate about cool way is
the sense of their products they always
smell not really chemically and a very
sweet smell which I personally enjoy
this is a finishing gel so you it just
comes out like gel out of the pump and
you just kind of smooth it over to your
head over your hair to smooth the way
the flyaways and that is something I
have problems with all the time so I'm
very thankful to have this next thing I
unbox was this impaled box of eyeliner I
don't know what happened to my poor
little box but I'm just going to throw
that away anyway I don't really care
this was the eyeliner it's a black
eyeliner and I think I just saw this to
watch a minute ago but we'll zoom in
again so there's a swatches that I did
I'll do one for you here too and you can
see how black that is but see even just
me messing around over past few minutes
has kind of faded these a bit so I don't
know as far as those are the old ones
here's the new one the new one does
smudge so I didn't see the old ones
fading a whole lot from the touch but
they they definitely weren't as opaque
as they were when I first put them on
the smudging thing is kind of a hit or
miss depending on what you're using it
for I don't have high hopes for this
liner I don't particularly like the lip
liner I've gotten from them it kind of
dried out relatively quickly I feel like
pencil products you know that are in the
wood pencil they dry out a lot
faster do you all have the same
experience with those or is that just me
I don't know but I'd love to know what
you think about that in the code that
was that was given to us and again this
is $21 a month so this is a really nice
amount of stuff for $21 a month
so the next thing but the unboxing the
else know that was it so everything else
is new I did just see a second ago that
we did get this bellapierre nail color
and this looks really pretty I have a
lot of colors kind of like this but
they're a lot more muted you know a lot
more calm in this this is very exciting
this bright color let's do the direct ad
okay let's see hmm hmm I'm gonna say a 2
to 3 coat polish on that one I'm
checking the thickness to see based on
the thickness of this and how it drips
I'm gonna say it's probably a 2 coat
polish maybe a 3 coat polish but it
seems pretty nice we did get a
bellapierre
eye base in the last boxycharm I also
got one I think in my Ipsy or something
I got two of them I gave one away but
you know this is the first belt this is
a second bellapierre product that I have
gotten and the eye base was just okay
for me it wasn't fantastic I know a lot
of you really enjoyed it but it wasn't
fantastic for me and then the last thing
in here looks like a lip product oh it's
by Ofra okay Ofra I love their lip
product that I got last time it's
actually if you see my channel trailer
it's actually in that channel trailer
you can see my lip color changes in the
clips that follow that I really really
like that color because it's very opaque
I bet you this one's gonna be super
opaque too yes it sure is and it smells
like cake nice and this actually seems a
little more oily than the last one maybe
that's just my imagination so that is
the swatch I'm gonna try to blend it out
a bit to see if it'll move that made a
huge mess okay let me show you the
applicator it's just a regular doe foot
applicator nothing crazy there and I do
really like this color I think I'm going
to use this a lot very very happy to get
this so in summary for boxycharm this
month that we got
the cool way finishing us oily stuff we
got the model code blush we got the
model coat eyeliner we got the bill up
here nail polish and we got the off rock
lip gloss or long lasting liquid
lipstick is more accurate and boxycharm
does an amazing job putting this box
together I don't know how they do it
including all of these full-size
products every product in here is
full-size which is beautiful and
wonderful and makes me happy as someone
that loves subscription boxes this one
once again that makes me happy I think
this is four months in a row that I feel
like everything in here is pretty
doggone amazing the only thing I am NOT
well there's two products I'm not super
excited about but I think it's personal
taste I don't think that they're bad
products is just personal taste I'm not
as excited about the blush and I'm not
as excited about the eye liner but
that's just me
personally I think there's a lot of
people that would be excited about it
and they are going to use they are gonna
be loved so thank you so much for
