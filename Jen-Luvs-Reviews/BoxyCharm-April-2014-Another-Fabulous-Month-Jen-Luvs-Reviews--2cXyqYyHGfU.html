charm once again now I have a little bit
of a sad story in that I'm having some
serious camera issues lately and I am
actually already unboxed about half of
this so I'm not going to fake it and
pretend like I don't know what's in here
I did fake it and put the bow back on
but I'm telling you so I apologize this
not a true unboxing but i will still
share my thoughts and feelings about
this box if you don't know anything
about this box each arm is 21 dollars a
month it is a beauty subscription is
delivered to your home and it usually
includes lots of fabulous glorious
beauty products usually makeup and some
other stuff sometimes hair sometimes
skincare and this has become my favorite
subscription and that is completely
honest for me to you and if you've
watched the last few boxy charm videos
you'll know why because typically
there's over a hundred dollars worth of
products in here have not one hundred
dollars very close to a hundred dollars
and yeah that's pretty exciting before I
get into that just real quick I know
people are gonna ask me about my jewelry
I'm a nail so just real quick necklaces
forever 21 earrings are a little black
bag bracelets little black bag nails the
coral color is bikini by julieg and the
white is all know something white by
julep so anyway so boxy charm I do get
this as a promotional box but I am
always very very very honest about what
I think about the products inside so
let's go ahead and see what's in here
and this is how fake I am I have the
card outside of the box because I forgot
to put it back in when I Reeboks tit so
it's a strike a pose winter weather is
warming up blah blah blah something
about taking selfies I don't even know
but I'm not gonna look on the back
because it has all the products on it
even though I already know about half of
them are so let's take that off and then
I will show you the first thing I opened
up was the blush by model code we do get
a lot of model co-products inbox each
arm if you are not a fan of getting
products by the same company over and
over box you try may not be
for you because we do get a lot of model
cool products and some other brands this
blush I feel is very dark for a spring
giving of a product i have already dug
into this quite of pit because i was
testing it i will show you the swatches
on my hand okay so this is the finger
swatch and then this is a brush swatch I
just swirled my brush in there and then
I put it there one thing i noticed ask i
was using this is it did kick up a lot
of powder which typically doesn't bother
me we'll have to see how long this
where's i feel like this is something i
might be able to kind of pair with a
brighter blush the kind of tone it down
a bit but this is definitely something
i'm going to use probably more in the
fall and winter time so we'll hold on to
that for then the next thing i unboxed
was this glorious cool way finishing oil
now I've had hits and misses with cool
way one thing I do appreciate about cool
way is the sense of their products they
always smell not really chemically and a
very sweet smell which I personally
enjoy this is a finishing gel so you it
just comes out like gel out of the pump
and you just kind of smooth it over to
your head over your hair to smooth away
the flyaways and that is something I
have problems with all the time so I'm
very thankful to have this next thing i
unbox was this impaled a box of eyeliner
i don't know what happened to my poor
little box but i'm just going to throw
that away anyway i don't really care
this was that the eyeliner it's a black
eyeliner and i think I you just saw this
watch a minute ago but we'll zoom in
again so the swatches that i did i'll do
one for you here too and you can see how
black that is but see even just me
messing around over past few minutes as
kind of faded these a bit so I don't
know as far as those are the old ones
here's the new one the new one does
smush so I didn't see the old ones
fading a whole lot from the touch but
they they definitely weren't as opaque
as they were when I first put them on
the smudging thing is kind of a hit or
miss depending on what you're using it
for I don't have high hopes for this
liner I don't particularly like the lip
liner I've gotten from them it kind of
dried out relatively quickly I feel like
pencil products
you know that are in the wood pencil
they dry out a lot faster do you all
have the same experience with those or
is that just me I don't know but I'd
love to know what you think about that
in the code that was that was given to
us and again this is 21 dollars a month
so this is a really nice amount of stuff
for 21 dollars a month so the next thing
but i unboxing else know that was it so
everything else is new I did just see a
second ago that we did get this
bellapierre nail color and this looks
really pretty i have a lot of colors
kind of like this but they're a lot more
muted you know a lot more calm in this
this is very exciting this bright color
let's do the direct add okay let's see
hmm hmm I'm gonna say a two to three
coat polish on that 1 i'm checking the
thickness to see based on the thickness
of this and how it dripped i'm gonna say
it's probably a to cook polish maybe a
three could polish but it seems pretty
nice we did get a bellapierre I base in
the last box each arm i also got one i
think in my Ipsy or something i got two
of them i gave one away but you know
this is the first built this is a second
bellapierre product that i have gotten
the eye base was just okay for me it
wasn't fantastic i know a lot of you
really enjoyed it but it wasn't
fantastic for me and then the last thing
in here looks like a lip product oh it's
by offres okay offer i love their lip
product that i got last time it's
actually if you see my channel trailer
it's actually in that channel trailer
you can see my lip color changes in the
clips that follow that i really really
like that color because it's very opaque
I bet you this one's going to be super
opaque too yes it sure is and it smells
like cake nice this actually seems a
little more oily than the last one maybe
that's just my imagination so that is
the swatch I'm going to try to blend it
out a bit to see if it'll whew that made
a huge mess okay let me show you the
applicator it's just a regular doe foot
applicator nothing crazy there and I do
really like this color i think i'm going
to use this a lot very very happy to get
this so in summary for boxy charm this
month that we got
the Akula way hip finishing up oily
stuff we got the model code blush we got
the model code eyeliner we got the bill
up here nail polish and we got the off
rot lip gloss or long lasting liquid
lipstick is more accurate and boxy charm
does an amazing job putting this box
together I don't know how they do it
including all of these full-size
products every product in here is full
size which is beautiful and wonderful
and makes me happy as someone that loves
subscription boxes this one once again
it makes me happy I think this is for
months in a row that I feel like
everything in here is pretty doggone
amazing the only thing I am NOT well
there's two products i'm not super
excited about but I think it's personal
taste I don't think that they're bad
products is just personal taste I'm not
as excited about the blush and I'm not
as excited about the eyeliner but that's
just me personally I think there's a lot
of people that would be excited about
and they are going to use they are going
to be loved so thank you so much for
