boxycharm unboxing his thing but I've
got some sad news for you to share and
I'm gonna share it with you right about
now alright so I have something to admit
to you you know usually I do the what I
you know the box from the month before
and what I thought of things and then I
go into you know what I you know what
I've got this month I have to admit you
I didn't try anything in last month's
box each arm yet and I feel really bad
about it that I didn't do it but I just
completely forgot about it and I'm not
gonna come on here and tell you that I
tried things when I didn't so yeah I
failed
well constructive criticism Kelly I am
very very sorry it was the holidays I
was spending some time with my family I
had a lot of videos I was trying to get
up and organized and I just lost track
of time and completely forgot about
trying things and boxycharm so I'm
really really sorry I didn't do it on
purpose I've never done that before
where I've forgotten to try the
boxycharm and I'm really sorry and I
will do my best not to ever forget again
and I'm sorry I do have an obligation to
boxycharm to show you the box every
single month I don't have an obligation
to them to do the reviews that's what I
try to do for you
so next month we are going to be doing
the November and December reviews along
with the January unboxing so today we're
just gonna do the December unboxing I'll
kind of give you my initial impressions
of what I think so let's go ahead and
get into that right now the theme this
month is glitz and glam and inside we
have a crown brush and this is what is
this Liz the card say this is a deluxe
blush brush and it's worth 12 dollars so
let's go ahead and open this up and see
how it feels
it's very crinkling SMR lovers listen up
it's a good sound right so it's kind of
flat I don't know if it's designed that
way or if it's just the way that it was
packed
it's very dead
so I would think that you would need
this with a lighter pigmented blush you
definitely don't want to use this with a
super super pigmented blush but I do
have some blushes that I think I can use
this with so we will try this we'll give
it a try I do like the little dig here
it's got like a little finger you know
place to hold it so that you can you
know kind of put your finger in there
and get nice and comfortable as you use
it which I personally really likes I'm
excited to try that next up we have oh I
love this mascara this is a really good
one this is the tarte hardest mascara i
love this mascara it's really really
good I don't I'm not really into
high-end mascaras as much as I was at
one point because I'm realizing the
drugstore mascaras are just as good if
not better but this was one of the
high-end mascaras that I really really
liked I do think I'm gonna open this
because I really need a new mascara my
mascaras are starting to dry out and get
old so I will be opening this and
retrying this just to make sure I've got
a good review for you ooh this is really
pretty this is by pretty vulgar and it
is their liquid lipsticks my lips are
sealed and I don't know the shade does
it say the shade name on here no it just
says my lips are sealed
lightweight liquid lipstick oh okay I
see it's called secret sabotage and it's
really really pretty this is such a mean
looking shade and I'm starting to really
love the metallic lip look has a very
mild sweet scent and I'm really looking
forward to trying this I am very excited
about this I did try one of their
eyeshadow palettes when they first came
out and it was just okay for me
so I'm really curious to try the liquid
lipstick next up we have the Beauty
basics
what is this bronze essentials and it's
this really really red toned bronzer
with some highlight strips it's very
buttery to the touch it's got these
highlight strips I don't know about this
this is it's very very orangie looking
and I don't personally prefer orange
toned bronzers so we'll see maybe I'll
be able to use it as more of a blush
I'll try it out but I can't say I'm
super excited about this product
unfortunately and then the last product
in here is the real her be fearless be a
limitless blush kit and this will be
interesting to see whether I can use
this with the blush brush that they sent
I think I might need some scissors to
open this alright so they're domed I
haven't had good luck with domed shadows
they remind me of like the urban day
okay and the Stila ones that i knew you
didn't like either one this looks like a
baked formula and they definitely look
like they are less pigmented there's
like a sparkly bronzer here a sparkly
blush and then I'm satiny kind of blush
here yeah they're definitely lighter
pigmented so that blush brush may be a
really good pairing for this I haven't
had good luck with products from real
her I actually haven't ever liked
anything from their brand that I've
tried if you've tried something from
their brand that you really like I would
love to know about it in the comments
down below
I do love their message of women
empowerment but their products just have
been terrible for me so I'm really
looking forward to trying this to see
whether it's worth it or not so so far
do I think this is worth $21 yes so far
just because I already know that I
really like this mascara and I'm pretty
sure the monetary value on this is more
than $21 and that along with the blush
brush these two for me put it over $21
and also trying the liquid lipstick I'm
very excited about that I'm definitely
less excited about the real her and the
beauty basics not very excited about
these but I'm willing to give them a try
and we'll see how it goes so thank you
again so much for watching I'm really
sorry that this is not a complete
boxycharm
review for you but I promise you I will
make it up to you next month we'll have
a nice juicy boxycharm for you so I want
to thank you so much for watching this
video I hope you enjoyed it anyway if
