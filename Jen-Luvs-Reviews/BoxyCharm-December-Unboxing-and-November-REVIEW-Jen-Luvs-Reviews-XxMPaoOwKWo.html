the November box actually worth $21 in
good usable products find out right now
my friends welcome to my full review of
the november a boxy charm and my
unboxing ish thing of the december boxy
charm so you know it will be reviewed
next month boxy charm is 21 dollars a
month boxy charm is sent to me for
review but i am not being paid to do
this video and of course that never
influences my review at all so let's go
ahead and jump into what i got in the
november boxy charm and how I felt about
everything so I have a couple of sad
stories in this box but you know we'll
get there we'll get there first product
I wanted to tell you about is a product
that I did not try again I did have a
friend tell me that the ingredients on
this are not very good but honestly I
have to tell you I did not look them up
between then and now but I trusted her
into the ingredients for this we're not
good i will leave information in the
description about the ingredients for
this i have used this product in the
past and have really really enjoyed this
i was planning on passing this on to a
friend but i may not pass it on to a
friend based on the ingredients I
honestly just got busy and completely
forgot so so yeah as far as performance
wise I've really enjoyed this in the
past it gives a very nice cooling
feeling underneath the eyes and I've
loved it but if either i'm not going to
use it because of the ingredients or i'm
going to pass it on to a friend because
i have already tried it but i have to
tell you i was excited to see it till I
heard the ingredients were no good the
next project was a big fail for me
unfortunately this is the Bel Pierre
kiss proof lip cream this is possibly
and I'm so sorry bellapierre if you're
watching this I'm so sorry to tell you
this this is probably the worst liquid
lipstick I've ever used in my life and
let me tell you why number one something
that seemed what it was good was ice
watch it on my hand and I could not get
it off my hand and I was like yes it's
going to be amazing liquid lipstick but
I have to tell you this is the most
drawing liquid lipstick I've ever tried
and that takes a lot to be the most
drying liquid lipstick I've ever tried
it was so drawing that it was actually
painful in the dry down it was so dry
that it was pulling the skin of my lips
and making my lips feel so tight and the
butthole lip that came out of this
product was insane like I could not
believe how puckery and cracked and dry
my lips look it was horrible the shade
is gorgeous and I was so sad that this
did not work for me now this is a brand
that I had not tried yet this is the
vintage highlighter by Jessica some
starts than L that I don't want a
butcher the lasting power was not good
but I did enjoy the way that it looked
on my cheeks it gave a very very natural
look to the skin it was a very subtle
highlight and just a tantot bit of a
tint to it I feel like the only people
are actually going to see color out of
this are people that are very very fair
I didn't really see enough color for it
to be significant enough for me again a
very subtle highlight as far as the pop
eNOS of it and honestly I probably won't
use this I'll probably sanitize this and
pass it on I honestly didn't enjoy it
very much lasting power was not good and
did not enjoy another one I was a little
more disappointed in was the studio
makeup on the go on shadow palette this
one is the cool one I think it's called
cool down if I remember right so I was
really excited to get this because they
had sent us a studio makeup eyeshadow
palette before that was a little bit
more warm tone and I love that one it
was so good this one was not as good for
me I did not find the shadows to be as
easily blendable I did not find the
lasting power to be the same I don't
know what happened with this I don't
know if it's just the way that they
formulated these if they formulated them
different but I did three looks with
this and I felt like each one either
muddy together or it just I don't know I
just didn't like the looks that that
came out of this palette I wasn't a fan
especially compared to the other eye
shadow palette by Studio makeup that we
got really really like this one didn't
like this one as much but then let me
tell you about this one this is the
saddest story of all this is my crown
brush you may notice it looks a little
different than when I got it and I'll
tell you why this was the only thing I
loved out of the November boxy charm and
my dog ate it I
my brushes on the floor I was filming
and my brushes were in the way and I
just set my whole brush thing down on
the floor I accidentally left my door
open and this is the only brush my dog
ate he actually picked it out of the out
of the bin and then he chewed it up and
he hasn't done that in so long and I
think the reason why is i think my dog
knew that this was made out of goat hair
and he's a cool that smells like an
animal I want to eat it so he ate it and
I did love this brush it was beautiful
it applied so nicely again this is my
crown brush I really like the little
divot here for application it was just
the perfect Chris brush to detail into
the crease and I loved it and it's dead
thanks to my dog so and my fault for
leaving it the basket on the floor I do
really like this though so I mean these
two would have been the only ones that I
think I would purchase out of this set
and I don't feel like these two things
aren't worth looking at it just so
ridiculous that this thing next to my
fake I don't think these two things are
worth the $21 price tag just based on
the quality of the other products in the
box so this was kind of a womp womp for
November for me and I told you something
different in October because it looked
to be a lot better than it was and
that's why I come back and review the
next month because it makes a big
difference so that's it for November
let's go ahead and get into what i got
in december so the first thing I saw in
here is something that I was actually
quite excited about this is the buff
collection by pure cosmetics p you re
not p you are with the little dots above
it p you re i actually gotten one of
these pallets from this brand in my fab
fit fun box i will link that video down
below and i really like that palette i
was it as good as the Naked palette that
it was clearly duping absolutely not but
I did enjoy it as a palette so can you
tell which one of these is no they're
exactly the same so when you look at
these two pallets you can clearly tell
that this is meant to be a dupe for the
naked 3
let's I have nots watched them next to
each other but I feel like Mirage down
here and black heart black heart has a
little bit more black in the base where
this is a little bit has a lot more of
that glitter in it and then mug shot and
dust dust seems to be a little deeper in
tone that mug shot Mojave seems to be a
little redder than buzz and then Sahara
seems to be a little peach year than
dust but this is clearly a naked three
attempt to be a Duke and I have not
tried this yet I'd have swatched it but
I have not tried it I have not heard
such good things from people on YouTube
about it but I'm curious to try it on my
eyes and find out for myself so I will
let you know next month next up is a
full-size ofra liquid lipstick I love
over liquid lipsticks so much oh my
goodness it's one of my favorite
formulas of all time not my favorite but
one of my favorites they gave us the
shade napa valley and we have been
getting so many new deep inks some
immunity pinks every subscription box
sends nudie Pink's because they are very
good for people with lighter skin tones
this one I feel like you have to either
be a special kind of personality or you
know have that special kind of I wanna
wear lipstick that is very bold and wild
if you have a lighter skin tone or if
you have a deeper skin tone this is
going to be insanely gorgeous on you
this is not something that I would wear
very often I have worn deep purple lips
in the past like once for a video once
so i will probably keep this but i will
very very rarely use it but i'm not
complaining because i'm sure people with
deep skin tones are really tired of
those pinky news we always get so
definitely excited for people with deep
skin tones not so excited for me the
beauty for real lip revival scrub I
really like lip scrub slip scrubs are
nice this one has a very mild hmm what
is that it's sweet it's very candy like
but I can't place the exact candy if you
know what candy this is you get a
brownie point if you can tell you what
candy the smells like
I can't place it I know it smells like
something specific but I can't place it
I can't place it as far as the grit on
this it's very fine grit but it
definitely has a scrub to it definitely
has a scrub I have not used it on my
lips yet but I am looking forward to
doing that next up we got a product from
makeup geek I think different people got
different products from makeup geek I
got an eyeliner pencil I have never
tried her eyeliner pencils I really want
to try more makeup geek products so I'm
very excited to try this eyeliner it is
a deep purple shade it seems to be very
very creamy and it seems to smudge out a
bit so I'm curious to try this and see
what I think and last up in this box we
got the butter london nail lacquer i
have used this I actually have worn it
twice now and I will save my full review
for next month but i did use this for
the holidays if you've seen any red on
my nails and swatches on either
instagram or youtube with a red nail
polish that was this so but i'll tell
you what i think next month overall it
seems like i'm gonna get my $21 worth
out of this box but we will see because
I was deceived in the past so I want to
thank you so much for watching this
