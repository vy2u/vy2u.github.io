the februari and March boxy charms now
it's been quite a while since I've
reviewed a boxy charm it's just been a
while so let's just not go into why it's
been a while let's just talk about the
box and soil I've had plenty of time to
try these I have not received my April
box yet so I can't speak to that but I
can speak to februari and March let's go
ahead and get into what I got and my
review of the products so for februari
our theme was kisses from boxy charm and
let's just go through through these
things one by one and I'll tell you how
good or terrible they were the first
thing is a modern minerals duo fiber
mini round brush and the retail price
for this is fifteen dollars and let me
show you how it looks up close and you
can see it is quite dense for a little
brush it packs a lot of bristles in
there with a frill don't have a big
crease area it's very thick so it will
get a lot of color in Turkish Air so
you're going to need a separate brush to
blend it out this is a really nice brush
for smoking out your outer corner
because you can get that really nice
circular motion it is tapered down a
little bit so it's going to get a good
amount of product on there but I have
found it is a bit difficult to work with
but it is very very soft and it is a fun
brush to work with I've never had a
brush exactly the shape before so I was
very very thankful to have it and it
says you are gorgeous which is always
nice to see you know even if it's an
animal object that's complimenting me
you know it's fine with me you know I'll
take it I'll take what I can get so this
is a win for me am I super excited do I
think it's worth fifteen dollars no but
I do think that i would pay ten dollars
for this it's it's a nice brush ok the
next thing everybody was really really
excited about in the unboxings which was
the facial mask by Mullen and sparrow
and the retail price for this I think
it's the full-size I'm not sure but it
says $15 this is a deluxe sample of a
sudden wealth the deluxe samples fifteen
dollars or if the full-size is fifteen
dollars but it is like a message in a
bottle kind of situation you've got your
little cork here I'm not going to open
it cuz I don't want to run the risk of
spilling it but there's a powder of the
clay powder in here I use this twice I
did
see any fantastic any kind of results
from just using it twice but what kind
of mass will give you results in just
two uses not not a whole lot some of
them will but this one didn't show any
difference now one thing to be very
careful about this is but when you run
it under water you do mix it with a
little bit of water and then you put on
your face it's very easy to add too much
water and the product will just kind of
dissolve in your hands which is not a
good thing so you gotta really just put
a little bit of water until you get just
the right consistency to kind of spread
it over your face and the directions for
this are use weekly by mixing a small
amount of water and apply moisten to
face allow to dry before gently rinsing
with warm water and I did enjoy using
this it wasn't magical it's very cute
it's cute to sit up in the bathroom you
know just as a little law you know
little toiletry that looks adorable but
i wouldn't pay fifteen dollars for this
i would pay eight for this i think that
it's very cute i think it's worth eight
next we have the ncl a nail lacquer in
heart attack and look how adorable this
was if you haven't seen this which
you probably have it's very cute so
there you are it is a clear base with
different colored Valentine's Day shade
little hearts floating i did use this
for Valentine's Day what I did to apply
it was I applied I took the brush out
and then I took tweezers and pulled the
hearts off of the brush and then applied
them exactly where I wanted them on my
nails I found that just taking this and
trying to brush the hearts onto my nails
did not work the hearts did not go where
I wanted them to you know this is
definitely one that is more for nail art
rather than just to paint all over your
nails but if you're willing to use a
pair of tweezers to apply them where you
want them this was really fun to use I'm
very thankful to have it it says that
this is worth sixteen dollars i would
pay 10 for it i think that it's a really
nice nail polish but i don't think it's
worth sixteen dollars next up was the
Jing I a velvet shine lip jewel it says
a Jing I is a noun meaning pure love and
this is in the shade pink abou and I
really really like this lip product I
liked it a lot it's moisturizing it's a
nice color it's not it's bright but it's
not obnoxiously bright and see the shade
there will swatch it's very creamy and
the color is beautiful is def
only a bright color so this is not going
to be for everyone this is kind of and
sometimes if when I'm feeling a little
crazy kind of lipstick this is not a
lipstick that I would wear to work or
whatever you call this with lip when
they call the lip jewel I would not wear
this to work this would be more of like
a date I'm going out you know to lunch
with the husband and the kids kind of
thing I would wear something like this
it is very fun I am thankful to have it
again it says that it's worth twenty two
dollars and I would not pay twenty two
dollars for this I would say this is
worth ten dollars i would pay ten for
this I feel like it's so moisturizing
it's such a beautiful color it's so
pigmented I do think that is worth that
price and finally the big bust of this
boxy charm was the mystery Beauty
solutions SI 2p complexion corrector and
this is a full-size and it says this is
worth thirty seven dollars if i pay
thirty seven dollars for this I would be
angry I would be so angry because I mean
you can tell right away I mean it's got
this little taped label on the top I
mean just very cheaply package and then
it's broken and I think everybody's was
broken it made a huge mess I when I did
use it it caked up on me increased I
wouldn't even pay a dollar for this I
think that I would rather pay a dollar
to dollars for an elf product or a wet
and wild product than this and I hate to
say that you know because I know someone
this is somebody's company but you know
my loyalty is my subscribers to be
completely honest with you and I would
not recommend this this is this is not a
good product at all and I feel like the
company needs to know it's not a good
product so they stop selling like this
they need to figure out how to make it
so it doesn't break and they need to
make it so it doesn't creak and kick up
on people it's just not a good product
especially if they're gonna ask you know
thirty seven dollars for it I just no no
so that's the februari boxy charm
overall was not super happy with this
box each arm at all I mean really and
truly I and four in comparison with
other baggage orange box charms my
favorite subscription forgot to mention
I do receive this as promotional
subscription but as you can see so far
that does not influence my review boxy
charm I mean we're like this they expect
me to tell it like it is so that's what
i'm doing here is telling it like it is
and I'll still love you back to Tromp
but i did not like this box i am
thankful
to have the ncoa nail polish I am
thankful to have the lip product I'm
thankful to have the brush but the other
two products to be completely honest I
could completely do without especially
this one this was a huge dud so a big
wawa on the februari boxy charm let's
move on to a march alright the March
boxy charm was a little bit better we
had lucky charm as our theme and let's
get into the products the first product
I was so happy to have which is the
Oscar blondie pronto dry shampoo spray
this was the very first dry shampoo that
I tried I heard about it on I was way
back when I used to watch casey homes i
used to watch her a lot and I think she
recommended this and I ended up really
really liking it a lot and I was very
thankful to her for recommending it it
doesn't have I can't remember what it
smell it it smells like hair spray um
but it definitely works very very well
you can see I just sprayed it on my hand
there's no white cast and I really love
this dry shampoo so saying that this is
the travel size is worth $11 I don't
know if the travel size is worth eleven
dollars but I would definitely pay ten
dollars for this it does have a lot of
product and it's got 1 point 2 ounces
let me see okay yeah it is double okay
so it's about half the size of a regular
dry shampoos I feel like it's such an
excellent dry shampoo Oscar blondie is
more higher and brand so I would pay
more for that moving on to the offres
eyeliner this is the offer eyeliner we
got I got it in Navy and it is gorgeous
there you go just a beautiful like
really I wouldn't call this a navy which
way to popping to be a Navy it looks
like an ocean blue rather than a navy
blue and it's it's beautiful it is a
little bit thick to go on so it's a
little hard to apply to the waterline
it's a lot easier to apply to the lash
line so i have used this on the lash
line and kind of pulled it up a little
bit on the outer corner and it looks
gorgeous that way it's long lasting not
in the water line but on the lash line
again so if you like that then
you will love this eyeliner I like offer
as a brand love their lip glosses
they're amazing and I overall I really
like offer products in general so
definitely a good one on this one it
says that the full price for this is
thirteen dollars and I would definitely
pay $13 for this I think that it is
definitely worth that price next is the
level X nail lacquer and I got this
yellow color which I don't mind yellow
nail polishes I have a bunch of yellow
nail polishes I use like use them for
nail art this is called lemon drop and
this is a very pastel II kind of yellow
it's not a bright neon yellow which I
really like the only thing my biggest
complaint about this is that it goes on
in three coats I really really like a
nail polish to going in one or two I
have so many the going on one or two
it's kind of my expectation at this
point so I was kind of bummed that this
was a three cook polish it's fine but
it's a three coat polish also it does go
on a little bit streaky so was not very
impressed with this particular polish I
haven't heard good things about this
brand but this polish I was not very
happy with it says this was worth $16 i
would pay six for it i would not pay 16
just because of the streakiness and the
three cotinus of it two more things we
have the tarte lipsurgence lip tint in
charmed says that this is twenty four
dollars and these definitely are $24
let's watch this next to the other one
and you can see well no it broke look
did you see that totally broke on man
let's see if I can roll it down and I
can't even roll it down I'm gonna have
to be gentle with this thing but you can
see it's a nice subtle wash of color and
it is a moisturizing product it has that
minty taste to it it's not plumping but
it's got a mint eNOS to its if you don't
like that you're not gonna like this
product on my lips I didn't like it as
much as I like it on my hand let's just
put it that way I don't know it just set
me off wrong maybe I'll just have to try
it a couple more times to see whether i
truly like it or not but one time I put
it on I ended up taking it off it was
just too much for that day maybe I need
to wear this like I said for this one
like on a Saturday going out to lunch
with my husband kind of thing but $24 I
really think these overall are
overpriced just in general so we'll say
15 for this even though I know tarts
expensive but i'm going to say 15 it is
more
rising though I do like it I don't think
it's any better than that other one that
we got in the other box in though it
start doesn't mean it's better you know
what I'm saying the last thing in here
was this provides nutri five skin-tight
126 universal tonic and this is a
full-size i use this a couple of times
I'm trying to use up the tonic that i
have so i did not use it a lot and you
can let me show you kind of it is a
little bit thicker for a tonic the one
that i have is a little more a little
more like water this has got a little
bit of an oily feeling to it even though
it says that its oil free drop a little
my hands I don't remember it's very
cooling to the touch it's very smooth it
has kind of a weird smell it's not a
funky smell like it's not a disturbing
smell but kind of like a clean grandma's
house kind of smell not lemon pledge
though like I don't know it smells like
my grandma's bathroom does that sound
bad I don't know but it does it reminds
me of my grandma's bathroom totally I
don't know how subscribe it because now
all I can think of is this smell my crap
what's better but it's honestly it's not
offensive it's just kind of an odd smell
it is an oil-free tonic infused with
antioxidant rich daisy flower extract
and higher hyaluronic acid to help
lighten and brighten skin so it says
lighten and brighten um I don't want to
be any lighter than I am I like my
lighter skin tone I don't want to be
lighter typically I self tan and the
summertime so I know that this might
even out my skin tone my skin doesn't
really need to be even out a whole lot
so I that the claim doesn't really
appeal to me personally but you know I
wasn't excited about this but I know
tonics are expensive and it says that
the full price for this is forty-eight
dollars i would say twenty twenty i
would pay for a ton of coz tonics are
kind of expensive but i don't think it's
worth more than 20 to me oh that's just
my opinion that's my opinion so overall
I really did like marches box I mean I
this isn't this is a I knew this is an
oldie but a goodie I love this stuff
it's awesome it's amazing was really
happy to rediscover it in this box
really really love the offer I line
are like the tort lipsurgence going to
give it another chance not really
impressed with the level X of lv.x low I
sing level X but the lv.x nail lacquer
not really impressed with that need to
have this I'm not excited about it but
I'm happy to have it and I will use it
and love it so definitely better on the
marsh box and the februari and I'm
hoping I've heard some good things about
the previews for the April box so I'm
very excited to get that one and review
