feeling about this I have been really
strict with myself about not watching
any box openings of boxes before I open
them because I feel like it influences
my review but one of my subscribers
spoil something for me today I found out
one of the things that's in my boxy
charm today and I cannot tell you how
excited I am to see whether this is true
or and I'm assuming it's true but I
don't know it to be true and I'm going
to find out in just a minute but I'm
telling you I have heart palpitations
thinking about the fact that that item
may be in this box boxycharm just real
quick is $21 a month they used to do a
bunch of drugstore items they have
recently pretty much stopped doing
drugstore items except for like SE and
nyx and ones that are a little more ones
that people rave about a little more
often that seemed a little less drug
story so boxycharm another thing I want
to tell you before I even get started as
I do get this as a promo box which means
I do not pay for it but I'm always very
very honest regardless of whether I get
it for free or not and I'm putting that
in there and if you've seen my past
boxycharm videos you know I call them
out if there's something in here that's
funky and wonky all I see is this it's
like Christmas I'm telling you okay it
says sweetest box and I'm not gonna read
it it actually has the products on the
back I'm not gonna read that because I'm
just too excited there is something
about eyelash she hands hide make
eyelashes so we must have some of those
in there I don't want to look oh isn't
that cute it says love you for
Valentine's Day isn't that adorable okay
it's like a foam little thing there okay
I'm gonna just rip the paper open I
cannot wait I'm gonna pull it out first
if I see it first it's coming out first
thing I'm excited about if I see it I
see it it is a full sized NARS nail
polish
seriously boxycharm are you kidding me
really thank you I've never owned a NARS
night nail posh because they're like how
much are they I'm gonna try to look
without looking at the other things
NARS nail polishes are $19 so this
almost pays for the box itself I'm so
excited to try this it is in the shade
storm bird
I'm gonna zoom you in so we can do the
drip test okay my hands are shaking I'm
so excited okay looks like probably mmm
pretty thin I'm gonna call this on a two
to three coat polish maybe even for
probably a three coat polish but still I
mean even if it's a three coat polish
it's an arse polish and I've never tried
an arse polish and it's got the same
NARS that rubbery this here this is the
end God created woman palette but it's
got that same rubberized top that I
really like that in the packaging it
just feels really nice but we'll see
about the quality of it I do my nails
payment or else they put it on now but
I'm really really excited about this
yeah thanks boxycharm okay I feel like
that's a commercial like what was that
commercial will is like Thank You Easter
bunny like thank you boxycharm so
excited okay so this is the eyelash she
will pull that out next and these I did
get some eyelashes in my Ipsy bag and
they were crazy like they're just not my
taste these I could wear these are a
little more reasonable looking and look
at this cute packaging it just pulls out
with this little drawer it's adorable
makes it feel more high-end you know I'm
saying
how much are these worth these are I
last sheet nine dollars from and it's
got directions on the back does it come
with glue it doesn't look like it comes
with clue glue when you pull out the
eyelashes that says be glamorous be
gorgeous be you thank you my last shape
but I will I will I'll Ashley thank you
for the inspiration so really excited to
try these now the next thing I see is
gorgeous as well what is up with this
packaging I mean they just
and then just I'm in love I'm in love in
February I'm in love this is gorgeous
this is by Pandora's box what is this
it's a misty pink blush it's got this
cute little flower here let's see how do
we open you hmm
I'm like getting chills like I'm
seriously I'm so excited look at that
look how beautiful oh my gosh you've got
to see this up close it's so pretty look
how beautiful this packaging is oh my
gosh I hopefully the blush is just as
good inside okay let's see soft feels a
little powdery just to touch a little
grainy let's do the swatch very
pigmented that's gonna be fun
let's do a breast watch this
the elf blush brush and I love it let's
just see how it does powder up quite a
bit but that's okay I don't care about
that as long as I tap it off let's tap
off the excess here um it looks like
it's gonna be nice once again a thank
you to christen game for that idea of a
brush watch beautiful very excited about
this blush as well oh my gosh boxycharm
I love you oh I see by Mirabella
and I do love Mirabelle products overall
this is my favorite thing I've ever
gotten from Mirabella this is a marbled
semi precious marble blush this thing's
gorgeous so I'm a big fan of the brand
this is a sweet velvet lip pencil I
don't typically use lip pencils but I
know that I should and maybe this will
get me into it let's see what it is
whoa it's not the lip pencil I was
thinking of I was thinking of with the
lip liner but it looks like this is more
of like a lip crayon yes cool and this
is in the shade it's a sweet velvet lip
pencil what shade are you it just says
sweet I don't know is that the color
sweet I guess so
I guess you're in the color sweet I just
shot in another video so I've got this
weird stuff here sorry about that
alright here we go whoa Pig mented whoa
dude I'll wrap that in the spring though
I think I noticed right away about this
is this creaminess of it I could just
feel how soft it was on my on my wrist
here doesn't feel sticky at all blends
out a little bit so it's probably
something I can shear out if it's a
little crazy I can share it out but very
excited about that
Wow boxycharm okay and the last thing is
another Mirabella item and then this is
a bronze eye definer I don't know what
that is we'll find out what that is
maybe an eyeliner okay it looks like an
eyeliner
smells like an eyeliner huh okay bronze
and there's the color there let's see
okay it's just a regular pencil which
I'm not as big of a fan of the wood
pencils because I feel like they dry out
a lot faster but we'll swatch it you
swatch it it's like swatch City over
here creamy creamy a little bit more
nice so if you like this would be really
good for a lower lash line I don't
think this is gonna look good on me for
upper lashline unless I did like a
thicker line and then did some black
really close to my lash line just to
give it a little more definition but I
think this would look creepy on me as
just a regular top eyeliner I think this
would look really nice on a blonde for a
top eyeliner but but yeah it will
definitely be used and puts a good use
and that is it for boxycharm so let's
look and see what our total value is
again $21 a month and we've got all
full-sized awesome products this month
so the eye definer is 19 from Mirabella
the eye lash hand-tied lashes are 9 the
pandora's blush is 18
the mayor Bella lips Lala lips is what
that's called
and that's 23 and then the Nortons nail
polish is 19 I can't even add that in my
head $88 is what I'm thinking I got I'll
put the calculation there good I'm not
as good at with math in my head but I
think it's $88 which is insane like this
may soon become my favorite subscription
over FC which is really hard to do but
for the second month in a row

butt like kicked it C's but up and down
