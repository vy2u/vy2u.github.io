can't officially make the face yet but
I'm feeling the face hello my friends
welcome to my January review of my box
e-tron box and showing you what we got
in the februari box unboxing ish thing
boxy charm is 21 dollars a month it is a
beauty subscription it is sent to me for
review but I promise you it does not
influence my review at all as you will
see I'm perfectly honest about my
reviews and boxy charm loves me for it
and that says a lot about boxy charm
that they have been sending me this for
years and they don't they actually
appreciate it when I tell them that I
don't like something which is amazing so
let's go ahead and talk about what we
got in Zia January box and I like this
format because I feel like it gives you
an idea even if you don't get boxee
charm it'll give you an idea of the
products and whether it's a product you
would want to invest in the first thing
that bit i'm going to talk about is
something that everybody was really
really excited and hyped up about and
this is the Coastal Scents revealed
smoky palette we've gotten every single
revealed palette from Coastal Scents in
a boxy charm this was actually sent to
me for review by Coastal Scents so I
actually passed along the one that was
in this box to my sister-in-law who
happens to love it I happen to love this
I will put a full my full review of this
with squatches next to the Urban Decay
smoky palette i will put that review
down below so you can check it all out
i'm going to give you a quick look-see
at the two of them next to each other
their top is the urban decay and the
bottom is revealed smoky so you can see
that there are definitely some similar
shades and there definitely are some
dupe shades in here is it an exact Duke
and the quality of this one is my
favorite one of all of the Coastal
Scents reveal palettes I feel like they
put the most love into this as far as
the quality of the shutters so very very
happy with this continue to use it
continue to love another thing that was
really really really good in this box
each arm that introduced me to tubing
mascaras was the blink mascara amplified
really love this when it first came out
I feel like it's starting to dry up on
me a little bit so I had recently done
last week I did a in my chat we tested
beauty hacks and I'm thinking about
maybe testing a beauty hack
this I'm a little scared because it is
still a good formula but I what we do is
we put saline solution inside the tube
and it kind of re wets it a little bit
so I might try that I'm scared I'm gonna
mess it up because what makes this
mascara magical is that when you have to
take it off at the end of the day all
you do is take warm water and the the
mascara just kind of falls off your face
I've heard some people don't like this
because they've had experience of it
falling in their eyes I've not had that
experience be a negative one I have had
a couple of flakes go in my eye but it's
not anything like getting anything else
in your eye you know like yet something
that's like that doesn't feel very
comfortable it's not I don't really like
that I want to get that out quickly but
it's not like oh my god I'm dying like I
actually got the it cosmetics mascara in
my eye once and it was so bad my eyes
turned red it was horrible it was
terrible this was not the same
experience this was just more of an
annoyance getting in my eye than
something that was painful so that
didn't really bother me a whole lot but
the removal of it I've got this thing
now now that I'm in my mid to late 30s
of rubbing my eyes very hard so I feel
like this is like one of those things
worth like a spa in a mascara you know
you take your hot water and you just put
it on your face and the mascara just
kind of melts off and it's like ah you
know at the end of the day it's very
very nice so really really like this my
only thing was is that as it got a
little older it did start to dry out a
bit and I don't feel like the effect of
it the lengthening and volumizing was as
good as it got older but I'm gonna try
to doctor it up and see how it goes but
for the price i feel like i shouldn't
have to dr. it feel like it should just
be awesome on its own so i'm really
interested in trying some of the
drugstore tubing mascaras of her
L'Oreal's got a really good one so i'm
gonna definitely be exploring tubing
mascaras now that I've discovered this
that was really long let's move on this
one won't take as long this is the star
looks long-wear eyeliner pen and this is
the black one this is a felt tip marker
tip and it is blackity black black black
which is wonderful my only complaint
about this is the same complaint I have
about the Maybelline one in that when
you do a wing if you accidentally rub
the side of your eye forget it it's all
over the all of your face I'll this
lasted about an hour at work before my
friend Marilyn came up to me she was
like Jan you've got
all over the side of your face and I was
like oh my gosh are you serious so I was
really thankful she said something so I
went to the bathroom and I had to wait
both my wings off were also be flying
crooked you know you don't really want
that so I had to wipe both my wings off
and it was just kind of annoying but
that's my only complaint if you don't
plan on doing a wing this is wonderful
because I mean who goes like this to
their eyes in the middle of the day
hopefully nobody because you're hurting
your eyes and you're going to mess up
your makeup but yes where am I going
with that I I think you know where I'm
going basically I like it except for the
rubbing off the sides there we go done
with that Jen shut up I'm like rambling
today oh my god then the last thing in
this box was the royal and langnickel
brush set specifically for boxy charm
they have the bx 80 the bx 95 and the bx
90 in here I really liked every single
one of these brushes I very much enjoyed
using them this is kind of a standard I
shadow brush so this is for packing on
color I really like how thin the handles
are it just feels good it just feels
nice to have a nice thin handle on this
one this one here is for detailing up in
the crease open new crews we go up in
the crease with that one so it's really
nice for detailing I like the very fine
point on there the tapir goes down
pretty well so it picks up quite a bit
of product which is very nice but it
sometimes picks up a little too much
product and that's where this one comes
in this is a blending brush so you take
the bigger one and you use that to kind
of blend out your crease and they all
work very very well they all feel very
synthetic but they don't feel crispy or
scratchy they don't feel especially soft
either they're just kind of mid-range
effective brushes what I purchase more
of these probably not because they don't
stand up stand out as being amazing but
are they effective yes and a good
brushes yes there's not amazing brushes
and that's it for the January box now
let's get into februari because this was
a really good box I think this was worth
well over $21 this box made me super
happy I'm a little nervous about
februari now I'm just gonna roll through
this real quick because girlfriend I
haven't tried everything in here yet but
there's gonna be a review next month's
make sure you subscribe so you don't
miss the review alright so the first
thing in here is the freeze 27
anti-aging serum it
the sample size and it's $58 I did hear
that this sample size is $58 that the
full size is over a hundred dollars I
haven't used it yet so I can't make I
can't officially make the face yet but
I'm feeling the face not sure about that
next up I've heard this is very very
nice someone told me they got this in
like a fab fit fun box or something like
that and they said that it was wonderful
this is the sponge l have you seen my
heart on a string body wash infused
buffer and polish I haven't used it yet
because I wanted to be pretty for the
video next time you see this it will be
all messy and nasty because I will have
used it so it looks very cute I'm
excited to try it next is this perfume
and this is by real tree and it's very
floral but definitely has a fruity kind
of missed it um but you know I'm not the
biggest fan of this so far as far as the
overall sense I thought I really liked
it when I first tried it but the more I
smell it the less I like it also it's
got this cheesy little sticker on there
which is you know it's fine but hope
it's not expensive how much does it cost
realtree you cost 1299 okay that's fair
enough fair enough so we'll test that a
little bit more so I have more review
for you next month alright next a beauty
for real for real though this is in
coral crush and high beam there's a
highlight on one side there is a blush
on the other and I'll give you a full
review next month on that that's the
thing i want to give you a nice review
on is the ofra banana powder I've never
used a banana powder before this one
I've used it now twice I want to use it
more they also say you can use this as a
matte yellow eyeshadow but I one thing I
can say is I really like this little
packaging with the little law the little
spongy around the outside I think that's
pretty smart of ophir to do that it
keeps it in place keeps it nice and
cushion just really smart to do that and
I'm sure that costs more so just good on
you ofra for adding that a little extra
love to the packages and then the last
thing in here is something that
definitely doesn't make me do super
excited it's a phase mass
big fan of facemask where did it go why
isn't it in here what where did it go
what did I do with this is the facemask
that's what it looks like it says them
look as good as you are miss amazing
sensitive dry skin moisturizing mask
boxy charm limited edition says cleanse
your face remove your makeup patch of
skin dry remove the mask from the
package unfold math place it on your
face remove the plastic cover leaving
the sheet mask on your face and leave it
on put your feet up for 10 minutes you
deserve it remove the mask please do not
wash off after using so I am not so
excited to try that because sheet masks
gross me out but i will try it for the
good of the channel now as far as value
of the februari box so far I know that
it's worth the value monetarily but I
expect boxy charm to like blow me out of
the water you know Coastal Scents
revealed smoky palette and an eyeliner
and an amazing mascara and all this
amazing stuff I feel like they threw six
products in here for a reason because
they knew if they'd just put five we
would have been like so now they've put
the six in so we're kind of like you
know I definitely it's a more positive
experience with six but is there
anything in here that I'm super uber
excited about not really I think the
thing that most excited about is the
blush and highlighter duo but everything
else is just kind of we'll see but final
