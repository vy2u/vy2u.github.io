you this month's box a charm
I seriously if you've seen my videos
this week you have seen I had a dud new
Beauty test tube
I had a dud Birchbox I had a dud empty
bag so I am praying and hoping to the
subscription box guys the box each arm
is gonna pull through it because this is
my last subscription box for the month
and it has not been good my friends it
has not been good so crossing my fingers
let's get into boxycharm tell you a
little bit that boxycharm box each arm
is $21 a month and they are slightly
changing things that used to give a lot
of drugs for full-size items now they
are moving toward more higher-end
full-size items and also some deluxe
sample size I have noticed that they've
removed the drugstore brands
except for NYX and Essie and then
they've replaced them with like be a
bombshell and model CO and some of the
other ones that we see in beauty boxes
sometimes I'm curious to see what is in
this because they are in a state of
transition and I would love to see where
they took it this month but I am excited
about the direction that boxycharm is
going in though I do really love those
drugstore items that they were including
I felt like you know this is definitely
in my opinion the way for boxycharm to
go in the more full-sized higher-end
samples I think people really love that
when they're not as easily accessible as
going straight to the drugstore and
getting them and also I want you know I
do get this as a promo box meaning that
I don't pay for it but I'm always very
very honest about what comes in here
sometimes to my you know I feel kind of
bad because they send it to me for free
and sometimes I'm like really boxy
charlie but I want to be honest with you
and I told them in the beginning I was
gonna be honest so enough about that
let's find out within this box so I'm
not gonna look at this I'm not gonna
look but on the other side says cheers
to a new year and then this is how it
comes with the black paper and the box
of truck sticker and let's see
okay okay so we've got gold and black
worms looks like we've got some really
good stuff in here from what I can see
so far
Oh model Co here we go gel eyeliner from
model Co with a built in built brush and
it's black that's cool my black
eyeliners I had one from like a beauty
that I got an Ipsy bag that I loved I
had a Bobbi Brown one that I loved and
they're both drying out so I'm excited
to get a new one of these
oh the brush just came out so there's
the brush hold on a minute get out of
box look there we go I got it it was
stuck in there but yeah I mean it looks
really super small and I wonder if this
is full-size but I definitely want to
try this like right now I can't wait
okay so this brush is a little too big
for me I don't and unless I turn it on
the side maybe it'll work but I don't
think I'm gonna use this brush okay but
let's let's use the brush anyway just to
see how thin of a line I can get okay
there was that Kaelyn company with it
Kaelyn then if see that had a brush like
this had this whole set up with the
little brush on the top all right let's
see if I can get a thin line probably
this is I can't see what I'm doing I'm
showing y'all but I can't see what I'm
doing mm yeah that actually made a
pretty thin line it's a little wonky but
there you go this is actually really
nice it's very creamy
I love gel eyeliners from my waterline I
feel like that they apply really well on
my waterline overall so I have to keep
you posted on this excited about this
because especially since I really needed
it
okay so one way yeah okay now we have
this ofra long lasting liquid lipstick
and Angela's like Los Angeles I've
gotten some lip glosses from them in the
little tubes and I really like them they
have that mint eNOS to them let's try
this out I don't big mented it's like a
nudie ooh oh it smells good it smells
like cake oh I want cake on my lips
let's see I'll put it over this this is
a Revlon bomb stain and adore Holly
Holly lighting that up nicely you guys
think of that let's do Matt
I changed it to an actually a really
pretty color and totally change the
color 200 I'm happy but that it's a
little bit on the frosty side a little
tiny bit but I think it looks nice you
guys like it I love that I'm really
happy about that so 2 - 4 - all right
here we go
be a bombshell birthday suit what is
this I shadow
cool so I'm assuming this is a nude
color yes it is cute all this good stuff
ok lay there swash let me zoom in again
keep zooming you zoom in young so
there's a swatch of birthday suit and
we'll put that here can we see that I
can't see it all right second swatch my
friends there we go that's what I'm
talking about all right
I can't see it I mean we wanted to be
naked if its birthday see we want to be
able to see it ok it definitely feels
really creamy but it matches my skin
tone like perfectly but I bet this would
be gorgeous on somebody with a darker
skin tone but I think it's gonna work
it's just I mean it feels very creamy it
doesn't feel powdery just perfectly
matches my skin tone so it's really hard
to tell I'm gonna have to play with that
spa ritual we've gotten this is a third
nail polish I've got from spy ritual and
I have loved the other two that we got
this one is in flower child oh it's like
a mommy with some gold and then some
gold shimmer
alright so that's what that looks like
and let's go ahead and do it little drip
test so we can see the thickness of it
mmm looks like it's gonna be either a 2
or a 3 cup polish I think this is gonna
be good I will let you know this is a
really nice wintry fall color so excited
to try this there's something else in
here and there's more in here pocket
charms st. my subscription boxes for
this month I'm telling you oh it's just
one more thing that's ok that's alright

alright here we go
this is reveal and reveal re ve I ll e
warm vanilla sugar brown sugar a body
polish cool oh my gosh
that's not so good again smelling like
cupcakes cake frosting ha smell
mmm that smells good ah feels very sandy
on the top you can see the texture let
me show you the texture so it's a very
gritty out if you can hear that but
that's what a body polish is supposed to
be oh my goodness excited about that
this is going straight into my bathroom
there isn't a single thing in this box
each arm that I'm not excited about I'm
excited about everything in here and
boxycharm does guarantee that they will
have at least 2 times the value of the
box so at least 42 dollars of products
in the box and they definitely did that
this month I mean this is just five
products and they're all I'm excited
about all of them would you be excited
about all these because I'm excited
about all these oh I got chills they're
multiplyin oh they've got all the prices
on the back now I don't know if they had
that before but let me add this up
