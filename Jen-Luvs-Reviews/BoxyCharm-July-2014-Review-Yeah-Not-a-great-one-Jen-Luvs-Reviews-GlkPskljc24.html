charm I know I am super late on this one
I went on vacation and it set me back a
lot of days so I'm a little bit behind
so let's just go ahead and jump right
into what I got in my box each arm and
boxy charm is 21 dollars a month and it
is my favorite subscription because it
is always packed full of some
awesomeness it's rare that i am not
happy with a boxy charm new july box is
American beautiful and there's products
on the back we got one two three four
five full-size products this month for
$21 which is amazing okay first thing
I'm seeing it the pur Lisse the SPF 30
sunscreen essential daily moisturizer I
can always use another moisturizer I
think we got a full-size pur Lisse
another time i'm pretty sure these are
really expensive yeah $55 for this bad
boy yeah I've never tried I don't think
this particular one that SPF 30
sunscreen but this will definitely be
used and loved next I see a Lauren B
beauty but Beverly Hills nail couture
nail polish and this is in a bright red
and let's do a little drip test here ooh
that looks thick so this I'm calling on
a one to two coat polish I do have a
stupid amount of red nail polish but I
have nothing by Lauren B so I'm excited
to try that next I'm pulling out
bellapierre bellapierre gold and brown
mineral eyeshadow i believe let's say is
it a mineral eyeshadow i'm assuming
shimmer powder news excuse the old
squatchy but i'm too lazy to take
all right let's watch it here ooh
shimmering goodness that'll be a nice
all over lid color let's do a brush
swatch nice it looks like this will be
nice over maybe a blur over a white base
it's not super dense in the pigmentation
gives a nice shimmer but it's not going
to give an solid all over lid color
going to need like a NYX jumbo pencil in
milk or something and that would go over
top this might be nice the top matte
shadow if you feel like you want to go
shemer but not really a good standalone
coat and based on the name that might be
its purpose it says that it is a shimmer
powder not an eyeshadow so I'm assuming
that this is that this this isn't
supposed to be a standalone shadow so
okay I wish it was a stable own shadow
but that's okay i am happy to have it
next I see appeal cosmetics which I've
never heard of which means that i'll
probably be seeing some appeal cosmetics
and some subscription boxes coming up
very soon let's see what it is what are
you appeal cosmetics looks like you are
a lipstick in a baby pink that is a
straight-up color that all know about
doesn't look oh yeah it's a blue tone
pink you just saw me swatch it and I'm
gonna give it away so if you were
interested in this I know I just watched
it but if you're still interested in
even though i swatched it i'm going to
be giving it away down below it is a
blue tone pink and the color is not for
me you're going to put a comment down
below that you're interested in lipstick
and i will mail it to one of you i'll
pick up our random.org about 24 hours
after this video goes lied and notify
the winner so through YouTube messaging
also a comment below and the purse the
winners comment and let you know that
you want so you want that comment below
it does seem very creamy
lens out pretty nicely just the color is
just not for me and then the last thing
in here is a bit another bellapierre and
this is a lip liner and truly red i was
just watching i think it was on safaris
youtube channel of the smashbox video
about lip liner and why they're
important blah blah blah i don't really
wear a lip liner but i would like to try
wearing some this is a deep red this
will be nice for fall this is really
deep and it's a wood pencil which i'm
not really the biggest fan of
apprentices they tend to dry things out
hmmm have to play with this and see I
don't know should I give this away to
not excited about this either okay we'll
give this away too if you're interested
in the lip liner you can comment down
below either for the lipstick the lip
liner or both and i'll give away both
because this is just I mean it's just a
deep deep red color and I'm never going
to wear this thing ever in life never
going to wear it so I'm gonna pass on to
one of you so I mean I think for the
right person this would have been a
great box for me personally it wasn't a
great box but that's just because of my
personal preference on the shades this
is something I have so many of these
that I don't really need this but i will
use it and it is a really nice product
I'd like the pur Lisse products that
have gotten before the lip liner colors
just not for me and I'm like wood
pencils so I'm going to pass that along
lipstick color just wasn't for me
formula seems nice the only reason why
I'm keeping this is because I don't have
any by Lauren B and I just want to try
this formula and then the bellapierre
wasn't a super pigmented eyeshadow but i
will put some love into this and i will
use it a little bit of a wawa on the
boxy charm this month but it was
seriously just personal preference i
don't blame boxed rapport I feel like
they put a lot of really good high value
products in here and if I didn't have
such a stupid about a makeup I'm sure
that I would have liked it more or if I
was more adventurous in trying these
colors of lipstick and of course we have
the worms that i will keep
then repackage if you want to get away
from me these could be at the bottom of
your baggage because I keep them and I
reuse them and recycle them because
that's a good thing to do but thank you
so much about you trapper sentence me I
all we appreciate it I do it just wasn't
was it my favorite this much just a
personal thing so thank you so much for
