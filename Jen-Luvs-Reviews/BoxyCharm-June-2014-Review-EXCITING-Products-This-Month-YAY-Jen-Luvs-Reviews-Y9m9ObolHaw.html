requests to do my boxycharm for this
month and I'm so happy to finally be
bringing it to you now I'm not sure if
you know this but if you don't I just
recently in the past couple of months
started finally an Instagram I know I
know everyone has an Instagram I decided
to get Instagram and I'm loving my
Instagram but I'm also hating my
Instagram because people on Instagram
they like to post boilers of things that
I don't want to know like what's in the
box each arm so I kind of already know
what's in here and I'm totally bummed
out about it but I don't know exactly
what's in mine and it'll still be really
nice to be able to see that I actually
got the things that I saw on Instagram
because oh my goodness I saw some
amazing things but let's go ahead and
get into this this is the June boxycharm
and boxy Trump is $21 per month and you
get lots of full-size and it's the
deluxe sample size beauty products and
it's a monthly thing the billing is
reoccurring you can cancel at any time
and only ships to the US unfortunately
hopefully as their company grows they'll
be able to ship to other places but as
of now it is just the US only
subscription so let's find out what is
in this now that those technicalities
are over all right so I open up my
boxycharm and it says bridal beauty and
June is the month for wedding is that
another that and then all the products
are on the back and I'm not going to
look at that I just watched a video by a
Vanessa that is rad and she was like
number one rule of box opening is you
don't look at the back of your card so
Vanessa I'm not looking at the back of
the card first thing I see is chart
high-performance Naturals 20% off your
purchase on tart comm and the code is
boxycharm 14 and it's valid from July
7th to July 18th of 2014 so you can feel
free to use this if you like one thing I
forgot to mention is I do get boxycharm
as a promotional subscription as I have
since there are second boxycharm but
that never influences my review the fact
that I do get this as a promotional box
if you look back there's definitely been
some critiques of the boxycharm I'm
classy always smart enough to know
whether the products stink or not next
card is he is friendly I'm a scare
you will love or giving you a special
chance to try it and it's the Revlon
this bambam Revlon bold lacquer by grow
luscious I always wonder where do they
come up with grow lush is grown wash
just like another brand or why do they
do that
is it a line like buy grow luscious what
does that even mean if you worked at
Revlon if you could explain that to me I
would appreciate that because that is
very very strange to me this is in the
blackest black and it is a lengthen
Volume Mascara now I do have a
ridiculous amount of mascaras open right
now but I'll show you the packaging so
you can see what the brush looks like so
supposedly that's what the brush looks
like right there and in a month or so I
will have be done with a couple of
mascaras and I will probably open this
because all I have right now open are
high-end mascaras and I really need to
open a drugstore mascara so that shoud
be good and then they gave us a $1 off
any Revlon mascara coupon sweet eye I
spent a while since I saw these on
Instagram and I'm very excited to Reena
Tarantino I've always been interested in
trying her products I was hoping to get
I think there was a blush available in
though Jun wants of a box and I did not
get that so I was really sad so now I
get to try some Tarina Tarantino
products and this is a I dream a
highlight hyper liner in cute robot
there we go okay so it's bu let us watch
okay so let's swatch it feels very
creamy not is that pigmented yeah it's
pigmented I just had to not do it on to
the side but yeah that looks nice just a
dark blue liner
okay the pencil does not feel like wood
I don't know if that's wood or not or
some kind of synthetic it's like a
synthetic wood I don't know which
hopefully will make it last longer
because I found that what pencil it's
not sometimes seep the moisture out of
the actual pencil so excited to try this
this is a waterproof eye pencil so we
will be trying that out since it's
summertime it's nice to have waterproof
stuff for sweat and pools and things of
that nature because we are on this
target you know a tarantino can't
we'll open up the iDream Hyperlite under
eye brightener now and lets us see what
this is I have never heard of this
product except for on Instagram okay so
it's one of these kinds of dealios and
let's roll it up crackle crackle so
that's that spreads very uh very nicely
it's very soft and smooth okay it does
feel thicker than I expected
interesting and it's got a peach tone to
it which I think I would prefer I don't
know let me see this is my current
favorite under eye brightener right now
and it's by yves pearl and that is what
that looks like it's a perfect salmon
colored highlight and let me show you
what that looks like next to it so there
is the terri Tarina Tarantino and there
is the Yves pearl and you can see this
is Pinker than that that's definitely
more salmon I was curious just to
compare the Terina Tarantino one is
definitely Pinker there is a level of
stickiness to the Terina Tarantino not
sticky but like it's almost sticky it's
like on the edge of sticky what we will
try this and hopefully it works very
very nicely so it's very excited to try
that these are very interesting these
are actually a company called strange
beautiful and I've got two of these
polishes before and I absolutely love
them they were one Cooke polishes just
absolutely gorgeous they look almost
like julep polishes but the formula I
would say is gazillion times more
amazing than most polishes that I have
tried even by julep these are these are
purposefully not named polishes they
have no names they have no numbers and
they are very difficult to come by I
want to say you can only buy them in
their stores or something crazy like
it's weird I will put any information
that these polishes down below because
if you can get your hands on these these
things are amazing at least the ones we
got last time were let me check do like
a little drip just oh yeah I mean just
thick I mean you can just tell this
stuff is no stinkin
and the colors are beautiful oh my gosh
I'm so excited about these it looks like
this color is a little less opaque than
this color but so excited have more
polishes from strange beautiful and then
the last thing in here is a full-size
Tarte cheek stain and blushing bride and
I do love her cheek stains I have one
one two one I have one it's the old
packaging and I do really like it a lot
I don't feel like it's super pigmented
but I do like it let me see if this
one's a little more pigmented than the
other one whoo look at that pretty
that's kind of rub that in a little bit
so you can see what that will look like
on ooh excited about that but one thing
if you are not used to using cream
blushes and you've got this one thing
you really want to make sure you do is
you put this on before you put your
powder on so you put on your foundation
then you put this on then you powder
over top it stays on a lot better that
way another thing you can do is you can
layer your blush so your blush lasts
longer so you put on your foundation you
put on your cream blush you put on your
powder then you put on a little bit of a
powder blush you know you don't want to
make it look like a clown of course but
you can kind of layer it so that you
know you do a little bit of this a
little bit of powder blush and your
blush lasts a lot longer just a little
tip really SuperDuper excited about this
and for $21 I mean I don't know how
boxycharm is doing this I don't know how
they're able to provide these things and
still make a profit I don't get it I I'm
so happy for them because they're really
super nice people over there they start
off with a lot of drugstore stuff and
then they kind of bumped it up to doing
more high-end stuff I mean this is just
a ridiculous box amazing boxycharm so
but just so you guys know usually this
is kind of the rule for all subscription
boxes that I've ever tried is when you
get an amazing box chances are the next
box is not going to be quite as amazing
but the way that box each arm has been
there's only been one month and that was
last month that I wasn't super excited
about since January so I mean you always
feel like I get twenty one dollars worth
of products out of box each arm and if
you watch other reviews they will
probably tell you the exact same thing I
mean boxycharm is definitely one
best subscription boxes out there it is
my current personal favorite and I
highly recommend that you check it out
if you enjoy getting a surprise in the
mail if you enjoy primarily makeup
products I think that you would really
like boxycharm
I've recommended it to personal friends
I pretty much recommend it to everybody
so yeah that's boxycharm I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
you give it a thumbs up and make sure
you subscribe if you're not already
subscribed hi it's nice to meet you
hopefully you'll stick around and
hopefully I will see you in a video very
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
