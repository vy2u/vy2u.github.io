review of boxycharm oh my goodness this
school year totally kicked my butt oh my
goodness but it's over and now I can get
back to doing more box reviews and other
makeup reviews and I'm so excited to be
back on a regular filming editing
schedule thank goodness alright so I'm
Way behind on my boxy charms I want to
show you what I got over the past three
months
I have April May and June here and I
reviews for everything and I am so
excited to share this stuff with you so
let's go ahead and get started and start
with April actually before I get started
just to let you know I do receive this
as a promotional subscription but that
does not influence my review at all boxy
and charm and I are like this they know
that I review things honest and they
appreciate me for it and that is one
reason why I love me some boxy charm
other than that is $21 a month and you
always get full-size items and it's just
it's an amazing subscription either I
don't know how they do it but they do it
and it's amazing so let's go ahead and
start with the April box and I will give
you my review on all of those products
this is also valuable if you want to go
out and purchase these products you'll
know you know how good they are
April's theme was April bloom and we're
gonna go ahead and start this video off
with a giveaway yes a giveaway because
it came with the revealed 2 palette
which I already own and I don't need a
second one will be able to I like it I
don't love it and I'll be honest with
you it's a good palette it's got a lot
of shades in it you just kind of have to
find the ones that are good and stick
with the ones that are good I would say
about 1/2 to 3/4 of the palette have
really nice shadows the other quarter to
have is like but I will be doing this
for giveaway I know a lot of people
really love this palette and I will do
the giveaway rules and everything down
at the end of the video you can always
fast forward but I just want to spend
too much time on that right now because
I want to do product reviews so that was
in the April box of course I wasn't too
excited to see it just because I already
have it but it is a pretty good product
especially for a $21 box that takes care
of the value of the entire box next up I
got the offer a powder this is also
going to be going in the giveaway this
is not a product for me it's just a very
shimmer
powder this one is called pink sapphire
it's kind of messy just kind of how
glittery and shiny that is let me close
this up and swatch it on the back of my
hands
I haven't dug into the actual product
I've just kind of swatched on the lid a
bit but I'm sorry there's already a
swatch there but yeah I mean it's just
basically it's like a kind of like a
fine glitter
yeah that's watching it come out very
good but yeah it's a fine glitter so if
you win the giveaway and you're
interested in this you can have this as
well and if not I'll just save it for
somebody else okay next up in here is
actually another thing I'm gonna be
giving away I know this is terrible but
this is actually a really good product
this is the Harvey Prince Hello
rollerball I have not opened this
because I already own quite a few Harvey
Prince products for the hollow scent I
own a full-size rollerball and I think I
own a smaller one as well I really love
this perfume it smells fantastic it
doesn't say what the description of this
scent is but I will put that down below
as far as what they say the notes are it
really is a very nice perfume but again
I already own it so I'm gonna go ahead
and give this for giveaway as well it
does have a typical kind of last wow
there goes my earring nice Jen nice
let's go ahead and put the earring back
in because who wants a lopsided eared
person doing a review here was it
falling out the whole time did I just
miss it and it just finally just lost it
oh my goodness
can I even put my earring back in I've
been putting earrings in since
kindergarten so again with that I am
going to be giving this away as well not
because it's bad just because I already
own this set next up was the cool way
smoothing lotion smooth manageable
healthy hair with no frizz styling
products I did find this helpful and
useful it is a nice product so it comes
out like a drippy kind of lotion there
it's kind of more I don't know it's just
wet wet it's got a relatively strong
fruity scent to it and it does kind of
help my frizz a little bit my hair is
going a little crazy it's very humid
right now you can use this on damp or
dry hair to kind of calm down your frizz
I think I'm doing all right right now
can I do some
for his action I don't know I need to
get my hair cut really bad oh I don't
know let's put some men let's see what
happens okay let's call on this side
down see what happens see there you go
let's go on the other side
do I look calmer do I look less frizzy
yeah I think I do it's a nice product I
mean I in general I like cool whey
products um I had a shampoo buy them
that I really liked do I feel like this
is a must-have I don't know I guess it
just depends on how frizzy your hair is
it is a very very nice product you know
I have one thing I did notice about this
is the effects of it don't last all day
the last you a few hours without the
whole frizziness happening but it's a
nice product and then the last thing
that we got in this is this vincent
longo
eyeliner and i really like this eyeliner
it's double engine it looks a like a DS
and this one has two shades in golden
moss and brown or a Fela or a Fela let's
go ahead and swatch
okay so there's like the mossy kind of
color there and you can see it's a wood
pencil and then this one here there's
the brown and one thing that I really
like doing with these is doing kind of
an ombre where I'll put like brown on
the outer corner here and then I'll do a
little bit of green in the middle kind
of fading out to the edge and then I'll
put like a nude kind of color or a white
here to kind of you know give it that
gradient really cool effect I really
like it a lot it's very creamy to go on
it stays in the waterline for a short
period of time and then it fades but it
does stay on the lash line very very
nicely just don't expect it to stay in
the waterline forever but I really
really really like this eyeliner a lot
so overall for boxycharm for April I
really really like this box I think it
was a fantastic deal especially if you
didn't own any of the products before
this eyeliner is fab the cool way hair
stuff is good the reveal too is also a
really good product the the Harvey
prints perfume is very good and then the
Ofra this is definitely gonna be a
personal preference thing I feel like
this is probably the least exciting in
there just because I don't think a lot
of people love this much shimmer and
this is really really really sparkly
there was another offer product that
some people got that I wished that I had
but I camera what it was but this was
the one that I got I was calling me but
definitely definitely definitely well
over $21 subscription price on this one
moving on to maze bumps to the theme for
the May box was bold and beautiful but
overall I really like this box as well
this box is fantastic one mess and all
the rest were hits the first thing in
here is a model Co bronzer and I really
love model Co blushes and bronzers they
are very very very pigmented stay on a
really long time but very easy to go to
clown face so you got to be really
careful you got to make sure you're
using a fluffy enough brush if you're
not used to using that much color this
bronzer does have some sparkle in it so
be aware if you um
if you wanted to order this one this one
is the shimmer bronzing powder and I'll
swatch over here for you okay and that's
what that oh my goodness
flake City over here that's what that
looks like with a finger swatch I don't
feel like the gold shimmer that's in
here transfers as much to the cheek as
it looks like in the pan but you see how
this one's very very subtle compared to
this this is much more subtle you can
build it the other thing is a lot of
powder kicks up with this product so
just be aware of that but you see how it
builds a bit and you can even get it to
build up further especially if you have
a fair skin tone than mine of course
this isn't going to be for people with
skin tones that are deeper than this but
for me I really really like this bronzer
I don't feel like the shimmer is
obnoxious it's a nice subtle shimmer and
I like it a lot of course not for
contouring because of the warmth but are
really nice sun kissed glow bronzer next
we'll talk about my least favorite
product in here but not for the sake of
packaging because the packaging is just
absolutely gorgeous it's almost like
it's in this little cage and this is
called the lip bar lipstick and this is
a full-size of course and says it's got
vitamin E shea butter avocado oil for
moisturizing and all of that but the
shade I just say my shade girlfriend I
just named my shade so this is gonna go
in the giveaway as well I have not
swatched this I have not put it on this
is going in the giveaway so if you like
this you can have this
and as with all of my giveaways if you
win something that you don't like I'd be
happy to replace it with something else
just give me you know just let me know
you don't like something and we'll work
something out I'll tell you the similar
products that I have in my collection
and we'll work something out but this is
also going into the giveaway because
it's just not my shade all right moving
on to another one of my favorite
favorite favorite products this is the
body Aughra fille Brown trio and I am
wearing this today I have worn this
pretty much every day since I've got it
and I'm not even kidding it's fantastic
I use the darkest shade here and it also
came as another product in here with
this brow brush it's just a flat eyebrow
brush and it's got the spoolie on the
other side it does have some stray hairs
there that I don't particularly like I'm
not super impressed with this brush but
it works
I can use it the darkest shade of course
is best for me I've used this as a brow
bone highlight I've also used this as a
cream colored eyeshadow for blending
purposes and I've really been enjoying
this I haven't been using this one quite
as much but this brow product does last
all day long and I really really like it
a lot it says that this is $19 and I
would honestly pay $19 for this this is
a fantastic brow product I think it's
just as good as the products that I've
gotten from Sephora the honest Asya
products that I've used and then the
last thing in here I will put a picture
of it here was a Lauren B nail polish
which I misplace it's like are you
kidding me I'm trying to shoot a video
and I can't find the nail polish but I
can report that I love Lauren B nail
polishes this nail polish went on in one
thick coat or two thin coats I'm gonna
copy Karina kaboom and how she reviews
nail polishes because I love it
but yeah one thick coat two thin coats
dries glossy it's just a beautiful nail
polish shipping time was pretty typical
for me which is about two to three days
before the first chip and I really
really love these polishes and I love
the color and I was really happy to have
it so value on this box again I felt
like you bought to try and blew it out
of the water with this one absolutely
love this the model Co bronzer is a huge
win for me I really liked it a lot the
lip bar lipstick if it had been a
different shade I would have tried it
but I wanted to say but forgive away for
you so I did not try that product the
brows I mean this brow product is
phenomenal this to me just by itself is
worth the value of the box Allah
with the brush I think the brush was
fantastic I really really enjoy this
this bully of course is a spooly and
could always use a spoolie course the
nail polish I really really loved but
I've misplaced it hopefully I find it at
some point so definite win on the May
box let's move on to June
alright I've had of course this one the
least amount of time but I can still
give you a review of the products inside
that I've tried so far the first one is
the nail polish by N CLA I am wearing
that today I've had it on for about
three days and I really really like it a
lot on the what's up in makeup app a lot
of people were trying this on and really
liking it
it does go on streaky in the first coat
second coat does remain a bit streaky
but if you get a third coat on there
it's not so bad but just be prepared
that this nail polishes is a little bit
of work it is the nudes and this is
volume four is the shade and I was
really happy to get this what do the
makeup apps should be available for
Android middle of July because I know
people are gonna ask so hopefully middle
of July cross your fingers for us
alright and then the next thing I was
very excited about is this SL or
chlorophyll lifting mask I had tried a
sample of this in a beauty box v and
absolutely loved it so it was really
really excited to get this I have not
used this one yet but I have used this
product before it is the green gel
consistency it is chlorophyll so I guess
that's why it's green it has a
eucalyptus smell to it which is very
calming and refreshing and it is very
enjoyable to use as far as seeing visual
effects from using this mask I didn't
see any but that doesn't mean enough no
good things are happening with this and
it is a ridiculously expensive product
well not for skincare it's $38 so very
very excited to have this as this is a
product that I knew I enjoyed when I as
soon as I opened it up the bellapierre
cosmetics Kabuki brush it's a really
nice brush one thing I like about this
is that it's small it's nice for travel
as long as I wish that had some kind of
cap to it so that it will be even better
for travel but you know you can't have
everything and everything hey I'm just
gonna go ahead and swatch this model Co
blush for you just to show you how the
brush picks up the product there is that
hair and then do I have room on my arm
yes that's one of my favorite model Co
blushes by the way it's absolutely
gorgeous this is the Shea
amaretto sunset it says number three I
really really like that one a lot but
yeah you can see how it kind of doesn't
give you that clown face look but it is
quite pigmented it really is a nice nice
nice brush applies a product very well
it really fits on the face very nicely
and I enjoy it it is very soft as well
and then two more products in here this
is the lightening crew
Norrish with pineapple and green tea
highlighting cream this is very
difficult to work with and that's the
only reason why I don't like it what
I've been doing I made the mistake the
first time I use this and squirting out
quite a bit of it what I've been doing
is just kind of dabbing my finger there
and then highlighting from here let's
see maybe put it here and it is a very
very nice highlighter it's just it's
it's a little difficult to work with and
when I use a cream I always make sure
that I put this on before I put my
powder on to prevent taking so I have to
remember also not to put my powder on if
I plan on using this so that I don't
have that mix of the powder in the cream
so I don't personally prefer cream
highlighters because of that because a
lot of times I'm just on autopilot and
I'm just putting my makeup on in the
typical order and then I get to my
highlighter and it's like man I
completely forgot I was gonna be using
this liquid highlighter so so yeah I
mean this just isn't a product that's
convenient for me to use I don't like
that it's this open top here look it's
already exploding it's like bubbling out
blue look but I don't like the way that
it applies here I wish that it was one
of those tips that had like the like the
real pointy tip with the very small
little tiny hole at the top so that it
only applies just the tiniest bit of
product that would be my biggest
critique for this as far as the quality
of the product I really really like it I
just don't like the packaging and I just
personally don't have a preference for
liquid highlighters I wouldn't call this
a cream highlighter I would call it a
liquid highlighter and then last is
another product that I really really
liked this is the click click click it's
almost feels it feels like a pen when
you click like it it's one more time for
appreciation this is called the do say
click click lipstick and this is in the
full-size Oh with the shade it just says
815 it doesn't say anything else about
the shade
it just says 8:15 and I'll show you what
that looks like it is really really
pretty I'm gonna hand swatch it and then
I'm gonna take my lipstick off and I'm
gonna put it on my lips so isn't that
pretty
and it's not super pigmented which I
like I pulled this out and I was like ah
too scary too scary yeah but then when I
put it and when I put on my lips I was
like oh that's not so bad so let me go
ahead and take off my lip product now
it's a Revlon balm stain I forget what
the shade is I'll put it down below if I
remember to do it but we'll go ahead and
put this on so you can see it is quite
bright but it's not obnoxious to me I
really enjoy the shade a lot and I would
definitely consider buying other colors
of this my only thing about this is when
you do put it on you can really smell
the smell it's a mostly fruity but a
little plasticky yeah I mean it's got
that that makeup smell that I don't
enjoy but it is quite moisturizing and I
am enjoying this product I just wish
that the smell is a little bit odd for
me but if that's my only critique of it
I do enjoy this a product but if cents
bother you you'll probably not like this
lipstick at all so again boxycharm is
amazing and it's not just because I get
it for a review you would know if this
box was terrible I wouldn't be able to
fake it so I mean the S floor mask I'm
excited about the brush I you know it's
a nice brush and my super excited about
it no but I'm like it and I'll
definitely use it I mean it is nice and
then the highlighting cream if the
person who wins the giveaway wants this
I'd be happy to give it to you but just
know that I have swatched it so I don't
know if that bothers you so that's up to
you I'll put this in for giveaway but
you can kind of yay or nay on that one
the nail polish this one's also very
nice it's just the streakiness of it is
kind of a little bit okay I really
really let the bronze are a lot I feel
like it's subtle enough but you know it
does have a little bit of sparkle to it
the lasting power is good and then the
lipstick like I just said I really
really love the color it's just the
smell is a little bit all for me but
overall again I think definitely worth
the $21 subscription prize
