bring you an epic boxycharm review video
for the month of January and I'm
bringing that to you right now as you
may remember in our last episode I
forgot to try the stuff in my November
box it was the holidays okay so I'd want
to do my unboxing of the December box I
promised you that this month I would
review November and December and then
unbox January for you so that's what
we're gonna do and we're getting into it
right now with the November box oh my
gosh I forgot to do my little boxycharm
disclaimer boxycharm says this to me for
review it is $21 a month I do not pay
for it they send it to me but they've
been sending it to me for years and
years and years actually since their
second box of all the time I was one of
the first people to get boxycharm PR
years and years and years ago and they
loved me just the way I am whether I
like it or I don't like it they just
want me to be and be honest so that's
what I'm gonna do for you this is not a
sponsored video okay November box here
we go first product is the setting spray
this is the cover effects illuminating
setting spray if there were a setting
spray that I could possibly like it
would be this one I sucked it up not
literally figuratively sucked it up and
use this a couple of times and I do feel
like it made my makeup last longer if
you don't know this about me I do not
like to spray things on my face
I'm very textural when it comes to my
face I don't like random wet spots on my
face but the sprayer on this I'm not
gonna put myself through it again it's
very it's a nice nice soft mist so I can
handle this one I don't find the
illuminating oops I inhaled it just a
little bit I don't find the illuminating
to be too illuminating where I feel like
it's you know it doesn't make my face
look like greasy or anything so I'm
gonna just spray a little bit on my hand
and let that dry so you can see what it
looks like just on my bare hand it is a
first time shame on you second time so
this is when we put my hands up so you
can see this one is the one with a
setting spray this one is without it is
completely dry at this point and you can
see that this one it's just a tad bit
shinier at least that's what I see with
my naked eye so this is a definite win
for me but however I can't bring myself
to use setting spray so I am going to
pass it along even though I do really
like it
next up is a product that I had did not
have high hopes for but I was pleasantly
surprised this is the winkie luxe kitten
palette that is all I have on my eyes
today I did put on my lid I'm not
wearing fake lashes because I wanted you
to really be able to see the look
without lashes but I put on my lid this
really cool color right here and this
one is called holographic even though
it's not holographic it's duochrome it's
like a pink with a little bit of a green
shift to it and it is absolutely
beautiful again that is what I have on
my lids today and I've used this one on
my lower lash line I have this one and
this one and this one in the crease and
I've used all of these shades at this
point and I'm really enjoying this this
is a $25 eyeshadow palette I feel like
this performs like a $25 typical $25
eyeshadow palette I think that it's
definitely worth the $25
I would pay $25 for this eyeshadow
palette for me if I was transporting my
mind into someone who paid for this I
would be very happy with boxycharm
for this month just because of this
palette right here next I'm gonna show
you these I actually did not use these
because I realized I've already tried
these before you got three of these lip
mask these can see beauty lip masks
collagen infuse I personally think these
are a very gimmicky I don't they're kind
of fun but they're gimmicky they're not
they don't really do much at least from
my experience but I also haven't used
them religiously over a long period of
time so maybe using these for a month if
you had you know thirty of them maybe
you might see some results but because
they're one-time use I'm just it's like
kinda like man they're more fun than
anything they don't for me they don't do
anything bad the ingredients aren't bad
but noticeable difference probably not
so this is something I wasn't super
excited about I decided I wasn't going
to use these but I have so many lucky
brushes lucky brushes are some of my
favorite brushes of all time and I have
similar brushes by luck see that look
just like this so
I decided I'm gonna sing keys for a
future giveaway instead they're these
adorable little travel brushes and these
I mean the quality of the Luxy brushes
are so so so good so this is definitely
would push it over way over the top for
boxycharm for me for November and these
are just gonna go in my box for future
giveaway so yes definitely very happy to
see these in the boxycharm the final
product in the boxycharm for November
was the Alaka and company cloud lips and
I did try this I attempted to try it
twice it's a very dark berry red and
honestly for me I feel like the shade
ages me I feel like it's something that
it just I don't like the way that it
looks on me also I found that it seems
like the shade isn't blended enough like
there are some dark patches within the
formula I've never had this happen to me
with a lip product ever before in my
life where there's like dark patches
within the berry tone like it just
didn't spread the color didn't spread
evenly like it like the formula wasn't
mixed enough if you got this you'll have
to tell me if you had the same
experience with this it was very very
weird so this one's a big no from me now
the question is is this box worth $21 to
me absolutely and I think I've kind of
already given that away I think that if
I were paying for this box full price
this would definitely make it worth it
if I liked if I didn't mind setting
sprays on my face I would have been very
very happy to get this and then with the
Luxy brushes I mean this is worth I mean
25 35 40 55 dollars at least for these
and that's being pretty conservative
these are definitely worth more than 55
dollars this this boxycharm has been one
of my favorites for me personally in a
long time I where I feel like the value
is just really there these two products
I could have done without but these I'm
very very happy with so let's go ahead
and get into the December box okay so
for December let's go ahead and start
with my favorite product in the box well
I have two really good ones in here this
is the pretty vulgar liquid lipstick I'm
starting to really really like Metallica
lips I did the little mini video
on the new solo look Saved by the Bell
set I really like that set I really like
this as well it's a beautiful beautiful
shade on me the formula for this versus
the solo look ones is very very
different where the soul look ones dry
down completely their kiss proof this is
not this is much more hydrating it
almost feels like a thick gloss to go on
rather than a liquid lipstick which
isn't a bad thing it's just different I
do really like it I feel like it wears
down very nicely very evenly and I'm
enjoying it but if you're not into
metallic lips like I've found out a lot
of people are not in new metallic lips
from reading the comments of that solo
look video this would definitely not be
for you that's the way it looks watched
on my hand you can see how metallic it
is the sense of it it's a very light
scent and it doesn't smell like it
smells a little sweet but it doesn't
smell like something you could eat if
that makes sense something artificial
sweet doesn't have a strong scent it's
not an offensive set in any way so I'm
not complaining about it but yeah very
very excited about this and I will
definitely be using this in the future
the next product that I really liked was
the crown brush it's a blush brush from
crown
I like the density of it it's definitely
something different I don't have another
brush quite like this the white tends to
is starting to get a little dirty
already which it's kind of like her but
I mean it is what it is I just have to
make sure I wash it actually believe in
I typically do I love the little dig
here this is really nice for holding the
brush to apply the blush you just have
to be really careful with pigmented
blush blushes with something like this
because the bristles are packed so
densely together they pick up a lot of
product the product picks up on the ends
of the bristles so you have to be
careful with really pigmented products
but other than that really really like
this a lot very thankful to have it now
for the disappointing things I last
month's video I was so excited for this
this is the Tarte TARDIS mascara I
thought I remembered liking this mascara
so either they changed it or my memory
was serving me wrong I don't like it
I mean it's fine if I paid four dollars
for this and I just wanted a little bit
of color on my lip lashes and a little
bit of
I'm dropping it I'd be fine with that
but it's expensive
and it's not worth the price at all I
would compare this to some of my
mediocre drugstore mascaras that are
just okay it's not bad it's just okay
now I have very short sparse lashes so
if you have more voluminous lashes you
may enjoy this a lot more than I do it's
just okay for me and I'm kind of bummed
because I remembered really liking this
and I think I might have been thinking
about something else or something I mean
the packaging is cute but I'm and also
last time I tried this I just remembered
it was a mini so people have told me
before that sometimes there's a
difference in the formula between the
minis and the full size I don't know
anything about that but but yeah point
is this one is a no for me it didn't do
what I needed to do for how expensive
this mascara is okay this one here this
is the real her be fearless be limitless
blush kit I wanted to like this I found
it to be very powdery and also very
glittery this one in the center is the
only one that doesn't have glitter in it
and this shade of blush isn't my
favorite on my skintone I have neutral
skin tone it's just not my favorite it's
too Coralie it's just I don't like it
and these two both have glitter in them
like glitter glitter and what I was
finding is that the color wore down
relatively quickly but the glitter kind
of stayed so you end up with just random
glitter and patchy color and then no
color and it just didn't work for me I
did use it with this brush though and I
did actually like it with this brush
because the baked shadows really aren't
super pigmented so I did like it with
this but I didn't like the formula
overall I'm sad to say I do like the
packaging with the mirror and everything
but the formula was a no for me and then
finally my least favorite product in the
box was the bronze essential beauty
basics contour palette bronzing palette
oh my gosh this I did not enjoy it all
it's really really really warm and along
with being really really warm these
highlights are very very very gold and
for someone like me with a light skin
tone bold highlight especially this deep
of a gold highlight just doesn't look
good on me so I think this would I'm
gonna pass this there on to my neighbor
who I think that this would look
beautiful on I think that she would love
she's of a deeper skin tone at least the
highlighter shades in the center shade I
think she would be able to rock maybe a
little bit of this maybe like a blush
topper for her kind of thing but I'm
gonna pass this on to her because I
think she's really gonna like this but
for me this was some no it just didn't
match me at all
so was this box worth twenty one dollars
no to me absolutely not the only two
products I liked were these and if I saw
these on a shelf for $15 I would buy it
and I know that again my estimates are
conservative I know they're worth
monetarily more than that but that's
what I would pay for it is 15 dollars I
think 20 would be really pushing it I
would have to be in like an impulse buy
kind of mood to buy these for $20 so
unfortunately this one was a bust for me
now let's go ahead and get into what I
got in the January box that I'll be
reviewing in February
we've got Rock 2018 which is kind of a
cool theme and a little card where does
this oh it's the ingredient list for the
dr. Brandt probably what happened with
this because this box is so full they
probably had to throw the boxes away so
that it would fit so they in Korean it
included the ingredient list on a little
cart so let's talk about that this is
the dr. brandt lou manizer primer really
excited to try this I seriously like I
am I'm kind of itching for a new face
primer I feel like I'm kind of over the
ones that I'm using right now like I
want something new you ever get like
that where you just want something new
that's the way I feel about this so I'm
just gonna squeeze a little onto my hand
okay so it is kind of a light fleshy
kind of color and then when you blend it
in it looks like I can still see it just
a tiny bit a little bit of a floral
scent to it it's actually quite strong
of a floral scent so if you're sensitive
the sense I would imagine this would
give you a headache because it is it's
pretty strong floral scent it is a
luminizing primer so that's very trendy
right now the whole luminizing primer
thing so I'm very excited to try this
next up is Grande Lips hydrating lip
plumper it's in the shade midnight
purple I've had really bad luck with
Grande lips as a whole I did not like
their mascara that I've tried in the
past I've never tried this product it is
a very dark berry shade
- let me go ahead and click this up and
see I like the applicator is kind of fun
oh okay so it's like a gloss it's not a
liquid lipstick it's more of a gloss so
that's kind of cool I think I'm more
excited about this now that I realize
it's more of a gloss and not opaque
because the color of it was kind of
scaring me a little bit actually let's
go ahead and put it on real quick oh
it's got a weird smell that is a weird
weird scent I immediately thought of my
aunt's pool from when I was a kid I
don't know why like the place where she
kept the pool toys smelled just like
this that's really weird I haven't
thought about where my hand my aunt kept
the pool toys in like I don't even know
but that's what this smells like
I didn't apply super evenly but it might
just be my fault
let's click up a little bit more it's
not sticky at all over top of this it's
a lip plumper am I gonna start burning
it may my lipstick look really pretty
I'm waiting for the tingle to start I'm
thinking it might have the pepper in it
like the oh here it comes
I think it's tingling a little bit I
like the the rubber applicator here I
think that feels really good oh it's
coming other than this smell it's kind
of fun right now you see is it hurting
yet okay let's move on and I'll let you
know whether this is hurting me in a
minute right now it doesn't really feel
like much I can feel a little tiny bit
of tingling but not bad at all but I'm
actually excited to use this now it says
it has long-term benefits plus 15%
plumpness that's kind of cool okay so
this is the it cosmetics brow power
Universal brow pencil it's in the shade
Universal taupe I've actually tried this
brow pencil before and I don't enjoy it
okay my lips are starting to tingle a
little bit more now just so we can get a
timeline on this but I've already tried
this and I already know that I don't
really like it I find the pencil to be
too hard and it's kind of hard to get
the product to apply the way that I want
it without kind of ripping out my my
brow hairs so this I won't use and it's
also in the wrong shade Universal taupe
is usually a little too
light for me so I'm actually not going
to try this because it's not right for
me and I'd rather pass it on to somebody
that it is right for now we've got the
pure bronze and brighten and this is a
trio of looks like bronze blush
highlighter and bronzer give it a little
swoosh oh they're very pigmented
I don't like super pigmented cheek
products I feel like whoa I feel like
that'd be better as an eyeshadow am I
going crazy here that that would be
better is an eyeshadow this shade is
intense for me that's that's really
intense the bronze shade I don't know if
I would use the highlighter shade is
really beautiful for my skin tone but I
am not sure if the other two shades are
for me I'm gonna have to try this to
find out so you'll find out next month
update on the lip plumper I think that
its maximum plump pain and it didn't get
beyond just a little bit of tingling
it's starting to kind of calm down a
little bit at this point so if you have
ever tried like the Too Faced lip
plumper it's not nearly as intense as
that okay the last thing in here is the
glam metals by crown and I'm actually
really excited at Montrose hmm this
reminds me of straight-up color scheme
from hit paraders remember hit Parader
the magazine like I don't know it just
reminds me of that like 90s like early
90s like 9 89 90 91 92 kind of like hair
metal I'm gonna swatch this whoo they
feel good cuz crown is not the most
expensive brand
they've been very hit or miss with me
with quality of Shadows whoo that black
is a little bit it's gonna be more of a
smoky black rather than an opaque black
which I actually really like they feel
nice they've got a nice nice feeling the
shimmers feel better than the mattes
that one's not good yeah the mattes are
weak but the shimmers look very nice I'm
a little concerned about lasting power
just from touching them I know that
sounds weird that from touching them I
would know anything about lasting power
it's just from testing a lot of
eyeshadows I can the the feeling of them
sometimes leads me to think that they're
like other shadows and it's making me
think that the lasting power may have an
issue but I've never tried to my eyes so
we're going to
till next month for a full verdict right
now I don't have high hopes for these
especially the mats but we're gonna try
it and I really love the color scheme I
think that they did a great job with the
packaging the packaging is super fun
it's really bringing me back to like my
preteen teenager age like really really
excited about this so so far without
trying anything I am excited about this
I am excited about this strangely enough
and I am excited about this so just the
opportunity to try these I think is
probably worth $21 to me but for the
full impression of whether this was
worth $21 you're gonna have to wait
until February when I get my February
