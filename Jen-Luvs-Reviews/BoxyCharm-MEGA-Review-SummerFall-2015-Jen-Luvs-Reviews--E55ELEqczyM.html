hello my friends welcome to a boxycharm
triple review I have had so many
requests for subscription of mohawks
unboxings lately I want to tell you that
I have heard you and I'm going to do my
best to work them back into my filming
schedule I know I have been neglecting
my subscription boxes I didn't realize
how much they were missed
until recently I've been getting so many
comments like dude really are you ever
gonna new subscription boxes again and
the answer is yes they are coming back
to the channel this is my first attempt
at bringing them back I also have a
beauty box 5 review coming up I did tell
beauty box 5 I want to hold off on them
for a little bit because I want to focus
on boxycharm my Birchbox and Ipsy for
now so anyway let's get into the
boxycharm reviews now I've had all of
these for quite a while I did not
receive the October box because I forgot
to change my address with boxycharm when
I moved and did not receive it when we
switched our address our mailing address
so mmm but I have the other three
previous to that I have September I have
August and I have July so let's talk
about all of this Goodis so if you're
not familiar with boxycharm box charmers
21 dollars a month I do receive this as
a free subscription in order to review
it on the channel so just want to let
you know I did not pay for it but it
does not influence my review at all so
anyway let's go into the good the bad
and the ugly from the July box so let's
go into the good first first thing is
the your minerals Sweden transparent
avail I really really like this a lot it
feels like it's just powdered silicon I
don't know what it actually is but it
feels amazing on the skin it does leave
a little bit of a white cast until you
blend it out and then it does seem to
disappear on my skin tone I really swell
that this stuff keeps my makeup on
longer it is really nice and it feels
fantastic when your
done with your makeup look and you just
need a little something just to set
everything together this stuff is
phenomenal I really really have been
enjoying this a lot the other thing I've
really been enjoying is the gorge I'll
make you look amazing daily spray
it's a magical leave-in conditioning
spray that will turn your hair into the
sexiest hair ever now I'm reading this
and I'm like dude for real this is the
most conceited hair product I have ever
seen in my entire life I was like
seriously dude are you that full of
yourself that you're gonna tell me that
it's gonna turn your my hair into the
sexiest hair ever and it says this whole
list of craziness that it does and then
you've gotta get $20 off
use code BC 20 here for for a discount
the bag is like do you believe in magic
well you should I mean just ridiculous
but dude really I'm telling you I don't
know why I'm calling you dude but this
stuff really is nice hey I hate to feed
into its ego but it actually does work
really well I love the way that my hair
looks after I use this I feel like it is
softens I feel like it does keep the
flyaways at bay if that makes sense I
feel like it's smooth my hair out let's
just say that instead it does say that
it is also a heat protectant and I
really really like this I can't really
speak to some of the things like
preventing split ends I don't use it
regularly enough to know whether it's
doing that or not but I do feel like it
enhances natural body creates amazing
silkiness all that stuff it's fab I hate
to say it's fab because like I said it's
egotistical what it is I can't help it
and I got it to be honest with you so I
didn't want like this but I do moving on
to a product that did not work for me is
the MDM a flow mascara now I got an
email from boxycharm that they said to
please make sure I mentioned to you that
with this mascara they do recommend that
you pump it before using it to make sure
that there is good product on there when
I got it it was quite dry but even after
I pumped it and used it I still did not
see a very nice effect with this I
didn't really enjoy this
can see when you pull it out it is a bit
goopy which you know honestly I feel
like some mascaras can be goopy and
still be okay I do not feel like this
one performed effectively it is a very
um it's you know those I don't know how
you call it but it's not a rubber
bristle it's like a brush kind of thing
a plastic brushy kinds of synthetic e
stuff but it just didn't perform when it
comes down to it it just didn't perform
I wanted it to it just didn't next up
another two other positive things that's
really the only negative the Ofra
eyebrow pencil this isn't my favorite
eyebrow pencil but it's nice
I used it twice I haven't used it a
whole lot because I honestly I forgot
about it but it is a nice eyebrow pencil
the only thing about it is it is a
little bit light for my eyebrows which
is one of the reasons why I haven't used
it much and it doesn't stay all that
terribly long I feel like by the end of
the day it's kind of faded a little bit
maybe it's just because of the shade of
it I don't feel like it is he I mean it
is a universal color but I don't feel
like it's dark enough from my particular
hair color so I don't know it's just
maybe this will work better on somebody
with later hair but this one it's okay
for me it's okay
it's not great it's okay and then the
last thing in here is something that I
absolutely love and it's this Vasanti
brush I own a couple of Vasanti brushes
thanks to boxycharm and I really really
love this I use this for blush it's the
perfect shape for blush I've also used
it for contouring here it's a little
round for contouring but it's nice for
blush and I really really like it a lot
it's very soft
I like the dome on it because the
bristles kind of go down a bit it's got
a nice little taper on it to pick up
quite a bit of product but it's not so
super dense then I feel like it picks up
too much product you know what I'm
saying and I also like the longer handle
on it it's very nice to be able to just
put the product on like this it just
feels very pro and I really like this
brush
so overall the boxycharm for me for this
month was a huge win as far as personal
value I would value this at 10 bucks I
would value this at another 10 bucks I
would value this at about $3 I didn't
enjoy it at all I would value
this at about six I would value this at
another ten to twelve dollars so
definitely a huge win on the July
boxycharm let's move on to the August
box each all right now unfortunately for
this box I did misplace the eyeliner
brush
I'll put it if I can find a picture I
will put a picture of it there I
remember really enjoying it
unfortunately I can't find it I don't
know what in the world I did with it but
I did enjoy it and I would value it at
about eight dollars for that brush it
was just it's very fine pointed and it
was very easy to use let's go into the
Neos shield style and protect leaves and
conditioner now unlike the other
leave-in conditioner I did not see a big
difference with this I used it quite a
bit it does say has Moroccan argan oil
in it and it's supposed to have frizz
control and sunburn shield all that this
didn't really do much for me it's didn't
do much that's what I have to say about
that the other thing that we got in this
was was a big win for a lot of people
was a reveal 3 poet I do own this this
happens to be my least favorite of the
revealed palettes I am going to be
giving this away too and I can't tell
who I'm giving this to because it's a
surprise for somebody so I'm not gonna
say who I'm giving this to you but I do
have a home that this was going to go to
because I think that she will really
really like it and she does watch my
videos so I'm not gonna tell who but
this is going to have a good home so the
reveal 3 palette is just not my favorite
I'm not a big fan of the color selection
I find that about 1/3 of the shadows are
powdery they don't go on easily 2/3 of
the palette is pretty nice but it's just
not my favorite at all if you're gonna
pick one of the reveal palettes again I
do recommend the first revealed palette
by Coastal Scents I just you know this
one just did not do it for me but I did
I did actually receive this originally
from Coastal Scents and I did give an
honest review of this if you're curious
about any of my reviews of the reveal
palettes I will
them down below so you can see the
swatches and everything and everything
about what I mean about this palette so
but yeah I mean I I feel like for the
right person this will be fun to play
with but it's really not one that I
would recommend purchasing if you got it
for free yay or if you got in your
boxycharm yay but I wouldn't recommend
going on per she's purposely purchasing
this one all right
that's my personal opinion maybe it
works for you it did not work for me the
other thing that didn't quite work for
me was the statement skin so susan
highlighting crayon it's just it didn't
have good lasting power for me it blends
out very strangely it just doesn't it
doesn't do it for me it's a lot more
subtle than I thought it was gonna be
and it just I don't know it just wasn't
my favorite but what is something that's
really good in here is this mica beauty
eyeliner I did get this I believe in an
FC bag at one point many years ago and
well a couple of years ago many years
ago an Ipsy time and I really like this
eyeliner it does dry out eventually I
give it about six six to eight months
and it'll probably be dried out but
while it lives it is very very nice so
this was the big win of the box for me
so overall I was not very happy with the
August boxycharm not because of the
value the values fantastic it's just the
products inside did not wow me so the
brush was nice so ten dollar value on
that I would also put this at a ten
dollar value as you know a typical
drugstore kind of palette I would put
this at maybe a six dollar value five to
six dollars for this this I would put at
about a fifteen dollar value it's a very
very nice eyeliner and for this hair
product it didn't do anything for me so
I wouldn't purchase this but if I had to
put a value on it I put about six
dollars on that so is this worth twenty
one dollars if you're not gonna use
things is it worth it
that's the question they're the only
thing I'm gonna be using in this is this
so well an eyeliner brush so hmm let's
go ahead and move on to a butter box
which was the Sept
for September we got some really
interesting things the first thing we
got that I use quite a bit of is this
provides skin type one two six oil free
tonic infused with antioxidant rich
daisy flower extract and hyaluronic acid
to help lighten and brighten skin
this is a typical skin care product for
me I have normal skin I don't have
problem skin when I try skincare
products they don't really do a whole
lot for me it's very rare I can say a
skin care product actually looks like
it's doing anything this is no exception
it does feel nice it smells nice and
says it has really great ingredients in
it so I have to trust that over time
this thing is doing something good for
me but I can't say I saw any visible
results for it it doesn't have any kind
of weird funky smell or anything it's
got kind of a like a floral it smell
it's got a daisy floral kind of smell to
it the feel of it is just very wet it's
not oily or anything um and it feels
nice it feels like it's it's a nice
skincare product but again I didn't see
any visible results but I'm not really
holding it against that because you know
I don't really see visible results with
a lot of skincare the next thing is
something that I did not choose to use
yet the scratch nail wraps I have you
scratch nail wraps before and I do
really really like them they do claim
that they can last for a very long time
I have not found that to be true about
scratch nail wraps of course I didn't
try these specifically but scratch nail
wraps lasts usually about two to three
days on me before the first chip I have
to take them off usually I buy about a
four or five they look a hot mess and I
have to take them off but they do have
some very cute patterns over at scratch
and if you like nail wraps this may be
something for you one thing about these
kinds of nail wraps is if you have very
short nails a lot of times these will
not work they really only work for long
nails because the patterns don't stretch
very far so like for example for this
one here it's got a a blank space here
when you can't write your name in it but
it's got a blank space but if that's
gonna fall about the middle of my nail I
know males aren't need to be done but
you know I mean it's just you know I
mean they work better on longer nails so
if you have longer nails and you like
fun designs
definitely check out scratch but just
know that they don't last as long as
they claim
least on me I'm a pretty active person
maybe if you don't you're not as active
hand wise maybe it'll last longer for
you but they don't last that long for me
a product that I do really like that I
have not opened yet I have tried this
before this is the cella eyebrow
defining gel I do compare this to the
Anastasi eyebrow gel it is very very
similar it is very wet to go on it dries
a little bit crunchy just like the
artist Asya I would say this is a dupe
for that so if you like that kind of
formula probably like that this one it
is a brush brush format and it's a nice
brow gel I personally don't prefer the
crunchy brow so I will probably be
passing this on to a friend but you know
it is a nice brow gel if you like that
kind if you like the kind of gives you a
little crunch whoa one thing that I
really liked in this was the
surprisingly the Kardashian Beauty a
black seed dry oil this is a hair oil
really like the Weymouth this made my
hair feel really tame the flyaways
things like that it does have a very
nice smell as well it smells like
perfume
it's got like kind of like an earthy
kind of perfume scent but not patchouli
smelling just you know just very warm up
perfume kind of scent and I really
really like the way that this felt but I
do feel like that this worked I wish it
was a bigger size that's the only thing
that kind of made me cry because it is
Kardashian beauty which is a drugstore
brand I wish that they had given us a
full-size of this that would have been
very nice but you know the other thing
in here that is okay for me was this
brush here this is another Vasanti brush
I do like Vasanti brushes I understand a
big fan of foundation brushes this is a
very flat brush I just don't like the
way they feel they weren't great I just
feel like I'm painting my face with a
real paintbrush and it just doesn't feel
right to me like I prefer a more round
brush I just don't I don't know I just I
don't prefer this the shape just for
feeling purposes but it does work very
very well and I love these long handles
it's very very nice so yes thumbs up on
the Musante brush if you like this kind
of brush and then the last thing in here
was the tarts motorized Amazonian clay
waterproof liner
this is in the shade gold I really like
this a lot I used this in my outer
corner my center of my lid to my outer
corner and I really liked it a lot
staying power was okay blendability is
very nice you can like you can blend it
out and then you can build it back up
it's very very nice product you also
have the smudger on the side that you
can use to kind of smudge the color in
and it's a really nice lid color and
especially if you have a deeper skin
tone I think this would look gorgeous as
a lid color I don't like it all over my
lid I feel like it's a little deep for
me for all over my lid but as far as
like accentuating the outer corner I
really really like it a lot
so definitely a win on this so for the
September boxy trauma
I really feel like it was a good deal I
really like this a lot I would value
this at $15 because it's short I really
like this but it's so small I would only
value this at $2 I really like this
brush well I would say I really like it
I don't like this brush because of my
personal preference but if I had to
value this I would put this also at
about $15 neat Shella eyebrow I put this
at a value of about $8 maybe 7 this is a
full size it says it's $18 but I
wouldn't pay $10 for this I would pay
eight to ten dollars for this I mean you
think about I don't know the crunchiness
gets me the crunchiness getting the nail
wraps I feel like these are pretty
overpriced for what you get for them so
I would pay $6 for these and then for
this this is a nice skin care item with
lots of good ingredients in it so I
would pay $20 for this so definitely a
win for $21 for the September box I
think it was a great box the only bust
out at the release three boxes for me
was the August boxes just because I
didn't really like the products that
were inside it was a good value I just
didn't care for the products inside but
overall I mean I love my boxycharm I
feel like it's probably the best deal in
all of subscription boxes as far as what
you get when it compared to the other
ones that I get if CBOC Birchbox I feel
like you get the most bang for your buck
so that's my review of three months of
boxycharm I hope you enjoyed that if you
did make sure you hit the subscribe
button so you don't miss future
boxycharm unboxings and reviews I do
want to try once again to do these
monthly that is my goal I'm not making
promises but my goal is to do the
monthly I might do more of an unboxing
style rather than a review just to make
sure they come out because the reviews
take a lot longer to come out and I have
to time them perfectly cuz I don't want
to be too old but I want to give myself
some time to try it so I may not be
trying everything in the box before the
review but I do want to show you what's
in it and give you kind of initial first
impressions at least so I want to thank
you so much for staying with me even
though I haven't been doing as many box
reviews I appreciate you being here
and look forward to more box openings
and reviews in the future Mad Love and
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
