now this has become my favorite
subscription over the past few months
they have just upped their game to a
tremendous level like I am so excited
for boxycharm they actually featured me
on the front page of their website I
don't know if it's still going to be
there when you go visit boxycharm today
but back seat Ron and I are becoming
quite good friends even though I haven't
been that nice to them in the past with
some of the products they've said but
now that we're there they're up in their
game I guess they're liking me a little
more coz I'm liking them a little more
in our relationship you know but but I
promise you guys even though I do get
this as a promo box I promise you I will
always be honest no matter what and you
guys will know because you'll know if
these are crap products or not and if
I'm like I get like you know a
fingernail pic and I'm like this is so
cool like I'm so excited about this
fingernail pic like you guys will
totally know and so I have to be honest
because you know the difference being a
crap product and the not crap product
and you're gonna know let's go ahead and
open up boxycharm box of charmers 21
dollars a month and they have told me
that there are a hundred and twenty-five
dollars worth of products in this box
here so I'm curious to know what it is
because just because it has a high value
does not mean that they are useful
products and if you would never use a
product there's no point and having it
be worth a ridiculous amount of money
you know what I'm saying go ahead and
open up and see what we got alright they
have the little card and it says spring
beauty and they are now including all of
the prices on the back so I'm not going
to look at that and it's just talking
about spring and it says over 100
dollars worth of products and putting
away winter clothes feeling beautiful
fresh air blah blah got all that good
stuff
beautiful purple paper this is my actual
favorite color of all time this lavender
purple I love it okay so this is what
I'm seeing and I think I might see some
julep nail polishes in here and I have
kind of ridiculous julep nail polish
collection because I do have julep I
don't feel like it's exciting enough to
film julep but if you're interested in
julep box openings let me know and I can
do those for you but I just don't think
that they're that exciting because it's
like oh my god I got a pink polish and a
green polish yeah you know
I just don't think it's that exciting
let's say it says strange beautiful
let's see what this day they're
definitely julep shaped polishes no
they're not julep polishes they look
like jewel polishes but they are not
julep polishes they're made by a company
called strange beautiful and it's a
three free product and made by strange
is Jane LLC strange beautiful dot biz
interesting in case you're not familiar
with julep this is a julep polish and
you can see that they are very similar
in packaging cool okay so this one is
they don't have names on them that's a
little disappointing you know I I kinda
like the idea of color names or at least
numbers or something to identify them
but there is like a dusty rose like pink
and then there is a gray really like
these I'm excited to try them will do a
drip test who thick I can feel how thick
they are super thick one to two coats on
that one let's try this one
this one doesn't feel quite as thick but
looks thick I'm definitely gonna say one
to two coat on these and this is an
absolutely beautiful pairing like of
these two shades so I will definitely be
rocking this very very soon very happy
to have those let's see what we got up
next okay we got a party proof cream
lipstick by model CO and I am a big fan
of model coat products I've never tried
one of their lipsticks they're lip
glosses have this little mirror on the
side too which is very nice for travel
and it is a bright bright bright pink in
order for me to feel comfortable wearing
this I will probably have to pair it
with a nude color but that's okay I
don't well I am very pigmented that's
what I would expect from model Co a blue
tone paint so it does feel very creamy
on my skin I'm not the biggest fan of
blue toned Pink's I feel like they look
a little odd on my skin tone but I can
pair this with other shades and make it
work the shade and this one is called
flirt so very excited to have that as
well okay next we
covered in some kind of dust bellapierre
cosmetics and where did I see Belle
appear Belle up here I saw that
somewhere recently was that in that was
a nut in another box bellapierre was
that in my beauty box fine
I shoot I'm shooting all these beauty
box videos in the same day and I know I
got something nice from bellapierre I
did this is Belle appear that appears
coming out of nowhere it's hitting up
the beauty box circuit so this I just
got in my beauty box 5 which just went
up a couple of days ago and this is the
makeup base so now I also have a mineral
eyeshadow buy them in the shade earth
and we'll go ahead and we will swatch
that it does have the sifter on top
which I really like I get a little more
when when they don't have sifter on top
because I would get worried about them
spilling okay whew very pretty it's like
a rose gold bronzy kind of color more
bronze than rose gold but it definitely
has a touch of pink in there with the
bronze very unique also very pretty
they're excited to try that I'm a huge
fan of mineral eyeshadow so love that
and then we've got two more things in
here this is the this was the one they
advertise that they were gonna have in
here this is a full-size per lease
normal to dry anti-aging hydra balanced
moisturizer so very excited to try this
it's for hands mm-hmm yeah and my hands
are definitely starting to get that
aging look I'm starting to be able to
see the veins and all that which is
really a little creepy so maybe it'll
help to slow those signs of aging that
would be nice oh and it also says you
can put it over your face day and night
so after cleansing and toning so very
excited to get that I've heard that this
is kind of obnoxiously expensive let me
see how much that cost yep $55 for this
baby right here and again this is a $21
subscription so that is pretty stinkin
awesome so very excited to try that the
last thing I see is another bellapierre
oh it's the makeup base then I just got
in my beauty box fine so funny
okay this one because I just got this in
my beauty box five I sure don't need two
of them so
I am going to give this away to one of
you beautiful people I will go ahead and
swatch it for you let me make sure that
this is the same shape hold up hold up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
