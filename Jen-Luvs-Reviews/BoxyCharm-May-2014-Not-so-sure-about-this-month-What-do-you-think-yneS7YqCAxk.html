charm now this box of chocolate is very
different than the last boxy charm that
I showed they change the packaging they
are more eco-friendly now and they're
sending it just like this they used to
send it in a black outer box with a
black inner box with a ribbon around it
now this is the only box they send my
mailing address is actually on the back
here so yeah so that I think that's kind
of nice that they've cut down on their
packaging maybe that cuts down on their
cost a little bit so they can provide a
little bit even more awesomeness in
their box little background on boxy
charm back to charm is 21 dollars a
month I do receive this as a promotional
box but I do not get any other perks
other than the fact they send this to me
every month I always promised to give
you an honest review of what I think of
this and so far this year I have been
very very happy with boxy charm since
January they have set amazing amazing
amazing boxes all worth I believe either
very close to or over a hundred dollars
worth of products this is actually my
favorite subscription right now I get
asked a lot what's my favorite
subscription and right now it genuinely
is box you try and follow closely by
ypsi so let's go ahead and open and see
what is in the box each arm and this one
is all about Mother's Day and it is May
from mothers day and I am a mother so I
appreciate that it is celebrating
mothers all that love for amazing moms
and it's got all of the products on the
back okay first thing I see is a
Mirabella lip color and I do love
Mirabella products I their primer is one
of face primer is one of my favorite
face primers of all time just shut in an
empties video not that long ago love
their eyeshadows as well let's see oh
I'm never going to wear this color in
life now we're going to wear this color
in life ok I'm going to give this away
if anybody would like this lipstick I
would be happy to give it to you i'm not
going to swatch it but you can see kind
of the color there and then this is
called heat and if this is a color that
is you think will work for you go ahead
and put in a comment below that you're
interested in winning the lipstick well
after about 24 28 hours after this video
is uploaded i will select a winner i do
random org and make sure it's within 24
hours because if it isn't
within 24 hours and I think they've
always over so double-check that before
you answer alright next thing I see is
nail couture Lauren the beauty of
Beverly Hills never heard of them and
it's a male nail polish remover enjoy
they nail polish remover pads I think
they're pads in here that's cool though
always up for new nail polish remover
right now I don't have my nails painting
which is very odd for me I just didn't
have time to paint him before shooting
and I just want to get my videos done
for the day all right yep oh they
actually smell very nice they smell like
berries never snowed a nail polish
remover that smells that good oh that
smells nice you get 15 of them very nice
anxious to try those cool and then the
next thing I see is a Novak's
professional food therapy therapy from
my food it's an olive oil this is a hair
food I'll slice they're giving me food
products of boxing sure that's a first
we take it a no vex product before but
it had to be used with a salon a hair
dryer which was kind of strange I hope
this one does not have to be used with a
salon hair dryer everything looks like
it's in Spanish let's look at the card
maybe the card will give me a hint oh it
says here it says use a conditioner uses
a conditioner after shampoo for deep
nutrition all for deep nutrition apply
and leave on here 15 to 20 minutes and
then rinse ok cool so boxy trauma
explained it to me in English so it's
kind of almost like a meanie box at this
point they send yourself in other
languages oh there's another one it's an
argan oil one same thing all in spanish
and i guess it's the same kind of
situation where you put it on as a
conditioner cool i will definitely try
that excited about that and then we got
a little kabuki brush that's cute only
we've ever gotten a brush before I
remember right mmm that's that's kind of
that's a little dance that'll probably
work I typically like my brushes a
little more dense than this but that's
really cute I don't work nice I wonder
if the color will come up with come out
when i try to wash it will have to wait
and see who makes this there's no
information on here faroe cosmetics I
think we got an eyeshadow from Pharaoh
once at least i'm not sure if it was
from this subscription or
different one but i have an eyeshadow
from them i think fubuki brush has
porous bristles that absorb minerals and
apply evenly and expertly bristles are
soft and silky and won't scratch the
precious dermal layers of the skin it is
very very soft so you apply finishing
powder mineral powders or to add and
blend your blush ok does feel very nice
it's very very soft and then the last
thing I see it is the biggest thing and
it is this and this says desert tulip
lavish hand cream and this is ginormous
go be lovely lavish and cream I will go
be lovely it's floral but not
offensively so sometimes I feel like
floral stuff is very strong and grandma
smelling it's very thin at least
whatever popped out was very thin mm-hmm
look greasy is it gonna seep in let's
wait and see still Gracie still really
kind of greasy not too bad not the
greasiest lotion I've ever felt now it's
starting to seep in it's getting a
little better getting a little better
yeah not bad I'm not a big fan of a
smell though it's got lecom go I don't
know gardenia honeysuckle kind of smell
oh there you go red tulips white tea
roses and lilies I was way off on that
one yeah not a big fan of the smell of
that at all but but it's okay I'll use
it or I'll pass it along to somebody so
here we go so we've got the lavish hand
cream which is full-size it's worth
twenty dollars the Mirabella lip color
is worth 22 that's going to be for one
of you guys the natural the nail polish
remover pads is fifteen dollars from
that many holy moly that's expensive
firm for 15 pads it's $15 a dollar a
pound I would never pay a dollar a pad
for nail polish remover unless the stuff
is magical it very magical says it's
acetone free maybe that's why because it
won't damage my nails hopefully it works
the Kabuki brush is twenty dollars
probably moment this is twenty dollars
only Oh know about twenty dollars holy
moly it is nice though and then the
argan oil
samples it just says they're 30 grams
each soft figure out how much those are
worth overall a pretty good boxy charm
definitely not as excited about this
form as the other ones I've seen this
year this is probably my least favorite
of the ones that I we've gotten this
year but I mean it's not a bad box it's
just not a great box I you know that the
lipstick has some potential but it just
wasn't a color that I was into I think
I'm most excited actually about these
nail polish pads even though they're way
way expensive that's insane thank you so
