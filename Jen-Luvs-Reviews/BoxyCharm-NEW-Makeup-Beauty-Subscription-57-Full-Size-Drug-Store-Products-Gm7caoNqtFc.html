say stinkin excited what does that even
mean anyway I got a new subscription box
and this is I'm not gonna show you this
side cuz it has my address on it but
this is a new subscription service
called boxing charm I was contacted by
boxycharm to do a review of their BOTS
now as I opened this let me tell you a
little bit about boxy charm now boxy
trunk is very different from the other
subscriptions in that it is all
drugstore stuff and if you watch my box
openings you know how much I am annoyed
by getting drugstore stuff in my beauty
boxes but here's the thing
now with boxy charm it's all full-sized
drugstore products what annoys me is
when I get a $40 new Beauty test tube
and they give me little tiny Pantene
samples or something like that and it's
just like are you kidding me seriously
where they get this stuff is from
overstock kind of like the way TJ Maxx
and Marshalls and places like that
you overstock make up and this is right
get in to get overstock make up and then
they resell it
well what boxycharm does is they give
you its I'll put the correct number here
but I think it's 5 to 6 or 6 to 7
full-sized beauty products so this
subscription service is only for people
that enjoy drugstore products don't like
drugstore products you're not gonna like
this but I think most people do like
drugstore products and I think that a
lot of us are really interested in
trying new drugstore products because we
don't want to waste even 5 to 10 dollars
on a beauty product that's terrible
my first complaint about this is that I
can't get it open the tape was just
decorative goodness gracious
ready it's like a real smooth shiny box
it says box to trim and it's got the
little pretty blue bow on here all right
so it says welcome to boxycharm I'm not
gonna read that to you because it's long
and then it's got what
what is up graveyard girl cause these
worms see something pretty already and
that's what it looks like on the inside
got a little boxycharm sticker oh my
goodness I'm excited already okay so
first thing we got was project one
runway limited edition L'Oreal super
blendable blush ooh how pretty oh I mean
even limited edition I mean maybe I was
you know I I'm always up for getting
things that are limited edition because
I can never find them in my area like
ever ever okay so there we go there's
it's it's in the Queen's blush wash that
for you hmm doesn't it seem super
pigmented yeah not very pigmented try
that one more time let's really try to
get a good swatch it's very soft
maybe it was just a film on the outside
here we go here we go that's better even
with some high-end blushes sometimes you
have to break through a film so I do
think that I don't know it's a little
powdery I'll have to let you know about
this whether this is good or not yeah I
don't know this one's a maybe my next
stop is by Revlon it's complete oh wait
no it's but diamond is it supposed to be
shattered I don't think so oh that makes
me sad you know what but these
subscription companies are really good
about fixing things you know and and
giving you something else if something
breaks yeah it looks like it was really
really pretty see it's it's broken on
the back you can see that it's shattered
through there oh so sad so yeah I'm
really sad about this Revlon diamonds
lost eyeshadow I might be able to get
some get some out of the back oh it is
super super glittery very very glittery
and it's falling all over me
I really like to try that it's in the
story pink this is a Sally Hansen
natural beauty luminizing face primer
and I am really excited to try this I
have never used the Sally Hansen beauty
product before I've only ever used their
nail product so I will let you know
about this and a favorites and sales
video if it is amazing or horrible I
will let you know but I'm excited to try
that and then we got these are gorgeous
oh pretty
L'Oreal color each nail lingerie fancy
fancy and these look like they're almost
like fishnet stockings with diamonds on
them limited edition Diamond Collection
3d stickers so those look really really
really pretty I'm excited to try those
okay there's two more things in this box
so now we've got one two three four five
we've got six products altogether this
is a L'Oreal nail color and sparkle
ishes I'm anxious Strether's that's
number 605 I'm actually going to swatch
it on one of my nails right now okay so
that's what that looks like that is just
so pretty
there's a nail without there's a nail
with really really sparkly and pretty a
mix of smaller glitters and larger
glitters and then this last one is
another Project Runway it's a lipstick
by L'Oreal and this is going to be nice
for winter time it is in the color the
temptress kiss wow that is super torch
holy good Jolie and there is what that
looks like there it is a deep plum berry
and then here is the swatch of that so
so pretty I'm anxious to try that for
wintertime overall we've got six
full-size drugstore products I you know
I'm gonna have to put the value here of
what was in the box if you are
interested in trying some new drugstore
products or if you missed out on some
limited edition products that are no
longer available you never know what
you're gonna get they have a lot of
Essie nail polishes that I've seen in
