the October boxy charm and my unboxing
true actual unboxing of the November
boxy charm I love me some boxy charm but
boxy charm sometimes has some messes so
let's go ahead and talk about it right
about now I'm especially excited for
boxy charm at this month because it is
in this video is in collaboration with
my friend Tiffany dawn I will be linking
her channel below her boxy charm reviews
are very similar to mine and that she
does something called preview and review
which is basically the same thing that I
do where I give you a review of the
previous month's month and then I give
you a preview of what is going to be
reviewed next month so it's basically
the same thing she just came up with a
cute name that I didn't think of so I
will link to Havanese video down below
of her boxy charm review let's go ahead
and get into mine so let's talk about
what we got in October and I love this
because even if you don't get boxy charm
it will give you an idea of reviews of
these products so you can decide whether
you would want to purchase them or not
oh I always forget this part people
always ask me boxycharm is $21 a month
it is sent to me for review it's been
sent to me for years and years and years
that never influences my review
boxycharm loves me as long as I'm honest
so I'm gonna continue to be honest with
you I don't believe that this is
available very far internationally I
think you can get it in Canada but I
think that's it as far as outside of the
United States so let's talk about these
things let's start with the DLS I shadow
crayon this is fine I think this is nice
for someone that wants a very light look
going to school or work that doesn't
want to think about it just wants to
just go train train train train train
train in the morning and be done with
their eye look it's nice for that I
tried this on its own I also tried it
paired with other eyeshadows I find it
to be a little bit patchy not quite as
punchy and pigmented as I personally
enjoy I mean it's fine but it's
definitely not something I would go out
and purchase more of there's nothing
standout about this product for me so
that's kind of how I feel about this
it's the shade illusion it's fine it's
not bad it's fine
dirty little secrets just as a brand
hasn't been super impressive to me so
far but I'm I have my hopes up because
they are an indie brand all ways have my
hopes up for any brands that they're
gonna give me something good so
crossing my fingers that the next
product I tried from them is gonna
really Wow me the next one is one that I
did not try this time this is actually
gonna go in for future giveaway this is
a microdermabrasion by dr. Brandt it's
called the pore dermabrasion I've tried
this multiple times from multiple Beauty
boxes and it's good if you like that
physical exfoliator if you like that
sandy grit to exfoliate your face you're
really really gonna like this the only
thing is is just be careful using this
too often because you can actually cause
damage to your skin if you physically
exfoliate too much especially with the
coarse grit like this just be careful
with it I wouldn't recommend using this
but more but once a week a maximum it
says it helps refine the appearance of
pores the cleanses pores help smooth the
appearance of skin texture and I
definitely agree with this just be
careful with the frequency that you're
using it because it is like I said it
can be a little gritty and a little
harsh on the skin next up we have a
couple of lip products this is the lip
liner by Jhumpa blue and this is in the
shade rich red and also the tardis lip
paint this is in the shade XOXO i did
pair these together for an episode of
what's up and makeup i will put a little
clip next to me or in front of me
somewhere so you can see what it looked
like on me with this paired I did wear
them individually alone as well I can
say that I am definitely a fan of the
lip liner more than the liquid lipstick
so let's start there it's a very creamy
lip liner I do find that it extends the
wear of my lipsticks keeps my lipsticks
in line which is what lip liner is
supposed to be or goes and it's very
very nice I have no complaints about
this it does everything I want it to do
it's creamy but not too creamy and it's
just it's a good product it's a good
product
now the tardis lip paints when these
first came out I actually really liked
the formula I have one from the
graveyard girl collection can't remember
off the top of my head what it's called
but I really like that formula a lot of
people didn't like it because it didn't
dry down completely I like that these
are too drying for me means I can't
stand from more than five minutes
they're just too dry so what I do is I
pair them with a lip balm not a lip
gloss but a balm I feel like a lip gloss
a lot of them will make this slip and
slide around my lips and will end up
going outside of my lip line which I
don't like but with a lip
it gives it just enough hydration so
that it feels comfortable my lips and it
doesn't slide around so do I hate this
formula no do I dislike it yes but it
can be fixed it can be doctored with a
lip balm so there you go just so you
know if you're having trouble with this
being true drying try lip balm and then
finally we have the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector a liquid I was so excited
to get this so excited because I do have
Prosecco pop which is the shade I have
it in the powder form in my Jacqueline
Hill backup palette but I didn't have
the liquid form and I really wanted to
try this and I think I'm learning that I
just don't like liquid highlighters
I feel like this makes my pour just go
like hollow pours it just makes them
look like they are so they're where I
feel like with the the pressed kind I
don't feel like it does that I guess
it's just the way it is with liquid
versus powder I have tried this with a
stippling brush I have tried it padded
on with my fingertips and I've tried it
with a Beauty Blender I even tried that
because someone suggested that I do that
I do like it best applied with a Beauty
Blender I feel like it melds into the
skin a little bit better with that but
overall I'm just not having fun with
this which made me kind of sad because
this is a super high value item I
definitely want to make sure I pass this
on because it is I mean it can be nice
for the right person but it just it
wasn't right for me it just didn't work
for me
so overall was this worth $21 I really
think that that's gonna depend on what
you like and what you enjoy personally
for me based on after trying it I would
say no just because a lot of it didn't
work out for me
the only thing in here that I really
really loved was the lip liner by janta
blue I love this lip liner I would
repurchase multiple more shades of this
I'm very excited about this the Tarte is
a little too much work this just didn't
Wow me this I've tried a million times
and it is kind of course for what I
enjoy at this point there were times
when I liked an exfoliator this course
but then once I learn more about
skincare I kind of stopped using things
like this so this one's kind of a no and
then this one ended up not working out
for me even though it's Becca it's a
high value item this one just for the
reasons that I mentioned earlier just
didn't work out for me so $21 but this
is the only thing that I really really
liked so that kind of makes me sad but I
can see
why a lot of people would pay $21 for
this it's just this one you know didn't
end up working out for me unfortunately
but it was fun to try it so I'm thankful
to have been able to try it alright
let's break out the scissors I just
realized I still have my fall background
this is the last time you're gonna see
the fall background because I need to go
get a winter backgrounds and because
Thanksgiving is over so therefore it's
time to move on with our lives so this
is a true unboxing of this oh okay well
here we go let's start with this
this is the cover effects illuminating
setting spray if you don't know I'm not
a fan of spraying things on my face I
have a texture thing where I just don't
like the way setting sprays feel should
I even try it
that's the question oh it's got a little
nail-polish ball in there I mean I feel
like somebody could definitely still use
this if I only spray it on my face once
so let's check out the sprayer let's do
it I'm scared already oh well done cover
effects I should not have tried to talk
while that was in the air that is a very
nice mister there I can barely even feel
it
Wow this may be a setting spray I can
actually use hmm what's the ingredients
where's the alcohol how much alcohol is
in this water butylene glycol PvP Wow
there there's not a lot of alcohol in
the first ingredients whoa this may be a
setting spray I can actually use well
I'm excited about that
did you see how light that mist was okay
all right cover effects bringing it this
is a Lexie quad I travel set oh how cute
oh how cute I am a huge fan of Luxy
brushes I'm not sure if you know that
but I am I will probably end up passing
this I don't know should I pass these on
because they're so cute and I'm doing
more traveling now and it's like the
perfect trip the shapes that they chose
are great so we've got a packing brush
we've got one to get color up into the
crease this one can be used for blending
and then you've got a little tiny C
shaped brush there for like really
detailing what a nice little sad I don't
know I'm mmm I've so many brushes off to
think about whether I'm gonna actually
try these or pass these on I'm gonna
have to think about it
because I kind of want to save them but
do I really need them no but that's
pretty cool next up we have the what is
that log cloud lips laga what is this
let me look at the thing Oh Lakha and
company Lakha and company there we go
cloud lips it looked like laga but it's
Lakha and company let's see what we got
ooh this is deep nice to see a deep
color especially this time of year no
sense that's good well I was expecting
it to be brown but it's like a berry red
ooh that's so pretty oh I'm excited it
feels very moist I'm excited about that
in the packaging reminds me of Charlotte
Tilbury Stephanie Nicole given me some
of her Hollywood lips because she didn't
like me this is the show it's Hilberry
and then this is the land company they
look very similar I like the little
window in the Charlotte Tilbury but
still very pretty very pretty and then
we have some case nc Beauty all natural
collagen infused lip masks I feel like
these are nice for like a very temporary
kind of situation
I've tried these I think in my what the
K series I tried one of these and was
just kind of like man and then I
remember I watched a video where they
tried out a ton of these and I can't
remember what was if I find it I will
link it down below where they basically
decided that these really don't
you anything long-term they're just nice
for like a temporary thing kind of
overpriced since they're only one time
used and you can buy a lip balm that'll
do a lot more for you for less expensive
so not super excited about these I'll
probably use like one and then pass the
rest on is like giveaway bonus something
like that
and then the last thing in here is the
Winky lux kitten palette that is
adorable
and then oh I like these shades I've
been getting more into like pink eye
shadow looks you wouldn't know from what
I'm wearing right now you wouldn't know
but I'm really liking me like the maulvi
pinks and stuff instead of going the red
orange II route like super warm going
more toward the pinks and the grays so
really excited about this let's go ahead
and do a little swatch and feel oK we've
got a little bit of crumbling there but
that's not necessarily a bad thing this
one is very satiny ooh look at that is
that a jewel crumb whooo that is a duo
crumb this one right here has a green
shift to it like a Bluegreen shift it's
almost like a mint shift
oh that's cool well done doing something
different
these look nice this one has a little
bit of grit to it but probably has to do
with the amount of pigment in there I'll
just pop the hold that up just so you
can see a little bit but that looks nice
I'm excited to play with this nice
swanky luxe first impression as I'm
excited so overall I feel like boxycharm
did a really good job on this we've got
a setting spray that I might actually be
able to use and I brush set that I kind
of want to keep but I might not an
eyeshadow palette that the shades are
really calling to me the lip product
that seems really nice and then the lip
masks that I don't really care about so
but yeah so far it looks like it's
totally worth $21 but we're gonna have
to wait till next month to find out
whether it actually is so I want to
