hello my friends welcome to my January
boxy charm unboxing it's boxy charm is
21 dollars a month I'd ever see this as
a promotional subscription but I promise
you it does not influence my review at
all i am not afraid to tell box you try
on what i think and they know this and
they still send it to me because that's
how awesome of a company that boxy charm
is Boxxy Trump is currently my favorite
beauty subscription because I feel like
you consistently get the most value with
the most valuable valuable products
because i think that the value of the
actual products as far as the usefulness
of the products is just as important as
their monetary value as far as retail
price so let's see if this box lives up
to that height first thing in here we
got two products from a company called
beauty for real which I've never heard
of in my life but I'm anxious to try
these now I did just get this box not
too long ago so I haven't had a whole
lot of time to try everything out but i
can give you kind of some initial first
impressions the first product that i got
from this company is the true lip cream
it is in the color always there and if
you watch a lot of beauty videos on
youtube you may recognize this format
from another company that's over hyped
on youtube it's got a mirror and the
light but honestly I know people say the
lights unnecessary but if you're ever
like if I'm ever like out on a date and
I need some lip gloss on the line is
actually kind of a handy with the mirror
and everything or if your girl goes out
clubbing or whatever and if you're just
out late at night or whatever and you're
trying to touch up it's actually quite
useful if you're a daytime gal it's not
going to be useful I mean you know the
mirror I think is useful for everybody
but but let me just go on and just show
you kind of what is up with this I have
some old swatches on my hand let me just
if I can rub those off and they should
actually get a makeup remover white told
off alright if you're new to youtube
videos and you don't know which company
i'm talking about i'm at a company
called Gerard cosmetics that makes these
lip glosses that have the same kind of
thing going on and they've just they
were really really hyped on youtube for
a while I haven't seen a whole lot from
them lately the big thing right now
they're not a new overhyped brand is
color pop it's everywhere but supposedly
there it's an amazing brand and I do
like the drug cosmetic lip products for
the record but anyway off topic let's
watch this one and this is the beauty
for real one and you can see that it's
more of a liquid lipstick than anything
it says that it is a lip cream EEMA so
yeah it's not a lip gloss it's a lip
cream and it's very very opaque and
pretty and I am excited to use this
should I put it on I should probably put
it on for you let's put it on hmm now is
the time when I taste the nasty makeup
remover on my lips but I do it for you
because I really want you to see what
this is like if disgusting all right is
it gone that was to face pink chocolate
by the way it's my favorite lipstick
right now absolute fav and let's go
ahead and let's use the mirror oh isn't
that convenient okay it smells terrible
colors a little redder than I expected
that's not necessarily a bad thing oh no
what y'all think I'm kind of on the
fence in this little tiny mirror let me
look in a bigger mirror mmm you think I
can pull it off I'm wearing some green
eyeshadow for my girl Amanda who said I
she thinks I would look better in some
colors rather than all the neutrals I
always wear so I wore this eyeshadow for
Amanda and now I'm thinking then the
lipstick might not match the eye shadow
I don't know what do you think Amanda do
you think it's looking all right y'all
think it looks all right I don't know i
mean i think that the smell is very
off-putting I can still smell it it
smells not good it smells lip sticky and
nasty you know who this but the colors
nice you didn't get through the smell I
guess all right let's move on to the
next product from from beauty for real
and it says BF are the only lip pencil
you'll ever need and I am NOT a big lip
pencil person because I don't wear a lot
of bold colors so when I wear my nudes I
don't really need a lip pencil in my
opinion and it looks like this would
match very nicely with the lip product
that's on my lips right now of course
now I'm like thinking I should put a lip
this unfort oh well too late alright so
any
I I am I don't really use a lot of lip
pencils but I am thankful to have this
is a really nice neutrally kind of color
I think it would look good on most skin
tones can't say I'm super excited about
it because I don't wear a lot of lip
pencils but I am very thankful to have
it next up is something that I was not
too excited about and it's these these I
know are all the rage for you young kids
out there these are these tattoos here
this is by pur Lisse and their skin
Sparkle flash tattoos you get one sheet
and it is a retail value of twelve
dollars which i think is kind of crazy I
hope that one sheet isn't $12 it looks
like it is one sheet is twelve dollars
but I mean if you're I mean if I was in
my 20s I would totally be so happy about
this but I'm not excited about this I
don't know what I'm gonna do with these
I think even on a going-out night i
think i would look ridiculous wearing
these so i'll probably put these in my
giveaway box for another time and then
see if somebody wants them at some point
if i have a young younger person went in
the giveaway i'll throw these in there
something but not excited about that at
all for me personally for my age so the
last thing is the last thing no there's
two things and these two things I'm
actually extremely excited about this
right here is a Mirabella face primer
and if you are not familiar with this
then you need to get familiar with this
because this is an amazing face primer I
actually got this i think in an Ipsy bag
a long long long long long time ago and
I like cried the day that I ran out of
this of course I never reversed it
because i have so many so many so many
face primers and i just never came
across it in a convenient way but this
is an amazing face primer it's got that
gel consistency let me show you kind of
like the smashbox primer it's got that
gel but it's just so smooth to the touch
I mean it just feels so silky and
amazing and it doesn't feel so silicon
II that you just feel like your face is
plasticky it just really moisturizes
almost your skin and it just gives your
skin just this beautiful silky feel
makeup does last longer when I use this
I remember absolutely loving this primer
so I'm so excited to have another one of
these and this tube will last forever if
I use this every day I they'll probably
last me at least six months even if I
used it every single day because you
have to use so little of it all over
your face so
super happy and excited about this if
you got this in your box eat ramen you
are not sure of the magical pneus yet it
is magical you are going to love it I
bet if you don't I would be shocked
alright the last thing in here is
something I have never seen before I
thought it was very interesting it is a
full sized heart prod product which is
always very exciting to see this is
America Gibran Singh serum I was sitting
there thinking the first thing I thought
when I opened this almost like bronzing
serum I think my dark skinned friends
are not going to be happy about a
bronzing zero but then I read the
description and it says hydrates an even
skin tone so then I was thinking well
maybe this will be great for my darker
skin friends because it would even out
skin tone I have not had a chance to use
the shed I'm currently testing some skin
care products for the sampled out
hashtag on Instagram that my friend
Mandy is doing feel free to join us on
sample now on Instagram you just hashtag
sampled out and then you show your
little samples that you're using up I
try to use only one new product at a
time because I don't want to compromise
what's happening with the product I have
not tried the shed but I'm really
excited to try it and it is just it's a
it's an oil which surprised me because
most times when you get a tanning thing
it'll be a cream so I'm very very
curious about this and especially since
it's got that whole maracuya thing going
on and the mayor kucha is really really
nice I'm so excited to try this and see
how this bronzing serum works have you
all ever heard of the tart bronzing
serum I've never heard of that in my
life so just super excited about that
and very thankful to have it and the
full size is forty seven dollars and
this remember this is a $21 subscription
service so forty seven dollars right
here I mean this is already double the
price of the box here plus the amazing
face primer plus the lip product that if
you can get past the smell is very nice
and the lip pencil if you like lip
pencils that there for you and if you're
you know digging on these things this is
here for you I mean for me this is
definitely well over worth the price of
the the box here I mean this itself I
would say for me personally my personal
value i would pay thirty dollars for
this because of the meritage it will and
i know that it's a me
think I don't know if I would personally
pay 47 just because I'm always looking
for a sale I don't know both spent forty
seven dollars on anything like this it's
not because it's not worth it it's just
not worth that much to me so 34 this I
would definitely pay it says the full
slice on this primer is 29 i would pay
20 for this even though it's amazing i
just don't by $29 face primers just I
just don't buy things like that so 24
this i would pay seven dollars for this
just because of the smell aspect of it
mom will say eight because of the
lighted mirror because i do like that so
we'll say i don't know but drugstore
ones yet aight i'm going eight max
because the smell is terrible i
personally would not have purchased this
but you know if it was on sale for three
or four dollars i probably would have
bought it and i wouldn't have bought
this at all so my personal value of
course is definitely well above for boxy
charm the 21 dollar price tag i am again
very very happy with boxxy trauma as
usual so that's the end of my box etrog
