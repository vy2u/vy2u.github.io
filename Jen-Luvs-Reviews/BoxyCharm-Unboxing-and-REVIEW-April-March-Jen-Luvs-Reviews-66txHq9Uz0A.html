again I know some of you really look
forward to these videos every month and
I'm excited to do it for you because
I've got a lot to share with you I dug a
little deeper into the products that
were in the box trouble one product in
particular in marches boxycharm so I'm
gonna go ahead and tell you about that
because some things are really really
interesting and then we're gonna go
ahead and dig into the April boxycharm
so you know what I'll be reviewing next
month so if that sounds good to you hang
tight we're getting into it right now if
you are new to my channel which you may
be I believe we have about 4,000 new
collective brain members over the past
week so thank you so much for
subscribing if you're brand new to my
channel I used to beep years ago
primarily a subscription box review
channel before they were super popular
and since then I have trimmed away down
on my subscription box unboxings I do
just boxycharm which has been sent to me
by boxycharm since their second box of
all time and I also do some if see a
live stream on boxing's and then I do
fabfitfun as a sponsored video but that
is the extent of my subscription box
unboxings but why mine are different is
that I actually review the products for
you and not just show you hey I got this
in the box and hey I got this in the box
and hey I got this in the box which is
my preferred way of filming them not
that there's anything wrong with that
style it's just I feel like it's more
valuable when I give you more
information about the products inside so
even if you don't get boxycharm you'll
still be able to get some benefit from
this video so let's go ahead and talk
about what we got in the March box I
have been trying these products this
month and I've got some very strong
opinions let's start with my favorite
product that was in this box and
definitely the only thing that is a
complete rave from this box and that is
the vintage Cosmetics little eye brush
set as you can see they have been
well-loved
I have been using these babies and I
have really been enjoying them I love
the shape that they gave to they gave
this really nice fluffy crease brush
which I personally really like because
it makes it easy to blend shadows into
the crease it's very very
nice also this brush here this one is
great for packing color onto the lid
which is wonderful and then this little
C smudger brush is nice for getting
detail work lower lash line things like
that and it's been just a wonderful set
for me I've really been enjoying it
they're very very soft and yeah this
these were a huge win oh by the way
those of you that we've got the Elvis
reference from this I don't know how you
did it all right here we go this is what
it says on here step one for the money
step two for the shadow and step three
go girl go there's a huge difference
between that and one for the Money two
for the show three to get ready now go
cat go I don't know how you did it I
don't know how you made that connection
but if you did make the connection
you are a flippin genius and I am very
very impressed with you
now the next product that I thought was
good but not great was the pretty vulgar
make them blush blush in the shade prim
vixen I did try this quite a few times I
can say the lasting power on it was
really really good unfortunately the
shade what seemed a little weird on me
it's just a tad bit too purpley pink I'm
more of a mauve kind of person I really
like those mall shades and this one's
just super super bright and it just
wasn't I don't know it just I know I can
pull it off I know I can do it but I
just don't want to I just don't want to
wear this shade I don't want to so I'm
gonna clean it up pass it on because
this one is just not my personal
preference but the formula itself I
thought was very very nice it was just
the shade I didn't particularly like
also the packaging looks really
beautiful from a distance but it is very
cheap when you hold on to it it's very
cheap plastic and I was just hoping for
you know four such gorgeous a gorgeous
print here I was hoping it would be a
little bit more weighty but I guess
that's how they keep the price point
down so yeah I mean it's it's a nice
formula I just really wish I got in a
different shade and that's just personal
preference this is gonna look gorgeous
on somebody of a different skin tone or
somebody that just likes this shade this
product I am wearing on my eyes today
this is the boxy charm and sure palette
I did talk about this in my monthly
favorites video that I will link down
below I had very low expectations for
this i feel like i've swatched so many
shadows from so many different brands at
this point I feel like through touch and
through swatching I can kind of get an
idea of what the palette is going to be
like and I do feel like it was better
than I expected but not by very much
first of all I don't see a point in
having three peaches in here yes they
have different levels of shine to them
but that's really lame I'm sorry that's
lame the the biggest thing I have with
this is the lasting power is not great
especially without primer I know most of
us that are watching Beauty videos on
YouTube are probably using an eye primer
when I'm testing an eyeshadow palette I
like to do primer on one side and no
primer on the other just to see if the
primer really does make a difference and
it really made a difference with this
palette like I mentioned I am wearing it
on my eyes today and I had a heck of a
time getting the shadows to stay where I
put them I use the smashbox eye primer
which is usually very good for me and
this blue it just keeps going up into my
crease where i don't want it so keep
having to blend this shade into the
crease to try to get the look back it's
like stop moving eyeshadow and I expect
it to listen to me even though it's an
inanimate object it doesn't listen to me
and that's that's why I'm not having fun
with this palette so this palette is
going to be being passed on even though
it's not a bad palette it just it's not
fun for me to use it's too much work
lasting power isn't great and yeah this
one's gonna be a no for me this is
another one that kind of surprised me I
thought this was gonna be straight junk
honestly I looked at the wand on this
and I was like oh no that's a long time
ago I did a Dollar Tree makeup challenge
and the wand on this really reminded me
of that Dollar Tree wand it's very cheap
looking and it just it looks just not
good I have to say it's not good but
it's not as bad as I thought it was
going to be it does give me a little bit
of length not a whole lot of volume this
would be a nice mascara for me for under
false lashes just to kind of color my
lashes so that they end up blending in
with the false lashes but beyond that
this is something that's just not good
for me personally if you already have
long voluminous lashes this may do it
for you for me and my little short
stubby lashes it's a big ol No
and then finally this is the the one
that I really dug into because I was
super curious the brand is called South
Maine and they are gel I pack if you've
never seen an eye gel before it's like a
little plastic key almost like a jell-o
jiggler and you put it underneath your
eye and you let it sit there according
to the directions for 30 minutes it's
supposed to reduce puffiness and dark
circles I told you I was going to show
you some before and after pictures of me
using these so I'm gonna go ahead and
show those to you right now I don't have
puffiness under my eyes and I only have
the littlest bit of discoloration under
my eyes so what did I expect of course
it's not going to really work for me
because I'm not the target audience for
this but I did look into the ingredients
on this and I think this is interesting
even if you're not going to get this
product to kind of apply to other
products so the first ingredient is
water and then glycerine glycerine is a
humectant it pulls moisture out of the
air and into your skin and then we have
something called hydrolyzed of lastin
and this is what I wanted to spend a lot
of time on because I looked into a
topical use of elastin and collagen and
what it comes down to is there's
absolutely no research that says putting
a collagen or elastin topically on your
face will replace it within your skin
these are ingredients that are naturally
occurring in our skin and they help our
skin to be plump they're actually
occurring in lots of parts of our body
but when we think about skincare we're
talking about the skin though after
certain age our collagen production in
our lesson production it definitely goes
down there's no evidence to say that it
can be replaced by just putting
something on your face our skin is not a
change purse okay if you take the money
out you put the money back in you're
good our skin doesn't work that way our
skin felt some things just have to be
produced naturally the information that
I'm giving you right now is from a
website called ScienceDirect and it is a
scientific resource and they are saying
that there is no way to get the elastin
back into your skin through topical
application but people think elastin
elastic it's going to make my skin more
elastic no it's not it's a gimmick it's
not real don't fall for it
it's not real but along with that there
are a couple of good ingredients the
next one is called something called
Tramel a-- fussa formas extract it's
actually a mushroom that's used in a lot
of Asian
skincare what has been shown to do is
hydrate the skin it can also potentially
lighten spots which I guess is where
they get the dark circle erasing thing
and also it helps to heal your skin the
next ingredient is something called Alan
toen and that is another really good
skincare ingredient you see it in all
kinds of skincare there is no evidence
that it helps with anti aging but what
it does do is it helps your skin it kind
of gives your skin a hint like hey we
need to change over that top layer of
skin let's go ahead and do that right
now and it encourages that natural
turnover of the top layer of your skin
which is awesome it also softens your
skin it helps your skin retain moisture
and it's just overall just a really good
ingredient so those are in there but I
do want to warn you there is one thing
in here if you have not used these yet
and you did get them please please
please make sure you wash off this
product after use a lot of face masks
and eye gels you leave it on and this is
something you want to wash off because
of this weird preservative that's in
there this ingredient is called wait for
it methyl ISA thiazole enone yes I did
it this is actually an ingredient that
is was banned in Canada and 2016 from
products that stay on the skin it must
be in a rinse off product in Canada and
the reason why is because it is a skin
sensitizer you plan on purchasing these
please please please make sure you wash
it off after you use it because I would
hate for those skin sensitizing effects
to hurt you in one way or another so
based on all of that craziness my
cosmetic FBI nests do I think this
month's box each ROM was worth it
absolutely not it is my least favorite
boxycharm that i've gotten in a while
the only product that I liked worthy
makeup brushes that was it that is not
worth $21 to me personally it does look
like monetarily those brushes are worth
$21 but if I saw this box on a shelf for
$21 there is no way what I would
purchase it as you can tell them a
little bit disappointed because I
usually love my boxy charms and this one
was just such a huge bust but without
dwelling on that for too long because
we need to cleanse ourselves off of the
negative and we need to embrace the
positive I'm hoping by opening up the
April box I did peek in here but I
didn't do any swatches or anything so
let's go ahead and do those together and
get some first impressions it looks like
we have a cute little card in here which
is different and it talks it gives a lot
of details about the products it's very
beautiful the way they've done this
they're really it's the theme is eye
candy and they have really bumped up
their card and there's also a VIP offer
for dr. Brandt here visiting them at
Sephora search hashtag pores no more to
access a special limited edition pore
refiner primer bundle offer
and then also 10% off at tart with code
April Boxey so there you go if you want
to use that you can use that you don't
have to be a boxycharm subscriber to use
those okay so speaking of that we did
get the tarte pro glow liquid
highlighter let's go ahead and open this
up and this is in the shade sparkler I
do believe I have I did get a sample
size of these this at one point but I
don't think it was in the shade sparkler
so I'm excited to swatch and try this
ooh it's like a bronze whoo that's
really pretty okay it's a little bit
dark for my skin tone but I think we
might be able to work with that I
believe that anybody more pale than me
probably would find this to be a little
too deep but I think it's very nice to
have deeper shades in here for
subscribers that are of deeper skin tone
and I do think this will work
beautifully on a medium to deeper skin
tone and I'm gonna try to get it to work
on me but I will definitely let you know
okay moving on we have the EDS High
Definition a liquid lipstick please be
ashame it is involve give me some Mulva
come on come on big bucks big bucks no
whammies big bucks big bucks no whammies
I can't get it open all right here we go
I'm scared to look okay don't what is it
is it good or is it bad oh it's good yay
for me this is a shade because selfishly
I like the boxes to fit me even though
it is nice for them to fit different
people just I'm selfishly very happy
about this is in what shade I don't know
might say on the box and it doesn't
really okay so it is in mystery shade
apparently I'm gonna have to try to hunt
down before the end of the month what
this shade is called it feels very
glossy feeling like slippy which I'm
very surprised about usually liquid
lipsticks are a little bit more smooth a
little more dry I hope that it's not
sticky I can feel a little bit of a
stick doing this but we will see what
happens with that I will let you know I
am definitely not hating the shade and
the vacuum cleaner pores no more vacuum
cleaner tour purifying mask and this is
something whenever I get pour anything
pour related I always pass it on because
this is a product that was not meant for
me I don't have large pores I don't have
trouble with clogged pores things like
that so I won't be trying this I would
much rather pass it on to somebody that
I think could use it speaking of that if
you think you could use this let's just
do an impromptu giveaway right now if
you'd like to enter the giveaway what
emoji should we do let's do any kind of
happy face emoji whatever happy face
emoji you would like to put also for
those of you that are on laptops and
desktops last time I did this people
didn't know how necessarily how to get
an emoji in the comments if you're on a
laptop I will put directions in the
video description it's very very easy or
you can just type the words smiley face
if you don't feel like going through all
of that and you are entered to win the
pores no more vacuum cleaner and I will
send this out to you after I do my full
review so it's going to be a little
while before I send this out because I
do want to bring this back from my full
review at the end of the month so just
so you know it's gonna be a little while
because I do want to be able to show
this in the video all right next up we
have the brow gal by Tanya crooks
instant brown hair what the instant
brown hair 0 - tinted brow gel with
microfibers okay so let's open this and
see what it looks like ok ok it looks a
little bit light for me one thing about
boxycharm is they don't do like any kind
of quiz or anything to know what your
skin tone is what your hair color is
things like that which they may want to
consider doing they probably just don't
want to deal with
I think that would help a lot for people
to be happier with the products that
they get this one does look pretty light
for me so we will see how that goes I do
like the idea of a brow gel with fiber
so I'll keep you posted and then lastly
there were a few options of color pop
palettes that you could get
I got you had me at hello and should I
try to peel the sticker off to see if
it's got the kathleenlights thing on
there maybe we'll do that for the next
video it's a stay if it's under there it
does have a sticker so it's probably
under there I'm not gonna do it though
well wait until the next video and then
maybe we'll peel it off it does look
kind of messy underneath I guess that
was just from it being knocked around
and shipping I'm not gonna complain as
long as there's no broken shadows I'm
cool with it and it's just a bunch of
mobs and golds and I will definitely be
trying this out it looks it looks okay
it looks alright and my black route and
go no but I mean it looks nice if you've
tried the had me at a low palette by
color pop let me know what you think of
it down in the comments down below
because I'm curious what everyone's
opinion is of this palette I do like the
color scheme on it the color scheme is
very pretty is it anything I haven't
seen before no but it may be very fun to
play with so I'll go ahead and play with
that and I'll let you know so from first
impression looking at this I do think
this does look like it's worth twenty
one dollars I mean just the Chartist pro
glow alone i think would be worth it
adding on the color pop which i'm very
excited to try because part of this is
just the opportunity to try new products
of course I wouldn't have purchased the
the dr. Brandt thing but I know these
are very expensive the brow ghoul I'm
excited to try and then the lip product
I am also excited to try it as a color
that appeals to me so I'm excited about
that so it looks to be worth twenty one
dollars but we will find out in a few
weeks as soon as I can try all this
stuff and get back to you and as soon as
I get my may box oh my gosh I can't
believe it's me already but thank you so
