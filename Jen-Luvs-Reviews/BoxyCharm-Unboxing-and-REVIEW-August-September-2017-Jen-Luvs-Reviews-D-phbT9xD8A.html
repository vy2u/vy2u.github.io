review of the boxycharm from August and
I will also be showing you my boxy charm
from September I am excited to show you
because boxy charm has really been
putting some super high value items in
there $21 box and I don't know how
they're doing it but it's pretty crazy
as I just mentioned Bakke charm is $21 a
month it is a monthly beauty
subscription service where you get
mostly full sized items occasionally you
get some deluxe samples but it's mostly
full sized items from a lot of both
mainstream brands and indie brands
boxycharm is sent to me for review but
that does not influence my review at all
boxycharm loves me just the way I am
honesty and also speaking of honesty
let's go ahead and give you an honest
review of the August box it does come in
this with this foam base underneath it
but it's really hard to close the box
with the foam base in it because there's
so much stuff in here let me show you
what I got first thing I want to talk
about is the eyelashes that I'm wearing
today these are the pure Pro eyelashes
3d cruelty-free luxe lashes up to 30
times wear okay so they are dramatic
that's something I want to say they are
very very bold so if you're not used to
wearing lashes this may not be the best
pair to try not just because they're
bull but for other reasons as well the
other reason is they do have a very
thick band not a very thick band but a
thick band and I prefer thinner bands
especially for people that are new to
applying lashes because what can happen
with a thick band is they aren't as
flexible as the thin bands and it makes
it a little bit harder to apply the
other thing is boxycharm didn't include
any kind of lash glue so you're gonna
have to go out and purchase lash glue in
order to apply these I wish that there
had been just like a little mini lash
glue in with this so the people that
don't normally wear lashes would have a
way to try the lashes without having to
go purchase something extra so that's
just one critique there they're fine
they do seem to be of high quality they
seem to be lasting very long I've worn
them I think four times now at this
point and they are still they look just
as great as they did when I pulled them
out of the box
and I am enjoying them I just don't
particularly prefer the thicker band and
they are a little dramatic for me next
we got a set of Moda pro brushes if you
don't know Mota is owned by royal and
langnickel motor brushes are sold at
Walmart stores this is their Pro line
they sent us a crease brush a chisel
brush and a pointed blush brush I did
use all of these brushes getting ready
today I did have it filmed and then I
realized I forgot to turn the camera on
like a idiot so I did do a demo of these
brushes but let me just kind of give you
a quick rundown this one right here the
crease brush is great for fluffing
product into the crease I find that
because it is not a very dense brush it
picks up just a little bit of product so
it's really good for highly pigmented
eyeshadows to blend into the crease or
just to use with no product on it to
blend out your shadows it's a very nice
brush the points at blush brush I use
this for blush today you can also use
this for setting powder you can use it
for bronzer things like that I love the
pointed shape to it because I like a
deep taper on it I like the kind of
bulbous looking brushes because they
pick up a lot of product but because
this one again isn't super super dense
it's nice for more pigmented blushes to
apply and again it's a very nice brush I
like it a lot now this one is very
densely packed this is the chisel brush
and what this is for is to lay down on
the cheeks to chisel out a contour and I
did use that today with a NYX contour
palette with the love contours all
palette and I do like this I like that
there is I'm not sure if you can see but
there's a little tiny dig here that
really helps to hug the cheekbone which
I love a lot but it is very dense so if
you're going to use a very pigmented
contour you definitely want to tap
lightly because it will definitely go on
super super strong with this brush a big
difference between the pro brushes from
Mota and the ones that you can get at
Walmart is that they are heavier they
don't seem to be any kind of different
bristles or anything they just kind of
have that pro weight to them that is
very nice that I personally prefer so
yeah great on the brushes definite win
there next we got a liquid lipstick from
the Beauty crop it is what I'm wearing
on my lips today I honestly I'm not sure
if I'm a big fan of this lip with this
eye but I
did want to show you because it did come
in the box I do like this it is a little
bit dry I can definitely feel it on my
lips throughout the day and it does it
doesn't fade super gracefully in that if
you eat or drink you're definitely gonna
want to reapply because it does wear
away on the inside it's not overly
drying we don't have any stick to it
anymore as it's drying down there is a
little bit of stick to it but I
definitely it's not sticky anymore which
makes me super happy it does dry down
completely Matt it is completely kiss
proof on me um like like I can't get any
product off my lips the the applicator
is a typical doe foot but I found that I
really do like this applied with a lip
brush because the formula is a little
bitter a little bit on the watery your
side even though it does go on fully
opaque just a lip brush I find to apply
this particular formula better but
overall I do like this it's a it's an
average - better than average liquid
lipstick for me personally and my
personal tastes next we got an eyeliner
from Bella Pierre and I haven't had
great luck with Bella Pierre as a brand
I don't think this is a bad eyeliner but
I do find that it's not quite as soft as
I like personally I find it a little bit
difficult to apply on my lid without
having to pull it's definitely not the
worst eyeliner ever I mean not at all I
mean it definitely will apply but it
just kind of takes a little bit more
pulling than I like where time is pretty
typical as far as putting it on the
lower lash line I do see that it does
tend to fall down onto my lower lid
throughout the day which I don't enjoy
so what I've been using this for is on
the upper lash line
it doesn't smoke out super well though
and because of that I don't really care
for this liner because if I'm gonna put
it on my upper lash line I want to be
able to smoke it out some and it's take
so it just takes a little work because
the formula is a bit stiff in the end
it's just kind of an average pencil
liner nothing out of the ordinary
amazing and the last thing that they
gave which was the big oh my gosh in
here is the Tarte rein force of the sea
volume 2 eyeshadow palette I am wearing
it on my eyes today again I did have a
demo that I was doing and for God's
the record button I do like the way that
it came out I feel like this is a good
eye shadow palette I am not the biggest
fan of tartar shadows overall and this
kind of falls into that I feel like with
the shimmery shades you really do need
to apply with a fingertip or a sponge
tip applicator if that's your thing with
a brush they don't really apply great as
far as the overall pigmentation
especially the lighter shades the darker
shades will play a little bit better but
they are kind of patchy so if you want
that full opacity you really need to use
a fingertip if you're just blending a
little bit of product you can definitely
use a brush with these these are all
shimmer shadows so in order to anchor
the look I did need to pull mattes from
another palette just to kind of give me
that matte transition things like that
the matte brow bone shade but overall I
mean it's a good palette it's a good
palette I am happy to have it but it's
definitely not one that I'm gonna reach
for a lot so overall was this worth $21
to me monetarily it is definitely worth
well over $21 and I think for you it's
gonna be how much will you use this
eyeshadow palette I think is what is
going to push it over the edge for you
for me I don't think this was worth $21
for me the only thing I'm excited about
is the brush set as far as everything
else I could have taken or done without
kind of thing I think the eyeshadow
palette like I said is really gonna push
it over or under for you whether you
like the color scheme things like that
because the eyeliner is kind of math the
liquid lipstick is good the eyelashes
it's really gonna depend on you I was
really excited at first about this box
but then the more I got in and the more
I tried things that kind of a less
excited that I was for everything so
overall this was kind of a want-want box
for me and it's just because of personal
preference not because boxycharm didn't
try to put a lot of high value items in
here because they totally did so now
that I've given you my full review of
the August box let's go ahead and show
you what I got in September that I will
be reviewing at the end of next month
first thing I see in here is the studio
makeup luminous loose blush it says a
silky lightweight blush that gives a pop
of healthy radiance to the cheeks and I
am excited about this I did hear good
things from my friends in my facebook
group which is facebook.com slash group
slash what's a
make up they said great things about it
so I am excited to try it I'm having
trouble opening it what is happening
here what is happening this does look
like a shade that I would definitely
enjoy it's kind of a peachy shade which
i think is beautiful going into fall so
I'm excited to try that
next is the Brio geo don't despair
repair deep conditioning mask I have
used this I've tried this multiple times
and it's not intense enough for my hair
my hair needs something with a lot more
with a lot more pizazz with a lot more
hydration and this just isn't enough for
me if you have oily hair then maybe this
would be a good one for you but for me
and my thin dry hair it's just not
enough so I'm not really excited about
that and I probably will just pass that
on to someone who will enjoy it more we
also got a colour-pop liquid lipstick
this is an ultra satin lip in the shade
little strategist at Aegis I don't know
that word I feel like I got a pretty
good vocabulary and I don't know that
word and it is a milky baby pink which
is not a shade that I normally wear what
I'll probably try to do with this is top
it over other lipsticks actually let's
go ahead and do that let's top it right
over what we've got and see if we can
calm this lipstick down a little bit
because it's a little crazy that is
opaque
well that was interesting if you ever
get a liquid lipstick in one of these
subscription boxes is either too light
or too dark for you consider mixing it
with other lipsticks and liquid
lipsticks that you currently own because
you really can make use of these and
this is something I know I will never
wear on its own I don't think we'll try
it but I'm very skeptical I do like it
talked over this one though I think it
looks pretty next we got the bare
minerals perfecting face brush I did own
this at one point and I do believe I
declared it this was marketed with their
serum foundation when it first came out
it was stupid expensive it was one of my
biggest regret buys because I just
didn't see anything fabulous about it
it's not a bad brush in any way but it's
got like this little divot hole in there
to drip the serum in and it just I just
thought it was very overpriced for what
it was but if you're getting this in a
boxycharm I mean that's pretty awesome
because it is a good brush it's just at
full price it was like oh my gosh why
did I do that to myself it was just a
big regret buy I am happy to see it in a
box of charms I think people that use it
will really enjoy it and the last thing
in here is the pure soirÃ©e diaries
eyeshadow palette and it looks like this
I have used it one time so far I can
tell you it was not a good experience I
actually ended up covering up the look
completely with other shadows because I
really didn't like it so I am going to
have to try this at least one or two
more times to see if I can make it work
but so far this is going to be a huge
note for me which makes me sad because
I've heard great things about pure
eyeshadows and this one is not living up
to that hype so far but we will see next
month so I want to thank you so much for
