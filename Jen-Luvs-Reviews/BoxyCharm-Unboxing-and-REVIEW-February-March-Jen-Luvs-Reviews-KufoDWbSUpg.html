subscription boxes usually boxycharm is
one of the ones that stands out as being
people's favorites but this is the way I
feel about it I feel like any
subscription box anything you're getting
in a mystery it has to be worth it to
you as an individual based on the
products that are in it whether you're
getting a monetary value out of it or
not if you're not going to use the
products then there's no point so what
I'm gonna do for you today is we are
going to go over all of the products
that were in the February box I'm gonna
give you full reviews on everything
except for one thing well it's kind of a
full review but I'll get to that in a
minute and the other thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna go over at the March
box so that you'll know what I'll be
reviewing next one so if that sounds
good to you
hang tight we're getting into it right
now you do not know boxycharm is twenty
one dollars a month so it is an
investment but if you are a makeup
junkie if you like trying new things
then this may be something you might be
interested in getting a beginning
boxycharm for years and years and years
and years and years from boxycharm they
do send it to me in PR or in public
relations if that means that I don't pay
for it but they know that I'm always
going to be honest about the box
they've loved me since the beginning so
there's no question about whether I
would give my honest opinion they
already know this about me and this is
not a sponsored video I'm not getting
paid by boxycharm for this video
now that all of the disclaimers are done
let's go into what we got or what I got
in my February box now they are doing a
little bit of variations in the
different boxes you can actually go to
boxycharm as a non subscriber and check
out and see all of the offerings that
they had in boxycharm for any past month
now I do have one sad story and my sad
story is is that I have misplaced the
highlighter palette I will put a picture
of it right here for you I did try it
and then I did some reorganizing and
somehow it got lost you know sometimes
when you organize things you move things
from the messy spot and you then you
forgot where I put it and I look for it
for about thirty minutes before this
video started and I can't find it but I
can tell you my feelings on it and I did
feel that it was very pigmented I
don't prefer most of the shades as
highlights I actually really like them
as an eyeshadow palette and Naked
cosmetics for me is very very strong in
their eyeshadow formula and that's
that's the way I personally prefer to
use it so I personally think that it was
great to get in the box I really really
liked it a lot and I'm very sorry that I
can't physically show it to you but yeah
very happy to see this in boxycharm and
I do feel like if you're gonna use these
kinds of colors for eyeshadow that it
may make the full box for you because it
really was is wherever it may be a
really good eye shadow palette for me
next up are these crown brushes now you
might already be able to see they're
there they weren't cut very well there's
some little stray hairs in a few of the
brushes this one just fell out I haven't
washed them yet I find these to be
pretty mediocre brushes I had some
trouble with the eyeshadow brush it's
fine
but I don't feel it picks a product all
that well I feel like I really need to
pack and build and pack and building I
think it's because this brush is very
very fluffy and along with being fluffy
it's not very dense there aren't a ton
of bristles in here so the products kind
of it's almost like a blending brush but
it's too flat to be a Brandt blending
brush it like kind of doesn't know what
it wants to be so I don't really like
this brush much these I liked better
I've been using this one for packing
powder underneath my eyes and this has
been working very well for that that's
really all I can see using this for
except for maybe highlight but it's too
small for contour for me too small for
blush too big for us shadow it's another
one it's just a weird shape this one I
find to be the most functional the blush
brush I do like brushes that are this
shape this is why I'm happy to have I
feel like it picks up product nicely and
applies it very nicely for a nice wash
of color on the cheek so this works
really well with pigmented blushes
because it again it's not super dense at
the tip it's very it's dense at the
bottom but at the tip where it picks up
the product it's not super dense so I
will be using this as far as the design
of them I feel like they look a little
bit cheap in that the ferrule is clearly
separated kind of halfway down the brush
it just I don't prefer these brushes I
definitely like other brushes better I
love my motor brushes I love my Luxy
brushes I love
Sigma brushes these are ones that I
don't particularly prefer for the naked
palette I have the outer packaging just
can't find the products this is one that
you have heard me complain about if you
watched my monthly favorites video this
is the cover effects shimmer veil and
what I what you really need to know
about this is it's a veil you can see
right through it it's not an opaque
product at least for me when I did try
to build it up like I said in my
favorite spin fails video it crackled on
me I think I built it up too much I just
find it difficult to work with for the
price point even though this is a very
expensive product if you buy retail I
didn't I don't think I'm gonna be
continuing to use this I think I'm gonna
pass this on to a friend because I have
applied it with the DOE foot applicator
put it back in so I'm gonna pass this on
to a friend that doesn't mind that I've
dabbed into it I know exactly who I'm
giving it to so a marina if you're
watching this I'm bringing it over on
Tuesday products that I did really like
was the makeup geek nude pencil I don't
like the Chi said this multiple times I
don't like when brands name color this
shade nude because everybody is a
different color when they're nude and
this just it irks me but if there was a
range of nude if they had like nude
medium nude deep nude I would feel a lot
happier about it but besides the name of
it it is a very nice product it is by
makeup geek it's very creamy what I use
this for is to brighten up the waterline
and it works very very well for that for
just really making my eyes open up
sometimes I just use it right in the
inner tear-duct and it just kind of
opens my eyes and I love it the lasting
power on it is really good it will last
me through a day it does kind of fade in
my waterline a bit but it does stay on
the lash line so and that's pretty
typical for me it's very rare that I can
get a product to actually last in my
waterline because it's constantly
watering darn waterline doesn't it know
I'm trying to keep color on it but yeah
overall really good product really like
this love makeup geek as a brand in
general and then the last thing is
actually on my eyes today it's the
sparkly bits that are on my eyes this is
the bellapierre and it is called sparkle
and it's just a loose glitter really
like this a lot for what it is you
definitely need a glitter glue for it
or else it just falls everywhere there's
no adhesion at all on its own you need a
glitter glue I could see people tapping
it onto the collarbone I personally
wouldn't put it on my lips because it
does have kind of a sandy texture so I
don't I don't prefer that but I do love
it on my eyes I think it's very very
pretty and it's fun so this is
definitely a win for me now if I had to
say if this box was worth $21 to me I
would say yes just based on these two
products the one that I have misplaced
and the bellapierre glitter both of
these to me are worth $21 I feel like
this is probably worth it for me if I
saw it for $15 I'd be like yeah score
and if I saw this for five or six
dollars I would be happy with that as
well and then adding in the makeup geek
liner I think that this is definitely if
I saw this for six dollars I would be
very very happy so definitely worth with
these three products the price of the
box even if I take out the other
products I think that's one good thing
about boxycharm is they give so many big
products that even if you don't love
everything in the box even if you love
just a couple of things it's usually for
me at least worth a $21 price tag all
right you ready to see what we got in
march or what I got in March let's get
into that right now so this is the March
box I did peek I peeked I was bad I
couldn't help it but it is watch
anything yet so I want to just watch it
with you this was the first thing I saw
in there it's a pretty girl pretty girl
pretty vulgar make them up blush blush
and this is in the shade of frim vixen
and the packaging on line looks a lot
more luxe but it is plastic so I guess
at the price point they wouldn't really
be able to do a metal packaging like
this
but it mean it's gorgeous it's just when
you get up close it looks kind of cheap
I hate to say that but from far
away for as a display piece it's
beautiful now this is a very vibrant
vibrant pink we'll see how it swatches a
swatch is very vibrant this is something
I'm gonna have to apply with a very
light hand I don't typically wear purple
toned pink blushes they're just not my
style so worst case I will pass it on to
my friend that has a deeper skin tone I
think this would look gorgeous on her
but for me this is probably not going to
work out as far as the shade goes
it does seem like it's quite pigmented
so we shall see on that next we got a
bellapierre volumizing mascara let's go
ahead and open that up and check out the
wand bellapierre I just I feel like it's
a lot of misses for me everyone smile I
get a hit like the glitter on my eyes
today I do really like but I never get
super excited when I see Belle appear
alright this is I can tell already this
is probably not going to work well for
me just from the shape of the wand I
know that sounds very very judgmental
but I'm being judgey that's my job as
reviewer but I'll tell you for sure next
month the bristles are way too far
spread apart I always have trouble with
brushes like this actually doing
anything on my lashes I find a lot of
very inexpensive wands like from the
Dollar Tree when I did a Dollar Tree
challenge a long time ago the mascara
wands were exactly like this me when I
see a blonde like this I think very very
cheap and not well made but that I'm
going to give it a good college try I'm
not giving up on it yet but I can tell
you I do not have high hopes for this
this is very very cute this is the
vintage cosmetics smokey eye brush set
the packaging is really adorable these
are cute
so one thing is I have been the more I
have been working on my makeup skills
the more I've been appreciating these
little tiny smudge your bus's brushes I
used to never use these but what I've
been using these for recently is to get
all the way at the top of my lid trying
not to get the product in my crease so
I've been really appreciating these
little C brushes little smudge of
brushes recently and then this here is
very nice as well this is going to be
for packing on color it feels very
synthetic but it doesn't feel pokey at
all but again very small which I do like
and this is also nice for people with
smaller lids as well ok and then this
one is going to be for blending which
will be nice it's kind of an angled
fluffier blending brush so just notice
that they have numbers on them this one
says step 1 for the money
this one says step 2 for the shadow okay
and this is step 3 go go girl
go girl go I don't quite get the
references I'll have to maybe look on
their website and see
I can figure out the references but they
do look like look like a very nice brush
set they feel good they don't have a
particularly heavy weight or anything to
them but I really do think they are very
promising looking and I will be back
next month to let you know I gels are or
gels are not usually my favorites these
are the South main three gel pack they
were supposed to reduce puffiness reduce
dark circles and moisturize the under
eye area the reason why I don't prefer
these as I do find them to be overpriced
typically for what they are because they
are one-time used like face masks where
I would personally rather get an eye
cream that cost 30 or 40 dollars it's
going to last me a very long time rather
than with single time use things it's
nice the same thing with with face masks
the directions say on here to use
promptly after opening for best results
used for three consecutive days so
that's what we will do I will take
before and after pictures for you so we
can see if there's any results from
these and then the last thing in here
I've been seeing some people with
pictures on Instagram of their use of
this is the boxy charm and pure
eyeshadow palette it looks very very
nice pure eyeshadows for me I have been
pretty good I've been enjoying them so
when I swatch them they feel let's see
mmm that feels very chalky oh no mmm
let's fill these yeah they don't feel of
high quality unfortunately I just have
this there's like this feel of cheap
Chinese eyeshadow well look at that
though that's really pretty just to the
touch they don't feel fabulous that like
for example this peach one up here feels
a little powdery but it's really gonna
take some putting on the eyes to see
whether this would be a good quality
palette or not if you've tried any of
these products already in your boxycharm
or if you've ever tried any of these
products in general I would love to know
your thoughts in the comments below so
but first impression just from like
fingers watching them I have a feeling
this is gonna be a relatively mediocre
palette but I'm going to a once again
I'm gonna give it a good college try
we're gonna be fair and we're gonna see
whether this is good or not so we've
done everything that is everything that
I got in my March box and again make
sure you subscribe if you're not already
subscribed to make sure you don't miss
the video for next month when they have
learned
about YouTube as YouTube has decided not
to notify subscribers of all videos
they're subscribed to so for example
let's say out of my nine videos a week
you only watch two because you're not
watching my content every single day
they may just not notify you when my
videos go live so if you want to make
sure you are notified you can hit the
bell down next to the subscribe button
and then you'll make it'll make sure
that you are notified and you can turn
off your email settings if you don't
want an email if you just want notified
when you log on to YouTube you can turn
all of that off in your settings if you
want to but that way it makes sure that
you do get that in your subscription
feed make sure you do that with
everybody that you really want to know
when their content goes alive it's it's
a real thing I know I turn on
notifications for all the channels that
I want to make sure that I watch every
single time they upload those of you
then do watch a lot of my content thank
you so much for being here
I truly appreciate it we all have busy
lives we have things to do and just the
fact that you want to take time out of
your day to hear what I have to say
really means so much to me mad love to
you I appreciate you and I will see you
in a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
