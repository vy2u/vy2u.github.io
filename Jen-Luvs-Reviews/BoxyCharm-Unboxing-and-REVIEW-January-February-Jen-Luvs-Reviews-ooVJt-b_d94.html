though it's supposed to be last month
but this month for boxycharm if you've
never been to one of my box of charm
videos before we do it a little
differently here
we do a review of the previous month's
box so you can know all about those
products even if we don't get boxycharm
and we unbox the current box so we know
what is gonna be reviewed next month in
this case at the end of this month I
hope if that sounds interesting to you
hang tight we're gonna get into it right
now so as you know it is the beginning
of March unfortunately I did not receive
my February boxycharm until very very
late in February so I couldn't film it
until now but I have to tell you I had a
lot of information to give you about the
January boxycharm which I have tried to
death oh my gosh but just a little
disclaimer I do get boxycharm as a PR
sample which means I do not pay for it
but I feel like I'm really good at
putting that on the side and thinking
about this as if I had paid for it and
that's usually validated in the comments
below in the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness it is a $21 a month a
subscription and it is always worth over
$100 in a full size products which is
pretty stinkin amazing but the most
important thing beyond what retail value
isn't in here is whether you or I or
both of us whether we would actually use
the things that are in this box because
if we wouldn't use the things in the box
then it's not worth the $21 so let's go
ahead and see what was in January so we
can decide this is a grande Lips
hydrating lip plumper
I love the formula on this it is very
it's got a really nice wash of color to
it it's not sticky it's not overly heavy
it feels really good on the lips but the
smell is terrible and I think that I
might have gotten a bad one because I
did put this very low down in my monthly
favorites countdown that I will put in
the description box down below it's my
favorite video to film all month is my
monthly favorites this was in it and I
talked about the smell on how it smells
like plastic like almost like milled
we plastic it smells awful but most of
the comets if not all of the comments
underneath that video people said that
there's don't smell bad so I may have
gotten a bad one but I didn't realize it
until I posted that video and got all of
those comments so I'm gonna be talking
to the Boxee try mine oh maybe they'll
be able to send me another one because I
do really really like it but I don't
want to use it if it's bad the product
clicks out on the bottom which I really
like so can dispense the perfect amount
of product for me I do really like the
rubber tip applicator I find it to be
very comfortable but I can't even smell
it from here
it just smells horrible so hopefully if
boxycharm because box rubs really good
at sending me replacements for things
and I've heard they're very good at
sending replacements for other people so
I'm hoping I'm really hoping they'll be
able to send me a replacement for this
because it smells really really this was
one that I had really high hopes for and
I do like it I just don't like it as
much I thought I would this is the
Porsche no more illuminizer primer by
dr. Brandt and what I was expecting from
this was almost like when you add like a
beauty whale or something like that to a
foundation how it gives like this really
pretty luminous kind of look to the skin
without looking oily I didn't find this
to do that for me all I found was that
it was just a very nice primer but it
didn't really get that luminizing effect
so do I like it yes absolutely I really
really like it but I was hoping for more
of the luminescence the packaging is
really do you do I'm noticing as I'm
getting older that my skin just doesn't
look as fresh as it once did it's
looking a little bit more flat when I'm
not wearing makeup so this will be nice
to use on an on makeup day just to make
my skin look a little bit more youthful
and not Dewey but just youthful looking
and the way that it used to look this
was when I was actually quite scared of
when I first watched it this is the pure
bronze and brightened dreamer palette
the colours in this are insanely bright
and pigmented what I found I liked this
most for is not on the cheeks but on the
eyes it makes for beautiful beautiful
eye shadow but if you're not into bright
orange eyeshadow then you may not be
able to use it for that
what I also have done is dusted this
lightly onto the cheeks at least these
two shades this one is pretty orange
though so if you don't like an orange
blush it's it's not
it's still gonna look orange the
highlight shade is definitely a win it's
absolutely beautiful but really I don't
feel like these two look great on my
skin even though I feel like I can kind
of get away with it a little bit I just
it's not my personal preference so I
think I'm gonna be using this more for
eyeshadow them for cheek except for the
highlighter which I think can be doubled
as both so this is not a win necessarily
but again not something terrible I was
so excited for this palette so excited
when I saw this in here this is the glam
metals eyeshadow palette by Crown Pro
and what I said in the unboxing video
for this is it reminded me of hit
Parader if you are a child of the 80s
and 90s you will probably remember that
the hair bands and hit Parader this just
looks like that it's like Aerosmith you
know like in the heat of Aerosmith Bob
this way so this way you know what I
mean like that like oh sweet out of mine
you know what I mean like that kind of
feeling it just gave me that that like
vibe and I love it mmm that being said
the lasting power on this was not very
good for me I use it with multiple
eyeshadow primers and I just find that
the shadows muddy together throughout
the day it can provide a nice pretty
look to start I feel like the starting
look is good but it really only lasts
about six hours before I see my shadow
is kind of muddying into something that
is just not very cute so I might keep
this just because I really really like
the packaging a lot and I think it's so
adorable but I really don't think I'm
gonna be using this honestly like I just
I have an emotional attachment of this
because I just have an emotional
attachment to this period of time but I
don't have an emotional attachment to
the quality of the eyeshadows if that
makes sense and the last product in here
I actually didn't open and because I
already own it this is the it cosmetics
brow power a universal eyebrow pencil I
have a mini this is a full size in here
but I'm not even going to open this
because I would hate to waste it because
I already know that I am NOT a fan of
this product and the reason why is I
don't find the formula to be soft enough
for me at
like a brow pencil really needs to have
that happy medium between hard and soft
it can't be so soft that it mushes into
the brows and creates a mess but it
can't be too hard and then it feels like
it rips out my brows I feel like this is
one that rips out my brows it does have
a spoolie on the ends but it's just the
formula it just takes too much I mean
this one is probably a year old so the
one that's in the container probably is
better than this one but it just takes
scrubbing to get the color on one thing
I do appreciate about this is that it is
a universal taupe shade in that you can
do it very lightly and make it be more
for blonds and then darken it up for
brunettes and I think that a blonds may
like this more because you don't have to
press as hard but for me and my super
super dark hair I feel like I need to
press too hard it takes too much work
and I just really don't like this
product but this was the only product in
the box that I actually just didn't like
at all at all now comes the question was
this worth $21 mm if this didn't smell
bad I would say yes because I feel like
this primer is probably worth most of
the value of the box because I do find
it to be an effective face primer and
then it makes my makeup last longer
my foundation goes on beautifully over
top of it I really really like this a
lot so this is probably I mean
monetarily worth way more than the box
itself but I like to get at least two
things in the box that I'm crazy about
in order to say that it's worth $21 I
don't know that's just that's just my
mental state on it the Grande lips again
I I'm really hoping that it's just mine
that smells bad but I really love the
formula on that this I had high hopes
for unfortunately it let me down the
pure palette I like for an eyeshadow
purpose but I don't like it for a cheek
purpose I think that this definitely is
a nice addition but I wouldn't have
purchased this but thankful to have it
and then the brow powder a pencil is
definitely a no for me so so yeah I mean
I think it's worth $21 but it's
definitely not my favorite boxycharm of
all time please don't forget to leave
your thoughts about these products down
in the comments below because we are the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
this isn't just about me this is about
your
voice as well and what you think about
things and everyone reading what you
have to say as well so that we can get a
nice rounded opinion on things not just
one opinion but many many many many many
opinions so let's go ahead and get into
the February box and I'll tell you what
I think of that from first impression
and that's what's gonna be reviewed next
month
this I just sliced open the bottom but I
have not gone through it yet so this is
gonna be a very much a reaction and I'm
already having a little bit of a
reaction looking at this because Naked
Cosmetics is I think one of the most
underrated brands out there they're
single eyeshadows are fantastic
I do also enjoy their press shadows so
I'm really excited to see this and of
course hollow packaging hollow packaging
what else do I need to say it just
brings joy to my heart ah so this is an
a so what is this this is a wood what is
this this is considered a highlight
palette it looks like it's the same kind
of idea as the Kat Von D Alchemist I
just got up and grabbed mine so we could
kind of see how they look next to each
other as far as the shades and things I
mean they are quite different it also
reminds me of the anastacio Beverly
Hills one that's similar to this I have
the I believe the dupe palette for it by
face candy that was sent to me by shop
hush so I'm curious to see the
comparison between these two even though
I don't have the honest oz no one kind
of seeing you know how these compare
because this is ten dollars versus I
think this is $40 retail and of course
you can see the the size of the pans is
huge but it's all about the quality as
well and whether you're getting what
you're paying for here so I'm really
excited because I do love Naked
cosmetics and very excited to try that
out I think I said excited like nine
times because Alma sided oh okay all
right there okay there by crown crown
brushes are kind of hit and miss for me
sometimes I feel like they just aren't
effective but these are pretty I'll give
them that
they're pretty okay they are very very
soft this is gonna be a nice blush brush
I do appreciate the little dig here for
holding it it always makes me feel happy
when they've got those little digs in
there I think crown brush does that very
very well this one I would probably use
for highlight I don't think I would use
this for contour because I feel like it
would just it maybe to apply the contour
but I probably wouldn't have trouble
blending contour with it and then this
would be an eyeshadow shader brush for
me which I do enjoy brushes like this
for that and they're just so so pretty
in color I don't particularly like that
the ferrule looks so separate from the
rest of it I wish that they had figured
out a way to kind of blend that together
because I think it makes it look more
cheap but we will try these and we will
see how it goes and I will let you know
ooh
cover effects what boxycharm going for
the gold your hmm cover effect
shimmervale whoo this is an amethyst so
it looks like you can use this on the
eyes but you can use it anywhere on the
face I need to swatch it it doesn't look
to be very opaque for the eyes it looks
like it's got a lot of glitter in it I'm
actually a little bit this is a what is
happening here it's like it's blending
away what see if I can build it up not
really not quite sure what I'm gonna do
with this it's definitely a little too
sheer for the eyes for me at least from
first impression but we'll have to try
it right now I'm wearing the pop star
cosmetics mesmerized eyeshadow all over
my lid that was what I was expecting
from this but mmm no no it looks like it
might be a better cheek product than an
eye product we'll have to see I'll play
with it makeup geek yeah make a peak
eyeliner pencil okay I've tried make a
peak eyeliner pencils I really do like
them but I don't really use eyeliner
pencils a whole lot let's see oh you
know what I'm happy about this because I
didn't realize it was one of those
waterline ones I misplaced the NYX one
that I had I had the NYX I forget what
it's called I had that and I misplaced
it and now I have another one ooh now
I'm excited because of the shade I was
looking for it the other day because I
was copying a look by Nikki Murphy her
New Year's
look because I was going to New York
City and it called for the pencil for
the waterline and I couldn't find mine
so where was this where were you what I
needed you a few days ago in the mail
apparently and then the last thing in
here is from bellapierre and it just
called sparkle and it just looks like a
loose glitter I'm scared to say this is
hollow I'm scared it might be because I
do see rainbows reflective but I don't
know if those individual little glitter
pieces are a specific color and they
just put those individual glitter pieces
in there to make it look like it was
hollow when it wasn't really hollow
hashtag possibly fake hollow I don't
know but we're gonna play with it and
we're gonna see and it definitely looks
like it's gonna need a glitter glue so
we're gonna need that that is definitely
going to be happening so from first
impression this definitely looks like
it's going to be worth twenty one
dollars especially if this is amazing
we've got the brushes we've got the
eyeliner I'm a little nervous that this
isn't gonna be any good which makes me
sad and then the glitter but then if
you're one of those natural kinds of
people that doesn't like Unicorn kinds
of things then maybe you're not gonna
get a whole lot of use out of this maybe
just the the eye pencil you could use
the brushes you could use but after that
I don't know if there's much you could
use in here if you only use more natural
toned colors so I don't know we'll have
to see next month
make sure you don't miss that by hitting
