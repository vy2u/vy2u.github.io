review for the month we've got the July
box review and the August box unboxing
coming at you right now if you don't
know anything about boxycharm box each
arm is $21 a month it is full of almost
always full size products I haven't had
a boxycharm worth monetarily less than
$100 in a very very long time it is many
people's favorite subscription box for a
very good reason I personally love my
boxycharm this is sent to me for review
but that never influences my review at
all I have definitely not like some of
my boxy charms in the past and of course
some of them I love I just tell you what
I think as if I paid the $21 for it in
case you're curious what's on my face
because I get that question a lot in
these videos on my eyes is the Anastasi
a subculture palette the demo for this
look is in my subculture review I will
link that down below on my lips is the
stay matte liquid lip color in Rossetto
from Rimmel London alright let's go
ahead into the July box and tell you
what I thought of everything we're gonna
start with my absolute favorite thing
the blink eyes shadow palette this is
the electric eyes palette it says that
it was made specifically for boxycharm I
brought this with me when I went when I
travel to Iceland and this is what I use
mainly on my eyes everyday in Iceland
and this is a fabulous eyeshadow palette
I have no complaints about it it is
beautiful it swatches beautifully it
wears beautifully it's just a really
great eyeshadow formula the only thing
is you're definitely gonna need some
kind of matte to anchor the look down
because these are all shimmers I would
imagine pretty much anybody watching
this video is gonna have some kind of
matte transition shade some kind of
matte brow bone shade to help bring this
together but gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
would love to try more of these blank
eyeshadows I've only ever tried their
mascaras before so I was pleasantly
surprised by how much I loved this
bareMinerals invisible light palette
this is the translucent powder duo you
have a
and then you have a glow so this is a
matte translucent powder here and this
is glow the matte powder I liked it
wasn't fabulous but I do like it it's a
good matte powder I wouldn't have paid
full price for this there's no way I
didn't really like the highlight at all
it was a little too subtle for me and it
just didn't have enough oh look it kind
of disappeared into my face so the this
was kind of a note for me especially for
the retail price which is $32 I would
have been upset if I paid $32 for this
because I didn't find this to be useful
at all
alright the setting spray he's our last
month's boxycharm unboxing and review
you saw me try this project beauty spray
set go makeup setting spray the sprayer
on this just oh I have a texture thing
with sprays on my face it's just it
looks like it sprays pretty evenly but
it's very globby and it doesn't feel
good on my face so I have to tell you I
did not use this after that video I have
to admit to you I didn't use it I
couldn't bring myself to use it I would
look at it and I would get like a little
nauseous and then I would just put it
down as far as set there's a very mild
watery kind of scent almost like like
tap water that's been sitting around for
a while kind of scent but it's not
offensive in any way I just and I'm
sorry I can't speak to how well this
works because it's just not my thing
this is gonna have to get passed on to
somebody because it's not my thing
different people got different lipsticks
from colour-pop I believe this is the
colour-pop ultra satin lip and lock
diary I do like the ultra satin lip
formula better than the ultra matte lip
this shade is a little too wow for my
everyday use this is more of a filming
lipstick for me just because it's just a
little little crazy a lot out of my
comfort zone as far as that but it is
nice I am happy to have it I didn't find
it to be shrieky or overly drawing it's
a little drawing but not overly drawing
and I like it I like it I think it's
worth the 6 bucks maybe 7 and then the
last thing in here was the eyebrow
pencil this is by winkie luxe
I like that it is pulling on the ends I
like the packaging I did find that I had
to kind of scrub this onto my brows it's
a little too hard than my preference I
don't like a brow pencil to be too soft
and feel all jelly and my eyebrows but I
don't like it to be too hard any either
and this was a little too hard for me it
just I don't know I didn't really like
it unfortunately it just was too it felt
those gonna rip my eyebrows out I'd
press so hard for it maybe I got a bad
one I don't know but I didn't like it so
overall was this worth $21 to me yes it
was if nothing else then for this I
would pay $21 just for the sighs shadow
palette easy retail price is $45 I don't
know if I would pay 45 for it but I
would I think I would pay 30 that would
be where I would leave it 30 is my top
on that I paid $10 for the matte powder
here the lipstick I would keep that with
the six or seven dollars and the other
products I wouldn't use it all but we're
definitely beyond that $21 price point
so this box is a definite win for me
great job boxycharm so now let us get
into the August box we had gotten a
really cool spoiler and I was very
excited to find it in here this is the
tarte reagan force of the sea volume 2
eyeshadow palette i did use this one
time it was just okay from that one time
but i definitely want to use it more
before the review next month it looks a
lack of ease and yeah it's it's on
discount right now if you're interested
in purchasing this I think Tarte has it
on discount other places have it on
discount it's in the middle of you know
kind of going out which I guess is how
boxycharm got into the boxes but yeah so
far so good not so great but so good
I'll keep you posted
I've been waiting to use these these are
the cure Pro eyelashes their 3d
cruelty-free luxe lashes up to 30
where's so excited to wear these I'm
currently addicted to the ones that NYX
had sent me as part of a PR package
that's what I'm wearing on my eyes today
the wicked lashes really really liked
them a lot so I'm curious to see how
these pure ones are gonna keep up with
my NYX ones because if the Nexxus are
better the Nyx's are cheaper and the NYX
isn't gonna keep getting bought well
they're going to get bought after these
work anymore I'm going to buy more next
up motor brushes y'all know how much I
love my motor brushes this is the motor
brush Pro set you get a pointed blush
brush a chisel brush and a crease brush
and I love my motor brushes they're very
affordable and they're very high quality
and I love them I love motor brushes so
I'm always happy to see motor brushes in
here and I don't think I have these at
all I might have the crease brush but I
don't think I have the pointed blush or
the chisel so these are new ones to me
next we got a bellapierre gel eyeliner
can't say I'm too excited about this I'm
not a big pencil eyeliner person I have
a bunch of them and I don't use them
very often I should probably use this
just because boxycharm send it to me for
a review and I feel obligated to review
it for you so I'll probably use this but
I will probably sharpen it and pass it
on to somebody afterward just because I
don't need this it is in the shade evety
which i imagine is black and then last
in here we got a hashtag girl power at
liquid lipstick by the beauty crop and
the beauty crop has been hit-or-miss for
me they've sent a couple of things from
the Beauty crop in the past and this
just kind of been okay so I'm very
excited to use this I love the packaging
its frosted and it's cute and it's got
the little gold lips on it and let's see
if it has a scent to it very mild
chocolatey scent smells good smells nice
so I am anxious to try this it
definitely looks like a color that I
would wear and yeah I will keep you
posted on this for next month so I want
to thank you so much for watching my
boxycharm review and unboxing I hope you
