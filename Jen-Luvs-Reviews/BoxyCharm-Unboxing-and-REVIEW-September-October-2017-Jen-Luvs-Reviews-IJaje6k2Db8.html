boxycharm review and my October
boxycharm unboxing ish thing because I
have kind of already unboxed this but my
initial thoughts about what's in October
at boxycharm and what I'll be reviewing
next month I am really excited to talk
about these boxes because they are
really really interesting the products
that are in here and I can't wait to
share my thoughts with you right about
now boxycharm is sent to me for review
by boxycharm but this is not a sponsored
video they've been sending me this box
for a very very long time and I am very
thankful to get it every month but that
does not influence my review at all I
always keep you in mind and whether I
would pay twenty one dollars for this
box if I was paying for it cuz y'all
would know if I was pulling your chain
on something you'd call me on it I know
you would so let's go ahead and talk
about what we got in the September box
and whether I personally felt like it
was worth it or not
so um well let me just tell you there's
a huge value in this box but I honestly
I'm gonna tell you right now I'm not a
fan of the actual products that were in
here as far as the way that they perform
so let's talk about the pure soirée
Diaries palette I was so excited to get
this palette because I opened it up and
I looked at it and I don't know I just
feel like I can tell just by looking at
shadows sometimes that this is gonna be
an interesting palette this is gonna be
fun to play with and for me this palette
was just okay and that totally bummed me
out because I feel like you know I've
heard such good things about pure
eyeshadows and I've never tried that I
was really looking forward to trying
them and I just I felt like my looks
just kind of fell flat when I use this I
felt like the mattes especially were
weak I felt like the foils were much
better this row down here well it's at
the bottom here I felt like that row was
definitely the strength of this palette
but I feel like the mattes for me kind
of blend it away the lasting power
wasn't great I had trouble getting them
to blend into each other without
disappearing and I don't know I just had
a tough time with this and I tried it
with a lot of different brushes and I
tried it with you know the shape tape
underneath it trying to get it to stick
I didn't try glitter glue with this
that's one thing I didn't try
but I just I just felt like every look I
created with this just kind of was like
blah unless I used a lot of these foil
shades which I did really enjoy so I
know for a fact that I'm going to end up
decluttering this because this is a
palette that I just didn't have fun
using which makes me really sad because
tears seems like a great brand but this
just wasn't a great product for me next
up was the Brio Gio
don't despair repair deep conditioning
mask I have to tell you I did not use
this again because I haven't used this
multiple times and I don't feel like
this is intense enough for my hair my
hair I feel like really needs intense
moisture like what are the ones I've
using the macadamia oil one is really
really good and I'm gonna figure what
the other one's called I can't remember
off the top of my head the other ones
that I really like I'll put a picture
here if I can't if I can find it and
those are really intense very hydrating
really make my hair feel very very
smooth this one is just seems to be like
a regular conditioner for me it works
fine like a regular conditioner but it's
just not intense enough for a deep
repair mask for me so this one's a no
for me I'm actually gonna pass this on
another thing I wanted to show you was
this brush this is the perfecting face
brush by bare minerals I did own this at
one point I did declutter it so I don't
want to open this one either I do want
to pass this on I just don't want to
waste it because I know I'm not going to
use it one thing I remembered as I'm
looking at this and trying to Rack my
brain and remember what I thought of
this because I really didn't want to use
it so I wanted to pass it on nice and
clean was that it's very small for a
foundation brush and I like my
foundation brush just to be bigger so
they cover more territory as I'm using
it so that I could do my foundation
faster this was sold with the bare
minerals serum foundation that was also
just okay for me
so i don't know i mean i think i
remember saying in the unboxing of this
that i thought people would like it but
then i read some reviews and a lot of
people don't seem to like this brush so
this one's gonna be another no just
because I remember decluttering it and I
also read some reviews where other
people didn't like it so this is gonna
be a wah-wah as well and I know this
sounds very negative and I feel like
every boxycharm video there's always
some of the comments like what did I
have to do to please you they have to
put good products in to please me that's
what they have to do so there let's go
on to the next one that was just okay
for me this is a it's good but it's not
my favorite
these are the colour-pop ultra satin
the ultra matte lips flake on me they're
dry and they flake these aren't as dry
and they don't flake so these are better
for me than the ultra matte lips my
color pop but at the same time they do
give you the look but whole lip carnal
look where your lips are like I'm making
this face and it reminds me of raw
Beauty Christie's level but um so I
didn't hate having gotten this product I
do like the shade I am wearing it today
but I do have a lorac gloss over top of
because I wanted to deepen it just a tad
bit for this look that I'm wearing so
you know I'm not hating than I have it I
will probably use it occasionally but
it's definitely not my favorite liquid
lipstick of all time now we're gonna
move on to things I actually liked yes
there are some things in here that I
like this is the Mac eyebrow pencil I do
really like this Mac eyebrow pencil I am
wearing it today it's very easy to go on
it's a great color for me and it goes on
very creamy but not so creamy that it
jumps up my brows and I like it a lot
it's very very nice I don't know if I
would pay full price for this but I do
really like it and I'm very thankful to
have it in the box and then the last
product that I really liked was the
studio makeup blush this is the luminous
loose blush and it says a silky
lightweight blush that gives a pop of
healthy radiance on the cheeks but I am
wearing it today it's a very light blush
I don't really see the radiance in it
it's not completely matte but it's
definitely not radiant in any way I
wouldn't call this like a highlighter
slash blush it's definitely a blush I
really like the tone of it I find the
lasting power to be really good it'll
last me a good solid six to eight hours
of wear time and then by like the eight
to nine hour mark it starts to really
fade quite a bit but that's typical for
a blush for me so not outstanding wear
time but definitely respectable wear
time beautiful color and I don't mind
the loose powders I know a lot of people
find them to be messy I don't really
find this one to be super messy I really
like the cap that's inside that of
course looks super messy right now what
I do is I tap it off into this and then
I swirl my brush and it the brush that
I've been using is like an angled semi
fluffy brush with this and it picks up
the powder really really nicely it
deposits it beautifully it's it's not
one that will bring me to clown face
really easily where I have to correct
mistakes it's just a beautiful blush
this is definitely my favorite thing the
box and I'm so
thankful to have it so overall was this
worth $21 to me these two of the two
products I enjoyed it's on the edge it's
on the edge of no it's close its kind
monetarily these are worth more than $21
just these two products but I mean I
really really like the blush so maybe
maybe it's worth $21 but it's definitely
dancing on that edge since everything
else in the box of things that I
probably wouldn't have purchased I guess
with this thrown in I would say this is
worth $21 to me definitely but I'm sad
that I didn't like the other products
more and that's a no fault to Boxey sure
I'm just like last month when I said
pretty much the same thing I mean
they're putting in a ridiculous amount
of awesome stuff that's high monetary
value and if you don't have a big
collection then you might actually
really like that palette more than I did
just i I've tried a lot of eyeshadows
and it just doesn't live up to what I
enjoy using so makes me sad but but yeah
I would say this is worth $21 but not a
super amount over $21 alright are you
ready to see what I got in my toe box
I'm excited to show you one product in
here is a major repeat for me this is
the dr. Brandt pore dermabrasion pore
perfecting exfoliator I've gotten this
in multiple subscription boxes over the
years I still have a full size from I
think fabfitfun so this is another one
that I'm going to end up passing along
it does have a very coarse grit to it so
definitely be prepared if you're gonna
use this that it's not a super gentle
exfoliator you have to really be gentle
when you rub it and don't go all ham on
your face and scratch your face all up
it's not a good idea just be be nice and
gentle when you use this because it is a
sandy texture I do like this product
it's a really nice product but I already
own it so this is gonna end up being
passed along we also got another lip
product this is the TARDIS lip paint in
Oh X 0 X or X 0 X 0 I'm not sure because
upside down it looks exactly the same
and it is a red shade which i think is
really nice to give out red shades like
this not only do they look beautiful on
a lot of skin tones but it's also you
know the holidays coming up and
everything a nice bright red lip is
really nice for fall and for winter so I
also like that it's not an orange base
red I do like the TARDIS lip paint
formula I
haven't tried it in a little while
though it's been at least three or four
months before I put since I've put a
TARDIS lit paint on my lips so I want to
do it again and now that I'm thinking
about I think they changed the formula
and I didn't like the new formula as
much as the old formula okay I'm gonna
have to retry this and I'll let you know
next month to go along with that which I
love they gave us a matching lip liner
but this one is by a brand called junta
bloom and it is lip flare liner pencil
in rich red and it is a sharpening
pencil kind of lip liner I have never
heard of this brand before so I
personally don't mind getting brands
that I've never heard of in subscription
boxes I think it's nice to try out new
brands and see what they're all about so
definitely excited to try that we got an
eyeshadow crayon by dirty little secrets
I've seen them at a lot of epsy events
I'm not a big fan of their lip products
I find them to be very drying so I was
excited that it wasn't a lip product
that it was an eye product and this is
an eyeshadow crayon these are really
nice for those days where you don't feel
like putting on eye makeup and you just
want to go right right all over your lid
and kind of Pat it around and be done
that works really really well for my
skintone with a shade like this if you
are of a deeper skin tone this may be
really nice to just kind of go over a
train train train and the inner corners
pat pat pat and give you a nice little
quick brightening to an existing I look
but overall I really like crayons like
this I haven't tried this one yet but I
will let you know and finally the thing
I am always excited about in this box
and I was so nervous I was gonna get the
pressed version because I have the
pressed version but I got the liquid I'm
so excited this is the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter liquid in Prosecco pop I
do have this in the Jacqueline Hill face
palette I have the pressed version but
this is the liquid version and it looks
gorgeous I love the press version so to
get this in a boxy charm
is kind of ridiculous because these are
legit expensive I have a feeling this is
gonna make the whole box for me like if
it included nothing else I mean it's
yeah a tart lip paint and this in the
same box
I think that's outrageous I don't know
how abox each arm does it I swear they
must have like magical spells they cast
on these companies to get them to
include like this much awesome stuff in
their box I mean like I just don't get
it I don't I don't get how they do it
it's like unbelievable so sue
we're super excited by the October box I
cannot wait to bring it back to you in
November for my October review and
November unboxing if you get bossy time

box and what you thought of things so
