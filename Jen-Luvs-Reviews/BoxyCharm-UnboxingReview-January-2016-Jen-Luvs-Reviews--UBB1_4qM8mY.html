hello my friends welcome back to boxing
charm I am so excited to be getting boxy
charm once again there was a little
confusion between me and boxy charm and
I didn't get box each on for four months
but we're back girlfriends and
boyfriends we are back so I'm very
excited to be once again reviewing a
boxy charm for you so we're going to go
ahead and jump right into the unboxing
this isn't really it's kind of like
halfway between the unboxing and a
review because I've tried about half of
these products we're going to come back
in February to do a full review of the
January box and then we'll do kind of an
unboxing of the februari box that's the
way I've been doing my subscription
boxes lately and it's working out really
really really well so we're I'm just
gonna tell you about everything I can't
tell you about with this let's go ahead
and get started so the theme for this a
month is boxy charm eyes on 2016 this is
very creepy for me um anything with like
random eyeballs is just creepy to me it
reminds me of that on that movie was it
called mad love what was it with um we
drew barrymore where she went crazy and
she chopped up all the eyeballs out of
the magazine and stuck them all over a
walls that's what this reminds me of
it's just creepy to me but there's some
good stuff in this box and I'm going to
go ahead and show you what we got in
this box I am so excited about these
these are revolution boxy charm I set is
what this is called and it's by royal
and langnickel it is 100-percent vegan
professional makeup brushes I am
absolutely loving this brush set so far
really and truly Oh little I forgot to
tell you a little thingy in the
beginning boxy charm is 21 dollars a
month I do get this as a box to review
meaning that i do not pay for it but i
am not paid to do this unboxing just so
you know um so then they love when I'm
honest I've been with boxy charm since
they're very their second Fox ever so
this one right here is really good for
packing on color this one here is great
for getting color into the crease and
then this one's great for blending so
it's a nice set to have to do a complete
I look um this one is probably my least
favorite it's kind of the most difficult
to work with but I'm learning to love it
it's just kinda
taking some warming up where these two i
automatically love from the jump but
overall really happy with this brush set
i'm going to keep playing with it over
the next month and i'll keep you posted
on how it goes i'm also going to wash
them between now and then so we can see
whether there's any shedding things like
them next up is a product that i have
tried quite a few times as well this is
the star looks pro luxe long-wear
eyeliner pen i will show you the tip on
this it looks like of this and when you
put it on it looks oh look at this it is
a very very very black draws a nice fine
line pretty easy to use it does seep up
into my fine lines a bit but most
eyeliners do so what I do is I take a an
angled liner brush and I just kind of
smudge out where it seems to be kind of
feathering up into my fine lines and
then it works out just perfectly with
that my only complaint about this is
with the wing the wing never completely
set so if you accidentally go like this
like the first day that i warn't I
looked in the mirror and I had black
smudge all over right here on one of my
eyes I forget which one but it was like
no good no good very bad day that I
would much rather an eyeliner flake off
then be smudgy like that and look
terrible so that's my only thing is just
be careful doing a wing with this and
just don't rub your eyes alright the
next thing that I'm like seriously I'm
so excited about this product like I
seriously don't ever want to wear
another mascara ganna I know that that
sounds very dramatic but I'm not being
dramatic this is the blank mascara
amplify it says stop painting your
lashes tube them this is my first tubing
mascara that I have ever used and I am
wearing it today I can't stop wearing it
it is a very ginormous brush you can see
let me tip of my glasses for a second
but you can see how big it is next to my
eye it's huge um I'll tell you the
reason why I love this when I take off
my makeup at night my biggest thing that
I fight with is getting my mascara off
where I thought I have to rub my eyes I
mean no matter what matter what i'm
using i do have to have some kind of
rubbing of my eyes in order to get my
mascara off not with this with this all
you do is you take as warm of water as
you can stand and it's just basically
the the tubes of mascara just kind of
flake off your eyes but not with cool
water not with makeup remover not with
any
thing except for warm water and it just
like comes off so easily and it's like
ah you know instead of like uh huh it
just makes me happy gives me peace at
the end of the day and after a long day
at work and dealing with my two small
children that's what I want is peace and
this mascara gives me peace and it makes
me happy so really been loving this I'm
going to continue to work with it I'll
let you know if there's any problems
with it in the next review and then the
last thing that came in this box each
arm was the revealed smoky palette this
is going to go to someone because I do
already own this a coastal scents had
sent this to me as a pre-launch item and
there have been hit and misses for me
for coastal scents for the reveal
pallets this quality wise i think is the
best quality reveal pellet that exists I
do have a full review on this whisk
watches and it the shades are pretty
much exact dupes for the urban decay
naked naked smoky palette so if you want
to see more about this you can click the
link down below and though you know you
can see all the swatches and everything
and decide for yourself what you think
about this but I've used this many times
since i got it i guess about a month ago
and i am just i'm still loving it i'm
still loving it it's a fantastic quality
palette just amazing absolutely amazing
so this boxy charm was a huge win for me
I mean I've got three out of the four
products are phenomenal and this one's
just good so I'll take it man I'll take
it it makes me this this is an excellent
boxy trauma it's a what a way to bring
back boxy charm to Jen loves reviews
channel I mean like it's a stellar
stellar box I am really looking forward
to seeing what happens in February and
whether they can keep this on a roll and
I'm just I'm really excited about this
if you got boxy charm I would love to
know what you think of the products that
you got this month and whether you have
the same opinions as I do or maybe a
little bit different I'm all about the
honesty so whatever you think I would
love to know in the comments below thank
you so much for watching men
I love and i'll see you in the next
