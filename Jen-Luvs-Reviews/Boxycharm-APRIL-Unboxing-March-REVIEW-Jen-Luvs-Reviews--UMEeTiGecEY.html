review of the March boxy charm and the
unboxing of the April boxy charm if
you've never been to one of my box of
Tron videos before this is how it works
I get my boxycharm I try it for a month
and then I give you a review of all the
products inside but even if you don't
get boxycharm you'll have an idea of
whether these products are for you or
not and then I show you the current
month and show you what I'll be
reviewing next month so it's a little
bit different I am sent boxycharm before
review but I am not paid to do this
video it is not a sponsored video I just
don't pay for the boxes so let's go
ahead and jump into the marsh box and
what I got I am wearing some of it on my
face I'm wearing the eye shadow palette
and the lip products right now so first
of all let's talk about the eye shadow
palette this is my favourite thing in
the box this eye shadow palette is so
good I was really nervous about this
because I heard some things from the
community and on my Facebook group which
I will link down below I've heard some
things that people weren't really happy
with this and I don't know it's working
great for me so I don't know what was
going on why it wasn't working for some
people naked cosmetics I really enjoy
their brand I wish that they weren't so
expensive though I feel like they the
prices are really high for their
products but they're really really good
so if you have the money to spend I
definitely recommend this brand as
you'll be able to see in the application
right now they tap onto the lid very
very nicely they're very opaque and then
they blend really nicely together I
think that's because there aren't a lot
of fillers and maked cosmetics they use
as few ingredients as possible it's
mostly pigment so when you blend them
together it's almost like having them in
a pan and mixing the colors together so
it really works out very well and I like
the way they set up this palette and
that they have a lighter shade in the
green a mid-tone shade in the orange and
then a deeper shade in the red so you
can actually get a look out of these
three shades or of course you can pull
these shadows into other palettes and
create however many looks that you can
possibly think of
so I mean overall really really happy
with this I have no complaints lasting
power is really really good I have worn
these only with primer I haven't tried
them without a primer but with primer
they work fantastic and I'm super happy
with these moving on to the lip products
that I'm wearing today first the I'm a
precious a lip liner this is by real her
and I do really like this lip liner it's
very creamy to go on I have used it with
a lip gloss overtop and I think it's
absolutely beautiful this is my second
favorite product in the box then we have
a liquid lipstick by real hard this is
in the shade ladylove and on the side it
says I deserve the best this is a very
very me shade I love the shade I love
the initial application my biggest
complaint about this is it's extremely
sticky it feels terrible on the lips to
be quite honest with you it feels really
bad this liquid lipstick has been on for
about I don't know 20 minutes or so and
watch
it's not good it's not good at all and
it also will flake off the lip so if you
can manage to tolerate the stickiness
then you get the flakiness it's really
not a liquid lipstick that I enjoy and I
honestly like the color is the best
thing about this but other than the
color I really don't like this liquid
lipstick formula at all moving on to the
deluxe fan brush by Crown brush this
brush is just too big for my face I just
can't I can't find a good use for this I
think that if you use bronzer like all
over your face if you do like the
bronzer on the forehead and the chin and
all that you'll probably really like
this I don't like the way that looks on
me I feel like it just looks strange
maybe it's just because I haven't
figured out how you percent how to do it
but every time I try to do bronzer on
the forehead and the underneath here it
just looks dumb I look ridiculous
so so I couldn't find a good use for
this on the cheeks just because it fits
over my entire cheek I guess you could
probably use this for face powder but I
don't prefer this style of brush for
face powder prefer more round style so I
will probably pass this on to someone
just because I mean it's very soft it's
very nice it's just not a functional
brush for me and then the last product
in here is the Smashbox photo finish
primer I've tried this a million times
they are constantly sending out samples
of this I've gotten the multiple
subscription boxes I've tried it many
many times I've never bought a full-size
of it so this is going to actually get
passed on but what I can tell you about
it is it I've heard from a lot of people
that this does clog pores for people
with oily skin it is dimethicone base i
believed either silicon or dimethicone
some kind of silicone base and but it is
very smooth to go on it feels very very
good on the skin and I personally really
really liked it a lot it's like it helps
extend aware of my makeup on my normal
skin I just heard that as a complaint
from people with acne prone skin but
other than that I really like this
primer and I have no complaints about it
it's a great primer so was this worth
the $21 price tag definitely but barely
and the only reason why is because these
are the only two products that I would
use if this wasn't so amazing I would
say this box was not worth $21 you know
if I saw this for $15 I would buy it
without hesitation I know that it says
that this thing is worth $39.99 I would
never pay $39.99 for this I don't feel
like it's worth it but I feel like if
you really like these shades $20 I think
would be a fair price for this
definitely not 39.99 no no I do really
like the lip pencil as well it's very
creamy I have no complaints about the
lip pencil I didn't really need the
Smashbox primer and I won't use this so
just barely worth $21 for me this month
not my favorite box but it was still
pretty good no give you my opinion of
the April box you have lots in here
these are the pure sponges you get three
of them I have tribe you before and I
find them to be very hard so I will tell
you I am NOT super excited to see these
in the box I have the pink one so I'll
be giving you my full review using the
one that I already have and these will
probably end up being given away this
right here I'm excited for this is the
project beauty hair Girt strawberry
banana smoothing yogurt
shampoo and I have tried their
conditioner before the conditioner
wasn't enough I might have even been
like considered a mask I think it was
considered a mask and I just didn't have
enough for me so I gave it to my
daughter and she loves it so I'm excited
to try the shampoo I will probably keep
this for myself as long as it does a
good job washing my hair I'll probably
won't pass this on I'll probably end up
keeping this one really excited to see
the Oh for highlighter in hero for
highlighters are amazing lasting power
over highlighters are really really good
and the colors are beautiful this is in
the shade Rodeo Drive and I'm was really
excited to this I feel like this pretty
much makes the entire box for me so I'm
I'm really excited about that
also in here we have allegory story
cosmetics and it's a lip gloss and I
will show you the color it is like a
nude brown shade this is called Plato's
cave and I have not tried this yet the
packaging is adorable with a little
holographic clouds and they are
holographic and that they reflect
rainbows even though they are not a
hologram I don't know I get scared to
use that word these days so anyway so
this is the way that it swatches
and scent is a little bit cakey cake
smelling a little lipstick e smelling
but it's very mild I really like that
scent and I'm excited to try that and
then the last thing in here is the
concealer collection I honestly don't
like to get concealer palettes because I
feel like concealer palettes are great
for people that are makeup artists I
don't feel like they're great for the
average person because I mean how many
of these shades am I really going to use
I mean I guess I think what I'm going to
try to do with this is try to use these
as eyeshadow bases so like let's say I'm
going to be doing a warm shadow look I
may be able to use one of these maybe
mocha or something as a base and then
see if it makes my eyeshadows crease
that's what I'm crossing my fingers I
can use these as eyeshadow bases I don't
see any of these except for maybe this
one here as being able to be used as a
contour and there's just so much that I
don't know what I'm going to do within
this so this is something I just don't
prefer to get in subscription boxes I
don't prefer it I don't buy these but
you know it does look like a very
promising box in this and also this we
will see but I will be back next month
