pretty does it blend yes it blends oh it
blends away my friends welcome to my
review of the July boxycharm and my real
pretty much true unboxing of the August
boxycharm can I speak today so this is
how it works I tried all of the products
in the previous month and I also show
you what I got in the current month that
way you don't just get to see the same
thing that everybody else shows you but
you also get reviews of products which
is pretty stinking awesome if I might
say so myself so let's start talking
about this July box in the July box oh I
didn't tell you I do get this for review
but that never influences my opinion I
always am going to be honest with you
whether I get something for a review or
not alright so let's talk about what we
got in the box the first thing I want to
show you is the PYT argan oil from
morocco oil treatment I really like this
stuff I like argan oil on my hair in
general it just I feel like it hydrates
my hair I feel like it helps keep my
flyaways to a minimum still get flyaways
but keeps it to a minimum I like PYT as
a brand I have their hair straightener
that I love I got it I matched two years
ago still use it still love it still
just as good as the day that I bought it
the number one ingredient in this is not
argan oil though it's dimethicone which
is a silicone so just be aware of that
that you are getting a lot of silicone
which is what gives you that shine and
then the argan oil for the hydrating so
just so you know it isn't 100% pure
argan oil but it is a really nice
product I like the way they mix their
ingredients together was very very nice
well done uit well done the next thing
is this malee waterproof eyeliner
starlight waterproof eyeliner yes in the
shade ice blue I had at one point two of
these because at one point Maley was
putting these in new Beauty test tubes
and we got them in like two new Beauty
test tubes in a row so I already have
one of these I'd given one away I have
one of these I'm going to put this away
for future giveaway it's actually going
to go in the box right now this is where
I put my giveaway stuff for future I'm
going to swatch for you instead of that
one I'm going to swatch mine that
I have it's a beautiful island or it's
gorgeous the last thing I want is really
good on the lash line I doesn't last
forever on the waterline the lash line
does really well and it's a really nice
way to do that pop of color on the lower
lash line so definitely recommend it so
it's a really nice eyeliner but I do
already have one so yes so what's not
super excited to see it but that's just
a me personal thing because most people
probably don't have it next is the Neue
I believe I'm saying that right in the
shade a Malbec this is their lip gloss
it's got a lot of color for a lip gloss
it's a very bright color I did not wear
this all day because I never found a
look that I was wearing where this
actually looked nice with it on my skin
tone with the colors I was choosing so I
never wore it all day as far as scent
goes it doesn't have a super strong
scent it's very very mild but it's got
the tiniest bit of a not fantastic scent
a little chemically but it's very very
melt so if you're sensitive to scents
you may not smell it and it's a
beautiful very very bright pink it's
just a shade that I don't typically wear
sounds a little sad about that
and don't forget expect it to go to full
opacity because it isn't a liquid
lipstick it is a lip gloss and it is
gonna give you that shiny Ness to it as
far as stickiness it does not have
stickiness but I wouldn't say it's
hydrating either it's just you know it's
a gloss that's not sticky it's not super
heavy it's a nice formula I just wish I
got in a different shade that was more
me but you know can't win them all right
and then finally the one that a lot of
people are very excited about including
myself we got this Oprah Pro makeup
palette this is one of those it's like a
Z palettes a magnetic palette and you
can put your magnetic shadows in here I
was very much in need of one of these
I'm very thankful that boxycharm sent
this because they had sent an Oprah
powder that had no outer packaging to it
a few months ago and it'll be really
nice to throw that in here it's I think
is their banana powder or something
similar to a banana powder it might have
been a banana powder but I'm gonna pop
that in here and then they sent also
along with that six eyeshadow shades I
believe these are pretty pricy
individually I think that they're ten
dollars apiece individually now I do
really like the shadows I think the
shadows are great I'm wearing them on
today along with some shimmer over top
of them they're very easy to use I'm
wearing in my crease this one here on my
lid I'm wearing this one mostly and then
this one in the inner corner I found
these two kind of muddied together so I
had to brighten the outer corner the
inner corner not the outer corner i did
brighten the inner corner with this
shade and then i put some of the black
in the outer corner and then i'm wearing
that is brand new to me let me go good
it this is not part of the boxycharm
review but I'm wearing I popped over top
of it the Pat McGrath Feingold this is
the pigment that comes in her fetish kit
this was sent to me by a subscriber so I
want to thank you so much Nancy for
sending this to me I appreciate it a lot
I'm gonna be reviewing this and then
when the lip kits come out I want to
review this kit and then the lip kit to
see whether it's worth it the price but
I did pop this all over my lids the
first time I've used it today and I like
the way that the look came out I do like
the way that these work I feel like they
blend very well lasting power is good
but are they worth Technologist shadow
to me no they're not worth $10 a shadow
they're definitely worth $6 a shadow
make makeup geek is six dollars a shadow
the L'Oreal infallible czar six dollars
a shadow I think they're worth six
dollars a shadow I don't think they're
worth more than that but I do think
they're good don't get me wrong they're
good but they're not so outstanding that
they need to be more expensive than
makeup geek and and the L'Oreal
infallible which are some of my favorite
single eyeshadows so that's kind of how
I feel about that so do I feel like this
was worth twenty one dollars
absolutely this month I feel it was
worth twenty one dollars really really
loved this I love that they sent the Z
palette and the shadows I think that's
fantastic really like the PYT hair oil
did not really have a use for the Mallee
and that but it is a nice liner for most
people so I would say that that would be
included into the awesomeness of this
box was not a fan of the neue gloss but
if you're the right you know this is a
shade that you like then yeah this would
definitely be a win as well it's not a
bad product just didn't match my
personal taste so but even for me
personally even if it was just these two
products I think that this would
definitely be worth twenty one dollars
to me so let's go ahead and jump into
showing you what I got in August and
I'll tell you whether I'm excited about
it or not
again I this is I just kind of peaked in
the box I haven't opened anything yet so
they changed the packaging a bit as you
can see they they changed the cover of
the box and they also change inside it
says hashtag boxycharm on the inside and
it says hello charmer out of the box and
I really love the change I think it's
super cute and unique I really like it
so well done guys and then in the box
we got the beauty for real and this is a
shadow stick again haven't even opened
this or swatched it or anything so we've
got this little crayon e thing ooh
that's pretty very shimmery and pretty
does it blend yes it blends oh it blends
away kind of blends away ooh definitely
put a based on over this does a build
there's a blend a buildin blends a
little bit I don't know I'm gonna have
to try it on the eye and see what
happens and then we got dirty little
secret I don't even know what this is
what is dirty little secret oh yeah
it reminds me the Minnie Mouse
collection matte lipstick mmm
not much rude no mushy holy moly that's
opaque doesn't smell do you bet I've got
a little tiny bit of a chemically set
but not bad but oh I'm gonna try it
can't say I'm gonna wear it I'm gonna
try it as an orange base red okay let's
keep going on that one weeks okay but
it's a nice product for the right person
and this is ample ash mascara serum
truly bold full long-lasting Noom ample
ash amplifying volume amplifying mascara
serum so does it have color to it lets
us find out now okay yes it has color to
it so it's I guess it is supposed to
make your lashes longer over time I
imagine I don't know we will have to try
it and find out I don't know if a month
it's gonna be long enough for me to be
able to tell usually these last serums
take a good few months to show any
difference and then this is the aloe
cure skin care time serum
time Repair Serum ooh I will have to try
this as well this is huge
whoo looks very milky smooth away the
appearance of lines and wrinkles with
age-defying green tea extract alpha and
beta hydroxy acids okay sounds good to
me
nice see if it has a funky smell or
anything cram it up a little bit come on
pump you can do it you can do it you can
do it I believe in you I believe in you
what's coming there it is okay see how
it feels feels cold and wet has a tiny
bit of a skin care kind of smell which
is typical for skin care like a little
light florally kind of scent that some
skin care has the moisturizer kind of
sense very nice so we'll have to try
that out and then the last thing in here
is a brush and bronzer a mini palette
and brush combo by Coastal Scents and I
do enjoy Coastal Scents products on the
whole I definitely have seen some goods
I really like their hot pots a lot of
their individual shadows okay let's see
what we got here typical looking Coastal
Scents bright cute packaging blush and
bronzer mini palette ooh I love those
shade those shades are pretty ooh okay
so we have a shimmery blush we have a
matte blush we have a shimmery
highlighter we have a matte bronzer and
a shimmery bronzer oh very nice let's
see how they swatch they feel a little
powdery but they don't move that
highlight low whoo that looks good
whoo that's how we're looking that's how
we're looking so off to play with those
in see very nice whoo I'm anxious to
play with that very cool awesome okay
and then it comes with this little brush
which i think is a super nice touch so
this looks like a really good boxycharm
