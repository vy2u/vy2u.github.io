the January boxy charm and my unboxing
ish thing of the february boxycharm so
you'll know what is going to be reviewed
next month yes I love doing my boxy
charms this way because not only do you
get to see what comes in a boxy charm
but you'll also get full reviews of the
products from the previous month
that's my faves so hopefully you'll love
it too if you do definitely make sure
you hit the subscribe button if you do
not know boxycharm is $21 a month
I do get boxycharm sent to me for review
but this is not a sponsored video and no
matter what it doesn't influence my
review at all anyway you're gonna hear
exactly what I think of these products
let's go ahead and jump into the January
box so in the January box our theme was
and the charm award goes to there are
five items in this box
all of them are full-size the first one
is the pure Chateau cheek stain blush
tint and brush duo now my idiot stuff
did not realize there was a brush in the
back because apparently I don't know how
to read so I didn't use the brush at all
even in mid tip oh I did not use a brush
but I will tell you I did really really
like using this with the elf stippling
brush I also found that it works well
blending out with my fingers but
honestly I prefer it with the elf
stippling brush and I wish that I could
tell you how it worked with this brush
but I apparently am a fail when it comes
to double-sided items I just didn't I
didn't realize it was there but I will
tell you that the lasting power on this
is phenomenal it is so good it lasted me
all day long and I did make the mistake
of putting this over top of powder a
couple of times using this and it didn't
seem to affect it at all that I used it
on top of powder which makes me really
really happy because sometimes I just
forget and I put my powder on and then I
put on cream products and sometimes it
just doesn't play well this one did
great the other thing is if it smells
like cranberries which makes me really
really happy I can't smell it unless I
really really try but what I do it
smells so good so definite thumbs up on
the pure cheek stain and a Cabernet
next thing in here is the Oscar blondie
dry shampoo spray I really really like
this stuff let me show you how the spray
goes just so you know what we're dealing
with here it is a very strong spray it
smells like lemons it works very well it
doesn't leave let me put it on my hand
so you can see see how there's no
powdery white cast it's just a clear
liquid inside in case you're worried
about some of the dry shampoos that will
leave a white in your hair looking
almost like powder this does not do that
really really like this I don't like it
quite as much as my batiste dry shampoo
but this is definitely a close second I
really like it a lot next is a product
that I was quite concerned about whether
I would like it or not and it is the
crown brush fan brush they call it the
deluxe highlighter fan it's a very very
thin and I tend to like this size of
brush but I like them to be a little bit
thicker because I want it to be able to
pick up product but I ended up actually
really liking it I used it in
conjunction today with the vintage by
Jessica Liv ask I Nilima schemed leave
us kind I'm gonna say leave us kind it
has a rose quartz shade and a chocolate
diamond shade and I use the rose quartz
shade today and I use this brush and it
really puts on just the slightest amount
of product for those really highly
pigmented very from space kinds of
highlighters and I love that I can do
that with this so definite thumbs up on
the brush I was very very surprised but
for those less pigmented hilar does the
ones that aren't from space like the
hourglass one the one from essence
things like that the ones they're just a
little more of a subtle glow I would
probably use a thicker one but this was
really nice to like Becca highlighters
and things like that
now with the highlighter palette I do
love the initial application but I'll
have to tell you it does not last long
on my skin at all it'll only last me
about four hours before it's completely
gone which I don't like so this would
definitely be something that you would
have to reapply at least in my opinion
but I do like the initial look of it a
lot and I really like both shades I like
that there's a mirror in here this
packaging I don't like because it does
collect dirt and yuckiness and and
product and it's really really gross the
way this is starting to look with the
white and just the way that it is it's
um
like um I don't even know what kind of
plastic this is but it doesn't have an
rzu soft feel to it but it definitely
has a unique kind of plastic feel but it
is easy to wipe off if you do want to
clean it you should need to take a wet
cloth or something to wipe it off it
cleans up very easily I just you know I
don't want my product to look like that
ever you know and then the last thing in
here was the desk New York organic
infused nail treatment and I wouldn't
have known what this was except for that
I looked up on the website it does say
on the bottom ultra suede matte topcoat
I do wish that it said on the buckle but
I'm being nitpicky now this was a very
hit-or-miss product with me depending on
what nail polish I use and how much I
shook it before I used it sometimes it
would give a white film overtop of my
nails that was I don't know what was
happening with it where in the picture
that you're looking at right now I put
it on those I put it actually on three
nails it's on my pinky finger my ring
finger and my middle finger but for some
reason over this polish I guess maybe
just you know what had collected on the
brush maybe from not shaking it enough
it only jumped up two out of the three
fingers so I don't know what is
happening with this product but there's
definitely something going on in here
that makes it very inconsistent and I
think that it's the amount that you
shake it to make sure you shake this
really really good when you use it if
you can get it to work it works great
but your are taking that risk of getting
that white film over top of your polish
which is of course definitely a do-over
on the nails if that happens to you so
use it your own risk I wish that it
performed better consistently but you
know it is what it is just definitely
not something I would recommend
purchasing just because it's a lot of
hassle so is this worth twenty one
dollars
absolutely I do feel like on the card
that the prices are inflated as far as
what their value is it says that this
brush is worth $12.99 I wouldn't pay
more than six dollars for this brush I
do think it's worth six dollars though
for the dry shampoo you can find these a
lot of times at t.j.maxx and places like
that on sale I would pay up to nine
dollars for this this is a $23 dry
shampoo I would never pay that I'd
rather go get the batiste for a lot
cheaper the pure mineral stick is a $26
stick I would
pay that I would pay maybe twelve for it
max but I might just be being cheap here
you know pure is a little bit more of an
expensive brands lasting powers really
good but I'm just cheap I guess I don't
know it's just in my mind I'm thinking
twelve dollars max for this for the nail
treatment I would not buy this just
because it's such an inconsistent
formula as far as the application goes
and then the highlighter palette the
highlighter palette says it's worth
thirty five dollars I would never pay
thirty five dollars for this based on
the wear time I would pay fifteen
dollars for it maximum but definitely
not thirty five but overall I mean I
really think this is definitely worth
twenty one dollars
I mean in a box on a show of twenty one
dollars this is a definite yes well done
boxycharm a good job so now let's talk
about what I got in my February box I
have been trying these products already
at least some of them I've been trying
and I can tell you I'm very very excited
so the first one that I have not tried
yet and I can't believe I haven't tried
to get is the omnia eye kit by royal and
langnickel I was fortunate enough to
meet the folks over at Royal in that leg
nickel and they were telling me about
the omnia brushes and how they're
supposed to be similar to Japanese style
brushes and I haven't tried them yet and
I don't know what's wrong with me I
definitely need to dip into that and try
that I'm really excited about that we
also got a Z palette with two makeup
geek eyeshadows so the makeup geek
eyeshadows that I got I don't know if
other people got different ones but I
got creme brulee and I also got bitten
and these ones in here a foiled ones
that I purchased on my own recently and
I put them inside the Z palette so far
so good on these eyeshadows I'm just
going to give it a sneak peak I will
really really feel like them and the
foiled if you've not tried to makeup
geek foiled I can't even I can't even Z
palette I really like Z palettes there's
a lot of drama going on about Z palette
as a brand and a company boxycharm has
spoken out about they do not support the
the recent drama with Z palette if you'd
like to know more about it I'll link my
makeup minute down in the description
below it's a one-minute video and in
about the first 30 seconds I tell you
what happened with Z palette
if you're curious about that if you
don't know I will leave that down there
but you know I probably won't be
purchasing any Z palettes I don't see
any time in the future but I will
definitely be using this one I'll tell
you that because I like the way that it
works I have not used this yet this is
the reflecting floss in fig buy juice
beauty and it looks really really pretty
I'm very excited to try that and then
finally a full-size dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator
one thing I've noticed recently is my
skin seems to be starting to get on the
dry side I don't know if it's because
it's winter here or what but I
definitely need to start doing a little
bit more exfoliating of my skin so I'm
very excited to try this and the retail
price on this thing is insane this is a
$79 product which is crazy in a $21
boxycharm along with all the rest of
these other things I mean omnia brushes
are $30 for those two brushes because
they're like fancy-schmancy you know I
mean just a really insane monetary value
for these products but I will definitely
have to keep you posted on what I think
of the other products that I haven't
tried yet and will let you know next
month I want to thank you so much for
