review of boxycharm and unboxing of
boxycharm I'm running a little light
this month because a generation Beauty I
ended up a week behind so this video was
supposed to come out last week and it
just got too crazy and I just couldn't
do it I just couldn't do it
I still think you're going to love
hearing about the December boxycharm I'm
going to give you my full review on all
the products in here and I'm going to
show you what is gonna be reviewed this
month in February in case you don't know
boxycharm is $21 a month it is sent to
me for review but that does not affect
my review of it at all some week of some
months are great some months are less
great but I'm gonna tell you honestly
what I think of the products inside so
that maybe if you don't get boxycharm
you may want to invest in some of these
products on your own or maybe you're
considering signing up for boxycharm I
do have a link down below that does earn
me money if you sign up so you can feel
free to use that link down below or you
can feel free to go to boxycharm comm
it's the exact same thing for you just
one way helps me and the other way is
just you going on your own let me go
ahead and tell you what is in the
December of boxycharm and tell you what
I thought of everything so the first
thing in here was the buff collection by
pure cosmetics there is a coupon code on
the back it says save 25% off your first
order of $40 or more using code
boxycharm at checkout now when you open
this up immediately you notice something
that this may look very familiar to you
this is the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette
and you can kind of see the Front's are
very similar the packaging is very
similar but sir it's really similar as
well is the shadow range the range of
shades so on the top we have in the
Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and on the
bottom is the pur cosmetics palette so
when you look at this and you say oh I
got it in a box each are my boxes
traumas $21 a month I got this and a
bunch of other things that's a sweet
deal yes but if you look at the retail
price of this this is a $50 eyeshadow
palette the original Naked 3 is $52 so
if you were going to purchase this
outside of boxycharm
it better be just as good as the
original naked 3 and I can tell you it
is not as good as the original naked 3
the reason why I say that as I feel like
the pigmentation without any fix+
or water or anything is pretty stinking
bad it is the shadows will muddy
together there's no real pop I am
wearing it on my eyes today but I did
use fix plus I feel like fix plus or
water is really really important
especially fix plus is very I think is
even better than water as far as getting
these shadows to really pop on the lid
if you like a very natural look
well pink a pink natural look something
that's a little less poppy you will
probably enjoy this more than I did I
like a really bright bold lid so this
was not enough for me the other thing
was is that when I use the fix plus with
the naked 3 it doesn't clump up when I
use it with this palette it does clump
up so I have to spend time blending and
making sure there's no clumps and things
which is not as not very fun it's just
more work as what it comes down to you
can make it work but for $50.00
absolutely not worth $50 am I happy that
was set in boxycharm absolutely because
I feel like that makes this a good
palette for the price we paid for it
within the box see Charlie
next up in this box was the Ofra long
wear liquid lipstick I can tell you that
I did not open this and the reason why
is I already have a couple of dark
purple lipsticks and I don't wear them
very often this is kind of as dark as I
like to go and this is really dark so I
wanted to be able to pass this on to a
neighbor of mine that I think this is
gonna look really really gorgeous on but
I can't speak to is the Ofra formula I
really like the over formula it's a nice
mix between a more comfortable liquid
lipstick and one that will stay put
it's just it's kind of the best of both
worlds there I personally prefer the
bare minerals gen nudes because I find
them to be more comfortable but for
lasting power the Ofra definitely beats
the bare minerals in that there is just
not as comfortable so I do really enjoy
the Ofra formula but
fortunately I can't speak to this
particular one but I can tell you if its
lives up to the other over liquid
lipsticks it's probably pretty good if
you like the shape
next is the butter LONDON nail lacquer I
am wearing that on of my nails today I
did two coats today I did wear it one
other time and I feel like two coats
isn't quite enough like I really feel
like three coats you need four full
opacity lasting power on this was about
two days without a chip three days
before I just needed to take it off
because it was just a mess
which is pretty average for me it's not
great it's not bad it's just kind of
average and that's the way I feel about
butter not London nail polishes in
general is they're just kind of average
I feel like they're overpriced for what
they are this is a $15 nail Tosh I don't
feel like it's worth $15 but to get it
in a boxy charm I think is pretty
awesome
also I already have a lot of nail
polishes that are the shades so I kind
of get bummed out when I see another
deep red nail polish in a subscription
boxes like oh why can't they said to
differentiate cuz I just have so many of
these but I think to the average person
who doesn't have a huge nail polish
collection you'll probably enjoy using
this it's not fantastic like I said but
it's pretty good next up my favorite
thing in this box the makeup geek
eyeliner I am a huge Marlena fan
marlenas channel was the first channel
that I ever subscribed to that was a
beauty channel I don't even know beauty
channels existed and so if I watched
Marlena so I always have a special place
in my heart from makeup geek products I
never tried her eyeliners before so I
was really excited about this I've only
ever tried her eye shadows one thing I
really appreciate about makeup geek is
that I feel like Marlena puts a lot of
love into the products to make sure
they're really really good if I were
ever to start a makeup brand at any
point which is not going to happen any
time soon but if I ever were to I would
want to model my morality and my effort
to what Marlena has done in that she
just seems to put so much love and care
into everything and I feel like this
eyeliner is no different it did not last
a super long time on my waterline but it
did lash lasts really well on my lower
lash line so you could still see that
color on my eyes even at the end of the
day it didn't seep
down down on my lower lid at all which
is really a huge plus but it is creamy
and easy to go on I feel like it's a
very high quality eyeliner and I really
really like it
I probably won't purchase any more of
these just because I don't tend to use a
lot of pencil eyeliners so I probably
won't purchase another one but I'm very
thankful to have it and then the last
thing is a very anger moment of mine
right now I actually use the Beauty for
real lip scrub earlier today when I was
getting ready to film and I can't find
it I can't figure out what I did with it
I'm very scatterbrained if you don't
know that me I'm very scatterbrained i'm
very unfocused sometimes i do things
without realizing what i'm doing so I
think I just put it somewhere and wasn't
thinking about it and I don't know what
happened to it but anyway so I don't
have it to show you I'll put a picture
of it right there so you can see what it
looks like it has a very very nice sweet
taste to it it does seem to be a sugar
scrub like it's got sugar granules in it
it's very fine grains I felt like the
exfoliation was very nice hydration of
it was pretty good do I feel like it's
worth the 14 dollars probably not but I
think I would pay 10th for it I think
tens reason 114 is a little much but you
know it's not stupidly overpriced you
know just a little overpriced but I did
really like it I felt like it did a nice
job exfoliating my lips and it's a
pretty good product so overall for the
average person would I say this is worth
$21 absolutely I mean I feel like even
if you said this was worth $10 I think
that this is definitely worth $10 I mean
it's worth I would say up to $18 I would
go I don't think I'd go any further than
18 on this but I'd say $18 on this one
the ofra liquid lipstick definitely I
feel like $15 is a fair price it looks
like they raised the price on these to
almost $20 for a liquid lipstick I do
feel like any liquid lipstick at $20 is
a little bit pricey so I would say this
is definitely worth 15 though it's a
really really good formula the makeup
geek eyeliner full price is nine dollars
I definitely think it's worth nine
dollars definitely and the lip scrub I
said was worth about 10 and the nail
polish I would say
based on what it does as far as the
chipping and all that I would pay $10
for it I wouldn't pay the full price for
it so is this worth $21 oh yeah
absolutely now as far as me looking at
this if I saw this all on a shelf
would I buy it no I wouldn't because I
if I really really wanted to try this
maybe but this isn't no for me this is a
no for me the lip scrub I don't really
need this would be a big yes for me but
this isn't worth $21 and I feel like
this is the only product that made me
really excited and really happy but for
the average person I think it's
definitely worth $21 so now let's get
into the January box I did already film
this and then by the end of the video my
lipstick had moved so much that I look
like the Joker so I had to film it so I
apologize you don't get to see the true
unboxing but it looked really bad it I
can't even I can't even so let me show
you what I got and I will be reviewing
this at the end of this month so this is
the first thing this is a crown fan
brush it is a little bit bent from being
shipped I do think that it looks like
it's very thin there aren't really a lot
of bristles I wish it was about twice as
thick I do like the overall size of it
but it's not thick enough for me I don't
feel like it's gonna be great at laying
on highlighter product I feel like it
might be good for brushing away fall out
something like that but so far it
doesn't look like an impressive rush to
me this here is the Oscar blondie dry
shampoo spray this actually used to be
my holy grail dry shampoo spray before I
found thee but t'east
for brunettes which is now my holy grail
hot dry shampoo so I'm very thankful to
have this again and try it again if I
remember correctly it smells like lemons
and it works very well so I'm very
excited about this this is a cheek stain
by pure P you are not P you are e the
palette P you are and then we're really
excited about this it's let me swatch it
on my hand it is in the shade Cabernet
and it smells like cranberries and it's
very very bright but we'll see what
happens with it I'm a little scared of
it let me try to blend it in a little
bit
ooh that stains real quick alright if
you got this and you haven't tried it
yet you want to make sure you blend room
fires because that stains but it's
beautiful it's a beautiful shade on
skintone I'm really looking forward to
putting it on my cheeks next is the
vintage illuminating face highlighter
set by Jessica leavis kind we'll try it
latest kind that's what I'm gonna go for
we did get one of her highlighters
before it was just okay for me this one
feels a lot softer to me then that one
that one felt a little bit gritty where
this one feels really soft it feels
satiny to touch like you don't even feel
like you're getting product off it just
feels like a very soft cloth and then
when you swatch it they're very very
bright and bold there isn't a whole lot
of difference between the shades one is
just a little peachy or one's just a
little Pinker but I make looking forward
to trying this on my cheeks and seeing
the lasting power and things like that
and then finally this is the add s Adisa
desu I'm going to say a des New York
organic infused nail treatment
essentials and I am always up for doing
healthy things for my nails I do want to
do a little bit of ingredient looking up
on this this is the box that it came in
it says it's not tested on animals it's
made in the United States which makes me
really really happy it does have quite a
strong smell so I'm curious to see
whether I'm gonna be able to tolerate
the scent of it as I'm using it I'll
keep using it and I'll let you know at
the end of the month so I want to thank
you so much for watching this video if
you enjoyed it definitely make sure that
you subscribe so you don't miss the
January review and February unboxing at
the end of the month and mad love to you
I hope that you are well and I'll see
you in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
