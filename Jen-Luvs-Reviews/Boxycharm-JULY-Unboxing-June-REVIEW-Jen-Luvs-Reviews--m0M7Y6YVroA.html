longing Blastoise longing definitely not
the longest last thing that's what I'm
trying to say hello my friends welcome
to my boxycharm review / unboxing ich
thing that I do every month at least I
try to do it every month I thought I was
gonna miss this month because of my long
almost month-long vacation but I got a
chance to try quite a few of the
products from the June box so I did want
to share it with you instead of try to
cram it all in in August boxycharm is
set to me for review but that does not
influence my review at all it is $21 per
month and also show you what came in the
July box and what I will be reviewing in
the month of August after I have tried
all of the July products and received my
August box so let's go ahead and get
into what oh this is this month let's
hold off on that one for just a minute
and let's go into last month's box and
tell you what I thought of everything
now this month I was super excited to
see a product from Oprah Oprah is one of
my favorite brands their liquid
lipsticks are amazing I have quite a few
other products that Oprah had sent me a
while ago that I love from Oprah
unfortunately this was a product that
they did not enjoy from Oprah this is
their press powder oil control and I
think one of the reasons why I don't
love it is they don't have oil control
problems I don't think it's a product
for me I did find this left a white cast
on my skin it got very frustrating to
use I ended up giving up on it because
even when I tried to buff it out with a
clean fluffy brush I still felt like I
could see white on my skin so this is
definitely not a product for me even
though I do happen to love the brand I
did not love this product so I'm gonna
pass this on to an oily skin friend of
mine and hopefully she will love it more
than me and hopefully because of her
natural oils maybe it won't be so
powdery on her it was not good for me I
did not enjoy it
another product that is not particularly
for me but it was not a bad product with
the pharmacy hydrating coconut gel masks
I did suffer through trying one of these
nuts and you know me you know me well
you know that I do not enjoy sheet masks
in general they're very slimy I just
don't like the texture it's just not any
personally but I did you
one I didn't really see any effect on my
skin but the thing about my skin is I
have relatively normal skin so I'm
probably not going to see as much of an
effect as someone with very dry skin
which is I think who this is meant for
this is a hydrating gel mask so I
personally wasn't so excited about these
but I know I'm in the minority of people
that don't like sheet masks most people
love them it just wasn't for me and it's
again a personal preference thing it
wasn't anything against this particular
product product I really really liked
was the girl lactic Beauty precise eye
marker this is a really really nice
marker the point is super fine really
fine very easy to go on really really
black-winged lasted or really long time
with this definitely not the last
longing is for longing Blastoise longing
definitely not the longest last thing
that's what I'm trying to say wing I've
ever had it will rub off through the J
after a long time but there will still
be remnants of the wing left sometimes
the wing will smudge and it'll be a big
mess and a big wolf it did not do that
with this particular product I really
enjoyed it and this is the first product
I've ever gotten from girl lactic Beauty
so I'm very excited to try more things
from this brand hopefully boxycharm will
send more or I may have to just go out
of my way to try some more things from
this brand because I was very impressed
with this marker white liner a huge fan
of marker eyeliners so this was a
definite win for me now the product I
really really loved was the lvx nail
polish in serene my only complaint about
this is it does take some coats to build
it up but once you've got it on lasting
power for this was really good for me I
would say this took about three to four
days if I remember correctly for it to
chip to the point where I need didn't
feel comfortable wearing it anymore
little chip showing after two days which
is pretty typical for me but then the
bigger chip started showing up for about
four days so that's a decent wear time
for nail polish for me and once you
build this up it is really really pretty
so I was definitely impressed with this
nail polish isn't my favorite nail
polish of all time no but it's a really
good nail polish and I do like this
brand overall for nail polish it's a
really nice brand and the last product
in here is another product that I really
liked it was this cougar diamond kiss
mineral face and body shimmer I'm gonna
put a little bit less on my shoulders
because you can put this anywhere you
want girlfriend and it doesn't have any
glitter in it it's
the shimmer there we go
get a little bit of shimmer there little
bit of shimmer day oh it looks so pretty
but I really like this product it does
feel a little bit gritty I didn't
remember that when I first tried it but
it does feel a little bit gritty but on
the face I didn't notice that I guess
when I apply it with my fingers it just
felt different then when I applied it
with the power to rush to my face and
it's just a really nice healthy glow of
a highlighter it's not a from space
highlighter like it's not like a super
super glowy one but it is pretty glowy I
really enjoyed it and I've again another
brand I'd never heard of and I'm really
excited to try more products from is
this cougar brand just love the name
cougar for a makeup brand it just makes
me happy there's something about that
name that just is ringing true to me I
just like that I don't know maybe it's
my age I don't know alright so boxycharm
for this month would I pay twenty one
dollars for this
yes I would I would for these three
products as I feel like this is worth 15
bucks on its own this is definitely
worth 10 bucks to me this is worth
another 10 to me like if I saw these in
a store and I saw it for $10 I would be
like yes for me I know that they're
worth more than that monetarily but that
would be what I would pay and no
hesitation would pick it up 15 10 and 10
so that beats are $21 price tag so it's
a win for the June box or boxycharm well
done well done so I just opened up my
July box now I haven't used anything in
my July box yet except for one product
cuz it's a product that I already own
from a subscription box a really long
time ago and I can speak to that product
now but as far as the rest I can't speak
to it I haven't even opened this yet
this is done new you know yeah move
divinely natural lip gloss and I haven't
even swatched this or anything I don't
know what the deal is with it so we're
gonna swatch it for the first time
together I did read that this is a
natural bamboo handle which i think is
really cool and the shade is beautiful I
would imagine this looking really pretty
on a lot of skin tones all emo leaf
that's bright
that is bright I'll know about that
let's try it
okay so opacity is not there because it
is a gloss but that might be good
considering this is such a great product
oh I actually really like that it
doesn't feel sticky it feels smooth
rather than sticky and I really like
that actually
I am surprised at how much I like that
because it was so stinking bright don't
really match my eyes do well but that's
okay
I could deal with that I'm alright with
that so yeah a really nice first
impression on this excited about that
and then also when you let me show you
this is the eyeliner that I already own
this is my malli it's the ever color
star light waterproof eyeliner and I'm
actually going to put this in for a
future giveaway this is a really really
nice eyeliner it stays on the lash line
better than the waterline but it's a
beautiful beautiful color really led
that really nice pop to the lower lash
line it's gorgeous
use it a million times so I'm not gonna
open that and swatch that keep picking
this up so I might as well pick it up
this is the Ofra pro it's like they call
it the mmm-hmm
I don't call it a Z palette it's a
magnetic palette and it has one two
three four five six eyes shadows in it
that are connected to this and I really
needed another Z palette II kind of
thing I have some loose magnetic shadows
that I needed a place to put some really
thankful that we got this Z palettes
will run you a good ten to fifteen
dollars so it's really nice to get this
that takes care of a lot of the price
that box and I needed one of these
anyway I have to watch some of these
shadows but I haven't used them on my
eyes yet so I'm not gonna talk about how
I feel about them yet it does say that
the value of this is $59 I can tell you
there's no way I would pay $59 for this
as is but I can see if we're gonna pay
$10 for each of these shadows they
better be really good so stay tuned for
the review of that for next month and
then the last thing in here is okay so
there's only four products in this box I
guess because this has such a high value
this also
has a high value this is from py teen
this is a $30.00 oil argan oil treatment
so dimethicone is the number one
ingredient which is a silicone and the
second ingredient is the argan oil so
I'm curious to try this
I do love PYT as a brand my straightener
that I use is from PYT I got it two
years ago still going strong love my
straightener hashtag not sponsored I
bought it at full price that I match two
years ago but I do like this brand so
I'm curious to try their argan oil
hopefully I love it I would love to love
it I do you feel like thirty dollars is
probably a little overpriced for
dimethicone being the first ingredient
but we shall see if it's amazing
actually let's put someone why not right
can I get it open that's the question
okay don't tell my dentist stopper
that's pretty smart to put a little
stopper in there to make sure that it
doesn't um doesn't spill anywhere I wish
there was some kind of dropper in here
that would be my critique of this the
dropper would be very nice so dime sized
and you guys can see how it looks I'm
going to kind of rub it in my hands warm
it up a little bit
smell is a little weird it smells I
can't place what smell that is it smells
very natural but not in like a dirt kind
of way like enough spicy outdoorsy leafy
kind of way not a dirt way let's say
how's it looking can you tell a
difference I would love to know if you
can tell the difference in the comments
below I feel like I can tell the
difference my hair looks smoother
definitely that looks really good
actually
that's actually quite impressive Wow so
maybe it is worth thirty dollars maybe
I'm gonna try it more and I'll let you
know so thank you so much for watching
