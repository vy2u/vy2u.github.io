review of the februari boxy charm and my
unboxing this thing of the march on a
boxy charm if you've never been to one
of my bouncy charm videos what I do is I
try the products for a full month before
I tell you what I think about them so
even if you don't get boxy charm you can
benefit from the review of the products
and then I show you what will be
reviewed next month boxy charm is sent
to me for review but this is not a
sponsored video and that does not
influence my video in any way I'm always
one hundred percent honest and I try to
approach it as if I had paid the full 21
dollars for the box so let's talk about
the products that we got in the februari
box let's start off with the Z palette I
personally enjoy the V palette format
there was some drama last month with Z
palette and some choices that they made
in handling their customer service so
you can actually look I'll links a
minute down below that talks about what
happened with them and you can kind of
read the drama behind it there are 1
minute long videos if you want to know
what happened but as far as the product
itself I do enjoy Z palette but there
are lots of brand you can purchase from
if you do not want to support V palette
but that's that's up to you or the
appellate is still around if you do want
to support them inside the Z palette i
have put some single pan eyeshadows and
that's the purpose of the Z palette is
to hold magnetic small pans of eyeshadow
you can also do pot I shadows and put
them in here you can take them out of
pallets and put them in here they
actually include magnets inside if you
are so you can do pot I shadows that are
not magnetic and still place them in
your Z palette these little babies right
here or makeup geek eyeshadows i
received the shadow creme brulee and
also the shadow bitten these are
fantastic eyeshadow and happen to really
really love i think that her shadow
formula is spot-on absolutely spot-on i
have never had a bad experience with any
of her eye shadows i did just recently
purchased some of her new lip creme
stain so that video will be coming out
as soon as i get those and have a chance
to try them but anyway these are really
really nice highly recommend definitely
excited to have those to go with those
we got the omnia brushes by royal and
lang
another brand that I really really liked
a lot really langnickel is really coming
up in popularity recently with their
motor brushes the motor brushes are
found at walmart these are their
high-end line so these are supposed to
be similar to like a japanese-style
brush and they're really really nice I
love the way that they apply my shadow I
think they're fantastic they're very
easy to use I'm very thankful to have
them this is the only thing I thought
was kind of mediocre this is the juice
beauty reflecting gloss in fig it's just
kind of an oily gloss nothing really
magical about it has a citrusy kind of
scent it's not opaque in any way but
it's just a bluff I am wearing it over
top of a NARS pencil lipstick right now
and it's fine one thing I do like about
it is it's not very heavy it's not very
sick it's just a very nice light law so
not a negative but nothing that's really
blowing me away about it and the last
thing was the big money product in the
boss this is the dr brandt
microdermabrasion age-defying exfoliator
really really like this product it comes
out as a white cream and then when you
rub it it's got kind of a light sandy
kind of texture to it and it's got just
a little bit of grit to it so it's very
nice it's not super abrasive or anything
it feels good it smells like a like
clean cotton II kind of scent just like
a fresh clean with a tad bit of citrus
it smells very very nice feels great on
the skin I've been using long enough to
really see some big effects of it but it
definitely works for me as an exfoliator
I have really been enjoying using it so
what is box worth $21 to me Thank You
Louie the Z palette itself is really
nice to have the makeup geek eyeshadows
are amazing I really really really like
these eyeshadow brushes and the juice
beauty lip gloss I should probably do
without but it is nice I am going to
keep it i am going to use it but just I
feel like just the 2i shadows and the
two brushes alone to me are worth $21
but then you get the Z palette and you
get this full-size $79 certain dr.
Brandt microdermabrasion I mean this
this box they really knocked it out of
the park on this one good job boxy charm
so now we shall show you what we got in
the more
box which I'm also very excited about
this is a giant fan brush this is the
jumbo kabuki fan by crown brush it is
very very soft I don't think I'm going
to be using this for highlighter which
is what I typically use fan brushes for
I'm not quite sure what I'm going to use
this for maybe contouring maybe blush
but i feel like i don't i don't have
enough real estate over here just be
able to use this as a as a highlight
brush it just would it would go
everywhere i haven't used it yet but I'm
excited to it's very soft I'm excited
about that I'm really excited to try the
naked cosmetics press eye shadows I am
in love with their loose powder eye
shadows I have heard some not-so-great
things from my facebook group it's
facebook.com slash groups last what's up
and make up there some of them were not
very impressed with these press shadows
which makes me really really sad because
I really do love them as a brand again I
haven't tried them yet but I'm really
excited too they swatch really
beautifully so yes I cannot wait to use
this very excited about that I've been
waiting but now I cannot wait any longer
I'm going to be using it this is one
that will probably be passed on to
someone just because I've used this a
million times and I already have an
opinion about it is the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer and then we got
this year this is the real her matte
liquid lipstick and this is the shade I
deserve the best and there is that there
we also got the real fur expert advice
lip liner and this one is in the shade I
am freshest for me I really really like
shades like this they're very very me
these multi colors someone with a deeper
skin tone may find them to be too pink
but I personally really like these
colors so I'm very excited to try them
so so far it looks like it's worth $21
but we'll have to try it for a full
month so make sure that you hit that
