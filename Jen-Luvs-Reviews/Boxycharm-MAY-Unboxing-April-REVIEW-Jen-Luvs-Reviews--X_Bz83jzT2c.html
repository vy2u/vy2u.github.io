review and unboxing we're going to be
reviewing the April box and I'm going to
be showing you what I got in my main box
if you're curious what I have all my
face today I do have a review that I
just filmed of the lorac pirates of the
caribbean dead men tell no tales
collection that will be coming up yes
very excited to show you those things so
that is what i have on my face today so
let's go ahead and talk about boxycharm
box each arm is $21 a month into a
subscription service it's mostly full
size items it is sent to me for review
it's been sent to me for years and years
and years and years and years but that
never influences my review and that's
why I love boxycharm they don't care if
I'm critical of the box they're actually
very thankful when I'm critical of the
box so speaking of being critical of the
box let's talk about what we got in in
the month of April the way I review
these is I think in my brain whether I
if I saw these on a shelf for $21 would
I buy this box so let's go ahead and
start with the hair dirt smoothing
yogurt shampoo I'm actually down to here
on here I haven't even used it that many
times I feel like I need to use so much
of this to clean my hair and may just be
my just brain and thinking the way my
hair feels when it's clean like I feel
like I need to use more of this it just
doesn't come up with a lather and less I
use like a whole handful of it so I
don't know it smells amazing I just feel
like it takes a lot of product to use so
it's not a bad product it just wasn't
other than the scent it just wasn't my
favorite scent is really really good at
smells like strawberry banana yogurt it
smells amazing the concealer palette oh
and a concealer palette so when I unbox
this last month I had quite a few people
telling me Jen just so you know you can
get that concealer palette at five below
five below as a store kinda like the
dollar store if you don't have it but
everything's $5 and under and I was like
oh that's interesting and if you open it
up it looks like something you might buy
at five below some of the pans are a
little bit dented the way that they sit
inside the cardboard it just looks kind
of cheap but I did have a pretty good
experience with this I tried using it
for lots of different things because as
someone that's not a makeup artist I
only have one skin tone to use this on
so I don't necessarily need all of these
shades as a person with just one skin
tone so I try these for lots of things
I tried this one as a brow gel and it
actually worked pretty well for me so if
your hair is any of these colors you can
try it as a brow gel and see how you
like it I also use some of them as
eyeshadow primers now I did find that
occasionally they would crease on these
if you have oily lids you may not want
to do that but if you have dry lids it
may be something for you to use these as
eyeshadow primers and it's kind of fun
to start off with a different kind of
base so I did have fun playing with this
what I pay the $19 that they say that
this thing $20 they say this thing is
worth no I wouldn't pay $20 for it okay
5 I thought it's worth 5 dollars to me
at 5 blow you know it's not terrible but
it's not great okay the pure sponges
when I unbox this last month I mentioned
that I had gotten sent the pink one from
pure and I did not like it it was too
hard for me and many people said to me
they said Jen you just have to keep
trying it it's really really good and I
realized that they were absolutely right
I've been using the yellow one and I
think they're all the same I don't think
there's any difference except for the
color but I found that after I used it
multiple times it's softened up the more
I used it I use it today I'm really
enjoying them they're not quite as soft
as the Beautyblender or the older
version of the Beauty Blender but I do
really like it I think it was a great
thing to get in the box especially
getting three of them and not just one I
would imagine most subscription boxes
would just include one but three I think
it's kind of going above and beyond I'm
going to go ahead and remove my lip
product and put on the allegory story
lip gloss so you can see it so this is
the lip gloss by a laborious Tori the
shade is called Plato's cave and I
really like this lip gloss a lot I like
my lip glosses to have some color and
some pigment to them and I really like
the pigment in this lip gloss I love the
way that it looks on me I like the tone
of it and I love the opacity of it that
it's not super opaque like a liquid
lipstick but it's got just a nice shine
to it it's really really pretty it's not
sticky at all
does have a very light sweet scent but
it's not obnoxiously sweet I do really
like this lip gloss a lot it's that
that's worth $15 e I might pay $15 for
this I feel like I would be comfortable
at 12 a 15 kind of makes me go a little
bit but I don't think that 15 is an
outrageous price tap for this I'm really
enjoying it a lot and the last thing o
Rodeo Drive by overall is like yeah
Oprah has fantastic highlighters a lot
of people talk about their little
lipsticks which are also fantastic but
their highlighters are amazing they're
so glowy and beautiful if you like those
pop in from space highlighters they're
perfect and I really love the shade so
very very thankful to get it last in
power on Oprah highlighters is wonderful
it lasts really really nice on my cheeks
and I love it I love the shade I love
the texture of it I love the shine of it
there's nothing bad to say about this
highlighter I love it it's beautiful I
was very happy to see it in here so what
is this box worth $21 I think you
already know yeah definitely it was
worth $21 I feel like these products
right here makes the $21 the sponges the
highlighter and the lip gloss together
this is well over $21 just for these
three things I would pay $45 without
thinking twice I would grab this for $45
just these products right here these
products here are just kind of bonus for
me I'm happy that I got to try them but
I definitely wouldn't go out of my way
to get them so now that I've told you
about a roll let me go ahead and show
you what we got in May so I'll be able
to show you what I will be reviewing
next month actually no I won't be
reviewing you next month I unfortunately
won't be able to do a boxycharm
unboxing in June because the time that I
normally film I will be in New York
Toronto and Montreal with my family so
you will see this box return in the
month of July so in July you'll be able
to see the May box review the June box
reviewed and the July box unboxed so the
theme this month is makeup is art and I
have not touched any of this
this is sitting here and I just haven't
gone to its I'm really excited to kind
of give you a first impression because I
don't even remember within this box
first thing in here is a crown brush I
don't know what are these what are these
things called what it was the official
name for these things okay this is
called a round contour brush by crown
Pro and it's one of those RT style
brushes it's got a nice bend to it it's
not overly Bengie I do really like this
style of brush so I'm really excited to
try this I hope it works out well I'm
crossing my fingers next we have this
here from the brow gal by Tanja rooks
and it says brown hair which I do have
which is nice I'm not sure if they sent
everybody brown hair
hopefully the individualÃ­s I heard
there's a survey now this is called the
convertible brow whoo so this is kind of
interesting so it says that it is a
powder pomade duo that you can use it
dry as a brow powder and you can use it
wet as a brow pomade which is very very
interesting I like that they gave so
many shades so that it can call them at
many different hair colors I'll
definitely be using this dark one over
here but I'm really excited to use this
this is cool and then this little thing
over it says do your face a favor so I'm
excited to try that and then this goes
with it this is the brow brush it is
relatively stiff it's not quite as stiff
as I like for a brow brush but I think
it's going to work just fine I think
this is going to work nicely as an
eyeliner brush as well as an angled
eyeliner brush and it's got the spoolie
on the other side so I'm very thankful
that they gave that to go with it so
that it could be used as that that brow
pomade that's going to be really fun to
play with okay also in here is the
temptu and boxycharm liquid glow I
thought a bronzer from temptu and I was
very skeptical of it and I was kind of
like these with using machines I'd use
some of these things before and I was
kind of like right I really like the
bronzer I was shocked how much I liked
the bronzer so I'm very excited to try
this highlighter it's a very pretty
shade and then we got a highlighting
contour palette by Abby Beauty it's open
this baby up
okay create your look and it's got a
little look card here which is nice to
explain how to use it and then whew
these shades are pretty they're very
cool tone though so if you're more of a
warm toned person then this may
not be for you but it's beautiful I like
that they've done they're all mad it
looks like and there's lighter these two
don't look too much different from each
other this one looks a little more
yellow tone this is a little more peach
tone and then we've got three different
contour shades I also don't feel like
this is very very dark of a contour I
feel like this is very light skin tone
friendly which kind of bums me out if
they're going to do three shades I wish
that they had done like a light a medium
and a deep instead of a light a lighter
and a lightest and though my being is
that as a tall space I feel like it's
kind of I don't know I mean I'm happy
I'm thankful because it's going to work
for me but I just go bad for people that
these are not dark enough for for
contour shades I don't know maybe they
had different options for different
people but but yeah I'm excited for it I
just wish that it was a little more dark
skin friendly so this does look like
it's going to be worth twenty one
dollars but I haven't tried anything yet
so I'll have to let you know and give
you a jam-packed video in July because
you're going to be able to see May June
and July all in the same video which I'm
excited to share with you so definitely
