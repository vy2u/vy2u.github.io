enough and Fran Fran didn't you guys
remember that song I don't know hello my
friends welcome to my boxycharm mega
review slash showing you what I got in
my June box things got a little crazy
end of the school year and I apologize
that I'm getting this out to you so late
I'm so late doing this video that I got
my June box and this is the thing I'm
actually going out on vacation for three
weeks starting end of June so I will not
get my July box until the middle to end
of July so this video it'll probably be
just like this in August so you will see
the review of the June box and the July
box in August after I get my August box
shipped to me so it'll be another mega
reviews to make sure you subscribe so
you don't miss that in case you don't
know boxycharm is $21 per month I do get
this as a promotional subscription which
means I don't pay for it but I always
promise you my honest review boxycharm
knows that I'm going to be honest and
they sent it to me anyway which makes it
says a lot about boxycharm
as a company amazing people working over
there the owner is a stand-up dude Hey
Joe how you doing and and I appreciate
that they love me just the way I am so
enough talking about me let's get into
talking about these boxes when I look at
my box to trim' and I evaluate it and I
think about it I think would I pay $21
if I saw this these items just sitting
on a shelf in a box for $21 would I buy
it that's the kind of the standard I'm
looking for an out box you try them if
you've ever seen unboxings before always
has way more than 21 dollars worth in
monetary value but where the products
good enough for me that's what we're
gonna talk about right now so the first
thing in here was a full size of this
Anderson Lilly Manhattan Beach Beach
butter hand cream this is the coastal
collection and I can tell you I really
like this as a cream as a hand cream but
I did not enjoy the smell it smells it's
got a beachy kind of scent to it which
is really cool that they start they sent
out like a beachy scent but it's just
not it reminds me of something that we
more of like a candle scent rather than
a hand
so if you like those fresh clean candles
that's what this smells like and I just
don't enjoy that as a hand cream I'm
more of a Ferdie girl so this is a
personal preference thing it's certainly
not a bad hand cream it just doesn't fit
my personal preference another thing
that did not fit my personal preferences
was the pur Lisse daily lip Noire sure
with mango and shea butter pur Lisse is
a really nice brand unfortunately I did
not enjoy this it was really really oily
like really oily on my lips it didn't
like the way it felt I prefer more of a
creamy lip balm I really like coconut
oil base lip products ones that are a
little more solid a little less like
oily you know so this one wasn't didn't
fit my taste either unfortunately the
next thing that I didn't feel was super
effective was the blank of black lash
primer now the the whole thing with
blank is that you're supposed to be able
to take just plain water it's a they
have tubing mascara you're supposed to
take just plain warm water and that is
what takes off the mascara at the end of
the day I just didn't see a lot of
effectiveness and when I layered mascara
over top of it and I do have a blank
mascara that I purchased off of
HauteLook that I layered over top of it
and I just didn't see a lot of effect
for it so I personally wouldn't purchase
this that's just me and my lashes maybe
if you have naturally long lashes you
may see more of an effect I have very
short sparse lashes so this did not have
a big effect for me unfortunately I do
like the idea that it's black though
because sometimes the white eyelash
primers that are supposed to enhance the
effect of your mascara sometimes those
are difficult to cover up so I love that
it's black I just didn't find it
effective my favorite product in here
was the ofra liquid lipstick in Pasadena
this is such a beautiful shade I
actually already own this in an older
version older packaging of it and I
really love it a lot
I love the over liquid lipsticks there
are a wonderful formula they're kind of
on the Moosey side but they're not over
drying at all they do they aren't
transfer proof they will transfer but
the lasting power on them is really good
they fade pretty nicely they don't leave
you with this weird disgusting like worn
off look they fade down really
beautifully I just love the Ofra formula
I definitely recommend it this was
definitely my favorite thing in the box
and then
last thing in here I really wish that I
had used more I only used it one time
and I did enjoy it when I used it but I
wish that I'd used it more than one time
this is brown hypnotic by your minerals
and it's just a loose mineral eyeshadow
it is absolutely gorgeous it's got this
it's like a maroon shade with different
sparkles in it like you know pink and
maybe even a little bit of green in
there maybe that I can see I'm pretty
sure I see a little bit of green it's
really hard to tell what is happening in
here because it is so complex it's
really really beautiful and really fun I
did use this in the outer corner of one
eye look and I really enjoyed the
lasting power was great I really wish
I'd use this more and I'm kicking myself
for forgetting to use that I got a lot
of new eyeshadow products this month and
I just liked it and I feel sad so
looking at this box do I feel like this
was worth $21 to me no this was not
worth $21 because the only products I
truly enjoyed were these two products
and probably monetarily these two are
worth $21 but I if I saw these two
things together in a store for $21 I
probably wouldn't purchase them so let's
go ahead and go into the next box which
was May's box Oh in case you were
wondering my own my lips today I have
back up it's a matte X by color pop is
the first time I've used it I really
really like it a lot I'm super happy
with it that's off topic though let's
get back on sorry maze box was really
really good let me talk about the thing
that I like the least first and this is
the brow gal by Tanja crooks
it is a clear water-resistant eyebrow
gel I agree it is clear I agree as
water-resistant I will also add
information that it is super duper uber
crunchy like it feels terrible it feels
really awful when you go like this dry
brows it's super crunchy very similar to
the honest Accio brown gel but I think
this is a little crunchy err it does
hold my brows in place it's effective
it doesn't flake like you would think
like you know when you have like crunchy
hairspray in your hair and it feels
crunchy like and you scratch your head
and it looks like you've got dandruff
because you're just flaking everywhere
this doesn't do that so that's a good
thing but I don't like the feel of it so
I would pass on this even though it's
effective and I just don't like the
current
the crunchy bothered the next thing it's
really just the shade this is the double
ego dual-ended eyeliner by pure minerals
okay I already own this - this is how
big of a makeup addict I am I get
subscription boxes I already have some
of the products I already own this this
this is mine I've had it for a good
solid six months at least and it's still
going pretty strong I've only used it a
handful of times just because of the
shade it's it's a bright teal ish blue
color and it's just it's a little
extreme for me but I have had great luck
with this product I really enjoy the
formula of it you get a rollup pencil on
one side and then on the other side you
get a liquid and I've used this on my
upper lash line and gotten so many
compliments on the looks that I've done
with this it's just a really nice
product the wing if I if I do a wing
with it the the marker will wipe off but
not in a super messy way but I got to
kind of keep an eye on that if you're
gonna be rubbing your eyes it doesn't
really stay all day but all my lids it
stayed all day because I don't really
rub the tops of my eyes or who they have
sometimes you know you look it's going
on here and you rub your eyes this will
come off overall it's a great product
it's just the shade is a little bit I'm
not gonna use this all the time kind of
shade but it's a good program the one
that I liked a lot with the siema
or Catherine Malandrino a romance de
Provence and this was kind of a bonus
thrown in this wasn't even really
considered to be part of the box this is
a very warm vanilla with a little bit of
fruitiness a little bit of floral but
what I really smell is vanilla I don't
know what the actual notes are in here
let me read it let's see if I'm close it
says nuances of pear and blackcurrant at
the heart jasmine rose and velvet
blossoms bloom on a groom on base of
vanilla patchouli and tonka bean so I'm
surprised that we would get this in in a
spring box but I'm definitely not going
to complain and I will still be wearing
it even though it's more I would say
this is for me is more of like a fall
winter scent but really liked it a lot
and lasting power was typical a couple
of hours before I would need to reapply
this is pretty generous size for an
extra bonus products I'm very impressed
with all right next up star looks
charmed ultra
we're lip pencil it says star star looks
heart boxycharm it's just this nudie
roll-up lip pencil I use this once I'm
not a lipliner person I don't feel
comfortable reviewing lip liners because
I don't have enough experience using lip
liners it went on creamy it did what
it's supposed to do as a lip liner but I
don't really have anything else to say
about it did it change blow my mind and
change my life no but it's a nice lip
liner I really enjoyed using it a couple
times that I used it my favourite
products in here were these two here oh
my gosh let's save this one for last I
like got chills thinking about these two
products because I love them so much
alright this I had never heard of this
is the ella plus Milla bonbon nail
polish Impa stash this is a fabulous
nail polish I'm telling you this lasted
close to a week without serious chips
like it was like my juleps I don't know
how much what is the retail price on
this thing 10:50 oh my gosh totally
would pay 1050 for this thing totally oh
my gosh and it was opaque in really one
coat but I pushed it to 2 I always like
to do 2 but oh my gosh so many
compliments on my nails when I did this
I did a little bit of nail stamping with
it really enjoyed the way that it looked
in the lasting power it was so good but
my favorite thing in here well no you
know what I liked the nail polish better
but I do really like this too this is a
great great product this is the new
formula of the makeup geek blush this is
in the shade XOXO really really nice
really nice Marlina did a fantastic job
on this formula you just have to be kind
of gentle with it because it does it is
very very pigmented so you want to go
light at first and then build from there
but it's a really nice formula actually
definitely lost this for a little while
so I used it a few times and took a
break from it and then used it again and
just really really nice formula I'm
excited to get more of these at some
point because really loving it so when I
pay twenty one dollars for this oh heck
yeah I would pay $21 this book I loved
this box this thing was super duper fab
I mean just these two alone these two
and
the perfume like I would pay $21 for
these three things adding in the
lipliner and the eyeliner like I liked
all of these things I didn't like this
this one thing but $21 oh yes oh yes
please
yes please I would pay $21 I would pay
18 for these two it's really close I
would the 80 for these two but I liked
all these things too so yes go to one
boxycharm that was a good one I like
nice so let me go ahead and jump in and
show you what I got in June and this is
what I will be reviewing for you in
August when I get back from my vacate my
July box until I get home here we go
y'all ready for this dinner a fan Fran
Frannie you guys remember that song I
don't know so first thing in here I'm
gonna show you the thing I'm least
excited about these what I will not
review because I have not tried them yet
this is the pharmacy hydrating coconut
gel mask lovely some coconut hate me
some face man yes I try them for the
channel but I absolutely hate them I
don't like the way they feel in my face
I don't like anything goopy on my face
it bothers me like I don't mind like the
mud masks and like things that you put
on your favorite cream masks and things
like that but anything that's goofy or
sloppy or slippy hmm but I'll try it
anyway I'll try it anyway and you do get
I think a few of them in here let me
open this I haven't even opened this yet
so you get three of these face masks are
they all the same yes they're all the
same so I will probably use one of these
and then pass the rust along so they
have rich purple broccoli extract very
interesting but not exciting for me
personal taste okay this one I actually
tried but I'm gonna hold the review
because I've only used it twice
this is Agra lactic Beauty precise
eyeliner marker in black you are it is a
pen marker it is a marker tip it is not
a brush tip I can tell you though it is
blackity black black black but I want to
use it more before I review it but I can
tell you this is right up my alley makes
me super happy Oh FRA pressed powder oil
control now I don't have Whaley skins so
I don't need it for oily control Whaley
control I don't need it for oily control
I don't need this for oil control but I
do need that
mattifying 'no so i will be using this
and i will be seeing if it helps to
mattify my face after foundation ok this
is looks really fun this is the Cougar
mineral face and body shimmer and
diamond kiss and I'm actually very
excited about this I'm considering
taking this on my vacation but I
probably won't because I'm scared that
mineral is just not going to be smart to
pack but it's this gold glittery dust
stuff that I think is gonna be really
fun to use during the summer time for
that glow for that sunkissed glow so I
think that would be fun I love that it's
called cougar around alright last thing
is probably the thing I'm most excited
about this is the lvx or level X I
forgot how you say it lvx nail lacquer
and this is in the shade I don't know
you open it
serene and it's this beautiful dusty
blue shade and I'm very excited about it
just looking at it I can tell you okay
I came off looking at it I can tell you
this is probably a one to two coat
polish it's very very thick I can barely
see the brush bristles through it so I
think this is gonna be really good as
far as application but we'll see about
where time and I will let you know in
August so that's it for the june box
