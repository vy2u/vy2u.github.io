review of the october box and my
unboxing ish thing of the november box
if you've never been here - one of my
subscription boxes you will find out
quickly that it is very different than
most subscription box openings in that I
spend a lot of time reviewing the
previous month's box I've had a month to
try these things and that way you know
whether the products are worth it to you
if you pay for a subscription you don't
want to just pay for it to get product
you want to get product that's actually
good so that's why I review the previous
month's box and then I show you what's
going to be reviewed at next month
boxycharm is $21 a month it is sent to
me for review but this is not a
sponsored video if you would like to
support the channel my boxycharm link is
down below
I do earn a very small amount of money
if you sign up using my link or you can
just go to boxycharm com whatever makes
you happy same price either way just one
help support the channel the other one
you just go there but it's totally up to
you whatever you choose to do but I do
want to make sure you know that this
does not influence my review at all I
will be 100% always honest with you like
I always am so let's go ahead and jump
into the October box
the October box was really good very
much enjoy it so there's one product
that I don't have anymore and I feel
really really bad about it I believe I
left it in San Francisco when I went for
Generation Beauty I think I left it
there because I ever since I got back
from San Francisco I cannot find it and
it is the starlooks ultra matte lip
paint I do remember quite well what I
thought about the ultra matte lip paint
I remember it going on very easily I do
remember it being slightly sticky I do
remember it being slightly drying I do
remember it wearing down not so great I
did put a lip balm in my pocket
eventually that's kind of what I do with
drying liquid lipsticks I wait until
they start looking kind of yuck and then
I put a lip balm over them and it kind
of blends everything together takes away
the matte finish but it blends
everything together helps it to wear
down evenly something worried about
reapplying the liquid lipstick I just
apply that balm over it and it fades
down a lot more gracefully that's what
happened with this liquid lipstick it is
worth $19 I would not pay $19 for it but
I wouldn't pay night
dollars from most higher and liquid
lipsticks because most of them I
honestly don't enjoy
I would probably pay eight dollars for
at nine dollars something like that but
I definitely wouldn't pay 19 for it now
that's getting the products that I
really like this is dubrio geo rose Arco
blow dried perfection and heat
protectant cream no sulfates no
silicones no parabens yes I really like
this product a lot my friend Erica of
repeating the vlog got this in her
boxycharm as well she did not like it
she has very she has much she's a lot
more hair than I think she has thinner
hair but it's she has a lot of it so it
did not work for her it works great for
my thin hair I speaking of and there
goes my boxycharm I've tried a few
products from Rio Gio in the past and
did not enjoy them I've tried their
their hair mask a couple of times I
tried another product for them that I
can't even remember but every time I see
something from this brand I'm always
kind of like you know because they
haven't had a hit for me oh my goodness
how much do I love this this has
replaced pretty much every product in my
hair routine because it does everything
for me it's smooth hair enhancer shine
tames friends frizz and as a heat
protectant it does all of that for me I
did use it today when I got on the show
and I love this stuff I love it because
it's so easy I just put it on my damp
hair and I'm done with all the products
I don't use any other product except for
a little bit of hairspray when I'm done
curling my hair but that's it love love
love love love this stuff another thing
I absolutely loved in this was the Luxy
brush set they gave us three lucky
brushes I mean $21 a month you're gonna
pay at least $10 for each of these
brushes how much does it cost
yeah the Luxy brush set is $36 and I
would pay $36 for these they're so so
nice my favorite one here I don't know I
guess pie my favourite one is the luxe
II 231 small taper blending this one's
really really good for getting color up
into the crease and then I blend it out
with this one this is the 229 tapered
blending I like this because it's got a
nice density to it but it's also got a
little bit of a fluffiness to it so that
it moves the product but also is
blending I mean it's just this pair is
fabulous this one I find to be a little
bit too fluffy for my personal taste
this is the 205 tapered
it's just a little too fluffy it doesn't
really move the product the way that I
want it to it just kind of you know it
feels nice but for deeper colors like
they'd have them trying to blend up on
my brow bone it just is not efficient
but these two are money right here
they're amazing another product that I
was surprised that I liked was the
temptu bronzer I was really surprised
basically what I do with this is I put
it on my fingertips and then I Pat it
onto my cheeks or I've dropped this on
to a bronzer brush and apply just a
little streak on each side and then
blended it out and it really gives you
that sunkissed kind of glow I know it's
wintertime here in the United States but
it gives you that really beautiful
sunkissed glow I'm definitely gonna be
using this more in the summertime but I
really like the way this looks it says
that you can contour with it but it has
a shimmer so I wouldn't recommend
contouring with it but I do really like
it on my cheeks it makes a nice base for
that warm in from the cold kind of blush
and I just really like this a lot very
much caught me off guard I did not think
I was gonna like it lasting power was
pretty decent last throw regular you
know maybe 4 to 6 hours before it starts
fading and then by the end of a worker
school day it's going to be pretty gone
but it lasts a good while I do really
enjoy it another thing that I've been
enjoying is the it'd be beautiful it
okay good it's not broken I just dropped
it so I'm glad it's something broken
jiggling here it does come with a little
sponge applicator in here and it is what
I'm wearing on my eyes today I do really
like these shades a lot they're all very
beautiful I love that they put this like
transition color here and then they've
got this beautiful gold you can put on
your lid and then this one can be used
as a highlight
I do wish it was four pans and they had
a matte brown shade in here and then it
would be just Oh perfect but can't have
everything it's a trio it's gonna be
what it'll be so I did supplement it
today with the meet matrimony palette
lasting power on this is a full work or
school day lasts a good six to eight
hours before significant fading but it
is not going to last into the evening it
is going to need reapplication for the
evening but I do really like it very
creamy very high-quality I'm really
looking forward to seeing more from this
brand I've never heard of this brand so
I'm excited to see it so that was it for
the october boxycharm so overall my
least favorite thing was the liquid
lipstick
definitely did not enjoy that as much
even though I loved the color the
eyeshadow palette was great but I
probably will be passing it on to
somebody because I have a lot of shades
that look exactly like this and I just
know I'm not going to reach for it so
I'll pass this on to someone I do like
the bronzer a lot I don't know how much
I'm going to use it but I'm definitely
going to keep it especially for summer
and I am in love with the Luxy brushes
and I am in love with the Brio geo hair
product they're all fantastic oh so I do
I feel like this was worth $21 it's
without a doubt absolutely I knew just
these two these two sets of things these
two definitely make it 21 this pushes it
over this pushes it over I mean all of
these I would definitely if I saw this
on a shelf for $21 I would totally buy
it I would think it was a super super
steal so very happy the October box
let's move on to the November box if you
thought that was good wait till you see
November oh my goodness okay let me just
preface this by saying that I did
already film this video once I'm not
gonna go into why but I had to refill
mint so I put this liquid lipstick on on
my hand about two hours ago something
like that now or two hours ago
and it will not come off my hand it will
not come off it will not so I'm curious
to see what's going to happen on my lips
I'll show you the product it is called
bellapierre kiss proof lip cream kiss
proof it's like somebody's gonna I can
beat on myself it's still gonna stay
there it's insane so I'm curious to see
how this is gonna last on the lips it
smells like some kind of sour candy it's
very very odd scent I've never smelled
anything like this it's not Pixy Stix
and it's not like skittles I don't know
what it is but it's like a sour candy
smell it's very awful very very odd but
I cannot wait to try this on my lips
it's like a me color totally a me color
I remember I went to the bite Beauty lab
with my friend Yesenia and we both tried
on lipsticks of this shade she has that
deep beautiful latina color and this
looked like a Barbie pink almost on her
but it looked like a mauve on me like
these kinds of shades so if you're a
deeper skin tone it's gonna look very
different than it does on me but but it
can still look very very beautiful but I
this is like me and in a tube the shade
here I love it
another thing I found in here that I
really really like the way it looks but
I haven't tried it is this crown brush
it's the c5 13 and we see what they call
it they call it the pro detail crease
brush and I have two other brushes I
have one my beauty junkies and one by
Wayne Goss and I love these these are
great for detailing up in the crease
open crease very good for detailing up
in there or kind of packing color into
the outer V also can be used for lower
lash line just a really really nice
shape of a brush it feels great
let me see if it's synthetic okay it is
it looks like it's animal hair I don't
know what a capra is I should probably
look that up what a camera is I'm gonna
look it up Capra hair we're gonna find
out right now
okay Capra or goat hair makeup Russia so
this is a goat hairbrush just so you
know so if you are vegan you do not want
to use this brush so this brush is
$12.99 and I will keep you posted I'll
let you know how it goes next thing in
here that I'm very excited about is this
skin Iceland solutions for stressed skin
Icelandic or leaf eye cream I have tried
this multiple times I got this I believe
I got a sample of in a subscription box
once and I fell in love with it I fell
in love with it so much then I went to
Ulta and I got one of those bags where
they have a bunch of the different
products from the brand and I got a ton
of products and what I found with this
is it definitely deep puffed my eyes in
the morning it's got like a cooling
sensation to it I did really enjoy using
it so I'm so so excited to have another
one I already know I love this two more
things in here the next one is a blush
it's vintage by Jessica something I'm
not going to butcher illuminating face
highlighter and highlighter yes
highlighter illuminating face
highlighter and it looks like this and
it is very pink and it's got a gold
shift to it it's very very pretty I am
curious to see how this is gonna look on
the cheeks because it is so light
I don't know I'm curious it almost looks
like it has almost a mannish kind of
finish but then it's got that gold shift
to it really curious about this product
I cannot wait
music and then the last thing I'm so
excited about I think this is gonna be
worth the $21 on its own if it's
anything like it's a big sister that
came in the not big sister but its
sister that came in another boxycharm
two months ago this is the studio makeup
on-the-go eyeshadow palette the last one
we got was more natural tones Browns and
peachy shades and things like that
this one is purples and I love purples I
love they included a purple because
purple shades go well for any eye color
green eyes makes them pop blue eyes make
them pop looks really nice for brown
eyes and hazel eyes I mean anybody can
wear purple and it'll be beautiful so I
cannot wait to use this I love that they
included a cooler tone because there's
so much warm tone out there it's so nice
to have a cooler tone palette so cannot
wait for this the other palette actually
actually made it into the top of my
monthly favorites I think it was number
two and my countdown where I go from ten
to one worst product all the way up to
the best that I think it was number two
in October the other palette so I'm
really excited about that
so looking at this I think it's
definitely gonna be worth $21 just in
that I am pretty sure I'm going to love
these this one seems amazing and I'm so
excited about this and depending on
whether you're vegan or not when they
have issues with the goat hair or not
this looks really really nice so very
excited to review that next month if you
