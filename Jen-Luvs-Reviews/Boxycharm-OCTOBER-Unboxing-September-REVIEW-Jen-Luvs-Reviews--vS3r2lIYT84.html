the September boxy charm and my unboxing
ish thing of the October boxy charm I
don't call it unboxing because I've
already unboxed it and looked at
everything so it's not technically an
unboxing but I'm still gonna show you
what I got in my October box and what
I'll be reviewing next month so the way
that this works is I show you what I got
in my September box I tell you how I
felt about everything so even if you
don't get boxycharm you'll be able to
decide whether this is something you'd
like to go ahead and out and purchase
boxycharm is $21 a month I am sent this
for review but as always that does not
influence my review at all I am still
honest with you no matter what because
it is not useful to you it's not useful
to boxycharm it is not useful to the
brand's if I lie so I will not be lying
today I'll be telling you the truth
about all of these products the first
one we're going to start with is this
eyeshadow palette it is the studio
makeup on the go I shadow palette I am
wearing it on my eyes today and I have
to tell you I really really enjoy this a
lot it does pick up some powder but not
an obnoxious amount not as much as let's
say a lorac palette but it does pick up
some powder it is very easy to use
overall I feel like some of the deeper
shades are a bit more difficult to blend
especially this one I found very
difficult to blend once it was on the
eye it was difficult to get the shadow
to move around it kind of stained
immediately so just be careful with this
one in placing it where you would like
for it to go but overall I've really
enjoyed these lasting power on these
shadows is very very good I would say it
holds up to my Too Faced shadows as far
as the lasting power I don't feel like
it lasts as long as the lorac and the
Kat Von D but it does it because there
is significant fading by the end of the
day but it will last you through a
worker school day and it will look great
by the end of that worker school day if
you don't wash your makeup off until
you're about to go to bed you will see
significant fading with this product one
thing I want to say about this is that I
feel like the shade selection is
fantastic I love that they've got a nice
mix of lights mediums and deeps so that
it kind of work for any skin tone I did
say here's somebody talking about how
this is very similar to the Make Up For
Ever eyeshadow palette the nudes
eyeshadow palette and I find this one to
be a lot more
then that one I'm looking at a picture
right now of it and it looks like it's
pretty cool overall I don't own it so I
can't compare it side-by-side but it
definitely doesn't look like it's the
same it's a very similar setup but it's
definitely not the same and this is
definitely a recommend from me to you if
you're looking for an eyeshadow palette
not from a big mainstream brand next up
in here let's talk about the pure lip
ler hydrating lip lacquer I got this one
in the shade mystic it is a deep berry
shade it is extremely opaque extremely
pigmented definitely need a lip liner
with this one I feel like without a lip
liner I just would have a huge mess of
it all over the place because it is so
deep and so opaque it also fades down
pretty icky during the day meaning that
it doesn't fade down gracefully because
of that opacity it just kind of you know
it wears off in the middle and not the
outside so you definitely want to keep
this on hand if you're going to be
eating or drinking anything to make sure
that it's not fading unevenly like you
may even want to wipe it off before you
eat and then reapply after eating just
to be safe so you don't look crazy while
you're in the middle of a conversation
with somebody at dinner but yeah I mean
overall I feel like it's a great product
as far as the way that it initially
looks to go on and as long as you're
careful with it it's fantastic but you
know with practicality I don't feel like
it's an extremely practical product as
far as the actual wear of it and the way
that you have to be careful with it nor
for it to stay looking good let's talk
about the high khari the eye liner I did
not use this because I have so many
black eyeliners already open it would be
ashamed to use it a couple of times and
then have it go to waste
so I did not use this I have used Hikari
eyeliners in the past and I find them to
be not my favorites they tend to run
down if I put them on my lower lash line
they tend to run down they stay a little
bit better on the upper lash line I'm
not one that prefers a pencil liner on
my upper lash line I prefer a liquid
eyeliner or a pen liner so I don't
really use this on my upper lash line so
that's another reason why I didn't want
to use it I'd rather give to someone
that does enjoy pencil liners on their
upper lash line because this would
really good for that but unfortunately
the lower lashline it does tend to run
on me and give me raccoon eyes and I
don't really enjoy it so that's is that
and then the butter LONDON nail polish I
really really liked this is in the shade
yummy mummy to thick coats or three thin
coats for full opacity for this I did
not find this to chip very easily lasted
a good four or five days before I needed
to take it off because it was
significantly chipped first shift tap
chips happened about two days in which
for me is pretty good I'm pretty rough
on my nails
so this is a definite recommend for me
if you like the shade I personally
really really like a nice nude nail
shade every once in a while I really
like this one a lot and then lastly the
hair Girt strawberry-banana smoothing
hair mask the smell of this is
absolutely incredible if you open up a
couple Yoplait strawberry-banana and you
smell it it smells exactly like this it
smells fantastic now here's the downside
it doesn't work at least for me it did
not work i went from using my not
macadamia what is it the Moroccan oil I
have a big tub of the Moroccan oil hair
mask I stopped using that to use this
there was a noticeable difference in the
crunchiness and the lack of softness
especially in my ends where my hair is
dyed it felt pretty terrible it
definitely didn't give me the hydration
that the Moroccan oil one does I also
enjoy the macadamia one if you want a
form of reference of what I do enjoy
this did not work for me I did follow
the directions I left it on I tried my
best and I did not like it even though
it smells amazing I may use this just
for our regular hair conditioner before
I put on my mask but I'm definitely not
impressed with this as a mask
unfortunately because it really smells
good and I love the way it smells but it
doesn't work so that's a big no for me
unfortunately so as far as my final
opinion do I feel at this box is worth
$21 I definitely do I feel like the
eyeshadow palette is amazing I also feel
like the nail polish is amazing these
two alone for me are worth twenty one
dollars but if these two are not worth
it to you for 21 dollars you may not
think this was worth 21 I do feel like
this is worth just a little bit even
though you know what I probably won't
use this just because of the wear
down of it I'm not high maintenance like
that like I can't keep up with it I'm
doing things I don't have to worry about
whether my lips look like doodoo or not
you know I don't want to worry about it
so I probably will not continue to use
this I'll probably pass it along to
someone that doesn't care that it's
already used the high khari eyeliner is
a note for me and the hair mask is a
note for me so this one is just barely
worth $21 for me to be completely honest
based on the review of the product so
let's go ahead and jump into the October
box I can show you what I'll be
reviewing next month so this one looks
really really good I mean boxycharm
always looks really good I was really
excited about this one I was so excited
out the hair mask I'm totally bummed
about that but this one I actually used
today for the first time but I'm not
ready to fully review it this is the
bri-bri ojio Ross Caro Ross Caro
I don't know blow-dry perfection and
heat protectant cream no sulfates no
silicones no parabens I love the concept
of this in that you put it all over your
wet hair you dry it your heat protected
your conditioned all of that stuff it
just says that it is it's a nourishing
blend of rosehip argan and coconut oils
to smooth hair and hands shine tame
frizz and he protects against damage up
to 425 degrees also it's supposed to
help strengthen your hair and help
prevent split ends so this sounds like a
miracle product to me I did use it today
I do feel like so far so good but I
definitely want to play with it more
before a full review and if this stuff
works this may replace many products in
my hair routine so I'm very much hoping
that this works the next thing in here
is the luxe EAJA blender brush pack oh
my gosh I am in love with Lux II brushes
like they are so good I have not opened
this yet I have not used them yet I have
a feeling I probably already own some of
these and if I do these will end up in a
giveaway bag okay so they gave us the
237 blending brush the tapered blending
brush which is the 205 and the tapered
blending which is the 229 so it looks
like they're just slightly different in
size the 205 looks slightly larger than
229 but they look like they're the same
shape it's just the bristles are a
little bit longer on this one and there
they go out just a little bit wider and
of course this one is smaller this one
is going to
fun for like detailed blending I'm
really looking forward to using this one
very excited about that
Lexi brushes are amazing if you've never
tried them a highly recommends this
might make it worth that $21 just by
itself okay next we got a product by
temptu now when I see temptu I
automatically think that it's supposed
to be for airbrushing and not having an
airbrush kit I feel like this is kind of
a strange product to include it says
that you can dab ejoute a few drops of
the product with clean fingers on the
synthetic bronzer brush and apply where
the Sun naturally hits the face
cheekbones forehead bridge of the nose
and chin you can also use this in a
tinted moisturizer and a foundation
targeted in certain places you can use
it you know things like that so we'll
see I haven't tried it I haven't even
open it yet so we'll see what happens
with this I'm crossing my fingers that's
what I'm very excited about this is the
star looks peak womp
matte lip paint I believe that's the
shade pick home pick cool my French
sorry French people I'm sorry my butcher
in your language I'm so sorry
okay I have not opened this yet it
smells like berries and it looks to be
not super opaque but that may not be a
bad thing and we'll see whether it dries
down but I love the shade the shades
beautiful and it for a second I was
worried it wasn't gonna close all the
way but it does the shades gorgeous I'm
really excited about trying this so very
happy and then here this is the trio
eyeshadow palette Three's Company by idy
beauty or IB Beauty I don't know if you
say it I would say Eddy because there's
no you know punctuation in between to
show that it's supposed to be said
individually I have not even swatched
this yet let me swatch bit does swoosh
oh they look pretty we've got a nice
little crease color a nice little
highlight color a nice little lid color
someone that knows what they're doing
design this this could be a great look
all on its own because you got a nice
transition at least from my skin tone a
nice metallic lid color and then a
blending color so brow bone highlight
inner corner highlight things like that
but I don't know how much this is going
to work as a complete palette for
someone with a deeper skin tone so
we'll see I'm touching the lip product
and it's definitely after being on for a
minute or so it's definitely
transferring so we're gonna have to play
with that and see whether I like that or
not I am now a complete mess so I will
be able to tell you whether this box is
worth $21 next month definitely make
sure you hit the subscribe button if you
would like to see that also you can hit
