the August boxy charm and my unboxing
ish thing of the September boxy charm I
do my subscription boxes a little bit
differently I try to make them a little
more helpful in that I try all of the
products in the previous month so that
you can get full reviews on those
products and then I introduce you to the
products that I got in the current month
so you know what's going to be reviewed
for the following month a little bit
different personally I like it better
because i feel like it's quite helpful
this box is sent to me for review by
boxy charm but that in no way influences
my review boxy charm knows i'm going to
be honest in the review and they love me
for it boxy charm is 21 dollars a month
comes to your house every month and
always comes with a ridiculous amount of
stuff in it for $21 so let's show you at
this point what i got in my august boxy
charm and i'm going to tell you
everything that I thought about each of
the products i'm wearing quite a few of
them on my face today so in this box we
got five products we're going to go
ahead and start with the only product
that i did not try and that was the dls
matte lipstick i just could not bring
myself too seriously where the shade
this is a shade it's an orange based red
and it's just not a shade I enjoy
wearing and I could not force myself to
wear it so I feel really bad but I
cannot review this I'm not going to lie
to you and tell you I wore it when I
absolutely did not wear it so this is
actually going to be passed on I'd
rather be passed on to a good home than
have me have it sit around i did swatch
it but the person i'm passing on to
doesn't care that it's watched but i'm
not going to use it because i want to
give it a good home moving on to all the
rest of the things which are things that
i did try we'll talk about the blush and
bronzer mini palette by Coastal Scents I
am a big Coastal Scents fan on I like
the blushes better than the bronzers I
didn't feel like the bronzers had enough
pigmentation I think it's nice when a
bronzer can build it nicely but these
honestly did not build up to a point
where I could see them on my skin tone I
don't think that they would build up to
anyone deeper than me maybe someone
lighter than me would be able to see
something from this now this here it
looks like it's got some shimmer
in the background but I found this to be
quite a matte highlight I ended up
putting it under my under eyes today and
you can see my under eyes are not
sparkly I did actually enjoy it for that
purpose for like an under eye
brightening for my personal skin tone I
can see someone with a deeper skin tone
using this sheet as a matte highlight to
highlight under the brow bone down the
nose things like that it's actually a
quite a nice highlight the blushes I
liked a bit they are buildable they're
not they don't take you straight to
clown face I feel like the lighter pink
is definitely easier for me to work with
then the darker pink I think the dark
pink is a little bit harder in that it
shows up with more pigmentation on my
particular skin tone but I would imagine
this would be a lot easier to work with
on someone with a medium to deeper skin
tone overall this Pelt was just okay for
me I feel like these are the only shades
that I'm personally going to use these I
probably will not use and then moving
onto the skin care product this is the
aloe pure time repair serum and it's by
Alouette and I actually really really
like this a lot I don't feel like I've
used it enough to see some really good
results but I think it might be doing
something nice I feel like skin care
takes longer than a month to truly give
it a nice review but so far I'm really
loving this a lot i'm looking forward to
trying some more things from this brand
I like that it's a nice glass bottle it
gives me like that fancy shmancy feeling
it seeps into the skin very nicely it
does have a scent to it it's kind of a
light floral scent but if you don't like
scented face products you will not like
this but I love the way it feels on my
skin and I feel like it might actually
be doing some time repair possibly the
eyeshadow crayon by beauty for real this
is a shadow stick it's in the shade
midnight marathon which i think is kind
of a strange name for something so
bronzy I don't know but I do really like
this eyeshadow crayon I use it a couple
of times i am using it today it's got
kind of a shimmery base to it it's very
very pretty kind of like a taupe i used
it all over my lids and one thing i
really like about this is it plays well
with powder eyeshadow sometimes with
cream shadow products you can't get
powder eye shadows to blend with them
and i don't i don't know i don't like
using a whole lot of cream products on
my eyes so it's really nice to be able
to use this along with powder products
as well lasting power was very good did
crease on my legs kept my my powder
shadows on longer and I just really
really like this product I've tried a
couple of things from this brand it's
been hit or miss for me but this is
definitely a win for me the last product
and in the August boxy charm was the amp
lamaze Cara amplifying mascara serum
this is made by the same people that
make the makeup eraser i love my makeup
eraser especially the pink one I find
the blue one stained really really
quickly but I love my pink one it is i
don't know if it's giving me like a like
a serum effect meaning that it's
lengthening my lashes because i honestly
I have to tell you I've been using a
bunch of different mascaras so I haven't
used this for the serum effects but i
have been using it as a regular mascara
I don't find that it flakes I don't have
a problem with mascara smudging on me
but I don't find flakiness in this one I
do think that this is a very buildable
mascara and it needs building I have
very short sparse lashes and this takes
a good three to four coats for it to
look like it's doing anything so I feel
like it's a lot of work for what it is
and I don't particularly I don't think
this would be something I would
repurchase but I mean it's not a bad
mascara especially if you already have
some length and volume you'll probably
really like this but for me personally I
just mmm it just it wasn't it took too
much work for it to work on my
particular lashes so overall do I feel
like this box e-tron was worth $21
definitely and I think what really
pushes it over the edge are these two
products right here I know that the
serum has got to be really expensive I
can't find my card but you know because
I've put it in the in it annotations but
I know this has to be worth more than
twenty dollars and I think that it's
definitely worth more than twenty
dollars at least from what I'm seeing so
far I also really like the beauty for
real I crayon I think even with just
these two products it's worth well over
twenty dollars to me I feel like this
adds a little bit of niceness to it
especially if you don't have a lot of
blushes and bronzers you may like this
personally I could kind of do without it
I don't know I do really like the
highlight and the blushes but I don't
know this one was a definite no for me
just because of the shade and then this
here the mascara I could definitely do
without just because it was too much
work but again I I really do think that
it was worth $21
month and I'm very happy with my boxy
charm so let's go ahead and jump into
what I got in the September box that i
will be reviewing next month so this I
haven't really played with I was just in
on New York for generation beauty and I
just got home so I haven't actually used
anything in this box yet I did open it
but I haven't used anything so the first
thing I was really happy to see was this
project beauty hair a girt strawberry
banana smoothie yogurt hair mask I have
been trying to dye my ends and I've dyed
them a bunch of times and they're
starting to get fried so I really need
hair mask that work this stuff smells
amazing it smells like strawberry banana
yogurt which to me is amazing like I was
so excited about this so it just says
helps tame unruly frizzy dry hair and
this is what I need in my life and it
smells amazing so I can't wait to use
this the next thing in here is the
studio makeup on the go eyeshadow
palette and just from initial swatches
of this I think it's going to be great
I'm excited to use it more the shades
are beautiful they're very appropriate
for a fall I think that they're going to
work for a lot of skin tones you've got
a nice mix of light mediums and deeps
and I think that it's the perfect
combination of those you also have a
nice mix of matt and shimmers you've got
one two three four shimmers and one two
three four five Matt's they really put
this together nicely as far as the shade
range and I'm so excited to use this I
this oh I'm so excited the next thing is
this pure lip by pure minerals it's a
hydrating lip lacquer and it is I did
roll it up and swatch it it is this deep
berry shade it seems very very thick
very shiny very opaque and I cannot wait
to use this more I want to see how this
where's I'm curious about that next up a
butter london nail polish i remember i
got a boxy charm that had an arse nail
polish in it and I about flipped my lid
I was pretty excited to see this butter
london nail polish as well butter london
has been kind of a hit or miss for me
some of the shades i find to be sheer
i'm really curious to play with this
actually i might put it on right now
I've drunk
foaming this video might put on because
mom they all need to be done so yeah so
I'm excited about the the butter london
nail polish you're trying that out and
then the last thing in here is a hike re
eyeliner in Raven to be completely
honest with you I don't know if I'm
going to use this just because I've
tried akari eyeliners before I have a
million black eyeliners and I would hate
for this to go to waste this will
probably end up going in my giveaway box
for an extra for when I send out give
away prizes a lot of times I'll throw in
extras this might be something I throw
in with that because I would hate to
waste an entire eyeliner when I've
already tried the hikari eyeliners and I
kind of have an opinion about them in
general but I'll make sure that I
mentioned that in the full review that I
probably will not try this but I'm super
excited about these four products like
really really excited so I cannot wait
to try those and review those for you
