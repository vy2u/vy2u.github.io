well kind of a product review but a
company review for you of the products
that I got from them and the name of the
company is everyday minerals I got and
every day remember the bit and say that
five times fast every day minerals and
four day minerals
I got in every day minerals brush this
one right here in my beauty box five and
I was so so happy with this brush that I
decided to check out their website and
when I did I saw they had a lots and
lots of cool stuff so because I'm just
starting to get into mineral makeup I
wanted to try out some of their parts
and see what I thought so oh and also I
needed an angled brush I wanted this for
bronzing so I got this one here now I
own these two everyday minerals brushes
and I love these they are very very
dense which is perfect I feel like if a
brush is too fluffy I can't get product
on and it's very annoying a nice fluffy
brush is nice for powder for me but for
blush and bronzer I really like to use a
dense brush so these work perfectly love
them I also got the brunette kit um the
kits come with lots of stuff and I think
it was like twenty five dollars
something ridiculously cheap and I'll
show you what I got
and I'll put swatches so you can see
what's going on there
you got to pick what base you wanted
this it's a jojoba base whatever that is
I don't know what that is but jojoba and
I got mine and nude I do like it it is
not super high coverage so if you need a
high coverage foundation I would not
recommend the jojoba one I'll tell you
about later I did get some other samples
but I haven't tried those enough to
really give you a good assessment of
what's going on with those next we got a
bronzer and this one is called the
fitness bronzer this actually didn't
make me super happy it is very dark I
was very disappointed in that and I'll
show you the swatch but this is way too
dark for me it went on super
mented it was very difficult to blend I
did not enjoy this for me next up we
have the concealer and the concealer
they gave me is in medium and this
actually did work for me even though I'm
pretty light skinned it did work for me
but again not super full coverage you're
gonna get a very light coverage with
this so it's nice for very light
under-eye circles but definitely not my
favorite concealer or where I start
liking things a little more is with the
blush and this one is in snuggle isn't
that cute
now this one is quite light if you're a
darker skinned person this will not work
for you it'll probably come out kind of
ashy because it is so light but if
you're very light skinned and this is my
is just it's very very pretty it's got a
little bit of a shimmer to it which I
enjoy as long as it's just a little bit
of shimmer and it is just a little bit
now I'll show you the things that I
liked the most which were the eye
shadows the eye shadows were absolutely
stinking gorgeous oh my goodness I
pulled these eyeshadows out and I was
like oh my gosh I'm in love with these
they gave us one it says pearl eyes so
I'm assuming it's for eyes but it's it's
called illuminator X and I have been
using this as a highlight and it is just
so gorgeous I mean just beautiful and it
does have that pearlescent Sheen to it
and it's just I'm in love with it love
it
the other ones are really interesting
too
they gave me one this one's called
elevate this one is like a gray-green it
has some green shimmer in it and it is
beautiful for outer quarter blend it up
into the crease just gorgeous and you
can see over here all the sparkle that's
in it just beautiful there's some silver
sparkle in there too which is really
nice love it the last one they gave us
is in it's called in the garden and this
one was my absolute favorite it is a
dark brown glittery eye shadow it has
some of the most gorgeous glitter I have
ever seen in an eyeshadow
unfortunately the glitter seems to fall
away as
day goes on even when I'm used a primer
or like my color tattoos it just doesn't
the glitter doesn't seem to say the
color stays really well the color stays
all day long just gorgeous
but the glitter seems to fall away and
go away as the day goes on which made me
a little bit sad the last thing I got in
this kit I remember this whole kit was
like 25 bucks I mean just really very
inexpensive was this lip lipstick and I
love this color lipstick absolutely love
it the packaging is quite cheap looking
and that I don't enjoy it's just
straight just plastic just white plastic
which is kind of strange and it is just
a beautiful color it's kind of this
movie yeah it's movie but it's not
overpowering and that's what I really
like about it I don't like lipsticks
that are super pigmented and make me
look like I've just painted my lips with
a paint brush
I don't enjoy that and this really gives
my lips a nice color without it looking
like I've just been painted my only
complaints about this are the packaging
just really cheap but that's secondary
the product was most important and the
smell smell typical lipstick smell it
doesn't have a generally nice smell and
when it's right under my nose I like my
lipsticks to snow pretty nice so those
are my complaints about this but a nice
good good good product here I do enjoy
it the other thing I wanted to let you
guys know about is if you're interested
in trying products from everyday
minerals they give out samples of their
products for one penny you pay one cent
plus shipping and you get seven samples
of their products so they come in these
little packs these little foil wrappers
and you rip them off and it gives you a
really nice size though I was surprised
and how big of a sample they were
definitely enough to use a few times to
really get an idea of whether you'll
like their products or not so I got this
blush in nature sweet side and I'm
really enjoying that down when I I like
this one even better than the one that I
got in the full-size I got this
finishing powder which I haven't tried
yet
I got everyday bronzer which I like
better than the bronzer that I caught
it's a little bit lighter a little more
wearable also another blush that I got
is called Girl Friday and I am enjoying
this one as well I got some faces and I
haven't tried all the bases yet
it is kind of a pain to get these out of
these packets and I just don't feel like
it in the morning getting them out of
the packets I'm sure I will try them
eventually and if they're amazing I will
totally let you know but I got I'll live
fair I got and that's a mat base I got
multi-tasking neutral it's a mat base
and I got light neutral which is a mat
base and I'm really looking forward to
trying those but I just haven't gotten
to it yet so those are the seven sample
packs that I got and if you're
interested in getting these I will put a
link to everyday minerals down below I'm
also going to put my beauty box five
code that I got down below I'm not sure
if it still works but if you try it
right away it might still work I don't
know it's worth trying though I think it
was 20% off of anything on the site I
did send an email to everyday minerals
to ask them if they would give me a
discount code for you guys and they said
that they're not doing that at this time
not holding it against them they have an
absolute right to tell me no totally
fine with me but I will put my beauty
box live code down there if you want to
use that one I don't know if I'm allowed
to but you know try to hook y'all up
here overall assessment everyday
minerals really loving the eye shadow
products really like the lip products
blushes are kind of a hit-or-miss
bronzers hit or miss the concealer and
the foundation very light coverage and I
