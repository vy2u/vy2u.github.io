the brand J cat beauty now J cat beauty
is an indie brand that has been in a lot
of subscription boxes I've seen him an
Ipsy escena min boxycharm I've seen that
if I see an unboxing baby of ARCA Trump
I know seen them in beauty box 5 it's a
brand I didn't have a lot of experience
with until I tried their wonder lip
paints and I was like yes these things
are awesome so when Jacob Beauty
contacted me and said they wanted to
send me some promotional products to see
what I thought and then I was in chat I
guess it was maybe a few maybe a month
or so ago and somebody said hey have you
tried anything by Jake at beauty and I
was like oh I happen to have an email my
inbox right now from them they want to
send me stuff they were like yeah she
should totally do it and I don't think
it was somebody from the company I don't
think I'm pretty sure it was somebody
that I named that I recognized from my
channel so now kind of push it over the
edge and I decided to do this review I'm
not being paid any additional money by
Jake at beauty they just sent me the
products for promotion so they did send
me a ginormous bag of products it didn't
look like this when they sent it to me
it was just more functional for me to
keep it in a bag what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna go over everything they
sent me and what I think of it I'm also
going to show you some of the Wonder lip
paints that I got from Ipsy bags as well
since I happen to have them so let's go
ahead and just start with the lip paints
because those are my favorite products
from them and I do have five of those
here make sure I have five no I got more
than five missing there's six five more
than six what's going on here Oh a seven
five seven do you want a lip swatch and
I do lip swatches yeah I should do lip
swatches okay let's do some lip swatches
here we go alright good thing I got a
natural lipstick on this is a color pop
lipstick which is a review that's coming
up very soon it's in the shade button I
believe so we're going to go light to
dark for the sake of my lips the first
one here is called orange delight okay
and this is the way that I apply it you
can also apply it with a lip brush
and that's what I do I just kind of mush
it around so that is orange delight and
this is the way that it looks in the
packaging so you can see it's very very
similar and I'm one that I would never
never use an orange lip product but this
is subtle enough that I feel like I can
wear it it's wearable for me it doesn't
make me look dead lip but it's neutral
so I do really like the shade a lot next
up is this one here and this is called
blabber walkie and this was one that I
got a lot of compliments on I think I
warden a what's up in makeup or maybe my
spring favorites and it's this is the
one this is the one I was wearing and
everybody's like oh my gosh what's on
your lips it was it alright so there is
belieber walkie and I didn't mention
these are all names after Alice in
Wonderland which I absolutely love I
actually have an Alice in Wonderland
tattoo on my back which one day I may
show you but yeah this is this is lever
walkie and this is probably my favorite
of all of them okay next up is one that
I actually haven't ever tried because
the color scares me to death this one is
called the DOE know about this one it's
just you know I'm just not a bright lip
kind of chick here another thing that I
haven't told you yet about these is they
wear off very very evenly they're not
one they kind of dry you know goes off
patchy and you can see it goes on very
smoothly it does have kind of an oil
base to it it's like a liquid lipstick
but it's just in that tube formats I
mean really and truly it could just as
easily be in a tube with a doe foot
applicator
as far as the way that it feels so this
one is the dodo and I feel like quite a
dodo with this bright color on my left
Wow but that's what it looks like maybe
this is your color eye it's a little too
loud for me but maybe it's your color
I'm gonna look like a Ronald McDonald by
the time I'm done with it oh you can see
it's kind of staining my lips which is
great but not as great for swatching
alright the next one is also a bright
one this one is called talking flowers
and it is a lavender shade and I've
never won a lip color this shade before
and I'm a little scared but you're with
me you'll hold my hand right oh my god
I know they say the shade is so trendy
but oh no I guess I'm not trendy like
that
oh no girlfriend I don't know but can
you imagine the shade on someone with a
deep skin tone I mean this would look
gorgeous gorgeous on the right person
it's just not my personality but just so
you know what it looks like it is called
this is again this is called talking
flowers and it's purple they also have
the crazy colors like the blues and the
greens and the yellows and all that if
you're interested in those colors it's
like seeping down onto my face okay so
which one is darker alright let's go
with this one next this one is called
mad splatter right on the teeth that was
my fault I don't blame the product
that's operator error I'm so not classy
in this application I know it I know it
but I've got to be me and I'm not that
classy this stuff is so pigmented it's
crazy and there is mad splatter I
haven't noticed any transferring on my
teeth either like if I purposely go of
course I'm gonna get an idea 19 but if I
don't purposely do that I haven't had
any problems with transfer all right
I've totally destroyed a wipe I'm gonna
get another one all right - laughs the
next one is called
golden afternoon which I don't quite get
I guess maybe if the Sun is going down
or something you'd end up with this red
shade I don't know but oh my god I so
look what I just did oh my god I'm a
mess I'm a mess this is like the perfect
vampire costume red definitely going to
be more of a fall color for me and
something that I probably won't wear
super often but it's a sexy red I really
like it a lot and again this one's
called golden afternoon I look like a
clown that's been beat in the face so I
got one more I just use a little bit of
foundation to kind of mute out some of
the craziness going on this last one is
called Queen of Hearts and it's this
deep oh gosh okay here we go this was
actually kind of sheer compared to the
other ones I'm surprised the other ones
are super super opaque this one actually
seems not quite as crazy this one did
build up a little bit so you can do this
one definitely as a wash of color or you
can make it more opaque this is kind of
as opaque as it gets so just be aware of
that if
you choose this I was going to do
swatches of some of the other lip colors
but my lips I don't think can take it so
I'm just going to kind of show you the
rest in swatch warm but the the lip
paints are kind of my favorite formulas
the other ones are really good too
they're just different so the lip paints
are more of like your liquid lipstick
and then for other lip products they've
got a bunch of lip crayon e type things
so they've got these big lip pencils
that are very very creamy they're um
they're I would definitely call them
more of a like a balm stain kind of
situation there with that this one is
called dolly ping and this one is called
caramel mocha and there's that that's
caramel mocha so the top is dolly pink
the second one is caramel mocha and they
all come in this red packaging no matter
what the shade is this one is called
Christmas and I'm going to put that one
below the mocha one so down the third
one is Christmas and then this one here
is called satin so that one on the
bottom is satin and you can see that one
definitely has a satin finish to it
where the other ones are more glossy
this one here is called hot pink okay
and there's hot pink there for you
that's the bottom one and that is it for
those lip colors these have pretty
typical wear time I'm just going to go
ahead and apply my favorite one which is
Christmas I'm going to apply that one
and just kind of leave that one on
instead of having this dead lip look
that I've got going on right now it's
just kind of your typical nudey pink but
I really like it it feels very
moisturizing and again typical wear time
wears down very nicely not patchy just a
nice product Oh smell I didn't tell you
smell smell is mildly vanilla but it's
not very strong I can't smell it on my
lips right now the only time I can smell
it is if I hold it up to my nose but
it's got a nice scent when you hold it
up to your nose the lip paints have a
slight minty kind of set to them but
again it's not very strong not
overpowering these are called twisting
kiss hydrating lip balms this one is in
vampire kiss
I would expect for vampire kiss to be
more of a red shade but it's definitely
a pinky shade this one is called jawline
kiss and again typical pink a new
beautifulness so the next one that from
the twist and kiss line is called wet
kiss all right here we go let's true it
go all right so it's like a bright
bright bright pink so really and truly I
didn't see a big difference between the
formula of these and these I think it's
just you know the pencil form versus you
know this plastic around the outside
form but I mean they were they wore
really nicely I felt like the opacity
was pretty much the same the Sun of
these are the same just that very mild
vanilla scent but again extremely
extremely mild okay so these are all of
the lip liners that they sent I'll show
you this side two sides a little bit
more of a tell of what they look like
this one is called the skinny and long
lip pencil we'll talk about those first
these are really long like a magetta
this is an urban decay eye liner and you
can see the height difference in between
these I mean just huge difference and
we'll take the cap off just to show you
the difference of product that you're
going to be getting I mean just a huge
difference there so this one is called
puce actually when you wipe off my hand
first my skin hates me right now hates
me
so this first one is called puce okay
this next one is called tea rose I don't
really see much of a shade difference in
there maybe when i zoom in we'll be able
to see a little bit better but tea rose
pretty much looks like pews to me this
one here is called chocolate and believe
it or not this is for lips I guess this
would be probably for darker skin tones
but it really looks like a nice brow
pencil to me as far as the color but
it's got the creaminess of a lip pencil
and then this one is a red one called
electric crimson and then the final one
from this formula is called amaranth
pink and it's just a bubblegum II kind
of pink there is a creaminess to them
they're not drying at all they feel good
on the lips for a lip pencil I'm not a
huge lip pencil fan just because it's
kind of high me
but I'm telling you these things last
forever on the lips oh there's one more
there's one more that I missed this one
is called black and it's black but it
says that it's for lips so we're gonna
go with that I had someone in chat tell
me they wanted me to do a goth look so
this would be for my god look okay so
those are the regular pencils now these
here the hashtag MOTD ones are the
waterproof versions as far as wear time
I did notice that these lasted just a
little bit longer but not that much
longer than the other pencils overall
they're both very very long wearing so
whatever you know if you want one that's
a little bit long longer wearing go for
the hashtag MOTD if you just want just a
regular you know whenever lip pencil go
for the other ones but I honestly didn't
see too much of a difference I did
notice though that these tips sometimes
broke when I started using them so make
sure you have a sharpener handy when you
get these where none of these broke on
me so like throwing it so keep that in
mind if you decide to order any of these
so I'm just going to go ahead and pair
these up next to the non waterproof
versions so here is the black you can
see they're very similar here is TIROS
which is right here and you can see it's
pretty much the same
this is Cabernet which is actually not
one of the other ones that they sent in
the not waterproof I'm just going to set
that one right here Cabernet this one
here is called warm brown we'll put that
next to this brown one up here this
one's call is the amaranth pink so of
course oh here we go put that right here
so it's definitely brighter in the
waterproof version and then this one
here is the last one they set me in this
formula and this one is called purple
but right there and I do feel like now
swatching all of them and really feeling
them all at the same time I feel like
the waterproof ones are just slightly
crania alright now that we have done all
of the lip products they send me let's
move on to the eye products where since
we're going with pencils let's keep
going with pencils and I'm going to show
you the eyeliner products that they set
these are also the hashtag MOTD so they
are waterproof I did use them in my
waterline on my lower lash line they did
last all
they on my lashline but they only lasted
about five out four or five hours in my
waterline which is pretty good my hand
is like hating me right now so let's go
ahead and let's watch these this one is
in pure white and one thing I've been
doing with this that I really really
love is doing like an ombre look where I
do like a darker color than a mid-tone
color and then the white on the inside
and it looks really really really pretty
my husband looked at me other day he's
like what did you do and I told him what
I did I told him was with these pencils
and he was like yes do that again this
is another one that I've been doing that
with this one is called a Roman gold and
oh now it broke okay I got a sharpener
so I'll show you how to see this is what
happens sometimes with the with them as
they break off makes me not happy but
you know that's what sharpeners are for
and then Jake at also sells a sharpener
I'm not sure how much this cost but I'm
pretty sure it's a pretty reasonably
priced but they do sell sharpener so I'm
just going to go ahead and sharpen this
baby up all right so let me swatch that
see how it's so so great gold I mean
it's just gorgeous gorgeous and that
lasts like no joke that will last
okay the silver one is also really fun
for that inner corner like ombre kind of
look and there's that okay this is more
of like a mid-tone this one is called
tropical green there you go and this one
is a matte shade which is kind of
interesting because it's got this
shimmery outside so you wouldn't expect
it to be matte but it is matte where all
these the white is matte the green is
matte the gold and the silver are
shimmery they're metallic this one is
the blue this one is called sunrise blue
and this one is also a matte it's kind
of a dusty blue and this one is a brown
it is called light brown and again a
matte and then finally this one is
called dark brown
there you go so along with those they
did send me some of these pigments now
this is probably one of my least
favorite products that I got from them
not because of the quality but because
of the packaging I'm not a fan of this
packaging at all it's very very messy
the other thing is it comes with the
sticker on here the sticker has the
color the shade on it and I really
really like to have the shade on it so I
was finding myself on peeling the
sticker sticking it on my desk using the
product and then sticking the sticker
back on so that I could keep the color
so and it does kind of the sticker seals
in the top so that you can't open it
unless you take the seal off so I wish
they would change that or put a sticker
on the bottom I would really really like
that a lot open is the one that I like
the most which is called salmon this is
a gorgeous all-over lid color but
girlfriend you already know what I'm
going to say it's messy it's very very
messy so you open this up and it's just
got kind of a top like that it's just a
little bottle and then what I do is I
just go like this and I shake it down on
my finger and then you can see that
there and then I just Pat it on my lid
like that and I'm going to leave it like
that I'm not going to apply it with a
brush because that is the way I've been
applying it to my lid and it's just
absolutely stinking gorgeous it lasts
all day long I mean and just the most
beautiful beautiful shimmer I mean just
absolutely beautiful like really
actually I really love the shade it's
just it's messy this one is called dark
wood but you can see that shine there I
mean just absolutely gorgeous and they
split they blend really nicely into each
other you can tap them on like what I'll
do is I'll tap it onto my outer corner
and then I'll blend it up into my crease
it works perfectly that way it's just a
little more high maintenance okay and
this one I really liked a lot - this
one's called mocha coffee Oh
see I just spilled it just spilled it
everywhere all over my jeans it just so
put that right here this is mocha coffee
and this one's more of like a topi light
brown
it's really beautiful look I've take
some off my jeans and put it over here
so you can really see well and see how
much oh gosh now I really made a mess of
it goodness gracious yeah messy messy
beautiful and messy if you like
beautiful messes
this shadow is perfect all right I got
to clean this up I'll be right back okay
so what I've done is I went and I wiped
off as much as I could off of my jeans
and I Reese watch them so this is the
mocha coffee this is the dark wood and
then this is the salmon now I'm going to
go into the other colors this one is
absolutely gorgeous if you love gold
this one is called earth mango let me
show you what that looks like just oh so
pretty so pretty I just wish that they
put them in different packaging and I
think that they would just be perfect
even if they put them in the little the
little cups instead I mean because like
look can you see that that's the way it
comes
I haven't swatch this one yes all right
so now we're going to swatch that one
now that we're in safety zone here there
you go just gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous this one here is called live
black or live black I'm not sure what
the intention is and really it's a deep
grey not really a black it's a deep grey
so just be aware of that now these last
two are really fun for the right person
I tried to put these on as an inner
corner highlight before work and I was
like oh no what did I do
no but if you're going out to the club
or if you got you know really cool like
vibrant Halloween kind of look or
whatever where you're looking for
something that's got some iridescent
glitter in these things are gorgeous
this one the warmness watch first is
called Bondi black and then this one is
called lion silver I'm going to swatch
those for you now okay when I use this
on my eye I swear it was more opaque
than not showing up here I don't know
why but the Bondi black is kind of this
here and then the silver is here I don't
know what's happening there but I
remember being pretty opaque when I put
it on my skin like it was oh it was it
was solid glitter so I don't know maybe
it was because of the primer I was using
maybe because of my foundation or
whatever but they're not applying to my
hand as beautifully as they did to the
eye but their glitters man they are
hardcore crazy glitters moving from eye
products on to cheek products now
actually these along with the Wonder lip
paints are my favorite things that I got
now they do have a little bit of a
drawback in that they come
if an overspray of glitter so you can
see better on this one this one is in
lovestruck you can see there was a cap
there and you can still see a little bit
of the overspray here and here on the
top and bottom but it was a very thick
overspray that definitely wears down so
I just kind of wiped it off a bit I
didn't notice it impacting my cheek
color but it's just for pretty it's not
really part of the functional product so
this here I really really love these
blushes they are very long wearing they
are beautiful there's the finger swatch
we'll do a hand swatch see the bright
pigmentation is craziness but it doesn't
show like the show up like that on the
cheek I'll show you in a second let me
do the swatch here the finger swatch of
this one this one you can tell the cat's
like gone because I've been wearing this
like every day this one is called sweet
pea pink and of course with somebody
with a deeper skin tone this may not
show up on you I'm a light medium skin
tone shows up beautifully on me but it's
very very natural some of the lighter
skin tone this would work well I don't
think anybody that's that much darker
than you probably get much out of this
one but I've really really been enjoying
it it's just very very very natural and
beautiful on me this is the it cosmetics
blush brush one of them play cosmetics
blush brushes and Lindy brush swatches
not a whole lot of powder kicking up
here but definitely some powder if
you're not gentle this is one you don't
need to press hard oh this is called I'm
not lovestruck this is called baby boo
I've been calling it lovestruck its baby
boo okay so this will definitely be more
for someone with a deeper skin tone but
you can definitely lighten this up you
can blend it out if you really love the
shading your lighter you can you can
really work with this and make it not be
clown face let me wipe that off there I
probably should use the lighter one
first because now my brush is going
crazy okay let's see if I can get a good
true color off of this one yeah it's
doing good okay and you can barely even
see it there but I swear it's really
pretty on the cheeks let me see if I can
get a little bit more there you go
I don't know if you can see that but it
really is beautiful on the cheeks so
definitely highly recommend these these
are fantastic fantastic blushes another
thing I love that about jcat beauty is
that it's very very affordable
compared to a lot of higher-end makeup
brands you know it's kind of like color
pop you know as far as the the price
range on everything so I really like I I
really really like the makeup products
and I'm being genuine on that the only
the one that I like the least is the
pigments and it's not because of the
quality it's just because of the
packaging now the last thing they sent
me was a few brushes and I do want to
show those to you and I have been using
them and really enjoying them this one
is called the pro makeup flat tub angled
kabuki and I've used this for foundation
and really really liked it for
foundation I've also used it for bronzer
I really like it for that as well
there's some stray hairs here but I'm
not getting any fallout for the I'm not
getting any enough fallout but I'm not
getting any loose bristles coming out I
have not washed these yet but you can
see the density here that's very very
dense you don't see kind of some powder
flying off of there but they're very
very dense they work very nicely this
one is a very bit just keep in mind this
one is going to be more for something
that you need a dense brush for it's not
for something for a light application I
have a did user for powder it wasn't a
big fan of it for powder just because it
moved my foundation around too much it's
too dense for powder but I really liked
it like it for foundation this one here
I've also used a bit for foundation this
is the pro makeup conic kabuki and it's
really nice for getting under the under
eyes also I've used it a bit for
contouring and I've really enjoyed it
for that as well and this one feels a
little bit more since than synthetic
than the other one but they're all very
very very soft
then there's two more this one is an
eyeliner brush this one's fantastic I
mean it's just what you would expect
from an eyeliner brush you also use this
also for eyebrows and it's very very
thin for eyebrows so if you really need
a detailed brow brush this is perfect of
course it's got the spoolie on the end
so that you can use it for your brows
this one is also can be used for liner
it can be used for brows and then this
one here is a fantastic crease brush
I've been using this to kind of detail
my crease smoked out the outer corner
things like that it's a very interesting
shape there it's kind of almost like a
pencil shape but it's been it and really
really enjoying this I don't own any
brushes like this so I'm really enjoying
that this one for this kind of flat
brush it's very very thin so it's good
for adding detail it's also good for
cutting the crease and then the last
brush is called the pro
medium shader and this is a flat
eyeshadow brush I'm not a big fan of
this brush just because the taper
doesn't go down very far and I'm just
not a fan of flat eyeshadow brushes in
general I can see that this would be
nice for the right person but just keep
in mind that you're only going to be
picking up product on just this part and
up so it's going to be better for
detailing than it will be for packing on
color so that is it for my jcat Beauty
review of the brand overall I absolutely
love what I got and I think especially
for the price I feel like it's a brand
you should definitely check out quality
seems to be great again the only thing I
would be warmed about is the overspray
on the blushes if you can get past that
they're amazing
the pencils you can break so make sure
you have a sharpener and the pigments
are messy so make sure when you
initially open them that you have some
place to catch any overfill that may
spill out so those are my only three
critiques everything else amazing
especially recommending the wonder lip
paints and the blushes as being my
favorite products that where I was sent
so those would be my number one
recommendation is number one and number
two tied for number one recommendation
