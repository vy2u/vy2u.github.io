video okay so i decided that i wanted to
make a video for people that either have
been in to make up for a while but
haven't really gone into the whole
high-end thing because it's a little
scary spending fifty dollars on one
thing for makeup a little scary I wanted
to make something to kind of show you
some of the things that are worth the
money and some things that are not worth
the money at least in my opinion now of
course I don't know if you know this but
I'm a teacher I don't have a ridiculous
amount of money spent on makeup so I
haven't bought all the different brands
out there so you may have some high-end
brands and products that you love that
you would have put in this video but I
may not know about those so if you have
high end products that you like type
them in the comments so that maybe I
could try them and then I can do another
video about great high-end products that
you recommend it to me that I bought and
light so anyway so here we go so I
wanted to show you first of all some
things that I love that I spend a lot of
money on and I'm so glad that I love
them because they were quite expensive
and i'll be putting the money value
somewhere over here appear somewhere
i'll be putting how much it costs for
the item so that you know okay so the
first thing that i wanted to show you
was my bobby brown long-wear gel
eyeliner in black ink now let me show
you how much I've loved this one this
one's like it's like all dug up because
i have used this so much i've had it for
about a year and i still have a lot left
I use it all the time so if you don't
like a liquid eyeliner this is kind of a
step up from pencil as far as the
sharpness of the line the other thing is
this blends a little bit where a liquid
eyeliner does not blend so if you get
too crisp of a line you can blend it a
little bit and you apply it with a
eyeliner brush now this one is made by
Sephora and it's number 15 but you do
not need sephora brush I believe elf
makes a brush that's exactly like this
and I think it's a dollar so if I note
about that when I probably would have
bought this I wouldn't have bought this
one so this goes on the list of things
that you don't need to buy that or a
little high end I don't know how much
paid for I'll put it there ok so that's
the bobbi brown long-wear gel eyeliner
and it lasts for ever like you'll put it
on the morning and the end of the day it
will look exactly the same awesome stuff
so pick your favorite color and buy it
on that note I got the blue one the
cobalt inc one I don't recommend buying
the blue the cobalt ink because when you
put it on you can't really tell that
it's blue it's so dark it almost looks
like the black one so don't buy the
cobalt blue by the black or by a
different color the next thing i want to
show you is something i mentioned in my
last video which is my sephora cream
blush this stuff is amazing it stays on
all day long ok so let me swatch this
for you so look how pretty ok and then
BAM and then you just kind of blend it
out and it's so pretty you have it all I
don't know if you can see it but I have
that one so highly recommend this just
because of the staying power of it what
I think I want to talk about this you
know what I do with this I use it as a
lipstick and then I but it comes out
very mad if you use a little lipstick so
I put gloss over it and it's beautiful
it's absolutely beautiful but you do
need a gloss because it's super mad it's
kind of creepy how super mad it is until
you put the gloss on it so just
suggestions kind of double double
purpose there for you on the contrast
side I got this because it was
recommended by fellow youtuber I think I
think it was more Lena I think it was
makeup etv I I got the idea of getting
this and I was quite disappointed
because of the lack of stain powder and
it's my start my tart blush and doll
faces and it says a 12-hour blush it is
not a 12-hour blush
I mean it's watch is really nice if you
can see that but it's watch is really
nice and it goes on and it looks really
pretty for a good hour maybe two but
definitely not 12 hours it doesn't stay
on that long so don't waste your money
on this in my opinion again it's a
beautiful color but den stay on I'm a
cream blush girl I think forever i don't
think i'm gonna buy any other blushes
ever except for sephora cream blushes
for like ever because they work I don't
need a degree to get less amount of
shades of cream blush so i'm good with
what I got now I don't have any more
because I only keep one mascara open at
a time Lee said try to and this one I
kept open for three or four months and I
had to throw it away which was my I'll
put a picture here my Urban Decay
curling mascara loved it oh my gosh i
have i don't know if you can see because
i don't have I don't have um look how
short my eyelashes are okay super super
super short okay you're not sparse
they're just short so this the Urban
Decay mascara really worked well in
lengthening my lashes is this is what
I'm wearing right now which is the Laura
Mercier mascara which I mentioned my
last video to this stuff who I had it
upside down um this doesn't lengthen my
lashes at all it separates them it would
be really nice for somebody that already
has long lashes because it separates it
really nicely gives them a little more
volume but doesn't lengthen I put on
this last splash lash blast if I can
think lash blast fusion mascara by
covergirl and I put this someone signed
this on the other side and you seriously
could not tell the difference they did
they look exactly the same a separate my
lashes they made a more full they did
not lengthen them so i have the same
problem with going these but this one is
ridiculously cheaper so if you want uh
if you have long lashes don't get this
get this this is my favorite thing that
I've gotten from Laura Mercier okay look
this right here their lip gloss Oh
gorgeous it's like a shimmer Oh move
until work out to ball but it's a
shimmery I'm calling
and it smells like vanilla hey this is
called pink pink diamonds look like pink
bandido for a second for some reason I
don't know maybe I'm tired it's kind of
like pink diamonds um lip gloss it is
not sticky it stays on for a while it's
a little bit on the thicker side so it
stays on for a little while but the
smell it just smells so good just makes
me want to kiss myself if it's oh it's
called lip gloss a gla siiii with a
little hooky thingy little dashie thing
you over the e love it highly recommend
us all right my next thing i want to
show you is my Too Faced sunny bunny
bronzer okay this is not in my opinion a
good bronzer for contouring I have tried
to contour with this blonde and this
this um bronzer and I feel like it's too
dark but for making me look like I've
been out in the Sun it does a really
nice job I don't know if you can tell
cuz i got this bright light shining on
me cuz i have no natural light because i
can't shoot during day cuz I've children
um but yeah I don't know if you can see
it but it really gives such a nice like
sunkissed prettiness when you put it
like where the Sun would naturally hit
you so would highly recommend to face
sunny bunny bronzer yeah I love it
totally worth it totally totally worth
it if you want to look like you've been
out in the Sun a little bit i know that
it's starting to get toward full so much
sure how much more i'm going to be using
this but i'll be saving it for next
spring in the summer and will definitely
be repurchasing this when i hit pan
which i'm sure i will now my favorite my
favorite makeup and if you have no high
end makeup not a stitch of high end
makeup and you want to buy something
that is going to be worth it you want to
spend some money on makeup you want to
treat yourself to something nice this
okay and i know this is everybody's
favorite but there's a reason why it's
everybody's favorite and there's reason
why it's my favorite and the reason why
it's my favorite is this is what made me
have confidence in doing I shadow this
okay and the reason why is because when
you do your shadows okay I'm just going
to open up i'm going to pick a random
color
let's pick snakebite okay when you when
you do your shadows ok I'm going to
Squatch that okay and you want to blend
okay see how it doesn't go away see how
it kind of fades a little bit off to the
side but it doesn't go away okay that's
what you want in an eye shadow you want
an eyeshadow unlike the video that I
shot about the pixi eyeshadows that I
just put up these shadows go on your eye
they stay on there but they blend with
each other so nicely and easily it makes
you feel like you can blend like a pro
without having to have any experience
with blending I shadows the other thing
i love that this Naked palette which
doesn't come with the original Naked
palette is well maybe it does i don't
know but i don't i'm not sure someone
educate me does the doesn't original
mega palette come with this i don't know
but the brush that comes with this you
don't need to buy an additional brush to
go with this a lot of pallets will come
with crappy stinky little cheapo brushes
that you don't really even want to use
but this one comes with a brush that you
can use for blending and for packing on
your shadows so you don't even need to
worry about buying extra brush so right
there you saved yourself some cash and
not buying an extra brush if you don't
have one but the colors in this I know
you've seen this a million times before
if you watch makeup videos on YouTube
but the colors are so versatile okay
you've got your darker colors you've got
your medium colors and you've got your
light colors you've got Browns you've
got grays you've got shimmers you've got
matts you've got whatever you want to
create a natural-looking I you can wear
to work to school to a wedding to a
night out whatever I mean they're so
incredibly versatile so if you have no I
shadow or if you're venturing into the
eyeshadow and you want spend something
high-end invest
this I promise you it is worth it if you
read reviews on Amazon on makeup alley
on any of those websites they people
will all tell you the same thing this is
worth the investment I highly recommend
this okay I've gone on and on about the
nigga to call it enough okay couple more
things that I bought that were high-end
that I did not enjoy that I would not
recommend buying now these are high end
but they didn't cost a lot because they
were on sale on the Urban Decay website
but they still sell these they still
sell these at regular price in full size
these are the minis twenty-four/seven
glide on shadow pencils okay these was I
like I probably will not repurchase them
because I will probably never run out of
them because i only use them
occasionally like here to give myself a
little bit of color or kind of as a
little bit of a liner a little you know
just to give a tiny bit of color I would
never put these all over my eyes never
in a million years but I put either one
of these all over my eye I would look
ridiculous but they're really nice for
like using is kind of like almost like a
liner all right these are impossible to
work with and I've heard other people
say that before these they're very
pigmented they go on very smooth but
they're impossible to work with they
don't even the more I work with them the
less I like them because they don't even
blend with each other very well they
don't blend with with regular eye
shadows they just stick on your eye in
one color and they're lame do not get
these they're not worth the money I love
Urban Decay I'm a huge urban decay fan
but I would never ever recommend these
to anybody just because they are
impossible to work with in contrast with
this made by herb in the game which is
super easy to work with so if this not
this so another thing I wanted to show
you that i would recommend and would not
recommend this has talked about all the
time as the Urban Decay primer potion
this is the old school style that's now
in a squeeze tube which is much much
much better but this one was on sale on
the website when they were trying to get
rid of these bottles and this
one is in greed it's the shimmer one
what I could not find was my Too Faced
shadow insurance which is pretty much
the exact same thing so if you like the
packaging better for the Too Faced
shadow insurance get that one instead or
the Urban Decay primer potion get that
one there might be other high ends
they're just as good as far as eyeshadow
primer I shadow primer the purpose of it
in case you're not sure is to keep your
eyeshadow from creasing keep it to stay
on all keep it lasting and staying on
all day so I would definitely recommend
investing in one of these either the
shadow insurance or this one or read the
comments below if anybody happens the
comment and see what other people use
for high-end I shadow eyeshadow primer
now I've heard bad things about some of
the drugstore ones too like oh why am i
shaking this is like I'm like a
conductor with my primer potion I'm
gonna put that down so that I stopped
doing that but I've heard bad things
about like the elf one and some other
ones primers I shadow primers from
drugstore I've heard bad things so maybe
there's a good drugstore one I haven't
heard of it okay the one thing that I do
want to advise against getting and I
just got this little tiny one this is
the you see it I don't know if you can
see it this is the primed and poreless
by Too Faced I have used this quite a
few times at this point I do not feel
like it makes my makeup last longer I do
not feel like it makes my skin poreless
the only thing I think that it does that
it advertises it it does it does make my
makeup more matte that's really all it
does but if you get a decent not even
decent but if you get a matte foundation
something that's advertised as a matte
foundation you won't even need this even
if it's a drugstore matte foundation you
won't need this so don't don't invest in
this it's crazy expensive don't get it
it's not worth it mad love
we'll see you next time which I said
last time it would be my August
favorites video but I think this one's
gonna go before my August favorites so
my next when I was losing my August
favorites video mad love and I will see
wat muah they're heavy they're like
super heavy like being someone in the
eye with this thing but that is crazy
stuff is insane Wow look how pretty it
blends of men so pretty but it doesn't
go away like the one whose crap he picks
the eyeshadows that I bought che this
one this one's beautiful this one is
verb Oh gorgeous that is I just want to
paint my face with it I just want to put
them all over look I can put it here's a
highlight you would whoa look at that
look how
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
