the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they are with
your hard-earned money today we are
going to be literally bubbling my face
off today on what the K we're going to
be testing out the Eliza Becca milky
piggy carbonated bubble clay mask and
this looks like a whole heck of a lot of
fun and I cannot wait to try it so let
me tell you a little bit about it I did
buy this on Amazon for 10 dollars and 25
cents from Eliza Becca they put the
price kind of goes up and down so the
price right now is 11 dollars and 76
cents you can also get it on I a.com I
will link those down below it is $12.60
from I herb you can also find this on
the inboxes website but they don't
actually sell it on me box's website
they just kind of direct you to the
amazon link so just so you know it's
there too and me but me me box has a lot
of really good information about it
including what it's good for so the
claims for this or that it's going to
exfoliate that's where we're going to be
bubbling my face off it's going to
exfoliate my skin is going to unclog my
pores it's going to deliver nutrients
into my skin it's going to tighten my
pores it's going to fight against future
clogging it's going to cleanse my skin
you can use this as a makeup remover
hence why I have the beat-up-looking
makeup on my face right now it's
supposed to be skin softening and
smoothing for a youthful glow the tips
on me me boxes websites were very
interesting most interesting were where
it said it's suitable for almost all
skin types especially oily however those
with sensitive skin types should first
test the product on a small area of the
skin and we'll get into a little bit
more that when we get into ingredient
analysis and speaking of that it's
actually time for a gradient analysis so
I kind of went from the top to the
bottom of the ingredients and once it
started getting into the preservatives
for the product I'm assuming we're
beyond that 1% line if you don't know
cosmetics in the United States we only
need to have them listed in order up to
where it's more than one percent of the
entire products you could have point
zero zero zero one percent of the
products
something and you can still include it
in the ingredient list so I kind of
threw out those ingredients I will list
them down below in case you're curious
what they are but there is like a bunch
of leaf extracts and different things
that were like really low down am I
going to talk about those we're going to
talk about the top half of the
ingredient list so the first thing is
the coca middle propyl bedding betaine
bet chain irritation concerns on that
one which is probably the sensitive skin
bit also irritation concerns on dye
propylene glycol then we get into some
things that would be the positive
ingredients that would make this a
really good mask so we have disodium
cocoa and so diacetate a truth and aging
which is a website that I really enjoy
it says it's highly valued for cleansing
the skin or hair without stripping of it
of its natural oils and is us
incorporated into many moisturizing
cosmetic cleaning products so I'll put
the link to that down below green tea is
also in this I talked a lot about green
tea in the last whata k because that was
a major ingredient in the clay mask we
did last week so I will link that video
down below in case you're curious about
that but the gist of it is that the
limited studies that talk about the
effects on the skin talk about it being
anti-aging anti-inflammatory and
anti-carcinogenic also there's glycerin
ham in here which is a nice skin
balancing ingredient bentonite which is
an oil absorbing ingredient collagen
charcoal powder and then we get into the
preservatives so some other things that
are kind of negatives in here are sodium
laureth sulfate that's usually found in
shampoos I thought it was interesting
that it was in here so if you don't like
the sodium laureth sulfate if you're
allergic that's in here also
phenoxyethanol methylparaben and also
fragrances in here so if any of that
causes you alarm just so you know those
are the major ingredients the entire
ingredients that will be in the
description so now we're going to go
ahead and use this and I'm really
excited about it so what I'm going to go
ahead and remove my eye makeup because
you're not supposed to put it on your
eyes and I'll be right back I think up
is now officially removed so now we're
going to talk about how we use this so i
herb said your eye herb I always have
trouble saying I herb it just sounds
weird to me it says take a proper amount
of the carbonated bubble claim apps to
your whole face except for around the
eyes
after three to five minutes when the
bubbles have blown up absolutely do foam
massage with a little tepid water and
wash away
it also says do not use on open wound
eczema dermatitis etc Mimi box has a
little bit more detailed directions they
say it can be applied to unclean skin as
a first step in cleansing or it can be
applied to clean dry skin as the last
step in cleansing and you're supposed to
use the provided spatula so let's let's
look at the spatula here okay so here is
a container I don't see a spatula yet ah
there is a provided spatula dinging me
we have a winner and then we're going to
pull this off and it does say that it's
sensitive to air so you're supposed to
screw the top on really tight in between
uses whoa it smells just very kind of
fresh and clean a little bit citrusy but
mostly like a clean candle kind of set
so you're supposed to use the provided
spatula scoop I chestnut sized amount
and apply onto the face spread evenly
and smoothly across the face with either
the spatula or clean dry hands avoid
applying too close to the eyes nostrils
and lips and the product will begin to
bubble up leave on for five minutes and
then for an optional step you can gently
massage the bubbly mess all over the
face for one to two minutes and then
rinse off thoroughly with lukewarm water
maybe box also gives some little insider
tips it says you don't necessarily need
a chestnut sized amount you just have to
use what's good for your face to make
sure your face is covered with it and
then you're supposed to keep the lid on
the jar at all times when the product is
not in use continued exposure can - air
can speed up oxidation before we put
this on I'm going to do a close-up of my
skin with my makeup on and everything so
you can see how it looks before so here
is my skin I do still have a foundation
and you know a little bit of highlighter
and things like that on the skin but
we'll little bit up close and personal
and see if there's any difference when
this is over and this is done alright so
I'm a little scared to do this
something very nervous I don't know why
I'm so nervous
okay let's do it we can do this
okay I'm scooping it out and it
definitely feels a little rubbery I'm
going to use this much and hopefully
that's a good amount here we go it feels
rubbery ooh a little bit cooling I feel
it kind of squishing almost like
marshmallow feeling like when you squish
a marshmallow that's like really fluffy
and I can see it starting to puff up a
little bit what's crazy
oh yeah you see a bombing it's bobbing
it's puffing ha I don't feel anything
yet though
it just feels cold oh here come the
tingles here come the tingles ooh I want
to itch my nose so bad right now it just
feels itchy and I hear it popping see if
you can hear it can you hear my face but
it's not uncomfortable except for that I
just want to scratch the face so that's
the other thing if you're texturally
like you don't like textures you may not
like this because it really feels um
it's because it's moving very slightly
on my skin like these little bubbles
popping this is so weird
oh oh it feels like it's dripping down
the sides I feel kind of like if you
have like a bead of sweat and it starts
dripping down the side of your face
that's what it feels like in some places
right here is really itchy right now
yeah that's totally what it feels like
water falling itching down my face this
is not a pleasant feeling for me I don't
enjoy this at all I can see why some
people might enjoy this but it's not fun
to have I I thought this was going to be
so much fun and I am very uncomfortable
right now
oh I want to itch I want to itch Oh get
off can I can I wait hold on to this for
the next five minutes gosh
little three minutes three minutes left
got tough about three minutes I can do
it oh my gosh it's getting worse there's
more bubbles I thought it would feel
good but it doesn't it just feels really
tickly I'm looking who you might say I
look like a dirty Santa Claus oh it's
over
okay so I'm going to go ahead and wash
this off with some warm water and I'll
help you right back alright so that was
an experience
yeah I have the best job ever did the
value that I get to do this for a living
just makes me so happy but anyway let's
go ahead and zoom in on my face you can
see how it looks up close so here is my
after face how am I looking
do my pores look smaller do I look lens
so I'm going to go ahead and take this
Bioderma soaked cotton pad and rub it
down my face to see if there's any
makeup left because it was opposed to
remove my makeup so let's see and there
is absolutely no makeup on here so it
works great as a cleanser it totally
completely worked my face feels drier
and then a desert like my face feels
super tight if there was any mask that I
have used since I've been starting to do
what the K this one made my face feel
the driest definitely I don't know where
the glycerin is but I need some
moisturizer in my life right now I don't
know I don't know how I feel about this
I don't think I'm going to be using this
anymore I think I'm going to pass it on
it I'm about to send my reporters a
bunch of decluttered stuff I'm going to
see if anybody wants is I don't think
I'm going to use this again it did not
feel good it was so tickly the best
thing we can I can describe it in if you
had someone constantly tickling your
nose
the feather you know all over your skin
and you've ever been in a bubble bath
where you've let bubbles pop on your
skin and kind of let it it's not like
that like I thought it was going to be
more like that but it was more intense
in that like it was so incredibly tickly
the whole time and it just didn't feel
good I don't know I expected it to feel
more tingly rather than tickly and it
just it wasn't what I expected so I am
NOT a fan of this for me personally but
I can see where people would really
enjoy this if you do like that I'm very
sensitive to texture on my face so this
is definitely not made for me but that
doesn't mean it's not made for you
as far as the ingredients go there live
you're okay I mean there's yeah there's
definitely some things in here I wish
you didn't have in it the good
ingredients that are in here are not
like oh my gosh is so awesome I mean
there's collagen but I don't it's
certain the collagen gets a little close
to that 1% line where I think the 1%
line is as does the charcoal powder so I
don't know man I feel like this is more
of a fun product and a way to cleanse
your face this thing has so many good
reviews on Amazon everybody seems to
love this stuff I think I might be the
only person on the planet that doesn't
like it so it's just it was too tickly
for me I couldn't handle it but maybe
you can maybe this is something that
sounds fun to you and that you want to
try it I'm definitely not going to
discourage you from doing that it's just
it's not for me for my personal taste so
I want to thank you so much for watching
what the K this week I hope you enjoyed
it if you did definitely make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss what the K

testing out something very different
we're going to be doing a little lip
balm this is the skin food honey lip

intro and I saw it and I was like you
