bringing you another giveaway we love
giveaways I love giveaways I know you
love giveaways because giveaways means
free stuff for you and I have so much
fun shopping shopping is fabulous and I
can't always buy things for myself
because I have too much stuff so this
gives me an excuse to buy things when i
get to buy things for you the giveaway
is very different there are going to be
6 winners 6 Winterset is a lot of
winners because the the prizes aren't
going to be as huge this is going to be
a mystery giveaway which means that you
won't know exactly what you're going to
get until you win here are the
categories of things that I am giving
away I will be giving away an eyeliner a
blush a bronzer or highlighter a mineral
eyeshadow and a mascara I will also be
giving away this y'all that is
philosophies probably very bubbly bubble
bath and I'll show you what that looks
like and I can smell it through the top
and it smells so good everything came
from Sephora except for this this came
from Marshalls but its philosophy so
it's awesome even though came from our
sins it's the philosophy blossom rocks
so this right here I'm going to put a
list right here are the names of all of
the different companies that the
products come from that I have in my
possession my plans my friends this is
what you're going to do to enter you can
enter up to six times and let me explain
you can enter one time for each item
that I'm giving away so if you want all
6 items then you are going to type in
the comments eyeliner in one line blush
in another line mascara in another line
and so forth for whichever items you
want one item upper
why please please only put one time for
each one so don't go eyeliner eyeliner
eyeliner eyeliner eyeliner because the
only gonna count one time and you'll
probably be flag for spam I'm not gonna
disqualify you for doing that but
there's no point you're only gonna be
entered one time you can type other
things in the comments too if you want
to say hey what's up i like your video i
just subscribed if you want to if you
want to say other things that's fine but
make sure you put whatever it is that
you want in the end or the beginning of
your comments so i know what to enter
you in for little disclaimer in here i
had a little issue with my other
giveaway where one of the winners
expressed pretty much that they were not
interested in winning so i ended up
picking a new winner and I'm going to
reserve the right to do that again if
you expressed to me that you really
don't want the stuff then I'm not going
to send it to you I'm going to find
someone else give it to because it is a
waste of my money to give it to you if
you are not going to use it so please
only enter for the things you really
really want the other fun thing about
this is if you win I will send you a
list of your choices of things to get
you that I will send you okay so for
example I have a bunch of different
eyeliners from many different companies
you may like one company better than
another I will let you know what I have
and you can pick from that list which
product you would like isn't that cool
what's up only the person who wins is
gonna find out what my stash is like of
that item I'd rather keep everything
else a secret for everyone else so that
i can give things away in a future
giveaway if you live in north america
you can enter for the bubble bath it is
heavy and i just don't want to ship it
really far away because it's super
expensive to do that everything else can
be shipped internationally you need to
be subscribed to this channel in order
to win you must be 18 or older or have
your parents permission so that i don't
look like the creepy lady who asks for
your address this giveaway will end on
december 15th i will announce the
winners on either the 60 probably the
16th and let you know who won when I
send you a message through YouTube and I
put up my video please contact me as

pick a new winner good luck in the
giveaway I'm so excited to give this
stuff to you mad love I will see you in

some kind of review video because it's
shopping time and we need to be knowing
what to buy for people and I want to
tell you my experience with the stuff I
