the K where we talked about Korean
beauty products and decide whether
they're worth their money or not today
we're going to be talking about a cotton
candy scented BB cream so stay tuned as
I mentioned a moment ago today we're
going to be talking about the holy Co
holy does sweet cotton poor cover baby
SPF 30 PA plus plus and if you don't
know what a BB cream is it stands for
beauty balm which is it supposed to kind
of even the skin tone some people use a
BB cream underneath the foundation to
kind of bump up the coverage give the
skin some skin benefits things like that
so this one is unique in that it is
supposed to smell like cotton candy so I
did the test and I walked over to my
children and I asked them if it smelled
like candy or if it smelled like makeup
both of my children my vibro and my
eight-year-old both told me that it
smelled like candy my husband said it
smelled like makeup so for me I feel
like it smells like a mix of the two you
can smell a little bit of sweetness to
it but it definitely smells like makeup
to me this is a one ounce tube of
product which is the same as most
foundations you'll find the drugstore it
cost me seven dollars and fifty cents
plus free shipping on Amazon from Holika
Holika I ordered it on February 22nd and
it was delivered on March 2nd so not too
bad for the shipping time you can also
get this at Walmart for 10 dollars and
17 cents on their website or you can go
to holy Co holy Co website and pay $14
so definitely go to Amazon rather than
to the holy Coleco website these are the
claims for this product they say it is a
melting BB cream with cotton candy
melting texture it naturally goes onto
the skin there's a little bit of grammar
issue so I'm just going to kind of
paraphrase there's a sugar ingredients
that moisturize rough skin the cotton
cotton extract absorbs oil giving a soft
and silky feeling to the skin there's
also lotus flower extract that tightens
pores
Nonnie extract protects sensitive skin
from external irritation giving elastic
and clear skin so I guess like it
improves your elasticity
it has a sweet romantic scent I wouldn't
say it has a romantic sign I don't know
about that but it is a little bit sweet
so of course I had to look up the
ingredient to see whether these claims
were true or not and they do include a
lot of these ingredients that they talk
about but they're way down at the bottom
on the ingredient list for example
there's portal eka Ola Ola say mmm
portal a call Oh Laura sia extract it's
a weed-like plant that may have
antioxidant properties there's also the
sin IAM mite mmm it's sunday barakat
doggin a proscenium Mar Myra Silla fruit
extract that's an antioxidant and then
Goffe p.m. her base young extract as
cottonseed oil extract that's one of the
things they say is in here they didn't
say the other ones I couldn't find a lot
of information on that at all though as
except for that it's skin conditioning
but there wasn't a lot of from the sites
that I use I couldn't find a lot of
information it was research basis said
that it worked also the sacrum of fist
in there um extract I know I'm
butchering these today I just can't
sugar cane extract I'd like to find was
it it was skin conditioning I couldn't
find any like really good solid research
that the stuff actually worked so this
may be one of those products that just
kind of sounds good but doesn't actually
do anything especially since the
ingredients are so far down on the list
but what there is a lot of is some kind
of negative ingredients so the first one
is cyclo penta siloxane which doesn't
have any harm to the skin but they have
found that it can harm the environment
so you may want to use a cotton pad with
some makeup remover and then throw this
away rather than using a cleanser and
washing it down the sink also on at the
hexyl Methot oxy cinemate which is a
sunscreen in this the FDA doesn't have a
problem with it and concentrations less
than 7.5% I don't know how much is in
this but it has been shown to have form
own mimicking effects on laboratory
animals and it can be a skin irritant so
just so you know that is in here also it
has talc and Sonam
ethanol so if you're sensitive to those
you don't want this also dimethicone if
you don't like Mexico and you don't want
this and then finally fragrance a lot of
people had issues with fragrance so that
is in here as well right now it seems
super hokey I have used this a bunch of
times and I do want to show you how it
goes on and we're going to do an all-day
wear test for this I do not have
anything on my face I did not put on any
moisturizer I didn't put on any primer I
don't want anything messing with this I
did promise my kids I would take them to
the indoor pool today and that is
definitely going to make a difference as
far as the wear time of this but because
I've worn this I don't know four times I
guess I can talk to you about what it's
like when I don't take kids to an indoor
pool we're going to put this on just
half of the face
all right this by the way the sponge is
by a brand called beauty junkies they
have really nice sponges they're very
soft I do like the Beauty Blender just a
little better than their brand but not
by much
these are a lot cheaper I like these
better than the Real Techniques ones
though because they're softer so one
thing I've noticed about this the more I
use it is that when you use a little bit
of amount you get a very light coverage
and it does build very nicely and you
can build it up to a good solid medium
coverage which is really nice for a BB
cream because you don't always get that
with a BB cream so I'm going to go ahead
and zoom in and show you what my face
looks like with just half of my face
done
really swimming I really like about this
is that even when you build it up it
never seems to get cakey for me like
some some foundations and things if you
put too much on it just looks like a hot
mess and you look like you're wearing a
mask and I don't find that that happens
with this BB cream which is really nice
I've tried this BB cream with a
foundation brush I've also tried it with
one of those like when he called lucky
our teeth brushes I tried it with the
Mota version of it and I really prefer
it with the without with a sponge I feel
like it goes on the best but you can
really choose whatever works for you I
definitely can smell the sweet scent
more as I'm applying it than I do
straight from the tube straight from the
tube but Japanese smells more like
makeup but I can still smell that sweet
candy like scent which is kind of nice I
like it I think it's nice but you may
not like it if you're sensitive to Sun
it's not overpoweringly fragrant but you
can definitely smell it so I'm going to
go ahead and do a very light look of
makeup and I'll be right back how I bang
my foot on a chair how I'm good don't
cut it so we've got our full face of
makeup on it's funny how like you go
through this where you like plan on
putting on a light face to make up and
the next thing you know you're like Lady
gaga like I don't feel like I went that
far but I'm not too makeup on today that
I wasn't planning on putting on too much
but what you need to know is I'm not
setting my face with setting powder I
also didn't use concealer Shea because I
don't want anything messing with this I
did put a little bit of my later on and
a little bit of blush in case you're
curious what I use today I use the Tarte
make believing yourself palette on my
eyes and then I use the dose of colors a
little lipstick and truffle on my lip
now that I've gone and done a couple
things I got my face on it is now 12:30
3 in the afternoon so I'm going to go
ahead get dressed in my swimsuit take
the kids to the pool and then we'll
check in when we get home here's the
full clothes
I was looking before the day starts well
at 12:30 but we're going to do 12 hour
wear tests though how we doing check in
time for the cotton candy BT cream I
just got back from the pool with my kids
I only got in two like here but I did
get splash in the face a couple of times
then I tried really hard not to wipe my
face so it just kind of dried naturally
so there may be like some weird spots I
didn't overall it's looking pretty good
it is currently 408 in the afternoon so
we are at 12 31 32 33 33 and a half
hours I'm about to get ready for our
what to the makeup chat which is going
to be starting at 5 o'clock so I got to
check it a little early I normally do
like a 4 hour but I don't have time for
that because I got to get ready for chat
so let's go ahead and do a close up and
see how this is lasting all right it's
very dark behind me but I'll face is
what matters right I think it's really
looking good
like really good especially considering
I got splashed in the face multiple
times I didn't like submerge my face but
I got like little drips everywhere and I
think it's looking pretty stinking good
so I will see you around 9:30 whenever I
can get back on camera after I put the
kids to bed so I was going to do a
12-hour wear test but I forgot to get
the video edited because it's got to go
up tomorrow which is Monday so we're
going to stop it here it is currently 7
minutes after 10:00 we are at 9 and a
half hours of where time so this is
beyond a typical school or work day I
have to mention it during that chat the
collective brain made me cry oh that
might have also impacted besides the
water getting on my space at the pool
being sprinkle on me you know the tears
they didn't it didn't necessarily get
passed here though so hopefully it
didn't impact it too much but yes I just
wanted to let you know there were some
tears I'm not going to go into it
because I'll start crying again
I don't want to do that but they were
happy tears let me show you very close
up the look of my BB cream now that we
are at nine and a half hours having worn
this a few times I can give you an
overall opinion of it I can say that it
does seem to increase in the wear time
when you use it with a silicone-based
primer it definitely extends aware now I
did not use a silicon primer today -
this shows you know without that the
less you use the less is going to work
today I use quite a bit so there is
quite a bit left on my face but if you
go for that lighter coverage not going
to last that long but if you do the more
full coverage which is more like a
medium coverage then it does last a
significant amount of time you know get
you through a school or work day without
significant fading which is fantastic
especially for seven dollars and fifty
says an immense thing and amazing so
performance wise I really like this a
lot I like to finish on my skin I like
the way that it feels I like the way
that it smells all of that stuff is all
fantastic my big gripe about this which
is why it's losing one of my hearts in
the rating is the claims and that it
claims to be you know have these amazing
ingredients in it but they're so low on
the ingredient list and there's so many
ingredients that are not as good in this
that make it not good that's kind of how
I feel about it so you have to kind of
decide where you stand you just want a
product it works really well or do you
want high quality ingredients on your
face and then naturally what's going to
tell you whether this is something you
want to purchase or not so that's where
I stand on it so that's it for what the
