I'm Jen and this is your Daily Makeup Minute
for December 21, 2017
The Ordinary is now available to everyone
at Sephora!
But not the foundation.
Check their site for skincare goodness.
Available today from Siren Noir Cosmetics,
the Limited Edition Winter Solstice Bundle
- $12
A company called &quot;The Crayon Case&quot; - which
says they are &quot;a cosmetic line dedicated to
amateur makeup users&quot; - will drop their Box
of Crayons palette on January 1
Kat Von D issued this photo to tell the story
of an upcoming NON-collection called “Crushes.”
In her words, these will be &quot;special, one-off
products that don’t necessarily belong to
a particular collection, and are just great
products that stand alone on their own....Sometimes,
less IS more&quot;
Kristen Leanne sends a sneak of her upcoming
collab with Urban Decay, which launches in
January.
She wants you to know that this is not a Unicorn
theme, these are horses and stags.
So we did not violate our promise of no Unicorns
until 2018!
That’s it for now.
We'll see you here same time Tomorrow!
Look for Makeup Minute Extras on my Instagram,
and Don't forget our full-length weekly newscast,
What's Up in Makeup, every Sunday morning
on YouTube!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
