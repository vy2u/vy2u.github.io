video of mine I don't typically do
tutorial type videos but I've been
getting a lot of requests lately and
this was a tip that helped me a lot when
I was traveling and it's also a great
way to speed up your routine in the
morning because it requires you to think
less so that you can move faster it's
also a great way to save money because
you don't need as many products in order
to get a ton of different looks so if
you're curious about what this chip is
stay tuned when I was traveling recently
to Canada I needed to cut down how much
makeup
I was bringing so I brought two pallets
Orsi don't have to be the pallets that
you use but these are the ones that I
brought one you're going to need a
neutral palette it can be this it can be
the Urban Decay Naked basics palette it
can be something from the drugstore it
doesn't matter as long as it's got a
light shade a medium shade and a deep
shade for your skin tone when I say a
medium shade I'm talking about a shade
that is one to two shades darker than
your natural skin tone a lighter shades
going to be one or two shades lighter
and then a shade deeper is going to be
one to two shades deeper and then the
middle tone shade does that make sense
so this one has a lot of options I
happen to really really like this
palette even though I don't typically
care for Tarte eyeshadows this one is
fabulous and then you're going to need a
palette with colors in it so I picked to
bring the Tarte make believe in yourself
palette I don't know why it's all part
but I brought this because it didn't
have a lot of neutrals in it and it had
a lot of color options for a lot of
different looks I could go warm I could
go cool I could go bright color I could
go more neutral color and that's why I
chose this one I was also going to
generation Beauty in Toronto so I wanted
to be able to have the option of putting
something shiny on my lids the brushes
I'm going to use for this are the brand
new Mota prismatic brush set these
actually aren't out yet they come out
sometime this month in July if it's
beyond July these are already out you
should be able to find them at your
local Walmart
I love motor brushes because they are
very high quality for the
this particular brush set does come with
this holographic case which i think is
absolutely beautiful and you may have
seen the motor prismatic the base brush
set those are amazing as well so they I
guess they just decided they were going
to extend the pattern to their regular
brush line which i think is pretty smart
because it is thinking beautiful I just
applied my eyeshadow primer and now I'm
going to put in the crease color so this
is your mid-tone shade you're going to
take a fluffy blending brush it's a bit
rounded on the top something that has a
little bit of give you don't want to
brush this too stiff but you also don't
want one that's too fluffy because a
product is just going to flop everywhere
you want something kind of in the middle
and you'll see as I'm putting it on
you'll see the bend of the brush that's
exactly the kind of brush you want and
just kind of windshield wiper it up into
the crease area and this part is the
part you're going to do every single day
exactly the same depending on how much
real estate you got going on over here
from your eye socket to your brow bone
you might want to bring it up on your
brow bone just a little bit but you
definitely don't want to bring it all
the way up to the brow I like to have
about half color and half not colored so
now I'm going to take this brush this
one is a little bit more dense I'm going
to dip it into the deeper color so I'm
going to go ahead and use this deeper
color I could use this one but I want my
eye shadow to be a little bit darker
today it's really up to you and your
personal preference and what you find
works for your skin tone and I'm just
going to tap off my brush and stamp in
the outer corner just like that just a
stamp it's not blended yet don't worry
now I'm going to go back to that same
blending brush you don't even need to
wipe it off in between colors if you
don't want to if you want to you can and
then just kind of blend that up
and the deeper you want your look the
more you can include so I want to make
money then deeper so I'm going to add a
second little punch of deepness and I'm
going to put it all the way up in my eye
socket but you have to decide what you
like whether you like it blended all the
way through or if you like it less I'm
going to pull mine all the way through
for today but once you do this a couple
of times you'll figure out what you like
on your eyes everybody's eye shape is
different and I think that's what makes
it difficult to follow a lot of
tutorials is that your eye shape is
different than the person who's doing
the tutorial so how do you know how to
do it on your face this is something
that works for all eyes shapes now I'm
going to take the lightest shade and I'm
going to blend my transition color my
medium color all the way up to the brow
bone now this color is going to be just
a little bit lighter than my skin tone
means the same fluffy brush this will
also help you lighten up anything that
got a little too dark if you feel a
little uncomfortable with how dark it
got so all of that is what you're going
to do every single day that's the same
routine every day and this is where you
mix it up all you're going to do now is
pick one color and put it all over your
lid that's it now I'm in the middle of
testing the Jaclyn hill palette for
review so instead of using the Tarte
palette I'm going to use the Jaclyn hill
palette and again you could pick any of
these colors to put all over your lid
the darker you go the smokier you're
going to be and the more deep set your
eyes are going to look if you want your
eyelids to pop out you're going to use a
lighter color I am really curious about
this green here I've been wanting to use
it so I'm going to go ahead and dip this
little tiny brush you can use a bigger
brush than this but because I want to
use this set I'm going to use this
little brush and I'm just going to apply
it all over my lid up to that crease
line
I like smaller brushes because then you
can get you really really detailed of
exactly where you want to put the
product and if you have smaller lid
space it's easier to work with
see you can add another step which would
be to go back into that mid toad shape
and just really define the crease with
this little brush so I'm going to go
ahead and do that and that will just
kind of blend your lid color a little
bit into the Korean if you made any
mistakes where it's not completely
smooth this will help you smooth it out
I kind of feel like I want to do a
little bit more this is completely
unnecessary this is another way I'm
actually going to take my fluffy brush
and bring it just a little further up
onto my brow bone because I'm feeling
like I want a little warmth up there
and that's it the look is finished
however many shadows you have in your
life that's how many looks you can
create like this and you can switch it
up every single day without any thought
to it you don't use high-end eyeshadows
you don't you just use what you have and
you have a completely new eye look every
single day I'm going to go ahead and
finish this up with liner and lashes so
you can see the complete look all I did
that complete the look was add a little
bit of black liquid liner and some
mascara and it's done you don't have to
change it up every single day but it's
an easy way to change if your look very
very quickly without having to think a
whole lot and when you're busy in the
morning and you're trying to leave and
you don't have time to think about what
you're going to do this is a great way
to change up your look so I want to
