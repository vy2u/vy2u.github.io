that when we upload videos and people
watch them and then things are
misinterpreted you can't go back and add
the stuff into the video so I think I
need to add some information to your
bank of knowledge right about now as
some of you may know I did yesterday a
livestream where I unboxed my final
Birchbox and as you might have seen if
you watched that video I was a little
down in the dumps yesterday I was in a
funk ok I think everybody gets in a funk
but not everybody broadcast it so I
wanted to give you an update and let you
know that I am much better today much
much better a lot of that is due to you
thank you if you left a comment under
that video if you messaged me on Twitter
I got private emails I got so much love
from the community after that video if
you didn't watch the video let me give
you a quick summary basically I was sad
I was cancelling my Birchbox because I'd
been a Birchbox member for a really long
time and I just wasn't enjoying it
anymore that was the gist of that part
and the other part was that I felt like
I needed to cut back on my output for my
youtube channel now was misinterpreted
by a lot of people in that I'm taking a
break from YouTube that is not true at
all I am NOT taking a break from YouTube
the way that I had my schedule before
now was that five days a week
I did the makeup minute which is that
one minute news show then on Sundays we
have what's up in makeup which is the
full-length production the big news show
then on top of that on Monday Wednesday
and Friday I was uploading edited review
videos for you so what I'm gonna be
doing now is instead of Monday Wednesday
and Friday I'm gonna be uploading those
on Tuesday and Thursday that's it I'm
just cutting back one of the review
videos because what was happening was so
I was trying to kind of relax on Sunday
a little bit and kind of have an evening
off but then a video was due on Monday
so I couldn't really
relax on Sundays because I had to make
sure that video was ready for Monday and
if I waited until Monday to do it then I
would run behind and I would be editing
all day long scrambling on Monday trying
to get this video up and stressing
myself out the other thing was making
sure I had a video up on Friday because
Friday's the day that I film what's up
in makeup so making sure that my video
was ready to go up on Friday the
Wednesday video was no problem at all so
I was putting unnecessary pressure on
myself and this is the thing last year
2017 was the best year of my entire life
I have never been happier in life than I
am right now overall but I don't tell
you that so how are you supposed to know
if I don't tell you so I'm telling you I
had a fantastic year last year my
audience doubled in size I've gotten so
much love and feedback from the
community it was a fantastic year last
year where my family's financially
stable really for the first time I live
in a house that I love I have a card
that I love I have a family that I love
we're taking we went to Iceland last
year which was incredible we also went
to Canada last year which is incredible
my husband's business is doing amazing
everything is really really good right
now but I haven't told you that so I'm
telling you now
life is good it broke my heart because I
got one particular comment from a person
that I really care about who's been a
subscriber of mine for a really long
time saying you know what Jen you chose
this life you chose this life you chose
to quit teaching you chose to do this
and this is your fault was basically the
way I interpreted it whether she meant
it that way or not that's the way I
interpreted it yes I did choose this
life and I love this life I am so
thankful that I quit teaching it was the
best choice I ever could have made for
my mental health does that mean my life
is perfect no absolutely not
I get in funks just like everybody and
if I'm in a live stream that most people
don't do live streams because they're
very very real some days I'm gonna be in
a funk because I'm a human being I'm a
person so it wasn't that my life was
coming crashing down it was just you
know telling you how I feel so the main
point of this video which is to clarify
my upload schedule let you know what
that is and let you guys know that I am
perfectly okay today
and feeling so much better and a lot of
that is due to the wonderful comments
that I received from the community I
mean you guys are amazing you right now
you watching this you are amazing and I
appreciate you so thank you so much for
watching my videos I really appreciate
it
I'm gonna go film two other videos right
now hopefully before my kids get off the
school bus we'll see and mad love to you
and I will see you in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
