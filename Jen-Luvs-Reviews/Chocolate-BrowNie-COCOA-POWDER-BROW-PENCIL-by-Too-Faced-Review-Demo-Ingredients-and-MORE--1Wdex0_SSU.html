review on the Too Faced chocolate
brownie eyebrow pencil yes no one's
talking about this and I don't know why
welcome to my rapid review this is going
to be a very detailed review in five
minutes or less I don't know why no one
is talking about this brow pencil it was
kind of the hidden gem of the new Too
Faced spring launch I'll tell you right
now I really like this but now I need to
tell you why I like it but before I tell
you why I like it I need to give you the
ingredient details so first of all to
face does claim to be a cruelty free
company but they were bought by Estee
Lauder which is not cruelty free so
depending on your level of cruelty free
honest you may say two-face is or isn't
cruelty free this is not a vegan product
it does contain beeswax and it is made
in the United States it's currently
available at Too Faced calm ulta.com
macy's calm and also hsn.com with flex
pay it comes in four shades taupe soft
brown deep brown and auburn and it'll
run you $23 you do get point zero one
ounces of product which equals 0.28
grams which equals out to eighty two
dollars per gram which is very
inexpensive per gram for a brow product
the only other brow product that
competes with this is the benefit goof
proof a brow pencil that I also did a
review on this one is one dollar more
expensive so it is just a little bit
more expensive price per gram the goof
proof does have six shades while this
one only has four but the Too Faced has
an Auburn shade where the goof proof
does not goof proof has a darker shade
than this but also has a lighter shade
for more blonde hair so that may make
you choose one or the other they're very
similar as far as their format in that
they have slanted tips this one is more
of a teardrop shape the benefit and the
Too Faced is more of a straight line I'm
going to go ahead and show you some
swatch comparisons right now of the
different brands of brow pencil that I
currently own both high-end and
drugstore and you'll be able to see the
slanted tip on the Too Faced
and how that applies I personally really
like a thicker tip because I feel like I
can get into my thicker brows but if you
have thinner brows you may want to opt
for something like the Anastasio brow
Wiz or the Loreal brow definer because
it has a sharper tip the Too Faced is
one of the cooler toned of the ones that
I own it's closer to the Loreal brow
definer but the Loreal brow definer is a
little more black looking but it is
cooler tone compared to the other brow
products that I own so if that's
attractive to you then you may want to
get the Too Faced Browning as far as
ingredients go for this product there
are two ingredients that are allergens
for some people one of them is called
benzyl alcohol and it is a solvent and a
preservative and also benzyl benzoate
which is anti and antimicrobial so those
are both allergens to some people it
does have a strong chocolate scent the
first source is something called ethyl
vanillin which is actually derived from
vanilla it's kind of a cheaper vanilla
kind of flavoring they also use it in
foods it does have artificial fragrance
in it so if you don't like artificial
fragrance you're not going to like this
but it also has both cocoa powder and
cocoa butter in this product and it
really does have that strong typical to
face chocolate scent that you will find
in the chocolate bar palette and also in
the chocolate Soleil bronzers and it
smells really good to me but if you
don't like chocolate scent you will not
like it I can't smell it once it's on my
brows but when I open it up and I'm
applying it I can definitely smell it I
do feel like the scent is starting to
fade the longer that I own the product
when I first got it it was very strong
and now you can still smell it but it's
definitely not as strong so as far as
performance of this brow product it
works just as well as all of my other
favorites I have so many favorite brow
products because they don't really need
a brow product to do that much I don't
want it to be sticky I don't want it to
be heavy I don't want to have to scrub
on my eyebrow in order to make it work
and I have lots of products that do that
for me and this one is no different
performs very very well but it is
definitely not for someone that wants a
thin brow look I do have trouble getting
it to give me that really sharp edge of
my brow on the outside because it
doesn't have a taper like the benefit
one does so that's kind of my only
critique as far as the way that it comes
out
but I do really like it it stays on all
day long I have no problems with it
smudging or smearing after the product
sets you want Instagram browser this may
not be the product for you because it's
not super opaque but if you like a more
natural brow like I do this is
definitely something you might want to
consider so I want to thank you so much
for watching this rapid review I hope
you enjoyed it if you did definitely

reviews and longer reviews and other
