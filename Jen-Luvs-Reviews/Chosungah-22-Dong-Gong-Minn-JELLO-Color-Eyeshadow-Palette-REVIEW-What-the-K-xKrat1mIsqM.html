the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to see if they are worth your
hard earned money today we're going to
be talking about the Chosun no 22
dong dong min jell-o color kit and I
can't wait to show you how this thing
works I just got back from the IMATS in
New York I had a great time I have a ton
of stuff to show you I'm thinking about
filming a whole video just like a haul
video as like a way for me to show you
what I got to see what you're most
interested in me focusing on for a
review because it's more important for
me to ask you what you want rather than
me to just do what I want because it's
all about what's helpful for you I think
I am going to do an IMATS haul sometime
this week and show you everything that I
got but that's not what this video is
about this video is about Joe Sangha 22
and this dong gongmin
jello color kit it has a very silly name
and there's a very silly product inside
the only place I know of that you can
get this is sephora.com it is $39 and
you get six eyeshadows inside as you can
see they kind of transfer over to the
mirror a little bit they are dimethicone
based so they've got this like squishy
kind of feeling to them a little color
poppy but a little bit more they kind of
remind me of like if you make chocolate
pudding and but you cook it and it gets
that like film on top of the chocolate
pudding where it's like kind of hard and
then underneath is real soft like that's
what it feels like it's like the hard
like I don't know like the top of I
don't you understand what I'm saying I'm
hoping you understand what I'm saying
but then color comes off so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you swatches right now of
these as you can see they are very
lightly pigmented there isn't a whole
lot of pigmentation and you're gonna see
that in the application in just a minute
the brush swatches don't help them much
so in this video I'm going to be showing
you the fingertip application because I
personally feel like that's the best way
to apply it and that's the way that's
recommended by switch chosun go 22 on
their website but be
or we do the demo I want to tell you a
little bit about the product from
Sephora it says that it's a moist and
fluffy jelly like formula it works like
a cushion that clings to the skin around
your eyes the dong gongmen jello color
eyeshadow palette features
natural-looking eye makeup that
perfectly blends in with matte and pearl
sparkling shade these shadows are
perfect for glamorous looks create a
fiery variety of eye makeup styles a
matte finish shaded effect or sparkling
pearl and views with nourishing argan
oil shea butter and it precisely adheres
the eyes without creasing and we're
going to talk about that so you get the
six eyeshadows in here they are about 2
grams apiece there are one point nine
eight grams apiece leading this palette
to be three dollars and twenty eight
cents per gram which is about middle of
the range for Sephora brand pricing it's
not inexpensive it's not expensive it
just kind of falls in the middle its
product is made in Korea there's no
indication anywhere that this brand is
cruelty free so I am assuming that they
are not cruelty free it is also not
vegan because there is carmine and some
of the shadows like I was mentioning
earlier there's dimethicone is the
number one ingredient in this product
there's tons of silicones in this
product
there's also mineral oil in this product
so if you have dry lids this would
probably be a good one for you to try
for that purpose but hold off don't buy
it yet
there's also mica talc and
phenoxyethanol some people are sensitive
to talc and phenoxyethanol specifically
I haven't heard as much about mica
sensitivity but just so you know that's
in here now Sephora says that it has
argan oil and shea butter in it but I
could not find when I looked at the Box
they've made it this dark dark gray and
then they put the print in black so it's
very difficult to read but as I looked
at this I could not find anywhere on
here argan oil or shea butter and I
looked up the ingredients to make sure
they weren't like code scientific names
for argan oil and shea butter and
they're not I don't believe this
contains that and that really makes me
irritated that they submitted that to
Sephora and not only did they submit
that information to Sephora but they did
not check to make sure those ingredients
were on the box the ingredients are not
listed on Sephora's website it just says
that in the description that has argan
oil and shea butter so that's strike
number one dishonesty is a huge strike
for me for anybody in any
things so yeah not happy with them about
that though that was what I wanted to
tell you about the pot before we try it
so let's go ahead and try to put it on
the eye so I'm just gonna do just a
quick eye look with this you can see how
it comes out and I'll just tell you
ahead of time I'm not happy with this so
we're gonna put this shade right here
all over the lid I have no primer on I
found that with a primer they just slip
and slide so what we're gonna do it with
with no primer just to show you and you
can see there is a little bit of
hopefully you guys can see us like
consuming enough for you guys to see
there's a little bit of pigmentation
which is nice it's a very very
natural-looking pigmentation now I'm
gonna go ahead and try to pop these
shades I'm gonna try to take this one
and put it on the outer corner to deepen
it up a little bit but I don't think
yeah it's not going to work I think I'm
gonna have to use something deeper we're
gonna try to pop it up into the crease
with the fingertip it's like no tools
makeup challenge over here and that's
not really doing much but we'll keep
going anyway and I did try multiple
brushes with this and nothing seemed to
work the fluffier fluffier it was the
worse it seemed to work so let's go into
this deeper shade right here and try to
pop that on the outer corner and you can
see there's just nothing happening here
there's nothing happening just really
difficult to get any color payoff at all
okay so I'm gonna go ahead just for the
fun of it and throw some of this red on
just so you can see how that looks so
let's just put that let's put it over
top of that other shade kind of put it
on the brow bone a little bit to try to
blend that in and you can see it's
difficult to do this with the fingertips
it really is to get the color actually
that doesn't look too bad
this is actually the nicest this has
ever looked and that's it ha ha ha this
doesn't look that nice actually it's not
so terrible doesn't my nose no okay so
I'm gonna go ahead and throw this one on
the outer corner this is just so I can
show you try to deepen up the outer
corner a bit
and just for fine we'll go into the
black I tried using it as an eyeliner
yeah that didn't work I'm just kind of
build it on top just as a demonstration
of the color on the eye a little too low
that actually looks better than any
other look I've ever created with this
yeah I get to share it with you I'm
gonna go ahead and put this lighter
shade on the brow bone a little bit kind
of brighten up the brow bone all right
so I shadow look is finished I'm gonna
go ahead and zoom in so you can see how
it came out um and then I'm gonna do
liner in lashes and then we'll be back
to discuss I think that Sunday I'm not
doing false lashes I'm just doing the
mascara today oh by the way if you're
curious what's on my lips it is the
brand new lipstick by Shani from total
makeup junkie 101 she has a new cosmetic
line called irani cosmetics this is the
shade tattoo and it's gorgeous and I am
loving it so far this is the first time
I've put it on so I can't speak to where
- I'm gonna do a full review of these at
some point but it's got like this like
peach glitter in it it's really cool
I've never seen anything like this so
I'm curious to see since I haven't done
like wear test anything how these things
are gonna work but yeah super excited
about these lipsticks thank you is Shani
for sending these to me I appreciate it
but full review coming so anyway so this
is how I feel final thoughts on each of
summer 22 I don't like it at all like I
always try to find somebody that this
will work for because even the thing
that I think is the junkie Asst prod
achter will work for someone and I feel
like the only people this is gonna work
for people that have really dry lids
that like a more natural look I'm not
sure if I mentioned there is another
shade selection of this I'll put an
image of it right there and I would not
recommend this from my personal taste
like what I think it's really really not
good
I mean you can always lay like glitters
and things over top of it it is very
moist so you might be able to like lay
some shadows over top of it and make it
look nice but are
looking for a shadow base are you
looking for a shadow look you looking
for a shadow base maybe I don't know
maybe this might work but also faded
near to immediately I would say within
four hours of wearing the first two
times I VI use this it was completely
gone I mean you could barely see any
color on my eye so I don't know if that
would impact shadows that you lay
overtop of it but okay I'm interrupting
the video for a minute because I decided
because I just looked in the mirror it's
been six hours since I filmed the video
and I just have to show you my eye
shadow like what like gone gone gone
gone gone gone no eye shadow left it's
called the dong dong man it should be
the gong gone man because after about
four hours it's pretty much gone gone
gone I just wanted to show you that I
was like an afterthought so I'm gonna go
ahead and bring you back to the regular
video already in progress this is
officially the worst product i've ever
tried for what the gate because and the
dishonesty of the company in description
i can't even speak to you how upset that
makes me and the and just it fades and
it doesn't work and it just makes me
upset I'm really glad I had the
opportunity to try it because it's
always fun to try things of all
different levels but it's just bad it's
just really really really bad and I just
I can't even like I honestly can't
recommend this anybody I just can't it's
terrible it's a terrible product thanks
so much for watching with the K this
week I hope you enjoyed it
next week on with the cake we're going
to be reviewing this one a face
moisturizer it's by a brand called lady
Ken and it looks a lot appropriate in my
opinion but we're gonna try it anyway
because you know inappropriate fun
sometime but anyway we're gonna be
trying this next week I hope you
subscribe so that you I can tune in and
thanks again for watching mad love and
I'll see you
Nina bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
