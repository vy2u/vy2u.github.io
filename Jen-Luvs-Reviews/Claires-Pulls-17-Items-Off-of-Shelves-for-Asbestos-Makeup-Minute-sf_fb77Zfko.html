weekend makeup minute for December 23rd
2017 children's retailer Claire's is
allegedly pulling 17 makeup items off of
the shelves after concerned mother in
Rhode Island sent her six-year-old
glitter makeup palette to an independent
lab test results revealed tremolite
asbestos which is toxic and
cancer-causing rubbing further the
mother a lawyer named Christie Warner
purchased 17 additional products from 9
different states results showed asbestos
and every single product tested Friday
afternoon Claire's released an official
statement saying as a result of today's
inquiry from wja RTV we've taken the
precautionary measure of pulling the
items in question from sale and will be
conducting an immediate investigation
into the alleged issues I called
Claire's to confirm the news story
representatives said she had not heard
of the claims and directed me to what
she called the corporate phone number
the automated message stated that the
number was customer service for their
sister store icing and that they are
open during regular business hours I
will update you with information as soon
as it becomes available as no major news

the filming of this video for the full
story with photos of the items click the
