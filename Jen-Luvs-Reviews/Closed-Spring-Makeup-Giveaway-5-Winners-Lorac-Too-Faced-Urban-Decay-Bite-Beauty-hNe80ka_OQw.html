exciting giveaway for you some of you
may know that I kind of collect things
over time I see a good deal on something
I see a gift set I see things like that
and I'm like oh and i buy it and I break
it up into pieces and I give pieces away
well recently two-faced had a sale on
their website and also lorac was on
hautelook so I was like ooh these would
be nice for give away prizes so I have a
two-faced product for you and Alaric
product for you and then I was like
really wants to just do two winners so I
decided to do five winners with some of
the other stuff that I've collected over
time so here we go all of it of course
though is brand new it sits in my
giveaway box I've not swatched anything
or touch anything so let me show you the
things that i'll be giving away starting
with the two-faced and the lorac stuff
so lorac i got the the holiday gifts
that i'm not sure if you saw it but it
was the one that had all the different
looking chocolate bars they had that one
on hautelook so I got that and I want to
give you one of those so this is the one
that is the bronze shadow palette and
it's tantalizing cocoa and this one is
just gorgeous and I thought about
keeping this one but I already have a
lot of colors like this so i decided i
wanted to give it to you they're all
shimmery this one is a nice um like just
like a regular beige this one is more
like a coppery kind of color this is a
little warm brown and then this is like
a great black i have nots watched them
so i don't know one hundred percent how
they swatch but i'm sure if you look up
on google online you will be able to
find some swatches somewhere on
somebody's blog now for two-faced um we
I got you guys the love sweet love
palette and I thought this was so
stinking cute it's like a little like
book and it's got your beautiful little
mirror here and then it's got it says
when I saw you I fell in love and you
smiled because you knew and that's
supposedly by William Shakespeare even
that doesn't sound like Shakespeare to
me but they say it is so I guess I
believe it and then it's got a day look
and a night look using the products and
then you open it up and there are your
beautiful products and it says love Too
Faced and I'm just going to flip that
screen
over and you've got one two three four
five six shadows you have vanilla sugar
mocha ice ganache strawberry cream Bert
sage and licorice glitz this one looks
mad up here this one here is um looks
like a satiny shimmery this one looks
like it might be a satin doesn't really
look shimmery this one looks like a set
and this one looks like a satin and that
one has looks like licorice blitz has a
little bit of time time glitter in it
then you get a bronzer and blush this
one is in pink caramel and this one is
in lollipop it's a nice bright pink and
this looks like a pretty light bronzer
and then this these two are lip colors
this is raspberry truffle and bubblegum
and they are exactly what they say this
is a raspberry color this is a bubble
gum color go figure so that is the Too
Faced love sweet love palette then along
with that I'm also giving away to the
same winner the this to face blush brush
because these came together came with
some other stuff but I kept some stuff
and I'm giving some other stuff away at
another time so but these these did come
together so I'm going to be giving those
away together also from lorac from the
sale on hautelook I got the set of the
glitter glosses that they had and this
one is very very glittery I kept one of
them and I saved the rest for you away I
might take another one out of there
though I haven't decided yet and this
one is in cotton candy and it is I'm
telling you it is sparkly if you don't
like sparkly glitter you will not want
this one it's the sweet temptations
gloss and supposedly it does taste like
cotton candy ooh YUM that would be
delicious so one winner will be getting
that now these two things I've had for a
little while sitting in my box and I
would love to give them away this one I
got at Christmas time this is the bite
luminous lip palette and they are cream
lipsticks this trio of universally
wearable shades delivers exceptionally
smooth long-lasting color and moisture
rich coverage organic fruit butters
soften and nourish lips with every use
while antioxidant-rich preserver troll
fights free radicals and conditions
around the lip line so I thought these
were really really pretty and I did not
i will actually i'll open it for you i
have not
open this yet oh this is cute it's got a
little magnetic closure you open that up
pretty it's got a mirror very chic with
the black that's what's called rusty no
this one's called rose and this one's
called tannin and it looks like those
are all matte colors this may be a
little bit glossy but these don't look
glossy at all to me and it comes with a
little lip brush so that is the really
cute sleek bite lip palette that's
really neat I like that a lot so the
last winner is going to get in the Urban
Decay 24-7 waterproof liquid eyeliner in
her version and I really like this liner
this was my first high-end liquid liner
and I used it quite a bit i haven't used
it as much lately because i found that i
like a gel or a pen better but if you
love liquid liner this is a really nice
one it is a little tiny bit on the
watery side but it does stay on all day
makes a really nice nice black line very
black black black so the last winner
will be getting this so this is the
important part which is how to enter now
this is going to be similar to the six
winner giveaway that i did before if you
were subscribed then if you weren't i'm
gonna explain to you now i once had
someone win a giveaway and they
basically told me after they won that
they didn't really care about winning
and it was like sixty dollars worth of
products and I wasn't going to send it
to somebody that didn't want it so I
ended up telling her basically I wasn't
going to send it to her I was gonna send
it to somebody else and because she
didn't care she just let me get away
with that so I am practicing this by
saying please only answer for the items
that you really really want what you're
going to do is you are going to enter
one comment for each item that you want
so if you want the two-faced palette
you're going to put two faced as your
comment or two face palette as your
comment post then if you want to be lip
palette you're going to put lip palette
post if you want the lorac palette
you're going to put lorac palette post
if you want the lorac lipgloss you're
going to say lip gloss post and if you
want the eyeliner you're going to do
eyeliner post so you can put up 25 posts
5 comments in order to win each of the
items or to be entered at for each of
the items but if you don't like sparkly
lip gloss you're not going to enter for
this one because you don't like it so
you don't
want to win it that was someone that
really likes it really will get it don't
worry about things being marked as spam
if it gets marked as spam I will unspent
so don't stress out about that but I
will ask you to please only enter one
time per item that way everybody's
entered once it's nice and fair I will
be checking at the end I enter a copy
everything paste it into a word counter
so that I can see if anybody's entered
more than one time so please only enter
one time for each item if you want enter
for all 55 different posts if you want
to enter four to two different posts but
either way you'll be equally as likely
to win each item if that makes sense so
