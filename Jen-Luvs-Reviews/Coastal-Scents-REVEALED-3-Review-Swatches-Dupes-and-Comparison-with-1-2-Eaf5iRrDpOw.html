palette I got my snow day sweatshirt and
I got my chai tea I think we're ready
for some swaption
hello my friends welcome to my revealed
3 reveal so excited about this I was so
so thankful the Coastal Scents was kind
enough to send this to me for review I'm
actually going to be drinking tea
because it's cold outside right now and
I'm actually gonna be drinking real teen
on an empty cup ok it's not I'm not
faking this is just real tea in here
alright
I also got my snow day sweatshirt on
because we got a snow day tomorrow's
probably the last one of the year so I'm
just gonna make kind of chill and go
over this reveal through with you now
let me tell you what's gonna be in this
video basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna swatch this baby for you I'm also
gonna do a comparison with the revealed
one and the revealed to Palace tell you
if there's any dupes whether you whether
I think you need all three whether you
know how they compares for is color
selection I'm also going to tell you
some high-end dupes that I found in my
collection for some of the shades netted
more into the dupes and whether they're
true dupes and all the doopy stuff later
alright so it's coming out tomorrow so I
just wanted to get this to you today so
that you could know whether you want to
purchase it or not let me start with a
little bit of history so Coastal Scents
released the original revealed palette
to compete with the urban decay at least
in my opinion I think they did it I
don't know for sure but in my opinion I
think they released this original
revealed palette to compete with the
naked one and naked twos from Urban
Decay you can see there's lots of
neutral shades in there
they go very well with the kind of color
ranges found in The Naked 1 and Naked 2
now when the Naked 3 came out the
revealed 2 palette came out and this has
a lot of the pinky shades of The Naked 3
cable with naked 3 yeah the Naked 3 had
in the reveal too now and then the
revealed 3 came out Urban Decay hasn't
come out with a new palette so we've got
a lot of different kinds of colors in
here some of them are similar some of
them are different but it's a very
strange combination of colors let me
just go ahead and show you the swatch
alright so these are the first 5 shades
this is 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 this is 6
seven eight nine and ten moving on to
the second row with the Purple's this is
11 12 13 14 and 15
hey last ones this is 16 17 18 19 and 20
okay so here are some brush swatches
okay my left arm has no primer my right
arm has a primer so you can see that the
first two shades which can be located
here and here and here and here that
shades number one and two you cannot see
at all on my skintone like at all you
can see that with the primer over here
the shadows are slightly more pigmented
another thing you may notice as far as
the pigmentation is the purples are not
as super pigmented as I had hoped that
they would be if you look down at the
bottom down here by my wrists I mean
they're just not as impressive as I hope
they would be you can also see a few of
the other shades definitely fall short
on pigmentation equally as important
there are some really fantastic shades
that show up nice and bold and beautiful
so those are the swatches altogether and
again this was done with just a small
domed shader brush
I messed behind me but I just want to
show you my eyeshadow this is after 14
hours ish of wear right eye is primer
left eye is no primer you can tell I
definitely have equal amount of shadow
left on both sides actually I feel like
the one with the primer on it is
actually a little bit more creased and I
did use the urban decay on my arms I use
the urban decay regular primer potion on
my eyes I use the anti-aging which is
kind of ironic that I would have more
creasing on the anti-aging side versus
the no primer side very odd I can tell
you that I did not notice fall out
through the day for the shadows that I
use today I think I use three or four of
the shades in here for today okay so the
next question I want to answer is does
this palette how does it compare to the
other two if you have one of the other
ones do you need this one so let's talk
about revealed one like I mentioned
earlier revealed one the original one it
wasn't called reveal one who just called
revealed
was a comparison to the naked one naked
- as far as shades you've got all
neutrals there's no poppy colors there's
gray there's black there's browns shades
of brown that's what you got so when you
put these two next to each other I mean
there's just no comparison as far as
that they're completely different I mean
you do have a few neutral shades in this
one but there are no exact dupes between
these two palettes at all if you only
have this one and you like these shades
I would say you would be happy getting
both as far as having different colors
remember revealed to a lot of people
compare this to the naked 3 palette
which had a lot of rose gold colors in
them so if you look at these two you'll
notice that they're very disorganized
both of them they're extremely
disorganized I think for a new makeup
user I would not recommend these
palettes either one of them because I
feel like they're well especially the
thick the revealed three because a lot
of these shades do not go together as
far as color ranges I mean even ones
that are next to each other it's gonna
be hard to create looks if you're not
used to using a lot of eyeshadow try to
match these up I even had trouble this
morning trying to put some shades
shadows together and I was like oh
that's one really worked out so well
this color you don't really match so I
would not recommend this for beginners
in eyeshadow if you're not really good
at figure out what colors go together
this one is a little bit easier I think
there's less of a color range here but
if you like those poppy colors then
maybe you would like this one better
also this one has a lot of pink tones
rose gold tones this one has the purple
range down here and you've got some
bright poppy Pink's in here you know it
this really is for more color lovers
where this would be a little bit more
neutral so super neutral in the one
moving toward colors in the two poppy in
the three poppy colors in the three so
as far as dupes in within the palettes I
couldn't find any exact dupes there's a
couple of them this is then the revealed
to this let me just show the difference
between the reddish start deep Rick
reddish colors in both and I can tell
you that the one in the three is powdery
err but you can see that they're not
dupes the one in
three is considerably lighter than the
one in the two basically what I'm trying
to get across is that there are no color
dupes in any of these pallets at least
that I can see I haven't been able to
find any so yes you would get different
colors if you got all three now this is
the fun part okay I've never done a
dupes video before so go easy on me
alright ladies as far as finding these
dupes but I was able to find in my
higher-end collection some colors that
were very similar to the ones in here
let me roll this up I'm getting hot
girlfriend it is hot under these lights
so lorac mega Pro Merlot is down here
let me swatch that for you there is that
and then over here this is this one here
this is number nine see the powder enos
of it I know my nail polish is coming
off I mean you can see that there's
similar shades but the pigmentation
difference is significantly different
between the lorac and the revealed three
this one's got a little bit of the
reveal three has a little sparkle where
the mallow does not but the shade range
is similar Oman boobs
well not really but you know I'm trying
here girlfriend I'm trying okay next up
Urban Decay's tease from The Naked 2
palette and from revealed number 18
which is right here now this one is not
powdery this one is definitely a nice
creamy shadow it's one of the best
shadows in here and you can see all the
chunkies that came off on that one holy
moly let's get rid of the chunkies
alright so there's your reveal 3 and
then there is tease from Urban Decay ok
also from Naked - we're gonna swatch
busted which is one of my favorite
shades
here's that and then from reveal 3 we're
gonna do number 10 right here ok and
this one isn't quite as powdery but it's
still powdery girlfriends still powdery
there we go so there is busted and there
is from the Navy revealed 3 you can see
there there's a little bit of a
duochrome ish in this one that's not in
this one but they're pretty close I mean
as close as I've ever gotten to a dupe
for busted but it's them I mean it's not
an exact dupe somebody looking on your
eye from a distance from far away
nobody's gonna know the difference all
right next up steal it in the garden
okay and then this one we're gonna
swatch honey which is the Goldy kind of
shade down there my nail polish is so
chipped on that pointer fair
oh no y'all don't care we're friends I
got a chip nails you're my friends
number 17 which is this one here again
Powell Tory just got tapping off got to
tap it off now this one there's
definitely a difference in pigmentation
but I think the shade is pretty darn
close yeah the only difference is in
pigmentation and these are with no
primer so with primer maybe it will be
more pigmented but the original meet
matte palette we've got Matt Batali
which is this plummy color it's very
cute it's very cute it's very pigmented
and then for room vo3 we're gonna do
number 19 which is this one down here at
the bottom there you go mmm look at that
one
BAM it was a pretty doggone close pre
darling close and I think that's a
really that's a creamy one it's a tad
bit powdery from the reveal 3 but it's a
good one speaking of the bomb let's talk
about the Rockstar palettes so we're
gonna swatch allegro which is this like
warm brown almost like a muddy brown
like a dirt brown but it looks really
nice in the crease and we're going to
compare that with number 3 which is this
one here okay
so again that's a leg row and that's the
one from the revealed and you can see
the pigmentation is definitely different
as far as the bomb being a little bit
more pigmented but that's pretty darn
close and then finally I have a Kat Von
D do paying y'all know Kat Von D's one
of my faves overall except for that
terrible Christmas couch came out with
alright the S
Ranjha palette okay and South which is a
beautiful brow bone color for me which
is that one there and we're going to
compare that with the very first one
number one definite pigmentation
difference again revealed three a little
bit weaker and there's that and you
can't really see that as much on my skin
tone but nice inner corner highlight for
deeper skin tones nice brow bone color
for lighter skin tones okay so some
final thoughts on the reveal 3 palette
overall do I recommend this well it
depends on what your needs are if you
can work your shadows to the point where
you know how to match these colors
together definitely it's definitely more
for you if you have trouble matching
your eyeshadows and figuring out how
they're gonna get go together I don't
recommend this if you are worried about
fallout if you have trouble with fallout
with other eyeshadows I wouldn't
recommend this and there a lot of these
shadows are really really powdery you've
got to remember to top off that brush or
you will get product on you on your
cheeks it's gonna happen as far as those
of you that have one of the other reveal
palettes know that there are no dupes in
this one if I were to say the closest
ones would be the 1 to 2 and the 3 but
yes they are very different there's no
similarity I don't think between the 1
and the 3 I think I was most blown away
by the original reveal palette I think
the 2 is nice
I think the 3 is is nice too ok I really
bothers me that a lot of these shades
don't really match up that you have to
kind of be a color expert in order to
match these at least that's my opinion I
think it's kind of difficult to work
with as far as the selection and how
they're organized it's like almost like
they're like oh let's put some pinks in
oh let's put some neutrals in let's put
some purples in pool and let's just mix
them all everything all together and
it's just like a hot mess of an
organization in here and let let's throw
a couple of goals right in the center
I'll know what they were thinking on
that one but it's a decent palette it's
a decent palette it's a blow my mind I
know but it's a decent palette so that
