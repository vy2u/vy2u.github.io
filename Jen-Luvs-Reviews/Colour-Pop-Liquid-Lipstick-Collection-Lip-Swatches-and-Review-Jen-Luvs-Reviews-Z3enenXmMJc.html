pops in the air and wave them like I
just don't care hello my friends welcome
to my colour-pop liquid lipstick swatch
and review so there's a couple of
reasons why this exists number one
reason why this exists is because you
know that 20% off sale the color pop had
recently if you know this industry and
what's happening on YouTube and all that
you probably knew about the 20% sale it
was insane you had to actually wait in
line online to get in to the online
store and I think it took me about two
and a half hours of my computer being
open just sitting there waiting to get
into the online store so think of
dissipating this 20% often thing I mean
it was insane as absolutely insane so I
get my box and I'm so excited and I look
in the box and I was like all these
colors look the same and they look like
everything else I own like what was I
thinking but then the more that I've
tried these and more than put them on
they really are quite different so in
order to be helpful to you if you were
gravitated toward the same kinds of
colors that I've gravitated to which is
mostly like nudie pinks brownie nudes
like nudie nudie nudie kinds of colors I
don't know these are just the colors
that I like I very rarely will wear a
bright purple or a bright you know a
bright red things like that these are
the shades I gravitate towards so I
figured just to try to be helpful I
would do a little swatch vest for you
and show you what they all look like so
you can kind of decide what colors may
be right for you now keep in mind though
if you are a different skin tone to me
they may look quite different on you so
definitely keep that in mind and
definitely go to the colour-pop website
they have some great swatches over there
on different skin tones just so you know
you can also Google online too and find
them on different skin tone so anyway
the other reason why this video exists
is because there is a video that I
watched called I hate colored pop I will
link it down below it is such a funny
video it's really good and it's so true
about me I mean these are so inexpensive
I think they're like six dollars a piece
and I feel like I just have to keep
buying more I don't know why just waving
these around
McCullough pops in the air and wave them
like I just don't care like I just can't
stop waving them they just keep waving
but without further ado let's get into
the swatches I'll show you what those
they love this completely
like introducing us to taste the flavor
because I'm gonna take that it's only
nature
I live with danger
so those are the swatches of the
different liquid lipsticks and as you
can see even though they look quite
similar they are very different and it's
it's interesting to see because in the
tube like it hold them next to each
other I mean if I hold next to each
other you know Bianca and clueless they
look almost exactly the stinking same
one more thing I want to talk about is
the formula before I go basically my
personal experience with these is
they're drying they are very dry to put
on one thing you can do to help with the
dryness is to put a lip balm overtop but
you are going to compromise the wear
time if you do that but what you will
also be doing is you will be helping it
to wear down better because the deeper
the shade I found them worse if these
things wear down meaning that they start
cracking they start wearing off in weird
places it's kind of strange so that
using that lip balm helps it to wear
down a lot more evenly so that you can
get more use out of the color without
having to run to the bathroom every five
minutes and check your lipstick to make
sure you don't look freaky overall I do
really love colour-pop liquid lipsticks
as you can see because I own so many of
them because I've found a way to work
with them that works for me which is
adding on that lip balm it works for me
and I really like them a lot I know not
everybody likes them but I like them so
that's just me so thank you so much for
