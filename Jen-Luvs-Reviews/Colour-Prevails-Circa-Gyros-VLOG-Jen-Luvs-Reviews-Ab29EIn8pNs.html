want to see
we just left the toys r us store and I
just don't feel like having anybody else
tell me I'm not allowed to use my camera
in their store so we didn't feel while
we were there but we got the kids he's
really cool it's called the amazing
Dipper nude too and it's a boomerang
stone plane to get three of them in here
they're like little foam planes but the
guy was demoing them in the store and
they just look really cool they like fly
around in a circle like the way that
they're made they're really cool so I
young kids are gonna like yeah never be
really excited about so now we're going
to head to the M&amp;amp;M store and get them
some little mix bag a man's
and hey look it's 24 at Times Square can
see it it's over there
uh-huh I said we're not gonna go in
there we're not gonna go in there now
with Sephora yeah they're me for today
for today well there they were me I
can't judge all people that's very
touching that too much to portray might
not even need in there
I might be mentally there all right we
just wanted to show you tom sparky here
behind the crazy stuff going on big
buildings
very good
they just have they said they just got a
couple of products they didn't get the
whole line yet so a lot of it is empty
but you see they have the circa
foundations and then they have the
colorful veils lips lip products and
then they have these little this little
book that shows you what's going to be
in it and the line the beautiful nail
polish design and yeah just really
exciting to see what this line is all
about
the clift you oh these are cool looking
I know right
so I wish I could show you the whole
line but that's pretty much all we've
got so far at least at this one we read
it to another walgreens maybe we'll stop
by so this is the rest of where circa is
going to be displayed but there's
nothing there yet still working on it
basically this came in though we've got
some test results i'm going to swatch a
real quick these are the classic duos
and lip glosses so this one is called
this one policy unless this is called to
our fairy
feels it looks very moisturizing it's
nice and then let's show the other side
it's like it's got a nice color payoff
they're very nice very nice let's do a
bold one for y'all look like the bold
colors must watch em all but let's try
this one send us some you don't really
like these colors look at that he was
called iris iris yes thank you for
saying that because I didn't see that so
it's not super pigmented looks like it's
going to be a nice wash of color it's
not going to be one of those Super Bowl
paint kind of formulas and then let's
show you here yeah that one's just going
to be just an over gloss it's not super
pigmented
that's really cool try any testers me
okay so let's try this one this one is
called suede and this is the color
balance with the foundation
oh that's whoa oh my goodness yeah I
didn't I hardly put you put a lot on I
didn't realize I was putting on that
much just like actually was it my whole
hand la la la la let's just keep
painting but it looks like a pretty full
coverage like a medium to full coverage
foundation it's really nice I'm like
painting all Christian was that this is
the Circa know what number was this
number this one might know that's a to
even this is number to process one of
the lighter ones but it's a nice full
coverage and let's see this one is a
tester I don't want to open unless it's
a test or but I'm gonna put the tiny
little bit I totally just painted my
whole arm hands crazy but now I'm like
priming it's not coming out okay just
tiniest tiniest bit holy moly that's and
craziness
okay look how much I mean that's just
the tiniest little pump we get half your
face so it looks definitely like a
medium to full coverage foundation
that's exciting it's definitely not
drying down a nap though you're
definitely gonna need a powder with this
stuff but very cool i'm so glad i got to
try these that looks so ridiculous I
need something to wipe that off those
