chomping you're his second I got home
from walking my kids to the bus stop and
I saw my tears of beauty palette sitting
on my desk and I was like I want to play
with that like right now and then I
remembered reading on a website that
there was a user named what was her name
can't take this anymore something like
that I go to a chat course again their
username is sick of it all and she was
like Jen he spends all this time on
swatches she really should do like more
like wear test kind of stuff so I was
like cool man I got this I think this
would be cool so what we're gonna do is
I'm just gonna go ahead and put this on
just very informally and we're gonna do
a wear test today and I may even come
back and do this for a couple more days
because I think that would be a super
cool video so that sounds good to you
hang tight I'm getting started right now
so I just did a little quick you know
little quick notes on this real quick
this is the cheers of beauty pellets 56
dollars at the colored ringing website
it breaks down to 2 dollars and 66 cents
per gram so if you plan on using this
all the way hit and pan you're talking
about price per gram similar to like to
face it says it comes with five match
two foils five shimmer pearls and one
highlight Shane I don't know about that
I'm confused though because this is Matt
this is Matt this is Matt and this is
Matt but this one here definitely has
some sparkle in it this vintage feels
one so I don't I don't really get how
that's Matt it definitely has sparkle in
it and then there's two foils this is
definitely a foil and I'm thinking that
this one might be the other foil and
then there's five shimmer pearls which
would be one two three four five and
then one highlight shade I'm not gonna
use the highlight shade snakes only I'm
going to do the rest of my face I think
I'm just gonna do my eyes and just play
and have fun with you today
other things ingredient wise its talc
and dimethicone based preservatives
phenoxyethanol it does have carmine in
it which means that it's not vegan
but this is a cruelty-free brand there
are shades in here that are not lips
safe because of ferric ferrocyanide and
chromium oxide greens just be careful
tapping those over lips as stoppers just
because it's you know it's might not be
lip safe so you know just take a little
heads up there
so I'm gonna just take another bite
let's go ahead and rock this me alright
I'm just gonna start with the Urban
Decay primer potion and Eden I like to
start when I do start doing wear tests
for eyeshadows I like to start with
Urban Decay primer potion because I know
it's a very consistently good eye shadow
primer and I know that most eyes shadows
work very well with it I think I'm a
little surprised about about this is
that because this is a black comb beauty
brand I would expect some kind of deeper
transition shade some kind of dark brown
a black or something something that
would help to deepen up this raise the
glass shade and I don't see that so it's
quite surprised they didn't do that but
anybody can pull into any other palettes
but I was surprised that they did this
shade rather than like a deeper Brown
but we're gonna rock it we're gonna go
for this one I'm gonna try with not
setting the lid with any kind of matte
shade I might sometimes it works and
sometimes it actually doesn't look of it
at least from my experience I'm not a
makeup artist but a lot of times I find
I don't really like setting the primer I
don't know it just doesn't I feel like
it messes with the pigmentation of the
eyeshadow and I speaking of messing with
the pigmentation of the eyeshadow this
is insane I need to like calm it down a
notch because I forget I'm working with
coloring here this stuff is no joke this
is a Juvia space brush by the way they
have really nice brushes I'm just
slapping this on apparently because it's
like all over my lid and everything girl
calm it down color train says you can
use your fingertip that's preferred you
can also wet your brush and tap it into
the shadows I'm gonna use my fingertips
that's my preferred way of using shadows
and I think we're gonna do like a blue
and like this shade let's just do that
let's start with the blue let's do this
guy right here
it's so pretty
oh my gosh stuff is no joke what you're
going to the post office later people be
like what in the world is she doing I
might not even change out of the
sweatshirt to go to the post office with
my blue eyeshadow alright now I'm gonna
do this shade iconic that was called
opulence I'm gonna try to blend it
together in the middle a little bit get
a little blend action mmm I'm gonna take
a little bit of this black butterfly and
kind of smoke out the outer corner a
little bit I think this is the pro
crease brush by beauty junkies and I'm
just gonna tap the tiniest little bit
see that's working really well where I
was saying earlier that I felt like I
was working missing like a darker shade
but this is working really well for that
kind of try to finish this up a little
bit I like that that's really pretty
okay so now I'm gonna just make this
even crazier I'm gonna put a little bit
of Diamond Jubilee in my inner corner
I'm just gonna use this little C brush
but it's a smudger brush I guess they
call it by Moda from their prismatic
collection now one thing is this shade
actually came broken it had a little
crack going down the center but I just
patted my finger into it and it was fine
it's not really picking up very much on
the brush I probably should let it I
don't know that's doing fine thought I
would need to wet it but it's doing good
or well I should say it's doing well and
I would imagine if you want to just pop
this straight over top of a matte shade
that would be insanely beautiful like
just do like this matte cream with this
silver popped over it oh alright do a
little bit in the lower lash line mmm
let's do a little bit a black butterfly
on the outer corner
I might just leave it at that I think
that looks kind of cool like that
let's do lustrous bling the highlighter
on the inner corner I don't know if I
like that choice I don't think I like
that choice when we have to go with it
now because that's what I chose to do I
don't know I don't really like orange
tones on my on my lower leg because I
feel like it makes my eyes look like
I've been bleeding everywhere
it's like a peachy color I don't think I
like that but we're gonna we're gonna
keep going anyway because I don't feel
like taking it off so now I'm just gonna
go ahead and put on some mascara and
liner I'm not gonna do full lashes today
because I'm not filming any more videos
so I'm just gonna do that and I'll be
right back all right I got my liner and
the lashes on I did my brows I got some
lip gloss on just tell you what I did I
used the Too Faced chocolate brownies
for my brows I do really like this brow
pencil and it smells like chocolate
which always makes me happy
and then the NYX epic ink liner which is
amazing
mascara today is the essence lash
princess which is a cult classic and one
of my favorites and bareMinerals lip
gloss in fly is the shade on my lips and
just doing I'm not wearing any
foundation no concealer nothing like
that I'm just testing the eyes today so
the rest is just super basic it's
currently 9:45 in the morning so we'll
come back after lunch before I can pick
up the kids from the bus stop and we'll
check and see how this is wearing one
thing before I go that I thought was
really cool that I took a note on is
that the owner of coloured raine
Lorraine which i think is really cool
that it she spells coloured raine Rai ne
and that's the way her name is Belle
which I didn't notice before so that's
super neat she says I have a deep and
intense love for color
I believe makeup is a toy for grown-ups
to be able to express themselves and how
they feel and I feel like color green is
so that for me like I this is definitely
one of my favorite brands that I've been
into for this for 2017 so cheers to the
cheers of Beauty palette for good first
initial impressions of it I'm super
loving it but we'll see how it lasts of
the day I'll be back in a couple seconds
for you it's gonna be multiple hours for
me see in a second alright it has been 5
and 1/2 hour
since I put on this eyeshadow not a
whole lot has happened in my life I
ended up in a very long conversation
with my production manager about what's
up and makeup and changes we're gonna be
making in the new year that I'm super
excited about did end up making it to
the post office but everything's ready
to go for tomorrow so I'll just have to
bring it tomorrow no biggie
and I also edited a video not all the
way through but a lot of it of my worst
products I tried in 2017 which hopefully
you've already seen at this point so
let's go ahead and zoom in on my eyes
and let's talk about what we see so one
thing I want to let you know is I do
have a cold so I found myself pitching
my eyes my eyes are like super itchy
today for some reason so I itch the
inner corners of my eyes and the outer
corners of my eyes but I did not touch
my lids so my lid should be legit but
don't take anything here and here
seriously now I do have some glitter
fallout all down here I'm not sure if
that was from rubbing the corner whose
my corners of my eyes or not so we are
definitely gonna have to come back for
another wear test tomorrow I'm thinking
three days will be enough to give a good
solid impression of how these shadows
work but overall I feel like the lasting
power on these shadows is really good it
looks really great all over my lids
there is a little bit of patchiness
right here on this eye that I don't
believe was there before so that I don't
know what's going on with that why it
would be on one eye and not the other
maybe my application technique maybe my
finger went a little too far in the side
of my eye something like that I don't
know but this eye looks amazing all
right let me zoom you back out so what
we'll do is we'll check in again later
today and more into the evening and
we'll see how this looks I'm about to go
pick up my kids from the bus stop and
then we're gonna celebrate Yule with my
daughter and maybe that create the
Christmas tree
my husband has jujitsu tonight so we
have a limited window of time I got to
make dinner stuff like that I got to do
dishes I will see you after all of that
is done so that's gonna happen for you
right about now hello my friends it has
been a long and eventful day I went to
go get my kids from the bus stop and
then we went over to the drugstore to
get presents for their teachers because
I forgot to do that so we ran a couple
errands and then we came back and I
helped with homework and I made dinner
we messed up on Hanukkah
so we
still had a couple nights to celebrate
we just keep going until we run out of
candles basically my mother's family is
Jewish so I want to teach them that part
of their heritage so we do do the
menorah for Hanukkah and then we
decorated the Christmas tree and then we
celebrated Yule with my daughter who is
Wiccan so we celebrated three different
winter holidays today which was very
very busy and very eventful with it
anyway you're not here for that you are
here to find out the wear time on this
eyeshadow let's go ahead and zoom in I
left my phone downstairs
it's about 9:15 at night so let me go
ahead and zoom you in right now since
the last time I checked in on my eyes
haven't been as edgy I guess maybe
because I was so busy like running
around with a chick like a chicken with
its head cut off so I didn't rub my eyes
anymore but you can look on my eyes and
you can see there is some fading but
there's definitely still separation of
color I think it still looks really good
I'm still really happy with it I think
for almost 12 hours of wear time 11 and
a half hours my eye shadow still looks
pretty stinkin good I do have a lot of
Fallout on my cheeks like a lot so yeah
mental note about the fallout maybe one
of these times I'll use some two-faced
glitter glue or some NYX litter glue or
something to see if I can keep that
fallout from falling but overall I think
the look still looks great even the
matte shade that I used here that
reddish kind of shade what was that
it's called raise the raise a glass even
that shade is still there in the matte
shades though alright that's it for
today's wear test and I will see you
tomorrow for day 2 before I go for the
night I have a tragedy to share with you
I accidentally dropped my chairs of
beauty palette it fell off my chair here
and onto my carpet it did stay closed
but unfortunately one of the shades has
completely shattered everywhere it is no
longer in the pan I'm gonna try to scoop
it back into the pan as much as I can
now it was the one that I had mentioned
had come broken and I just kind of
pressed it back together so it clearly
has a lot of dimethicone in it
not enough binding agent it just it's
shattered everywhere so I'm gonna try to
fix it as best I can and I'll show you
tomorrow how it went that's a big bummer
though because that is a mess can you
see that without me tipping it over it's
pretty bad so I'm very sad but I'm gonna
try to fix it I'm gonna do my best
alright it's day 2 of testing the code
range cheers to beauty pallets I can
pick up my pallet now this is what it
looks like now that I have repressed as
much shadow as I could capture into the
pan and it is staying in there really
well at this point and I am still
getting you know the shadow out and it's
just not as fluffy as it was and I
actually got cold rain contacted me I
put an Instagram story up with an update
on my broken pallet and I'll tell you
what what they said so it was almost
immediate after I put the Instagram
story up ok so she says what's the order
number we'll send you a return label
once we've received we'll have a
replacement set and I asked if they
would reimburse me for shipping and she
says we're going to pay for the term
return you were honest enough to let us
know that there was a small crack in the
pallet upon receiving which there was in
that silver shadow she said the only
caveat is you won't be able to use the
rest we would need the pallet in its
current condition so I talked to her
about it a bit and I said you know well
I kind of need to finish my video before
I send it back you know I've got two
more wear tests to do and she says we
need it in its current condition or at
least it cannot be overly used then she
starts you know kind of like something
she's like okay feel free to wear test
it and then we'll be waiting for you to
send it back so we can replace it for
you and some little heart emojis so I
mean I'm not gonna be overly using it
I'm just using it two more times and
then I'll be sending it back to color to
bring in and to be honest with you if
she didn't if she didn't let me do that
then I was just going to keep the
palette the way that it is and not
accept the return because I can't afford
to wait another week to do this for the
for once
I'm gonna be early on getting a palette
review out and I wasn't willing to
sacrifice that to send it back I was
just gonna suck it up and deal with it
so what I did to clean it up in case
this does happen to you is I just put I
gathered as much as I could in the pan I
put the tiniest little bit of rubbing
alcohol in there
I think it was a 70% alcohol I put in
there I don't know if that's correct or
not but that's what I did and it worked
I also use the alcohol to try to clean
up some of the other shades there is
some of the silver and this luxurious
bling there's also some in opulence and
also in black butterflies so what we're
gonna do today is we're going to focus
on these shades over here on this side
so that we can stay away from the mess
that was over here as much as possible
and because this video is already
getting kind of long I'm not gonna do a
talk through demo this time I'm just
gonna do it with uh with the music in
the background and so we can kind of zip
through it and then get to the where
test so let's jump into that right now
all right that looks terrible I don't
know what I was thinking I'm gonna take
this off and we'll be right back all
right I've washed it off that was a
horrible looking and now that's just me
and my trying to be creative and it
failing miserably so let's try that
again ivory prime my eyes with a Mac
Paint Pot and let's go in again
alright this is not working either and I
really think I don't think this is the
pellets fault I think it's my ability to
use these shades apparently is not good
so let's do third time's the charm
I like this all over the lid let's do
this again
I'm running into a problem in that
there's no deeper shades to make the
smokier and I really want to make it
smokier no no I'll think while I do the
other eye I feel like I should be
playing for the Washington Redskins or
at least on their cheerleading squad or
something
I'm she's not digging on this I'm not
digging on the way it looks okay I'm
just gonna put a little bit of this
Nightingale in the outer corner I just
dipped into this one I forgot to show
you alright I guess I'm just gonna leave
it at that I don't want to ruin it I'm
scared that I don't have the skill level
and it's just gonna end up being a hot
mess so I'm just gonna let it be at this
point um do the lower lash line alright
I look as done I'm gonna go ahead and
put on liner and mascara and do my brows
and I'll be right back before I take
this part off I just want to show you
that there is fallout on my cheeks it
may have been I didn't tap my brush
enough it may have been that just this
palette is prone to some fallout so at
this point I would recommend definitely
using some shadow shields or doing your
foundation last I'm not gonna do
foundation today again just like
yesterday but I did want to show you the
fallout I'm gonna wipe it off right now
so that I can see whether the shadow is
falling from my eyes throughout the day
I want all this gone now so we can kind
of test that point
all right fallout is now fixed I did all
the same brows liner and mascara that I
did yesterday on my lips today is the
Juice Beauty what is this this is the
it's like a shiny lip gloss thing and
fig I don't know what the name of this
product is though I just grabbed it out
of the drawer it look kind of cute I
mourn it and while feels really good
it's kind of oily though but yes that's
what's gonna be on my face today now
that I've looked at it in like a bigger
mirror actually really like the look a
lot better than I did in the close-up
mirror like really trying to inspect it
like I like it better just kind of
looking at me
not like one thing I didn't do yesterday
that I want to do today is I want to
zoom in on my eyes now so you can see
what everything looks like freshly
applied not a makeup artist we're just
testing the wear time here so we're
gonna go ahead and wear this I did get a
later start today with doing makeup
because I was busy this morning so right
now it is currently 220 I'll be back
after I put the kids to bed tonight for
like an 8 hour wear test today I think
that would probably be best since it's
already kind of late I'm gonna go ahead
and go about my day and I'll be back in
two seconds for you it's gonna be lots
of hours for me so see you in a second
alright my friends it is now currently
10:30 9 in the evening I'm about to take
my makeup off go to bed a little bit
early I think it lasted pretty well
overall I mean for 8 hours I think it
looks great there's definitely some
patchiness happening on this eye but
overall I mean it still looks pretty
good I don't know there is a little bit
of fallout but it's not nearly as bad as
yesterday I think tomorrow I'll put
glitter glue on one eye and not the
other to see if that makes a difference
and then we're gonna try some different
shades but before we do that before we
say goodnight I want to go ahead and
zoom in on my eyes so you can see how
they look up close ok so let's go ahead
and close the eyes see how this one's a
little bit patchy over on the side just
a little bit but overall I mean it's
still extremely vibrant I mean the lower
lashline still looks great yeah I'm very
impressed I didn't have really an
opportunity with this look to have like
a muddying of color on the lid since
I've really just used the gold all over
the lid I mean I did use a little bit of
that darker gold on the outside but you
know they were kind of similar in shade
anyway so it's kind of hard to tell what
happened there I have a little tiny bit
of creasing if you look right here a
little bit of creasing up in the crease
but you know it's creasing up in the
crease I guess that just kind of happens
sometimes but yeah for eight hours
overall I think this looks pretty good
so
I'm gonna go ahead and hop to bed and I
will see you all in the morning
my love see you in about 30 seconds all
right we are on to the very last day of
testing the cheers of Beauty palette I
will be setting this back after today so
I've got to get this right I've got to
get a good wear test in because I don't
know how much patience they're gonna
have with me as far as getting this back
to them since it's getting close to that
14 day window and yeah they don't give
you a lot of time to send these back and
as a youtuber that's very difficult to
comply with it just a just be very
careful if you do decide to purchase
this because this one is really
extremely extremely fragile and you can
tell when you get it that it's just
different than the other shades that
it's just not pressed as hard and it's
very fluffy and that's the word that
coloured raine had used in our
communication is that it's very fluffy
and I agree so just please be careful
with this palette because I think that
it's gonna happen again with the new
palette unless I'm very very careful so
moving on I decided what I'm gonna do
today I am filming today so I want to do
a really nice look I'm gonna set up a
matte look just like a basic matte look
and then I'm gonna tap this shade all
over top of it and see if I can use it
kind of as a topper I think I've used
all of the shades in here so let's go
ahead and get into it
I'm not gonna talk through it again just
for times sake so so let's go ahead and
pop into it
okay so let me smite which is Devin
I literally just spent 20 25 minutes
trying to put these lashes on it's the
first time used these either Ardell faux
mink lashes and oh my gosh it was a
nightmare so when you look at the
close-up of my eyes just know I
understand my lashes are not placed
perfectly I get it
I don't have time to mess with them
anymore and they look good enough to me
so I'm letting it go but this is the
finished look with lashes and liner and
I think it came out pretty good I just
remembered I was meaning to do some
glitter glue today to see if I could
kind of prevent some of the fallout
completely forgot to do it
I will definitely update you in the
description box whenever I get this
palette back hopefully I will be able to
wear these at least one more time before
I send it back but I don't know if I
will be able to do that or not just
because I know that we're getting close
to that 14 day window so I apologize for
that and I will put any updates when I
am able to use glitter glue in the
description box below so overall I do
really like the look I think it came out
pretty good so now we're gonna go ahead
and see how it wears so I will be back
in a little while and is currently 236
so I will be back later after put the
kids to bed to show you the final sware
test and give you my final thoughts on
this palette alright my friends are you
ready for the final check-in so it is
currently 1112
in the evening so it has been a typical
work or school day for hours and my
shadow still looks really really really
good before I give you my final thoughts
I do want to quickly show you some
swatches of this palette I'm not gonna
do my typical walkthrough of them
because this video is long enough as it
is I'm just going to show you finger
swatches and brush swatches really
quickly
let's go ahead and talk about my final
thoughts about this palette I really
really like this it's very consistent to
the coloring quality that I'm used to
which is wonderful I do have the Queen
of Hearts palette I have some of their
singles they're all amazing my biggest
biggest thing of course is the Diamond
Jubilee and my lack of faith in it that
it is going to break again I really do
feel like it will what I will probably
do with the new palette is before it
even breaks just add you know two drops
of alcohol to it and just press it down
really well and then that way I can save
the product that's in there before it
breaks that's what I'm going to choose
to do because it really makes me nervous
so that is an option that you have if
you're you know if it comes that way to
just you know puts a put a little bit of
alcohol in it to kind of solidify it a
little bit more and you're more likely
to be able to save your eyeshadow I
think that that's a big big mess up in
this palette this this shade the fact
that it's so incredibly fragile I I
don't think there's any reason for that
I mean from what I've heard from
different makeup companies they do
something called a drop test and you
know they just drop the palette on
different surfaces and see what breaks I
dropped the palette from a little lower
than waist high onto a carpet so I've
dropped so many palettes from that
distance and I've never had a problem
with his shadow breaking so just be
aware of that other than that these
shadows are phenomenal I mean the mattes
are amazing they're creamy they're
pigmented but they're not overly
pigmented they're very easy to work with
you only need the tiniest little bit on
your brush there isn't a lot of powder
kick up with the matte shades which is
super nice there isn't a lot of powder
kick up with the shimmer shades or the
foiled shades either I mean it's just a
beautiful beautiful palette and the
formula is fantastic other than the one
shade it's really really wonderful and
