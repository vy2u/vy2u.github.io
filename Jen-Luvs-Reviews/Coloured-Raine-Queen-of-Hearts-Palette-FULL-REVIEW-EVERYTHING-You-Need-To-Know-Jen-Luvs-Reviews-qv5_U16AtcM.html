review of the coloured raine
queen-of-hearts palette
I'm so happy to bring you some indie
brands for my full reviews I don't know
about you but some of these bigger
brands I feel like are kind of coming
out with the same things over and over
again just different packaging so it's
great to be able to review some anti
brands that have some innovative
interesting ideas so coloured raine is a
brand that I have been very interested
in for a while but I've never splurged
to buy anything from them
thankfully my friend and Nancy who sends
me things occasionally was kind enough
to purchase this for me it showed up in
my mailbox I was like yes so excited
about this so Thank You Nancy for the
gift I really appreciate it and now I'm
going to review it thanks to hers let's
talk about what you get in this palette
it is fifty dollars you can get it at
the coloured raine website there are
also some stores in New York and Florida
and one in Manchester England where you
can purchase these if you go to their
website they have a link of all of the
locations where you can purchase them I
know that mine was purchased at color
brain calm in this palette you do get a
mirror it is goes most of the way across
there's about an inch on either side
here about half an inch on the top or
bottom you get six matte shades and six
they shimmer or they call them foiled
shadows that's the word that they use
they are mixed through the palette it's
not like you have the mattes on one side
the shimmers on the other or the foils I
should say on the other the names of the
shadows are very royal so we've got
Crown Royal Highness Your Majesty
princess Empress Queen Mother and it
goes on and on like that each pan has
one and a half grams of product in it
which is a good size for an eyeshadow
pan typically I like to see eyeshadow
pans about one gram any more than that
is bonus it is a cardboard packaging it
does have a magnetic closure here on the
back is a sticker that says coloured
raine and all of the ingredients there
and some specifics to the product so
talking about that it is
made in the USA it is a cruelty free
product by the way but it is not fully
vegan it's mostly thing and there's
actually just one shade in here that is
not vegan and that's the shade ladyship
it does have carmine in it but other
than that this is a vegan product again
it's made and distributed from the
United States of America like I
mentioned earlier there's one and a half
grams of product in each pan leading us
to 18 grams of product total here it is
a $50 pallet so therefore it is two
dollars and seventy seven cents per gram
which is very reasonable for a Sephora
brand Ulta prestige brand product so
it's comparable to those it's comparable
in value to let's say the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette it's a little less
expensive in price per gram than the
Urban Decay Naked palette so now that
we've gone into a little bit about this
product I know you're excited to see
swatches so let's go ahead and get into
those now alright so here is the outer
packaging of the Queen of Hearts palette
I wish it was a little more exciting on
the outside but that's okay
it's great on the inside so look at all
those pretty colors now I did have to
refill these swatches because the first
time I did the swatches they did not
come out so good so you'll see different
nail polish kind of flipping back and
forth for the reshoot let's talk about
these finger swatches they look really
good on those first two shades crown and
royal highness they look a little less
impressive for air and royal prerogative
so ivory dipped in and did air and royal
prerogative again so you could get a
better representation of what these look
like when you pat them onto your lids
with your fingertips now with Crown I
know goes out of focus there for a
second but it'll come back it does have
an iridescent to this I don't know if
it's showing up very well but there is
an iridescent in there
I feel like royal highness is not
swatching with a brush the way that it
can go on the eye you'll see that in the
demo how it goes on the eye royal
highness it's a very very nice shade
these two with brush swatches come out
beautifully err and royal prerogative
and that's exactly how easy they are to
work with they're just beautiful
beautiful shades looking at this as a
quad you see that these are kind of your
more natural looking shades the ones
that are closer to skin tones and it's
just beautiful to have these in here
because it helps you to really give kind
of a base for your look so when you go
in to play with those colors
you aren't overloaded with color going
into what I call the second quad we have
Your Majesty princess noblewoman and
ladyship your majesty and princess and
noblewoman finger swatch great ladyship
swatches like doodoo absolute doodoo
it's horrible the way that it swatches
but again in the demo you'll see it
applies much better to the eye than it
swatches now going into the brush
swatches you'll see how beautiful your
majesty is it does take a little bit of
building up at a definitely brush swatch
is much better than royal highness
princess is just as gorgeous as air and
real prerogative just oh it's so pretty
makes me so happy a noblewoman isn't
quite as chunky as royal highness and
your majesty but it doesn't brush swatch
very well at all
it does look quite a bit patchy and
you'll see with ladyship ya brush watch
horrible
looks like doodoo but applying to the
eye I'm telling you it is not as bad
it's definitely my least favorite shade
in the palette but it still is
functional I don't want you to think
just because these swatches look like
doodoo but it's not functional it really
really is and you can get a beautiful
look using it going into the fourth quad
I don't think these were meant to be
used together I'm calling them quads
because I like to swatch things in fours
and this was the easiest way to make
them into fours empress is this
beautiful burnt orange shade and I
really like it a lot I don't have a
burnt orange it looks quite like this
it's really orange and it's just it's a
fun color to work with Queen Mother is
another one that swatches pretty badly
with a brush but overall on the eye it
does look really nice similar to some of
the other shimmery shadows I don't know
why that's a lot of focus sorry about
that
going into Duchess Duchess brush
swatches beautifully just like the other
mattes in this palette and then going in
to dethrone again not as beautiful of a
swatch with a brush but it does really
look nice on the eyes looking at these
all together these are kind of the fun
shades they're going to help you deepen
up your look Queen Mother dethrone and
Duchess are going to help you to really
create that deeper dimension where when
you're looking at your majesty
noblewoman princess ladies
and Empress those are the ones they're
going to add your pops of color and
really give you some very looks in here
you can go into like the warm orange e
your majesty and Empress look or you can
go into the purples with noblewoman
ladyship and queen mother or you can do
a mix of both now this is back by
popular demand we wipe test to see what
happens when you over blend these
shadows and will the shadows stay around
for a while now looking at the first
quad the Crown Royal Highness Aran royal
prerogative and see royal prerogative
hangs out the longest and it's not too
bad it's not too bad and then the second
ones that i swatched Your Majesty
princess noblewoman and ladyship those
definitely hang around a lot longer and
see if you over blend them they're still
going to be around and look how ladyship
how much that's still there even though
it's watched really badly
it definitely hangs around a long time
and in that base of those other shades
you do have a lot of brown which is
surprising going into the very last ones
that i swatched and wipe that off and
you can see the pigmentation is so very
much there on these last four shades I
mean you're it's not going anywhere and
that just tells me that when I use these
shades they're not going to blend into
the other colors also they tend to hold
on to their base color except for Queen
Mother turns a little bit gray now that
you've seen the swatches let's go ahead
and get into the demonstration of how
these products apply to the eye I'm
going to show you how I got this look
today
see to write about is fastened miles
apply the cars I'm passing can help but
wonder what I'm the Ben can help ask
what I believe in turbulence making me
nervous
this distance do I deserve this I'm
rather diverse a good fine you'll catch
me in enough
cuz when I am up this side
and when I
I tried to find
where I stand no song
that's not all
I'm not scared of
and I
and two players
like it's time I got nothing left all my
baggage behind I change the same my
conscience is clean I got no more need
to rewind the coaches where I have no
fear even from this ayah by home
cuz when I so now at this point you may
be sold one way or another for this
palette but I do want to mention some
things in the ingredient analysis that I
found when I looked at the ingredients
in the color drain palette now I have to
tell you when I looked at the ingredient
deck on this I was very impressed with
the cleanliness of the products meaning
of not a lot of them turned up as red
flags on Environmental Working Group
dot-org which is where I do my
ingredient analysis check so the first
one that does show up only in the matte
shades is talc talc I've talked about in
every single one of these ingredient
analysis you're probably tired of me
hearing about it so I'll just do very
quickly links are down in the
description for talc if you want to
learn more about it it can be an
irritant for some people there's also
some data gap concerns there is a bill
in place to possibly look further into
talc and whether it is a carcinogen for
us or whether it's harmful in any way
but that legislation has not gone
through yet so we'll keep you posted on
that one the next one is phenoxyethanol
which is a preservative that I talked
about again in every single one of these
ingredient analysis analyses analyses
and it is a preservative they use it
instead of parabens but it is also an
irritant to some people it is classified
as being toxic or harmful for products
around the mouth by the European Union
but Canada says that it is not toxic or
harmful so take that for what you will
whether you want to try putting these on
your lips or not I will tell you should
not put the matte shades on your lips
and the reason why is because they do
contain yellow v Lake and also
ultramarines which are ones that are we
are told not to put on our lips but
that's only the matte shades I don't
know if the foiled shades are lip safe
if I find out that information from
coloured raine I will put it in the
description down below I will try to
find that out for you so now let's go
ahead and get into my full review of
this product let me tell you this is
going to be a very positive review I
really have enjoyed working with this
palette one thing I love about this is
the separation of color when it goes on
the
a lot of the pellets I've been working
with lately have just gone to straight
mud on my lids they're very difficult to
work with
they blend out two weird shades were
they they just kind of mushed together
into one color I did not find that with
this palette I did use this palette on
its own quite a few times I also used it
mixed with some other shadows and man
did this thing perform well as far as
lasting power and separation of color
like just amazing really really really
good I was also very impressed with the
foiled shades how they applied with a
brush the first time I ever saw this
kind of formula was in the Jeffrey star
beauty killer palette the gold shade
that's in there and I did not find that
that applied well with a brush but it
did apply very well with the finger tips
I do think that these do apply a little
bit better with the finger tips but
they're still workable with the brush of
you're trying to get you know very very
small areas of your eye with these
you'll still be able to do that with a
brush foot brush which is fantastic but
if you are packing it all over the lids
you may wanna consider using a finger
tip you can also use a sponge tip
applicator which can help with
increasing the pigmentation in small
areas so that is with the foiled shades
now with the matte shades I feel like
they just apply beautifully I have no
complaints about these matte shades they
just are gorgeous they work so well and
the color selection in here is really
really good as far as how they have
distributed the deep shades middle
shades and light shades my only
complaint would be I wish if they
included at least one more lighter shade
and that's just me being selfish being a
lighter skinned person I wish that there
was a lighter shade than air and
princess that I could use for a brow
bone shade I just kind of feel like this
palette wasn't really developed for my
skin tone and and I'm cool with that
because there are plenty of pallets that
are developed for my skin tone I feel
like honestly if I have to recommend
this to anyone I would recommend it to
someone that is deeper than me I am a
light medium so anybody medium to deep
is going to love this the most but I
would also recommend it to people my my
shade and later as well because you can
always bring in like I did with the
Anastasia contour kit you can always
bring in that one brow bone
for blending if you really need it but
just know that this is not going to be a
standalone palette at least for me for
my light medium skin tone I do have to
reach in another palette for that balm
that blending brow bone shape one thing
I also noticed about the foiled shadows
that I did want to mention is you have
to be really careful not to dig your
brush in these they're very soft they're
dead metha cone base they're very very
soft and you can really dig up too much
product if you're not careful if you
notice in the demo I'm not sure if it'll
show up on camera but I did have some
fallout and I think that was due to me
digging too hard into the shadows I was
just getting a sighted okay got a little
excited and I got a little overzealous
with the brush pushed a little too hard
so just be aware of that if you do get
this but it's honestly it's a fantastic
palette I haven't been this impressed
with a palette since the Julius place
palettes since the Anasazi of modern
renaissance palette I mean I feel like
those have been the Knockouts
stellar palettes the Kat Von D metal
matte palette I was really impressed
with it's been a while since I've loved
appellant and I feel like the shades in
here have some uniqueness to them it's
not like anything else I have in my
collection the foiled shades are fun and
it's just fun to work with I don't know
if I would recommend this for a beginner
though unless you are of that medium to
deeper skin to them then you'll probably
be able to work with it as a beginner
but if you're lighter it may be a little
bit more difficult as far as the shade
selection like cool tones you probably
won't like this if you like warm tones
which are very very popular now you will
probably absolutely love this so that is
it from my review of the coloured raine
queen-of-hearts palette I hope you
enjoyed it if you did definitely make
sure you share with a friend we think
I'll also enjoy the video hit the
subscribe button if you're not already
subscribed and that thumbs up button
that makes me look super cool in the
YouTube algorithms so definitely leave
your thoughts and comments down below as
well if you would like I'm always loving
to read what you have to say about the
videos about the palettes in general if
you own it I'd love to hear what you
thought of it and I want to thank you so
so much for watching mad love and I'll
see you soon
