of these recent videos of first
impressions and I am so excited to do
this one because I have been looking at
the sting of mascara forever because you
know you're supposed to throw mascaras
away for every three months I stretched
it to four because I happen to really
like the the balm mascara that I had
gotten in when I might I think it was my
Ipsy bag I forgot what it's called I'll
put the name there I don't remember but
that mascara that by the balm I really
really liked and I didn't want to throw
it away I was also absolutely loving my
benefit they're real mascara dying over
that and just in time for me to break
into new mascara on Sephora calm they
had the new Dior show / curl mascara
sample that wasn't even out in stores I
don't know if it is now but they had
this full 100 Sephora points and of
course I had those because I'm a makeup
addict and I had that so excited this is
my first absolute first your product and
I've heard nothing but good things about
George your show all that good stuff but
it's so ridiculously expensive I
probably not buy it
I bought this Alma get up and grow
mascara or a really really long time ago
I heard it was phenomenal I think it was
Emily Noel who of course is like the
YouTube goddess of makeup reviews this
here was one of her recommendations of a
fantastic drugstore mascara so what I'm
going to be doing today is I am going to
be comparing these two for you so you
can see the difference and whether
there's a difference between Dior and
almay I think the full price of this one
is like $30 something like that
something crazy so here we go I get to
open but you do mascara I hope this is
this fabulous mm-hmm so it's got the
nice curled wand Isaiah
so there is the Diorshow
let's go ahead and open up obey or this
is a totally different want big fatty
wines
Wow
this is sick this is sick I did not
expect this I really thought that I was
gonna say that I love the do our show
more I like the alma mater at least at
this point at least from initial first
impressions I feel like my length my my
eyelashes are more full and I feel like
they're longer on this side am I crazy
or what
tell me in the comments I'm not crazy or
my lash is better on the side like
you've got to tell me I'm gonna close my
eyes and say I'm gonna try to put a
little more Dior on and see if that
makes a difference I'm gonna I'm gonna
try come on do your you're supposed to
be amazing I'm gonna even put my mirror
up okay so to make it fair
let's go in and do the Elm a one more
time seriously I was not expecting this
look check it out remember this is stee
or this is Alma
do you see a difference like I think
this one looks I think they looked
equally as lengthening but I think this
one I think the Alan a is more
volumizing I really do I'm shocked like
seriously I am so shocked I did not
expect that so um big win for Alma on
this and Dewar I was expecting more from
you Dior mr. Christian if you've tried
either one of these mascaras what do you
think let me know in the comments um I'm
completely speechless okay we gotta get
the husband final opinion cuz he's
completely unbiased he does not know
which eye has what won it all right my
love do you see any difference in my
eyelashes I really can tell the
difference it's just crazy I don't know
which one is which I mean at first I
thought this one looked a little fuller
uh-huh but really I mean they they both
look really similar yeah this is the
Alma so not enough to spend an extra $20
on a mascara okay
unbiased opinion has been given final
verdict alright I hope you enjoyed that
