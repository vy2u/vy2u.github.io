additional questions about the urban
decay and Revlon foundations and the
biggest biggest question was doesn't
last all day so I decided that first
thing in the morning I was going to put
thus exact same makeup on so I've got
the Revlon on this side Urban Decay on
this side and also since then you've
seen a video of mascaras you've seen the
curling mascara the Dior curling mascara
and the Alma mascara so I decided to put
those on to you want to go play all
right okay so I've got the Revlon on
this side Urban Decay on this side I've
got the Elm a mascara on this side I've
got the dr new curling mascara on this
side so I'm going to wear this all day
we're going to come back at the end of
the day and we're gonna see how
everything looks so thank you for
telling me you wanted more information
so now you're going to get it we'll see
what happens have a great day i'll see
you in about two seconds which will be
many hours for me all right hello my
friends for you it was only a few
seconds for me it's been about nine
hours since i put my foundation on it is
now evening time we're about to start
dinner and this is kind of what my
foundation looks like just quick
reminder this was the Revlon over here
just is wind blowing this is the early k
on this side so I don't know what it
looks like you probably know at this
point better than I do just because I
haven't been able to look at the camera
in the light like this my buddy it is a
little cold out isn't it so i will look
at the tape and then we will discuss
actually you know what why don't you
just discuss in the comments what do you
guys think can you tell the difference I
mean it is a very low coverage
foundations and I don't need a lot of
coverage so maybe I'm not the best
person to test this I don't know but I
mean if you've got normal skin this is
what it does for me
Oh bad love and I will see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
