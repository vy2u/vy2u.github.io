first impressions product review for you
and I am so excited about this because I
wanted to know personally whether what
would happen with this so I decided to
just do it myself which foundation I
like better the nearly naked new Revlon
foundation or the Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation now I kind of cheated a
little bit I went to Sephora and I got a
sample of the Urban Decay foundation
because this stuff is $39 and I am NOT
buying a foundation this $39 unless I
know that it is good I know I can return
it but I don't want to go through all
that I want to test it first
and because Sephora does that I decided
to do that so I will be testing this
today so here are kind of the claims of
both foundation The Naked Skin
Foundation claims it's a new light as
air foundation that has buildable
coverage but it feels like you're
wearing nothing it blurs in for
imperfections has a demi matte finish
that feels invisible anti-wrinkle stuff
lifting peptides green tea vitamin E
sodium hydro attracts water for optimal
hydration and circulation I mean all
kinds of stuff going on with this naked
skins though I guess that's why it's $39
it doesn't look like this one has an SPF
okay so for the Revlon nearly naked this
is what it says it says it's a
breakthrough nearly naked makeup
balances skin and makeup so they work in
perfect harmony who writes this stuff
buildable coverage and seamless blending
cover flaws and protect your skin's tone
and texture no cakey or greasy mess
it also has SPF 20 in it so we'll see
what happens I have the color in the
Revlon nearly naked of 1:30 shell and
then my naked skin that I got is in
shade 3 which i think is a light golden
which I wouldn't have picked for myself
but it seems to work so they must know
better
what color I wear alright um so here we
go
I have primed my face and I have put
concealer under my eyes because that's
what I would normally do before I do my
foundation so I'm going to put the
Revlon on the side the Urban Decay on
the side and then I'm going to blend it
with my Real Techniques expert face
brush
look about the same on both sides put a
little more in the urban decay so
I kind of wiped that off a little bit
try to get the the redline off the brush
before I go into the naked skin now I'm
going to go look closely here and see
what I think
looks like the nearly naked
it looks like the nearly naked has a
little bit more coverage than the Revlon
naked skin the Urban Decay I can feel a
little bit heavier and then I can feel
the Revlon the urban decay I think does
have a little bit more coverage than the
Revlon but I don't think anybody but me
would notice the difference between the
two sides to be completely honest I
think my face is equally as matte on
both sides you guys can tell me to all
zoom in whether you think you can see
difference between either side I can't
tell
they look this thing it seemed to me
they both look nice to me I like them
both
hey baby can I get your expert opinion
alright calling in the husband for the
second opinion right now I'm thinking I
can't tell the difference between the
two sides
can you tell any difference between the
two sides of my face my love no rather
than just rather than just the
lightening like just the way that we
have the lighting set up it's a little
brighter on the one side but your face
looks super even especially in the
monitor okay so the verdict is from the
husband both sides are accepting the
same $10 $40 $10 $40 I don't know I
think I'm gonna go with $10 this is $10
that's $40 I would go with the $10 yeah
I don't think there's a big enough
difference to justify $30 difference
plus I really honestly can feel the
Urban Decay more like I don't know I
don't think that I would feel it if I
didn't have both of them on.i love me
some Urban Decay I do but not enough to
spend extra $30 on something that really
is pretty much it seems like it's
exactly the same thing so that is my
first impression for the differences and
similarities between Revlon's nearly
naked and the Urban Decay Naked skin I
