of everything tag now I don't usually do
tags like this but my Q&amp;amp;A videos you
guys seem to really like those so I want
to do one of these every once in a while
just to kind of tell you a little bit
more about myself give up some little
secrets about myself tell you a little
bit kind of delve into Who I am so that
you know who you're watching I saw this
tag on Cristen games channel she is a
friend of mine on YouTube who I
absolutely adore and I absolutely loved
her version of it so I decided I was
going to do it as well she did not tag
me but that's okay I know she would have
tagged me if she could have tagged all
of her friends I'm sure she would have
but that would have taken forever
because Kristen has a lot of friends on
YouTube there's all kinds of questions I
don't think they're mote they're mostly
not Beauty related they're more like
just personal kinds of things so let's
go ahead and get started so number one
is do you keep up with the Kardashians
and the answer is no I don't keep up
with the Kardashians I could care less
about the Kardashians unless they're
telling me about makeup I don't care her
I did I'm not really into pop culture
like that I you know when now that
there's all these Kylie Jenner lip
trends and all this stuff now I care a
little bit but other than that I don't
care if you could have an old muscle car
which one would you choose I wouldn't I
don't care it's not my thing cars aren't
my thing number three do you curse like
a sailor when the camera isn't rolling
no I don't curse like a sailor I do
curse but I don't even usually curse
like a sailor unless I'm mad and then I
then they start rolling my husband John
says the DC comes out in me my head
starts going like this like oh no oh oh
it goes when I'm mad it starts number
four if your significant other gave you
one looking at the questions over here
if your significant other gave you a
Hall Pass
who would you use it on be honest and my
husband is actually sitting behind me so
it's a little embarrassing that I'm
actually going to answer this question
in front of him because I'm sure he's
listening at this point especially now
that I'm talking about him are you
listening baby he said okay so right now
I have a current obsession with the show
Supernatural so I would say
not the actors because I don't know
anything about them and they could be
complete toolboxes so I don't want to
say the actors but the characters I'm
super natural I would take either one of
them they're pretty awesome they're
they're pretty good-looking dudes
they're yeah especially Dean which one
would you choose if you watch
Supernatural which one would you pick I
can't pick they're both cute
oh hi Naomi all right now I will move on
for that because this is a little
awkward what is one thing you do that
you hate to admit and I will admit this
to you one of the things that I do that
I hate to admit is that I touch up all
of my thumbnails when you see my
thumbnails in my videos I erase my
wrinkles off of my forehead sometimes my
undereyes I'll brighten things up
sometimes I add extra hair I'm going to
show you a little clip of a before and
after picture of a thumbnail that I did
where I did some editing see if you can
see the differences
it's like spot the difference what did
Jen edit in this video and this
thumbnail so I edit my thumbnail so that
I look a little bit better than I do in
real life so yeah I hate to admit it but
I do it
do you really brush your teeth in the
morning and at night be honest no I
don't don't tell my children because I
tell them that I do brush my teeth at
night after they go to bed but most of
the time I don't I do brush them every
morning I make sure Burson every morning
but a lot of times at night I don't
brush my teeth before bed sometimes I do
if I'm feeling a little extra funky or
extra garlicky I will brush my teeth but
sometimes I don't but I have fantastic
dentist checkups so that's how I justify
it I know you think I'm gross now your
unsubscribing I get it and that's okay
I'm fine with that if you don't like me
for who I am and that's okay what is
your go-to drink at Starbucks usually
white chocolate raspberry mocha so they
do the mark regular white chocolate
mocha and then they add a pump a
raspberry and it's amazing is your
current hair color your real hair color
it's as close as it can get I mean this
this is very close to my natural hair
color but no it's not if you could swap
bodies with someone who would it be and
why all right I would only swap bodies
if I could swap back and you know how I
would swap with I would swap with Miley
Cyrus I would swap with Miley Cyrus I
know
stay with me here stay with me here I
would swap for one reason and the reason
why is I saw Madonna go through the same
thing that she's going through where
she's be
all wild crazy Madonna did the cone
boobs and all that stuff and she's gone
a while and crazy with the bud and the
shakin and all that and I would like to
bring her out of that and bring her to
the next level of maturity and get her
out of that and be her and be you know
done with that business and then I would
go back into my body after I've like
convinced her to stop have you read
Fifty Shades of Grey no I haven't read
it I have no interest in reading it it's
not it's not my cup of tea do you crack
your knuckles no it grosses me out to no
end and when Kristen game says she
cracks her knuckles I was like oh you
are so nasty girlfriend you a nasty oh
that's so gross I think it's one of
those things a lot of people do when
like private you know they don't really
do that in public thank goodness because
I just cracking bones just grosses me
out all right number 12 have you
accidentally text message someone to
something you were supposed to be
sending to us your special someone yes
you know what I did when I go to the gym
there's like a little body fit test
thing where you can like test your body
fat and like it tells you like your
whole makeup like your left arm your
right arm on how much fat you have
everywhere and I meant to text it to my
husband to show my progress and I
accidentally texted it to the thread of
co-workers when I need to when I need to
talk to my coworkers we have like this
little thread and they were the last
people that I texted and I accidentally
texted it to them and they were like
what is this I'm like nevermind delete
delete delete abort mission abort
mission don't look at that just delete
it
oops so wasn't anything naughty or dirty
it was just my body fat could i text it
to all of my co-workers mm-hm
embarrassing have you ever created a
fake profile to creep on someone no I
haven't but I did create a fake profile
on guru gossiper that website where they
talk about all the beauty gurus and they
like talk trash I created a fake profile
on there and then I forgot what the
email address was and everything so that
I just created a real profile and I do
like sneak on there and try to check and
see if anybody's talked about me on
there because I'm just curious and
I don't really look at other people's
stuff I just want to see if anybody's
talking smack about me I know it's
terrible I just I just I have to know I
have to know because in deal alone
they're gonna be honest and I want to
know honestly what people think of my
videos and people think they're crap I
want to know why they think they're crap
so that I can improve so that's I've
done that which is your weakness cookies
or pastries cookies no doubt cookies
what do you love about yourself I
actually you probably won't be surprised
by this but I actually really like
myself a lie I didn't like myself for a
really long time it took me a long time
to like myself I went through a lot of
not liking myself time probably until I
met John really when it comes down to it
I don't know probably right before I met
John I started really liking myself
maybe about six months to a year before
I met John but I like I like that I feel
like I'm a genuinely good person you
know that I I really try to treat other
people the way I'd like to be treated
and I feel like that's something that's
really important in people and I value
that about myself that I feel like I'm
overall just good to people and I feel
like that comes back to me too that I
feel like people are good to me because
I'm good to them you know what I'm
saying
a little more lighthearted do you have
your have to match your nail polish to
your toe polish no never I never do
never because I'm constantly changing my
nail polish I tell you my nail polish
probably every two to three days maybe
four days I'll change my nail polish I
changed my toes like twice a season I
don't care about my toes I never look at
my toes I look at my nails all the time
so no they don't ever match a few things
people would be surprised to know about
you thanks you will be surprised knew
about me number one you may have seen my
dinosaur sweatshirt that I own and I
love dinosaurs
I think dinosaurs are awesome I love
anything that is old or historic like
really old like dinosaur old I've got a
little fossil collection I've got a rock
collection
I love rocks and stones and stuff all
the medical physical stuff with crystals
and all that I don't know if I believe
in it a hundred percent but it's really
fun to believe in it so I do a lot of
times I'll carry rocks in my pocket for
different metaphysical purposes which is
kind of odd I think for
some people to hear but I just think
that it's fun does it work I don't know
it probably doesn't but it's fun I I
have like heat I've like piles of rocks
let me show you my rock okay so this is
where I keep a lot of my rocks in this
like birdbath thing I got it from a
little black bag when a little black bag
existed on missiles like that but I mean
I've got like all kinds of different
rocks and stones and they all have
different metaphysical purposes and
stuff and just all kinds of different
rocks a little Dalmatian Jasper in there
and I love bracelets that are made out
of real stones so I have quite a few of
those just rocks and rocks and more
rocks this whole bottom of this thing is
all filled with different rocks I know
it's weird that's why I'm sharing with
you because you're like my friends so I
want to share this stuff with you oh and
like I've got like pieces of rock like
this like this big piece of amethyst
that I love it's just like a piece of a
geode I've got these two giant pieces of
rock that John bought me at like
HomeGoods or something like he sees
these pieces of rock and just buys them
for me because he knows how much I love
them okay and I got one more weird thing
that I want to show you I gotta get it
for you so if I'm not painting my nails
late at night I like to build with nano
Legos I know I'm like revealing
everything in this video like this is my
headless Statue of Liberty because my
children are actually building it with
me so we've been waiting to put the head
on and we just haven't built the head
that's all that's left is the head and
we just haven't built it yet and I can't
do without them because they'd be mad at
me so we'll leave a headless statue of
liberty over there and then this is
Easter Island I've only built the one
little guy but I love building with
these things they're just so fun so I've
got like a little collection of them at
work my students love them I've got the
Eiffel Tower and I've got the Empire
State Building and I've got the White
House and just like a bunch of them up
in my little area that I got at work so
I built with nano Legos and I am a
beauty guru I'm just kidding I'm not a
beauty guru anyway all right let's move
on to the next one that was long enough
heels or flats definitely flats
I hate heels I own heels but I hate them
if you could do anything
one day and money wasn't an option how
would you spend your day dream big I
would probably go to some kind I don't
know because part of me wants to go
shopping in New York City and just go
nuts and just buy whatever I want but
then part of me wants to go to like an
amazing beach or something and just
chill out and drink margaritas and just
have a blast like somewhere with my
husband doing that you know what I would
probably do that I would probably just
go somewhere with my husband that was
just absolutely amazing like go to a
beach or something or I don't know I
can't even decide because then part of
me wants to go to like Ireland or
Scotland or Wales or somewhere somewhere
and go see like castles and you know go
see like history kinds of stuff I don't
know I can't decide one of those three
options shopping in New York City a
beach somewhere with my husband are
going Castle seeing in Europe that would
be amazing those three I can't pick they
all tie but was the last YouTube video
you watched let's see what what's the
last YouTube video I watched I don't
know
the last one I legitimately watched was
a birch box box opening by pearls and
daggers and then before that I watched
the I ripped off my nail tutorial by Q
polish and then before that was a video
by Stefanie Laurie and then before that
was a video by savanah and stuff do you
have road rage not really I used to but
not really anymore I get mad and oh come
on you know or yell or honk my horn but
I don't really have road rage you know I
mean I have road irritated and not
rarely road rage what's your favorite
rock and roll song 18 in life by Skid
Row I don't know no that's not my
favorite what would every rose has its
thorn by poison every rose has is though
there's so many good ones
so many good songs those are the songs I
grew up listening to who was your first
kiss do you still talk to them no my
first kiss was in early junior high I
was the roller skating rink and met a
boy and we kissed by the popcorn machine
and we kissed like this because we both
watched them maybe cry-baby and we
thought that was the way people were
really supposed to kiss she
that relationship was doomed from the
jump we dated for about two weeks
meaning we saw each other like three
times and then it was over and I never
saw him again
I mean was that the guy that told me I
was dumped like a dump truck I don't
know I think I might have been the
second boyfriend I think the second
boyfriend told me I was dumped like a
dump truck that guy just kind of
disappeared but no I haven't seen him
since I was 13 or 12 maybe I was I was
really young if you could have one
youtuber's closet who would it be miss
Jen fabulous no joke I would take that
girl dress is so nice I would just I
would take her closet absolutely I love
like all the shirt she wears in her
jewelry and you could have one youtubers
makeup collection who would it be I
could steal what Kristin said and say
Tara babies because I think that she
everybody wants her makeup collection
but I think I'm gonna go Emily Noelle 83
because I feel like she gets a lot more
stuff that I would actually use wear
tear babies gets a lot of like wild
crazy stuff but yeah probably Emily
Noelle 83 or you know what I think I'm
gonna change that I'm gonna change that
to Laura from mrs. Lowell Lynne because
she has some amazing stuff that I've
always wanted to try and probably never
will like her matte collection and her
you know all the boob blushes I forget
who makes those the blushes that look
like boobs I want to try them they look
very offensive but I want to try them
I'm gonna go with mrs. Lowe Lola and
Laura that's true when Goss does have a
lot of time for and see I got him
watching Beauty videos yes I do okay do
you have a nickname I have multiple
nicknames Jenn is of course my nickname
my real name is Jennifer the only person
that calls me Jennifer is actually John
Jenny was my nickname growing up my
favorite nickname I've ever gotten was
from my friend Amy for her wedding and
she called me the matron of brutal
optimism which is me in a nutshell she
also called me spider monkey which is
also an amazing nickname what do you
think is the best thing about your
YouTube channel the thing that people
tell me is the best thing about my
youtube channel is my honesty and my
nests and just that I'm just me and I
just talk and that's just the way things
are and I just I can just be myself
and I don't have to worry about it I can
just you know whatever just be myself
because if anybody that has never seen
my videos watches this video they're
gonna be like yeah that's Jen that's
just that's just the way that I am this
is this is really me and I love just
being able to be myself on my youtube
channel how many cars have you had and
what were they these are the most random
questions my very first car was a 1986
Chevy Nova yes that was a good car I
bought it for 2,500 bucks from my
brother's friend's girlfriend and that
was a good car while it lasted after
that I don't know what year it was but I
had a purple Chevy Cavalier and I loved
that car and I totaled that car and it
made me cry I had after that an eclipse
I had a silver eclipse and I hated it it
was horrible it was the slowest car I've
ever driven it's super cute but slower
than hell I had a silver Mazda 3 and now
I have a red Mazda 6 it is my dream car
I love my car my red Mazda 6 is my
favorite car of all time
I don't want any other car ever I just
want boss the sixes forever it's amazing
that's all I gotta say about that what's
your favorite pizza my favorite pizza is
Hawaiian yes we're gonna leave it at
that and then lastly if you could only
have one lipstick the rest of your life
what lipstick would you choose I don't I
don't care about lipstick that much
honestly I could go without lipstick the
rest of my life I would not be able to
go without chapstick the rest of my life
I need something moisturizing my lips
whether it's lipstick or chapstick or
something I need something on my lips
like to make them feel like they're not
dry but I there's no lipstick that I
would not be able to live without there
isn't it doesn't exist
that's a horrible ending to this video
but that's the truth I mean I I don't I
don't have a favorite lipstick I wear
lipstick because I do YouTube videos if
I didn't knew YouTube videos I wouldn't
have lipsticks I wouldn't I don't think
I had lipstick before I started making
YouTube videos I guess I might have to I
mean like like this is one of my
favorites this is NARS dolce vita I love
this lipstick I mean it's just like
pink annuity pinks I love nudie Pink's I
mean but nothing is like my favorite
it's not a good question for me to end
on it's really not while we change this
if you only have one eyeshadow palette
for the rest of your life if I could
only have one eyeshadow palette the rest
of my life it would be the Kat Von D
spell that I shadow book this thing's
amazing but I just did a review on the
new one for this holiday season don't
buy it it's terrible but this one was
amazing so we're gonna switch it on that
so that I can end it on a positive note
