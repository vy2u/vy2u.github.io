one of my most requested videos I'm
serious like every single video I shoot
I shoot mostly in front of this thing I
get two or three comments asking me to
do a pilot collection video I'm going to
do it through the confessions of a pilot
addict tag and it was created by the
beautiful ladies over glam moms I
believe Rochelle is the one responsible
for it Jennifer is also over there
but at Rochelle is the one that did it
on her channel and the questions are
awesome I like it much better than the
perfect palette tag and some of the
other tanks around there and my cat is
very excited because this thing has
moved and there's now some open space
that she has not marked with her scent
so she's probably going to hang out
there for a while you know hang out
start licking things that's what she
does so let's go ahead and jump into
this first question you cannot judge me
you cannot judge me I will not tell you
unless you promise not to judge me okay
you've promised right I'm gonna trust
that you've promised and the first
question is how many palettes do you
have and the way that I kind of went
about it was I decided that I was only
going to count it as a palette and if it
had four or more eyeshadows because this
I have so many trios and duo's and all
that stuff I was like it's just gonna be
stupid so I have 41 palettes 41 pallets
of four eyeshadows or more and that is
that's a problem and I realize that's a
problem but we're not gonna get into my
problem because I think you just want to
see what I've got so okay second
question is how many of these are
eyeshadow palettes and that answer is
thirty eight of them monthly eyeshadow
palettes I know it's bad okay leaving
not eyeshadow palettes as three and I
will show you those in a moment actually
I'll show them to you now I counted this
one as an eyeshadow palette this is the
balm Jovi palette by the balm and it's
eyeshadows and then it is lip products
down there I did camp assistant and eye
shadow palette I do have the how about
them apples by the balm this is not my
favorite palette the blushes in here
of who
No and some of them are very workable
some of them are a little too crazy for
me the cream formula is not my favorite
and they definitely most of them will
not work as lip products so definitely
not my favorite from the balm there but
this one is not an eyeshadow palette and
this is the NARS foreplay that is no
longer available and this is not my
favorite either
I just this highlight is yellow these
two are very loud and that has orgasm
which is a nice color I do think that is
weight over height even though I do like
it I don't think it's the end all be all
of blushes orgasm by NARS is like Oh
everywhere this one's really
embarrassing because this is actually if
you go back to my very first video this
was the only lip product that I owned in
my very first what's in my makeup bag
video which was my entire makeup
collection at the time this was it it's
the artist lipstick palette by Sephora I
don't know how old this thing is but it
is going to be going in the trash as
soon as I'm done shooting this video
because these are just discussed I don't
know why I still have this I never use
it and it's really old and disgusting so
I'm gonna have 40 palettes after this
instead of 41
what are your palette regrets is the
next question and this one does my
biggest regret this is by Pixie this is
the soft fresh focus palette and this
was one of the first eyeshadow palettes
that I bought I just love the way that
it looked I actually ended up giving it
to my daughter because none of these
eyeshadows are pigmented like it's like
there's nothing to them actually they
don't even seem that bad now
oh I remember why because they brushed
away that was why because when you apply
them they just go away as soon as you
try to blend them these over here
weren't quite as bad but hated this
palette total total total regret this
was a terrible palette the other one
that I have is this one by lorac it's
the stylist eyeshadow palette and this
one I just did not like the shades in it
you know it's a touch they feel very
soft but I just did not like the quality
of them at all just not impressed with
this palette No
not not up to the Larocque standards in
my opinion i have some great lorac
palettes this is not one of them okay
how many limited-edition or holiday
palace do you have honestly I don't know
because a lot of these have been
discontinued but I don't know if they
are where limited-edition I can tell you
that this one here was limited-edition
and this is my favorite one of my
favorite palettes of all time I also
have the vice palette which was limited
edition the mint addition by lorac that
I love is limit was limited edition I
know this Tarte palette this was the
Tarte Kapoor palette I don't think they
sell this anymore that a lot of the
light shades are pretty similar I don't
know I'm not a huge fan of taran shadows
at least from this palette this the only
Tarte eyeshadow palette that I own I've
heard some great things about some of
their other palettes but I wasn't that
impressed by this one it's fine it's
okay but it's not like blow you away
kind of situation these over here this
was on the Urban Decay Book of Shadows
for i depotted them and they're now in
the Z palette with a bunch of makeup
geek shadows that that packaging was
just stupid it was gigantic so I took
them out this here is the Sephora
palette that I really like it's a pocket
palette right there and I'm actually
going to be giving one of these away in
this video I got two of them one for you
guys and one for me just for a good you
know a way to give something away and
this one is probably more of a fall
palette but you can make it work for
spring but I'm going to be giving one of
these away to one of you from this video
so if you're interested in the support
palette it's very nice I really love
this palette I don't reach for it a
whole lot I don't know why I guess
because I just have a lot of Shadows
like this but this the shadows are very
very creamy they're really nice you know
if you want this put a comment down
below that you're interested in the
Sephora Sephora eyes shadow palette and
I will be picking a winner within the
first 24 hours are they uploaded this
video somewhere probably in about 20
hour 26 28 somewhere I pick a winner
this was from the lorac candy collection
I just kept one of those I gave the rest
of them away this here was limited
edition this is the lorac downtown drama
I really love this one this one's really
nice that said this one's discontinued
now this is the Kat Von D Ludwig palette
this might have been my very first
high-end eyeshadow in a high-end but you
know II mean Sephora
i shadow purchase and love love love
this palette still oh i don't know if
the Esperanza palette is limited-edition
or not but I love this palette - this
thing's awesome
I'm like showing you a whole collection
yeah this is great I miss a question all
right
top three favorite eyeshadow palettes
number one favorite eyeshadow palette is
this Kat Von D spellbinding eyeshadow
book which was limited edition but I
absolutely love this palette I love all
the colors in here and they just are so
easy to apply and there's just so many
choices so many color combinations just
an amazing amazing just a selection of
shadows just beautiful and really fun to
play with if you like colors and then
next favorite naked - definitely a
favorite I don't know anybody that owns
this that this isn't one of their
favorites actually no that's not true
there are a couple people I've heard
that prefer one of the other palettes or
another nude palette like the lorac Pro
palette instead of this one but I
personally love my naked 2 because it
was like oh when I use these eyeshadows
I can actually do my eyeshadow and it
looks really nice so this was part of
the reason why I started my beauty
channel and well at least one of the
reasons why I continued it because I
think I had barely started when I got
this but I was like yes I can do this
when I got that palette third favorite
it cosmetics naturally pretty palette
really really love these shadows I love
that their mats can reach just a ton of
beautiful matte eye looks but but the
transforming pearl I am NOT a big fan of
because it doesn't really transform the
shadows it is really nice for a brow
bone highlight but yeah really have fun
playing with these colors so yeah that's
my third favorite love love love love
this palette okay next question is how
many of your palettes are custom
palettes I would consider this one a
custom palette it's got book of shadows
for over here and I've got a ton of
makeup geek shadows and then a couple
other single shadows here there are no
Mac shadows in here I do not own a
single Mac shadows I know that they're
amazing but I've got so many eyeshadows
and I want to try so many things that
it's like what's the point of buying a
Mac eye shadow
when everybody and their grandmother has
reviewed them you know what I'm saying I
don't know if that makes sense to you
but it makes sense in my world so I've
got a bunch of makeup geek shadows in
here this one is not a makeup geek
shadow I forget what company that is and
then this one is not this one is
semi-formal by
mirabela I think but the rest of these
are makeup geek eyeshadows this one is
one of my favorites I know that that's
really weird cuz it's red this is called
razzle berry by makeup geek look how
gorgeous that is oh my gosh
I barely have a reason to use this but
when I do is just gorgeous I have my new
Inglot that I got at IMATS and honestly
my friends this is not the end-all
be-all my favorite thing on the planet
it's really not I thought it was going
to be and it's not I got all matte
shades I got some springy things I got
some blending colors and you know
they're good they're not shadows but
they're not what I thought they were
gonna be I thought they were gonna be
amazing but they're you know they're
just nice shadows and the other thing I
don't like about Inglot is unless you
have some kind of magnetic something for
them there is really no functional way
to store these without them being
damaged so I don't like that let me show
you real quick I did do a video showing
everything I got from IMATS and I had a
little Inglot palette tragedy the person
who sold them to me actually I'll give
her credit she actually ended up sending
me some replacement shadows for this
thing that happened I'm not gonna go
into all of it I've got these two loose
Inglot shadows and it really bothers me
that they're out and loose because
there's nothing to protect them from
damage and that just is upsetting so I
have to get some other kind of magnetic
palette or make one or something to
protect these of all the palettes I own
which one wasn't worth the price this is
actually a huge regret of mine every
time I look at this it makes me sad
because it was like $60 and it's this
NARS and God created woman palette I
really dislike this palette I dislike
these eyeshadows I dislike this palette
the eyeshadows are pigmented but they
are so hard to blend this is one of the
most difficult palettes I've ever had to
work with I just don't enjoy it and the
colors are just not the selection is
just not to my taste I think this would
work much better on someone with a
darker skin tone and it was stupid
expensive and every time I look at it it
makes me sad I do occasionally reach for
this for just one of them if I need a
darker shade and I can't get it in the
palette that I'm in I'll reach for it
but I don't reach for this nearly as
much as I should considering how
expensive this stupid thing was alright
how it's worth
penny I would definitely say this one
here definitely this is like one of my
favorite palettes of all time I've
talked about that and another one that I
haven't showed you that I feel like is
worth the new price because it has been
reduced it was originally like $75 and
now it sounds quite a bit down is the
Emma Cosmetics life style palette or
life palette I've never showed this I
got this for Christmas and I never
showed it to you that I have it and I
love this palette this is a really
really nice palette I feel like the
packaging is extremely having extremely
bulky I do have the smaller palette to
put some of these selections in but I
didn't want to move anything until I
showed it to you I was gonna do a full
review on this and I just never did this
is my Michelle Phan if you've never seen
it before and Michelle Phan if you don't
know who she is then you know you're
definitely missing out she's I think
she's the most popular beauty video
creator on YouTube so these this is kind
of how it comes and it comes with this
little tool and you can pick the
different colors out by using the tool
and then put them in the smaller palette
it also comes with this little mini
relatively useless brush but that's okay
it was nice of her to include it but the
quality of these shadows and blushes are
beautiful they're wonderful on lip
products their color but the shadows and
the blushes and the highlights I really
really like in this and I do feel like
it is worth the newer price which is a
lot cheaper than $75 I'm not sure how
much of what it is now but I would
definitely pay a reduced price for this
I know that's kind of weird I don't know
how much it cost but it's worth the
price but I just want okay alright let
me admit it alright I'm gonna be honest
I just want to show you this palette and
it doesn't fit in anywhere else I don't
know if it's worth the price or not okay
throwing it out it's definitely worth
the price was this galaxy chick J galaxy
chic by BH Cosmetics baked eyeshadow
palette I love this thing if you like
colors this thing is amazing I do have a
video on all of these with up-close
clothes swatches and all of that if you
love colors this is a fantastic palette
I'm not as big of a fan of the BH
Cosmetics other eyeshadows but this one
is amazing so it's definitely worth the
price on this I think it was like twelve
or fourteen dollars so so worth the
price on that of the last twelve months
how many palettes have I either given
away or returned and the answer to that
would be two I returned the door holiday
palette at Christmas time I also
returned the Urban Decay shattered face
case or something it was the limited
edition one that they had at Sephora and
I hated both of them I did not think
they were worth the price and just did
was not a fan of either one of those I
do have videos about those I'll link
those down below as well I have a full
review on the do or one and why I hated
it okay if for some reason all of my
palettes disappeared and I can only go
repurchase three palettes something like
that which ones what I want to get well
this one would be out of the question
because it is limited edition so I
wouldn't be able to get that one again
so I would definitely get my naked - I
would definitely guess what else naked -
what else would I get I'll probably get
this - this is the Kat Von D lady Burke
palette I love this palette for fall and
winter I probably get that and then I
would get the pH cosmetics I would run
back and get this because I need some
color in my life a lot of times and this
gives me every color that I could
possibly ever want I think that's all
the questions and I didn't get to show
you all the palettes that I've got so I
got to show you some more stuff because
I got lots of stuff okay so these my
friend ELISA gave me these were limited
edition going into the world and you'd
awakening from wet-and-wild I have those
this one is comfort zone by wet and wild
love this palette this is the Too Faced
matte eye palette I really like this one
a lot some beautiful matte shades and
they are really fun to work with this
here a friend of mine gave me this is
the ready to glow by profusion I don't
use this very often because it is quite
powdery not the biggest fan of that one
the new tube palette again one that I
don't really reach for a whole lot but
has some beautiful shades I just don't
reach for it a whole lot this is the
neat matte nude this one I haven't
reached for as much lately but it is a
wonderful palette fantastic palette for
nude shades I it's missing a color for
me it's missing a good solid champagne
color and missing I'm sad about that
that's probably part of the reason why I
don't reach for it very much but really
really a very nice palette there these
Smashbox this is another regret that I
forgot to mention the Smashbox full
exposure palette I wish I love this I
got this with Birchbox points the matte
shades are phenomenal the brush is
wonderful these shimmer shades are what
I have an issue with the shimmer shades
have so much fallout I got glitter face
at the end of the day like it's like my
whole face is just covered in glitter
and I cannot stand it so this is one
that I do not like and I'm sad to say
because I know a lot of people love this
love again level of level of love the
matte shades hate the glitter shades the
cargo palette this is the warm neutrals
palette I absolutely adore this I just
got it in a little black bag
my last little black bag haul that I
just put up not too long ago love in
love with this palette so easy to blend
it just beautiful let's see this is the
Naked basics palette I can see why
people don't like this I personally love
it I feel like these shades are very
very very similar you might have colors
just like this in your collection if you
do you don't need it but if you don't or
if you're new into using makeup this is
a fantastic palette this is the urban
decay I forget what it's called palette
I honestly don't remember but this is a
really fun palette with colors in it
that I like and some of the glitter ones
do have some fall out like this one Maui
wowie have some fall out oil slick has
some fall out grifter has some fall out
but it is a really nice palette really
fun to play with overall but just not a
fan of some of the fallout and some of
those shadows this is the julep palette
this is what we got in our subscription
a few months back this is the neutrals
palette and I love this palette these
shadows are so creamy so buttery and
amazing which is a big thing for julep
because I don't typically like a lot of
their other products that they have that
are besides the nail polishes this is a
two-faced little black book of beauty I
like this palette it's a nice palette
it's not my favorite I never reach for
it anymore I used to reach for it more
than I do now
I just I don't know it's just I don't
know not my favorite oh no I got a few
more can you believe it
okay this actually inherited from my
grandmother and I cannot bear to part
with it even though it is a little bit
old this is the color design by Estee
Lauder I believe and I love these
shadows they just remind me of her
they're like her perfect shades so I
keep that one
these are Maybelline eye studio quads
this one is in Sunset seduction this one
is in spirited as spirited C's man and
then this one is in irresistible ivy and
these make really nice looks I do really
like these a lot
oh my goodness what I'm just below the
shadow just totally fell out of there
oh that's so weird oh no I better be
careful with that one yeah I really like
these formulas they're very nice they're
I think they're a little overpriced but
I think they're nice and then this is a
Mirabella quad this is the jewelry box
collection I don't think they sell this
anymore but this one is really nice as
well
all right I think I showed you all my
palettes and for those of you that ask
where I got this thing I got it at
Michael's in the mailing like office
supply section about a year ago or so
and I really like this so check your
local Marshalls TJ Maxx and look in
their office supply sex and see if you
can find something like this if you're
looking for something to hold your
pallet so thank you so much for watching
