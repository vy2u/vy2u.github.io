hello my friends welcome to this crazy
video now some of you that are older
than me are going to laugh at me and
some of you that are younger than me are
going to be like what okay basically
here's the story so I was on Groupon
just browsing you know I could do on
Groupon and I saw this thing and I was
like wow that would make for a great
video so I went on periscope and I show
my friends my parallels on periscope you
want to be a parent loved you just have
to follow me on periscope it's an iPhone
or Android app and my older friend my
friends that are you know in their 40s
50s 60s said oh my goodness that's a
bonnet that's nothing like crazy or new
like this thing is from like you old
actually so basically what you do is you
hook this up to your hairdryer and you
can use it hot rollers like you put
rollers in your hair and it'll make the
your hair dry in your rollers so it's
got like this little attachment here
there's no directions on this thing it
just came with this piece of paper and
it just said it's easy to use
lightweight convenient for travel large
bouffant size fits all hair dryers great
for styling setting with styling and
setting with rods and rollers that's the
only direction that comes with it but I
did a little bit of research and this
was the style of the earliest hair
dryers you would hook this up to a wind
tunnel thing in the salon and in the
early 1950s and then they would dry your
hair in the salon with this and then
they Conair made one that was for home
use so that's when they started making
these for home I don't have con hair was
the first one but so these things are
things that apparently people use all
the time which I've never used one
before so we're going to use one today
and we're
a little bit of fun so we're gonna see
how this thing works if you open it up
it's like a drawstring bag and on the
inside there's all of these little holes
inside and I just thought it would be
fun you know trying something new that
I've never tried before so I've got my
hairdryer here and I'm going to slip
this onto my hair dryer so I've got it
on the air
okay let's put this on the head my hair
is a little as dried a little tiny bit
because my son needed some stuff but you
can see in the back it's still very very
very wet I got to tuck my hair up in
this thing
maybe if I tighten it a little bit what
is over here and my hair typically
because like my hair is so thin my hair
only takes like 3 minutes to dry so I'm
curious to see whether this is going to
be faster or slower or what or if it's
going to make my hair knotty mess
alright here we go now this is the big
question am I going to look like this
chick when I'm done ready set go
take it out take it out
turn it off - but the guy needs to be
tighter around in my head I feel like
it's going to blow off oh I want to set
the timer to see the time it does faster
so I spit on there for about ten seconds
so me set the timer for three minutes
and I know my hair was a little bit dry
so we'll take that into account go
I don't have enough hands for this
device because I needed two hands to
hold it on my head
and I mean one hand to hold the hair dry
here what a guy
know she's got her ears tucked in no I'm
nauseous
I think they photoshopped this thing on
her head look her ear is like chopped
off you can't even tell whether it's
over under her ear because it's just
Photoshop go on top of it
uh-huh cheaters go
tight as it can go all right here we go
restarting timer and
hop so Tigers going off that was three
minutes ish and my hair is still wet
right here it's dry over here so we'll
probably going to need a whole nother
minute and it's hurting my head it's
hurting my ears it's burning right here
like it hurts and I'm putting it on I'll
show you I'm putting it on this low
right here and then I'm putting it on
high here so I think I'm going to do is
I'm going to do low and low now for that
last minute because then maybe it won't
blow the bonnet off now feel cold maybe
there's something wrong with my
hairdryer white felt so hot let's turn
it on more it might have been on hot
then need for it to be on top this feels
much better putting on the low air
instead of a high air timer son one more
minute in alright my hair is almost dry
almost dry I can still feel a little wet
down here the problem is this side feels
pretty much completely driving by the
one that was by the hose but this side
does not so I'm going to stick the hose
over on the other side hopefully will
dry the side within another minute set
and go
so one more minute is done all right my
hair is now officially dry whoa still
has one more little patch down here it's
just not drawing my hair evenly so I
would imagine this will work better for
somebody that is using the rollers
I would imagine what look better work
better for someone with shorter hair
than mine I definitely is not a good
brand in that the strap does not stay on
what I could say though is this elastic
did stay on very well but this this was
not effective this little pull string
thing was not effective in holding it on
my head i'd-- emily if you are going to
try this I would definitely recommend
not putting on hot because I
accidentally had it on hot and I was
burning my head off put it on low and
then put the air on low that was were
kind of the things that I learned about
this overall I don't think I'm going to
be using this again I feel like it's
more work than it's worth I just I do
feel like I like the way that looks I'm
getting my curls look nice I was afraid
it was going to make my hair very knotty
it didn't my hair does not not very
easily though my hair it's I can still
rub my fingers to it but my hair so thin
it doesn't not very easily so I wouldn't
hold that too claims for everybody but
overall I mean I think it's a fun thing
to try um it's just not worth the effort
for me and I guess that's why we've
advanced to not using them and just
using me maybe but apparently people
still use these things so they must work
for somebody so if you have experience
with one of these bonnets I'd love to
hear your experiences down below do you
have you ever use them do you still use
them is it something that you use it a
certain way that I didn't try overall I
don't know anything about this so
anything you want to teach me about this
product down below I would love to learn
