in today's video girl oh honey honey
honey honey we're gonna be doing
something a little more fun a little
more lighthearted the trend of Jimmy
someone else's makeup tutorial is all
over the place but I decided to do
something a little more unique I'm gonna
turn myself into rich lugs so you want
to see how I got this fabulous look
today
hang tight we're getting into it right
now I had another video scheduled to go
live today and that was my box of
crayons I shadow palette review but it's
not quite ready because you know I got
to do everything extra so it's not quite
ready I wanted to do something that I
could film really quickly and add it
really quickly for you so that I could
have it up for you today on Tuesday and
I was like what better thing to do than
to doing someone be doing someone else's
makeup tutorial challenge but I think I
wanted to do it in a different way so I
thought well whose makeup could I just
copy and see if I could just recreate it
without a tutorial and the first person
I thought of was rich looks if you don't
know who rich luxe is he has a youtube
drama channel and he focuses on Beauty
video creators and does his drama
Channel now before you get on me and be
a poindexter and unsubscribe I do not
agree with everything rich lungfish Lux
has ever done I don't I I mean you do I
agree with everything I've ever done no
I don't I do find rich to be a very
light-hearted and fun Channel even
though I don't necessarily agree with
everything that he chooses to do I also
have a lot of respect for rich in that
the branding on his channel if you've
never seen it is very very good I'm
gonna go ahead and throw in a little
clip of one of Rich's video intros right
now so you can kind of see what I'm
saying
not bother at the house what's going on
everyone's rich luxe in today's video oh
honey honey honey
guess what okay see if you like the
video smash that like button comment
rate subscribe if you don't like the
video say to your haters when they watch
it they lost 10 minutes of their life
they'll never get back and I'll see you
next video peace and this is the thing
as I find myself saying some of these
things randomly I'm like o'clock at the
house and you know in today's video girl
like I find myself doing these weird
things because riches branding is so
incredibly strong and I admire him for
that for coming up you know out of the
gate well maybe not out of the gate but
he came out of strong with all of these
things that make rich rich that are
different from every other YouTube
channel and it's really hard to be
unique so in that way I definitely
admire him and plus I just wanted to see
if I could do this makeup look so this
is the look I'm gonna try to recreate
today which is pretty much Rich's
typical look he changes up his lid color
you know sometimes it's pink sometimes
it's purple but I thought the blue would
be really really fun I could also show
you the box of crayons palette a little
bit even though the full review
hopefully if I can get all the pieces
done will be up on Thursday I did for
wear test so it's you know I take on
Lobell work so let's go ahead and jump
in rich always wears a very full
coverage foundation so I'm gonna go
ahead and use the anasazi beverly hills
stick foundation and this is not my
favorite but it does provide a more full
coverage look and that's what we're
gonna be going for for Rich's look I'm
not gonna put on any primer on because I
am NOT planning on keeping this on for
more than about 15 minutes
I'm not gonna worry about concealers
today because we're gonna cover all of
that up with other makeups so I'm not
worried about that part rich always
seems to have a little bit of a luminous
look about him so I'm not gonna set this
with powder I'm just gonna leave it as
is okay so let's now go into the brows
now rich has very dark brows so we're
gonna be using my Christian and
cosmetics brow pomade which is a really
really good comparison to the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills brow pomade but it is much
less expensive we actually kind of have
similar brow shapes his are just a
little bit bigger than mine I'm feeling
very Groucho Marx right now I feel like
the most important thing to recreating
Rich's look is a white crayon the NYX
pencil in milk is what I'm assuming that
he uses and we're gonna use that today
and it looks like what he does is he
just puts it kind of in a curve around
his eye and then triangles it down let's
start with that this is so fun and then
we're gonna curve it up and around and
he gets right up to his lash line
pluck at the house girl now the fun fun
part is going in with the blue he's got
it all over his lid look at that boom
and he also carries it up and over into
the inner corner he almost barely has
any of the white showing so cover up a
little bit more of the white up here and
the same thing on the other eye now he's
got it down on the lower lash line but
he doesn't go all the way he goes like
three-quarters of the way so let's do it
now it really pulls this together is the
eyeliner my epic ink liner my baby I
hope we don't get too much white on it
his cheeks are much rounder than mine I
think I might have gone down a little
bit too far here hmm okay well we're
just gonna go for it this is so fun
never did I expect to be doing this
right now
fun though looks like it's a little bit
thicker at the top here I don't know if
that's intentional or what but we'll
make it a little thicker oh there we go
okay make it a little thicker on this
side to match that side went better so
my friend Nancy had sent me these for my
daughter
these are mermaid and nail crystals and
I'm just gonna take these guys right
here and we're gonna stick them I don't
know if they have enough glue on them to
stick I don't think they do we're going
to use some lash glue should we use the
big ones now let's use the big ones
let's go for the gold I bought these at
spirit at the end of the holiday like
Halloween season so they were six bucks
original price so I think I paid like
two dollars or something for these and I
was like I don't know when I'm gonna use
these but I just want them they're very
very rich they've got the holographic
strips in there and yes it's happening
it's happening the lash band is really
thin so I'm just gonna put some eyeliner
on real quick as I'm trimming these
lashes I'm sitting here thinking I don't
think rich probably trims his lashes
because they always seem so huge but
we're gonna trim the lashes anyway cuz I
already started and I can't go back I'm
hoping these are dry my little gemstone
so let's try it hopefully they're dry
enough oh I don't know how he keeps
these things on his face because this is
not comfortable
I definitely don't enjoy the way that
that feels while we're waiting for the
lash glue to dry a little bit let's go
ahead and put on some pink lips this is
our glasses shade in leader this is
their girl line I don't think I've ever
used this ever this I got at generation
Beauty and I didn't pay for it because I
never would have bought this color but I
saved it because I wanted to try out
this formula and I just haven't gotten
around to trying it
yes this is shaping up nicely you know
you're gonna try this you know you want
to lash number one I think I'm gonna let
it drive too long you're not sticking
now darn man let's try the other one why
I let the lash glue dry too long
darn and purposely not going to color my
natural lashes because I don't think
rich does so I'm not going to do it
either
I'm pretty sure in this video rich has a
little bit of silver glitter on his lip
so I'm gonna use the litter this is in
the shade champagne wishes I think his
is silver but I think this is the
closest that I have to silver
oh I like that that's actually really
pretty
hmm all right let's go see what the kids
think all right
Lila you ready to see my makeup what do
you think what do you think how'd I do
yeah do I look like do I look like that
guy you know what his name is what was
his name you remember yeah rich luxe you
remember any of the things that rich
says I agree I agreed but do you think I
did a good job cool man

gonna go down anything I could see if I
can turn some lights on okay he turn the
lights on in there for me Lila turn the
kitchen lights on all right what do you
think of mommy's makeup pretty that's
all you have to say I look pretty that's
it huh cat was playing in the paper bag

don't think this video is good without
the pig there because there's like a big
space my tiara keeps flopping I had so
much fun making this video I feel like
me and a lot of other youtubers that I
talk with all the time sometimes we take
YouTube a little bit too seriously and
I'm definitely guilty of this this video
really helped me to not take YouTube
super seriously and I thank rich for
being an inspiration for that because
this really was so much fun to film I
had a great time so thank you so much
for watching

chose it okay alright if you like this
