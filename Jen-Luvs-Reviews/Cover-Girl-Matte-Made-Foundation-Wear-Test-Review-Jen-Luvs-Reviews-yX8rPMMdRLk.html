are tuned into the beauty space this
past year have noticed the lack of shade
range and complexion products both at
the drugstore and also high end and
covergirl has come out with or they're
about to come out with a foundation that
has 40 shades but the question is is it
a good foundation is it worth your money
so that's what we're gonna be testing
today and we're gonna be getting into
that right now as you may have noticed
if you follow a lot of people that make
Beauty content either on Instagram or on
YouTube you've probably seen the giant
Peola boxes that went out from covergirl
of their new true blend
matte matte made I want to say made
matte but it's Matt made foundation I
did receive one of those boxes so thank
you to covergirl for sending it to me I
put up a bunch of swatch pictures on my
Instagram as you can see on the left
side of the photo I have put in swatches
that are wet and then what I did was I
allowed the foundation to dry completely
on my arm that was at least 30 minutes
sometimes even longer if I was busy just
to see if the Foundation's were
oxidizing if they changed it all as they
dried down because when we put a
foundation on like let's say maybe
there's a tester in the store I don't
know if there's gonna be testers of
these products sometimes they look
different after they've been sitting on
skin for a while so I wanted to be able
to represent both of those for you so
those pictures are up on my Instagram if
you want them for reference let's say
you're in store and you want to purchase
you can pull that up and check it out
what we're gonna be doing today is we
are going to be testing out doing a full
day wear test of the foundation along
with the primers that just came out
we're going to be doing one primer on
one side one primer on the other side
there are four of the primers there's
the skin smoothing one there is the pore
minimizing one which skin smoothing and
pore minimizing I'm wondering I kind of
see those as kind of being similar in
that when you're minimizing pores you're
smoothing the skin I don't know color
and neutralizing and then we also have
the illuminating they look like they
have pretty much the same ingredients
but they're in different orders so I
don't know how much that order makes a
difference but I really feel like I
can't try more than two so I think what
we're going to do is we'll do
let's do the skin smoothing one since I
have more fine lines than I have pores
and we'll do the illuminate one to see
if that makes a difference we're also
going to be shade matching me I've got
five different shades of the foundation
here I've also got five foundations that
I already own from different brands that
we're gonna compare so you can kind of
see if you're a similar skin tone to me
which foundations might match before we
get into that let's just get a little
bit into the brand itself just in case
you are not aware covergirl is a
drugstore brand they've been sold in
drugstores for many many many many many
many years they are not a cruelty-free
brand because they do sell in mainland
China and the logic behind that I've
been getting a lot of questions about
this lately the logic behind that is
even though covergirl does not test
their products in the United States on
animals because they sell in China they
know their products are gonna be tested
on animals so in a way they're kind of
condoning the animal testing by selling
their products in China knowing that
they're going to be tested on animals
even though they don't do the testing
themselves that's how all of that works
and that is very similar to many non
cruelty-free brands that are on the
market today as far as ingredients go
just some things to be aware of just so
you know this is considered a silicon
based foundation water is the number one
ingredient but water is the number one
ingredient in most silicone based
products it's just the way in order to
make the product work you need water
most of the time so just if you see
water as the first ingredient that
doesn't mean it's water-based you want
to look for octane or cone as far as the
end of the word to know whether it's
silicone based and one thing I noticed
that the base of all of the primers is
the same as the foundation which is
really smart because that means they
will blend well together which is great
so cyclo penta siloxane is the second
ingredient and this is an ingredient
that isn't super environmentally
friendly it does build up in the
environment and it doesn't biodegrade
very well so if you're using this
product what I would recommend if you
can is to wipe it off and throw the wipe
away rather than washing it down the
sink if you can the third ingredient is
talc some people are sensitive to talk
so if you are unfortunately this
foundation is not going to be for you
the fifth ingredient is also dimethicone
there's another dimethicone at number
six and the last thing I wanted to
mention to you was the preservative
which is phenoxyethanol phenoxyethanol
some people are sensitive to this is
what a lot of companies use instead of
parabens when people freaked out about
parabens they replace it with
phenoxyethanol but some people are also
sensitive to phenoxyethanol I figured I
would mention that just in case that's
you oh my gosh right now it's the curse
of spring it's brighter in here but yeah
we have more outside noise so let's go
ahead and let shade match me I think
this is going to be a lot of fun to
figure out I did wear one of the shades
yesterday and it was definitely too dark
for me but I was just hanging out in my
family so but this is the picture of me
not matching no to the eyebrow it's like
white and then darker oops I saw this
technique on the channel too much mouth
and I just have fallen in love with her
channel recently she is so adorable and
so honest and I just love her so what
she does is she swatches them on the
side of her face so that's what we're
gonna go ahead and do when I put the
swatches up of my arm on Instagram you
know one shade looked like it might be
the right shade but next to my face may
put the not sunlit side my face is a
slightly different color than my arm so
you know what we'll do a bunch of
different ones but this was the one that
people said looked the closest to my
skin tone and I agree as far as the
swatches on Instagram this is called l20
this is the lightest shade so let's go
ahead and swatch that ok well we'll go
ahead and let that dry while we do l15
this one is just a little bit pinkier I
believe this is called porcelain which I
don't think looks porcelain at all that
is definitely not porcelain the next one
that looked close to me was l40
I'm running out of cheek space here
because I want to do the ones that I
already own above and this one is m15
hopefully you can see what I'm doing
here and we turn a little bit cuz I'm
starting to run out here okay so what
we'll do is I'll put em 20 on this side
over here this was the one I wore
yesterday that I know is way too dark
okay while those dry I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch Fenty's 150 which was what I
was shade matched for for Fenty Too
Faced vanilla this is the Too Faced Born
This Way
this is L'Oreal's 103 of their pro matte
line and then this is l'oréal's visible
lift blur foundation this is in the
shade 204 which is called creamy natural
and then finally I have the Revlon youth
FX this is in the shade finally I have
the Revlon youth effects this is in the
shade 220 natural beige
so as you can see some of these shades
don't match me right now I do have a
little bit of a range around but I
wanted to show you a range so in case
you don't exactly match me you can kind
of see how these shades compare so I'm
gonna just go ahead and pause that with
the shades labeled on there so you can
see what everything is I honestly think
that
l40 is my match which is called classic
ivory for my eyes that's what I see I'll
be curious to know if you think that IH
shade matched myself correctly but
that's what I'm thinking
so I'm gonna go ahead and wash all this
off and I'll be right back
alright we are back so let's go ahead
and do skin smoothing on my right side
which is the left side of your screen
and then we'll do the illuminating on
the other side now because I have normal
skin I just kind of put my primer
everywhere because this is supposed to
be line minimizing I'm going to Pat and
press it into the skin where if it was
just like a regular primer that didn't
claim to do that then I would probably
just rub it but we want to make sure
we're getting the best out of this so so
far I don't really see any kind of skin
smoothing effect let me go ahead and
turn my face I don't see anything nope
nothing let's do the aluminized and see
if it is illuminating aluminized it's
probably illuminating isn't it mmm I
definitely see some shine here with this
one this one feels different too it
feels more lotion II yeah they all have
that same kind of set it's not super
strong but if you are sensitive to
scents you probably won't like this it's
like they took chemicals and it didn't
smell so good and they put flowers on
top of them that's what it smells like
to me but it's not super strong but if
you are sensitive to scents you probably
won't like this alright let's go ahead
and apply Ziff foundation and I'm gonna
do two pumps I don't like putting on a
lot of my a lot of foundation I know a
lot of people on YouTube put on you know
four five
it's a foundation and it's like I don't
like the way that makes my skin look
that's just me personally and that's a
lot of foundation so we're just gonna do
two pumps and we'll see how that looks
that's what I used yesterday and this
right here is a Marc Jacobs brush this
is called the face it's specifically
made for foundation and I really like it
I've used this brush for years and I'm
finding that this foundation goes on a
little bit streaky with it so maybe a
Beauty Blender or something of that sort
some kind of beauty sponge might blend
it a little bit better because this is
going on quite streaky not sure if you
can see it zoomed up but on this side
which was aluminized side I feel like
it's breaking up a little bit where the
smoothing side I feel like it's not
breaking up can you see that right there
I'm hoping my camera will be able to
pick it up but yeah mmm I don't know
about that we'll put on some powder and
we'll see how it is let's come back in a
second okay so we've now applied we like
you're here doing it with me well you
kind of are but you weren't here for
that part so it wasn't we it was me I
just applied the number-3 medium in the
multitasker face powder by Milani to
both sides so let's go ahead and zoom in
and kind of look and see what we're
dealing with here remember this is the
skin smoothing side and then this is the
Luminizer side now to my naked eye I can
see just a tad bit more luminosity on
this side but I don't think it's enough
for anybody that isn't up close
scrutinizing the face to be able to see
the luminosity of it I feel like this
foundation is meant to be matte and I
feel like the matte of the foundation is
definitely overpowering the luminizing
primer at least as of now we'll have to
see how it wears through the day I'm not
gonna wear any concealer today because I
don't want I want you to be able to see
how the foundation reacts under my eyes
and I put another product under my eyes
then you it might be changing that well
it would change that completely so we'll
just go with foundation all over the
face now so I'm gonna go ahead and do
the rest of my makeup and I will be
back so we are back I have my full face
on let's go ahead and zoom in so you can
just see how the rest of my face looks
with full makeup on this is actually a
double day for me as far as where Tess
I'm also testing the new Depot 2d
palette by Laura Lee's it is currently
what time is it it is 3:00 o'clock right
now let me show you proof proof receipt
it's 3:00 o'clock so would be back at
the end of the day to check and see how
the foundation wore and yeah I'm excited
to show you hopefully it wears well over
this primer so I'll take a little break
but I will see you in a couple seconds
which will be at the end of the day for
me hello my friend we are back and it's
time to check in on the foundation now
from my eyes I think it looks pretty
good but I'm curious to know what you
think I'm gonna zoom in real close so
remember this is the smoothing side and
this is the luminous side I think
everything looks really good I feel like
I've still got that medium coverage on
where yesterday when I didn't have
primer on it definitely faded down to a
light coverage by this time in the night
I mean it's been eight hours it's about
11:30 at night ish and I'm actually
really impressed with how well the
primers worked I mean I know I had a
little bit of kind of I'm not sure about
this with the aluminized primer but it
really does look nice I don't see any
caking around my chin one thing I see
sometimes is foundation that cakes up
into my wrinkles up here but nothing
there I mean it just looks it looks good
I I admit it it looks really good
so for me at this point this is
definitely a recommend I am really
excited about this foundation especially
at a drugstore a price I like the finish
of it I like the coverage of it I like
the lasting power and I'm eating weird
funky going on I do have normal skin so
what happens with me may be different
for you if you have dry or combo or oily
skin but it really worked very well for
me one thing I did want to show you real
quick was the dry down blended swatches
I did do along with the fix watches I
did some that were blended with a
concealer brush it
one reason why I didn't do that for my
Instagram post was because my friend
summer who's been a community member in
the group for a really really long time
she was talking and rightly so about my
natural skin tone possibly coming
through on a blended swatch which makes
perfect sense but because I have a
neutral undertone I'm hoping that these
swatches will still be helpful and since
I did do them I figured I would show
them to you so this was done with uh
Sephora concealer brush and you can see
that the tones tend to look a lot more
similar when they're blended out a
little more so I thought that was really
really interesting I noticed it
especially with the medium shades that
they just looked really similar I
thought that was kind of odd but in the
thicker swatches you can definitely tell
a difference and we could tell the
difference on my face on the swatches so
I don't know I don't know what's going
on but hopefully you'll be able to find
your shade somewhere in here I do feel
like they tried with the deep two light
shades where they completely miss was
the fair shades there's nothing for my
pale princesses out there I felt like it
broke my heart when I saw that there
were these really light shades but then
when they were swatched it was like
where-where's from a pale girls what's
going on here so I'm glad they hit a lot
of people but unfortunately they still
missed an entire group of people which
made me really sad so maybe one day
they'll extend it to 50 shades and
include the true porcelain but that's
really my biggest complaint I like it I
mean I personally prefer a little more
dewy of a finish but that's really a
personal preference thing I don't feel
like the matte is so mad that it makes
me look like I'm wearing a mask it's not
a cakey foundation in any way I also
really love that there's a pump on here
and because there is a pump on here I
feel very comfortable donating these to
project Beauty share which is where all
of these products are going to go and
also a lot of the products that were
sent to me from covergirl in the
previous PR box the eyeshadow palette
that I didn't use the concealer palette
the face products all of those will be
donated to project Beauty share along
with all these foundations now that I
have reviewed them for you this will be
my first official donation to project
Beauty share
I'm sure there will be many more if
you'd like to know more about project
beauty share I will leave information
down below my acquaintances Taylor over
at that Tayla she is very very involved
with that program and they donate makeup
to people who are trying to get up on
their feet sometimes a little bit of
makeup can really help someone feel a
little bit better about themselves maybe
make them feel more professional going
into a job interview things like that so
it does make a huge difference so that's
why I'll be donating all of this stuff
to them I want to take a minute to thank
