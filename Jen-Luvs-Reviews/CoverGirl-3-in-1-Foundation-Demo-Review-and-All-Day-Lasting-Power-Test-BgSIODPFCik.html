agent which you don't if you don't know
a buzz agent is I'll link the
information down below it's kind of like
Influenster where they send you stuff to
ask you to review it so I got this
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation there are some things that I
really like about this foundation and
some things that I don't like as much
but I want you to kind of see how it all
works and then at the end of the day I
will give you my conclusions on what I
think event and you can make your own
decisions about what you think of it
first let me tell you what it claims it
claims it as an all day flawless
coverage lasting power of a primer
coverage of a concealer and the blend
ability of a foundation in one and also
that it is shine free which is very
interesting so let me show you the
consistency of it so it is quite thick
it drips a little bit but it's
definitely way way WAY thicker than the
Revlon nearly naked I mean that stuff
just goes and falls like right down your
hand yeah so we're gonna test this out
we're you an all day wear test and we're
gonna see how it goes
so first I'm going to show you
application last person that I saw do
this was what sets Beauty Emily she is
amazing she does fantastic she does
fantastic reviews and tutorials and all
that good stuff so I'm going to just put
this little bit on my hands and I'm
gonna blop blop blop blop blop blup look
look look look look and I only use one
pump for this because I feel like my
skin doesn't really need that much
coverage I do have normal skin I don't
have oily skin
don't have dry skin very I like my skin
my skin is very easy to deal with
I do get breakouts sometimes but not
very often
dark circles under my eyes are pretty
much the only thing that I don't like
about my skin my wrinkles starting to
get some wrinkles you know yet 34 and
wrinkles start coming but it's not too
bad yet um I feel like at this point it
is quite showing 3 I am going to use a
powder to set it I just don't feel
comfortable going to work without a
powder I don't know what that is but the
only I don't like about this is I don't
blend very well it'll get a little cakey
under my eyes I have to make sure I
blend it really nicely under my eyes
how's it looking ladies all right I'm
gonna go do the rest of the full face
and I'll be right back
here's the final look that I came up
with for today I'm kind of running a
little late because of the camera setup
and all that so I got naked too on my
eyeballs on my cheeks I'm using the
bones down boy for our bronzer I'm using
my little mini Laura Mercier golden
mosaic oh my gosh this thing is gorgeous
love this got this Christmas time and
the Sephora something glow something
glow set eyebrows
Anastasia highlight the my little mini
lorac that I got in that kit and when
those things come out you gotta go
because they're amazing this is the
perfectly lit from lorac oh and brow gel
from Anastasia for lips I've got let's
see what is this Maybelline Color
sensational in tinted taupe I don't know
where they get taupe out of this thing
but you know this doesn't look like
taupe to me but what that looks like
that's what that looks like that's the
tinted taupe and then for gloss I use
the NYX butter gloss in Terry gave me
sue
and then mascara used the Dior curling
mascara your show I kind of Oh powder
very important and powder I use my
Rimmel stay matte hopefully you know
maybe this foundation will do
differently with a different powder but
this is pretty popular one I think a lot
of people use this so I use this one and
we'll see
you have a foundation last over the day
here's what everything looks like my
dark circles are pretty cover pretty
happy with that I really feel like with
this foundation you really have to work
quickly it dries pretty fast especially
if you're not using a lot of it it's
like a medium to full coverage just kind
of like it's similar to the Revlon
Colorstay and so far so good we'll see
the lasting power test at the end of the
day and through the magic of video hi my
friends so it is now 2:30 give you a
look of how things are looking
I see a little bit of creasing going on
down here
and just feel like it's a little on the
cakey side just a little bit you know it
definitely doesn't look as perfect as it
did when I first put it on I feel like
it was gave me a lot more of a flawless
look
of course my lipsticks gone everything
else looks pretty decent though blush is
still there go the bomb but I will see
you in just a quick second which will be
this evening so all right ready here
comes the magic one two three
hello my friends so unfortunately I
didn't get to make this video until 9
o'clock at night and I don't know I
don't know of many foundations it will
last for I might 7:34 13 and a half
hours I mean I don't think it's really
fair at this point so all my freckles
are back my dark circles are back you
know I have no coverage at all anymore
but I will tell you that I feel like
this foundation holds its coverage for
about 4 hours before you start losing
some of it for I started getting creases
here before my freckles started showing
through I do not have blemishes I do not
have skin that has dark spots or
anything like that so I don't know how
it would work on skin like that but for
me I feel like you know that it really
doesn't even last 6 hours completely I
felt like at 8 hours they need my
freckles we're really starting to show
through my dark circles we're just
starting the show
and now 13 hours of course there's
nothing left so overall what I
repurchase this foundation I believe
that I would I do not feel like this is
as good as using a primer I feel like
this needs a primer in order to last as
long as foundation does when it does
have a primer coverage of concealer yes
until about four hours and then the
concealer pretty much goes away blend
ability of a foundation absolutely well
but then it didn't really doesn't really
blend around my eyes unless I really
really I got to really work at it to
blend under my eyes if I end up putting
on too much so I mean I do like the
foundation I don't want you get me wrong
I do like it I would probably repurchase
it but it's definitely not perfect it
definitely has its flaws and um yeah I
mean take away take away from it what
you will maybe some things are more
important to you than others and
hopefully this gives you an idea of
whether this is something you would want
to purchase or not alright I hope you
enjoyed that video mad love and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
