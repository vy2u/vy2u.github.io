filled one of these videos I got some
feedback about how it would be really
helpful if I gave just a little quick
summary about my thoughts about these
two products and so let me just tell you
a little bit about my day it was pretty
cold outside today a little bit windy
but it didn't sweat or anything I went
to my my nephew's birthday party and
then we drove home I cooked dinner like
I mean just a typical day nothing crazy
or outrageous I when I do a test like
this I don't purposely try not to touch
my face or anything because in real life
people we touch our face every once in a
while you know so I don't do anything
special I try to just forget that I'm
doing a hair test until it's time to do
the review so now as far as application
goes they applied exactly the same I
didn't see much difference as far as how
thickly they applied they the only thing
is the Lummi definitely had a little bit
more luminescence which makes sense
because it's the lumi but then as soon
as i put the powder on it was like they
were exactly the same like you could not
at least from my eyes could not tell the
difference now all zoomed up in the
camera like you saw we might be able to
see more of a difference I haven't seen
that yet so you probably know more than
I do at this point you know it's
definitely faded but I feel like it
still looks good I mean I feel like the
Physicians Formula side lasted just a
little bit longer than the l'oreal side
like now looking in the month I do have
a normal skin so I don't know how this
would work on a oily skin person or a
dry skin person but it's I don't think
it's enough for me to justify saying you
have to get this one over this one it's
not that big of a difference I feel like
with the looming I almost wish like I
think the next time I try this I'm gonna
try it without something like the Rimmel
stay matte like
I might just do like a finishing powder
over it just so I can keep that
luminescence because I think that's what
it's meant to be and I think I killed it
with the stay mat I am happy with both
of them do I think they're so
outstanding that you need to buy these
over top of a foundation that's seven or
eight dollars cheaper absolutely not I
don't feel like these are standout
products and don't feel like they're
products that you just must have if they
are fun to try and I definitely
recommend you try them if you're
interested in them but it's definitely
not one that I'm going to say you have
to go out and buy it if that makes sense
