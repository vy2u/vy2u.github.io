the four years that I have been on
YouTube so I think I need to throw some
of these away hello my friends welcome
to a very highly requested decluttering
video I haven't put up a lot of videos
this week and I just really wanted to
put something else up this week because
I feel bad only putting up four videos
including the weekly chat and what's it
been make up and then the 2 review
videos one and then it's five if you
count what's on my face on the website
but still I feel bad because I feel like
I'm gonna put up enough content this
week so we're gonna rock through this
decluttering I've never decluttered my
lip glosses in the four years that I
have been on YouTube so I think I need
to throw some of these away because you
know when you put a product into like
this you put on your lips and you put it
in I mean it gets gross and I've I know
I've had this particular lip gloss for
at least three years so a lot of this is
gonna have to get tossed and I feel
really really bad about that because I
hate wasting things but at this point
there's nothing I can do about it all I
can do is learn from my mistakes and be
more responsible next time so let's go
ahead and get into the decluttering I'm
gonna go ahead and move my microphone
over a little bit
alright I'm gonna dump this out oh my
goodness okay so the only way I'm
keeping anything is if I know that it is
it's never been used or if I know that
it's like like these squeezy tubes I
don't feel as bad keeping because I can
just clean off the tip and maybe the
expected dispense a but like a little
bit of product and it'll be okay so I'll
probably keep some of the squeezy tubes
if I like the formula but a lot of these
kinds of things are gonna have to get
thrown in the trash which makes me super
sad alright let's go ahead and get
started so like see like this I don't
even know what this is what even is this
like you can't oh it's Oprah this is an
oaf relicts
can you believe that oh we used to have
sticker packaging you can't even see it
anymore that's gross alright that's
getting decluttered okay
Delanie I don't think this has ever been
used let me see
yeah this has never been used this is
going to have this is going to get
so onto somebody cuz I will never use
the shade this has never been used
alright this formula I really like this
a lot this is the air whipped by Laura
Geller I don't think this is super old
but I really like it and it doesn't look
gross let me smell it it smells good
I'm gonna keep this one alright so put
that over in the key all right this I
know is super old this is the Napoleon
parody
I think it's parody paradis my friend
Lily sent this to me like two years ago
so that's gonna have to get thrown away
sorry Lily this is another Oprah I think
this is old doesn't yeah it smells a
little funky I think it's old Oh break
in my heart
alright this I'm gonna keep actually
really like this is the accurate lip
lush these are really nice I'm gonna
keep that this I don't think I've ever
used this is the tart looks like I've
used it a little bit I don't know how

where did that one go that was like the
glitter one I don't even know all right
this is Eve pearl this is about two
years old I don't know how much I've
used this it looks brand-new
okay I'm gonna keep that because I don't
think I've really used it much oh gosh I
don't know I don't know I'm scared
because if I used even once
two years ago it could have bacteria in
it it could be nasty I'm gonna get rid
of it oh that breaks my heart that's an
expensive product why didn't I go
through this earlier you know what I
really like this one this is Material

we've decluttered yeah for us let's show
you what we've done the damage we've
done so this is the 48 lip glosses that
I'm throwing away and my heart is crying
with all the waste and I feel horrible
but it's a lesson that I've learned to
keep up better with this stuff I'm
keeping what did I count 34 lip glosses
and I'm passing on six lip glosses if I
could pass more on I would this isn't
something that I can really share and
those are all bad and it's just killing
me so but I am so keeping some I don't
think I need any lip glosses for a very
long time and I'm happy with the ones
that I'm keeping and happy that I'm able
to keep a significant number with once
