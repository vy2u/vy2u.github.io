go over the do your holiday palette for
you now I wanted to love this and I
don't love it and let me tell you why I
don't love it but I will also want to
tell you who I think may love this
because it may just be for like my
personal preferences and there may be
people that this is a good fit for and
I'm gonna kind of go into that alright
so this is how the box comes and says do
your holiday couture collection it says
multi look palette face eyes and lips
and then it has a picture on the back
here is the front and here is the back
and the first sight is called glow look
which is the Browns and then smoky look
which is the Grays it also comes with
this little book and it's in many
languages
now all women can benefit from runway
expertise create two customized
professional makeup results with this
multi look pilot either natural or more
sophisticated to suit your mood and then
it tells you how to apply the
highlighter and then it shows you how to
apply the eye looks and it says that the
brown has a base and then the color and
then a highlighter and then the gray is
a base a color and then a liner and then
it says apply the lipstick finish with
the touch of lip gloss now my first
complaint about this is the packaging on
the outside you can see I've used this
maybe five or six times and it is
already getting very dirty it has kind
of a faux leather outside but it's not I
don't know it's like I don't really get
almost it's like it's trying to be
leather but it's not really leather I
don't know if that makes sense
it is relatively light the zipper does
seem to be a pretty good quality and for
do you wear it kind of expects it will
be when you get this it does come with
this really nice mirror at the top and
then there are your products inside let
me show you kind of what's in here and
I'm going to swatch everything for you
what they've done here is they've
created two different looks they've
created a brown look and a gray look for
you you've got the three eyeshadows on
each side a lipstick and a lip
los and the center is your highlighter
you've got the door over curling mascara
here then you've got a lip brush and
some eyeshadow a little spongy guys
there which I was I was a little
surprised I would get spongy guys from
newer but you know whatever so as you
might be able to notice um there isn't
it's not a very impressive color
selection there to say the least
I think what they meant for this to do
was what this would be your lid color
this would be your crease color and then
this will be your brow bone now the lid
color is very nice the crease color when
you put them on together there isn't
much contrast between the lid color and
the crease color so what you end up with
is just a very very light daytime look
now this one of course you might be able
to hopefully you can see the sparkles in
there it's just straight glitter it
doesn't not have fallout though which is
very very nice to not have the fallout
but if you're not interested in glitter
this may not be a shadow for you my
biggest complaint about this side is
just that it's creates such a plain look
there isn't a lot of dimension to it
there isn't a whole lot going on and
it's just I don't know I just wasn't
impressed with this color selection at
all for those three shades well we'll go
onto the other side I'm actually wearing
the gray side today okay so let me show
you the way i swatched these the reason
why i'm swatching them close together so
you can see kind of how they will apply
to the eye so there's the light this is
supposed to be the lid color I believe
this is the crease color and then this
is like a defining color I did separate
them a little bit for you so you can see
what they look like a little more
separated if that's too close for you so
you can get an idea I did like this much
better I did like the quality of the
shadows they're creamy they blend very
nicely very very high quality really
enjoyed these the black is not as
pigmented but that's kind of nice if
you're using it as a defining color
because then it really blends well into
the other colors but this is not a super
pigmented black if you're looking for
that kind of look now let me tell you a
little bit about the lips now now one
thing I don't like about this is that
the more you use the shadows you're
gonna create some fallout inside the
container here especially and with the
highlight which the
can fall into the lip product and the
last thing you want is some black
eyeshadow in your berry colored lip so I
don't like that these have no protection
I don't think it would have been that
difficult to make this a little bit
larger and then put a little door over
top or some kind of pull down or
something some kind of little spring
released door that might lift up so that
it protects the lip products from the
shadows my other complaint is the size
of the pans for the lip gloss they're
just too small to get in there to really
get the product out there is a swatch
for this one here's the lip gloss you
can't see that without one's completely
clear here's the lip stick on that side
and not pigmented hardly all and then
that one is completely clear so these
are the two colors that are under the
gray side these are the two colors that
are under the brown side it was really
hard to get them to apply to my lips I
had to swatch then rub then swatch then
rub I tried to use the little lip brush
that came with it that was not
functional just the pans are just too
small to really get in there and get the
product out and it was very
disappointing I would have much rather
have liked either some square size pans
would have been nice or if they had been
a little mini like little lip products
where I could actually take out and then
apply it that would have been nice but
in this form I did not enjoy those and
those colors are okay if you can get
them to apply the lip glosses they're
just glosses I there there's nothing
spectacular in my mind about them the
other thing about lipstick in the pan
like this is that unless you're gonna
take this with you you're not going to
be able to reapply so that's something I
don't like about this the next thing I
want to show you is the highlight and it
is a gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
highlight it is a champagne just
absolutely beautiful very buttery very
creamy goes on very smooth absolutely
love it but let me show you something
that's really funny if you're a makeup
junkie you know what this is this is
mary lou manizer by the balm and it is
many many many people's Holy Grail
highlighter champagne colored check this
out
hmm
hmm this is the Dior and this is the
mary-lou manizer I'm pretty sure that's
an exact dupe what do you think exact
dupe I think so the last little thing in
here is the Dior iconic over curling
mascara and it is a sample I will show
you the brush it is kind of shaped like
an eye I did look everywhere online
trying to figure out the correct way to
apply this Here I am applying this with
the curved side facing my lashes I
couldn't remember which was the correct
way so that's one way and that's what
one coat looks like and here is with two
coats let me show you the other side now
this is with it facing in the other
direction with it facing with the
rounder side up this mascara is supposed
to have results if you continue to use
it your lashes are supposed to naturally
curl and they're also supposed to get
natural volume in them
just from using this mascara daily now I
have not used this mascara daily so I
cannot speak to the claims of that but I
do I I don't think that I would purchase
this overall I feel like this may work
for someone that wants just it is not a
makeup junkie that they just want
something to use every day to create
everyday makeup looks very casual stuff
for work people that aren't worrying
about highly pigmented lip products
because you're not it's gonna take some
work to get that on there people that
don't own a highlighter and really want
a nice highlighter but overall I'm just
not impressed this this was $85 and I
really really truly feel that this is
the epitome of buying something for the
name if you want to spend $85 on some
Dior then sure if you're paying want to
pay for a doer but there's much much
better pallets and packages and sets
this holiday season that are much more
they're cheaper than this they're more
worth the value and I do not
to mend this one unless you are the kind
of person that I spoke about just a
moment ago or if you know someone that
is that type of person just so you know
this is going back to the store as soon
as I can get the Sephora thank you so
