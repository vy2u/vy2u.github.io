can we test out Korean beauty products
to decide whether they're worth your
time and money today we are not testing
a Korean beauty product we are testing a
Chinese beauty product that may save you
a lot of money on your Korean face masks
it is the kingdom cares face mask maker
and Lila is joining me today she's my 9
year old and she is actually going to be
making the masks and trying it out for
you so if you're curious about this mask
maker and how it works we're gonna tell
you in just a second you may have seen
this on Facebook that's how I found out
about it I had some subscribers contact
me on Facebook and say Jen could you do
a review of this and I was like yes we
can definitely do that so the brand that
you can order it from it's called
creative shop and so I ordered it
directly from creative shop like three
weeks later I realized that they had
sent me a shipping confirmation and I
had never received the product it was
$75 and I kind of started freaking out
because when I checked my email the
website where it says check to check on
your order or whatever it says it's no
longer in service the link to the
website for the company no longer in
service so I go back to Facebook and to
make a long story short they ended up
refunding my money through PayPal so I
do not recommend that you go through
creative shop that is the people that
were advertising through I think it was
inside something I forgot what the ad
was through or whether they just talked
about it or whatever but anyway don't go
through creative shop I got mine through
Amazon directly from Kingdom cares
it was $45.99 through them right now it
looks like it's sold out but I don't see
why they wouldn't restock it's probably
just a really popular item there are
tons of these kinds of makers and
reviews for them on YouTube so if you
don't want to wait for them to get it
back in stock you can probably find
another similar machine somewhere else
because these are all over you - but I
thought $45.99 was a really good price
so forty or forty five dollars nine
you get the machine you also get a
juicer and the juicer it makes so you
can juice all kinds of things and it
comes with a measuring little cup thing
here which is great it comes with a
spatula this is for prying the mask out
it comes with a brush for cleaning and
then it comes with this for your face so
that's what the mask actually kind of 3d
prints sheet masks it's super neat
shades yeah well we'll see what happens
because I tried it out on my own without
her just to make sure it worked before
we filmed the video but she hasn't seen
it work yet so I'm excited for her to
see it it also comes with these collagen
pills and the information back here is
from China I thought it was Korean so I
asked my friend sue on on Twitter if she
could translate this for me and she was
like oh Jen that's Chinese I can't I
can't speak Chinese only translate
Korean but she gave me the advice to
download an app and and kind of get it
translated from there so I did find out
what was in it sue actually has a
YouTube channel I will link that down
below in case you're interested but
anyway the number one ingredient in this
is a binder and the second one is
hydrolyzed collagen these are considered
collagen pills I'm going to show you
what they look like now one thing to
keep in mind about collagen is that
collagen from what I researched it only
helps you with the outermost layers of
your skin it doesn't really help you
replace the collagen within your skin
this is what it looks like the second
ingredient besides the collagen is aloe
extract which I really like to see in in
cosmetics it of course is we know that
aloe is cooling for sunburn but also can
treat acne it's a moisturizer it's
actually a really nice ingredient it
comes with 12 college until was in the
pack so it doesn't come with a lot
you're gonna need to buy more pills if
you're gonna use more than 12 of these
so I wasn't sure if it was gonna come
with the pills because it wasn't listed
on the website whether it was pain with
pills so I actually got these as an
extra because I wasn't sure I didn't
want to end up with no pills because you
need the pill in order to make the mask
this is an effervescent mask pill it's
the same thing but it says effervescent
and the major ingredients in this are
something called tartaric acid which
tartaric ass
as an antioxidant for the skin it's an
alpha hydroxy acid and then glucomannan
glucomannan and that's an anti-aging
ingredient and I will put more
information about those ingredients down
below if you're interested in these this
pack was $25.99 and you get 32 pieces
today we're just making what yes we are
we're gonna do a watermelon face mask
and watermelon you were seeing more in
skincare ingredients with watermelon the
reason why it's red is because of
something called lycopene and lycopene
is a good skin care ingredient
apparently it also has amino acids it
has vitamin A vitamin b6 vitamin C
watermelon is a really good ingredient
to put in these I'm going to put in the
description box below a bunch of other
fruits and vegetables and things that
you may want to use this with there are
and it tells you what the benefits are
but you know me I've gotta like dig a
little deeper so we'll put some of those
suggestions but all diggings are and put
some more information in the description
box so you kind of can target what
you're looking for so now we have gotten
through everything in here let's go
ahead and make a mask now while oh I
kind of gave her a project what was the
project open
yeah we I we had the hardest time
figuring out how to open a stupid thing
so how does it work
but you have their safety my opponents
he had to push this down then you press
the button there you go and inside is a
little plastic blade that mixes it and
it heats so Lyla how do we make this
mask can you look at the directions and
tell us how we make it okay so the first
thing we need to do is okay prepare the
fruit so we're going to put zip roots in
zip up put it on there but let's just
put two in for now and then I'm gonna
hold this and you smoosh excuse me
yep smoosh stand up get some get some
leverage there you go and it's kind of
spin it and turn it and smush it yeah
get it get it yeah just push it up I'm
just gonna go
oh hey go ahead and smoosh there you go
that's actually probably enough juice
number two take purified water or warm
water to clean the stirring tank which I
already did so we're good there prepare
1 inch piece of collagen so that's the
pill you're wired and how much how much
water 60 milliliters leave it 60
milliliters and how much juice and 20
milliliters of juice okay so go fill
this up with 60 milliliters of warm
water
I would imagine purified water is
probably better but I don't have anybody
that keeps purified water in their house
and if they have a specific reason to so
we don't have that so we're just going
to use warm water today
my microphone was showing go to straddle
it's 9 o'clock 60 milliliters of water
now if I add 20 milliliters of water
into this how many milliliters should we
have altogether so can you pour that in
it so we have 80 milliliters of liquid
whoa it's okay it went out of there
oops okay and collagen pill drop it in
drop it in donk donk and there's a
little bit of fizz ease going on yeah it
goes from numbers 1 2 3 and then 2 2 3
and then numbers 1 2 5
I don't really get this this microphone
keeps falling down in my face pour the
prepared materials towards the stirring
tank close the lock catch cover the wall
catch pepper oh that's ok all right here
you go oh so go ahead and pour that into
the machine here yep right in yeah
that's correct though we're it all in
okay and close it up
turn turn the latch close it close the
latch now we're gonna plug it in you
want to make sure you plug it in after
they say it does have a relatively short
cord so we have an extension cord that
we're gonna use licking noises beep beep
press the power switch to turn on the
appliance pressing ok yep press the
button it's pretty cool uh-huh we need
to wait about six minutes after hearing
the beats down for reminder properly on
the plug the plug and press the lock
catch to open a lot of patch covers okay
so we will see you in six minutes when
this thing is done you can hear that it
is quite quiet you can hear the noise
but it's not very loud and it does have
a nice decently loud beep that tells you
when it is done so we will see you after
it beeps it has just beeped we are good
to go
it says what pour out the liquid mask
toward the mask mold and wait about
fitting masks to cool down and connects
okay so what we're gonna do here is I'm
actually gonna do the pouring because it
is hot and I don't want Lila
accidentally burn herself open this up
and we are going to gently pour and it
is very hot hopefully you can see the
steam so that is how the mask looks
right now I found that the last time
that I did this two minutes was not long
enough it was still very warm so it
actually takes about 10 minutes for it
to completely cool down enough to be
able to lift it off so we're gonna wait
8 to 10 minutes and we'll be back we
have our face mask yes when the mask is
condensed take the scraper and gently
pull the mask away so kind of run it
around the outer edges just slice it
around there you go and I gently lift it
up with your fingers and then you're
gonna plop it on your face there you go
hold up so they can see and then plop it
on your face not that she needs collagen
or anything but how's it feel today yeah
does it smell like watermelon yes so
you're supposed to leave this on 15 to
20 minutes Lila doesn't have time for
that because it's her bedtime
you look creepy when you have a regular
Korean mask they'll say to you know wipe
in the rest of it but they actually
recommend you rinse off the ingredients
when you're done and I definitely
recommend that with water bond because
it does feel sticky afterward but I felt
like my skin looks pretty nice after
I've used ed I did I really enjoyed it
so what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna
go ahead and put her to bed and then
we're gonna come back
I'm just gonna quickly make another one
of these but I'm gonna use the
effervescent one just to see if it's any
different and then I will give you my
final thoughts on this product all right
the children are in bed hopefully they
stay there oh my gosh I forgot to tell
you this is my dining room by the way I
just have no good table in my filming
room so I figured this would be a better
place to do this and that way if
anything spilled or anything
we'd be in good shape so let's pick up
where we left off I have remixed some
watermelon juice with the warm water and
we're gonna go ahead and drop in an
effervescent Math tab in case you want
to try this these are specifically made
for face mask machines all right so
we're gonna go ahead and drop that in
bunk and we're going to open this baby
up bunk and we're gonna pour in be
prepared liquid bunk close it up
start it up so we'll wait until this
beeps and then we'll pour it out and
we'll see if it's any different than the
collagen mask I don't usually have my
microphone above my head I usually have
it below me but there's no room so it
keeps falling down it's like creeping
down on my head like stop creeping on me
microphone my machine went off so I'm
going to oh I forgot to latch it oh so
it will work without it being latched
just so you know and I'm going to pour
into here and it looks the same I'm
gonna go ahead and let this mask cool
and I'm gonna put it on and tell you if
it feels any different than the other
one that I did the other day so we have
our mask it is totally cool let's go
ahead and scrape it off put it on and
see if I notice any difference then with
the collagen mask I really was expecting
it to be a little more effervescent
considering it is an effervescent mask
it seems to be the exact same as far as
the thickness goes the way it feels and
plop mmm
so I am going to leave this on my face
for 20 minutes ten minutes ten minutes
and I'll take it off and I'll tell you
if it feels I'll tell you if it feels
any different than the collagen one okay
those are juicy juicy and watermelon II
I think I'm gonna need to lay down with
this one cuz it's sliding oh he imagined
don't put lemon juice in this because I
would imagine that would hurt the eyes
that it would get in your eyes don't put
lemon juice in one of these imagine
that'd be a terrible idea
all right well you got okay so I have
some things and stuff and stuff and
things to tell you all right first of
all it does feel the same but I did have
an issue dab my face off a little bit I
did have an issue in that as I was
laying down on the couch letting the
mask kind of seep into my face it was
like random drips running down my neck
so if you have like strawberry juice or
blueberry juice or like something that
can stain be super super careful because
the juice was absolutely dripping down
my neck and it was at random times I
know I got a little bit on my shirt here
thankfully it was just watermelon juice
but still so definitely be careful with
that it might have been like the ratio
of because watermelon is so juicy I
don't know I didn't do exactly what they
said with the 20 milliliters and the 60
milliliters so I don't know but I'm
definitely gonna have to play with that
formula a little bit so final thoughts
on this I definitely I don't know I mean
I feel like this would be a great thing
for people that really like cooking
people that like creating people that
you know maybe make their own handmade
soaps or you know people that are really
into that whole I'm gonna make my own of
something because it makes it very easy
for you to make your own but I do warn
you to please look into the ingredients
you're planning on putting in there and
if you put something in and it doesn't
feel right take it off immediately you
get 32 pieces for 26 dollars so that's
less than a dollar
he'll and mostly most face masks the
least expensive ones are like $1 so
you're paying less than $1 for each one
it was so much fun to use it was so easy
to use cleanup is a little bit tricky in
that you have to make sure that you
clean this out really good you're
supposed top water in here and let it
cook and then kind of you're supposed to
use the brush and scrub it out and kind
of rub it out it is a little bit hard to
get inside but I think that it's gonna
be okay I don't feel like this is
something that's gonna be super
difficult to keep clean but I've only
used it twice so I'll have to keep you
posted on that and all I had any
additional information if there's
anything more I'll put it in the
description as I learn it I mean feel
like enjoying this product and so much
fun for masks lovers out there as you
know I used to hate face masks now I
really enjoy them so yeah this was a fun
project for me and I definitely
recommend it so I want to thank you so
