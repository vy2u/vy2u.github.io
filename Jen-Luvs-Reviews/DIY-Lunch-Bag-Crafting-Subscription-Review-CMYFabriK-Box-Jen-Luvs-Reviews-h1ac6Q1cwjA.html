my fabric books oh I am so nervous about
this box because I am NOT a crafty
talented kind of person like that's not
my thing I am NOT a crafter I'm not a
DIY I am terrible at following
directions so when when see my fabric
contacted me and asked me to review this
box I shared my concerns with them and
they said no problem actually it'll make
it awesome to have someone that's not as
good at crafting do this box and this is
the deal with this subscription you get
a either so or no sew project to do
every mom tweezers Oh
subscription information all that will
be down below and again I did receive
this for review so I did not pay for it
but does not influence my review at all
so this is what it looks like on the
inside it says let's get craft and craft
it follow the instructions for a cute
and easy project or throw them away and
make something even better and oh my
gosh I'm so nervous okay because I don't
wanna look like an idiot
like not being able to do that whole
thing looks like inside oh my goodness
okay so this is what is it okay so this
it's a sticker and it says a stitching
good time and then there's this Fabrice
little bag here okay inside here is a
seam ripper and what is this you crafty
people are gonna be laughing at me oh
and little scissors and this just come
in the subscription box this isn't like
just for me this comes in a subscription
box that's kind of cool and then what is
this OH needles Oh what did I get myself
into and then there's a pin cushion with
pins and some string here this is
industrial-strength adhesive and some
because string I guess and some tape is
this is this called washi tape is that
what this is called to help me out here
and then a measuring tape and a little
button okay where are the directions
there's no direction
why - okay I'm confused I'm very
confused
there's no directions anywhere on what
to do with these things what it makes
there's no picture there's nothing
nothing I don't know
did I miss something here like is it on
the back of the car no no we're gonna
pause this video and we're gonna come
back on another day I know that's weird
but I've got to talk to them and find
out what's going on up yeah we'll be
back on another day to see what's going
on with us alright see you soon oh no I
like your highlight is poppin it looks
good hmmm alright hello my friends and
welcome to the update on the see my
fabric box okay so the last time I saw
you I was a bit confused because there
were no directions in the box well I
contacted the wonderful people over at
see my fabric and they told me that all
of their directions are in video formats
so what I did was I went and I tried to
film this video and I realized I didn't
have an iron
I lost my iron sometime when I moved so
I'm calling in reinforcements this is my
friend Sandra who I met on the whatsapp
and makeup app and now we are good
friends and she is a crafter so she came
over with her wonderful irony to help me
with myself I got fabric box because I
realized this might be quite difficult
for me as a person who doesn't craft so
we'll see how much she has to help me
and how much I can do myself
um are you ready for the challenge yes
yeah let's do it before we get started
so when I tried to film this before I
got a little frustrated and I ended up
leaving the box on the floor and then my
dog got a hold of it so we lost some of
the original things that you saw in the
beginning of this video including the
beautiful scissors that have now been
chewed and let's show you what's left of
the pin cushion yes and the cute little
bag yes thank you Sam for that
appreciate it so we're gonna go with
what we've got and we've got my scissors
but and you got this box they would send
the scissors but I've got maligning
because of my dog and then here are the
materials so we're gonna go ahead and
start laying everything out and get
stores and what do you think about this
fabric sandra it probably easy to work
with because of the stripes if we have
to cut or line up I think that's that's
a good print for that alright what I
want to do is flip it over because if
that is a printed on I'm do it is a
printed on print I want to press it on
the back and the first thing you do with
all sewing projects as you press the
fabric
this part is not in the directions that
they sent it's just kind of what sign
Sandra is kind of like giving me the
courtesy of teaching me to do this that
we probably should press it first I
would not have done that if it hadn't
been for her alright so we're going to
go ahead and start watching the video
now and see what we are supposed to do
with this okay so she's cutting the
fabric pieces and this part is annotated
if you were on a computer then you'll be
able to see the annotation of how big to
cut it we found out from the directions
that we need to do two pieces that are
eight by twelve two pieces that are five
by twelve and one piece that's five by
eight well when we looked at it it
doesn't really the piece that they sent
us doesn't really divide evenly among
those but when we measured the fabric we
see that this is eight inches here to
this point and they've got this really
nice line here so we thought that would
be a great place to cut it so that's
where we're gonna go ahead and cut our
eight by twelve pieces I'm going to
suggest making a modification because
it's only one inch longer just fold in
half and that way we don't have any
leftover and we don't have like a
strength left oh okay I know you have to
make one cut here I'm gonna press it
first why are you pressing it so we can
cut on that line so okay so be easier to
cut you'll know where the line is that's
a good idea
just folded it right in and I would have
thought to do that it would be great if
they included a marker or a marking
pencil or marketing chalk some kind of
marking something how about eyeliner
okay can we use eyeliner yes
okay let's use eyeliner
Birchbox help us out yeah so it's not
quite long enough I just got that piece
okay but I'm gonna use this as a
straight edge you see it
so I have straightedge yes which I think
I like perhaps well and in the video she
used that fancy cutter it was a rotary
cutter yes I underlined there I'm gonna
cut this piece because we need it to
five by two a little bit longer
okay can you snap right there I'm hot
guys okay so we've got our two 8 by 12
pieces well now they're 9 by 12 because
we just kept them as the fabric was and
we figure we'll just trim them down if
we have to we to 5 by 12 and 1 5 by 8
okay so I'm gonna use this edge because
this is our 12 inch length ah less mark
and I want to make another adjustment
here because you can see that I want to
use that line as a guide and it's only
one more inch well they made everything
else one more inch we think so oh one
more inch with this because it would
just make cutting easier let's do that
so do you want to cut now you think I
don't know right let's keep it rollin
Sandra you got this girlfriend
okay so we've got those pieces in a
meeting and they wanted one more on fly
by eight I guess that's the bottom of
the bag I think these are the size yeah
did I mention yet that this is gonna be
a lunch bag I don't know if I did know I
don't know much about got plenty of
fabric so please and writing it would
always cut another piece so that's nice
that they included some extra fabric
it's not exactly
so now let's go ahead and put back to
the video and we'll watch and see what
we're supposed to be doing next Oh with
the glue part okay go back one say they
had the big piece okay so I'm gonna move
these pieces there Jeremy want one of
these yeah and we want one of these okay
so she's blowing the bigger piece with
the smaller piece she's got the press
and then she ya lays them like that okay
now one thing I think that would be
really helpful Sandra would have been if
they had put it in text underneath like
put a little text thing that said lay
down the larger fabric with the print
side up and then a smaller piece
whatever the the 5 by 12 piece laid on
top you know print side down like I'm a
person that appreciates both the picture
and the text so she used a glue gun
they've also provided this blue so I'm
assuming they're expecting us to use
this glue and because this is the no sew
version
okay let's see what happens
looks like they get to them so did you
want the other side oh yeah okay so
let's stop there right so now so they've
grabbed the other one so it would be
this way right yes those two open unless
you use me holy moly so see the glues
gettin to me I'm getting a little loopy
here Sandra on All Right see I need I
need Sandra to come in the box and then
we'll be good it's one Sandra and every
box
so now let's see what we're supposed to
do next so now it just went really fast
oh wow okay let's rewind that rewind
that because I did not get that you
should push it
zoom it alright it's okay we have to
turn it around like I said well what was
those sides okay short side long side
okay he'll ventilated area for this glue
we're gonna both on the floor by the end
of this video she's blue cutting the
bottom of the loop long one okay I'm
excited she's doing okay the long okay
okay corresponds okay I'm opening it up
she's got the print side up and then
she's fold she's put what I want to do
here like this and this is where I think
we have an inch too much notice here
because we yes you need the seems to
match right so we have an inch too much
and I want to I want to press these
scenes because that's how you
I want to fold this back oh no oh no it
wasn't stuck yet oh it wasn't just
Thursday in any period I guess so
okay here yes you need to fix that
it would be nice also in the directions
to know how long we needed to wait for
the good or I maybe it says here oh my
goodness this product contains the
chemical known to the state of
California cost cancer but smells good
morning vapor harmful possible cancer
agents cause kidney damage let's open
the door this is serious
oh my gosh this job this YouTube thing
is gonna kill me literally it's gonna
kill my friend too thanks see my fabric
so we we cut this a little too long so
we got it we got to trim this baby down
by an ant right yes but I want to make
sure I know where the seams are so I
just want to press them open or did she
line up the seat okay okay see that it's
open okay so it's just exact
yes okay so it's just right seem to seem
okay so I guess we have to term it
because I'm cry do you want to cut this
yep
you know what can we earn that so I know
where to cut on the line and then that
way I don't mess it up
just give it a pinch I'm tired because I
know it's just a pinch I can see where
the pinch is I doubt that I can cut
things
and then now she's okay okay so now
she's gluing so that those stick
together so I think we need to wait a
second for this to dry right so
hopefully this will stay together I'm a
little concerned that it's gonna fall
apart as soon as I put a banana in there
but you'll see we'll see what happens
I'm hoping that it'll be fine and since
its fabric I would assume that you do
want to wash it every once in a while
yeah I don't know what they're gonna
hold up I guess we have to be
hand-washed
so there we go so let's watch the next
step so we think that when she folded it
did you see that really quick no I
didn't see it
because they leave one side open okay so
now we need to do and I think they did
the long side she might did worksite
like yep this was it the long sides that
she just didn't oh thank you no no it
would be nice if they kept it as the
original speed even though it'll make
the video longer that would be really
helpful I think it's not measuring up
it's too long so we have to figure out
how much to trim it so that it can go
inside and I'm just trying to get an
idea of what the shape will look like so
that if we don't cuz that's the thing
about crafting that bothers me like
makeup you can always put more on or
blend it out or whatever with crafting
you cut something too much you're done
that's the end of it I can't I can't
handle that
all right so looks like this is the last
bit of glue and I'm glad because it's
stinky it's kind of freaking me out a
little bit very strong and you should be
able to stand this baby up okay
oh she's showing how she would sew it
now because they're bleep there's the
nose so verse and this is sober so now
they just showed uh the no sew version
now we're gonna show so she's pinning
she's selling so maybe breaking this up
into two videos oh yeah there's one for
so and one for no so it would be really
helpful I know we take them more time
but I think that would be more how sighs
I'd have glued in here just a little bit
in the corners because I felt like they
were kind of coming open and now we need
to figure out how we're gonna turn this
right side out and keep the glue and
stick fabric to I think the sides are
okay the bottom might break through but
you can always fix that once it's turned
out me just rolling it bending it and
rolling it you know what else is good in
the video they use the same fabric so
mm-hmm you can see exactly what what's
gonna yeah do you like that yeah that is
good because if they use a different
fabric I may have been a little more
confused about how to place the pattern
yeah I mean not the pattern but how to
place the pieces all right so this came
out actually really cute I'm very
surprised at how pretty that looks I
didn't expect it to look that pretty new
we like that a lot so the next part of
the video I really liked because she
talked through it and she really told
you what to do and I feel like I wish
that was through the whole video so what
she did was she folded this I guess on
this way I don't know it's easier for me
to do it up then down to me I don't know
why but it's like to fold it this way
right and then kind of pinch it ditch
and she ironed it right and then she
folded it again but I didn't see any
kind of gluing or anything she just
ironed it down did you see glue did we
watch the end that was that it that was
it
see but if I was by myself I don't know
if I would be good at holding this down
in place and having I now that we've
ironed this do you think this is gonna
hold live for the long term if this is
just priests without any glue you think
we need to glue it okay oh yeah office
tonight
okay so let's do this whole button thing
I'm measuring out my loop to be about
three inches long for the button that
I'm using if it's perfectly I'm going to
cut a little hole to put some Baker's
twine through after I looped it through
the button loop to be able to attach it
since it's a no sew version I can't sew
it on by hand stitching it using the
Baker's twine kind of fixes it in place
so the button the directions for the
button were very I couldn't see what
they were doing at all could maybe see
Sandra what they were doing when a
button so we're a little confused so
this is the button that they sent it's
super cute so one thing they were
thinking about doing was just cutting
off what we think cutting a hole and
then sticking it through the hole like
with this backing on it yeah that was
one on but then we were saying that when
we wash it this isn't going to you know
make it so I think we're just gonna
stitch it really quickly and I'm not a
stitcher will you show me how to stitch
it we gave the full packet of needles
yeah I think they said that there's the
some of the materials they sent we're
kind of extra for like a first box Oh
gotcha and then you have them for future
projects
oh yeah he's gonna come down the buttons
gonna read fasten here and the loop is
gonna come down okay yeah I can
visualize that
yeah like measurements for where the
button goes would be really helpful so
I'm gonna double up this thread okay I
don't have to do so many stitches it's a
good idea
so you just not at that and would you
wait the purpose of that to knot it so
it doesn't come through the front
oh okay some people don't do that they
leave it unknotted and leave enough
thread so that you can tie a knot and
get done with it but I think it's gonna
be easier just so you'll just pull it
through from the inside that makes sense
I don't know let's ditch it or anyone
let's just clip it blew it how do we
glue it no well we want it to go like
this so I don't know because because I
feel like it's not gonna stay I mean
maybe we could tuck it under here and
glue it like quit I don't need yeah I
goes underneath one of these so is they
gonna lift this okay see them up and
simply cut a little piece off yeah make
sure it's long enough to get like this
and not too long because you want to cut
a bigger piece just in case
but bambam we have a lunch bag stand it
up ya Yin's you ready for final thoughts
okay that's okay
okay okay all right okay so we made it
back we made it back and I can honestly
say that there's no way I would have
been able to make this without you so
it's fun thank you for coming over and
helping me with this
so now being a non crafter I found this
to be very difficult but I mean I guess
everyone has their different abilities
for following directions but as a
crafter what was your opinion if you had
gotten this box as a crafter what do you
think do you think it was easy or
difficult or the first thing I'd be
looking for is the instructions yeah she
sent those to you I don't know if that's
part of the correspondence that comes
with this box but I would want the
instructions and I don't want everything
I want to lay everything out and then
see what I have and then go from there
yeah definitely definitely I feel like
maybe like a list of a list of items
actually I'm gonna get something real
quick okay so like for example this is
hello fresh this is the cooking
subscription that I do and this is kind
of the way that they have it laid out
they have the picture of the final
product here they have the kind of a
description of what it's going to be and
then they have pictures of everything
that you're going to need in order to
make the recipe and then on the other
side they have again how much you're
gonna need for each recipe this may not
be necessary for the crafting box but
they have the step 1 step 2 step 3 step
4 to 5 and then they have accompanying
pictures to go along with each step so
these are the kind of instructions that
I personally can follow so I wish this
box had something like that with the
photos along with the video I think the
video is really cute but I think that
along with that we need something
written right and I what we also need in
the beginning is to know how long this
craft is going to take mm-hmm I mean if
you if you don't know you might not be
able to plan that time for the day so
right now something saying this will
take you 30 minutes 20 minutes and then
maybe you'll know if it's going to long
that maybe you need to get more
instruction exactly and I think in that
the video they said it took them about
30 minutes but do you think it took us
about two hours overall probably about
an hour 45 minutes for this craft
between figuring things out how long it
took us to kind of decipher what we were
supposed to do rewatching the video over
and over again and I feel like it
shouldn't have been that difficult I
think that if the video we've been a
little slower maybe we would have been
able to follow directions faster and it
would have been a faster craft I agree
definitely yeah also you know I I think
that it's a really cute little bag it's
really really cute and I definitely
think that I'm going to be using us I
think that's a positive we also talked
about we really like that they use the
same fabric yes and that the fabric had
lines definitely the lines helped a
great deal that was and then when it
matched up we tried moving the fabric
back and forth to see if the pattern
won't be affected and it wasn't so
that's really a good thing with this
pattern right but it didn't have to be
right side up or upside down right
that's helpful too
the other thing that we were talking
about was the glue itself when we read
the glue we kind of had a little
freakout moment that we edited out where
we read that the glue really you need to
be in a very well ventilated area they
actually recommend you do it outside and
then leave the craft outside for 12
hours so there's a little bit of a
concern for us about inhaling the glue
and then I couldn't get my window open
and then what are we talking about with
being a lunch bag in that glow getting
on the food and have a banana
something with a natural wrapper or a
banana and apple it will it seep into
your food and also our hands you might
want to do use that glue with some
gloves right yeah and having that
direction would be really helpful too
especially if you're buying this for a
teenager you know you want to have
information about the glue in there you
know because you don't want your
teenager actually gluing our fingers
together because the second this glue
can actually glue metal to metal so you
know knowing that in there with also I
think would be really helpful but
overall I mean we talked about that that
I've never seen a subscription like this
of you know it's very unique I
really haven't not like this not with a
craft and supplies no yeah and they
really give you plenty of supplies
everything you need and more to make the
craft so I think that it's a great start
I think they're off to a good start and
I think that they've got a great idea I
think it's just gonna be ironing out the
details thank you so much for watching
