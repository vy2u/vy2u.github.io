smackdown today we are going to be
talking about whether it's worth it to
spend extra money on your pedicure
system or whether something like this
that's very low-tech is good enough
this video is going to have multiple
parts I'm going to give myself a very
glorious pedicure and we're gonna use
the Clarisonic on the left side and
we're going to use the scooter on the
other but before we do that you're gonna
have to know what the world these things
are so let's start with the Clarisonic
now this is a product that I got from
Nordstrom Rack awhile ago and I just
never broke it out this was marked down
to 49 97 from a 200 dollar price tag
$199 it says MSRP $1.99 it says it's a
335 dollar value it is made by
Clarisonic and it is called the petty
sonic foot transformation and it comes
with lots of stuff inside not just this
I did look for this online to make sure
that it was still available you can buy
this I believe I saw it at Walmart calm
and then it's Sears calm for a hundred
and thirty ish dollars I'll put all of
the information down below in case you
do want to purchase this let me show you
what you get so you get the petty which
is this and then you also get three
complimentary Essie nail polishes which
is pretty fabulous if you like these
colors these will run you about eight to
nine dollars a piece in the drugstore
they sent not sent but in this kit you
get dressed to kill you also get take it
outside and then you get she said yes
let me just get the names right so this
is called the wet look this is called
the wet dry buffing brush head and this
is called the smoothing disc here there
are some settings so this is the on/off
button here oh my goodness okay this is
the speed up button and the speed down
button there's also a battery life
indicator down here and it also comes
with something called the plink charger
which this has been sitting on to charge
it along with that you get a bunch of
other products and
so it's not just the petty that you get
you also get all of these products so it
comes with the petit bomb sonic sonic
foot softening treatment and then you
also get a big thing of the petty buff
sonic smooth foot smoothing treatment is
that the same thing what the world
teddy buff oh this is the pedi balm and
this is the petty buff morrow so this is
a during treatment and then this is an
after treatment
so we playing with those you also get
the serum here and this is the petty
boost sonic foot renewing peel so that
is what you get I mean you get a ton of
stuff in this port your $199 or your
$135 or your $50 if you got lucky like
me and founded it Nordstrom Rack
hopefully lucky hopefully it works so
comes with a lot now with the scooter
this is the scooter I don't have the
packaging anymore I don't know what the
world I did with it but it is just this
here you get this and then this opens up
and it's got this little shield here and
it comes with two extra ones of these
this is $10 and you can get it at Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I think they also sell it
at Amazon and that's it there's no
battery there's no charging it's just
very simple to the point you rub it on
your feet that's it so we're gonna see
whether this can keep up with this so
first thing we need to do if we're gonna
do a real pedicure is we need to soak
the feet so I am going to take my bowl
I'm gonna fill it with some warm water
and some essential oils and I'm going to
soak my feet for five minutes
dry them completely and I'll be right
back okay I've soaked my feet I edited
that part out because you don't need to
see me sitting there with my feet in a
bowl it's just not interesting let's get
to the good stuff I've waited for my
feet to completely dry both of these
products recommend that your feet be dry
when you do this part in the directions
for the Clarisonic it says that for
twice-weekly you're supposed to use the
smoothing discs on dry feet and on the
dry rough patches one minute per area
and then follow with the wet dry buffing
a brush
that's what we're gonna do today and
then there are some ways to use the
other products that come with it so
we're gonna go ahead and start with the
petit by Clarisonic and I am going to
put a close-up on my feet don't be
creepy now all you creepy people if
you're creepy you don't have to watch
this video only people that really truly
care about pedicures are allowed to
watch this just that's what I'm saying
so I'm hoping people listen to me
because I'm a little nervous to do this
to sound want creepy people come to my
video you know there's not much I can do
about it and let's zoom in on my feet so
my feet probably aren't the ugliest feet
there ever were but they're ugly enough
I've let them get really yucky usually
by now I've I've definitely taken care
of the drawing this so you can kind of
see I've got some dryness here some in
here a little bit up here this feels
very very rough up here this feels rough
back here and over here on the side is
kind of yucky and then the other side
looks the same so let's go ahead and get
storied with the clear so look oh I know
I'm a little bit nervous I don't know
why okay so we're just supposed to turn
it on I can tell you I already turn this
off I already don't like the noise I
also don't like the way it feels in my
hand I don't like the way it vibrates it
just kind of it's very hard a vibration
and they kind of I can see that not
being fun to hold after a while that's
that's my initial impression I haven't
used this before so let's just go for it
so one minute per section so
okay I'm moving it around a little bit
because it's starting to get a little
sensitive here and I don't like the way
that it feels so I'm kind of moving it
yeah I don't think my feet can take a
full minute in this area it just doesn't
feel good it feels like it's gonna cut
my skin like I just don't like the way
it feels maybe I just don't have a rough
enough area
one thing I don't like about these
directions is it doesn't say it says per
area does that mean like this big of an
area or does that mean my whole heel
what does area mean how I wish they'd
used a more descriptive words an area
come I'm gonna take area to mean the
entire Ile so I'm just gonna keep going
okay so it just pulsed so that means
that it has been a minute so I'm gonna
keep doing more over on this side and I
got a witness
you'll never suspect okay so it just
post so I'm gonna assume that this heel
is done I'm gonna go ahead and do my big
toe up here oh I see a lot of yup coming
off there now just as a little backstory
I do have don't have a lot of feeling in
my big toes I did point ballet when I
was in late middle school and ever since
then I haven't had a lot of feeling in
my big toe so yeah you know dangers of
the job of being a ballerina a long time
ago so I can't really feel if I'm gonna
hurt if I hurry myself here so that kind
of makes me nervous
okay I just turned off so I'm assuming
that that means that it's been another
minute
kind of turned off by itself I don't
think that I hit the button the suspense
a quarter-sized amount of the petty buff
to the soles of the feet and then use a
moistened wet dried buffing brush head
to massaged into the skin for two
minutes on each foot word of course
we're just doing the one foot
concentrating on the heels and other
rough dry areas okay so I'm going to
switch this out see how do I switch it
out there we go well that was easy
enough and I don't see anything having
like I've pulled it off I didn't I don't
see anything inside so it doesn't look
like anything is collecting inside which
is kind of good because then you don't
have to worry about cleaning these areas
inside so I'm gonna take that off we'll
put this on here okay so let's take our
petty buff and it says a quarter sized
amount it's about a dime yes if you
flatten that out that's about a quarter
it smells a very minty and you can see
there's like little granules in here
okay so it says I need to moisten this
so I'm gonna take the brush shut off and
I'm a voice in it real quick all right I
have moistened the brush head and now
I'm gonna put this on the bottom of my
feet focusing on the parts that I just
treated I wish I'd brought a towel in
here because this does not feel good on
my hand all right so we're gonna put it
on they said to do the highest setting
so I'm gonna push the up arrow doesn't
feel like it's changing at all alright
that feels kind of nice I like that I
like that better than the other way
the other treatment
okay there's one minute let's go over to
the two
all right so that's two minutes my hand
feels gross I wish I brought a towel in
here now it doesn't say to rinse my foot
before I put on the next step daily
apply a liberal amount to dry feet
following the petted buff or peti boost
treatment so for the Pettibone so you
know I'm gonna do I'm gonna use my good
judgment and I'm gonna go rinse my foot
off and I'll be right back all right so
I've rinsed my foot off it's not
completely dry yet but it looks really
good I don't see any dry patches anymore
it feels good feel softer it feels nice
I think it's in a really good job
awesome very cool says immediately
following the use of the wet dry buffing
brush head dispense a nickel sized
amount of the pedi boost each foot
gently smoothing over soles of feet wait
three to five minutes and then apply the
pedable I did that right right had a
goose putt a ball pad a buff what to the
pet of boots that's this one immediately
I'm a little slow for immediately so I
admit it nickel sized amount okay so
it's this little dropper nickel size
it's about a nickel and then put that
all over oh that feels good feels a
little slimy it feels kind of nice
smells like like rotten egg nog it
smells pretty bad like a chemically egg
nog kind of sense
I don't enjoy that sin at all it's
pretty terrible it's not super strong
but I can definitely smell it it doesn't
smell good wait three to five minutes
and then apply the peda balm so that's
what we'll do we'll be back in four
minutes all right so the pedo pedo what
the pet a boost is on the foot it's been
four minutes it said three to five so I
did four now I'm gonna put on the pet a
bone it's a lot of steps this is really
for people that like that pampering
business I'd like to really take their
time with their pedicures all right so
there we go
so the next step would be to do my
cuticles paint my toes and again we're
gonna do that all off camera because
that's not very exciting we want to see
whether we did spend money on this
Clarisonic or this scooter can do do the
job just as well so now it's time to
test the scooter so here we go and all
I'm gonna do here is I'm just going to
take this and I'm going to rub it on my
dry foot until it looks good so here we
go
they only have to put a little more
muscle into this one but it's not too
bad
actually I don't even know if I need a
minute it's like it's almost done you
can see all the yuck that it's
collecting
that feels good okay so let's do the tow
whoo got skin falling everywhere that's
kind of gross and have to vacuum in here
when I'm done sorry if you're grossed
out by this I'm kind of grossed out by
myself right now but it just shows that
it's working you know so instead of
doing all the stuff that came with the
clear sonic I'm just gonna put some
lotion on my tush and see if it ends up
looking the same in honor of the
holidays I have this bliss snowflake
high-intensity hand cream and I'm just
gonna stick it on my foot
so I can definitely tell you the process
is a lot faster with the scooter we feel
this side and up but honestly they feel
to the touch they feel the same they
don't feel any different
they both feel smooth try to put them
neck I can't even get my feet up here
Lila come here sit down right there okay
now take my feet I'll hold that foot up
and hold this foot up
okay so you got it okay so thank you
child for being my foot stand so you can
look and see what you think did they
look the same no no I think they're kind
of looked the same how do they look
while my feet look the same it was
different hmm same all right thank you
okay so I feel like these two products
have different markets okay so I think
that the Clarisonic is for people that
really want to take their time with
their feet you know you just want to
just you know sit with your feet for a
good half an hour you know soaking your
feet and then doing both steps and then
doing the different treatments and
everything I mean you're looking at more
of a process kind of like you would get
in a spa where you would do multiple
treatments where I feel like the scooter
is for people that don't got time for
all of that you know because the results
come out at least from this first
treatment from one treatment pretty much
exactly the same if not exactly the same
so you're looking at $135 for that spa
like experience with all the extra
products or ten dollars for that let me
just get my feet looking good really
really quick kind of thing with the
scooter so it really is up to you which
one you like better personally I don't
think I have the patience for the
Clarisonic I think this is a little too
much for me I've got two kids I've got a
husband I gotta make dinner now and I
feel like I'm behind on my dinner
because it took so long to use this
thing but if you've got the time and you
like pampering yourself definitely go
ahead with the Clarisonic but for me
personally I think I'm gonna stick with
the scooter and I'm going to see passed
this on to somebody
see I don't know but it's a personal
care product so I don't know
if anybody would want to use this after
I use it maybe my mother but I don't
know if anybody else would want to use
it the other thing that you want to keep
in mind is that this does come with two
replacements little pads or whatever you
call them here the little Grady looking
thing there's two replacements that come
with it the Clarisonic does not come
with replacements there is a
recommendation here it says that for
optimal results replace your wet/dry
buffing brush head this one every three
months and then the smoothing disc every
six months so this is going to be more
expensive to maintain as well because
you're gonna have to replace this brush
at every three months I will put
information about how much all of that
costs down in the description below cuz
I don't know off the top of my head how
much the replacement brush heads cost
the other thing too is if for some
reason they stopped manufacturing this
you're not probably not gonna be able to
find the brush heads anymore which is
kind of a not so good thing if for
whatever reason they stopped
manufacturing the scooter you know
you're out ten bucks versus out 135 or
whatever wherever you can get the price
for this I'm saying 135 because that's
what I found it for currently even
though the retail price is $1.99 so for
me I'm voting for the scooter for you it
may be something different depending on
your personal needs so I want to thank
you so much for watching this video if
