review of the dose of colors liquid
lipsticks we will give you a thorough
review in five minutes or less I got the
brand new currant saved bundle of liquid
lipsticks they are $75 for the bundle
you get five of them but its $90 for
full price if you bought them all
individually in the bundle I got
chocolate wasted brick Los Angeles which
is spelled very interestingly truffle
and supernatural they do say on the
website that you should exfoliate your
lips before use and also avoiding oily
or greasy foods which we're going to be
talking about the brand of colored is
vegan cruelty free gluten free paraben
free and they are made in the United
States they are an indie brand
there are a few ingredients in here that
you might want to know about the first
one is cyclopentyl siloxane it's a three
on Environmental Working Group its job
is to be skin conditioning it is
silicone bait Environmental Working
Group says it is persistent or bio
cumulative and wildlife that you may
want to wipe off this lipstick rather
than washing it down the sink
one interesting ingredient this is
denatured alcohol it is something that
can really dry your skin I looked up a
lot of liquid lipsticks all over from
Sephora and Ulta and Andy brand and I
could not find a single other formula
that specifically said they use
denatured alcohol I'm assuming this is
because it is such a drying ingredient
so I don't know why they chose to use
this instead of a different type of
alcohol to knock the ethanol as a
preservative there are some irritation
concerns for that there are also a
couple of colorants that are not isafe
so please do not use these as eyeliner
let me preface my full review by saying
I've never found a perfect liquid
lipstick that goes on opaque is it drive
is completely transfer proof I've never
found one I've heard that they exist my
acquaintances Stephanie Nicole said that
the makeup monsterous ones are the best
ones but I have never tried those these
are no different these are not perfect
I'll tell you the great things and then
the shortcomings so the good things
about these is they are very transfer
resistant it takes a lot for them to
come all of your lips oil is the enemy
of these liquid lipsticks if you want to
take them off really quickly and really
easily just have some oil on them so of
course while you're wearing them you
don't want to eat any oily foods another
positive about these is that they're
very comfortable they don't feel
excessively drying and they don't flake
off of the lips a negative is that they
can tend to stay a little bit sticky if
you notice my lips still kind of stick
together a little bit even after hours
of wearing them I will say though that
they wear down relatively nicely a lot
of liquid lipsticks I'll put a lip balm
over it to help it to last a little bit
longer I find that that kind of makes
this particular formula kind of mush
around the left so I do not use a lip
balm with these in order to make them
last longer the best way to we get
continued use out of them is just to
simply reapply speaking of applying you
want to make sure
use a lip liner with these because they
can bleed outside the lip line a little
bit upon application and the darker
colors are a little Messier to use but
overall I really really love using these
liquid lipsticks I feel like they are
comfortable enough that I can wear them
without really thinking about that I
have liquid lipstick on my lips which is
a big deal for me I'm big on comfort
with my liquid lipstick and these
definitely do well with that leaves out
a little bit of a sweet scent but it's
not a very strong scent so if you're
sensitive to scents you may not be
bothered by these which is another
positive so overall thumbs up on the
dose of colors liquid lipsticks for me
personally but you definitely have to
listen to the full review to make sure
that they are good for you because what
I like isn't necessarily what you like
so take into consideration all of the
points of it to decide whether these
would be good for you or not I want to
thank you so much for watching this
