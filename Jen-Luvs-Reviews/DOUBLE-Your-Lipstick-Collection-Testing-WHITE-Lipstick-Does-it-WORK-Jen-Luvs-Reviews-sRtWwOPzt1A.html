what I think I might go get a white
lipstick yeah I haven't either but I
bought this anyway because the marketing
on this says that it's supposed to
transform any shade into a lighter shade
of lipstick so I figured we could just
try it out together this is one of Kat
Von D's new studded kiss lipsticks and
the marketing on this like I mentioned
is that it is white and it is supposed
to transform any lipstick into a lighter
shade I did do a little bit of research
you can buy white lipstick from other
brands white lipstick is not anything
new just from a very quick google search
I found that Mac has one and NYX has one
so if you're you like the way that this
looks don't feel like you got to go buy
the Kat Von D you might want to go ahead
and check out the next one I can't vouch
for it I've never tried it but it does
exist and you might be able to get the
exact same thing from that so what I did
was I brought out some of my deeper
lipsticks from like makeup forever I
have one from dose of colors I've one
from Oprah and then I have a color pop
and I figured we would just try these on
so you can see how it works to decide
whether a white lipstick might be right
for you
I'm gonna go ahead and remove my lip
product oh this is way late why did I
use this I just remember I found this in
a drawer and I remembered why I don't
use this it is so oily this is the the
Almain or hydrating me
oh it's eye makeup remover pads oops mmm
stupid alright now that my idiot self
got that off let's go ahead and I'm just
gonna put this on by itself so you can
see what it looks like on its own
oh wow
well that's very interesting so as I put
it on by itself I can feel that it
almost feels a little bit drying on the
lips which is kind of weird like on the
edges of my lips it feels a little bit
dry I'm gonna go ahead and remove this
and then we're gonna start the testing
okay that did come off relatively easily
which is a good thing I use this in live
chat the other day and one of the
glourious members of the collective
brain I'm so smart she suggested that I
put it on underneath the lipstick
because that way I won't get the color
from the lipstick on to the tube so I'm
just gonna put this on half of my lips
now let's play it safe and we're gonna
start with the makeup forever artist
Rouge matte in M 450 so you can see
there is definitely a difference between
the two sides the one with the white the
one without just for fun let's go ahead
and apply this over top Wow how fun is
that I find it to be very fun but then
we have the problem of that this now has
lipstick all over it but it definitely
works I'll tell you that now we're gonna
use actual lipstick remover get this off
of my lips now and let's try a different
color try to liquid lipstick this time
okay let's do just clean this off and
well mostly often we clean all the way
off I'm losing product every time I
clean it though so you know keep that in
mind let's do the dose of colors liquid
lipstick
all right this is in the shade Los
Angeles but jealous is spelled like
jealous instead of Angeles and I never
wear the shape because it's scary so
let's see if Kat Von D can make it a
little less scary I don't seem to be
getting any white transfer onto the
applicator so that's a good thing I'm
gonna go ahead and let this dry a little
bit because this formula does dry down
pretty well and then we're gonna put the
white over top all right let's put the
cap on the over top because there really
isn't a huge difference doing it that
way but I bet you this is gonna make a
big difference
that's really pretty I like it it's very
fun okay I have an idea let's go ahead
and try out an ombre lip with this
let's do grunge now this one I feel like
is a shade that it's so dark that
there's only certain like I only I can
only wear it when I'm like in a certain
mood all right Kat pull through for me
oh my gosh I love that look how pretty
that is and what I really like about it
is it's pulling the center of my lip
forward so it's actually making my lips
look bigger in my opinion and it looks
really pretty I really like that a lot I
want to keep this on but I've got one
more that I wanted to show you let's try
to hombre a liquid lipstick this is the
Ofra Santa Ana I'm gonna put this on
first and see what happens
am I ready for Instagram lip art yes No
okay I don't think that worked very well
let's go ahead and put it on top
definitely looks very 80s with this ah
but it is cute I don't think I can leave
this one on and take myself seriously so
I'm going to switch back to grunge so
now I've got an eye lip that I believe
matches my eyes so I can talk to you so
final thoughts on this does it work
yes is it fun yes is it necessary no
especially at this price point when you
can get a white lipstick that should be
pretty similar from NYX for like seven
bucks the one thing I really don't like
about having to do this is the whole
wiping off the tip thing to get the lip
color off I feel like that is a big like
MA for this because I'm losing a lot of
product and wiping it off before this I
think I'd used it maybe three times you
can see it's already starting to wear
down a bit just from this swatch video
so I would imagine this would last you
know not you know half as long as a
regular lipstick tube so even more
reason to buy the less expensive
expensive version and just from
experience with NYX lipsticks it should
be pretty opaque just like this I do
enjoy that formula so I have a feeling
that one's going to be just as good as
this but it is really fun I'm not gonna
return it I'm really enjoying it I'm
thankful I have it but again price point
I don't think as a hundred percent
necessary when there's alternatives out
there for you if you know of any other
white lipsticks that different brands
make definitely leave those in the
comments below because we are the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
and we work together to make sure we
don't buy crap and make sure we help
each other to buy things that are
totally worth it so if you know another
white lipstick definitely let us know if
you've had experience with it but yeah I
think the whole concept is cool and I
definitely recommend trying some version
