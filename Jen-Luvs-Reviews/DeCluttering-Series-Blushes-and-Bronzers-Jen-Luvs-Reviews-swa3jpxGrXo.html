my decluttering series this is going to
be a really difficult one for me this is
my blush store these are my babies
like I love my blush I don't know why I
mean seriously like how many shades of
pink do I seriously need I mean really
truly it's kind of dumb so let's go
ahead and jump in and declutter this
business alright so this is just my
blush and bronzer collection like this
is of course someone's got to start
hacking down bushes right at the
beginning of my decluttering seriously
really really perfect timing perfect
timing so I'm starting I'm starting to
run out of time for this video so I've
got to keep going even though my
neighbor is apparently getting a tree
chopped up next door
so we're just gonna go ahead and jump me
look I had time to paint my nails
alright let's go ahead and just go into
this so alright here we go so first
thing here on the top is Bobby Brown's
are setting noise I swear I'm sorry
alright
apricot by Bobby Brown alright this
thing I never ever use ever and I think
I'm going to keep it because I spent a
stupid amount of money on this thing and
I need to just move it to my highlight
drawer and set up my blush door and then
I think I'm gonna use it more so we're
gonna go ahead and keep that this I just
got from Jacob Beauty these this is
their blush in a baby boo and I really
love this blush it's a little dark for
me but I think it's gonna be really nice
especially in the winter time so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep that I think
that that's gonna be great for that like
just came in from the cold kind of look
alright this laura mercier highlight was
my very first high-end highlight john
bought this for me I love this highlight
i this is in the wrong drawer as well so
I don't use it as much as I should this
is just called an illuminator
I don't know illuminator yes I'm gonna
keep that
all right this two-faced son bunny
bronzer this is also kind of old it
looks like it's getting some hardpan I
don't feel like this product is good
anymore I'm actually gonna throw that
away which makes me sad that this has
gone to waste because this is a really
nice bronzer
all right this here is a little tiny
baby NARS Laguna and I do really like
Laguna I'm gonna have to see if I have
anymore Laguna's in here but I think I
am going to keep this I really I like
this bronzer it's a nice bronzer I think
I do though I think Lagoon is in here
let me say yep Laguna's in here so you
know what I don't know we'll see look I
even saw the plastic on that alright umm
hmm maybe I'll pass this along to
somebody since I have a giant Lagoon on
I don't travel enough to need of two of
them so I'm gonna go ahead and pass this
along to someone all right speaking of
NARS will go into this I really love
this the only thing I don't love in this
is the highlighter this was the virtual
domination palette I think it came out
last holiday season I love I love these
these three here really these two I
could kind of do without if I had these
two as separate I would get rid of them
but I love these three so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that goodness I'm not
doing very well so far
alright this is a project one runway
limited edition L'Oreal blush this is a
beautiful shade I just never give it
love I actually got this in a really old
boxycharm and before boxycharm I had
high-end products this was when they
were drugstore primarily so I don't
reach for this set up I'm gonna pass
this along because it is a really nice
blush and I just don't use it enough
this Bare Minerals let's see this is a
bareMinerals blush that I never use I
have a million shades like this I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that along this
is a Tarte in splendour and I very
rarely use this it has lots and lots and
lots of glitter in it I'm gonna go ahead
and pass that although okay let me see
so this is where I'm getting torn
because I love these brushes I love
these things do might need them though I
don't know if I need them I don't know
alright let's start what let's hold off
on these let's hold off on these I'm
starting to like freak out a little bit
alright
or Geller this one's definitely gonna be
a Keith this is an ethereal rose and
Satine subtle berry and I absolutely
love this oh my gosh if you get a chance
to try and evil or Geller's baked
products they're amazing
all right this is something I'm not
going to keep this as the model code
cheek and lip stain I very rarely use
this I'm gonna pass that along this one
as well this one I got in a meanie box
and this thing is just orange it's just
not in my shade I'm passing it along
okay these NYX stick blushes are kind of
old they're starting to develop kind of
a film on them I'm actually gonna throw
these away I don't feel like they're
good enough to pass along to anyone
maybe what I'll do is I'll try to chop
the top off and see if there's enough
usable product underneath I mean there's
actually quite a bit under there that's
probably still good so maybe I'll just
kind of trim with a knife the top off
and give these away but I never reach
for these I'm gonna pass those along
same thing with this NYX blush this is
very very shiny let me just kind of
swatch that for you it's got a very very
very much a shine to it and I just never
reached for it so I'm gonna pass that
along as well same thing with this
master glaze by by Maybelline a really
nice stick blush I just never use it I
never use it I'm gonna chop the top off
and pass that along this one I got
recently this is the I got a what is it
about a beauty box five I got this in a
beauty box five and it's by stylee style
i swatched it and I used it once and I
did not like it it doesn't have enough
pigmentation for me so I'm gonna pass
that along as well this is a stick
lecture that I'm actually gonna keep
this one is the Tarte blushing bride I
do use this one I love the texture of
this one it's got just enough shine it's
a beautiful blush I'm gonna keep that
one okay this one is a Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer this one is
newer than this one this one's the Sun
bunny but this this chocolate Soleil I'm
gonna keep I really like this one a lot
hey this is another company sent this to
me for review this is from Madison
Street Beauty this is actually a
beautiful blush but I never reach for it
again never reach for it so I'm gonna
pass that along okay okay this year I
know I'm getting rid of this is a master
highlight by face studio by Maybelline
and
never use this either it's like a
bronzer I don't know it really comes off
as a bronzer when you swirl them and I
just don't I don't ever use it it's to
oranjee for me I don't use it I'm
passing that along okay okay
mirabela this is another one that's kind
of old but I really love this it kind of
is a lot like the Laura Geller one as
far as the shine I really don't need
both but this one I think is too old to
pass along and I love this too one too
much to get rid of so I'll keep this one
a little bit longer and use it a bit but
I don't I don't feel comfortable passing
this one along to anyone all right
this NYX blush I love in the wintertime
it's just absolutely beautiful it's a
really fun holiday blush I mean it looks
very red but it's beautiful on the
cheeks for a party for a holiday party
and I love love love this blush so I'm
definitely keeping that this is my only
becca blush and i absolutely adore this
in the wintertime this one is in Sweet
Pea and oh my gosh it's just it's just
that perfect like MALDI like deep deep
color it gives a beautiful glow to the
skin in the winter time just absolutely
gorgeous I love this blush I'm keeping
that along the same lines this NYX blush
this is in cocoa this is another one
that I use a lot in the wintertime it's
definitely got more of a reddish tinge
than the becca one but i love that one
as well for similar purposes the Becca
one I really like that I don't know do I
need them both though do I need both of
these are they similar enough that I can
get rid of one yes they are I'm gonna
get rid of the next one I'm gonna keep
the back of one oh I hate doing that
though because I've used this one so
much and I love it but it's not like to
use that I feel like I can't pass it
along so I'm gonna pull hate that okay
Smashbox this one is an exact dupe for
the elf one that I just got but I can't
bear to get rid of this I love this
thing I'm keeping that some things I
can't there's no logic I just need to
keep it all right this is the NARS blush
this got totally pushed to the back this
is in fervor the duo this is what with
this called dual intensity blush I still
really really like this it just got
pushed to the back of my drawer so I'm
gonna go ahead and make sure that gets
up into
front alright this Eddie Funkhouser
blushed this shade or there goes to the
tree chopped and again
okay this shade is just not for me it's
too bright for me so I'm gonna pass that
along okay Kat Von D blushes are a
no-brainer I'm keeping these these are
my favorite blush formula of all time
but wait a second look at this look at
this oh my gosh that breaks my heart
Kent are they different enough come on
please be different enough because I
need to justify keeping both of these oh
my gosh oh my gosh are you kidding me no
no okay they're different huh yeah
they're different enough this one's
pinkier yay okay I'm justifying it this
is my favorite blush of all time Essex
by Kat Von D it's it's now discontinued
they don't make it anymore and I love
this blush oh my gosh okay alright I'm
keeping the both yay cool okay another
thing I'm keeping cool oh by benefits I
really really like this bronzer this is
not a contouring bronzer this is like a
bronzer bronzer but I really like it a
lot
this is one that I have never used I've
wanted to use it I looked at it many
times but I don't like it because it's
to oranjee something to pass that along
okay this is also this is a Coastal
Scents forever blush I've never used
this so I'm gonna pass that along look I
just jammed up my nail cuz my nail
polish was uh was wet still apparently
all right this is my favorite cream
blush of all time this is the Makeup
Forever HD cream blush I love this thing
this is another one that got buried
because I too much junk in my drawer
even though it looks very light I can
really blend it out and it can turn into
the most beautiful shade this is the
shade just to 2:25 and this is the only
one of these formula that I have and I
want to get more they're just really
expensive so I don't have too many of
them oh my gosh that noise I'm so sorry
okay this is only time I have to do this
alright this is this shouldn't
let's say Chanel and tweed pink Lily
Spurgeon gave this to me as well this is
a really nice blush it seems like I
can't get a big color payoff off of it
I've tried and tried and I just don't
use it even though I love you Lilly and
I thank you for sending this to me I
just don't use it I can't get enough
color payoff from it so I'm gonna go
ahead and try to pass it on to someone
that wants a little bit less color
payoff this one here is called by
Pandora's box this is a blush Ian I
don't know what's the shade of this it
doesn't say I actually got this out of a
little black bag if you remember a
little black bag from back in the day
and I loved it when I got it but I just
haven't used it so I'm gonna go ahead
and pass that along these cargo products
are new I really like these cargo
blushes a lot and encargo is one of
those really underrated makeup brands
that does not get enough love I need to
get a makeup light or something because
this is just craziness but I love the
shade it's got a little bit of shimmer
to it and it builds really nicely so
that you can start off really light and
then build it up I love this this is the
shade where did it go at the top though
this is in Los Cabos so I'm excited to
be able to keep that and move it to the
front so that I use it more before
summer's over because I see this as
being more of a summer product oh my
gosh why do you have to chop trees now
why okay another cargo product this is a
bronzer a medium this is another product
that I just got that I love just
absolutely beautiful shine for a bronzer
I really love that okay
whoo okay Kat Von D another one in
bellisima another one that I absolutely
love this one's not discontinued I'll
show it to you in case you wanted to
purchase it oh my gosh just absolutely
gorgeous I love it okay keeping that
this is a pure minerals bronzer that I
have never used is another one that I've
looked at a million times I think I got
it in a kit and then just never used it
I think I might have swatched it once so
I'm gonna go ahead and pass that along
might as well get this one out of the
way this was the tarte holiday blush set
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this I
really like this blush set I don't reach
for it enough but I think oh my gosh
there's a treatment let me see look can
you see that it's a tree going by my
window look at that oh my gosh too funny
they're about to feed it into the
chopper all right back to blush okay so
I'm keeping this I love this I don't use
it enough because I have too many
blushes so we're gonna go ahead and keep
that and now have more room now this
here this is one that is not a
name-brand this is I actually got from
from the born pretty store and I really
love this blush a lot it's at number six
it's by Zen Yi Zhu Xin weii zhe ly and I
really love this blush and it's from a
brand that you know I've never heard of
maybe in in China or wherever this comes
from I think that's Chinese maybe it's
more popular there but man is that a
gorgeous blush or what and I have
nothing else like this I'm definitely
keeping this
yeah I think it's definitely a Chinese
brand there goes the tree being chopped
up all right this right here is another
product that I never use this is an
everyday mineral cheek product Ian
girl Friday and this is a beautiful
beautiful shade oh my gosh I don't know
I don't use it again because my drawer
is too cluttered
it's just absolutely beautiful and I
don't have any other shades like this
I'm totally keeping it okay let's move
on to this this is very old as well this
is the Stila convertible color in peony
I got this in one of my very very first
Sephora favorites kits and I'm gonna
keep this just a little bit longer and
then I'm gonna get rid of it so I'm
going to move this to the front of my
drawers so that I use it okay this I
don't know how this ended up in my
drawer but this is brand new this is and
I think it's called empowered flower
palette by chart this is brand new I got
misplaced I have not used it enough
definitely keeping that that's actually
I shadowed for the most part this is
another product I don't use much this is
the Tarte cheek stain and dreamer I
think I don't know what happened there
but I'm gonna go ahead and chop the top
off and try to pass this along as
someone that will actually use it
coralista I only have a sample of this
but they really love this shade and
again got buried and stopped using it so
definitely keeping for at least I'll
swatch coralista this is a gorgeous
blush definitely definitely deserves the
height that it gets you see you guys see
that running out arm space here
but yeah just the beautiful shine on
there I need to move that to the front
especially because it's still summer
all right this Eddie Funkhouser bronzer
I don't reach for it's a really nice
bronzer but I just never reached for it
so I'm gonna pass along to somebody that
will will use it one thing I love about
this bronzer is that it's got so many
different tones so if you run your brush
in certain areas you'll get different
looks or you can scroll them all
together it's a really nice bronzer I
don't know why I don't reach for it but
I don't someone who passed along Tarte
blush in tipsy another product that I
should be using more and don't just
beautiful this one I really feel like I
have to kind of dig in to get to the
color but once you do man it is
absolutely gorgeous and I love that it's
got kind of a a pinkish I don't know
weapon when you call that is that pink I
don't know in with that bright orange II
kind of color there's a pinkness to it
that I really like a lot all right this
is a Laura Mercier pink mosaic and this
is another product that I haven't used
enough but it's gorgeous this really
should go in with my highlighters and
I'm gonna keep that I'm still putting
these to the side okay tints and SAS
this if I could recommend any lip tints
I would recommend this one this is the
best lip tint I have ever used this is
called tints and sass and it's by
Elizabeth Mont now I got it in a
subscription box I'm pretty sure you can
get this on the Elizabeth Mont Elizabeth
Mott website but this is a fabulous tint
you go ahead and blend that in for you
needless to say I'm keeping it but it is
absolutely gorgeous and lasts a really
long time it gives just enough color
it's beautiful so I'm keeping that okay
down boy by the balm oh I love this
blush I love this blush okay I have to
keep it I have to keep it oh my gosh I'm
terrible I shouldn't keep it but I'm
gonna keep it okay this model Co bronzer
even though I really like this a lot I
know I'm not going to love it deserves
so I'm gonna pass it on even though I
really like this it's got a gold sparkle
in it that's really pretty
but I know I'm not going to give it the
love it deserves I know I'm
so beautiful okay this is what I do I'm
gonna heat this just for the summer and
then I'm gonna pass it on ah I hate this
I hate this okay I'm gonna keep it I'm
gonna keep it I'm keeping it oh my gosh
this is terrible this is so hard okay oh
my goodness another one of these
intellij is passing along passing along
okay Bare Minerals this blush is really
pretty but I think I have like 15
million shades like this I'm passing it
along I've so many shades like this I'm
passing it so I can get the love it
deserves okay this is another one this
is ferro cosmetics this is in desert
rose i don't feel this is so messy
i don't feel it's like getting all over
my bed okay I don't feel comfortable
passing so long because it's so messy so
I think I'm gonna keep it just because I
don't feel comfortable passing it along
because of the messiness but I would
pass that along and it's tiny it's easy
to store this is another one that I
really like but again I have not lots of
shades like this if you've never tried
Madison Street Beauty they sent me these
so long ago but they really really nice
mineral products and it's um it's a
indie company and they're they're
awesome so if you like mineral products
I definitely recommend Madison Street
Beauty but I'm gonna go ahead and pass
that along because I just don't give it
enough love this NYX blush I'm gonna
keep these no I'm just gonna keep this
one because I don't feel like I had
enough shades that were like this I
don't know these like Pink's I don't
think I saved enough light pinks and I
really like this formula I do feel like
I have a million shades like this so I'm
gonna pass this one along oh my gosh
this is heartbreaking okay now look are
these similar I think these might be too
similar maybe I'll keep one and I'll
pass the other one okay alright let's
swatch I'm gonna starts watching on the
other arm okay there's the be a
bombshell
and there's the NYX Oh
the next isn't even swatching what is
going on there I'm not passing along
anybody that's not even swatching what
is happening here hello blush where are
you okay I'm getting rid of that I don't
know why I remember this working really
well I don't know what's happening why
it's not swatching I'm gonna have to
investigate that look it's getting hard
pan on it all right I think that's gonna
have to go in the trash but I'm going to
keep this one alright speaking of that
this one looks similar in tone oh the
mirror came out nice this was my very
first tart blush this is in doll face
this is a similar tone let's see how
similar
see if it's similar to anything else I
had no
okay all right I was taped all face
except for the mirrors broken I think
I'm just gonna take the mirror out and
throw it away because that's just
dangerous to me I'll drop it on a hard
surface and it'll break and that would
be bad okay this is another one that
bombs in Spain blush this is a similar
shade let's try this one out see that
looks just the same you know what
they're pretty much the same I'm gonna
keep the ball I'm gonna get rid of the
tart I hate that okay this one Lillie
Spurgeon also sent me this one is
gorgeous right there it's just a
beautiful beautiful just very subtle
blush and this is it from the 2013
collection of Giorgio Armani and it's a
beautiful very soft blush I really like
this a lot I'm keeping this this thing's
awesome
also underneath there's some there's
some eyeshadows they're kind of broken
but they're really nice so I'm gonna eat
that

question I'm keeping this
just a beautiful contouring bronzer
really love that keeping that my Yves
pearl blush I love this absolutely love
that I'm not gonna swatch that I'm
running out of room but this one is
perfect you can um you can use all three
shades separately or you can sweep them

ahead and see the damage of what I did
yay look like I did that much damage
that's my keep pile but this is my get
rid of pile I mean I feel like I did
pretty well considering how much of a
blush addict I am
these are my babies like I I feel like I
did really well I know that's still a
lot to keep but remember I review
YouTube videos so you know I need to
keep a certain amount of products so
that I can do comparisons and swatches
and things that's how I'm kind of
justifying as many as I'm keeping but I
feel like I did pretty well getting rid
of all of those and I'm proud of me so I
