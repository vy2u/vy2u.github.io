designed yet okay these are my Stila
countless color pigments I went through
so much trying to get every single one
of these I have them all I think except
for the neutral one and it's like this
is my collection this is where this is
where my addiction comes in because this
is my collection of these do I use these
no I don't use them but they're so
pretty I mean look at that look how
gorgeous this is so this is what I'm
gonna do with these this I'm justifying
keeping these because they're all bright
colors for the most part except for like
these two aren't as bright but I'm gonna
say that this is going to be my single
eye shadow brightness and then anything
else that's bright for the most part I'm
gonna get rid of and I'm justifying
keeping these I mean like these things
are so pretty and depending on where you
swatch them you'll get different colors
so if I swatch near the top I'll get a
lighter color this one probably isn't
the best one to do it with but like you
can see all the different shades like
this one is really fun to play with in
the fall I mean just beautiful just
absolutely beautiful I really love this
I'm not really in these swatches are not
doing it justice at all the
beautifulness of this but these were 22
dollars apiece and then they started
going out and then they ended up being
like five bucks apiece the original two
that I got I paid the twenty two dollars
for because I love them so much and then
address room I got on discount like
Nordstrom Rack and stuff so I am gonna
keep those because I love them okay this
is another thing I know that I'm
definitely gonna keep I love these urban
decay eyeshadow do is I use this all the
time this one is in sin and mushroom
amazingness
okay here I have to swatch sin and
mushroom for you because they are just
so fab so fab their sin and there's
mushroom I mean just absolutely
beautiful totally flippin ANCA I got
this in a subscription box I'm never
gonna use that passing it along
it looks pretty it's like a mossy green
I'm gonna pass that along this one I use
a lot this is Napoleon parody I think I
got this from Lilly most of the stuff I
got from Napoleon parody I got from lil
that is stinking gorgeous I'm definitely
keeping that this is one that I got I
got this at Whole Foods this is the
mineral fusion brand it's an organic
brand and I love the shade now that this
is gonna be cleaned out hopefully it
will get more love it really needs to
get more love because it's so soft and
so blendable these are quite expensive
if I remember right I think I paid like
maybe fifteen or twenty dollars for this
but it's just it's so so buttery and so
easy to blend and I really love this
shatter let's go to this one the
Maybelline eye studio quad and
irresistible ivy I never use this I'm
gonna pass it along color tattoos these
are probably dried out I mean that's
just chunky that's going into trash this
one is in toughest taupe I mean that's
just not useful anymore we're gonna get
rid of okay this is my Anastasia brow
powder which I lost which I'm putting
back and where it's supposed to be so
that I can actually use it really like
that I mean it got buried in all this
madness this I got on a trade on Eid zip
this is an urban decay eyeshadow and
narcotic I've never used this after I
traded for it I'm going to get rid of it
another Maybelline Color tattoo this one
is it dried out it doesn't look like it
yes well mmm
I'm never gonna use that I'm never gonna
use it oh I'll see if anybody wants and
if not I'll throw it out actually you
know what this is kind of old I am gonna
throw it out this one is in blue
paradise I think this was a limited
edition one but I'm gonna get rid of it
okay this is another color tattoo this
one is an ancient tank see how dry it
out that baby is I'm gonna keep this one
this one looks like it still has life in
it and I like the color so I'm gonna
keep that one and then this one here so
dirty from being at the bottom here this
one is in cool crush and this one I used
a little bit my first gotta and then I
stopped using it I'm never gonna use
that again I'm gonna see if anybody
wants that one and then thought well I
feel like with these cream products I
can't really pass them on I feel like
they're gonna collect bacteria and I
just don't feel comfortable passing that
on so I'm gonna get rid of that
I'm never gonna use it oh maybe I do
want to keep it it's really pretty
okay I'm keeping it oh I can't stop I
can't stop okay all right this here is
the Josie Maran coconut water look how
its separated let me shake it up
I like this when I first got it and then
I stopped using it and now it's all
separated but this is actually a really
nice product let me swatch this over
here if I if it even then didn't even
shake it up properly but it's really
beautiful blends out really nicely I'm
gonna go ahead and keep just wipe my
swatches off so I could start again
those color tattoos are not coming off
okay well let's keep going because we're
getting there okay next cream shadows

part of the laura mercier purchase that
my husband made when i first started
getting into high-end makeup he got
these for me these are kind of old I
don't know man I don't know okay I think
these are one of those things where I
don't know how much I'm going to use
