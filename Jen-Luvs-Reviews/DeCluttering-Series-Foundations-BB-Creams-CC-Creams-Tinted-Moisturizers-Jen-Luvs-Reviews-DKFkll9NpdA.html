part of my declaring series and this is
my foundation drawer now I feel like
with foundation there are a lot of
things that you know I just don't feel
okay giving away foundation I just feel
like it's kind of a personal thing you
know and I just don't I don't know I
don't know if anybody would want used
foundation I may pass some of it on to a
family member or a close friend but I
don't feel I don't know I feel kind of
weird giving away foundation I don't
know I just don't feel like it's super
sanitary so I'm gonna keep keep or throw
away most of the things if I'm not using
it I'll try to find a close friend to
give away some of it too but I won't be
giving this away to viewers just because
I just think that's kind of I don't know
I don't know it's kind of weird but
anyway so this is my foundation drawer
and obviously I have way too much
foundation to use within a reasonable
amount of time so let's go ahead and
declutter it yay all right so this is
just foundations okay so we're gonna go
ahead and get rid of some of this some
of it is old if I can I'll try to pass
along some of it to somebody but I have
a feeling there isn't gonna be much that
I can pass along just because of
sanitary reasons so let's go ahead and
go through this first is the Revlon BB
cream I did not enjoy this product and
it's getting old so that's gonna go in
the trash the covergirl smoothers a BB
cream I believe I have two of these I
think one of them is Shawn's let me say
I got two of them no it looks like I
just had the one so I think that this
belongs to my husband so I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that for him this is the
boots number seven liftand luminate
foundation this is way too dark for me I
want to try to start doing some cream
contouring kind of situation with this
so I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
makeup for ever matte velvet I love this
foundation it's fab I'm going to keep
that this I believe is also John so I
got to keep that for him this is a coats
face sunscreen I'm sure that I will
use that so we'll keep that
Beautyblender cleanse her we're gonna
keep that these things are I've tried
these these are the upper vision and
tellus shades I've tried this so many
times I've gotten in subscription boxes
and I've already used that so I'm gonna
go ahead and try to pass that along to
somebody because I've tried that product
hi Sam my dog's popping up hopefully he
doesn't make too much of a disturbance
this is the Elizabeth Grant collagen
tinted moisturizer this had excellent
reviews online I have not really seen
anything fabulous to this I think I'm
gonna pass this along my mom I think she
would enjoy that all right and then this
is the Marc Jacobs Marc Jacobs marvelous
mousse and bisque light I really like
this foundation I'm gonna keep that this
I got a nomini box this is by a company
called drew and I know it looks really
messy
um and I'm probably going to I have a
backup of this this one just looks old
and disgusting I think I'm gonna get rid
of this but I have a backup one they
sent me like a refill so I'll probably
keep the case and just throw away the
foundation so we'll put that in a throw
away but I think I'm gonna keep the case
this is the NYX tinted moisturizer I
didn't really enjoy this product so I'm
gonna get rid of that not too much of
that is gone so I might be able to pass
it out along this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay BB tinted moisturizer that also
belongs to John I'm gonna keep that this
is my Lumine time free CC anti-aging
color correcting cream this is one of my
faves I'm shipping that the bomb shelter
time bomb tinted moisturizer I haven't
used this much lately I haven't been
giving this enough look I use this a lot
right after I first got it and it's
definitely been neglected that I'm not
sure about that yet I'm gonna hold onto
that for a second let's see sunscreen
I'm gonna go ahead and keep that I'm
sure I'll use that over the next couple
of weeks the Marcel BB cream a golden
glow I don't
did I use this I'm not sure but I don't
need this I'm gonna pass that along
oh here's another one of those IntelliJ
will throw that in the box and give that
away to somebody I swear I've gotten
this product in subscription boxes like
four times I've already tried it so
we'll pass it along to someone that's
never tried
all right this is the Becca radiant skin
satin finished foundation in bamboo I
got this way too dark
see now I'm thinking I'm gonna have to
decide between these two of which one
I'm gonna keep because I don't need both
this but they're different though so
this one's definitely cooler and this
one's definitely warmer ah which one do
I choose I don't know I'm gonna keep
them both no I can't give them both now
I have to get rid of one of them I'm
gonna keep this one because of the tone
for contouring and I'm gonna pass this
one along oh it breaks my heart oh no I
hate this okay bareMinerals bare skin I
really like that foundation I'm gonna
keep it
this pond BB cream they don't make
anymore and I love this stuff I do a mix
of the light and the medium I'm
definitely keeping that no doubt about
it
here's another packet of the S floor
I've tried there's so many times I'm
gonna go ahead and pass along so
soothing refining cleanser that was in
the wrong drawer but we'll pass that
along this is the Dior star whatever
foundation this is the doer skin star
foundation in 23 this is John's so put
that over there the wet and wild cover
all I think this is John's but he's got
enough product isn't need all that I'm
gonna get rid of that I'll double check
with it when he gets back the Revlon
nearly naked this was an okay product it
definitely wasn't my favorite product
that I've ever used but I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of that because it's
kind of old Smashbox camera ready BB
cream this is a really nice BB cream mmm
there probably isn't much left I can
probably use that up we'll put this in I
need to use this up very quickly
dror Garnier BB cream love the stuff
definitely keeping that this is the
Estee Lauder Double Wear I love this
love love love this this is in the shade
Frisco fresco and I got this on a trade
on a tip and I don't love it I
absolutely love it even if you don't
know he's a makeup trading website kind
of sketched me out to get foundation but
she said it was new and it was new when
I got it so I really really love this
foundation so I'm keeping that the city
color mineral foundation I hated this
product it was horrible it was very very
pink from my skin tone and it just
coverage was not there just that and it
just looked terrible on my skin so this
is definitely a throw away the
show me some skin weightless foundation
I'm gonna try to pass this along to
someone I really don't enjoy this
product very much I don't reach for it
it's got like it says it's very it shows
some skin it doesn't have very much
coverage and I really don't enjoy using
this product so I'm gonna get rid of
that the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte I
really love this foundation I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that that's got a really
nice coverage drugstore fantastic this
is another one this is my Holy Grail
right now maybelline fit me matte and
poreless foundation for drugstore
absolutely love love love this
foundation speaking of holy girls we'll
go to the hourglass immaculate I love
this foundation as well this is in the
shade nude oh my goodness fabulous
liquid to matte coverage coverage is
about medium so but this is like that I
definitely not finish that you get and I
really love this foundation without
making it look too flat this is another
one that I really love that doesn't give
it enough love I really need to put this
in the front of my drawer because it's
starting to get a little bit old but
this is the l'oreal and visible lift
blur foundation i really love the way
this feels it's a silicon based
foundation stays on a really long time
and gives a beautiful beautiful
beautiful look so I'm gonna keep that
this is the Tarte BB cream I think they
guys ever use this I'm gonna put this in
the front two of things to keep man I'm
not getting rid of a whole lot all right
super goop SPF everyday sunscreen I'm
gonna use these yeah I'm gonna use these
up for the end of the summer there's you
where this is pretty much empty this is
as you air luminizing moisture tint
sunscreen SPF it's a tinted moisturizer
so I'm going to throw that away that's
not usable anymore I have two of these
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizers this
one feels pretty much empty I'm gonna
keep that this one feels full I'm gonna
pass that along the owl makes smart
shake makeup I did not enjoy this
product and it's it just doesn't have
its it's in like medium but it has like
no coverage at all I didn't I didn't
enjoy this product so I'm gonna get rid
of that the time bomb foundation I
really love this stuff another it's very
similar to the Marc Jacobs in the
formula of it
do you feel like the Marc Jacob has is
goes on a little bit prettier than the
time bomb
timebomb is very nice I'm gonna keep
that as well I'm actually going to I'm
gonna pass along I don't know these are
the NYX mineral foundation Stix
I actually really like these I got these
from my friend Lea she she went to the
Knicks after-party not this past IMATS
but the IMATS before and she got a
goodie bag so she got a bunch of really
great Nick stuff but she couldn't wear
these she's a much darker skin tone than
I am
so she could not wear these so she
passed them along to me and I do like
kind of a mix of these two and I
actually really like these I'm gonna
keep these the Tony moly BCD BCD I've
tried this product and I really enjoy it
so I'm gonna pass it along this is the
AE funkhouser
like luxe liked revitalizing foundation
I got this for promo you can see that
the cap is cracked it's very messy
looking but I did real I did enjoy this
but I don't feel comfortable passing it
on I'm gonna put this in the front as
well and try to use this up this is the
trick trish mcevoy oil we said strong
trish mcevoy even your skin foundation i
got this from my friend Lily Spurgeon
she sent this to me on it's way too dark
for my skin tone so I'm gonna see if I
can pass that along I did like the way
that it felt but it's way too dark for
my skin tone so unfortunately I can't
use it this is the Laura Mercier smooth
finish flawless I don't know smooth
finish Laura Mercier something another
in French I've never tried this it's got
like a little ball in there I don't know
I've never used this it's a shake well
to activate beef yeah shake ball to
activate I don't know I guess it's like
a liquid foundation but I've never used
this I'm just gonna go ahead and pass
that along the NYX invincible fullest
coverage foundation I also got this from
Lee she this is getting old and I don't
remember enjoying this very much so I'm
gonna get rid of that let's see what
what in the world to have two of these I
thought I'd talk oh it's safe for later
that's right this is my Yves pearl
foundation I really really like this a
lot this also needs to go in the front
because this is a little over a year old
and I want to get this used up it's a
really nice foundation you're supposed
to do reverse contouring with this I
don't I
they showed me at a time ATS not last
year a year before they showed me how to
do this and
haven't put love into this I mean I've
obviously hit pan so I can probably use
this up pretty quickly but I remember
really like this foundation it just kind
of got shoved in the back of the drawer
so we'll go ahead and keep that for some
some how this got in there I think Lily
sent this to me as well this is the
Chanel I makeup remover so this will go
on my bathroom I'll definitely use that
and then I think I had this in my
skincare videos while these black teen
age delay eye concentrates buy fresh
I've tried this before I enjoy it so I'm
gonna go ahead and pass that along so
that's it
that's it already yeah okay so let's
show you the damage you haven't fun
watching me declutter is it joyful for
you watching me do this yes mom I like
watching you declutter okay so anyway so
these are the things that I'm keeping I
know that that still looks like a lot
but I'm getting rid of a lot of things
I'm getting rid of almost half of what I
had so I feel like I still did pretty
well I don't I don't feel like I did
great but there still are a lot of
products in here that I want to use I
shouldn't stop buying things you know I
know you know I know you understand
because you get me but I am getting rid
of all of that so that makes me happy
and my drawer will be a lot lighter so
thank you so much for watching if you
enjoyed this decluttering video make
sure that you subscribe so you don't
miss mix my next one which is going to
be blushes which is gonna be my hardest
one ever because blushes are like my
fave blush and eye shadow or like my
things so that's gonna be really
difficult so stay tuned for that one mad
love and I'll see you soon so here is
the after Oh a little bit more cleanse a
