hello my friends welcome to my no makeup
face this is gonna be a declutter ring
series that I'm starting with the least
painful drawer that's my skincare drawer
I get all these subscription boxes it
gives me all these kinds of skincare it
takes me like a good solid week to two
weeks sometimes a month to try a
skincare product so as a result I end up
with a ton of unopened unused skincare
all right so I have a ton of stuff in
here
some is brand new some is not what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the
stuff out of this drawer I'm going to
throw it on my bed and I'm gonna sort it
okay so I've sorted these out so this
stuff is gonna be trash this stuff is
just not good or actually you know what
this one is this more put over here like
this right here is a tooth whitening pen
I'm totally using that that's mine these
are makeup products these are like blush
samples so I'm not giving those away and
this is just disgusting look at this you
see that it's like all separated and
nasty so that's going in the trash so
this this over here that stuff I'm not
doing anything with I feel like I'm
looking at the monitor instead of
looking at you I'm gonna look at you
okay so over here is all of my body
stuff
this is hands and foot and then this is
all home the face products I know some
of it it's out of the shot we pull a
little closer to you so you can see all
of the face products I mean this is just
this is stupid okay and I know I'm gonna
get more stuff so I'm gonna get rid of
most of this and I'm gonna divide it
amongst a bunch of people I'm just gonna
randomly just go box box box box and one
box is gonna be free giveaway for one of
you watching so I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom in and show you what I've got and
what I'm getting rid of okay so let's
start with the biggest demon of all
which is the face stuff we'll push the
body stuff there okay so a lot of the
stuff I got from subscription boxes and
from companies sending me PR samples
things like that and I I'm not gonna use
most of it I am grateful for everything
that I have is something I'm not
grateful I just want to give it a good
home and I know I can't go through this
in a timely manner so I'd rather give it
to someone that can use it now okay the
first product here is this palm meadow
collagen booster restorations you know I
actually am using one of these right now
and it's an okay product it's not my
favorite
it feels a little bit sticky it's but
it's really I mean I already use it so I
don't need that so I'm going to be
giving that away okay this is the buxom
show some skin weightless foundation
sample giving that away this was from a
mini box this is a rice bran powder pack
it's I don't really understand how it
works or what you do with it it's all in
Korean yeah I forget what to do with
this it's a powder I think you mix it
with water and scrub it on your face so
that's gonna go
and hopefully somebody can make some
good use for this is the Olay tone
perfecting cream gonna get rid of that

anti stretch therapy mask I don't really
like masks very much they're not my

Barnes of eternity body lotion how much

already I don't know this is the Kerstin
Florian lavender body spray I'm not
really in need of something like that
I'm gonna pass that Nivea in-shower body

this is the pile of stuff that I'm
keeping there is that and then this is
the pile of stuff that I am giving away
sorry gifting so I feel like I did
really really well but again this was
the easiest one for me like this was
this was definitely the easiest because
I don't really need a lot of skincare I
mean that is plenty of skincare to last
me a year I mean really and truly this I
don't need all that I mean there might
be some fantastic products in there they
would be wonderful to try I mean this
