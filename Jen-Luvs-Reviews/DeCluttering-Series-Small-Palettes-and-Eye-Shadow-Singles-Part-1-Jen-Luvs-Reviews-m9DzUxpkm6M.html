section of my decluttering series this
is going to be another hard one I love
my eyeshadows single eyeshadows you know
there are some days I just reach for
only single eyeshadows some days I do a
mix of a palette and a single eyeshadow
sometimes I just do palettes but I
really have too many single eyeshadows
in order to make good use of them so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter this now
and I'm so nervous
I really want to do good on this one I
really want to do well so let's go ahead
and see how I do this is just stupid
like who in the world is ever going to
use this much eyeshadow and their entire
life like really and truly if I use
these products every day and never
bought another eyeshadow again for the
rest of my life I think I would still
have more left and that's not even
counting eyeshadow palettes I have this
is just stupid so I'm gonna need to get
rid of some of this stuff now this is
really difficult for me because I
absolutely love my eyeshadow obviously
so it's gonna be hard for me to go
through this so please bear with me as I
go through a lot of pain okay so the
first thing here is this Malley Brown
stone I shout out this is absolutely
gorgeous I never use it I never use it
and I think that part of the reason why
is because this drawer is just so
cluttered with stuff I'm gonna hold off
on that for a minute oh my gosh this is
gonna be harder than I thought it was
gonna be I find it was gonna be hard but
it's gonna be even harder okay so hmm
okay this is in the wrong section this
should have been with my eyeshadow
palettes I'm gonna keep this this is
brand new and I haven't given it enough
love and I want to love this some more
so I'm gonna go ahead and hold on to
that okay other things I'm gonna hold on
to I know I'm gonna keep my wet and wild
comfort zone palette that is a
no-brainer these were given to me by the
lovely ELISA and I will link releases
channel down below these were limited
edition wet and wild eyeshadow palettes
and I've really liked these alone gosh I
never use them though I'm gonna keep up
I'm gonna keep them oh my gosh I need to
stop okay I never use this next one even
though it's we actually really like it a
lot I never use it so I'm gonna go ahead
and pass that on this is the white
Lightning brow bar to go this is
actually in the wrong drawer but I did
not enjoy this product it was not
pigmented enough for me I did not enjoy
it at all I'm gonna go ahead and pass it
on to somebody and see if they can get
some more love out of it so I'm gonna
pass it on I also know that I'm gonna be
passing this on this is the sex-bomb
eyeshadow palette I don't think this is
this is brand new it's never even been
opened but I just I know I'm not gonna
use it just the shades I just I just
know I'm not gonna use it I'm gonna pass
that along I really like this at one
point these are really nice highlight
colors but I have a million of these so
I'm gonna pass this on to someone that
can give it more love and it breaks my
heart but I think I'm gonna get rid of
this as well this is the Kat Von D this
is a shade shifting eyeshadow and it's
really really pretty I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch it for you it is gorgeous but
I know I'm not gonna use it and I know
there's someone out there that will be
able to use it more than me so I'm gonna
go ahead and pass that along okay same
thing with this NYX eyeshadow trio I
don't use it enough and I have other
shades that are similar so I'm gonna
pass that along even though this is
gorgeous and awesome this everyday
minerals kit I got this I think there's
one there's one missing but I don't know
maybe I'll find it in the mix but these
are just natural eye shadows there's
some beautiful ones in here I'm gonna
pass this whole kit along to somebody
these so you'd see there's like this
this maroonish purplish kind of color
there's a deep brown there's this
highlight color this one's really pretty
I mean it's gorgeous I just know I'm not
going to reach for it and then I was
just like you know kind of matte Brown
nice crease color and another one these
are beautiful but I know I'm not gonna
use them so I'm gonna pass them on to
someone that is going to use them Oh
dying here okay this is another one that
was sent to me by I think the Lisa sent
this to me as well I don't think I'm
gonna use these as well these this was
another limited edition this is called
zero dark and flirty it was a wet and
wild palette I think I used it twice and
listening for beauty this is another
really good one because I so many
neutral eye shadows I'm gonna pass
the stupid trees again oh my goodness if
you didn't watch my blush video they're
chopping down let me show you they're
chopping down trees next door and I
tried to come back after they were done
but apparently they're not done so
please excuse the tree noises in the
background I'm moving and I only have so
much time to get this done when the kids
aren't home so I need to keep going even
though there's noise in the background
so please excuse I'm gonna try not to
talk about it anymore because I know
I've already apologized but oh my gosh
okay so this is another one I'm not sure
if I'm gonna pass the song let me swatch
this I only use this once I bought it I
spent money on it I only used it once oh
my gosh I don't think I can get rid of
that
okay I'm gonna save it for now and then
if I don't use it I'm gonna get rid of
it I know that sounds kind of weird but
I gotta do something about that
alright this Coastal Scents this is just
an empty shadow palette this I think can
fit Mac pans as well should I keep this
no I'm not gonna keep this just in case
I'm gonna get rid of it
okay the Mac go palette a Mac this is a
Coastal Scents go palette in Cairo I got
this I think in a subscription box I
never use it I'm gonna pass it on this I
believe is John's this is the Wet n Wild
Fergie when he was doing his beauty
channel which he hasn't done in a while
because he just doesn't have time
anymore
but I think this is his I'm gonna check
by him and see if it's okay to get rid
of this but but if it was up to me I'd
get rid of this I don't know I just I
have other colors that are like that and
I never used bright colors like this and
if I do I'm I have other things I can
use so this here this I didn't I know I
didn't use a whole lot this is by
Elizabeth grant I gotten a kid off a
hautelook and look how beautiful look
how beautiful and I've used it what
twice I'm gonna want onto it for now I
mean just beautiful
they're not super pigmented though are
they okay all right I'm gonna pass this
on now after swatching I mean I did very
light swatches mmm no you know what I'm
gonna try it one more time and then
possibly pass this on I don't know I
might keep that we'll hold on to that
for now
okay these also belonged to John these
are Maybelline eyeshadow palettes I'm
gonna hold onto those for him and see if
he wants to keep them I lost this and
now I'm glad that I have it this is the
bomb's brow pal I really like this brow
powder I'm gonna keep that it's fab
alright glamorous chick's cosmetics I
got a bunch of these IMATS and I've
never really used them they're
supposedly you can make nail polish out
of them all kinds of stuff I feel like I
didn't give them enough love so I'm
gonna save the glamour check at least
this one because I know this is a more
usable color I've some brighter ones but
I don't know if I'm gonna keep or not
but I'm maybe not I don't know I'm
having trouble putting a lid on straight
I'm gonna hold off on that one
okay these little Coastal Scents little
quads I'm gonna go ahead and pass that
along this here is the cool as a
cucumber this was one of my first
eyeshadow palettes when I first started
getting back into makeup like series
hardcore and makeup it's a nice palette
I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna keep it I
like it this is the NYX Sunkist I don't
know what they call it they call it a
radiant finishing powder I never use
this I'm gonna pass that along I
probably should have been in my blush
video this is the did you wear moonlight
and this is a long wear cream mousse
eyeshadow and this is basically just
glitter it's gorgeous but it's just
glitter I don't use it much I'm gonna
pass that along let's see these are the
glamorous Chicks ones that I never use
I'm gonna pass those along to somebody
that I think would use them so I'm gonna
go it's say this one is in star by night
I'm scared to open these and spill them
all over my bed but this is just it's
too it's too dark I'm never gonna use
this I'm never going to reach for it I'm
never going to use it and then this one
here is in mink mm I might keep this one
okay I'm gonna keep it for now I'm gonna
keep it I'm gonna keep all right okay
this one is who makes this this is oh
city color and I don't remember
oh this was really messy and weird
alright that's gorgeous that's really
pretty I don't think I gave that enough
love I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
hey glamorous chicks did I save the
other glamorous chicks one this is the
one I just talked about all right I'm
gonna I'm gonna go ahead and save this
for now I might change my mind later all
right this is kind of old I don't feel
comfortable passing this along this is a
Mirabella quad and it's called the
jewelry box collection and I really like
this while I was using it but I haven't
used it much lately I don't know I don't
I think this is old I think I'm gonna
get rid of this because this is pretty
old okay this is oh my gosh the model in
a bottle lipstick stealer I meant to do
a video on this this is the most painful
product oh my gosh I meant to do a whole
video on this like a year ago and I
never did but oh my gosh this stuff
hurts like no joke is painful I use it
once and I was like oh it's terrible
it's supposed to make your lipstick stay
on longer but it's incredibly painful I
don't know what I'm gonna do with that
I'll see if anybody wants it but I think
I'm just gonna get rid of it it hurts so
okay this right here I'm definitely
keeping this is something I will
probably keep forever this was my
grandmother's eyeshadow quad that I got
when she passed away and I don't use it
but it reminds me of her so I just keep
it in my makeup just so that she you
know I don't know I feel like she's with
me when I have this I don't know I don't
have much that belonged to my
grandmother so this is something that I
will always keep and this is um Estee
Lauder I believe or Lancome Lancome
arreste Lauder I'm not sure but anyway I
just absolutely love alright BH
Cosmetics California collection this is
actually a these are really nice shadows
oh what do i do I do
keeping it okay so you notice like I'm
keeping some I'm definitely gonna keep a
mix up high-end and drugstore ish brands
because honestly it's about the quality
it's not about the price it's about the
quality every once a while it's about
the price but for the most part it's
about the quality this was a Mirabella
single eyeshadow that I got in actually
I think it's a duo yes there's a matte
purple and then there's this cream color
that I got in a subscription box and I'm
gonna go ahead and pass it along because
I do have oh do I have Purple's like
that
Oh brah I don't know man I don't know I
don't know if I have purples like that
or not okay I'm gonna keep it for now
yeah okay this right here I know I'm
definitely getting rid of this is the
urban decay
this is space cowboy and I just never
use this it's so glittery and I just
never use it but I've been seeing some
beautiful looks with glitter lately and
now I'm like thinking I might want to
keep it mom okay I have two of them I
have this one I have this one I'm gonna
get rid of this one this one is in
stargazer I'm gonna get rid of this one
and I'm gonna keep this one because I
think I'm more likely to use this one
this one my aunt gave me it's a
covergirl one I think that it's old I
just I don't know I think she just gave
it to me because she knows I like makeup
and I don't know I think I'm gonna I
think I'm just gonna get rid of that
yeah I'm getting rid of that okay I'm
never going to use that in a million
years just it isn't gonna happen let me
swatch it just to make sure yeah it's
dry and powdery and it's just not a good
one okay gonna get rid of that another
one of these quads this is all broken up
I don't feel comfortable passing this
along to somebody it's like yeah I'm
gonna throw that one away - okay this
Clinique this was like one that I used
all the time before I had a big makeup
collection and I haven't used it in
forever I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
and play with it a little bit more and
then I might pass it along later but
that's kind of old I wouldn't know you
know what I'm not gonna pass along
because I know how old it is so I'm
gonna keep it I'm keeping it
okay this here this is the Maybelline
eye studio quad in Sunset seduction
really really like this quad I'm gonna
keep that this one however I know I will
not use it's a nice quad but I know I
won't use it so I'm gonna go ahead and
pass them all it's so dirty I can't pass
that to anybody look at this thing
and one of the shadows popped out I
can't pass it along to anybody I guess
that's just gonna stay in my collection
because I can't pass it along and I
don't want to throw it away so we'll
keep that all right this is a julep
shadow well it's an orbital eyeshadow I
should say and this is called earth
shine and it's so stinkin pretty will I
use it though that's the question
will I actually use this I'm not going

think belongs to John as well I'm gonna
go ahead and put that over there for him

this yellowish bill way I'm gonna go
ahead and keep this I really really like
this a lot so just beautiful beautiful
beautiful keepin it okay these
bareMinerals 5 and 1 BB advanced
performance cream eyeshadows when I
first got these I really really liked
them a lot and then they got shoved in
the back of the drawer and I never use
them again so I'm gonna go ahead and
keep these and give these a little bit
more low all right this here I got in as
four points for epsy points and I have
not used it yet but it's like it's just
not a functional product I don't know
what the deal is with this this is by
Vincent Longo and it this is in ambrosia
mist and it's like what is that what is
that even supposed to be like I I just
don't get this product at all like it's
like a cream but then when you go like
that it goes away I don't I don't get
this product I'm just gonna get rid of
