am doing a video or at least daring to
do a video I haven't done it yet with
three different beauty boxes this is a
first for me I'm going to start with the
one that I got first and that is boxy
charm now by the charm when i first
started getting it they said that it was
going to all drugstore items it's gonna
be all full size now we're started
starting to change a little bit it's
changing into six to seven up mostly
full sized items last month we got some
stuff from be a bombshell which I was
really surprised to get it which I only
would not consider be a bombshell a
drugstore product so I have no idea at
this point what boxy charm is doing what
their plan is but it's definitely
changing and I think that people were
getting a little disappointed with some
of the drugstore products they were
getting that they weren't as
high-quality as they had hoped for the
$21 subscription service I have gotten
some really good items in this but I'm
gonna stop rambling and I'm actually
gonna open the box now go ahead and open
that up I'm excited okay and the theme
this month is winter wonderlands and I'm
not going to read it because it gives me
clues to what's in here kunis facial
masks Oh probably gonna get a face mask
i hate phase fast i always pass them on
to my friend mary lynn who loves face
mask so i know it's one of those
personal preference things and then
there's something novex brazilian
keratin which is something i've never
heard of so we'll see what the deal is
with that with the qunut cow colonists
tonus i can't pronounce ika you and I
asked it is thirty percent off your
first order on their website this is
really pretty i love the light blue it
just reminds me of snowflakes and all
that first thing I'm seeing is another
Nick's trio we had gotten one before
that was all a lot of different whites
and only the center one was of high
quality so I'm curious to see what the
deals with this one they're definitely
really pretty shades beanie red bronze
and red bean look like the colors there
and I will swatch these who that first
one feels nice second one feels the same
third one feels and they all feel very
creamy maybe a little
battery on that last one and we will
swatch you beautiful all three are
beautiful wonderful very excited about
this just really nice colors can be used
for any season I really like this of
course is a really nice brow bone color
these can be really nice but believe it
or not blended up into the crease I've
seen a lot of tutorials with Burgundy's
and pinks blend up the creasing is just
gorgeous so very happy to have that we
got another offer at lip gloss and we
might even gotten this exact one before
it looks very similar I'm going to go
check and see which 1i have and see if
it's the same one for the packaging is
different it looks like yep the only
difference is is that the bottle is a
little bigger so that the product fills
up completely but it's the same oh and
also it's actually printed on the
printing is actually on the tube and
this is a sticker so they've upgraded
their packaging but the exact same
product in the exact same color I
definitely like it it's got a little bit
of a mint eNOS to it but it's a
beautiful color I will swatch the one
that I have so you can see what looks
like i'm not gonna swatch that one and
that is what that looks like it's just
like a deep burgundy kind of color and
will do what i usually do when i have a
product that i am not going to use that
I think is of high quality I'm going to
give this to the first person that
comments down below that they would like
lip gloss so it can be yours first
person down below I will comment to you
and let you know that you want it and
then send me your address and i will
send it to you yay okay so this you know
it's a nice lip gloss it's just I
already have one next up oh my goodness
Mirabella love Mirabella I don't know if
you guys have ever heard of Mirabella
but Mirabella I see a lot on hautelook
and I've gotten things from Mirabella in
beauty boxes before and I loved
everything that I've gotten from your
bill I have one of their blushes have
some of their eyeshadows really like it
this is a lash essential mascara and I'm
not going to open this because I have a
lot of mascaras open and I have some
waiting in line that I want to try
including all one by em cosmetics so I'm
not going to open this but I am going to
keep it for future the novex product and
it is brazilian keratin food therapy
extra deep hair care cream so after you
shampoo you put on your moist hair
and you leave it on for 25 minutes in a
plastic metallo a cap or 15 minutes with
a salon vaporizer really come on guys
really like I got the salon vaporizer
hanging out in my bedroom that I can use
and what is this what is this this this
metallo a cap like I got one of those
either come on wait really okay i guess
i'm going to Sally Peter supply and
asking them what the world is a metallic
cap if you know what it is but in a
comment down below because I have no
idea and we have the face mask this is
the Kunis soothing facial mask balances
for glowing silky skin heightens
moisture relaxes firms and relaxes and
firms contains organic ingredients and
this will be passed on to my friend
Marilyn hi Marilyn if two more products
in here this one is a sweet vanilla lip
balm ER with a different arena lip balm
and elytte Ballmer is and this one is in
its by mission and it's SPF 15 and it's
in the scent sweet vanilla and I'm
always up for new lip balms always
always always smells good should I put
on my lips I have em cosmetics lipstick
on right now it's a nude nude lace I
think is what it's called I'll put it on
anyway feels nice I so let me bum
they're happy with that and then last I
see a l'oreal nail polish and i do like
this formula it's in very nice it's
number 607 and i'm really excited to get
that very cool let's open it up and see
the consistency of it looks a little
watery like it's going to be pretty
sheer but we shall see hopefully it is
better than what i'm thinking as far as
the little drippy drip I just solved so
overall I'm going to call this box a win
but we're going to see how it compares
to the other boxes and remember again
this one is twice as expensive as the
other boxes let's move on to birchbox
because this one was shipped to my house
next and it says sparkle and shine on
the front of it which is very cute and
then inside the ax think paper like
usual
is introducing cynthia rowley beauty
first thing I see is shampoo and
conditioner by Beauty protector which is
a company I've never heard of protect
and shampoo and predict and conditioned
very cute little packaging sulfate free
paraben free well this one's sulfate
free pair have been free for all hair
types they're vegan you know okay sure
we'll try them not very excited about
shampoo and conditioner though next up a
little teeny tiny grandcentral beauty
smarts skin perfecting polisher ok so
it's an exfoliator that you use and wash
off ok very very small sample that which
makes me a little sad but this last me a
little while this probably lasts me four
or five uses next I see Birchbox goes
mobile twenty percent off your next
purchase in our shop download the iphone
app okay ooh this is cute you know
people complain they get all these
colored club nail polishes in their
birch boxes but I've had Birchbox very
long so I don't have many so I am
excited to try this this one is in
baldwin blues and we'll see the
consistency here this one looks pretty
thick this is probably a to cook polish
where the other one looks like it's
probably three or four coat polish the
l'oreal one so this one looks really
cool i like that shade i don't have any
colors that are that color so excited
about that and then last in here is
probably a little food bonus and this is
a honeycomb choco pie mini chocolate bar
luscious amber honey caramelized into
crisp bits and in robed in dark
chocolate and I'm gonna eat this rat now
because it looks delicious and I can't
not eat something that sounds like that
so that's what that looks like a shrug
um I think they saw my last birchbox
opening video not really but I think
they might have seen it and then seeing
that I got tea instead of chocolate and
I was all upset it didn't get chocolate
I'm very happy got chocolate this time
so a row with Birchbox ten dollars a
month what did I get not a whole lot
feel like i didn't get everything is it
perfect i'm supposed to be five things
did I miss something
one two or three four no uh-uh so all i
got was for things i got the to the
shampoo in the conditioner I got the
exfoliator and I got the nail polish so
right now I'm excited about is the
chocolate and I guess the nail polish so
I definitely don't think I got ten
dollars with the stuff that I like in
here so far definitely I think that boxy
charm is definitely winning over
Birchbox let's check out if see up with
the link down below to last december's
if see bag it was amazing so let's get
into the city bag I'm so excited okay
okay first thing i got was a Beauty
Blender and I got this as a 1,000 point
perk which was for referrals so thank
you to those of you who have used my
Ipsy lengths in order to sign up for an
Ipsy account because of you I got a
Beauty Blender and I do have one of
these and it is amazing I think that is
totally worth the hype I have heard the
Real Techniques one from was it wehmeyer
01 I forget who it was but one of my
subscribers in a video recently told me
that the real Tecna techniques one was
just as good as this one so I definitely
plan on checking that out but in the
meantime I do have this one which I'm
really excited about is the one that I
have is really dirty and I really want
to try the cleanser to see if it's
actually worth the price I know that
brush cleaner does not work in cleaning
it i also got yep i also got a sample of
the bad gal lash because I'd watched a
video which again of course I forgot who
it was and it sucks that I forgot but
someone told me that this was a really
good mascara so I wanted to try that and
then Oh something outside the bag I got
a new I got a near abella I blender
blending brush we just saw me relevant
ago I just told you how would you like
Mirabella so excited to have this feels
very soft so far it's very heavy very
heavy definitely not dense really good
it's going to be good for just blending
up into the crease just very light um if
I have a very dark color this would be
nice to put on so that it doesn't um
it's not super pigmented but yeah really
excited about this it
he's starting off good people starting
off good and then I have watched a
couple of bag opening so I have seen the
bag this bag is so stinking cute it
feels very very very high quality and it
does have a little ape see little thingy
here on the zipper I was hoping I would
get one of these this is by Nick okay or
nikka k and it is a nail polish it is a
topi kind of color will open that and it
looks like it will probably be a two to
three coat polish which makes me happy I
don't I don't I really prefer a one or
two coat polish but I can handle three
couples with you push it to four I get
it a little irritated but this actually
it looks really pretty i love the
packaging it's very unique very sleek
and classy looking excited about that
okay I wasn't sure I was going to get
this either be a bombshell and I
generally really like their products and
this is called a one stick and I got the
shape flustered open this baby up see
what it is and I believe this is for
cheek and lips and I got like a reddish
kind of color it's got a little bit of
glitter in it I think gold is it gold
it's really hard to tell what color the
glitters are but it is a very very
bright shade this will probably look
better as a lip color but it looks like
it blends out nicely for a cheek color
we shall see I will keep you posted on
that if it's amazing i will let you know
huh a trio by pop beauty i'm happy to
get the brown i saw they also had grazed
i will tell you that i have never liked
a single product i've gotten from pop
beauty or pixi actually that's not true
i did like one of their lip products
once but pretty much everything I've
hated from this brand so I do not have
high hopes for the pigmentation on these
shadows let me see the colors it just
says a naturally bear eyeshadow trio I
just feel actually pretty nice I'm
shocked and Shaq people shocked all
right let's put on right here these are
actually really pretty I am shocked the
one that I actually liked the least so
far is the lightest one here but those
are actually really pretty it's like a
bronze and then like a
hope seriously go hey pop beauty with
your bad pop self get some good eye
shadows going on I am shocked that I
like this for you pop beauty last thing
i got was a NYX lip stick and I think
this is one of the round lipsticks in
mute mmm I don't know about this color
whoa no no I am never going to wear this
this is never a a frosty like no this is
a frosty know is what this is but that's
the only thing I don't like that's it
right yep so for ypsi I hate this NYX
lip stick absolute it i'm nots watching
it it's a horrible color excited about
this lip cheek combo thingy excited
about the eyeshadows excited about the
nail polish and excited about the brush
