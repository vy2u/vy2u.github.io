impression review of the deck of
Scarlett I am so excited to review this
for you it has been highly requested on
the channel and I cannot wait to tell
you all about the subscription service
so like I mentioned a bunch of people
asked me to review this and when they
contacted me and asked me if I want to
do a sponsor video of them almost like
yes definitely because I knew that they
was interest there I've seen this all
over YouTube it's always in
collaboration with youtubers so it's
everywhere and you know me I like to
know for myself whether something is
good or not you know so let me give you
a little bit of information about deco
Scarlett it is 29.95 and it is a buying
monthly subscription so you'll get a
palette one month and then the next
month they give you a preview of the
following palette and you get to decide
whether you want to purchase it or not
and if you don't want it you can skip it
and then the next month you'll get your
palette so it's every other month that
they have a palette available for
purchase every palette is different and
every palette in limited edition all of
the products that come in deco scarlet
are full-size and and you get eight to
nine products every month which comes
out about the about 3.33 cents per
product if you get nine products which
is an insane deal if you're out buying
an eyeliner to get one for three dollars
and thirty cents we're talking low-level
drugstore prices here so it's very
inexpensive when you look at it on the
whole deck of scarlet as a brand is
cruelty free they do have the little
PETA bunny on the back of their products
they're paraben free they're made in the
USA and the palette does have a 12-month
expiration little symbol on the back of
it I did notice on their website you can
buy the palettes individually if you're
not subscribed there 4495 a piece and
they but they're only available until
they sell out so let's go ahead and get
into what you get in the deck of scarlet
for your thirty dollars I'm shipping is
included within the $30 by the way so
when you open it up you get this little
card and it's that this one says meet
Evan wah but hopefully I said her name
correctly she is abhrush and about a
million subscribers she's one of those
ridiculously pretty people if I ever saw
her on the street I would probably do
like a double take because she just
wouldn't look like a real person because
she's like is that pretty you know what
I mean
she's very talented I was watching one
of her tutorials she did a fantastic job
in her tutorial but anyway so Evan was
the one that collaborate
on this pallet or this set of products
and you get this in this really nice
packaging it's got this foam here which
is fantastic because nothing is worse
than being excited about getting
something and everything that is broken
so it's nice that this is protected it's
also protected with this over top that I
didn't show you without to ever talk
when you get it and then you've got this
so let's go ahead and take out the
pallet and then you get two pencils will
show you those in a second so it comes
like this and this automatically
reminded me let's see maybe second what
does this remind you of okay it reminds
me of Fifty Shades of Grey did it remind
you of Fifty Shades of Grey totally
reminds me of that and it's really nice
got a little bit of a texture to it
right here it's very nice and then the
palette itself also has a little bit of
a texture here it's very soft nerdy kind
of packaging I forget what that's called
someone told me once what that was
called but I can't remember right now
and then it said death of scarlet here
and then the back it says deck of
scarlet Edition number one there were
two pallets before this one by Tully
Strack and then the other one was by
what's her name her name is Sandra
deluxe I have met Kelly before she's
super super nice but anyway so we open
this up and you have the little
protection here and one thing I really
love about this is they separate the
powder products from the cream products
which is fantastic you have the two
doors here the eye shadow or the powder
product door has a mirror on it and then
this one is for the lip products so
while you're using the powder products
you heat the lip product clothes you
don't get powder in your lip products
which is super super smart the magnetic
closure is very very nice on here just
feels a very very high quality I keep
saying very very how many times if I
said that after inside here we have a
highlighter named halo we have a bronzer
or contour called sandstorm we have an
eyeshadow called fudge and an eyeshadow
called mermaid we're going to talk a
little bit more about sunshine in a
minute they call this a face pigment and
we'll talk about that when we get into
ingredient analysis so this year under
here we have two lip products this one
is called coral kisses and this one is
called almond and these are all
full-size which is super awesome
you also get which one is this one this
is the eye liner and chameleon I'll put
a swatch of it from their website there
and then you get a lip liner in the
shade cakepops watch there they're both
roll-ups so you go like these and you
can roll them upward
which is very very nice and the
packaging is pretty standard the top
really goes on nicely sometimes I'll get
pencils where the top doesn't click on
very well and they open up and they make
a mess these click on very nicely which
is great and they say deck of scarlet or
on them so let's go ahead and get into
the ingredients so the first thing is
the eyeshadows do contain calcium
phenoxyethanol they're irritants to some
people there and pretty much every
single make a product ever made so if
you are allergic to Talcher
phenoxyethanol I'm very sorry for you
that's it's in this and everything else
and if I ever find a product that
doesn't have those ingredients I will be
sure to let you know and I'm sorry in
the shade fudge we have something called
BHT I did want to mention this it is
rated as a 6 on Environmental Working
Group but from the research that I did
it seems to be kind of bunk in that the
research really is about when you ingest
it rather than when you're putting it on
your face NIH the National Institute of
Health says that it's finding cosmetics
because of the low concentration of this
ingredient that's in cosmetics so I'm
not worried about that one VHT is also
in the eye liner and also the lip liner
but again I'm not worried about that
ingredient the shade mermaid has ferric
ferrocyanide in it so it is not lip safe
don't put that on your lips
now the shade sunshine has an ingredient
in it called red six now red six was
also in the Urban Decay electric palette
and people were upset that they'd use
red six in the article Expo because red
six is not not eye safe I know a lot of
people use the shades from the Urban
Decay electric palette on their eyes and
I know that people are going to be using
sunshine on their eyes but just so you
know the FDA does say that this
particular ingredient is not eye safe
now along with that sometimes people
will use lip products on their eyes as
eyeliner and just so you know coral
kisses has red seven in it which is not
I saved and the lift in almond has red
six in it as well so that one is not I
safe when we look at the cheap products
we're just looking at talc and
phenoxyethanol
in the sandstorm so you can use that on
your eyes according to the FDA and then
the highlighter in halo has calc and
ultramarines and then ultramarines are
not not lip safe you can use halo on
your eyes it is eye safe but it is not
lip safe according to the pigments
in there now with the eyeliner in
chameleon it has something in here
called cyclo penta siloxane which is
found safe on human but it is found to
be bio accumulative in wildlife
especially when it's kind of washed down
the sink and gets into you know the
water system so what I would recommend
if you use the eye liner is to wipe it
off with a cotton pad instead of washing
it down the sink with makeup remover you
may want to wipe it off instead
also the eyeliner has ferric
ferrocyanide and it's not lips safe so
don't use the eyeliner on your lips and
then with the lip liner and cakepop it
does have the red six in it so again not
eye safe but I can't really imagine
someone using the the lip liner on their
eyes I'd be kind of a strange thing to
do but you never know and again this is
the information from the FDA are you
going to die if you don't follow these
probably not but the FDA does say it for
a reason so it's up to you what you want
to do you are of an age where you're
using makeup so I'm assuming you're
mature enough to make the decision of
what's best for you I am just providing
the information for you all right so now
it is time to go ahead and use these on
my face and see how they work I haven't
used it yet and I'm super excited to see
how they work I've heard such great
things zooming and getting all up close
and personal in my face
and now that I'm looking myself in the
monitor I'm realizing I didn't put on
any foundation or brows yet so I'm going
to go ahead put on my foundation brows
and I'll be right back we are back with
a monochromatic face okay so let's go
ahead and let's start with we're going
to try sandstorm up in the crease I
didn't put any primer on because I went
to not everybody own the primer and this
didn't come with a primer so we're going
to go Suns primer here we go that's very
nice and now we're going to go ahead and
put halo all over the lid it's so
simmering there's lots of powder tick
off that's not necessarily a bad thing
as long as you tap off your brush so
that's what I just did I have no I base
down so that is going to affect the
performance and that if I put a base
down it was mute out discoloration and
make the shadow more
papi let's just stick with mermaid and
fudge let's let's stick with the I
staple in the eyes here so we're going
to go ahead and let's put your mermaid
which is the green shade on the outer
half of the eye not super poppy and
we'll kind of blend that up into the
crease a little bit just take a fluffier
brush and just kind of blend that out a
little bit
and I'm going to take sandstorm and go
back over top of my brow bone just a
little bit make this a little higher
whoo that's a little too much a little
too much go back into halo and let's uh
go ahead and hit the brow bone real
quick okay so now I'm going to take a
pencil brush and I'm going to run fudge
up in the crease I do have some fallout
as you can see right here but that might
have been my fault for not tapping off
my brush very nice I'm a little
disappointed in mermaid and how it's not
really showing that green but it might
be because I didn't use the base because
you know it's all about them no stoppage
ends drop it right now no one wants to
hear that Jen I'm just trying to build
it build build I tell you so we're going
to go back into halo and just try to
build that too
that's not so bad now I don't know it's
still not as poppy as I hoped it would
be
look at that whoa see if we can just
brush that off a lot of it I can already
got my highlight rocking so that's a
good thing about using highlighter on
your odds that falls on your cheeks
you're good I'm going to go ahead and
hit off the other eye and try to make it
match I'm very much regretting not using
a primer or a base on this but between
when this goes live and when I film this
I will try it a few more times and I
will put more information description
boxes for
is using it other times with other
things so now we're going to go into the
lower lashline I'm going to go ahead and
put mermaid on the lower lash line on
the outer corner that is so pretty
that's really nice and maybe even a
little mermaid as a liner on the top
just a little bit you know what I'm
liking that I'm thinking I'm going to
put a little bit on with my fingertip
they're so soft I'm going to pop a
little bit with my fingertip whoa that
works there we go that's what I was
looking for there we go alright I'm
going to use halo with my fingertip and
see what happens yes ma'am okay we found
the trick look at the difference that is
a huge difference now hopefully I don't
blend it out when I get my brush in bold
I'm going to try to blend these colors
into each other but that definitely
looks much better oh it's gone again
darn it it looks like I'm trying to
blend them into each other not letting
each other
we're just blending away don't do that
we didn't just softer brush all right so
I'm going to pop this back on and then
this one back on see if that helps it's
going to be super gentle on the blend
super gentle
there we go whoo all right so let's go
ahead and go into the eyeliner in
chameleon and that's all we're going to
use for liner today okay taking a little
bit of effort to get this to go on my
eyes I do not expect it to be so green I
thought it was going to be more black
but that's kind of cool okay let's do
lip liner this is a very me shade it's
going to go with a lot of different lip
products
one thing I was reading about lipliner
because I'm not a big lip liner person
so it's probably obvious to you but that
as we get older our lip line starts
being less defined so a way to look
younger is to use a lip liner here we go
I like the lip liner this would be good
just by itself with a lip gloss over top
will be gorgeous I'm tempted to do that
but I want to show you what these lip
products look like so let's go ahead and
close up the powder products and I'm
going to open up these and let's go
ahead and since they didn't and they
don't include like a lip brush or
anything I'm just going to use my
fingers because not everybody has a lip
brush so I'm going to go ahead into
almond whoa holy moly that salt that was
not expecting that
okay I'm going to reopen this so I can
use the mirror oh wow
that is gorgeous man that is pretty that
is really pretty okay now this could
either mess it up or it could make it
look really cool I want to try sunshine
on the lips we're going to just put a
little bit in the center and see what
happens
because it's lip space oh that's
interesting
kind of like that it's like orange II
but not to orange it you know like I
would imagine that this orange would be
a little crazy for me so I think using
sunshine is definitely a way to get that
orange II look without being
overpowering I really like the way that
looks for real yes I'm going to go ahead
and use sandstorm as a contour and we're
going to see how that goes
nice jet noise I like it I like it a lot
that's fantastic
good job deck of scarlet I like that
sweetie okay so now we're going to go
into halo as a highlighter there's a pop
pop the pop pop this is definitely a
poppin highlight I'm not a big four so
it's hard for me to judge but I can see
ones that really accentuate my pores
this one's not so bad and I think them
to leave the cheeks at that just because
I want to use just the products in here
and I don't want them to be masked by
other products so this is the final look
up close definitely not instagram-worthy
because girlfriends not a makeup artist
but we're going to be able to see where
time without a primer and see how that
goes so alright so this is the final
look that I'm going to wear today I'm
purposely not wearing lashes because I
want to be able to see the wear time of
the eyeliner now it is quite late
because I was doing ingredient analysis
all morning I did the makeup men and all
that so it is exactly 3 o'clock let sure
if you can see that zoom in exactly 3
o'clock we are going to check back in at
the end of the evening and see how all
of this wore my first impression is that
overall everything was pretty easy to
work with except for the eye shadow on
the eyes I'd be really curious to see
how this stuff works over top of a base
I think that it might make a huge
difference as far as the pigmentation
especially over using like a white
pencil I think would be a really good
idea to use with this so I'm going to go
ahead and take my leave of you and I
will see you in about seven hours or so
it's for you it'll be about two seconds
so all right you ready for seven hours
of past
Ready Set all right we're back it's been
seven hours did it feel like seven hours
to you I know it did to me
it is 1001 now hopefully you can see
that my phone is now on sleepytime modes
so completing its art is it but it's
Chano 1:00 p.m. so I've got some mixed
feelings about the performance of this I
do feel like the shades that are meant
to the eyeshadows the fudge and the
mermaid did great
far as the lasting power the eyeliner
lasted really really well as well I
don't know if you can see that but it is
definitely still on there in hindsight I
wish I'd put it on my lower waterline to
see whether it lasted in the waterline
but I didn't do that I should have but
again I'm going to put any updated
information on this palette anything
else I learned about this time I will
put in the description but as far as it
lasted on the upper lashline it did a
fantastic job sandstorm also awesome as
far as the eyeshadow I can still see it
a little bit on the contour and usually
I don't have good luck with contour and
highlight shades lasting a long time on
my cheeks so I feel like the contour did
pretty well considering that I never
really have a contour lasts on me that
long and I guess we'll see it a little
bit now the highlight shade the shade
halo is a glitter bomb it's a glitter
bomb it is under my eyes from when I
patted on my lids which may have been
partly my fault for not tapping off my
brushing off and may have been maybe it
needs a glitter glue or a stickier base
or even a primer might be able to hold
on to it a little bit better then may
just been in my choice of application
for this video that may have messed that
up but I have glitter everywhere I mean
it's like glitter here glitter there
glitter all over the place as far as the
lip product we did go out to dinner with
our friend Natalie CQ who is visiting
from Brazil she's an amazing tattoo
artist I'll link her information down
below so you can check her out she's
amazing
but we went out to dinner and as soon as
I wet my lips two lip products was gone
which is typical of a typical lipstick I
didn't expect it to last longer than
that but the lipstick was very
comfortable there was no weird
patchiness or weird filming this or
anything crazy going on when it was
coming off I did it was pipe up through
at least three to four hours before we
ate dinner and nothing weird was
happening before then and it was very
comfortable so definite thumbs up on the
lip product for a typical lipstick it
was very nice and I love the shade the
shade was beautiful wasn't it so I'm
going to go ahead and zoom you back out
for some final thoughts so my final
thoughts on Dec of scarlet as a
subscription I think it is a phenomenal
deal a really
deal I think what really makes this good
is that you can skip a month so if you
look at this and you go oh my goodness I
will never wear that orange I will never
wear that green it's not going to happen
I'm never going to wear this orange you
can skip this one and it's no problem
you just have to make sure like I know
with other subscription you just have to
make sure you go on and skip it so you
can set a reminder on your phone I mean
with technology these days
super easy to be reminded to do things
with all of our technologies if it's a
pay less than four dollars per product I
mean that's pretty thick and amazing
it's a great way to grow your collection
the application was a little bit tough
as far as the blending on these shadows
but again I really think that might have
been just my lack of primer application
my you know you might be able use some
glitter glue you might wet the shadows
there's lots of things you can do to
play with it because this was the first
impression I can't do everything I had
to pick one way to do it but any updated
information I will put in the
description as I find out more about
this and for any information you need to
know about it but I have to say I'm very
surprised when my favorite things in
here was the lip product I love the way
that finicky hook juice is so pretty and
it's just so creamy and so comfortable
the lip product itself doesn't really
have a scent if I have to like pull
something out of it I'll only put it on
I'm trying to see if the lip product has
any scent and I'm doing the no mirror
makeup challenge right now find out I
have a mirror right here done I don't
taste anything I don't smell anything so
that's really different people that are
sensitive to scent I feel like you never
fully dressed without a smile like that
I feel right now with my lipstick I feel
so much better now
the thing about this is if you're paying
$30 or paying about a little over three
dollars a product maybe four dollars a
product so if you end up with even half
of it that you don't like then you're
looking at six to eight dollars a
product sort of things that you do like
so I mean even if you only end up liking
four things in here you're still
definitely getting your money's worth
because you're getting higher quality
than drugstore products which is what
drugstore products cost these days
they'll run you anywhere from eight to
twelve dollars for a product at the
drugstore now so the
I think this is $30 and you get this and
on top of that you get the eye liner and
the lip liner too like are you kidding
me it's an incredible incredible deal if
you end up seeing a youtuber that you
specifically want to support that lady's
upside down that's another way to get it
personally I would pay $30 just for the
eyeliner the lip liner and the bronzer
alone and then bonus with the lip
product and eyeshadows that I still want
to play with because I haven't given up
on them yet so I mean I definitely think
this is worth $30 I would love to know
what you think in the comments below
