impromptu video I just got off of chat I
do a weekly chat for my whatsapp and
makeup news show and we talked about
drugstore eyeshadow palettes this week
and I as I was cleaning up I was like
you know what I'm just gonna get rid of
some of these palettes I was like well I
might as well shoot a video showing you
me getting rid of them but if you'd like
more information about these palettes go
ahead and click the link down below
it'll take you to the chat it is kind of
long but you can kind of skip through it
fast forward when you see a pout that
you're interested in and and you know
hear more about what and why I'm
decluttered numb but we'll go through
them just very quickly about why I'm
decluttering certain ones and why I'm
keeping I'm gonna go ahead and just go
through each palette and I'm going to
tell you why I'm keeping it or why I'm
getting rid of it so this is the NYX the
to go palette lip palette and
dispensable and this is in the shade
wanderlust this is a fantastic palette
I'm keeping that great pigmentation rate
lasting power same with the NYX off/on
pump I'm keeping that it's wonderful
this is in the shade surreal great
quality from next NYX is very
hit-or-miss and quality these two happen
to be excellent palettes the morphe
brushes 35 and palette I'm actually
going to declutter this this is
something that I do not reach for it's
just the lasting power isn't great for
me they're good i shadow but they're not
great for me and for whatever reason I'm
just not reaching for it so I'm going to
get rid of that and pass that along I am
going to keep the one that I built
though from morphe this is the one that
I built
I like the shimmery shades from morphe
better than I like the the matte shades
this has more of the shimmery shade so I
am going to keep this one the revlon
coach thing not just nudes palette
romantics palettes i am going to
declutter this one I just don't reach
for it and the last empower isn't great
so I'm gonna pass that along this is the
NYX bak of a box of eyeshadows I have
had this thing forever this is the
palette that I let my kids play with so
I am going to keep this just for that
purpose but it isn't a bad eye shadow
palette it's just kind of old and you
know I don't reach for it but I'm gonna
keep it just for like play fun purposes
here the Coastal Scents revealed palates
I'm kind of torn about what I want to do
with these because they are nice to have
as comparison palettes but I think I'm
just going to use them for I think I'm
going to Club them based on what I would
use so we're gonna keep the original
reveal palette we're gonna pass along
the reveal to in the reveal three those
were not my favorites and I'm gonna keep
the revealed smoky palette this is the
absolute rose by Patrice I am going to
pass this along this is one that I don't
think I'm gonna reach for much even
though it is a nice eyeshadow palette
the the shades kind of money together
for me so I'm gonna go ahead and pass
that along I am going to keep the
essence all about grades feel like this
is a really nice gray eyeshadow palette
to have and I really enjoy using it it
is a supplemental palette because there
isn't a whole lot of variation of course
because it's the Grays but it's nice to
have Gray's on hand if I need them I'm
going to declutter the blush nudes
palette this is not a palette that I
reach for just the pigmentation just
isn't there there is a market for this
this is for people that want a very
neutral very light it's a great teenager
palette of great starter palette for
someone that isn't used to wearing
eyeshadow because you can't really mess
it up because the pigmentation just
isn't really popping on that one so I am
gonna get rid of this one so I think
someone else will love it more than I do
I am going to keep this Coastal Scents
eyeshadow palette that I built I really
like this a lot
I love the pigmentation of it it's kind
of my fault allit that I built so I'm
going to keep that the backstage
collection by Jessie's girl this is not
a good palette it's powdery it's just
not it's not doesn't have good
pigmentation the shades money together
it's just not a good palette this
Coastal Scents palette I'm also going to
keep he's got some bright fun colors and
they don't reach for it much mmm okay
I'm gonna shut up I'm gonna pass this
along I'm never gonna reach for this I
know I'm never gonna reach for it even
though it's a nice collection of
eyeshadows I'm never gonna reach for it
I'm passing it along these here these
are the hard candy natural eyes smokey
eyes and sassy eyes I never reach for
these these two are not good this one is
pretty good but I don't reach for it so
I'm going to pass along to someone that
may reach for it this is another one you
know what I am going to keep this one
because this really is a good palette
this is the hard candy birthday soup
palette and it's all mattes
it's a really nice palette I don't reach
for it enough I think
the reason why I don't reach for it is
because it's so cluttered and all of the
rest of this so I'm going to actually go
in I'm not going to a little bit of that
I am going to keep this one along those
lines this one is the hard candy rated X
palette this one I don't reach for I'm
never going to reach for it I'm gonna
get rid of more let's see I just got
this this is the makeup revolution
salvation palette this is the girls on
film I just bought this I love it it's
wonderful pigmentation is fantastic I'm
going to keep that definitely for Laurie
outlet palettes I am going to keep the
blue palette one and I'm going to pass
along Milla palette 2 this one is not
shades that I typically reach for even
though it is a good palette and has very
nice lasting power but it's just not
about that I have a reach for this one
on the other hand does have shades that
I will reach for so I am gonna keep that
in wild comfort zone this is staying I
love this palette it is a must-have for
me a must-have for so many people that I
know if you don't own this palette I
definitely recommend you pick it up it's
just one of those iconic awesome
drugstore palettes and I feel like
everybody of every skin tone should own
it's 5 bucks it's amazing these two here
were limited edition wet-and-wild
palettes I am gonna pass along that
going into the wild I never reach for
this even though it's a really really
nice palette
I never reach for it I am gonna keep the
nude awakening there are some shades in
here that I do reach for occasionally
it's really really high-quality it's
wonderful I'm gonna keep that this here
was a really funny palette I got this in
a beauty box 5 and it's just a goofy
goofy palette it's getting stuck I don't
even know what to do with this one I
think I'm gonna give this to Lila my
daughter to play with and this will be
my gift to her I'm never gonna use this
even though these eyeshadows actually
are pretty good I'm never gonna use it
so I'm gonna pass it along to light up
the H Cosmetics galaxy chic palettes I
really really like this the
blendabilities shadows is wonderful
lasting power is wonderful it's just
it's you have to use other palettes with
it in order for it to work well because
you know it doesn't have any transition
College doesn't have any matte shades so
it's deadly a supplemental palette but
really really fun to work with
pigmentation is great and again if you
want to see swatches along these just go
to that chat and you'll be able to see
swatches of a lot of these palettes
all right Milani I just bought this
recently it doesn't work well for me
lasting power is not good I'm gonna pass
it along this one is called the
must-have neutrals the Carli bybel
palette I love this for me in cosmetics
it's a wonderful wonderful palette shade
range is kind of thin but the quality is
wonderful and I am going to keep that
now we're down to the elf I've saved
these for last because these are really
hard for me to declutter this is I have
an emotional attachment to these
palettes for some reason I don't know
why this is the elf mad format palette
this is a wonderful palette the lasting
power isn't fantastic but it really is
fun to use I'm going to keep that one
then knead it nude is also a wonderful
palette these are $10 eyeshadow palettes
really really like that as well I'm
going to keep that one these two I'm
going to get rid of this is the party
ready by elf this one is not something
that I will use and it's it's the
pigmentation is hit or miss it's just
not something I'll reach for and then
the everyday smokey is probably the the
worst quality of all of them and it's
just not something that I will reach
where I have smoky palettes that I like
better I'll have my revealed smoky
palette I also have my orbiting a smoky
palette I will never use this so this is
going to go away these are the 17
palettes that I am keeping which seems
kind of ridiculous to keep 17 palettes
but I truly love them and I really feel
like I'm going to use these palettes
here and they're on and off through the
next year or two so these are the ones
that I'm right and these are the 18
palettes that I am decluttering so I
feel like I did pretty well getting rid
of half of my drugstore palette
collection passing along to people that
I think will use them more I'm seeing a
trend here looking down at these that
there are a lot of look at these here 1
2 3 4 5 these here all look very similar
and then you look at this one
I mean they're all they're all kind of
similar in tone you know like I don't
know what's up with that I don't need
all of these I don't need all of these
they're all going away just somewhat to
a better home where people can use them
I'll probably bring them in to work and
see if anybody wants them oh this one's
side down but yeah so I'm excited to let
these go out of my collection and you
know I don't ever say I'm get letting
them go in order to buy more but if I
happen to buy more they'll be room for
the thank you so much for watching this
