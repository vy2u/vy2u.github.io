kind of situation so we'll see if this
this think an optical lose on my face
hello my friends welcome to my not
made-up face
I only wanted to try this derma silk
flawless the optical erase the
appearance of wrinkles in seconds
immediate airbrushed look craziness I
don't tend to buy into stuff like this
like erasing wrinkles in seconds are
serious are you serious so we're gonna
test it out and see what it works I can
tell you that I'm extremely skeptical
extremely skeptical I got this with my
Ipsy points thanks to people subscribing
using my Ipsy link so we all get to
benefit from this product that I got and
I want to see why there works because if
it does then it's a miracle it's it's
directions for best results apply a thin
layer to skin when using without makeup
apply as the last step in your regimen
so my morning skincare routine consists
of a toner and daily exfoliator and a
moisturizer the toner and the daily
exfoliator are from polished choice and
the moisturizer is from from Clinique so
this is going to be the fourth product
that I put on my face and I'm gonna get
you up close and personal so you can see
what we're working with here alright so
let's take a look at my face so the
biggest problem that I hate is these
wrinkles up here now since I've been
using polished choice they've definitely
become less prominent but they're still
there so I've got those and then I've
got some fine lines under my eyes my
eyebrows are not done and that's not
what this video is about so we're good
I've got some fine lines around my eyes
here I've got a little bit of fine lines
in between my eyes right there and see
anything else the big thing is these
guys up here these big wrinkles I call
those wrinkles some people might call
them fine lines I call them wrinkles so
those are the areas that we're targeting
are the fine lines under the eyes and
then the wrinkles on the forehead oh I
just lifted up on my phone this product
cost $24.99 and it says Dharma soap
flawless was developed with advanced
optics technology that visibly makes the
skin appear years younger
it says you were obstacle
erase the appearance of wrinkles and
have an airbrushed model like look
through skin firming technology the
appearance of wrinkles lines crow's feet
crow's feet uneven skin tone sagginess
and enlarged pores diminished and I
don't have enlarged pores so we're not
gonna be able to test that today we're
just gonna test the wrinkles derma sole
flawless is not skincare it is quite
quite simply tomorrow's innovative
technology today it is not a cream it is
a suspension of millions of particles
that reflect light perfectly in billions
of directions to make the skin surface
appear virtually flawless so basically
it's not something that is going to make
wrinkles actually disappear it's like an
optical illusion thing within seconds
pores disappear appear to disappear into
vanish
fine lines will appear to vanish so when
you get skincare a lot of times it'll
say you know use for a certain amount of
time in order to get it to work this one
is saying that it's not that kind of
thing that it's more of an optical
illusion kind of situation so we'll see
if this this think an optical lose on my
face
no there's no other directions for how
to apply it so I'm assuming I'm just
gonna apply it y'all ready for this then
a friend brown brown
okay so rubbing it into the skin it
doesn't say to rub or to pat it just
says put it on so it says in seconds so
do I look dramatically younger that's
the question in seconds it doesn't say
how many seconds it just says seconds
immediate so let's say you look at
myself oh no I think I look the same all
right let's do it feels a little tacky
on the skin by the way it feels a little
tightening a little bit it's kind of
weird but I don't think it's a
tightening as in that it's firming my
skin I think it's a tight like when you
have a product drying on your face how
it feels a little tight sometimes maybe
you guys close up can see but I don't
see anything right now so I'm gonna do a
little bit of padding just to make sure
that that's not the issue here and I'm
just look at this I'm squeezing it it is
a point seven-five fluid ounce but it's
like did I already use that much that
it's already almost empty in fact I use
that much it's so weird
okay a little bit more and we're gonna
Pat it into the skin this time let's
really focus on those forehead wrinkles
and the fine lines under the eyes
give me a little here okay
let it dry
oh now I think I look the same but I
don't think it works I don't see I don't
get it I don't get why it would work
especially $25 $25 hmm a lot of faith in
something but I don't see anything go do
you am I missing something here all
right um well another thing we could do
is it says you can apply after using
foundation when using a liquid
foundation apply after foundation so
maybe we could do that do you guys want
to do that I think that if you were here
you would tell me yes you want to do
that so let's apply a little foundation
and see what happens
all right I've been playing with this
elf what is it moisture foundation stick
ever since I bought it because Emily
Noel 83 recommended it and I really like
it so let's go ahead and apply that
when applying with liquid foundation
apply after foundation so this I would
consider a liquid foundation even though
it's a stick it's kind of liquidy it's
not a powder so there's two different
choices either liquid or powder so let's
just put a little bit more on and I'm
just very disappointed with the fact
that this thing looks like it's already
three quarters of the way empty oh no
about that alright so we're gonna go
ahead and do the whole padding on thing
again
okay and it definitely doesn't feel
silicone me a lot of like wrinkle
fillers and things feel silicone II this
one does not it's more lotion II and
then it feels tacky and then it dries
down and I don't feel it anymore I don't
know maybe a tiny bit not really well
this is a big want wall I was hoping to
find my miracle inner tube and I don't
think that I've found it this time so as
you can see this is gonna be a big fail
unfortunately I'm very sad that it
didn't work that it didn't erase the
appearance of wrinkles and seconds but I
feel like as a consumer you kind of have
to when you see something like this
really look up reviews before you invest
it I mean I to me this is crazy like
maybe I just used too much but I feel
like if I paid $25 for this I would be
really upset right now like really upset
and I'm sad that it didn't work but I'm
happy to be able to tell you that it
didn't work so thank you to those of you
who signed up using my Ipsy link because
now I can warn you about a product that
doesn't work I'm sure that wasn't derma
silks intention by giving this to me for
my Ipsy points but make a product that
works and I'll tell people it works so
that's my note to you and if you feel
like you have any suggestions if this
worked for you and you have any
suggestions for how I should use it then
yeah I definitely leave those in the
comments below I'm not perfect this is
the first time I'm using it so maybe I'm
doing something wrong but to me I feel
like it should be in the directions if
there's some other way that I'm supposed
to be applying this it should be in the
directions I know I look very weird cuz
I only have foundation on but we're
gonna end the video now cuz I'm gonna go
ahead and get ready for the next video
