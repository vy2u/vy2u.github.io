either love them or you hate them for me
personally all I care about is whether
it's good or not so let's dig into that
right now my friends today we are gonna
be digging deep and I'm gonna be telling
you everything you need to know about
the Dominique Cosmetics latte palette
this brand was created by christened
Dominique who is and a Instagrammer a
youtuber a person on the internet an
influencer who has created her own
makeup line she actually just recently
announced that she's coming out with a
second palette called the lemonade
palette it looks super super cute from
the outer packaging I personally have
not seen the inside of it yet but today
we're gonna be talking about her first
launch which is the latte palette there
are skip ahead buttons down below if
you've never been to one of my review
videos before they are quite long so
feel free to use those skip ahead
buttons to get to the parts that you are
really interested in don't go in those
comments and tell me that I'm wasting
your time with a long video and make it
easy for you if you want to skip feel
free but I will tell you according to my
analytics the majority of my viewers do
watch almost the entire video of my
videos because they're stinking awesome
so let's go ahead and get into that info
as you can see I have no makeup on
because today we're gonna be doing the
very first look from this palette that's
coming up skipping ahead down below if
you'd like to go straight to that so
first thing I know people are curious
about is if this is cruelty free they do
have the PETA Bunny on the back of the
product and it is made in the United
States a lot of the less expensive
eyeshadow palettes that are coming out
recently are made in China this one is
made in the United States it is 42 US
dollars my shipping cost for this is six
dollars and ninety cents leading to a
total of 48 dollars and 90 cents for
this palette there are ten eyes shadows
in this palette they are 1.8 Grammys
each according to the back of the
palette which is a decent size for an
eyeshadow I really like to see over a
gram there are brands like all Nastasia
and lorac they give less than
gram per shadow this is 1.8 so almost
two full grams if you don't count the
shipping the cost on this is two dollars
and 33 cents per gram if you do count
the shipping it's two dollars and
seventy two cents per gram either way it
is a good value compared to a sephora
priced brands such as Too Faced it is
less expensive than the typical Urban
Decay palette so in my opinion Kristin
dominique is not trying to run away with
your money without giving you enough
product but of course that only matters
if you plan on hitting pan on this
product what's really gonna matter I
think to the majority of people is the
quality of the shadows which we're going
to get into let's talk about what
Kristin Dominique says about this
palette it includes five warm tone
neutral shades the latte palette is
designed to work for all skin tones eye
colors and makeup artistry skills
there's ten color shadows five warm-up
tone neutrals which is kind of an
interesting way to word that to fun pops
of color and three foils for any day to
night look there's five transitional
colors that can be used all over the lid
or worked into the crease three gorgeous
foiled shimmer shades that can be used
all over the eye and the inner corners
or as a halo and two pops of color that
can make any eye color stand out there
said she says they're super blendable
you can create soft looks buildable to
an intense payoff that is long-lasting
and luxurious you get a beautiful mirror
in here I really love the packaging here
as far as the design I think it looks
clean it looks very luxe as far as the
design of it it's very pretty the
packaging however is cardboard so you're
not getting like a luxe packaging like a
Pat McGrath packaging but you're not
paying nearly as much as you would for a
Pat McGrath eyeshadow palette you I
expect cardboard packaging at this price
point but it does look really pretty I
love the colors that she used and it
just looks very sleek and clean to me I
also love that she's got the DC
imprinted in each shadow I think it just
takes it that extra level of pretty the
eyeshadows are named after coffee type
things things
hazelnut caramel vanilla cream mocha
pumpkin spice espresso macchiato creme
brulee cold brew and double shot now
let's go ahead and get a little bit into
the ingredie
as far as what you need to be aware of
put my glasses on so I can see a little
bit better so this is a talc based
product so if you are allergic to talk
if you're sensitive to tell you
definitely want to stay away from this
it mica is listed but it's not listed
until the may contain section I would
not count on this to be lip safe because
they do list ultramarines in here as an
ingredient which is not a lip safe
ingredient and then carmine is in here
so this is not a vegan product carmine
is made from crushed bugs they boil them
and they squeeze the juice out of them
and that's how you get the red pigment
carmine
so yeah if you're vegan that earth that
just grosses you out then you don't want
to use this you can always contact
dominique cosmetics I'm sure that they
would be able to tell you which shades
use carmine and which don't if that
matters to you carmine is used in many
many many many many makeup products many
eyeshadow palettes many lip products so
it's not an area of concern and les that
grosses you out but you may want to go
through your collection because
Carmine's in a lot of stuff I mean
really looking at the ingredient deck
it's a very typical eyeshadow ingredient
deck just it's just mixed in different
order than what I have seen in other
shadow palettes but the the eyeshadow
ingredients are not shocking there's no
parabens in here they do have
phenoxyethanol as the preservative in
here there is no bismuth oxychloride in
here that's an ingredient that has been
brought to my attention recently that is
irritating to people with sensitive skin
it's because of the micro crystalline
structure of the molecule or whatever it
can irritate the skin so that is not in
this palette so what I decided to do is
we're gonna do something a little bit
differently because I feel like it would
be valuable to you we're gonna do three
different looks for this video the first
one is going to be a more wearable more
natural look the second one is going to
be a little more creative a little more
wild a little more color and the third
look is going to be a dupe look so we're
gonna do hopefully as much drugstore
product as I can find and see how the
dominique cosmetics latte palette
measures up against i shadow z' of other
brands and I'm really excited about that
I haven't quite found the dupes yet so
I'm just kind of hoping they're to find
the dupes
I think I'm gonna be able to find dupes
in my collection for this palette so
we'll dip it up for look three but let's
go ahead and zoom in and get started on
look one which is going to be the more
natural wearable look so I figured since
the doing someone's eyeshadow tutorial
video is so popular right now and
because Kristin Dominic provided
tutorials on her website and on her
channel for this palette I figured we
would just follow one of those and see
if I can get my eye look to look like
hers is a gorgeous gorgeous look so
we're gonna go ahead and try it
for look number one I always like to use
the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
because this has been the most reliable
eyeshadow primer for me personally and I
will switch it up for looks two and
three the first step is to apply vanilla
cream all over the lid all the way up to
the brow bone now I don't know if this
would work as far as the application for
someone with a deeper skin tone she is a
more of a medium skin tone than I am so
I but I do think this is going to work
for me we will see the next thing that
she does is she uses this caramel shade
and she puts that up into her crease
have to say there's very little fallout
coming from the shadow I just kind of
dug my brush and I spun it in there and
there's just a little bit of kickback
but not a lot I'm gonna switch to a
little bit more of a detailed brush
because she says to keep the shade
pumpkin-spice from the center to the
corner of the brow so let's I actually
haven't used this shadow yet I've worn
this palette I think three or four times
but I haven't used pumpkin spice yet so
I'm excited to use it I have to say
they're blending really nicely and now
she's blending but she doesn't want to
go to the inner corner so let's do that
this is where I kind of wish that she
had zoomed in and gone a little bit
slower maybe it's just my skill level
but she's using hazelnut and she's using
it for the outer V so we're gonna try it
and see how it goes
she's using a bigger brush I would I
would think to use a smaller brush for
this but I'm trusting that she knows
better than I do
okay she's bringing it out I should have
just gone with my gut and used a smaller
brush and she's blending let us blend my
brush she's her so dirty this one's
gross looking
I don't have a brush like the one that
she's using cause I don't have hardly
any morphe brushes we're gonna go into
mocha and swirl this in the outer corner
she's just kind of going in a circle I'm
making the eyeshadow application face
she's going a little more up in the
crease than I did so let's go up a
little more now she's talking she's
blending so let us blend this is why my
eyeshadow looks don't come out as good
as some of these pros I don't usually
spend this much time blending cuz I feel
like it's gonna muddy them all together
but it's not I have got like some
weirdness happening over here but I'm
assuming I'm gonna be covering that up
but they definitely don't match
completely on both sides a little bit
more of that Brown right there I don't
know this woman is still blending like
ten minutes later she's still bleeding
I'm convinced that this is why my eye
looks never turn out great is because I
blend for like two seconds
I think she's putting on more product
but she's not explaining that come on
Kristin give me more give me more
all right I'm gonna pack just a little
bit more right there because she's
really dark right there now she just
said that there's an ingredient in here
that's made from crushed pearls I'm
gonna have to look at the ingredient
list and try to figure out what the
world that is hey it looks like she's
working this in the inner corner with a
brush now I would normally apply this
with my fingertips because I personally
prefer that I feel like it comes out
more pigmented with shadows that are
shimmery and foiled but she's using a
brush so I'm gonna use a brush how we
lookin so far okay I bring it down to
the inner corner all right Kristin let's
do it
she says a winged liner brush I couldn't
really see what she was talking about
but it kind of looks like an angled
liner brush so we're gonna go ahead and
do that she sprays it with some fix+ and
then I don't know I can't find my fixed
gloss so we're just gonna use the Make
Up For Ever mist and fix and then she
uses a macchiato as a liner a mocha
mocha not macchiato mocha as a winged
liner
I honestly don't think this is gonna be
intense enough to get past this I think
it's just gonna blend in maybe I just
need more of this or maybe the fix+ is
just better I don't know I've really got
it wet now okay I think my brush just
wasn't wet enough
now I've setting spray on my mirror
fabulous because I did do this a little
bit differently than I normally do
normally I will put the product on my
brush and then spray it but because she
sprayed her brush first
I trust it in that I do have a little
bit of darkening of the product there so
I'm hoping I didn't just create hardpan
and damage my product there I will let
you know because I'm just going to the
grocery store today and pick out my kids
from the bus stop things like that we're
not gonna do a full face but I am gonna
put on lashes and she put on lashes but
we're gonna do like some more natural
lashes this is the house of lashes lash
glue that I picked up when I was
recently in New York City ever he's NYC
oh my gosh this is the most amazing lash
glue of all time I asked the women who
worked there you know what's the deal
with it cuz I needed some lash glue and
they were like yeah it's the best and I
completely agree and I'm so glad that I
got it looks a little odd without
mascara on this isn't my normal routine
normally I would put mascara on a liner
liner and then mascara and then lashes
so we were going in a different order
today we're trying something new
now looking at her closely it looks like
somehow she has mascara on I must have
missed that step or she just has really
dark lashes so I'm just gonna go ahead
and apply a little bit of mascara to try
to blend this in a little bit so she is
baking under her eyes I do not do that
because I feel like it brings out the
creases underneath my eye so we're gonna
skip that and we're just gonna go
straight into the eye shadow
she used a caramel and she just kind of
fluffed it under her lash line I do have
a little bit of fallout so if I did do
that whole baking with the powder and
then fluffing it off thing I probably
wouldn't have that I can kind of see how
she's putting it on oh that is really
pretty
that is really really pretty and she's
just blending just a little bit more and
she very quickly applies some mascara to
the lower lash line her eye look looks
almost black I don't know what's
happening there mine doesn't look as
black as hers but mmm well just keep
going okay she's bronzing with the shade
now I don't have any foundation or
anything on but you know what what the
heck oh gosh I don't like that no no
Brown forehead no okay abort mission
we're not gonna do the brown forehead no
we will use a little blush though we'll
do it a little bit here I don't think I
would pick this as a blush I don't think
she's using it as a blush but you know
we figure we'll try it right she says to
use this for multi-purpose so let's go
into the brows with mocha hopefully it's
dark enough we'll see
hmm it's a little bit light but we're
gonna be a we're gonna make it work I'm
just gonna spray a little bit of mist
and fix on here and see if I can deep
and up mocha a little bit for like the
center to the outside of my brows and
that is working cool man
so let's go ahead and zoom in on how the
look looks right now definitely not as
beautiful as Kristin made it but this is
where we're at and we are in reality
right now and the reality is this is as
good as it gets
I did not have a time to start this
until later because I was doing other
stuff for videos but it is currently 219
in the afternoon so we'll be back
tonight to see how this war and yeah and
then that'll be the end of day one so we
will be back tonight to see how this eye
look is and compare it to how it looks
right now so will be about eight hours
see in a second it has been eight hours
since I put on my makeup did you see it
yep
and actually it looks really good I will
tell you before i zoom in that I think
my eyelashes are having performance
anxiety because I swear this is like the
best lash glue I have ever used and it
is so letting me down right now but I
don't want to give you a false
impression so I'm just gonna show you
what it looks like with my lashes
falling off and then I'm just gonna take
my lashes off so you can see without the
lashes on of course the day that I film
is the day that my lash glue isn't
working away I want them to so let me
just pull these off real quick so you
can see the look but definitely keep in
mind with wherever the lash glue was
that probably pulled the shadow off so
that's not the shadows fault let me show
you I mean as you can see it really does
still look pretty good for eight hours I
do feel like the macchiato shade has
faded a little bit it's been eight hours
so I would expect it to fade some but
overall I feel like the eye look looks
pretty good we do have a little bit of
transferring of the shimmer but again
I'm not hating on that I feel like this
is a decent wear time I don't have any
weird like massive amounts of fallout I
do
have some fallout some glitter but it's
not bad so that makes me happy
I don't know what is happening over here
it will just scrape that off I don't
know what that was the lower lash line
still looks pretty decent considering
this has been on all day
okay so day 1 has been completed it was
successful other than the unrelated
issue of my lash glue we're gonna go
ahead and move on to day 2 oh I forgot
to tell you I did put on this necklace I
just got this off of a whole look and I
was too excited and I had to wear it
it's my new Gemini necklace and I love
it
but anyway see you tomorrow in two
seconds tomorrow right now alright -
welcome to day two of the dominique
cosmetics olate palettes I have a baby
shower today but I also need to film so
the people at the baby shower just gonna
have to deal with my crazy eyes so I
decided to change the concept a little
bit yesterday I told you that we were
gonna do like a wearable look and then a
more bold look and then a dupe look well
I'm gonna change the way that that is
I'm gonna do one look that is within my
comfort zone which is the one that you
saw yesterday and now I'm gonna do one
that is out of my comfort zone I really
feel like I need to stretch my skills
today is out of my comfort zone I'm
gonna do a halo eye and halo eyes is
something that I have struggled with for
a long time and you can feel free to
leave your suggestions down in the
comments and constructive criticism in a
good way not in a mean way but I I'm
always up for learning more I'm not a
makeup artist but I do enjoy having fun
with makeup and I want to stretch my my
skills a little bit and we're gonna do a
full face because I got places to go
where I actually have to like have a
full face on today so I guess we should
just go ahead and get started I'm a
little bit nervous I have to tell you
let's go ahead and get into it we're
getting into it right now let me zoom in
I'm going see there's only one baby I'll
keep on punching myself back until now
cuz I need
I need all
the guy was robbing within the way he's
getting dressing baby I'm scooping
trouble but I was
I need
you
the killer she wants
it's not
before
doesn't he
I need
using
you
it's off
you are the car I know that you see it
so the effect you have on me I know you
still feel it
the costume to tell me this isn't true
you and I were meant to be I never do
more to you
I know just watching he come back come
back
I need
for sure
there's no
oh yeah it was the feeling and I know we
fell sorry I hope you can when they see
how much you meant to me and how I loved
you so
until now
that's you
all right so this is the final look
we're probably like I'm crazy of this
baby shower I really I had all
intentions of putting on fake lashes but
I just can't do it nobody's gonna be
there in full glam and I just I can't
pull the trigger on the lashes I just
can't do it so we're gonna just go with
bag L bang and just alright so it is
currently 929 in the morning it is
perfect timing for us to get going I've
got a two hour drive ahead of us and
then a few hours at the party and then
two hours drive back I will be back to
check in on this look when we get back I
since it's so early when I'd be able to
D to check in so yeah wish me luck
I'll see you in a little bit never mind
change my mind and we just went
downstairs and I looked at the footage
and I looked at the way I look for that
lashes and I was like no lashes need to
happen it is what it is they're family
if they don't accept me for this then oh
well that's just a way that it is so
yeah let me go ahead and zoom in the
eyes with lashes you just so you can say
these are Koko lashes and if I can
figure out what style they are I will
put them down below this is like the
fourth time I've worn them so the box is
like long gone
I found out these from Robbie to
Christie and they're amazing and then I
tried the House of lashes lash glue that
seems to be working better today than it
did yesterday so yeah so we will see how
this lust that's it I'm done seeing a
bit hello my friend I'm back this is for
me it's been about eight hours a lot of
sitting in the car and then sitting at
the baby shower and then sitting on the
way home and now I'm gonna sit and edit
but before I go do that I wanted to show
you the eight-hour check-in on the eyes
so you can see how it looks cuz this I
feel is like a typical work / school day
so let's go ahead sumit it so for me the
big things that I see is that the green
has faded some up into the crease and
there's some transferring of that
shimmer shade what's that thing called
that was called creme brulee I feel like
I could still look at myself and go okay
I can do something with this I like I'm
still cool with it like I'm not hating
on it and it's been eight hours so what
we're gonna do is now we're gonna see if
we can take this into the evening and I
will check back with you after my kids
go to bed it's 5:30 and about five more
hours we'll come back and check in so
let's close eyes one more time and yeah
we'll see you in five hours it has been
a very long day it has been thirteen
hours since I've put this eyeshadow on
and actually it doesn't look horrible
usually by thirteen hours with a
mediocre eyeshadow palette the you can't
even see the original I look it's just
all mushed together right now you can
still see the original eye look it's
definitely significantly faded but let
me let me just zoom en I'll show you
okay so let me go ahead and close my
eyes so you can see I mean 13 hours I
just don't expect it to look good
anymore but have I had I shadow palettes
that still look good at 13 hours yes I
have for example coloured raine
eyeshadow palettes the Too Faced
chocolate bold palette for some reason
still looks really good at 13 hours this
one is definitely faded yeah my just
closed for you one more time I don't
know about you but I am excited for
tomorrow's dupe look I had some good
stuff from the drugstore they were going
to be duping with this pellet super
excited hang tight it's coming right now
alright we are back finally for the last
look in the Dominique Cosmetics lot a
pilot review oh my goodness so I didn't
realize it was going to be a while
before I came back to try this palette
one more time for you I got stuck in
halo Beauty land but now we are back and
we're gonna try this one more time so
today is the dupe palette look so I have
got my dominate cosmetics laisse palette
and we are going to use products out of
the perfusion eyeshadow palettes I had
to dip into two of them this is the
perfusion sultry palette we're gonna
take some shades from here we're also
going to take some shades from the
perfusion amber eyes palette which is
right here so that is going to be on one
eye and the Dominique Cosmetics palette
is going to be on the other
now these do not do out perfectly
perfectly especially with the dominique
cosmetics the the more colorful ones the
cold brew and double shot there is a
green and a purple kind of like this but
they are not matte they are shimmer
shades you can kind of see them here
this shade right here at Lagoon is kind
of sort of kind of close and bewitched
is not really close at all
bewitched is much darker than the one in
the Dominique Cosmetics palette but if
you wanted to do something purpley you
could probably pull it off with that but
some of the other shades are really
really close let me just show you those
real quick
and I'm just gonna put them on my
fingers next to each other these are not
exact dupes I'm just letting you know
right now they're not exactly but you
could get very similar looks okay so we
have hazelnuts and then the shade zing
and that's those two right there so this
is hazelnut this is zing switching over
to the other one and we've got caramel
and outgoing and that's those right
there ideal is actually in both of these
palettes and it actually isn't even
close to being a dupe but it's the
closest thing that I can get in these
two pallets and I don't want to go over
to another brand I want to stick with
the same brand so this is vanilla cream
and this is ideal hey now we're moving
on to mocha and cozy these aren't great
dupes but they'll serve the same purpose
the pointer fingers pumpkin spice and
then the ring finger is fearless moving
down to these shimmery guys down here we
have espresso and there's no shimmers
well the shimmers in here are not not
shimmery enough they're not even close
to what we've got in the dominique
cosmetics pout so we're going to switch
back over to the sultry palette and
we're gonna go to the shade caring which
is this guy over here okay next up
macchiato and the shade awake which is
this guy over here
and creme brulee and three wishes okay
now these of course are the ones that I
said they're not dupes but you might be
able to use them for a similar purpose
but it's the closest we're gonna get her
tonight so we're gonna do cold brew and
Lagoon
and then these are definitely not dupes
but it's closest I got double shot and
bewitched say not even close to paying
tips we could do the other one I can
show you nimble to me
wait off bewitched and we'll do nimble
instead which is the ones a little
closer to a mat but it's still way
darker and there is anything close in
the other palette so that's really the
only one that there's you just can't do
put these palettes so we won't be using
that one today I think we should do one
without the bright colors and kind of
focus on these guys over here cuz I feel
like that's where the stronger dupes are
and I'm just gonna do a typical cat I am
NOT gonna do anything fancy or magical
and it's gonna be another one of those
music ones so we can get this party roll
in here so we're gonna use the Ulta eye
primer in nude matte for this I hate the
word nude for a champagne II kind of
color drives me bonkers not everybody is
that color when they're new regardless
it's a very nice primer so we're gonna
use that I think it's about ten or
twelve bucks at Ulta
can I say no to where do you go when I
see a man I'm a little car
little shake
as someone
to make a mistake
you
see
oh it sounds fake
okay so just some initial first
impressions from putting those on next
to each other I've never used them
side-by-side before and just some first
impressions I do feel like the matte
shades from the profusion palette went
on more intense and more pigmented where
the Dominique Cosmetics one it was more
buildable now with the shimmer shades I
do feel like the dominique cosmetics one
packs a bigger punch it was kind of like
BAM on your face I also had a little bit
more fallout with the dominate cosmetics
one those those shadows are so
incredibly soft the texture is just so
much softer than the perfusion but I do
feel like I've got similar looks on both
eyes but I do feel like there's more
separation of color with the dominique
cosmetics one already just from you know
looking in the mirror you might be able
to tell with like a zoom in better than
I can but but I just feel like that the
dominique cosmetics one just looks more
punchy you know it's more in your face
where the perfusion one is a little more
muted so that being said let's go ahead
it is now 4:14 it is so incredibly late
if I can get my phone to stay on I was
working on the Tati halo Beauty vitamin
video I was trying to get that up today
and my kids had an early dismissal
because of ice we're about to get a big
huge snowstorm so I got started with
doing this video really really late
because I was working on editing and
uploading and makeup minute all that
early this morning so anyway enough
excuses we're gonna be back in eight
hours so that's what eight four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve after
midnight we all let it all hang now
sometimes even if you're not the best
singer you should just sing because it
brings joy to the heart didn't know what
I'm saying alright so yeah so we will be
back a little bit after midnight and see
how this eye shadow were through the day
I'm just staying in the house all day
I'm cooking dinner I was going to go out
to the grocery store but that is not
going to happen in misleading I see rain
nastiness so we'll be back after the Sun
Goes Down hopefully we can get some
comparable lighting I'll do my best I'm
gonna wait till the midnight hour when
my
shot of stars Devane oh no I left my
phone downstairs oh my gosh okay I left
my phone mount downstairs I'm tired I
can't even
it's about 12:45 in the morning so it
has been eight and a half hours since I
put this eye shadow look on and I just
looked at the footage of this eye look
this look was raw food look was
definitely not my favorite eye look I've
ever created I'll tell you that but
it'll serve the purpose the purpose of
this is not to create an impeccable eye
look and everybody's gonna go WOW the
purpose of this look is what we're doing
right now is deciding whether the
drugstore priced palette is the same
quality as the more expensive palettes
so let's take a look all right I'm gonna
close my eyes remember this side is the
perfusion this side is dominique
cosmetics so yeah I don't think there's
much of a comparison to be honest with
you this shimmer on the perfusion side
has significantly faded I mean you you
can't deny that there is a lot more
fallout on the dominique cosmetics side
but i think some of that is from the
initial application
I think the live that was there because
I forgot to wipe it off I honestly
forgot so just be careful make sure you
tap off your brush wipe off any excess
I'm sorry that I can't report on the
fallout through the day I do apologize
for that that's a fail on my part but
yeah I think dominique cosmetics
definitely beats profusion in this the
shadows initially were much more bold
and they've remained bold where the
profusion has faded and if you look and
see the colors have completely muddied
together on the profusion side where the
dominique cosmetics side is you know you
could still see separation of color even
up into the crease you can see that this
part is deeper then over here and yeah
it still looks pretty decent we do still
have that transferring of the foiled
shade up onto the brow bone though so
let's let's zoom out and kind of just
talk about what's happened in these
three wear tests because we need to
touch on that that part
that needs to be touched on but I have a
solution for you hang tight hold on me
to zoom you out hello editing Jen here
so yeah I guess so into these we're
tests that I completely forgot that I
didn't introduce swatches of course we
have to do some swatches oh my goodness
so let's go ahead and get into those
right now and then we'll go into my
final thoughts about the Dominique
Cosmetics latte palette we're gonna go
ahead and start off with the first four
shades
this is hazelnut caramel vanilla creme
or vanilla cream and mocha and as you
can see they're not swatching very well
like I mentioned they are buildable so I
decided with these four in particular I
was gonna do a double swatch just so you
could really see them on my arm but you
could see that that one that mocha one
was definitely really patchy till the
second swatch that's part of that
buildable mists of these shadows now
here are the brush swatches and as you
can see hazelnut and caramel really
breast swatch absolutely beautifully and
then vanilla cream is actually a really
nice brush swatch for a shade that's
that light sometimes those brush swatch
really really badly mocha
again very very patchy in the brush
swatch but again it's one of those it's
going to be buildable on the eye and it
does build up and hopefully you saw that
in the different demos so if you knew
the channel you're new to the wipe test
and some people believe in it some
people don't
I very strongly believe in the wipe test
and what this shows is it shows which
shadows are going to stain the skin not
staying for a long time but stain so it
gives you an idea of the wear time of
the shadows throughout the day now of
course you're not rubbing your eyes left
hand through the day that wouldn't make
any sense but through the day through
wind and just reading your eyes blinking
in all of that the shadows do wear down
and I find this to be very accurate so
we look at the wipe test you can see
that hazelnut and caramel and mocha
definitely are still there where vanilla
cream is pretty much completely gone
which is typical for a shade like this
and I found all
this to be very true on the eyes as well
moving on to the next four we are going
in to pumpkin spice espresso macchiato
and a creme brulee these foils really
are absolutely beautiful and the pumpkin
spice actually reminds me a lot of an
Anasazi of Beverly Hills matte shadow
it's very very nice and you can see that
even the foiled shades swatch very well
with a brush when I saw Kristin
Dominique using a brush for the foils I
was very surprised because typically
they're applied with a finger tip when
you have a formula like this but they do
apply very well with a brush that's
great news for people with long
fingernails people with especially oily
skin on their fingers you don't have to
worry about putting your fingers into
the shadows you can definitely use a
brush and still get an absolutely
gorgeous look and see the beautiful
shimmer and shine on those foiled
shadows and that pumpkin spice is just
so opaque both in the finger swatch and
the brush swatch and as you wipe them
away you can see that they all hang out
there really well macchiato is the AH
one that fades the most and finally the
last two the fun to cold brew and double
shot I did have to do a little bit of
extra color correcting here that's why
it's got a little bit of a tinge of
green to it but I wanted to make sure
that these were as accurate as possible
to what they look like
in real life and this is very accurate
to what they look like in real life
brush watch again a little bit patchy on
cold-brew and double shot both but again
they're both very buildable so I am not
hating on the fact that they are just a
tad bit patchy not as patchy as mocha
was but still a little bit patchy as we
weapon away you can just see how much
they stain the skin of course these do
come off very easily with eye makeup
remover but the lasting power on both of
these shadows is very very good so now
I've shown you the swatches let's get
back to the final thoughts on this
palette so kind of adding on what I was
just saying I think my biggest critique
of the Dominique Cosmetics palette is
the transfer of the foiled shadows onto
my brow bone and I think that that could
be solved just by using a glitter glue
NYX makes a fantastic one if you're
looking for one that's less expensive to
face makes a really good
there's there's plenty of options for
glitter glue I would definitely
recommend that for the foiled shadows
just these three over here down in the
bottom corner but other than that the
lasting powers fantastic blend ability
is really really good I love that
they're buildable I know that the
profusion went on more pigmented but I
kind of like shadows that are more
buildable and it seems to go along I
don't know much about Kristen Dominique
but it seems to go along with her
personal style that it's you know she
likes she seems to like to layer and
build up so it fits with her which I
really really like as far as the color
selection of the palette I feel like
it's it is quite ordinary there isn't a
whole lot special in it but these two
shades really do kind of bring some fun
to the palette and I'm really glad she
included them because it really opens up
the palette for a lot more choices which
i think is great I'm also glad she put a
lot of mattes in there because I know
there are a lot of people that
absolutely love matte shadows and she's
got a nice range of shades here from
light medium and deep to create some
some really nice and significant depth
on the eye the foiled shadows is another
critique that I have I wish that these
were a little more varied in color and
tone and choice maybe even a very deep
brown would have been nice in the
shimmer maybe doing one a colored foiled
shade would have been great I'm calling
him shimmers but they're technically I
think she calls them foiled but a one
that had was a little more fun like
these may be in a foiled formula would
have been fun a duochrome I'm always
begging please brands give me duo
Chrome's I love duo chrome that would
have been really really wonderful and
unique I feel like these are kind of
similar I don't know I just kind of you
know it's like whenever I pick this up I
feel like I could go with one or the
other and you know especially
interchanging these two it's like to
every to me I can tell the difference
but to everybody else they don't look
that much different if you know what I'm
saying so wish there was a little bit of
a different choice there I think this
was a really smart color choice for her
first palette I'm really looking forward
to the lemonade palette to see whether
she comes up with something a little
more creative a little bit more fun I'm
not hating on the fact that this is a
little more ordinary a little more
typical just because it is her first
palette so overall this is going to be a
recommend it's a great quality palette
and it was it's fun to you
I do enjoy using it and that's kind of a
gut feeling that I get when I use
certain eyeshadow palettes you know that
they they give me joy when I use them I
talk about that you know a palette gave
me joy
this one does give me some joy it's not
the the 10 level of joy it's like maybe
like a 7 level of joy but still it's
giving me joy and I'm very thankful to
have this palette and I think that she
did a great job well done
