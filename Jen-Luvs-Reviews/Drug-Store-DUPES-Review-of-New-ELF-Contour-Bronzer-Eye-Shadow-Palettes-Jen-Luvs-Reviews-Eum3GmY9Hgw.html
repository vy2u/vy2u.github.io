all of the brand new elf products that I
purchased recently I'm so excited to
share these with you because we've got
some good stuff my friend I'm not gonna
ramble anymore let's just get into it so
we're gonna go ahead and start off with
my least favourite products and then
move up to my favorites so my least
favorite products I have two the first
one we're gonna get out of the way in
the beginning and that is the elf mu
what is it called it came in this box
here and it is the god of glow lip tint
in perfect pink now this is one of those
color-changing lip product thingies I
did have it on earlier and it's come off
since then but I'm just gonna go ahead
and put it on for you now so you can see
the color so that is how it looks when
it goes on you can see that it's got
this light pink tinge to it but then
when you put it on at change it's
supposed to change to your body heat now
when it goes on it feels quite
moisturizing it doesn't have any scent
to it that I can smell at all
my only problem with this is it does not
last very long as soon as you do
anything and the color is completely
gone
also it dried my lips out something
terrible like I wore it earlier and all
of a sudden I've got this huge crack in
my lip like it's just this was probably
the most drying lipstick I have ever
used now I have heard from other people
I did like a little mini review of this
on my wassup and makeup app and people
were saying that this did not dry their
lips out but you dried my lips out so
there's a chance it may may dry your
lips out too so I wanted to let you know
about that this is definitely a no for
me I will not be repurchasing this at
all this will actually probably after
this video no longer exists just because
I can't really pass it on to anybody and
I don't really want anybody else's lips
to be dried out so that was a no for me
the other product that is a note for me
is the bronzer palette this here is a
zipper on xur palette and my first
critique about this is there isn't much
of a shade range like I don't I don't
really get what they were thinking
create
I mean you can see it right away it's
like there just isn't much variation of
course they're all warm tone they're not
meant for contouring I do like that
there's this giant mirror here boyo I
like the giant mirror but I don't know
this one has some good sparkling this
one is a satin these two are maps but
I'll show you some swatches of them one
two three four just not impressive at
all I know I've got some old swatches I
was finding dupes for you guys for the
eyeshadow palettes so there's some weird
swatches going on but you can see this
one here that last one is the only one
that's really worth anything that one's
this one down here and I don't feel like
this is worth the six dollars just for
this one shade I don't feel like it
performs well enough as far as the one
with the sparkle in it you don't even
really see the sparkle if that's
something you're looking for so no I
would not recommend this one probably
gonna be passing this on to somebody I
don't know someone that's not used to
using bronzers and just wants a very
light light light bronzer so this is a
new alright so moving on to the good
stuff because pretty much everything
else is good stuff yeah let's just go
since we just hit the bronzer cut let's
talk about the contour palette next this
contour palette is pretty stinkin
awesome this is the way that it looks
now this is a personal pratik this is
this is the thing I don't like about it
but for other people it's not gonna make
a difference this highlighter here is
pretty much my skin tone like when I
swatch it on my hands it's like well my
hand is a little bit darker than my face
I think I don't know but anyway when I
try to let me just tell you application
wise when I try to apply this to my skin
it just blends right in like a powder it
does not do anything it does have a
yellow tint to it so if that does not
match your skin tone just be aware of
that but these three are awesome oh my
goodness they are fabulous fabulous
powders I am wearing this contour
palette today I don't know if you can
still see how to put my makeup on quite
a few hours ago but you can see that it
is still very much there very excited
about this
I will swatch it Eastwatch me for you
highlights bronzer contour girlfriend
white so you see this wait till you see
this
oh oh bam bam
BAM I was like what seriously and then I
got another what-what for you all right
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait this is a Smashbox contour
palette highlight it's coming it's
coming
bronzer contour highlight bronzer
contour okay they're not exact dupes
alright but they're pretty stinking
close this is my holy grail right now
contour palette okay
I've used the stink out of this thing
like I love this contour palette it's
close enough to a dupe for me that I
feel like I don't really even need this
anymore I feel like this one is just as
good and this is $6 and I will put the
price for the Smashbox one down blur I
don't know it off the top of my head but
I'm excited about you know I mean like I
said they're not exact well they're
pretty stinking close to dupes they're
pretty stinking close okay so let's go
ahead and move on to the eyeshadow
palettes now there are four of them and
I got all four first one and then I'm
gonna talk about this party ready
there's also mad format everyday smokey
and need a new boarder to start with my
least favorite which is the party ready
when you look at it initially it's kind
of like wow that thing's kind of crazy
right like but it's really not it's
really not the the shades are pretty
subtle believe it or not and I really
feel like this palette is best for
people that are just getting used to
color they're just kind of starting off
with color if you like a big huge pop of
color you're gonna think this is week
you're gonna straight-up think it's week
so if you just want to experiment with
color with you know some neutrals with
some smokiness I would definitely
recommend this palette the other thing I
want to mention bout this palette is the
lasting power is not fabulous by the end
of the day it's faded significantly so
just be aware of that let me go ahead
and go into a few dupes for you now I
don't have as many dupes for this
palette as I do for some of the other
ones but the first one I want to show
you is this third one here and I'm gonna
go ahead and always put the elf one is
always going to be first closest to my
knuckles so here is the elf one and you
can see how creamy that is and I'm only
going to do finger swatches but you know
this is because we're doing a dupe
purpose so just know that when you apply
them to the eyes that is slightly
different but anyway let me show you the
dupes so this one is the Stila in the
Garden palette and i'm gonna show you
honey and i apologize i just realized my
nail polishes chips but y'all be all
right you'll you'll survive of that
right sure there's honey so close this
one's a bit warmer but you're gonna get
a similar look with it and then here is
my lorac mega Pro that's very dirty
because they give it lots of love and
I'm going to show you copper and I think
copper is a closer dupe for the elf
palette here then honey is but I wanted
to show you those just because they're
pretty similar the only other one that I
have a dupe for in here is this pink one
here there's that and then that is a
dupe for Urban Decay's alchemy oh my
goodness the rain is really picking up
out there all right
the
the shade that I have is in the vice 3
palette I believe they sell it in a
single though and it looks it's right
here so there is alchemy so you'll see
there is a slight difference of course
it looks this one is definitely a more
pigmented like I said alchemy is gonna
stay on your eyes forever where the elf
one is gonna fade through the day ok so
here are all the shades I'm just gonna
hold those up here for you so you can
see what they look like I mean these are
not what you would expect for elf
shadows like I've bought out shadows
before and this is not typical for elf
shadows like this is this is pretty
awesome
my favorite shades in here are this
first one it's a frosty white with a
yellow tint to it and it's absolutely
gorgeous of course I love the copper
shade I really like this pink shade here
and this blue one here is beautiful it's
like a deep it's like a blackish with
some blue sparkle in it man it's raining
and it looks like it looks like that in
the pan and it's just like a midnight
blue with blue sparkles one thing I love
about this white color is that it shifts
from a white frosty white to a yellow
and it's just really cool I've never
quite seen a shade like that you
probably have because you probably know
more shades than I do
but I mean it's just absolutely gorgeous
the way that okay the next one that
we're gonna talk about is the mad for
matte palette now I'm not saying this is
a bad palette but this is pro this is my
next least favorite I would say that
this is my least most favorite let's go
for that one I do like this palette a
lot but if I were to recommend this one
this would not be on the top of my list
if the matte shades are very nice for
drugstore mattes I mean I've heard that
matte eyeshadows are very difficult to
make and I feel like for drugstore
mattes then this is a really really nice
palette let me go ahead and show you
some of the dupes that I found okay so
we're gonna start with this one
elf is always going to be by my knuckles
and we're gonna duke that with the lorac
pro 2 palette and we're gonna go into
light brown which is here
there you go so you can see there's a
tiny bit of a tone difference but I
don't think that there's going to be a
difference on the eye the fourth one
which is here next to there so that's
elf for nectar from lorac - you can
definitely feel butteriness in the lorac
that you don't feel with the elf and
again you can see a little bit of a
difference in the pigmentation that the
lorac is definitely has more opacity
than the elf so we're gonna go with this
one here and this one I found a dupe for
Urban Decay's tease so there is elf
seven matte seven and we're gonna break
into the Naked 2 palette tease them so
there you go so there's the elf from the
matte palette and then there's Urban
Decay's tease from Naked 2 so this one
is slightly slightly warmer but I think
they're pretty close I think on the eye
they're gonna look pretty similar so
that's all the dupes that I have for the
matte palette I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch the entire palette for you now
the entire palette switched and there is
that now as far as overall thoughts
about this palette I definitely am a
bigger fan of the shades from here down
these two shades are pretty weak and
powdery there it's a really really big
fight to get these two to show up
especially this one here which kind of
makes this it more difficult to use for
people with lighter skin people a deeper
ski and I think are gonna have an easier
time because you could probably find a
highlight shade somewhere else but I
like to use these kinds of shades on my
all over lid and that kind of leads me
leaves me without an all-over lid color
so yeah I'm people for lighter skin
people with darker skin are probably
gonna like this a little bit better this
one here the duke forties is also a
little bit chalky so just keep that in
mind so I mean it's a great palette no
is it a good palette and yes alright
let's go ahead and move on to the smoke
so here is the smoky palette and that is
what that looks like there I am really
excited about this palette if you are in
need of a smoky palette I would
definitely recommend this one this one
is a lot of fun
that's the one I'm wearing on my eyes
today just like the other two palettes
the lasting power is just kind of so-so
on this but it will last you through a
school day or a workday just fine it's
just extending it into the evening it
kind of fades a bit okay so let's go
ahead and do smoky - which is this one
here that rain is common down BAM okay
again powdery on the lighter shades be
aware okay but you can build this one up
a little bit so there's that and we are
going to put that with a low rocks buff
which is in this palette the to the pro
two and you'll see the difference in
pigmentation right away I mean you can
see the lorac is much more opaque but
they can serve the same purpose if you
want them to serve the same purpose now
this one feels very chalky and powdery
to swatch but then when you put on your
eye it just basically comes out with
mostly glitter you're gonna you're gonna
see mostly glitter you're not going to
get the opacity that you do with the
dupe but you can get it to work for you
this was the limited edition Kat Von D
spellbinding eye shadow put the book
that came out a couple years ago and
this has been one of my favorite
palettes of all time so this is precious
up here and I'll swatch that next to it
okay and you can see they're very very
very similar on someone with a deeper
skin tone you're really going to be able
to see the do penis-butt the elf
definitely has more sparkle in it I'd
have not experienced fallout with it
though which is very very surprising but
I do use a primer so if you don't use a
primer you may experience some fallout
with that elf shade okay next is gonna
be smoky v which is this one here so
there's the elf
now we're gonna break up the Kat Von D
interstellar palette which is relatively
new and we're going to do 3 a.m. which
is this one here
and the cap on d1 is just a tad bit
deeper but you can definitely use those
for the same purpose okay the next one
is this gray here we're gonna go ahead
and swatch that smoky eight I like to
call it which is there I mean it just
it's beautiful it works beautifully you
don't have the original lorac palette I
wish I did
be perfect for duping and there's lorac
star Cole and then the last one is
smokey ten which is the black and I just
wanted to compare that for you to the
black from the lorac so there's the elf
black and then here's the rocks black
there you go exciting right
and then also Darkthrone by Kat Von D
also out of here which is right here so
again I'll tell you the blacks again
this is the elf this is the lorac and
this is the Kat Von D mm-hmm I'm gonna
wipe these off and then I'm gonna swatch
the whole palette right so here is the
smoky palette swatched out for you and
then just some final thoughts my
favorite shades in here I love this
white it's almost got an iridescent to
it it's got that that shine that gives
you that illusion of iridescent it's a
beautiful inner corner highlights I
absolutely love this shake here I
absolutely love this shade here I really
like this shade a lot in this black is
just perfect it's perfect
I can't I cannot believe that this black
is a drugstore black I just I can't
believe it I'm in shock map Selene shock
and I mean I'm in shock for these two to
like are you kidding me like I'm I'm
just floored so I really love this
palette would highly recommend it if
you're looking for a smoky palette
highly highly highly highly highly
recommend absolutely all right let's
move on to my favorite which is the
needed nude palette I cannot wait to
show you this sorry this is the needed
nude palette I just I just am so excited
about this one okay that's what it looks
like okay I don't have the original
Naked palette I don't have the Naked 3
all they have is the Naked 2 so I can't
say as far as dupes for those but I am
gonna show you some dupes that I found I
found quite a few for this palette this
one
here is the first one and I'm gonna dupe
this with steel as Shenoy so there is
the elf and not as powdery as you would
expect for that light of a shade and
then Steelers shenoy is in here I know
right I know right okay moving on new to
which is here and I'm gonna dupe this
with steel as wheat I mean what what
that's drugstore once I am I am alright
oh can you tell excited I am
I hope hopefully you're as excited as I
am about this because I'm super excited
Newt three is right here and I'm gonna
dupe this with Kat Von D's Sunset
Boulevard there's that I mean how
gorgeous okay Sunset Boulevard is in
here just right here
flood warning flood warning dismiss
dismiss all right so this is Kat Von D's
Sunset Boulevard there you go
like I stuff swatches down here go away
swatches you're no longer welcome and
I'm gonna dupe this with steel as puppy
I couldn't find a do for steel as kitten
I was so so sad and then here's steel
this puppy and this pallet here by the
way this is the eyes are the window to
the spirit pallet I believe these are
still available this is kind of like
steel us best of pallet okay hopefully
you can see that look it's not coming
off as well as I would like it to here
is this one here and I'm gonna do that
it's not quite the same but it's close
Toula rocks Rose I mean look at that are
you kidding me drugstore okay here is
lyrics rose now looking at that I don't
feel like those are dupes
yeah the puppy I don't feel like puppies
are do any more now looking at it yeah I
disagree with myself now if you were
thinking that I'm now with you okay so
let's do this one and that that's low
rocks rose so this one's a little bit
more orange tone this one's a little
more peach tone but still still needs
six okay that one is very very similar
to the one in the party palette that
goes with low rocks copper and steel as
honey I know I know I know oh my god I'm
dying I'm dying okay we'll just do the
rocks copper okay
slight tone difference and then let's do
steel this honey
I feel like steel as honey is a bit
closer to this one to this than the
copper from lorac okay I could not find
a dupe for this one so I'll just swatch
it for you just for fun I know there's a
dupe out there I know there is I'm just
not sure what it is I don't own it but
it's like a brown with some gold sparkle
in it
nude 8 here there's that oh I don't have
a dupe for that one either so there you
go there's nude eight nude nine
this one is a dupe for Urban Decay's
busted which is a very famous shade I
wish there was a ydk dupe
I was looking for it I couldn't find it
I was done but here's busted and busted
just a tad bit deeper but very very
similar and then I couldn't dupe this
last one either exactly this deep brown
I'm sure there's got to be a dupe there
has to be because it's just a basic deep
brown so there you go there's all the
dupes I'm gonna go ahead and erase the
high-end one and then just show you this
palette on its own alright so those
right there are these this is my fave I
love it I would recommend this to
anybody of any skin tone this is a
fantastic drugstore palette I feel like
this compares to my high-end shadows and
I'm very very honest about that I don't
say that lightly if you look back at my
other drugstore palette videos you will
see I did not compare any of those the
Maybelline the L'Oreal the what else
Maybelline L'Oreal and the hard candy I
did not compare those to high-end I
would compare these to high-end I
wouldn't compare them to my most amazing
awesome high-end but I think that this
definitely compares I feel like you're
gonna be able to get the exact same
looks they're so easy to work with these
lasts all day
unlike the other palettes that I've
showed you from the elf line these lasts
all day so whoa I mean really really
really recommend the only problem I've
had with this was when I used the color
pop highlight and lunch money all over
my lid and use this one day and I did
find some creasing but the other than
that I've had no problems I put it over
Mac's Paint Pot patently I've put it
over a bin Decay's primer potion
yeah primer potion I've done it just by
itself without any primer and I have
absolutely loved this palette so highly
highly highly highly highly recommend
this one so that is my very rainy review
of all of my ELF products so overall my
must-haves if you're gonna call some
kind of makeup a must-have you know when
you're thinking beyond food water and
shelter these are my must-haves the
needed nude and the contour palette or
definitely must have followed
very very closely by the smoky eyes
palette which is also fab my don't buys
would be the lip product and the bronzer
palette the other ones are kind of in
between so I thank you so much for
watching if you're not already
subscribed you can click the subscribe
button down below so you're notified
when I make new videos I will be linking
at the end of this video and right there
my other drugstore palette reviews that
I did before this of the hard candy the
Maybelline and the L'Oreal new house
that came out recently in case you have
not seen that so you can see my opinions
on those palettes versus these but I can
tell you right now I'm gonna say that
the the needed nude one is definitely
going to top all of those so but if you
want to see the swatches and everything
for those that's where you can find
those so I thank you so much for
watching mad love and I will see you in
the next video
