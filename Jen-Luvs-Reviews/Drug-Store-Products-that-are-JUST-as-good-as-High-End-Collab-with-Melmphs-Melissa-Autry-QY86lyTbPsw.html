over there this is a seven oh I dropped
it hello my friends welcome to my video
on products that are drugstore but just
as good as high-end like no joke just as
good as high-end for me so what's the
point of spending a lot of money on
something when you can get something
just as good for a ridiculous amount
cheaper now this is in collaboration
with my friend Melissa over at mell mphs
her name you see Melissa Raymond now
it's Melissa Autry and we have been
friends for a very long time I think our
first email communication was about two
years ago so Melissa and I we go way
back but finally we've gotten a chance
to collaborate together and I'm so
excited to do this with her if you've
never seen Melissa's channel I
definitely recommend checking it out
she's been kind of switching things up
on her channel recently and I love the
changes that she's making I also really
like her more than make up with Mel
Channel that one has a lot more like
lifestyle kinds of things but it's a
really interesting twist on the
lifestyle video so I will link her
channel down below and also her video of
her favorite products that are just as
good as high-end but a lot cheaper so
let's go ahead and jump in town these
are products that worked well for me and
one thing I want you to keep in mind
especially if you're new to the channel
is that I do have normal skin which is
extremely abnormal I don't have oily
skin I don't have dry skin combination
skin I do not have problem skin in any
way so this product worked really really
well for me and I've heard it works
really well for a lot of people this is
the Garnier baby's baby scream the
Garnier baby scream this is the carnate
this is the Garnier BB cream in the
shade light/medium and this one's for
combination to oily skin I am wearing it
on my skin today it is a fantastic BB
cream it is a just a little tad bit more
coverage than a typical BB cream so
you're gonna get more of a light to
medium coverage you can build it up to a
little bit more of a medium you're never
gonna get full coverage out of this
thing but it really is wonderful it
lasts all day long it's definitely as
good as a high-end product and I highly
recommend next up I have to give a
shout-out to my absolute favorite
eyeliner this is the Jesse's girl
eyeliner I love this stuff I compare
this Jesse's girl eyeliner
to my Marc Jacobs and then this is this
is a $30 eyeliner and it is the magic
marker precision eyeliner pen in black
er this I actually like better but and
I'll tell you why it's that point is
very very similar and they go on just as
well but the only thing I like better
about the Jessie's girl is that it
doesn't smudge or flake off when I do a
wing it just goes straight on and it's
amazing now people ask me all the time
where you can buy these I get them
online at Jessie's girl calm also epsy
sometimes has Jessie's Girl deals so
keep your eye out for those on the epsy
website they also have discount codes on
epsy sometimes they don't think there's
anything right now but keep your eye out
for discount codes over there this is a
seven oh I dropped it this is a seven
dollar eyeliner craziness if you don't
want to go for this though this is
another one that's really good if you
want something that's a little more
accessible this is the Maybelline master
precise by eye studio now the tip on
this is more of a marker tip where the
Jesse's girl and the the Marc Jacobs are
more of a very fine pointed brush tip
but this one works just as well as far
as the application the blackness the
long lasting all of that the only thing
about this that I don't like is that you
can get some smudge enos over on the
sides for your wing but other than that
it works just as well and and what I
really like about this is the fine point
that's what you really need in a liquid
eyeliner is a flying point and this
definitely has that but this one is is
still quite a bit more expensive than
the Jesse's girl even with shipping
reapply my lip product this is one
that's kind of an honorable mention that
I just want to mention because I don't
think that is just as good as high-end
just because it is not as good of
ingredients as high-end but this is the
Maybelline Baby Lips bomb ball it is
kind of a dupe --is-- kind of thing for
the sugar rose lip tints I'm gonna go
ahead and show you swatches right now it
does basically the same thing but the
ingredients are definitely not as good
in the Baby Lips it's a lot more
chemicals and things like that so it's
not really as good as I am but if you
want the same look as the sugar rose and
you want the same feeling as the sugar
rose definitely would recommend these
brand new babies okay I have to I can't
stop I have too many things that I want
to tell you another product that is
definitely as good as high and
the elf contour palette I was shocked by
how much I love this oh my gosh it is an
amazing product I have used this one so
much it is so good I'm going to show you
some swatches this right here is an
exact dupe we're very very close to
exact dupe to the Smashbox palette the
Smashbox ballot is obnoxiously expensive
you only get three shades with the elf
you get four and it's only six bucks it
lasts just as long as the Smashbox one
the shades are extremely similar and
there's no reason to buy the Smashbox
just get the elf one it's it's really
really good and it's it works exactly
the way a contour palette should belong
with that I'm just gonna show you this
because I'm gonna try to sneak it in
here cuz I'm supposed to only do five
products but it's really hard for me I
use the elf blush brush for this and
this is a brush I reached for all the
time I have Sigma brushes I have a bunch
of other brushes that are very expensive
this one is still one that I reach for
takes a lot for me to want to reach for
a brush this is one I reach for all the
time I love the points on it it is so
fab and it just applies product
perfectly the elf blush brush this is
the three dollar version going on two
eyes I did use this eyeshadow on my eyes
today this is the J Kat beauty triple
crown baked eyeshadow I have a bunch of
these the only one I don't like is the
blue one but all of them are amazing
this one is in gild grilled mango almost
a gilded mango this one is in grilled
mango and that's what I have on my eyes
right now oh my gosh just amazing
amazing quality it is a perfect baked
eyeshadow you can get the J cat Beauty
eyeshadows at Ulta sometimes sometimes
you can get them on Ulta calm Drake at
Beauty also has a website where you can
get these and they're very very
inexpensive the lash sensational by
Maybelline amazing mascara if there's
one thing you do not need to spend a lot
of money on it is high-end mascara I
have gotten so many terrible high-end
mascaras that are just not worth
twenty-five thirty thirty-five dollars
for mascara i Maybelline lash
sensational oh my gosh so amazing
another one that's really good is the
l'oreal butterfly effect mascara i
really like that one a lot
lots of length lots of volume no flaking
no clumping
it's like magic there's a black version
of this that I don't like quite as much
as this but it's still really good now
everyone's lashes are different I have
short sparse lashes and these work this
works fantastic for me and the last one
I'm gonna sneak in is what's on my nails
right now this may not be accessible to
everybody but if you have a fight below
by you this is a five below brand nail
polish called fresh paint this stuff is
so always thinking amazing I've had this
nail polish on for two days and oh my
goodness there's no chips there's no
chips and this will last at least
another day without a chip maybe even
two more days without a chip and I
believe it was three dollars maybe two
dollars two or three dollars totally
amazing deal so that is it for my
favorite drugstore products that are
just as good as haiyan of course I have
quite a few more but I try to limit the
number that are in this video I would
