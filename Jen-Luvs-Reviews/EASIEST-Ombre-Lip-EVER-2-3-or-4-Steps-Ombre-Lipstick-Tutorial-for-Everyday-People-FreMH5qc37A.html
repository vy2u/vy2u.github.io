compliments on my lip from what's up and
makeup this week instead of trying to
explain and tell everybody what in the
world was on my lips I figured we just
doing everyday people makeup tutorials
so we're gonna do an ombre lip in three
steps right now
I don't know about you but I always get
intimidated by makeup artists and people
who are super talented with makeup doing
tutorials and that's why I never did
tutorials for a really long time and
that's why I don't watch a lot of
tutorials so I feel like I can't and do
them the concept behind everyday people
is I'm gonna show you how I figured out
how to do things that look complicated
but they're actually very easy so today
we're gonna do an ombre lip I'm gonna
show you four steps but really you can
do this in two steps but first we have
to zoom you in so you can see my lips
are very very close how we doing how we
doing now that you're all up in my face
I'll show you but we're gonna be using
the lip liner is kind of optional it's
really whether you are a lip liner
person whether you really want to make
sure that your lips are defined this
isn't a hundred percent necessary the
ones that are 100% necessary are a dark
lip product and a lighter lip product
that are in the same color family right
here is noisette by ua and then i have
home by bare minerals their liquid
lipstick and these are very very close
in shade they're just this one's darker
and this one's lighter the further you
get away from these being similar the
more dramatic your lip is going to be so
i'm going to go ahead and start off by
lining my lips with this this is color
pops a lip pencil in wild nothing and
you can see it's very similar I want my
lip liner to match as closely as I can
with the darker lip color
I always hate the way lipliner looks
like right now I feel like I've got a
mustaches like
your lips may not match up like mine
zoom I match up pretty well so you might
find that she needs a color in your
bottom lip but I just like to smack mine
together because it saves time and I
don't like to spend a lot of excess time
doing my makeup if I don't need to
especially if I've got somewhere to go
the purpose of the lip liner is again to
define your lip line it'll also help
your lipstick last longer now I'm gonna
take the darker color so whatever's your
darker color and just apply it all over
the lips I find that it's really
important when picking colors that you
want to get formulas that are kind of
similar they don't have to be exactly
the same but kind of similar you don't
want a liquid lipstick that's very
drying paired with one that's very
hydrating also pairing a shiny lip with
a matte lip is a little bit trickier to
do so you might want to start with
either two shinies or two maps so we're
doing two mattes today now this is the
ombre part it's super easy you take your
lighter color you put it in the middle
like and then you just do this then you
take your finger and kind of spread it
out in the center
if you need to apply a little more like
I did and now we have a very subtle
ombre lip the purpose of an ombre lip is
to make your lips look bigger so when
you lighten up the center of your lip it
makes the your lips pop out and it's
supposed to make them look more full now
this is the step that kind of brings it
more dramatic again this is not
necessary but I was filming for what's a
good makeup so this is what I did this
is the Solar Flare palette by BH
Cosmetics and what you want to do if you
want to use an eyeshadow to help you
with your hombres you definitely want to
check and make sure that it's lips safe
so this one the palette does say that it
has ultramarines in it ultramarines are
not lips safe but ultramarine is a blue
shade so I don't think that there's blue
in this one so I'm taking a shot and I'm
gonna use it anyway even though it says
may or may not contain ultramarines I
will put a list of all of the not safe
lip pigments here and also in the video
description for your reference so you
can check your eyeshadows to see whether
you can use them on your lips or not
today we're going to be using the shade
wavelength which is this one right here
and this is going to make my lips pop
even more I'm just gonna take this and
just dab it right in the center
and just kind of blend it out just a
little bit and again you want it the
most prominent in the center and then
blend it out to the side so you don't
want to Pat it over to the sides because
that'll give you too much product you
want it to be mostly in the center and
then blended out to the right and the
left and that is it that's the lift that
I was wearing and what's at the makeup
this week and I think it's beautiful for
fall let me zoom me out for final
thoughts this is a lip that I personally
probably wouldn't have worn to my
teaching job but it is something that I
would probably wear to the mall or even
just out running errands just because I
think it's so fun and fall but you have
to live with your comfort zone and what
you want to do the best time to practice
an ombre lip if you've never done before
is right before you're about to go to
bed when you've got a couple extra
minutes and you can't find something on
Netflix and you don't feel like playing
you know that game on your phone for the
millionth time go in your wherever you
do your makeup and practice with an
ombre lip it only takes a few minutes
and it's really a lot of fun all right
audience participation time if you have
found an ombre lip combination that
works really well for you leave that in
the comments below so we can all learn
from you in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness so let's all work
together to ombre and happiness in love
this is the second video in the everyday
people series I will be linking the last
one that I did right here below me it's
also going to be in the video
description
next week on what the K we're not gonna
be using a Korean product but a Chinese
product that helps you maybe possibly
dupe Korean products it is a face mask
maker thank you again so much for
watching mad love and I will see you in
a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
