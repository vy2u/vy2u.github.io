the K where we discussed Korean skincare
and what's good and what's not and
what's gimmicky and what's fun and
what's worth it
even though it's gimmicky and it's
because it's so fun so today we're going
to be testing out the Jody moly shiny
skin soap egg pore what caught my eye
about this is it looks like a little egg
carton and inside the little egg carton
you get two eggs they actually sell this
as a 4-pack as well where you get to
brown eggs and two white eggs and I've
heard I'm not sure where but I heard
that eggs are good for your hair and
your face so I thought hey let's try it
so before we get into the demo which
I've never used these before so the
first impression slanty demo of these
let me give you a little bit more detail
about these it was nine dollars on
Amazon from Tony moly for the two eggs I
ordered it on February 22nd it arrived
on February 24th so very very fast
shipping that comes out to four dollars
and fifty cents per egg or purse so p--
peach and lily does sell these for four
for thirty two dollars which is eight
dollars each or tony moly on their
website will sell them for four thirty
six dollars which is nine dollars each
to definitely get off amazon instead of
their website if you want to for some
reason walmart has a three pack which is
very very odd so i don't know if that
means three of the two packs because
they picture a two pack I don't know but
if you were going to get three eggs at
four thirty two dollars and sixty eight
cents that'd be about eleven dollars
each or four on my UK friends beauty
coat has them too for fourteen pounds
fifty so seven pounds twenty five each
Amelie re a little bit of the
description here it says the secret to
porcelain smooth skin these egg shaped
soaps are enriched with purifying red
clay calming coconut oil and egg white
extract to eliminate grime and control
excess sebum without leaving skin
feeling stripped use the brightening one
each morning and firming brown egg
before bed so we're going to try the
brown egg tonight the directions say
lather is soaked with water to produce a
foam like consistency and gently massage
into the entire face and rinse or you
can use it as a map according to this
website Tony Moly's website does not
talk about using it as a mask I got
these off the Beauty cult website Tony
moly does specifically say don't put it
on your eyes your lips so we're not
going to use this to take off I makeup
today but I am going to cleanse my face
I do have foundation on I have the NYX
drops the serum drop II things that are
relatively new I have those on today it
has been a full day so I'm sure they've
worn off to some extent and then we're
going to use a toning pad to see how
much of the makeup it has removed one
thing I thought that was very very
interesting about these is the website
claims that the the eggs are different
but when you look at the ingredients the
ingredients are exactly the same except
for for two very small thing so the
first one is that the brown egg has
something called yellow ochre or ochre
clay in it I couldn't find that as an
ingredient anywhere the only thing I
found was that yellow ochre was a
ingredient that using cosmetics at like
the beginning of finding out people use
clay to decorate body so I don't know as
far as modern uses of it and less is
tailing clay if it is tailing clay I
couldn't find any skin benefits to it
all I could find with it it's just kind
of typically used as like a bulking
agent or anti-caking agent it's used in
a lot of eyeshadows actually but the one
site that I did did say something about
it being good said that it's good for
eczema but the same site let me quote
this some people especially women tend
to consume talen and this condition is
called pica now pica is a disorder it's
not like they don't you it for health
benefit it's a disorder where people eat
things that aren't nutritious so for
example people may eat hair or paper or
metal or stones or dirt or glass and
kalynn so I don't take this as being a
reputable source if you know anything
about Kalyn and the benefits to the skin
I would love to know your sources I
personally couldn't find any benefits to
it you do need to watch out for this
product if you have sensitive skin I
found quite a few ingredients that are
not good for sensitive skin including
this one it's called tri panels on mine
it's a five on Environmental Working
Group for irritation concern because be
it's a strong alkaline substance sodium
hydroxide which is also known as lye is
also known as a skin irritant for some
people and it's something called
triclosan
triclosan is a seven on Environmental
Working Group it's a preservative to our
contamination concerns in irritation
concerns for this ingredient so if you
have sensitive skin I absolutely do not
recommend buying this product at all I
think that it will be very very bad
based on those ingredients and maybe
maybe not for everybody but they just
based solely on the ingredient list I
wouldn't recommend it to anybody with
sensitive skin I don't have sensitive
skin so I'm going to risk it to some
good ingredients that are in here lauric
acid which is the fatty acid that's in
coconut oil actual coconut oil is in
this palm oil Oh another negative one is
there are areas perfume in it so if you
are anti perfume in your products you
definitely do not want to buy this
you'll have a difference between a brown
egg in the white egg is that the egg
substance which is called hydrolyzed egg
protein is higher up in the white egg
than it is in the brown egg it seems to
be falling later so that would make you
assume that there's a possibility that
there may be more hydrolyzed egg protein
in the white than in the brown
but i couldn't find any evidence
anywhere of why this hydrolyzed egg
protein would be good for your skin I
couldn't find any research behind it
again if you have any research that you
have found on hydrolyzed egg protein of
why it's good for your skin I would love
to know about I personally couldn't find
anything that doesn't mean it doesn't
exist it just means I couldn't find it
so so far I'm finding things that are
not very impressive in the ingredients
at all I don't see any health or skin
benefits except for the coconut oil palm
oil I guess can be hydrating I mean
coconut oil is known for being really
good but I mean anybody can like coconut
oil on their face I mean it's the
no reason to buy this to get coconut oil
you know what I mean
and also there's so much other drying
irritating ingredients in this that it
probably wouldn't be worth it the
coconut oil in here so I really couldn't
find anything else good in it but we're
going to try it anyway because it's what
the Kay and it may work who knows but
I'm definitely not using it as a mask
and leaving it on my face I think that
would be a bad idea so let's go ahead
we're going to go into my bathroom and
we're going to try this out now my
husband asleep in the other room so I'm
not going to be talking during this part
we'll come back in here afterward and
talk about what happened
all right so let's talk about what
happens so I feel like I'm like really
close to you all of a sudden like let's
back up a little bit let's you know back
up out of your space a little so I have
to admit this stuff does work it took my
makeup off beautifully it did a
fantastic job very impressed by that but
my face does feel a little bit tight on
the side that I didn't tone I've
cleansed my face with soap before and it
gives like that really tight feeling it
doesn't feel like that it doesn't feel
bad but definitely doesn't feel hydrated
in any way and there really weren't
enough hydrating ingredients in the soap
for me to feel like it should feel
hydrated it was it a functional product
did it cleanse my skin absolutely but
I'm really really not impressed with the
ingredients in this product so at this
point I wouldn't recommend it just
because the ingredients kind of freaked
me out a little bit the storage of this
this is only a paper carton here so I
would imagine that after using this
multiple times if you do get this wet
that it will get yucky and you will have
to throw this container away so you may
want to find a different place to store
your soap if you do choose to buy this
so I'm kind of on the fence on this one
because it does work but at the same
time I wish that there were better
ingredients in it that could make me say
hey yes definitely go out and get this
but there's so many irritating
ingredients in this and so many red flag
ingredients that I personally can't
recommend it to you even though it does
actually work I also don't like that
they count the differences between the
brown egg and the white egg when there
really is very little difference between
the two eggs that kind of bothers me a
little bit it seems like false marketing
and I just don't like it when when they
kind of say that it is something when it
isn't they also mention red clay where
there's no red clay in it it's actually
yellow clay I mean I don't know there's
just something weird going on here with
the marketing of it that just kind of
rubs me the wrong way you know what I'm
saying so
I can't give a bad rating because it
works but I can't give a good rating
because of all those other reasons so
it's up to you I mean you're going to
have to kind of look at this and the
facts and what happened and all of that
and decide whether this is something you
want to buy or not that's just for what
