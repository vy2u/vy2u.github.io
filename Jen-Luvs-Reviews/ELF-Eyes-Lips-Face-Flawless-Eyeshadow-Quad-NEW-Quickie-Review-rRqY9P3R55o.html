for today and today we're going to be
talking about being new elf flawless eye
shadow I saw this at Target and I don't
know if it was on the website for a
while and now it's a target but it said
new one and I got excited and I was like
yes this is so cool this is the palette
in happy hour I'm gonna take you through
the same process that I went through in
trying this so I saw it and I was like
okay I'll start a new eyeshadow very
cool maybe it's like the wet and wild
eyes shadow and I love the wet and wild
palette eye shadow so I opened it up and
on what's uh well the little lines are a
little skinny for my brush to fit in
this is the brush I typically use to put
on my eyeshadow and it's huge compared
to the space so I was like well I'll
just have to find another brush to use
when I use this palette no big deal let
me show you the swatches and here's the
one that says base and you're supposed
to put this one all over your lid
swatches gorgeous look how pretty that
is absolutely course yes alright here's
the one that says lid it's over like a
pinky purple a little bit of powder on
there but not bad okay this one says
crease super excited about that one
still a little powdery okay and then
this one says line so why don't you
swatch him like Oh gorgeous again a
little powdery but I can deal with
powdery actually you know tap my brush
off no big deal so then I go to I put
them on and I blend them in eyeshadows
and this is literally what happened when
I blended them they're gone for the most
part I can't say they're completely gone
but they faded considerably I was so
disappointed in that now if you like a
very light eye look or if you're not
used to using eyeshadow and you want to
try something that's not gonna really be
thick on your eye you might like this
but for me I like my collar to be bone
and bright when they're bright colours
this was a big no for me I did not think
that they are even worth two dollars
unless I was going to just buy it for
this bottom so that is my opinion on the
elf new flawless eyeshadows
I hope that was helpful for you if
you've got other colors or if you had
different experiences with these please
leave in the comments down below I would
love to hear about it especially if
there's one of these that you really
enjoyed that I don't own maybe I'll pick
it up so alright mad love and I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
