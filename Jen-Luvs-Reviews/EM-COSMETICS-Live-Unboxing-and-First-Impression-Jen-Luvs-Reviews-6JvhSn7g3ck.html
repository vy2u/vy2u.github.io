impromptu livestream I love doing these
impromptu live streams they were very
fun oh just so you know I get lots of
questions about her the artist name is
kaya Koopman she's amazing
okay so M cosmetics if you do not know
Michelle Phan who started out as a
youtuber now she owns FC she owned it M
cosmetics and then that no she didn't
own it L'Oreal owned it and she they
kind of partnered together hi everybody
they kind of partnered together and they
came up with a big damn cosmetics well
it kind of flopped
so Michelle bought the rights back to em
cosmetics and now she's doing it all on
her own on her own terms so I'm really
excited to try out the new line I was
actually pushed on Twitter I had a
couple of my Twitter friends like Jen
tryam cosmetic side a couple of comments
in the YouTube comments as well to try
on cosmetics so I just wanted to a quick
unboxing this was not paid for with
super Chat money this was faith playful
with my money so it comes with this here
um oh no Megan says I heard nothing but
bad things about the Odom cosmetics oh
the OM comes in cosmetics yes I own
quite a bit it was it wasn't great it
really wasn't I don't think there was
anything in the line that I was like
yours is amazing like some of the stuff
was okay but you know hello in Portugal
in Norway okay so this is the card it
says hello beautiful thank you for
welcoming em into your beauty collection
much love and care went into all aspects
of this brand from design and product in
color I cannot wait to see the look
should create please be sure to tag me
at em cosmetics and hash tag em
cosmetics so I can see your beauty and
magic much love thanks and good luck
Michelle always right good luck on
everything I don't know if that's
backwards to you it looks backwards to
me I don't know if you can get it in
Canada I'm not really sure if you go to
an cosmetics you should be able to see
it hi Calvin
okay so let's see so first I got um they
don't have a whole lot of stuff they
only have eyeliners and lip products so
this is the infinite lip cloud and I got
a few of those I think I got four of
those and then I got both eyeliners so
this one is in the shade French nude
let's go ahead oh it's got a
this is the box I like the new logo the
new logo is cool if you don't know
Michelle Phan is also an artist so how
do I even get this thing open without
scissors do I need says oh it's tape
hold on let me get my scissors cuz it's
kind of taped on I didn't realize that
okay
good thing I had scissors right there oh
nice
hi somebody said that um if you were
watching this on the replay somebody
said that the I didn't see who it was um
said that that the felt tip eyeliner is
there
holy cool new Holy Grail which is
awesome Thank You Jennifer she says she
likes my scarf okay I'm gonna stop
interrupting the unboxing I'm so sorry
oh hi from Memphis Ida Memphis okay I'm
gonna stop now I'm gonna stop saying hi
to people and I'm gonna do this okay so
M cosmics that is really beautiful I
love the gold print there um this is not
soft like nor Zee kind it's um it's
smooth and then it's got the gold tapia
which is really cool okay so a little
bit of a chocolate said it reminds me of
the bareMinerals Jen nude scent not
quite as opaque as the Jen nude it's a
little bit streaky er than that but it
reminds me a lot of that formula I'm
just gonna put it on over top of this
because I want to feel how it feels it
feels like the genuine it's got a little
divot there can you see that totally
feels like the Judd nudes so um okay so
anyway I keep wanting to talk to people
but I was told that I shouldn't do that
cuz it's good it's distracting okay so
anyway I think it looks really really
pretty I like that shade and again this
is a shade French nude so let's go into
the other ones um Debbie says the screen
froze I hope it's not completely frozen
hopefully everybody else is okay this is
a new one um oh my gosh any stop reading
and you stop I'm so bad this don't do
there's no talk to you I just don't want
people on the replay to be bored okay as
I make them bored okay this this sheet
is called I'm soaping up the bottom this
is
Rose node and I'm going to go ahead and
put that over here
they're very comfortable I would imagine
they would not be transfer proof so
there really isn't a whole lot of
difference between the two this one's
just a little dustier so thank you Katie
oh I know Stephanie I should just talk
to you I should just be me and not
listen to other people fizzy pop said
that makes my lips look bigger that's
cool
okay this one I'm just throwing stuff
around this is the shade violent magenta
look at that Katie I do need to just be
me you're absolutely right sometimes I
listen too much and don't just be me ooh
that's that is very interesting see how
it's not opaque it still has that scent
though that's really interesting it
looks like it's gonna stain hi de
portugal Oh Thank You Jennifer I'm just
gonna be me I'm gonna talk to people I'm
sorry I can't
all right this is muted mall forget the
scissors under stepping from the bottom
and then this is let's see put that over
here so only got the one like more wild
color and it definitely looks like a
different formula it's much more sheer
looking so that's the muted mall so
there really isn't a whole lot of
difference there is a difference between
them there just isn't a lot so um yeah I
really like the first impression wise
but I mean I can tell that this is
definitely not gonna be trans proof
yeah the berry does looks tricky doesn't
it Meredith I'm curious what that's
gonna look like I'm just gonna layer it
on oh yeah see it just came right off
but that's the way that bare minerals
are - and I love those alright let's try
this one
ooh the sun's going down sorry about the
lighting change yeah that's weird I
don't like that one at all
first impression that's pretty sing and
terrible you know that one's really
patchy let me turn this other leg the
sign I just lost my sunlight
now we're yellow but oh well it's whoa
horn mmm sorry I'm just like butchering
this I don't even have a mirror it's
looking at myself isn't this one's awful
so morning
fair warning do not like that one is
called there they go
that one is called violent magenta
violent or violet violent mm-hmm try
shaking it so um this is uh michelle
phan who owns epsy this is her brand
okay I shook it and it looks like it's
doing the same thing I don't know if
that's it's a very thick formula so I
don't know if that would make a big
difference so okay so that's the lip
products I don't even want to keep that
all and that looks so bad
I'm sure I can doctor it somehow with
like a lip balm or something but it
definitely feels less transfer nope
still transferring oh well be from the
dreamcatcher is here hi V okay M
cosmetics which one is this
this is the illustrative eyeliner
felt-tip so that is how that looks
and these looked really cool ooh very
inky this is going to be really really
nice kathleenlights had a great
experience with these oh good to know
so this is um the point is very very
fine which is great for like waiting it
out so that's cool we'll let that set
and then we'll let see a little smudge
LexA says she needs a new eyeliner well
maybe this will be an option this is the
illustrative eyeliner brush tip they
don't look that different okay so the
difference is I'll tell you the
difference it looks like the marker tip
is a little bit blacker and it looks
like the felt the felt tip is bendier
it's not quite as stiff so it really
just depends on what you
like um I personally feel like I'm going
to like the marker tip better because
the felt tip seems a little too bendy
but I haven't put on my eyes yet so it's
kind of hard to say the only place that
this is sold is online it's a new indie
brand so that was a question that was
just asked winged liner everyday kind of
girl I always kind of do like a little
tiny wing so Stevie's girl says she
likes the brush tip better I'll have to
try them on my eyes and see so I will
keep you all updated on this so far I
really really like the nude because
they're very similar to the bare
minerals Jen nude I mean they are
they're almost I'd be curious to know
whether these shades are dukes I have a
bunch of them upstairs in my makeup room
I'm going to swatch these and see if I
can find any dupes if I find any dupes
with bare minerals I will put it in the
description box after this video renders
after I finish making my dinner then my
oven is now preheated but they've seen
it almost like the exact same formula
but they're really similar the way they
feel the way they smell so I wish that I
had known that before Lander I don't
know I guess I could have done this as
like a plan video or whatever but you
know and unlike ingredient Alice's
comparison and things like that so um
nd brand means independently-owned so
someone asked what indie brand was
usually there's smaller companies so hi
Janis okay so anyway I want to go ahead
and pop off here and I'm going to go
make my dinner but I just wanted to show
you those to see if you were interested
in these since these just came out so
the only fail Oh
the only fails so far is this lipstick
the one so I want to thank you so much
for being here if you were here live I
appreciate you if you're watching this
on the replay thank you again so much
for for watching um
saucer just wants to know if it's worth
ordering online I don't know I guess it
just depends on whether you like them or
not
I'll have to look at like the price
comparison with bare minerals because
they really do feel and smell exactly
the same it's very interesting so yeah I
just wanted to show these to you since
you just got them so thanks again for
being here and I'd love and I'll see you
in a video soon coming up next week is
the larog pirate's collection coming up
either Tuesday or Wednesday I'm going to
try to x' day cross my fingers will be
Tuesday all right mad love bye guys
thanks for being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
