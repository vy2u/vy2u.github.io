what does my face tell you so dramatic
does it say that I'm vain my vain what
does it tell you that I'm strong where
am i strong run this company Sunday
definitely bold no way it's kind of yeah
that's motivational I am what I make up
and we're about to see whether this
makeup is as dramatic and magical as
covergirl tells us it is we're getting
started right now hello my friends I'm
very excited today because I have been
trying these products for like a month
and I finally finally have it together
to tell you what I think of all of these
covergirl products that were sent to me
so many of my friends got the same box
and I'm so thankful that covergirl was
able to reach out not just to these
super large influencers but some of us
that are not so large and giving us a
chance to try their spring line and in
this box is cover girls entire spring
line I tried most of the things in here
hello editing Jen here already
this video is way longer than I thought
it was going to be so I will put
timestamps down in the video description
if you want to skip just directly to my
full review that time stamp is down
below so make sure you click there don't
feel like you have to watch the whole
thing but there's a lot of really cool
stuff that I'm gonna do in this video to
demonstrate the products and show how
they works if you're interested in that
definitely watch the whole thing if you
want to skip ahead you're not hurting my
feelings that your time is valuable
definitely use those time stamps down in
the video
description and let's go ahead and get
started so what I figured we would do
today is I will not only give you
swatches of every single lip product in
this box that includes this top tray as
well as this entire rule if I can show
you second tray of lip products we're
also going to be doing a dupe wear test
and what I mean by that is I'm going to
be able applying these covergirl
products on one side of my face and then
testing them against some high-end
products on the other side of my face
we're gonna do a wear test and we're
gonna see whether these covergirl
products can hang with the high-end
counterparts and I'm really excited for
this video because I've never made a
video quite like this but I've made
things similar and I just feel like my
channel is evolving in a really neat
direction and I'm excited to do this
with you so let's go ahead and get going
and let me tell you what is in this box
so first we got all of the covergirl
melting pout maps in the second drawer
we have all of the katie-cat lip glosses
as well as the Queen Maj shade lipsticks
in the eyes drawer we have a bunch of
brow products we have some twists up a
brow pencils also some brow gels brow
pomade a kind of thing down in the
bottom here there's also three eyeshadow
palettes there's a bunch of liquid
eyeliners in here some mascaras and an
eyeshadow primer and finally in the skin
drawer we have two of the vitalist glow
luminizing lotions we have four pressed
powders and I do believe this is the
entire shade range won't want wha and it
gets even more want want as I tell you
what I think of it and then we've got
these healthy glow highlighters they're
really weird we'll get to those there's
also a true blend up retouching palettes
I believe this is a color correcting
palette and then over here concealers I
also believe that that is the entire
range I'm not sure if you can see the
shades but again won't want long don't
worry my dark skinned beauties you are
not missing out on much but we'll get to
that
and then here covergirl lock up all day
setting mist and that was what was in
the box okay so where we're gonna start
with this is with the vitalist Go glow
luminizing lotion I've been using this
kind of like a face primer and we're
going to compare that with the cover if
that's luminizing primer
we'll have my left side which is on your
right hand side of the screen be the
covergirl side and then the left side is
going to be the high end side so one
thing I've noticed about this particular
product is that it blends right into the
skin there is no pigment once you start
rubbing it in it also has a very very
pleasant scent it's almost a beachy kind
of scent it smells very nice to me it
almost has a little bit of an oily
texture to it so if you don't like that
you probably won't like this very much
personally I really like it and I do
feel like it compares to the cover
effects this is the illuminating a
primer a base and we'll go ahead and put
that on this side I've been really
digging on the luminize look recently
now for me because I have normal skin I
don't I just put my primer everywhere I
don't have any place like my t-zone
where I have to be extra careful or
anything so I just kind of slop it all
over my face that's what I do with it
because they did not include a
foundation I'm just gonna go ahead and
use my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation for both sides of my face and
that way we know we have the same going
on for both sides because we're testing
the the lotion not the foundation so
we're gonna do the same thing on both
sides and also I know this foundation
really well so I know what it normally
does so I know if something funky is
going on I'm gonna be able to pick it
out Bom Bom Bom actually let me go ahead
and zoom you in so you can really see
what I'm doing here one thing I realized
is I forgot to do my little spiel at the
beginning about covergirl as a brand I
guess because I just assume everybody
already knows about covergirl but you
should not assume you know what they say
when you assume right so covergirl is
not a cruelty free brand they are a
drugstore brand so they are more
affordably priced than other places the
reason why they are not cruelty free is
because they do sell their products
mainland China and China does test all
of their foreign products on animals at
least mainland China does not Hong Kong
but they do test all of their products
on animals so when a brand agrees to
sell in China they know that their
products are going to be sold tested on
animals so therefore they're kind of in
a way condoning the animal testing
covergirl does not test on animals in
the United States and one thing that's
really odd like speaking of the United
States is that some of covergirl
products like this this is made in the
United States but other of their
products some of them are made in France
some of them are made in Canada I don't
think any of them are made in China I
think it's really interesting especially
for a less expensive brand let's go
ahead and go into the brow products
gonna read what these things are so this
thing is called the easy breezy brow
micro-fine plus define brow pencil and
this is called the easy breezy brow
skull plus set brow pomade whew that's a
mouthful so let's go ahead and apply
those and just so you know as far as
brow pencils go the roll up kind or the
worst deal out there if you want the
biggest bang for your buck you do not
want to get a roll up brow pencil
because you are paying thousands of
dollars per ounce and I'm not
exaggerating there either no matter what
brand you get but if you need a very
sharp point this one is very good there
are a lot of brow pencils out there like
this some of them are definitely not
good because they take some scrubbing to
put on your brows but like this one the
Anastasio one the benefit one the Too
Faced want the L'Oreal one the one even
from unique believe it or not they're
all pretty much the same single thing
even some of the formulas are very very
similar so is the covergirl one good yes
yes it's good I do like it okay so let's
go into the pomade I also really really
like the palmate let me show you how
this works so what you do is you take
this little little brushy thing out and
you're supposed to clip it back in and
then use this like a handle I find this
to be a little too wiggly jiggly I don't
like it so I just take that part off and
I just use the little tiny grip here and
that's that's
good enough for me and there's a little
gel inside you don't get a lot of
product in this which kind of stinks but
it works very very well I don't find it
to run through the day or anything it's
very nice and it fills in my brows very
very well I do believe there's only four
shades available that's my only thing is
that I wish that there were more shades
honest Asya kills it in the shade
selection part I'm just gonna go back
into the spoolie and spoolie this baby
out I don't spend a lot of time on my
brows I probably should spend more time
on my brows but I don't and this is one
of my favorite brow products I really
like this a lot this is the Cobra by
benefit and this is probably my favorite
brow gel brow pomade of all time I like
it better than the anastacio because it
isn't quite as opaque I actually like it
a little better than the covergirl as
well and I just noticed that's a little
bit darker than the covergirl hmm and I
put it on a little bit thicker trying to
split it out a little more what is it
twins not sisters not twins I think
that's what we've got going on today
all right eye shadow primer if you've
been around my channel for the past
month or so I cannot stop raving about
this stuff this is the covergirl lid
lock up we're going to put that
head-to-head with Urban Decay's primer
potion the original one and I'm gonna
show you how amazing this stuff is and
I've noticed more and more reviews
talking about how awesome this is and
when I first started talking about it I
don't know if I had seen any reviews and
I'm like I hope this works for other
people because it really works for me
let's have a texture of this so it is a
little bit sticky it doesn't feel like
the urban decay the urban decay is much
smoother this one has a little tackiness
to it like right now as my eyes opening
and closing I can feel a little
tackiness to it that I don't feel with
any other primer that I own the urban
decay is definitely whaler so if you
have a problem with the urban decay
because it is oily ER you will probably
like the cover girl much better now with
the eyeshadow I feel kind of bad because
I'm at this video and I never tried this
product this is the smoky palette I'm
actually not going to try this I have
had such bad luck with the covergirl
true Naked palette that I just I didn't
even give it a chance and I feel
because I feel like I should have given
it a chance but I didn't instead were to
use the katie-cat pallets and we're
gonna do a combination of a look between
these two pallets and we're gonna do the
same look on both eyes that way we can
test the eyeshadow primer I'm just gonna
set up the look with some of these more
neutral shades and then we'll put some
fun pops of color on there and when I'm
finding mostly with this palette overall
is that it without eyeshadow primer the
lasting power is terrible it's so bad
it'll barely last through a six hour day
before it's like muddy and coming off
and just awful but with the eyeshadow
primer actually works pretty well so I'm
just gonna dip into this shade right
here and just put that in my crease and
in case you are new to my channel I
don't do tutorials my my job I feel here
is not to give you the most artistic
beautiful look that's not what I do here
even though I know that's what a lot of
people do what I just want to do is put
this on my face in a way that you may
put it on your face possibly so that we
can see whether it works well or not and
you might be able to already notice that
the pigmentation here seems a little bit
darker and that's because of the
tackiness of that primer it really holds
on to the product okay now I'm just
gonna deepen it up a little bit with
this shade here this one does have a
little bit of shimmer in it but when you
apply it you don't really see it much
you
let's go into this other one this
palette is called the cool cat palette
and I think I want to do a look with the
this shade right here it's a green brown
shade and then this like tle kind of
like light blue color I think that would
be really fun so I'm just gonna start
patting that on with my fingertip and it
is very creamy and I'm surprised because
usually drugstore eye shadows are very
powdery I am NOT a fan overall of
drugstore eyeshadows I find them to be
powdery I find them to be difficult to
work with and I don't enjoy them so I
found this to be a nice surprise can you
see the duochrome shift in there I mean
it's nothing super unique and that lots
of brands have a duo chrome you know
green green brown blue Brown kind of
shade but I think it's very pretty and I
think they did do a really nice job with
this color now I'm gonna go ahead and
put the teal which kind of shade on the
middle to the inner corner I mean it's
just very very beautiful it's not super
opaque though that's one thing I have to
say about it that if you really want it
to be very opaque you're gonna need to
apply it over a white base and I'm just
gonna take this little Sigma each one a
brush and just pull this little this
shade over here into the inner corner
just to give it a little pop in there
little silver pop and to kind of pull it
all together I'm going to use this
glittery black just gently in my crease
to just kind of pull everything together
just a little tiny bit on each side
you
I feel like through the blending I kind
of lost a little bit of the green brown
so I'm gonna apply just a little bit
more of that just to make sure that
doesn't get lost on the outer corner
just brighten that back up and a little
more of the blue because it blend it in
a little bit too much and for lower
lashline we'll just go over back over to
the other pallet and we will throw this
black it's more of a matte black down on
the lower lash line
I'm wiping off any excess powder there
because I don't want any more product
that's plenty of product I'm just gonna
smoke out what's there okay I shadow is
done let's go ahead and do a liquid
liner I tried every one of these liquid
liners there's a teal there's a brown
there's a glitter black there's a matte
black and then there's a glossy black
and honestly I really like all of them
this is the thing though at first I
hated them and the reason why is because
I didn't shake them up if you buy these
please make sure you shake it up because
if you don't you're gonna end up with
just glossy liquid it's stupid it looks
terrible you just make sure you shake it
one thing I do not like about these is
they don't have the color names written
on them they just have numbers so you
have to like for me I would have to look
up the number in order to know which one
I'm using so right now I don't know if
I've got the glossy black or the matte
black I know it's one of the other but I
don't know which one
shake aid up and one thing I absolutely
love about this liner is that it's so so
so fine makes it really really easy to
apply even if you're a beginner at
liquid liner I think this is fabulous
especially if you do not have I wrinkles
because it does tend to get hung up a
little bit in eye wrinkles and it can
seep a little bit into my fine lines but
not bad I've definitely had worse but
because it's so fine it's very easy to
work with and it's easy to get a nice
thin line all right now on the right
side I'm gonna use the bombs
Schwing eyeliner this is the only
eyeliner that I own that is not a pen
because I prefer pens overall
should I do a wing yeah let's go ahead
and do a wing but I have to like put the
mirror down in order to do the wing so
I'm gonna do the wing off camera off
your right back okay you ever have that
moment when you're doing your eyeliner
and you make it just a little bit little
bit bigger a little bit bigger and the
next thing you know you're Amy Winehouse
that is exactly what just happened to me
totally Amy Winehouse right now oh my
gosh on the bomb one look at this it's
like transferring up into my crease this
is terrible don't worry we're gonna fix
it it's called my solar water and q-tips
oh my gosh you've got this we've got
this everything I've got eyeliner my
face now all right let's go off to
become a covergirl side it's like not
even smudging a hall well that's
interesting this is actually quite an
interesting little happy experiment here
that we just did this yeah look how much
easier that came off and the bombs one
the bomb one like smeared everywhere
that was like super vast and easy
well that's good to know see happy
accidents happy accidents I don't know
what is happening over here but we're
gonna fix it try to make my eyes go back
to matching a little bit
you
so should we try to do the wings again
should we dare let's dare it's just a
little wings this time just little
little wings come on Jen you can do this
I better not mess this up again now the
pressure is on I'm feeling I'm feeling
the pressure there we go little wings
not big wings all right let's go into
concealer I'm feeling the need for
concealer okay so the concealer shade
range is really really sad the need for
these three shades to be different it's
it's like are you kidding me are you
kidding me these are three of the shades
you chose like I could pick any one of
these and think that I was doing the
right thing I mean they look almost
exactly the same and the thing is is
none of them are labeled like at all so
I don't even know what shade this is
they just all look thinking the same my
friend shy from makeup struggles got the
same box and she's like yeah these are
the darkest shades they make should I
like laughed she's like you've got to be
kidding me when I talked to her about it
I was like there's no way you've got the
same box to me she was like you up every
single shade was light so these are the
darkest shades that are in there just no
no no no bad covergirl bad covergirl
it's one of those roll up click up kinds
of products which are definitely not my
favorites and this concealer I can tell
you right now I don't like and the
reason why I don't like it is because it
doesn't really do anything it's just
it's super super super low coverage
click really low coverage
I should have gotten my smaller one of
these but I'm being lazy it's got a
little bit of coverage there but for the
most part it doesn't really do very much
the closest thing I have to this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin this is in the
shade fair neutral but you can just see
how much creamier that is and I think
part of that is the applicator too that
I just really don't like those click up
applicators at all and I'm really
regretting that I didn't just suck it up
and get the right brush because this is
not applying the way I normally would I
should have done it differently but I
can't go back now I got to go pick up my
kids from the bus stop soon I would not
invest my money in it unless you want
something super super super just the
littlest bit of coverage or if you're
just trying to brighten a little bit
then I can see maybe liking it but if
you wanted actually to cover anything
it's not good speaking of terrible shade
ranges check out these shades the
powders it's so sad it's so sad this is
the lightest shade of powder and it's
too dark for me and I'm more of like a
light edging on like me I'm occasionally
depending on the line
the next lightest one is this one I
don't want to open it but like I'll hold
them hold them next to each other that's
the the next lightest one these are the
two medium shades I can't even say these
are even close to deep but just know
that I know that you know and you know
that I know that this does not match my
skin tone at all I'm just going to pack
this under my eyes first
and the higher end product we're gonna
use this from cure this is their four
and one pressed mineral makeup this is
the closest I had to something like this
because lately I really have been
preferring the I really have them
preferring the the more loose powders I
so need to get my brows done like really
Runa babe so now we're gonna go ahead
and get into the mascara for mascara
they sent two peacocks their mascaras
one of them is the hydro fuse which is
the waterproof and one is the regular
they're both awful they're both just
really bad they don't do anything but
we're gonna put it on anyway just
because we're doing this and we're gonna
do it
so we'll put on the regular because I'm
not a fan of waterproof mascara is just
because I don't like having to take off
waterproof mascaras it's such a dry
mascara it's so dry you can't even
barely get the product under your lashes
and the wand is way too long look I
don't even know what they were thinking
with these like backhand bristles here
like I don't I have no idea what the
logic was they're like what are those
exactly supposed to do like who designed
this and can I speak with you because
this is not that's not functional it's
not logical they don't get to the hairs
at all and I'm having so much trouble
getting any product out of this tube
okay so there's one coat go ahead and go
in with the second coat I almost wish
they hadn't included a mascara so I
could just wear falsies I think falsies
would look really pretty with this look
I've definitely got clumps coming off
out of the product I mean this is just
mascara is not good I've been kind of
neglecting my mascara game lately so all
I have right now is the tardis mascara
it's the like only one that I'm really
messing with that's high-end right now
so we'll just put that on the other side
but I don't really think these even
compare really because I think the
TARDIS is definitely meant for more
volume I totally got scare on my face
but it's it's definitely a little more
dry at least now that it's aged a little
bit it's gotten a little drier but I
mean they don't even compare I'm just
gonna stop there because I don't want me
to be that much different if I keep
going with layering this they're gonna
be drastically different they're already
are pretty different but let me just go
out and close my eyes so you can see
what we've got going on so far now these
healthy glow things I don't really get
these but these seem like they would be
way better on a person of color than on
me like there is no way I could use that
as a highlighter there's just no way so
at least there's something at least
there's something and oh and then
there's the queen lipsticks which we'll
get into in a minute but like there's
only a couple of these that I feel like
I can personally use but not complaining
that they actually have something in
here that might work for people of color
but I'm just going to go ahead and I'm
going to use this one right here this
one is the shade I don't know because it
doesn't say on here because this entire
line is not labeled I guess they just
didn't want to name things this one's
called number three and it is kind of a
rose gold kind of shade and it's just a
very odd highlighter very odd let me
show you this kind of sets onto the skin
rather than sinking into the skin this
is a concern for me because I have not
used this in about a week and it's
starting to dry out a little bit when I
first got this it felt kind of oily
where now it is much more creamy and
it's
a lot easier to work with than it was
when I first got it but that concerns me
that it's gonna dry out even further
that's actually much more beautiful than
when I was using it when I first got the
package see the glow it's it's very
pretty I'm surprised this one right here
I hadn't used yet and it just got kind
of an oily texture to it where this one
has kind of dried a little bit and this
one's a little bit more creamy now like
a little more not bouncy but a little
more color poppy a little it's got a
little more like clay almost feeling to
it and for my high and I'm gonna use the
Fenty Beauty shade this one is in chic
freak and we're gonna put down the other
side I know it's not a cream formula but
the shades are kind of similar
yeah the finishes are totally different
my biggest concern right now is the
drying up factor that died that is is
what I'm concerned about and I will
definitely keep you posted in the video
description about that
there's no blush or contour in this
collection so I'm not gonna put any on
because I don't want to mess with the
rest of everything by adding in blush
and contour I want you to be able to see
what everything is doing that we're
actually reviewing today so that this is
gonna be kind of an unfinished look and
that I'm not going to use those kinds of
products but we are going to do is we
are going to put on lip products there
are a ton of lip products in here I am
gonna show you swatches of everything in
just a minute but but yeah but I do have
a dupe for you my absolute favorite
discovery for lips in this kit was the
covergirl Queen major shade liquid
lipstick in the shade
and it is pretty much a spot-on dupe for
dose of colors Mondays which is one of
my favorite shades of all time so let's
go ahead and put that on either side
it's so weird putting it just on half my
lips so not used to doing that well even
it out eventually I do like the doze of
colours applicator much better it's
softer
man I thought it was in executive until
now they're next to each other my lips
will see if it oxidizes because I think
that it will and they're close enough
that I don't think anybody the bus stop
is going to notice and we're just
testing how it wears anyway so I'm just
gonna let it be let it be let it be it's
not perfect it's a little weird and
application but we'll be able to check
the wear time of it I definitely see a
lot more color here on my cheek from the
covergirl than I did do with the Fenty
it's more of a blush and highlighter
together which is interesting I'm just
gonna add I'm just adding a little bit
more of the shadow because I feel like
it's already kind of mushed on both
sides a little bit so just to make sure
I'm fair I'm adding it onto both sides
kind of blending it trying to make them
match as exactly as possible there we go
that's a little better
now they match a little bit better so
let me go ahead and let's just talk
about look at my face
let's look close up let me got going on
both sides covergirl high-end we're
doing okay let me go ahead and zoom you
out alright so at this point we are
going to take a little break and you are
going to take a little break to see lip
swatches and while you're watching the
lip swatches many many hours will be
going by in my time and I will be able
to show you the wear test and show you
how these things laughs it on my face
for the rest of the day it is kind of
late it is currently just after 4
o'clock and I need to go pick up my kids
so yeah I'm late for the bus and I will
see you guys in a little while check out
those swatches right now
take a moment right here feeling like a
soggy driving towards the Sun where the
rolls in don't feel the weight in my
No
dangerous but it's awful
till my buzzer time done and luckily my
mama see what will you do with your life
you know it's hard to survive a second
my mouth may begin C but proud
on your neck don't stand up did I do
and if my phone don't buzz when the
morning comes did you spend the night
but I'm all right I'm all I still might
rise till I try what a few order fires
been an eye on boys
and is that something I love don't
specie here like it does to me and if
not insane then I'll say goodbye so
carefully I'm alright
the might rise for my tribe
what if you order five for the night
I tried you the track
I tried
what did you
and if the words that we say climb up
all the way can we keep them there if
it's too far to fall and he's nothing it
all on too crazy the cares it's not
right it's not right still might rise to
by surprise or a few fortified
I'll write my friends it has been oh my
goodness I was like five minutes late
picking up my kids my neighbor was
walking my kids home and oh my god so
bad but it's 624 which means it's been
about two hours
I just wanted to mostly check in on the
lipstick because I just ate dinner this
is what we had for dinner it is pork
shoe my meatballs with ponzu dipping
sauce and it's a snap peas but we had
green beans instead I just wanted to
show you how my lipstick wore I didn't
wipe it off like I didn't use a napkin
or anything I tried not to I tried to
like keep my lips as clean as possible
but there was oil there's sesame oil and
different things there's ponzu sauce
stuff like that in our so let me zoom
you in so you can see how my lipsticks
is lasting so remember this side is the
dose of colors this side is the
covergirl they're both wearing away on
the inner part of my lips with which
makes sense because I was eating oils
but other than that they pretty much
look the same I'm gonna go ahead and do
a quick little touch-up because it looks
a little crazy right now I'm surprised
that they did end up matching pretty
closely just gonna go ahead and see how
this layers so if you know you're out at
a restaurant and you eat and you want to
reapply overtop let's see how that works
start with covergirl side note dose of
colors is one of my favorite lips liquid
lipstick formulas remember as it dries
down they're gonna end up matching
pretty closely but I feel like they
layered really nicely overtop I think it
looks really good
so I am headed to ukulele lessons let's
check in again this has only been two
hours but I'm headed to ukulele and then
we will be back and I'll put the kids to
bed and then I'll do a final check-in
and give you my final review thoughts on
everything that I tried from this
collection alright my friends we're back
it is currently about 11:25 at night you
didn't realize it it actually been seven
hours that whole time you were watching
that it's been seven hours so if you had
anything to do today I'm sorry and I did
want to show you how the makeup wore so
let's go ahead and zoom in alright so
zooming in super super close the lips
look terrible on both sides but for the
record I never would have let it get
this bad like ever in a million years
what I probably would have done would
have been an ad a gloss over top to
smooth this craziness out remember this
side as the does the color as this side
is the covergirl so let's go ahead and
add a gloss and just show you how it
might even out actually just for fun
let's go ahead and add this double
Platinum glitter I actually wore this
for whatsapp and makeup one week as like
a like a in the center of my lip and I
got a lot of compliments that week on my
lip color well I should show you right
now before I voted on it's not looking
good it's also feeling a little bit dry
on both sides which is not my personal
preference but so as you can see the
gloss really does blend everything
together and I always have a lip balm in
my pocket for liquid lipsticks or a lip
gloss to do exactly that's the only
thing you have to be careful about is
depending on the gloss it could make the
lipstick transfer outside of the lip
line if it gets a little too smooshy but
this pairing actually works really well
so let's check out everything else
that's on the face let's just start with
the complexion so we'll look at the
foundation remember covergirl side
high-end side check that out I mean to
my eyes you are very very zoomed up you
you are seeing me better that I can see
me at this point and I don't see a
difference between my two sides at this
point at least with my eyes in the
mirror the highlight is definitely still
on on both sides I think it looks really
good and like I said the complexion with
the primer is still looking really good
I don't have any weird foundation taking
into my wrinkles or anything we're
looking pretty stinking good so let's
look at the brows I feel like the brows
are pretty much the same as well and
look at the eyes though remember this is
covergirl eyeshadow on both sides but we
have got open decay and then covergirl
on this side I mean like what they look
exactly the same same with
liner the liner still looks good on both
sides which is ridiculously impressive
as far as the mascara goes I didn't get
any smudging or flaking or anything with
the covergirl mascara but it's not a
very impressive mascara overall now if
you look at the lips now that the gloss
has been on for a minute the covergirl
side looks a little bit chunkier a
little bit cakey er than the dose of
color side so there is a slight
difference between the way that they're
handling this gloss and believe it or
not if you look here at least for me I
feel like I can see a little bit more
fallout on the urban decay side then I
can on the covergirl side as far as the
eye shadow having glitter falling
through the day it seems like the
covergirl actually kept the sparkles on
my eye better than the urban decay which
is mind-blowing to me alright so let's
go ahead and zoom out for final thoughts
on each one of these products from the
line alright so let's talk about drawer
number one which was the flip open with
the video screen hello editing Jen here
so yeah we're gonna pause right now
because what ended up happening with
this part of the video is it was boring
as all get up I watched this part and I
was falling asleep and it was terrible
my whole full review part so we're going
to not bore you to tears and we're gonna
do a little voiceover with some images
of the products and I'm gonna give you
my final thoughts along with a little
bit of ingredient analysis so let's go
ahead and get started with the vitalists
go glow luminizing Lucian this product I
had a really nice experience with I love
the luminizing effect of it I loved that
it worked really well as a primer for me
the downsides of this is that the
product does include dimethicone which
can cause acne in some people also cyclo
penta siloxane is not very
environmentally friendly so if you can
wipe this off and throw it in the trash
rather than washing it directly into the
sink then that is a good thing
it also has artificial fragrance and an
ingredient called bismuth oxychloride
which is irritating for some people but
as far as positives there are some
really good humectants in here that will
help to bring moisture into your skin
and also to help your skin retain
moisture
there's
some really nice skin brightening
ingredients in here so for me this one
is a purchase now going on to the
healthy concealer this product I did not
enjoy all I did not find it to be
effective as a concealer if you want
something to be a little bit brightening
then you might enjoy this but the shade
range of this is absolutely atrocious
the fact that they call this shade right
here the deepest shade you see deep is
insulting in my opinion as far as
ingredients go a cyclopentyl siloxane
again that's the one that's not good
really very good for the environment it
also has talc in it that some people are
sensitive to so I'm at the code again
and it does have something called propyl
paraben and some people are very
sensitive to those if you're not
sensitive to propyl paraben you can
google and find out more about that a
lot of these scary things that we've
heard about parabens actually aren't
true as far as positive we do have some
skin brightening ingredients and some
humectant ingredients in here but for me
this is definitely ain't not purchase it
is not effective there is very minimal
coverage and that is not what I'm
looking for in a concealer also the
shade range is really sad moving on to
the vitalist healthy powder it only
comes in the four shades which I'm going
to show you all four here which is also
very very sad as far as negatives it
does have talc if you're sensitive
dimethicone if you're sensitive but
other than that nothing really standing
out in the ingredients to me this is a
powder that I also do not enjoy it makes
me very matte and flat I don't like the
way the finish is on my skin but if you
like that very very matte look you may
enjoy this but for me this one was a big
no moving on to the vital is healthy
glow highlighter now this is one of them
kind of still on the fence about I kind
of like it and I kind of don't like it
it's a little bit oily to the touch
which I don't really like one day I'm
gonna have to touch base with covergirl
on for this I'll put notes in the video
description is it when I googled the
ingredients for this what came up with
other covergirl products including the
healthy elixir foundation the total
teased mascara the katie-cat liner and
the outlast all-day matte finishing
powder which I thought was really really
weird because these formulas are
completely seem completely different but
yet they're in the exact same
ingredients in the exact same order for
the most part so I don't really
understand that so I'm gonna have to
check back with
covergirl on that one and I'll put notes
in the video description if I ever hear
anything back it should also be noted
that there is carmine in this product
this is gonna be a no buy for me I
wouldn't buy this I don't think that
it's worth the price I think that
there's so much better highlighters out
there and personally I'm a bigger fan of
powder highlighters anyway are they bad
no but I don't think that they're worth
the price now the look lock upsetting
mist if you know me you know I don't
like setting sprays but I can speak to
the ingredients on this I do want to let
you know that there are some nicer
ingredients further down on this but the
second ingredient this is denatured
alcohol
like many setting sprays denatured
alcohol is very very bad for your skin
it causes dryness it also messes with
how your skin replenishes itself and how
it trades over the skin cells and it's
just really really bad for the skin so I
would not recommend this setting mist or
any setting miss that that's alcohol
denatured or denatured alcohol in the
first I would say five to ten
ingredients if it's lower down not a big
deal but it's the second ingredient here
so this one's definitely a no-go next we
have something very interesting this is
the easy breezy micro-fine and define
pencil I really really like the way this
performed I found it to be just as good
as some of my high-end brow pencils and
I realized why the ingredient list is
actually extremely similar to the balmes
new for Alicia's brow pencil that I
really really liked a lot
no big ingredient concerns or benefits
in this one and it's actually a really
great deal compared to the one from the
balm so I would definitely recommend
this one I find it to be effective my
biggest critique here is the shade range
is kind of not good in the two of the
shades look almost identical and you'll
have to look here and see if you think
there's a shade that matches you but I
don't really I think the shade range
kind of sucks but if you can find your
shade and I would say definitely this is
a recommend the other brow product was
the easy breezy brow sculpt and set
pomade and it does come in four shades
as well there is that cycle pence
Aslaksen in here the dimethicone but
with you being on the brows I'm not sure
how much that's willing to affect
someone with acne but you just have to
decide whether it's right for you some
people are sensitive to talc
Leyton is in here some people don't like
it personally I have no problems with
petrolatum being in my cosmetics and I
do like this pomade I do find to be easy
to work with I like the format with a
little brow brush in there so this is
definitely something I would recommend
if you can find your shade because again
the shades are kind of in there now of
course the lid lock up eyes shadow
primer oh my gosh most amazing amazing
thing in this entire kit this thing is
so so so good for me it has been an
extremely effective eyeshadow primer for
me it's a highly recommend I have heard
from some of my subscribers that have
dry skin that it does not work well for
them so maybe people with dry lids may
have more difficulty with this for me it
has been amazing and just you know it
does have the exact same ingredients as
the Rimmel magnifies primer which Rimmel
is also owned by the same parent company
so I guess they just brought that one
over from the UK and renamed it as a
covergirl product the katie-cat
eyeshadow palettes are so so so good
I really enjoy them I love the lasting
power on them I love the blend ability
on them are they just as good as my
high-end eyeshadow palettes no but are
they close yes absolutely I think they
are definitely worth the price at $9.99
if you like those shades just so you
know they are mica and tout based there
is methylparaben and these and also
ethyl paraben there's altra Marines and
ferric ferrocyanide so these are not
lips safe and there's also carmine if
you do not like carmine in your products
that pigment is made from crushed bugs
but if none of that bothers you
both of these palettes are absolutely
fantastic I'm moving on to the get in
line liquid eyeliner another definite
recommend from me to you I love this
eyeliner I love how fine the brush is
how black the black goes on it is so
opaque and so easy to use it doesn't
really seep into my fine lines very much
it does skip a little bit over where my
lids aren't super taut but most
eyeliners do so it's not a big complaint
one thing to keep in mind as it does
have denatured alcohol as the third
ingredient so if you have dry lids keep
an eye out for irritation from the
denatured alcohol but
I couldn't find anything to complain
about it's really really great and if
you like it when I mess up in the demo
if you have trouble with this you make a
mistake it's very easy to remove and
reapply without making a huge mess which
I absolutely love
peacock flare mascara this was a
terrible mascara for me I felt like it
didn't do anything it was way way way
too dry for me also it is the exact same
formula as the Max Factor dark magic
mascara even down to the wand so if you
have tried that mascara which I believe
I was only released in the UK in winter
of 2018 if you've tried it it's the
exact same thing the only ingredient
that I found that was a little bit
little for me is it does have shellac in
it which is made from beetles so you
know just so you know that's in there
but I did not like this formula at all
neither at the regular or the waterproof
now the melting palette of liquid
lipsticks I couldn't get the ingredients
fast enough for this video but I do have
a question into covergirl about that so
I will put any notes in the video
description but as far as this liquid
lipstick I I thought it was okay it was
a little too drying for me I could
always feel kind of a film over my lips
that I did not like at all the darker
colors were definitely went on patchy in
some cases but depending on the
pigmentation of your lips you may not
see that patchiness as much as I do
so kind of matching these colors closer
to whatever your natural color is of
your lips it's probably a better idea
overall these were just okay for me
lasting power was fine but I just they
weren't comfortable enough for me so
these are gonna be a no but the Queen
collection major shade I actually really
really liked from that liquid lipstick
they are quite comfortable they are
definitely not super comfortable but
they're quite comfortable very similar
to the dose of colors formula and I
really like these a lot
these are definitely something I would
have purchased either recommend from me
to you I feel like they go on pretty
evenly except for when I get to those
colors that are so much different than
my natural lip color and then those end
up looking a little bit patchy and wonky
and funky but the shades for the most
part are very beautiful and even those
darker shades I can build up to
being more opaque but then I feel like
the formula gets heavier on my lips
which I don't like just like the other
liquid lipsticks I couldn't get a
formula on these but I will put any
notes in the video description as far as
the formula but for me these are
definitely a thumbs up so far
and finally the katie-cat lip gloss if I
had to pick any of the lip products I
would probably pick the lip glosses they
are so comfortable they are so shiny of
course they're just glosses so they're
not going to be as opaque especially
when you get further away from your
natural lip color but as you saw in the
lip swatches they really can be
extremely beautiful number one
ingredient amis is petrolatum so if you
don't like petrolatum again you want to
stay far away from these I again have no
problem with those there is propyl
paraben though so if you are sensitive
to that then you definitely want to stay
away from these
there's also carmine if you don't like
carmine you don't want those but overall
I really like the katie-cat lip glosses
and this would definitely be a purchase
for me I hope you enjoyed the voiceover
I promise you it was much better than
what you would have watched if you had
to watch me at 11:30 at night sleeping

product trust me this was much better I
