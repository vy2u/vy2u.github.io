look at the price and you're like who
legalize like who in the world would
spend that much money on a beauty tool
today's video is gonna be a little bit
different we are gonna be talking about
outrageously expensive beauty tools
where there are much less expensive
options for that particular use but the
most important thing about this video is
I'm gonna tell you my experience with
these products and whether I think it's
actually worth upgrading to the more
expensive cost one or if you can
probably just use a less expensive one
so we're gonna start with through my day
what I would normally use first and this
one's a little bit it's a beauty tool
but it's not quite a beauty tool and
this one's boring to you and you already
know this there's skip ahead down below
to each section so this one I feel like
has been very important to me and that's
why I'm mentioning it and it's my
toothbrush
so this is the new one that my husband
just bought me for Christmas but I had
one of these I lost it about a year ago
on my road trip and since then I had
been using this one here this is the
oral-b one you can just buy at the
grocery store so basically the idea
behind this is what you do is you press
this little button and it turns on
there's two different speeds and the
brushes every three months or so I
change these out now this is the thing
I've always really liked electric
toothbrushes since they first came out
but I didn't really see a difference
between getting this or this and when I
lost that my other one on my road trip I
started buying these for the entire year
well I got a check up in the beginning
of December and high dental hygienist
was like Jen's like I've never seen your
teeth look so plucky and whatever I
don't know how but where geez I don't
think she used the word plaque e but you
know what I mean like it were just
grosser than they normally are and I was
like I think I need to change my
toothbrush back I think that's the
problem because I've been using one of
these for years so very thankful to now
have this back I do think it makes a
huge difference if you aren't in the
market for one of the more expensive
ones if you just want to get one of
these again I don't think they're I
think they're better than the manual
toothbrushes the ones you just scrub
normally but I feel like this one is the
best one of the electric toothbrushes
did you come by the grocery store it's
just the oral-b one it says cross action
on the back these are really good but
it's definitely not as good as these I
definitely think this is worth the
investment that's just my opinion you
think all you want this is not a beauty
product but I feel like taking care of
your teeth is kind of a beauty product
number one with the whole breath thing
with the color of your teeth and then
also just being able to keep your teeth
through good dental hygiene so for me
this is a beauty product but let's move
on to things that are a little more
traditional we're gonna do hair products
next now the hair products I want to
show you I actually filmed before I put
my makeup on because I wanted to show
you how they work so I took a shower I
came in and I did I kind of did little
demos of these two products for you so
we're gonna get into that right now
while I was prepping to film this video
my hair dried just a little bit but this
is the hairdryer I want to show you how
it works as far as the light and
everything and how it actually blows my
hair dry so as you can see there's a
button here that you push up so there's
three lights here for the blower
strength and then there's three lights
here for the heat let me show you again
I'm going to turn it back on this here
is a cold blast of air here for people
that like to do that with their hair now
I'm going to go ahead and put on the
different I don't like to call them
diffusers I don't know what these things
are called but they're just magnetic and
you click it on like that and I prefer
to put it this way rather than this way
I don't know I feel like it blows my
hair dry better so let me just show you
how that looks and you can see it's not
terribly loud compared to most hair
dryers hopefully that's coming across
well on camera and sometimes I do
section my hair off and blow it dry but
since I'm doing this demo I'm not doing
like the whole like with the curling
brush and all that stuff so there's this
one and then there's one that's just a
little bit smaller that comes with it
and then you've got this giant diffuser
this thing is huge notice that this does
not dry my hair any faster than a
regular hair dryer I mean you know my
hair dry I think before this cost maybe
thirty dollars something like that just
like a white plastic I don't even know
what kind I don't feel like it adds any
extra shine or anything but it is cool I
mean I I honestly don't think this is
worth four hundred dollars but I like it
I can't say I don't like it I really
like it I'm gonna keep it but would I
recommend this for four hundred dollars
for me no even though I mean it feels
like when you put your hands in one of
those Dyson hand dryers that you find at
restaurants and things but on your head
and it feels good I like that it's not
very loud but do I see anything magical
happening with my hair when I use this
out
not now that we've gone over the drying
part let's go into the next product and
we're gonna stay on the hair normally I
would spend more time on actually
blowing my hair dry and it would look
better at this point but you know I did
it real quick
so now we're gonna fix it with the beach
waver okay so this one is the bigger one
that I have this one is called the S
1.25 let me show you the concept behind
it so basically what you do is there is
a fast and slow button over here on the
side I have mine always set to slow
because the fast is too fast for me and
then what you do is you can turn your
hair on to it I know it seems gimmicky
hang on with me you turn your hair with
it and then you can turn it the other
way and then once you're done you can
hit this home button and it brings it
back so that you can set it down easily
now it also has heat down here at the
bottom and it takes about I don't know
three or four minutes to heat up to the
350 degrees which is kind of its
automatic setting I used to put it on
370 but when my hair started really
fitting out I realized that 370 was too
hot I think 350 is perfect for my hair
so let me show you how I use this when
they do is I just take a section off
here and the very first piece I always
want to spin away from me so I put this
down here on the bottom and then
sometimes pieces fall out and that's
okay and then I just spin it and then I
count to six one two three four five six
and then I let it go and I have a curl
and then for the next one what I'll do
is I'll grab another piece I know I'm
not a hair person okay I'm just not I'm
not a hair person this is what I do
because this is what works for me then I
make it go the other way for the second
curl and I go like mmm and I try to get
it to kind of go up and one two three
four five six I used to take a bunch of
time to kind of hold it while it while
it was cooling which I think would be
ideal but I haven't had a problem with
this holding my curls without doing that
so I kind of abandoned that practice
but you can see what pretty curls it
makes so I'm gonna go ahead and finish
this side and I just do four sections on
each side and again alternating which
way I go one two three four five six and
then I just hit the home button so that
I can set it down and one thing though
that you have to be really careful of
that I don't like this is that when
you're pushing these buttons sometimes
you can accidentally hit the home button
and your hair starts rotating in a way
you don't want it to rotate so at that
point I immediately hit the little
clicker thing and it lets my hair go but
that scared me a couple of times
accidentally hitting this home button
when I'm trying to turn it here so I've
got one more curl on this side and then
we're gonna do the tighter curls on the
other side I let them completely cool
before I finger them through all right
I'm gonna let the other curling iron
heat up and I'll be right back so now
I've got the smaller one heat it up this
one is an s-1 this one I feel like gets
caught in my hair just a little bit more
but I'm just not hating on it I just
don't really really like it a lot
this one I've had a little bit longer
and it does the same exact thing except
it's just smaller when I first turned
this on I did look to see the
temperatures on here so we've got
between 290 Fahrenheit all the way up to
410 Fahrenheit that that's what this one
goes to alright so let me demonstrate
this once you can see the difference in
the curl and I know there's plenty of
ways that are probably much more
professional for me to section off my
hair and everything for curling but I'm
not a professional it's fine to what's
easy for me and you can see the curl is
much much tighter with this one because
ideally I should probably be taking two
pieces from the top and two pieces from
the bottom but you know I do what works
for me and this is the easiest most
functional way I don't have a mirror
here so I'm doing this without looking
one two three four five six so you can
see hopefully you'll be able to see the
curls are much tighter and I'm gonna go
ahead and do what looks like I only have
one piece left over here
I'm gonna give that a second to cool and
then I'm going to brush out my hair so
that you can see the difference between
the two sides as far as the curl goes my
hair is now completely cool so I'm just
gonna kind of finger through these and
then finger through this side and that's
how the curls look fingered out and
hopefully you can see the difference
between the sides I know I can see a
huge difference my Rowley chair is
falling backwards and I don't want to do
overall I absolutely love the beach
waver I really really really love it I
do think it is 100% worth the price for
these I've used so many different
curling irons I remember when new me was
huge on YouTube if you remember new me I
had a new me I had a bunch of other
different styling wands and curling
irons and things like that I have
seriously never had a curling iron curl
my hair the way that this thing does I
don't know what kind of magic they put
in this weather like a fairy comes by
and you know gives it some kind of
magical powers I don't know what they're
doing over at beach waiver but these
things are seriously the best curling
irons I have ever used I would love to
know your experiences with the beach
waiver down below I've never heard
anybody say anything negative about this
product the only thing I could imagine
being scary and tricky is the whole
turning thing but it does you can stop
it whenever you want it's not like the
ones that suck your hair up where it
just kind of sucks it up until it's done
sucking it up and there's not much you
can do about it so it's done this one
you can turn it off at any point you can
unclamp it at any point but it
definitely has scared me a couple of
times where I felt like my hair was kind
of stuck in it especially when I
realized that the 370 was too hot I
found my hair was sticking to the
curling iron and it really freaked me
out so I because it was burning so once
I turned it down to 350 it's been
wonderful for me those are the only and
anyway negative things but I think if
you know what you're doing with hair
stuff I feel like you're going to love
these they do have a pro version of
these I don't have the pro one did not
mean to do that I don't have the pro one
because they're I think about $200 for
the pro one I think that they're longer
so if you have lately long hair you may
want to invest in the pro one I've
personally never tried those all I can
ouch four is these two and I really
really like them a lot
alright we're gonna go ahead and zoom
out and we're gonna talk about the very
last product which is the simple human
mirror that I get asked questions about
all the time
the last product I want to show you is a
product to get asked about all the time
and if you've been in my live chats
especially if you've been there alive
you know every single weekend live chat
at least a couple people asked me about
this and this is my simple human mirror
this is a really expensive mirror it's
200 bucks and it is fabulous hate to say
it but it's really really really good
it's it's got a light as you can see and
it's got this sensor up here it
definitely has some drawbacks and the
first one I want to tell you is that it
does turn off very quickly so I'm gonna
flip this around so you can see how fast
it turns off if you're not directly in
front of the mirror I really don't like
that see it's off I've heard that some
of the models have a switch on the
bottom I don't know if that is true but
mine does not have a switch I've also
heard some extend mine does not extend I
actually tried to extend this one
because people were swearing to me it
does but then I exposed the wires inside
and realized
nope it does not extend it does charge
through a through a wall charger the
cord is very short I don't like that but
the actual function of the mirror is
stinking amazing the mirror I was using
before this had light it was like I'll
put a picture of it right here at least
one that's similar if I can't find the
exact picture but it had the lights on
the side and I felt like it lit the
mirror more than it lit my face where I
feel like this like my face is lit up
and I can see everything so well in the
magnification magnification is perfect
and I even though I know I'm not the
best at makeup I don't have to tell me
every single time I'd do something not
people always tell me you know how
terrible I make them okay I do feel like
this mirror has improved my skills very
much improved them since I was using
just the regular mirror or using that
other lit up mirror I can really see
what I'm doing but what I usually do is
I have a regular magnification no
magnification mirror also to kind of see
my face as a whole
I feel like this is really only good for
like doing detail kind of work but when
you want to start doing blush and things
like that I feel like I need a regular
and not magnified mirror for that so I
use both mirrors as I'm getting ready
usually when they always recommend if
you're looking to invest in this mirror
is check out bad Bath &amp;amp; Beyond because
they do have those 20% off coupons all
the time and you can use your 20% off
coupon on one of these if you're looking
to invest in it so for me this is a
hundred-percent game-changer definite
recommend I think it is totally worth
the 200 bucks for me personally as
someone that does makeup videos for a
living if you're just trying to get
ready for work and it doesn't really
matter like the precise application and
everything maybe you don't need it but
if you really want to get you know be
able to really see what you're doing
highly highly recommend this at this
point I want to turn the conversation
over to you if you've tried any of these
products I would love to know your
thoughts down in the comments below
because we are the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness and we work together
to make sure we are not buying crap than
we are buying things that are worth the
investment just like it with Amazon
reviews and things like that I feel like
it's important to get more than one
perspective so if you are thinking about
purchasing something that I showed today
definitely make sure you're checking out
the comments below you know just get
more than one opinion on what's
happening I love love love reading the
comments my videos because I always
learn something and if you're not
already subscribed and you're not part
of the collective brain you can do that
by clicking the subscribe button down
below and people have been telling me
they haven't been getting notified what
my videos are going live so you can
always hit that notification bell and
that gives you a little extra
possibility that they may let you know
or at least a new video hopefully you're
getting notifications I hope but if
you're not that's a way you can make
sure you get notifications when I upload
a new video and I want to thank you so
much for watching mad love to you and I
