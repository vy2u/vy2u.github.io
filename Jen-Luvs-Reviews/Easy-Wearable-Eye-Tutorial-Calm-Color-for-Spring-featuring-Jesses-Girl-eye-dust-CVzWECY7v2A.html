how many makeup tutorials i have watched
and i have to tell you that a lot of
them are low crazy for me and i like to
use some color but i don't like my color
to be insane and bright and crazy i
decided to do and I look that has color
but isn't like crazy oh my goodness this
girl's got color on her I crazy but I
want to use a color that's brand new to
me that I'm super excited about and it's
this Jesse's girl I dust um and the
color on this is kili rose and it is an
iridescent white green pink craziness
going on here you'll see it in a minute
it's really really nice this is my first
Jessie's Girl product ever and I am
loving it I also wanted to incorporate
my new to cosmetics eyeshadow that I am
in love with in a heartache it's a duo I
got this in my Ipsy bag this month which
was way better than last month let me
tell you so I'm going to do when I look
with these two so if you want to see
what that looks like keep watching okay
so here is my NYX jumbo pencil in milk
this is just a really nice way to get
kind of a whiter sheet of paper if that
makes sense they're just kind of
lightens up your skin tone a little bit
makes a nice base for if you're going to
use colors that aren't close to your
natural skin tones so since I'm going to
be using like a greenish iridescent
color and a pink I really wanted to make
sure those stood out so I use that
here's that Jessie's Girl the dust using
a brush from crown brush I really don't
like the crown brushes that much except
for this one I think this one's called
like a seed brush or something like that
most of them have a lot of shedding this
one is no exception but I really happen
to like the shape of this brush and I'm
just padding that over the inner corner
all the way to like two-thirds over my
lid I go past the center just a little
further as you can see with the Jesse
scroll powder it does go on clumpy
if you don't pad off your brush well but
it is easily blended to you know get rid
of that clumpy texture there now here
comes my to cosmetics and we use the
lighter pink now and I'm going to go to
the the middle of my eye so I'm going to
cross over the iridescent color just a
little bit to really make sure that that
transition is going to be nice once i
use my blending brush I'm just tapping
that all the way to the corner and just
kind of working it up into my crease
just a little bit now using an angled
brush I'm going to use the darker color
and just work that up into my crease and
this will just create some dimension to
the eye and make it so it doesn't look
so flat we are going to blend this later
so if it comes out too harsh don't worry
about it you just want to get that color
up into that crease and you know just
really pack it up in there so you get a
nice pop of color there and then just do
the same thing to the other side and you
can do a windshield wiper motion if that
works for you with your eye shape okay
now with that blending brush if you
don't own a blending brush it's just a
fluffy brush you gotta get one it can it
just really just can transform your I
look and I just blend it out the harsh
lines I didn't have any product on there
now I'm going to use a little black from
my naked 2 palette you can use any black
for this and I don't want you to be
scared to use in black black is really
just a way to create a shadow on your
eye and when you put it on that outer
corner you can really make a huge
difference in your eye look now it looks
a little crazy right now but I'm going
to blend it and you'll see the
difference that it makes so you just
make like a harsh V in that corner and
then you just circle around that
blending brush and see how it turns into
just more like a shadow like a grey
shadow rather than black so don't be
afraid to use black you do want to make
sure you use a high-quality black so
that when you do blend it doesn't just
completely disappear now this color is
used to use any color that's a little
lighter than your natural skin tone just
to highlight that brow bone here's the
the eyeliner this is a liquid eyeliner
by elf I really like this went just as
much as my Urban Decay liner to be
completely and totally honest both of
them I really have to work on my fine
lines and
Corner they see I had some speed bumps i
had to fill in as i went across but and
and if you're you're new to using liquid
eyeliner one thing you can do under the
sound silly to practice is to trace just
just fine you know your kids coloring
book or you know an old coloring book of
yours and trace
now that was the Urban Decay liner in
zero love that for the waterline and
then this is the Rimmel scandaleyes in
nude that I love someone had asked me
how to use this and it's as easy as this
just to brighten up your waterline the
top one is really good if you have a
little bit darker skin too and than I do
now that's how it looks so far and now
I'm putting on a little bit of mascara
this is the they're real mascara by
benefit but of course you can use
whatever your favorite mascara is
and there's about a look in case you
were wondering on my lips I have a NYX
butter gloss and this one is an apple
strudel it's like the I know where they
come up with the names cuz apples are
not a coral to me but it's a coral a
kind of color and i love these NYX
butter glosses if you haven't gotten any
of these you should totally go out and
get them if you want a gloss with a
really nice pop of color these are
us alright so that was the I look I hope
you enjoyed that mad love to you and I
will see you in the next video
