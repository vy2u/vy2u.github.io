you a new ball it's not new subscription
a new subscription for me the wonderful
people at eco Emmy contact me and asked
me if I would like to do a review of
their subscription box and of course
never try to go at me before so of
course I am apt told me yes yeah I don't
know exactly when i get i know that my
friend Jennifer at inspired mom 824 does
eco Emmy I've watched some of her video
so I have kind of an idea of what it
might be but I don't know what is in
this particular box I'm excited to see
so a little bit about ego Emmy it is
fifteen dollars a month and i believe it
is lifestyle kinds of things so let's go
ahead and see what is inside okay so as
soon as i open it i see some pretty
paper spring colors oh that's cute so
you open up the paper and then it's got
a little card here and it says thank you
so much for taking the time to review
our box we hope that you enjoy all the
goodies inside for any questions feel
free to contact it up contact us the Eco
Emmy teams that was very nice them to
include a little handwritten note very
cute eco Emmys mission is to offer our
customer the opportunity to embrace a
healthier eco-friendly lifestyle leading
to a greener planet for everyone that's
cool and then it's got some information
about the company very nice on this is
the februari februari box there you go
and it's got all the products on the
back one two three four five six seven
and different products that's a lot of
products so let's see what we've got
alright good light natural candles
paraffin free I didn't know paraffin was
bad that's good to know I'm assuming
it's bad do you guys know why it's bad
I'll have to look that up it's six
unscented tea lights I can always use
tea lights it's nice for the evening
time just light a little a couple of tea
lights in the bed and the kitchen or in
the living rooms kind of give it a nice
relaxed feel I what kind of wish they
were scented just because I'm a big
scented kind of person but roasted
garlic hummus dip by wild garden very
interesting now i am not a fan of hummus
dip but my my five-year-old almost six
year old loves thomas dip my husband
also loves it so i'll be passing this on
to them and it says ready to eat so i
guess you just cut it open squeeze it on
whatever it is you're eating it
with and you're done so that's kind of
cool it's chickpeas sesame paste water
seesaw natural roasted garlic natural
spices citric acid so not a lot of
preservatives in here which is nice well
no preservatives in here which is great
there's no whenever I see ingredients
that look like this it's like oh ho I
don't want to put that in my body so if
it's really nice it's a very very short
list of ingredients fantast this is
interesting chocolate paste with vanilla
I can see myself I am totally going to
open this I'm gonna do it right now
because I have this I have to do it I'm
a huge chocolate fan if you did not know
that you know that now chocolate is like
my thing I can't get it up and it's got
a little easy chair thing there we go
okay you're opening this and we are
going to eat it chocolate paste I can
imagine this would be nice on like bread
or something but I'm just going to eat
it mmm-hmm I want to taste like like a
little bit more chocolatey than Nutella
mmm but it says low glycemic index
that's kind of cool what's in here Oh
hazelnut that's why organic roasted
hazelnut Venezuelan heirloom cacao creo
yo I'm Creole Creole oh I'm on organic
coconut sugar coconut sugar never heard
of coconut sugar organic vanilla powder
organic gentian powder I'm gonna save
the rest of this but I had to taste it
because chocolate addict hello how many
of y'all are chocolate addict so you
guys chocolate looks like i am totally
so next I got this little pouch here
this cute little of yellow bag with
white polka dots and see what's in here
this is new style organic hair spray and
I'm actually starting to run out of my
garnier fructis hairspray that I've had
for years so I can definitely use a
small bottle i don't use hairspray that
often so this will be nice and i'm
curious to try and organic hair spray
very interesting i didn't know you could
have organic harris breaks i thought it
was pretty much all chemicals but we
shall see looking forward to trying that
let me smell it ooh that's got a organic
smell to it um it's not eucalyptus
definitely eucalypt but I will
definitely be trying that cold okay next
I have this little purple somebody
and to put this in this and I think
that's so sweetly that they hand wrap
this stuff ok this is lash conditioner
needs eyelash conditioner by Lauren
Brooke cosmetics maybe with vitamins
herbs and extract that will help feed
and protect your lashes gently use a /
conditioner at night after washing off
your mascara leave on for 20 minutes or
throughout the night if desired use
three times per week to promote longer
healthier lashes yes I need that in my
life and I love that it's organic that's
really cool here is another little to be
too and this is I'll lip love me some
lip balm this is a vegan nutrient-dense
lip conditioner my family is slightly
obsessed with lip balm I'll insert a
picture here of our lip balm collection
slightly obsessed but I have to say it's
mostly my husband it's not me but this
will go in the collection it's a winter
mint flavor it smells like um is that
Wrigley's the the winter mint gum not
the one not spearmint doesn't smell like
a pep it smells like um like those after
dinner mints that you get at restaurants
and stuff that are like the softer mint
flavor not the sharp like candy Kaden
flavor smells really good very anxious
to try that and this is by Jersey Shore
son very nice and then this is the last
thing and this is a lavish recovery beta
glucan mask by by Osama I am NOT
personally very into masks but I'm
trying to get into it I just don't have
the patience for them doesn't have a
very strong smell just kind of smells
like a hand lotion but curious to try
that very excited about that so overall
I'm really actually very happy with this
subscription I'm surprised at how much
of it I am really into looking at I just
wasn't sure what was gonna happen with
this when I wasn't sure if I was gonna
like it I wasn't sure if it was gonna be
a rave review I definitely I mean I'm
not like oh my gosh this is the best box
ever but I am really happy to try
everything in the spots I don't know I
think that it's going to be another one
that's personal preference whether you'd
be interested in trying these types of
products or not III think that I am I
don't see anything in here that
I am NOT happy about not excited about
where I'm like oh that's terrible I
don't even like that uh um so yeah
definitely cool well thank you so much
