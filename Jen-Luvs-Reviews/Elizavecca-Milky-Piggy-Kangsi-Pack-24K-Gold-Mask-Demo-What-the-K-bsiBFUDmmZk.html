the K where we set that creepy Proximus
ID whether it is worth your time and
money today we are testing out the cons
EPAct
Eliza Becca milky piggy facemask and
there's a pig on it and he's got a hat
and there's some gold dripping turning
into some crazy faces let's test this
out one of the reasons why I bought this
face mask is because it had amazing
reviews on Amazon it is a legit seller
on Amazon it comes right from Eliza
Becca I hope I'm saying that right comes
right from them so I know it's a legit
product but it has four and a half stars
and 132 ratings I thought that was
pretty good so I wanted to try it and
see for myself
whether this was a good product or not I
paid $11 and 95 cents for this but for
right now on Amazon it is 11 dollars and
70 cents it's also available at a
website called style Korean which I'm
not familiar with but you may be
familiar it was thirteen dollars and
eight cents there I'll link both sellers
down below I'll read you their
description it says it has special
ingredients 24 karat gold improved skin
elasticity pore tightening and removes
toxins from your skin moisturizes and
nourishes the skin brightens up and
softens the skin you recommend it for
all skin types but especially good for
oily skin and large pores so one of the
magical things about this is it is a
color change product so 24 karat gold
color turns white in 20 minutes it
cleans your pores removes dead skin
cells dirt and toxins minimizes pores
firm your skin refines texture and helps
your skin look more soft and radiant in
order to use this it says to apply a
great sized amount of the kongzi pack
and an even layer all over the face
while gently massaging into the skin
leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and
then wash it off with warm water so of
course being me I had to do angry the
analysis to see what in the world is in
this and whether it sounds legit or not
so the number one ingredient in this is
water followed by silicon silica is
going to give you kind of that slip the
next ingredient is alcohol
because usually when a prophet has
alcohol limit they mean denatured
alcohol which is not good for the skin
there are some alcohols like fetal
alcohol that are that you have some skin
benefits to them but but denatured
alcohol is not one of them I find that
if it is a good alcohol they usually
label it and if it's not they usually
don't so I'm inclined to think that this
was denatured alcohol so that's a third
ingredient in here the fourth ingredient
is actually sugar which is kind of weird
to make because I knew I couldn't find
any skin benefits to sugar being applied
to the face but I could be wrong there
maybe I just didn't look deep enough
glycerine is the next ingredient which
is actually a skin replenishing
ingredient that's a good one then
polyvinyl alcohol which is a thickening
agent next one is kind of blah kind of
made me go it's called cyclo penta
siloxane and this is one that is not
harmful to humans but it is harmful to
sea life it tends to be by you
accumulative in the water so usually
when something have sexual types of
siloxane in it I usually tell people
don't wash it off but because it's a
mask you kind of have to wash it off so
what I'm going to do today is I'm going
to wet my face with water and I'm going
to wipe it off with a towel and then
wash the rest off trying to get as much
onto the towel as possible
so that I don't get decycle pencil
siloxane down the sink next ingredient
is a thickener and then we go into the
kitchen sink like every single herb and
spice all kinds of stuff in that so the
next ingredient is lavender extract now
lather extract has some positives and
some negatives to it it is a fragrance
which of course a lot of people are not
able to handle fragrances they don't
trust fragrances they don't like
fragrances but they do say that some of
the benefits may be may be acne treating
eczema detoxifying properties and toning
properties but there's strong evidence
to suggest that this is a skin
sensitizer
just be really careful with using a lot
of lavender oils on your face and on
your skin in general it's just not a
great ingredient overall even though it
may have some benefits to go along with
it it may not be worth the skin
sensitizing stuff the next one is a
rosemary leaf extract which has to have
a calming effect on the skin but it just
like lavender it can be a sensitizer
to the skin
go into the pantry and we get all of the
herb extracts so the first herb extract
after that is oregano extract and we
have time mac wa berry acai raspberry
blueberry bill berry cranberry and then
we have bee propolis which I personally
really like as an ingredient just a
really fun interesting greeting with a
lot of good benefits licorice root and
green purslane and then we have
hydrolyzed collagen but this is way way
way down on the list
adenosine I think I'm saying that right
is a skin conditioning anti-aging
ceramide 3 also skin conditioning and
then we get the gold way down there we
get the gold now there I can still can't
find any legit research that says gold
is good for your skin so personally at
this point I think gold is hokey I don't
think that it's a good ingredient
there's got to be other good ingredients
in it so the gold I don't really care
about there's a texture modifier some
colorants and some fragrance so the big
message here with ingredients is if you
are sensitive to fragrances please do
not buy this product there's way too
many fragrances in here you're concerned
about fragrance stay far away also if
you're concerned about alcohol stay far
away let me smell it now that we're
talking about fragrance it does have a
very strong florally sweet kind of scent
and as you can see coming out here is a
gold color but it's a very strong strong
scent so if you don't like to smell
strong scents on your face you also want
to pass on this so that's it for my
research breakdown let's go ahead and
apply this I'm going to put on my face
mask headband that I forgot that I had
and this is from a company called balms
beyond I got this at generation beauty
and I forgot that I had it and I found
it I was kind of cleaning things out
after my declutter this morning because
it's Sunday in my time and I found this
Aliki yeah I can use it for what the K
and it's cute we've got these little
ears on and everything so and I'll keep
my hair out of being mask so I'm going
to apply this everywhere except for I'm
not going to get it close to my eyes I'm
not going to put it on my lips and I am
going to use this tool to spread it I
actually got this as a serum applicator
with the product but I like to use it
with mass
because it doesn't absorb products
rather than like brushes like this the
flat brushes I feel like they absorb too
much product so I don't use those I like
this one better my idea of a great side
of the mount is about that I'm just
going to kind of plop it all over put a
little more my forehead very strong
scent and I'm going to spread it out
with my tool I'm going to use a little
bit more right now it just feels mildly
sticky but it's not unbearable I'm going
to use a little bit more I don't think I
have enough and I want to move quickly I
don't want it to start drawing I can
already feel strong I should have turned
my my fan off to right now it's already
starting to change to white Oh go Jed go
go Jen go go go go
I want to get my nose pores alright
alright we're going to start drying now
just feels a little cold and still a
little bit wet
all right we're one minute in and it
feels very tight on my skin all right
two minutes in how am I looking not
completely dry yet
get in there though just a little bit
more over there
all right we're three minutes in how we
looking Phil's a little wet still in the
wet spot yep still a little bit wet over
there so I got white Santa Claus beard
all over me and I can't smile my face
feels very stiff all right four minutes
in so a little bit of drawing needs to
be done just a little bit more I want to
check my email I can't just sit here is
boring mm-hmm all right we're five
minutes in and I cannot move my face but
we are completely dry at five minutes in
I just realized I didn't put enough
right here but we'll still be able to
get the impression of it so I'm going to
go ahead and leave this on for 15 more
minutes and I'll be right back I'm going
to try really hard not to crack my face
don't smile dead don't smile don't do it
we are now at the 20 minute mark and I
officially cannot express myself so I'm
going to go wet my face and wipe this
mask off and I will be right back so
that I can speak like a functional human
okay
my face is cleansed I'm going to go
ahead and pull this off whoo okay so so
right now my face feels like it's been
cleansed it feels kind of like I want to
put a moisturizer on like it feels a
little bit dry so I
don't know if I would recommend this for
dry skin just because of the way my skin
feels right now it doesn't feel great I
have normal skin which as a reviewer is
a blessing and a curse because I can't
really review skin care fully for people
that have problem skin because I don't
have problem skin I can just kind of
give you my impression and there's
nothing I can do about that and I'm
really sorry that I don't have more
problems skin as far as wiping off the
product I did want to mention it was
very easy to wipe off I just splash the
water on my face
and then took the towel and wipes it off
super easy after I felt like most of the
product was on the towel I washed the
rest of it off of my face to try to keep
that cycle pimple siloxane out of the
out of the drain so that was not a
problem actually I kind of preferred
that then the first time that I did it
before I realized I was like LaPenta
siloxane and I did use this one other
time and it was kind of difficult to
wash off completely so you may just want
to use a towel for just the speed of it
it was a lot faster doing it that way so
of course with any skin care you kind of
have to use it for a while to see if
you're going to see any results I've
only used this twice so I can't really
speak to any long-term results of this
but looking at the ingredients I can say
I'm not very impressed especially if you
have dry skin and you're sensitive to
products with alcohol if it dries out
your skin you definitely want to stay
away from this if you have oily skin
enlarged pores like they recommend
you're probably the best candidate for
this product but for me I'm just I'm not
really impressed with the with the
ingredients in it I mean the only things
I'm impressed with are the hydrolyzed
collagen the adenosine or however we
said it as denison i don't know how to
say it the ceramide sorry the bee
propolis the but there are so far down
underneath all this other stuff I mean
the water the silica the alcohol the
sugar like why oh and the glycerin is
and other good things so I mean I really
don't see this as being ingredient why
super beneficial to the skin that's not
to say that it isn't beneficial to the
skin because I'm not a cosmetic chemist
I don't know how much of these
ingredients are in here so but for me
this is kind of a mediocre product I
mean it
kind of fun to do and I really like the
the way that it changed from gold to
white I mean that was kind of gimmicky
and cute the packaging is gimmicky and
cute but is it a stellar product that I
think you should go out and buy no I
definitely like I said I think that if
you have oily skin and large pores this
is probably maybe more likely something
for you to try but for me I feel like
it's not really worth it for me I'll
probably pass this along to someone who
I think might enjoy it more than me
because I probably won't do it again be
completely honest I have other skincare
and masks and things that I like better
than this but I'm really happy that I
tried it so a lot of thank you so much
