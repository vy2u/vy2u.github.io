questions lately on cruelty free what it
means to be cruelty free I am a my
cruelty free if I do this but I don't do
this and all these questions and
misconceptions about cruelty free and
the difference between vegan and cruelty
there's so many questions I am NOT an
expert on cruelty free so I brought
someone in that is an expert on cruelty
free this is Courtney also known as
Phoenix on YouTube she also has a
cruelty free blog I'm gonna be
interviewing her today for you to answer
a million questions about cruelty free I
don't think you're gonna have any
cruelty free questions after this is
over so if that sounds great to you hang
tight we're getting into it right now hi
Courtney how are you I am great and I am
excited to talk to you about this
because I do feel like at least in the
comment sections of my videos there's so
many questions about cruelty free and
people getting upset about things
because of confusion and I feel like
there's no better person to answer these
questions than you thank you I'm so I'm
really happy to be here to talk about
free with you well we all we really
appreciate it as a community that you're
taking time out of your day to talk with
us so if you don't know Courtney she
does have a youtube channel called fear
at NYX and I will be linking that down
below for you so you can go ahead and
check it out she also has a blog that I
will also link down below and just puts
out really good quality of makeup
reviews and videos on cruelty free
makeup and I think you'll really really
love her along with her expertise her
review skills are fantastic
so I definitely check her out if you're
not already subscribed so the first
thing I wanted to ask you is just kind
of look at getting to know you question
of how did you pick the name fear NYX
for your channel
well actually fear is the name of my
role-playing character
I used to play this drow elf character
in D&amp;amp;D and she just kind of stuck with
me like whenever I would play online in
a lo which are massively multiplayer
online games I would use the name Farah
or I would be spear Nix if like Farah
was taken so she just kind of stuck with
me for a long time nice thanks so cool I
actually used to play Dungeons and
Dragons as a teenager I was in the
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Club in middle school
so fun fact so tell me a little bit
about the kind of content that you put
on your blog
oh so with my blog I pretty much talked
about cruelty free beauty I talked about
hooded eye makeup and like tips and
tricks for that because I have hooded
eyes you can't tell today because I put
my contours rx lid correcting strips in
my eyes which basically kind of like hi
into the hood and then I also talked
about pale girl like Foundation and
makeup like tips and tricks just because
it can be sometimes difficult to find
foundations that match my skin tone I
gotta give a shout out to eat in
minerals who make my favorite foundation
Nordic veil and the shade you're on but
pretty much I talk about comfy beauty
sometimes I talk about lifestyle stuff
with my dogs I've got some awesome dogs
they're scared of poodles I have Phaedra
and NYX NYX is named for the goddess of
the night so they're pretty cute haze
I'm sure that a lot of people would
really enjoy that content definitely
thank you for sharing that so let's go
ahead and get into the cruelty-free
topic and I think the most important way
to start this off is just to define
cruelty free and what it means so can
you do that for us sure so if something
is cruelty free what it means is that it
was not tested on animals at any part of
the process so like the raw ingredients
weren't tested on animals the product
itself wasn't tested on animals like
nowhere in the process is it tested
there wasn't any third-party testing
that's what cruelty-free means and the
reason that it gets kind of complicated
in the u.s. is because in the u.s. there
is no legal definition of cruelty free
so because of that there can be a lot of
confusion gotcha
so what um some people get confused
between like for example carmine as an
ingredient people had my comments get
very upset when a brand says that
they're cruelty-free but yet they
included ingredient like carmine which
is made from those boiled crushed bugs
so can you explain why
wit that would include something like
carmine would be could be cruelty-free
so that's actually a really good
question I guess because people have
used carmine which is like you said it's
crushed bugs that's really gross as an
ingredient for hundreds of years people
don't consider that to be an issue and
that gets into in my opinion the
difference between cruelty-free and
vegan so if a product is vegan that
means there are no animal ingredients at
all that means there's no carmine
there's no silk there's no honey no
lanolin nothing that comes from an
animal doesn't matter if it's an animal
by-product if it's there it's not vegan
that's where I see a lot of confusion
that because people are like well it's
you know it has animal products so it
can't be cruelty-free it it's like well
it's not exactly the case so if a
product is vegan and it hasn't and it
has nothing made from animals it's not
tested on animals it's actually truly
vegan but there can be some confusion
with labeling because some companies
will say that a product is under percent
vegan but they still test some animals
so that's why it gets really complicated
at least here in the US Wow so an animal
a bug can actually die for the product
and it will still be called cruelty-free
correct yeah I think that's really
confusing to some people I think some it
that really blows people's mind
it does and did you know like just be
clear I'm not vegan but I don't know if
you know this but carmine is also like
one of the things that's used I think to
color Marcin or cherries and stuff like
that like it's used as like a food
ingredient too so yeah absolutely what
did I hear that it's in some kind of
candy I heard that they use carmine and
a candy I can't remember which one
though so one thing I mentioned in my
videos quite often is the different
levels of Cruelty freeness it can there
be different levels of cruelty free
different it can be cruelty free and you
know believe one thing and someone else
be cruelty free and believe something
else
absolutely in my opinion everybody is at
a different stage in their cruelty-free
journey that's one reason
that item judge I don't shame but there
are some people who feel that
cruelty-free means to them that it's all
companies that say they're cruelty-free
some people feel that it's cruelty-free
only if their parent company doesn't
test on animals so for example they
would not consider Lauria or they would
not consider urban decay to be cruelty
free because they are owned by l'oreal
l'oreal is not a cruelty-free company
currently there are people who only
consider it seems to be cruelty-free if
they're 100% vegan as we discussed that
means no animal products at all so
there's like all of these different
levels of cruelty-free hmm ok so what
are some popular cruelty-free brands
that are mainstream brands that people
might want to check out ok so my
favourite popular mainstream culture
through brands would be like Urban Decay
Too Faced
it cosmetics becca cosmetics hourglass
wet-and-wild Physicians Formula NYX NYX
is another one there's also like bare
minerals by beauty cover effects there's
actually a lot of cruelty-free brands
that you can find at Sephora and Ulta is
there a good resource that people can
use to find all of these cruelty-free
brands absolutely I obviously I keep a
full t3 list on my blog I have the date
that I update that page listed on them
on the blog so you can see whenever I
last updated it I also highly recommend
checking out my friend Jen from my
Beauty bunny and my friend Tichina from
logical harmony the three of us email a
couple times a week to discuss new
brands to see to share information to
say this is what the brand told me what
did they tell you we try to make our
cruelty-free lists match as closely as
possible they don't match 100% but we
try our best to get them to be very
close just so that there's less
confusion out there for our readers that
is awesome that you collaborate with
them on that and kind of have a united
front to make sure that you're
presenting the best information possible
that's amazing I also highly recommend
leaping bunny but not every brand is
going to be leaping bunny certified
because it's a special certification
process and they do have a they do
charge a one-time fee some brands are
okay with that some brands aren't a lot
of brands use PETA but I
they don't trust Pete it because
sometimes Peter will have brands on the
list that are testing on animals and I'm
just like okay oh wait wait wait okay we
got we got to talk about this now all
right this was a question later but now
we got to talk about this so you're
telling me that if there is a PETA Bunny
on the package it may not be cruelty
free so people can put anything they
want on packaging in the USA
there's no because there's no legal
definition of cruelty free so France for
example batiste has a a vegan thing on
it and it has a bunny and it says not
tested and animals or whatever but they
still test on animals right now so why
yeah like that really upset me because I
used to buy the Tisa's my dry shampoo I
thought they were awesome and then when
I found that out if I emailed them I
called them on the phone and they said
all this stuff but I'm like oh okay well
I'm no longer gonna buy your brand what
never will really confuse an example for
this is Laurie Elle's ever pure line or
ever fresh line whatever that whole line
the ever line is it says 100% vegan on
the packaging but that line like while
it may not have any animal ingredients
it's still owned by L'Oreal and they
still do tests on animals currently in
China
so actually I may rephrase they don't
test themselves but the government tests
their products if that makes sense
there's like a really confusing
distinction there so yeah I know it's
really really hard for people to
understand that just because they see
the bunny it may not be cruelty-free but
that really is the truth that's one of
the things I talk about in my video on
my five tips on how to go cruelty free
is that you have to learn to think
critically you have to you know take it
into your own hands to reach out to a
brand and ask questions or you have to
refer to sources that you can trust and
we already talked about a few of those
sources so that's great that they'll
have that you know everyone has that as
a resource now to check the cruelty-free
status because chances are you or one of
the other blogs have reached out to the
brand before and found out this
information absolutely awesome yeah I
ran into that same problem with the
crayon case where they're and they're an
anti brand and they had the PETA Bunny
on their eyes shadow palette but they
weren't listed on pitas website anywhere
and I tried to reach out to them and ask
them about their cruelty-free status and
they never respond
along with a few other questions that I
had one of my subscribers tried to reach
out to them on Instagram and they
basically it sounded that they were kind
of writing me off as someone who was
just being negative and kind of being a
hater instead of someone who genuinely
wanted to know the answers to questions
I had a bunch of concerns they're called
what's in the video description of that
video but that was one of them was that
they had the PETA Bunny on there but now
I know even if they were listed on pitas
website that still doesn't mean they're
cruelty free so how did they get away
with that like if they're if they're not
cruelty free but still PETA gives them
the bunny how does that work so the way
that works is that PETA is a really
large organization and I think they have
too many people doing things so they
don't they don't they don't verify the
information they don't check they
basically just ask the brand are you
cruelty free and if the brand says yes
they're like great we're gonna give you
our certification they don't bother to
check to see well do you test your
ingredients on animals does anybody test
for you is there third-party testing
going on do you sell in China where
there's mandatory testing in certain
places they don't do any of this like
background check stuff Wow
you know that that's that's why that I
personally don't trust Peters list when
I first got into cruelty free I was like
Oh Peters awesome yeah and then when I
started learning more about that I'm
like oh they're really not that good so
if somebody wants to start with PETA I'm
not gonna dissuade them because it is a
started plate place it's a it's a
starting point but I really kind of try
to push them towards leaping bunny
because I feel like leaping bunny is a
better place and then if they're really
receptive I you know I tell them to
check out my blog or tichina's or Jenn's
and go from there because I feel like
you know the three of us put a lot of
work into our lists right right so you
feel like the leaping bunny if you saw
that that would give me a good solid
indication that it truly is cruelty free
absolutely there's also a bunny for
Australia I can't remember what they
call it but that bunny is a pretty good
bunny too because they're they're
cruelty free brand is much more reliable
than PETA okay that's good to know I'm
that's that surprises me so I'm really
glad that you're clarifying that because
that bad surprises me I did not know
that
no one solo I want cruelty-free - you
know I'm with cruelty-free in 2012 and
then I was like oh there's so much stuff
out here it's really confusing and then
I met Jen and Jen helped me and she
explained everything to me so that kind
of like you know pushed me along then I
met Tichina and then like the three of
us just started talking all the time so
it's kind of cool and Jen owns which
website and Jen owns my baby bunny calm
okay got it Tichina owns logic or
harmony net okay
awesome very cool so I've noticed a lot
and maybe you've noticed this to you
you're of course know more about this
than I do that a lot of indie brands are
cruelty free it seems to be more indie
brands than mainstream brands that are
cruelty free why do you think that is
and then also what are some of your
favorite indie cruelty free brands yeah
absolutely and I think that comes down
to the fact that because indeed indie
brands are small brands they're able to
control every step of their process
they're able to control who they buy
their ingredients from so they can make
sure they're buying from cruelty free
ingredient suppliers and you know
they're not gonna pay the big companies
to do testing or anything like that it's
just not in their budget it's not
something they think about and most of
them are animal lovers that at least the
ones that I know personally so it's just
not something they would ever do so you
know when I look at indie brands that I
love that are cruelty free I think about
things like or I think about brands like
sugar pills
Farren a darling girl
silk naturals Emma Diane Kitty shimmer
they make my favorite nail polish pretty
serious and I'm sure I'm gonna forget
some but like that you know those are
some of the ones that I use a lot of my
blog nice and it's funny cuz a lot of
those are brands that I've never
personally tried I've tried a lot of
indie brands but I haven't tried most of
those so now I've got like making my
mental list right now of brands that I
want to try now so thank you for that
and I think that you know in a land
where YouTube is so saturated with
products as PR the nd brands aren't
really you know they don't have the
budget to send out so much PR so a
channel like yours is going to give
viewers a different experience because
you're you're reviewing these products
that aren't necessarily reviewed other
places which i think is awesome so it's
kind of a happy byproduct of what you do
yeah every time I talk about
either like or my pretty zombie they're
two of my favorite I forgot to mention
them the two my favorite indie brands
and they do a lot of like duochrome
colors people love those because there's
such unusual colors you can't just walk
into Sephora and find colors like that
yeah and I feel like a lot of times
indie brands are more creative overall
as far as the product offerings and what
they're you know the things they're
putting together and the concepts and
the ideas just seems so fresh and
different where I feel like a lot of
mainstream brands stay in that comfort
mass-market zone yeah the warm smoky
tones all the time mm-hmm
and the Browns and the neutrals and now
all the warm Browns are everywhere
everywhere yes definitely so another
question I get asked all the time is if
my product is made in China
if it says PRC People's Republic of
China or if it says Made in China that
it is automatically tested on animals
can you kind of explain how China works
as far as animal testing and how to kind
of decide whether something is cruelty
free or not if it was made in China yes
okay so the China issue is extremely
complex a product can be made in China
and say like PRC and sold in the US and
still be cruelty-free an example of that
would be the brand tart I know that
they're you know a controversial brand
right now but they often that will make
pallets and such in China and then sell
them here but they were they are still
cruelty free you can make products in
China and sell them in a province like
Hong Kong and they can be cruelty free
because Hong Kong is exempt from animal
testing there are other provinces in
China now that are exempt from animal
testing as well there's some other ways
to get around US companies
testing on animals in China is to do
what mute sticks did if you're familiar
with the brand new sticks they're sold
at Sephora and Ulta and I had a FaceTime
actually with Jenny Frankel the founder
of the company and she explained how she
was able to create a company in a
specific province of China that had all
of the approved ingredients for their
products to then create like a nude
sticks China company so she could sell
and still be cruelty free in China and
very complicated expensive process that
that's how she's doing it I have heard
that other brands get around the issue
by using cadavers for testing them stead
of animals yeah that's human cadavers I
mean it's so like there's there's ways
the different companies avoid animal
testing in China and I've heard also
heard that some brands will just bribe
the Chinese government because I think
it's very clear or I think it's a very
important distinction that this is all
the Chinese government having
regulations in place to protect their
people they're not doing this to be
cruel to animals and I think a lot of
times when the China issue comes up
people kind of come off as racist or
maybe that's I think they definitely
don't seem to understand and it's not
your average person in China who wants
this the average person in China just
wants to be safe you know they want to
be able to buy a product and not have a
problem they and they did have problems
a lot of problems several years ago so
that's kind of where this you know
what's going on in like if you want more
detailed information on this subject
because it has been changing especially
in the past six months I strongly
recommend going to tichina's blog
logical harmony and she has a couple
posts that are really detailed on this
issue but in short you can have
something made in China and sell it in
the US and it can be cruelty free and
that's where you're at so to add on to
that so I'm good with that as far as if
something says PRC it can be cruelty
free but if a us-based company sells in
China that's typically considered not
cruelty free is that correct
or is that changing that is correct and
less like they're doing something
special like nude sticks or there's just
only selling in Hong Kong because what
happens right now is that Chinese based
beauty brands are like exempt from most
testing but American ones are not but
the testing that goes on is post market
testing which is where they'll just go
pull products from a shelf so it's kind
of like spotty that's why
some companies like Mac Mac is Mac was
know under cruelty-free in 2012 that was
actually the catalyst to me going
cruelty-free on my lawn was Mac starting
to sell in China so Mac OS says they're
trying to make change from within but I
haven't seen them do anything about that
but their products will be tested you
know just randomly from the shelves so
it's not like the brand themselves are
doing the testing so that's why they try
to say they're cruelty-free and that's
actually what happens a lot like a lot
of like if you go to the makeup show or
other beauty industry of events and you
talk to people they won't have any idea
on whether or not the brand is cruelty
free because they're tight while it is
because of these issues you know they
they don't test in the US so that's all
that matters and so it gets really
confusing for people I don't know if I
can answer that okay yeah no no
definitely and then I did notice I did
want to touch on L'Oreal a bit because I
did notice that
L'Oreal does have that cruelty free
statement on their website I'll read it
to you because I do have a note here it
says L'Oreal does not test any of its
products or any of its ingredients on
animals and has been at the forefront of
alternative methods for over thirty
years yeah I know that L'Oreal is one of
those brands that is notoriously known
for not being cruelty-free yet they have
that statement there so that kind of
ties into what you're just saying is
there and like so L'Oreal is not cruelty
free because they test and they send
their products to China and then people
in China randomly pick products off the
market and then they test those on
animals is that's what's happening here
yes yeah and the L'Oreal is actually
really interesting in a special case and
I have some facts I want to share with
you I have my notes so I'm gonna grab my
notes because I started researching like
how can L'Oreal say this and realize
that some of what they said is true
while they are still you know testing on
animals in China because it's a
government thing they don't test in the
US and they actually started developing
alternatives to animal testing in 1978
1979 they started buying up companies
that
they had anything to do with like up you
skin and like bioprinting to create like
a safer means of testing for human what
is that
what's epi skin what is that so I guess
like in 97 every skin was developed by
this company called bio Maru
it's a French name so I'm probably
butchering it and L'Oreal bottle company
to start working on developing epi skin
kits for testing products and so since
1997 they've continued to buy up all
different kinds of companies that had
anything to do with this particular area
of alternative means of testing so that
they could try to push to the forefront
in this field okay so it's like fake
skin basically it is fake skin that's
exactly what it is so you know what a
lot of companies like pay lip service
like Max and say that they're doing
things to try to you know get rid of
testing from within I've never seen
anything from Mac on the subject but
from L'Oreal I have actually seen proof
because there are all kinds of articles
that can send you links to the Articles
that you can look at where they talk
about this EPI skin and how they're
developing it and how it's used and how
it's actually more effective and more
accurate for testing products than
testing on animals that's the thing I
think really stands out that is so
interesting so L'Oreal is a big player
in that so people that are cruelty free
that probably wouldn't change their mind
about L'Oreal I would imagine but
hopefully the the advancements that
L'Oreal is trying to make will help the
world go cruelty free so yeah I have a
lot of respect for L'Oreal and what
they're doing with epi skin and I do
think it's gonna change the world that
yeah I hope so I definitely hope so
that's that's awesome so I know that I
have some viewers that are really
interested in going cruelty-free but
they're hesitant for one reason or
another how does somebody start
beginning to go cruelty free like do
they have to throw away all of their
makeup that's not cruelty free in order
to be a cruelty free consumer absolutely
not
I believe in baby steps do it all
gradually so don't throw away things
that you've already spent money on
bought that's just wasteful you're just
going to be putting
in a landfill I think it's better to
basically you know whenever you use up a
product start researching what the
cruelty-free alternative is to that
product and really what I did is I made
a list of all of my brands that were
cruelty free and all of my brands that
were not quilty free so that I could try
to find replacements for those brands
yes so if somebody is let's say they
want to go cruelty free but then they're
not like they're not vegetarian they're
not vegan but they want to go cruelty
free can can someone be not vegetarian
and not vegan and still want to go
cruelty free or is that kind of an
oxymoron contradiction I think it's
absolutely absolutely fine I am NOT
vegetarian or vegan I dated a vegan for
five years but I think every little bit
helps I I basically have I guess what
you would call a harm reduction this
mindset so try to do the least amount of
harm possible so if you can be
vegetarian or vegan that's great but not
everybody can there's a lot of health
reasons why some people cannot be
vegetarian or vegan so you know you
should do whatever is best for you but
if you can try to be cruelty-free that's
great if you can only be 50% cruelty
free that will make a difference every
little bit helps it's kind of like with
some stuff with the environment and
recycling and stuff like that every
little bit does add up so and actually
I've heard recently I think it was an
article that I read that they were
talking about the drugstore makeup has
been really losing a lot of money
recently that they the sales for
drugstore makeup has gone down
significantly especially from mainstream
brands like covergirl Maybelline L'Oreal
brains brands like that and I think I
must have mentioned it in my makeup news
show what's a good makeup or something
because I remember seeing comments like
well if they would just go cruelty free
they would get so much more money they
wouldn't have to worry about people not
buying it anymore so it's definitely
possible definitely possible that that
the cruelty free movement really is
making an impact I do think that's the
case I also think that some of the other
drugstore brands have really stepped up
their game like Physicians Formula went
wild and NYX like those three brands to
me from the drugstore they they kill it
they've been
done a lot of great products and I think
that that's part of why perhaps those
other brands aren't doing quite as well
mmm yeah definitely I think so too and
do you know if makeup revolution is
cruelty free yes they are as that's
another one that I see that's doing
really well as far as people
recommending their products saying that
the products are very very good in
comparison with other drugstore brands
so it might just be a quality increase
as well in those cruelty-free brands
just doing the makeup right and doing it
well so people are more likely to
purchase it it could also be that more
people are buying indie brands too
because indie brands are more in line
with drugstore pricey but then you're
getting department-store
quality for the price yeah and that's an
excellent point as well I totally agree
with that absolutely
the one thing you would mention to me as
a question you get a lot is about
medication and medication not being
cruelty free so I did want to touch on
it since this is you know cruelty free
kind of catch-all for a lot of questions
so they tell me about medication and
cruelty free not cruelty free so in my
opinion you should always listen to your
doctor and you should take your
medication because medication to live is
a necessity makeup is a luxury that's
five for me I'm you know I choose to buy
cruelty-free makeup because it's a
luxury product I don't consider medicine
to be a luxury I consider you know like
the medication I take for my anxiety I
take it daily I consider that a
necessity I consider you know my friends
who take insulin for diabetes that's a
necessity like it's stuff that you
absolutely need so you should always
take your medication and you should not
in my opinion worry about that but if
that is a concern for you there's a
company that I donate or a non-profit or
whatever that I donate money to call the
Physicians Committee for Responsible
medicine and they look into alternative
means of testing as far as medicine goes
but that's only if that's a concern for
you like I said
I think that basically being multi free
with your makeup has anything to do with
being you know with trying to be cruelty
free with your medication I don't think
you should try to be my cruelty free
with your medication I think you should
take whatever your doctor says you need
to take right unless your doctor can
give you an alternative are cruelty free
maybe a generic version or another
version and it's something you can
financially afford because you know
medications can be outrageously priced
but I totally agree with you that your
health is the number one thing and
living I mean we're talking about
insulin and things like that I mean this
is this is your entire life and now I'm
with you I totally totally with you on
that one so one more thing and this is
one that I've actually wondered myself
because though being an ingredient
junkie and someone that looks into
ingredients and things you know like for
example like talc Mike you know at the
hexyl palmitate which is a preservative
used in cosmetics all of these very very
common ingredients probably at one point
were tested on animals at some point
even in leaping bunny certified cruelty
free makeup at some point in their
history we're probably tested on animals
so it's anything ever really truly
cruelty free in that way like how do we
you know why does it even is there a why
does it matter now kind of thing that
goes along with that I mean I personally
still do believe that it matters but I
want to hear your take on that for the
person that maybe doesn't think that it
matters because at one point all
ingredients were probably tested on
animals at some point yeah absolutely
at one point every single ingredient
including water were tested on animals
but in my opinion just because they were
all tested on animals at one point in
time doesn't mean that we need to be
testing on animals today I do think it
makes a difference you know like I
mentioned there are alternative means to
animal testing the idea of you skin that
are actually way more accurate at
testing whether or not a human is going
to have a reaction or not one of the
studies I was reading and I I'm trying
to remember what they said the stat
statistics were that like the animal
testing would be like 70% accurate and
whether or not there would be a reaction
versus like 97 percent with the EPI skin
so that's why I personally think that
going more towards using human skin for
tech like the EPI skin for testing as
opposed to animal testing is way better
because you like well then text sorry
that's kind of like a separate issue
that's tied in with this I would also
like to point out that all of those
ingredients that have been tested like
there's a long list of improved
ingredients that have been proven to be
safe for humans now for like 50 or 60
years that most companies will choose to
use for their products and I just I
don't know it matters to me I guess
that's what it comes down to yeah and I
think also like to kind of add on to
that is that the the animals that are
being tested on right now they care you
know they definitely care about whether
you know things are being tested on them
right now whether the ingredient was
tested a long time ago or not but I have
I have to admit I have had that thought
in my head like is anything ever really
cruelty free not that cruelty free
doesn't have a point because of it but
you know because these things have been
tested for so many years is anything
really truly cruelty free in that way
and all that would be cruelty free I
guess would be a new ingredient that was
just invented but how many of those are
there at this point I don't know well I
know another thing that comes up is that
people are always like well you know if
I can't be hundred percent cruelty free
why should I bother the thing I tell
them is that it's not possible to live
in a hundred percent cruelty free world
right now unless you like give up your
phone your laptop and just go live in
the woods and take care of yourself like
that's pretty much it like what's our
modern society you know the iPad if your
computer or your phone your camera like
there's always gonna be exploitation
somewhere down the line so that's why I
believe that you know trying to do the
minimal like that harm reduction mindset
of trying to do the minimal amount of
damage that you can is a really good
mindset to be in I love that I love that
and especially comparing it to like
recycling or something you know that you
know I may recycle at my own home
because I have a recycling program but
if I'm at a restaurant
you know what maybe like a fast-food
restaurant and I've got my trash oh
there's no recycling there do I take the
stuff in the bag bring it home to
recycle it or do I just throw it in the
trash at the restaurants you know I mean
I think any bit of help with your
recycling at home or recycling wherever
you can it definitely does helps I
thinking thinking about cruelty free in
that that harm mindset of doing as
little harm as possible I think is a
really interesting perspective and I
really think that that's a good
perspective to have and you have to
decide for yourself what you can do for
your own personal life absolutely yeah
