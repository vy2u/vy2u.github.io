I got a lot of comments on some of my
other videos of people saying that they
were afraid of eyeliner that they didn't
know how to put on eyeliner they didn't
know what was up with eyeliner so I
thought it would make a video kind of
explaining the basics of eyeliner
they're basically five different ways
you can do eyeliner and there are good
versions of drug store and high ends
both so I'm going to show you a little
bit of both mostly high-end but that
doesn't mean there isn't good drugstore
just happen to have a lot of high-end
eyeliner and I'll show you now the
different brands that I'm using for the
pencil eyeliner I'm going to be using
the Urban Decay 24-7 in 0 I'm also going
to be using for eyeshadow I'm going to
be using the black from my naked 2
palette but really any black eyeshadow
will do for aligning your eyes as long
as it is a highly pigmented shadow such
as a l'oreal infallible or a wet and
wild from the palette shadow um for the
marker eyeliner I'm going to be using my
Kat Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper
love this thing and for my liquid liner
I'm going to be using the elf black
adjust regular playing professional
liquid I think it's called professional
I know this shape elf liquid eyeliner is
wonderful and I'm going to be using my
new mic a beauty gel liner that I just
got in my empty bag because it's my
brand new favorite and it's awesome so
but there are some problems that happen
when I try to apply this the way i will
show you because of these hot lights
around me so i'll talk to about that in
a minute now here we go with the five
ways to apply eyeliner alright so this
is the Urban Decay 24-7 on pencil and I
like I found with other pencil liners
you're not really going to get a nice
crisp line with a pencil liner which is
why I don't think it's necessarily the
best liner to use if you're brand new
with eyeliner
I think that's a mistake a lot of people
make it ends up kind of looking like a
crayon a lot of times like this one does
and it's a little bit messy to work with
the point isn't particularly very fun so
it's a little bit more difficult to
apply one thing pencil liners do do very
well at is bottom lash line into the
water line if you see how easily that
applied to the bottom line if you're
looking for a bottom line liner then a
pencil might be what you're looking for
depending on the pencil liner sometimes
it does run down so you really want to
get one that works with your particular
water line here is eyeshadow application
as eyeliner using a angled liner brush
you're going to get a similar look to
the pencil but as you can see it's a
finer application because of the way
that the brush is sheets you're going to
get a more exact line than you would
with a pencil in my opinion so if you
want like a soft a softer line Oh smoke
your line maybe even a more casual line
eyeshadow might be the way that you want
to go applying to the bottom waterline
is kind of hit or miss depending on
which shadow you use this is an urban
decay shadow it applies pretty well to
the bottom lash line but it's not going
to be a dramatic bottom line so if you
want something a little softer a little
more subtle for your bottom lash line
eyeshadow might be a good application
for you as you can see I did get some in
my eye though if that bothers you
getting a little bit of powder in your
eye then it might not be the right
application for you just because that's
a little bit uncomfortable to get powder
in your eye I personally don't care I
just blink it out and it goes away and
i'm happy and fine but you might not be
okay with that like i am now going in
with a liquid liner this is the elf
liquid liner you get a nice point there
and it's very wet looking this is going
to be more of us for a dramatic look in
my opinion it works really nicely for
one of those cat eye looks as you can
see I got some speed bumps over on the
side to have to color those in if your
eyelids are quite taught like mine are
the biggest drawback to a liquid liner
is that you have it sometimes it's hard
to control how much liquid is on your
little brush there so you it can get
globby it can
messy and that's one of the biggest
complaints about liquid liner and it
being difficult to apply is the glob
unis that you can get and if you get
globs eyeliner man you are in some
trouble because especially if you've got
a waterproof one gettin it off I me is
such a stinking pain so if you're new at
eyeliner and you want that glossy look
I'm going to show you another way to
kind of get that effect in a second now
here going on to the bottom lashes I
never use a liquid liner for my bottom
lashes because it always gets stuck on
my actual lashes and makes a huge mess
so the only reason why I'm showing you
this is to kind of show you the mess
that it will make at least when I try to
apply it maybe some of you have better
ways of applying liquid to the bottom
lash but it really makes a mess when I
try to do it I did get it to apply a
little bit especially like you know just
trying to move around my lower lashes
and it just is really difficult I drew
on my eyeball I mean it just is not fun
you see it's getting down below mine on
my lower lid it's just messy and not fun
at all now here if you want a glossy ER
like more crisp look a pen eyeliner
might be best for you I've had some bad
luck with its some pen liner seeping
into my fine lines some of them work
better than others just going to have to
play around with it to find one that you
like milani liquefied against Milan ease
liquefy have heard really good things
about for this and this one is the kat
von d and you can see how crisp of a
line how much control I have one thing I
really like about a marker liner versus
a liquid liner is that you don't have to
worry about how much is on your brush
it's automatically the perfect amount
there for you to use and you can really
get exact and get right into that inner
tear duct if you want to going into the
bottom lash line again I have a lot of
trouble getting the liquid the excuse me
the marker liners to apply to my
waterline they just really like to stick
to my lashes and make a big huge mess so
you can kind of see how that's happening
to me I don't normally do this maybe if
I practice more of get better at it but
it really does not do a good job on the
bottom lashes in my opinion you can see
on that other side I really did get it
dark but still I mean it does it's
really messy I'm not a big fan of that
at all now here is my favorite way to
apply a liner and that's a gel liner
this is my new one that I got my epsy
Dagda michael liner but it's see it's
really easy to apply because you've got
that brush there with the control with
that fine line you can thicken it
however you like do have those speed
bumps there again that I got a color in
now going into the other side you can
see it kind of seeping into my fine
lines there a little bit that's because
of the lights that I'm under I've never
seen this liner do that before I think
it was just getting hot from being in my
handing on to the light so I'm fixing it
by wiping it off gently with my finger
and then I'm going to just kind of
refill it in to kind of make it look
more crisp but yeah that doesn't
typically happen I think it's just
because this liner is just so pigmented
so don't take that to heart that this is
happening with this liner now down to
the bottom waterline usually this really
applies nicely and I think again I think
it was the heat it just wasn't working
for me so if you live in a high heat
climate area maybe a gel liner might not
be right for you or you might have to
play around with different formulas from
different brands but yeah it was just
being a complete mess and I doesn't
usually do that it usually applies
pretty nicely my waterline so I think
depending on the formula you might have
better luck with water line application
with a gel liner oh my goodness look at
that hot mess there I really had to rub
to get it off to you because this stuff
dries really fast and it's so pigmented
it's just craziness you just want to
really be careful with a gel liner and
just making sure not to make a mess with
it if you're in a higher climate but if
you're not in a regular typical
temperature room it really does apply
nicely and fine with most of the gel
liners that I've tried and there's the
final look of the gel liner I think it
looks really nice this is actually my
favorite
