filming space today do you recognize it
or is this new to you if it's if it's
new to you then you have never met this
lovely lady and I don't know how that
happened but this is Emilie Noel 83 I
this is my second and then the Travel
Club series if you haven't seen the
first one that was with Stephanie Nicola
I will link that down below and Emily is
here to play a game with us and we're
gonna go ahead and get started with that
right now so if you do not know why
Emily is significant in my personal life
and in my personal channel Emily is has
been my youtube idol since the beginning
of my channel I when I first started
this YouTube channel I was watching two
channels I was watching Emily and I was
watching Marlena from makeup geek when
she was doing like tutorials in her room
and all of that so this is a huge deal
for me and if you've been following my
channel for a while you know this and
I'm going to not cry I'm going to be
saying this is a happy happy happy right
now this is this is a big deal for me so
thank you Emily for doing this room with
me I really appreciate it this is a huge
deal for me as well I mean I am so
honored that Jen like takes an interest
in my channel has been it's so
supportive of everything I've done and
that she wanted to come here I mean
heart of gold from a person who wants to
come to Southern Illinois get on a plane
rent a car come down here and do this
and is excited to do it like that just
that makes my world so thank you so much
Jen we had a wonderful dinner last night
by the way ate some barbeque just had a
good time
drink beer got all excited yes yeah it
was fun tell you what we're gonna be
doing today so this is a game that I
made up and Emily is the one that
created I shadow palette bingo and you
know they kind of wanted to play off of
that so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna be playing legit bingo
with eyeshadows I'm gonna go ahead and
show you our bingo cards right now emily
has the low numbers I have the
numbers and we've got an actual bingo
roller and we're going some kid numbers
and then whoever's number gets picked we
have to apply that eye shadow in some
way whenever way we choose and we can't
stop until someone gets bingo so we're
gonna be removing the shadows as we go
and yeah I think it's gonna be a lot of
fun and we both tried very hard to make
our boards not super easy we threw some
tricks in there for ourselves so that we
would have a challenge and so that would
be a little more fun so we all we did
was you know warm neutrals right C are
not neutrals but warm natural shades
then that would not be a challenge so
yeah it's gonna be interesting yeah I'm
so pumped for this this was a great idea
and Jen made these boards by the way so
I said she's going to have like a little
separate side class on how to set up
your own makeup video this is really
neat and this would be some fun you can
do with your girlfriends on or
boyfriends and girlfriends aren't
boyfriends on a you know Saturday night
and you set up the Bing of words and
just play together I think that would be
a lot of fun so here we go we've got it
don't want already fell out that's
cheating all right let's put it back in
all right you ready okay first one I'll
roll with the first one and then okay
there we go so we got Oh 65 which is
mine I think I know do I have over 65
jobs to type under the Oh 65 you have
those 65 I have o 65 do where is it it
is oh right here okay so right yeah how
people what I came up with yeah I have
an infallible paint shadow and the shade
is called brass knuckles so a neutral
but a fun neutral and shiny neutral so
we're already going metallic in some way
or another go ahead and run why did you
what take that one yeah under the eye 25

got an 44 under the end higher like a
special bingo car I do have that one so

ray so that's Jen's first that's my
first one okay okay
in the 33 Oh green I got a greenish kind
of color a murky green this is from NYX
and it is jaded so they have this line
of like really shiny sort of foiled and
we're gonna have to use every shadow
that we've pulled use everyone in the
look alright I got I twenty eight I have
I 20 oh I got in Glocks 355 a nice matte
cream that's gonna be useful it's gonna
be useful but we're gonna have to kind
of differentiate between these because
they're of the same kind of tone very
very light blue that's nice nope I
thirty I have my thirty again I got
black oh man dark matter I know I got
I'm getting lucky here because there's
some crazy stuff on the board I got I
got I got dark matter by a bit of depth
uh melt cosmetics control only and from
the rough stack that's it that's a good
one to have no g56 g50 oh my goodness
they're all one that I have we got to
get you getting some okay so I got
bitten and this is by makeup geek I love
that once is a good that is a great
shape our he's going to go together
that's the question I guess I can see
that I can see that huh hopefully I'll
be able to see it we gotta get you you
only have two so we got to get you some
more okay and if you have more people
and you're playing this and you can have
more everybody should be getting
something on each one yeah just two of
us some of them we're not gonna have
right and you can print bingo boards
offline you don't have to make them you
can just print them you don't have to be
crafty to make this work I just was
trying to be extra fancy oh man am i 21
I hope you have I guess I think you have
a 21 and a 21 nope 20 no me no all right
okay okay it's okay
right I always roll it the wrong way
Oh 61 oh right here
amber rush amber rush baby yes everybody
loves this shade yes I'm pretty sure yes
I don't know anybody that doesn't love
amber rush if you don't love em brush or
if you do love amber rush you have to
let us know in the comments because I
know it's one of my favorite now I have
three metallic there they all have it
like a really shiny metallic yeah so I'm
needing something deep and matte yes
that'll be good
n35 you're the three five and thirty
five oh okay
it's frosty yeah frostbite from NYX so
very light very shimmery I mean it could
be a highlight yeah it's so quickly
onion or some water yeah it's got maybe
a hint blue okay Nomad yeah g-57 Jim if
he said that I am G 57 and it's another
one from the milk stack and this is
unseen another perfect met I'm scared
that we're running out of these like
safe shades we've got some neon pink
over there that could be possible it's
just waiting
this was waiting staring at me saying
I'm coming okay g15 ina okay IG 59 again
okay I got from Brule by makeup geek
this wasn't rigged I don't know by the
way twelve dollars on Amazon
okay Oh 63 I think I was yeah you do
yeah all right I wanted this it's a blue
it's from Kat Von D and it is paranoid
it's gonna snow again I still have
nothing bad though yes but your colors
are much more creative so it's gonna be
envelope for sure b13
which is another one of mine and oh my
gosh another buck some silk sheets so
you know like that has a little shimmer
a little bit does so she not only has a
light shape she has a matte or shimmer
option now I know this is I'm getting
very lucky but you gotta use them all I
realize yes don't have to use them all
b14 I have that one too what it's oh
yeah okay and I'm getting closer to
bingo here a little bit okay so we've
got bronze bod by buxom well that's
pretty it's really beautiful
ah very nice kind of like dirty coppers
yeah love yeah it's very pretty like a
dirty penny I'm a big buck some
eyeshadow fan and I don't I don't show
them a lot on the channel just because I
feel like they're really expensive from
what they are and you can't put them in
with a Z palette or anything they're not
magnetic so you have to really get one
of their palettes and you it's kind of
weird not to fill it so I don't know
it's just not my favorite format but the
products themselves a really good and I
have a couple of those but I didn't
think to I didn't think to pull them as
singles for this for we got a runaway
runaway right in thirty-one
you have thirty-one oh my gosh another
fun shade okay I got another Kat Von D
metal crush and Iggy look at that that's
gorgeous okay so so far I've got like a
couple green blue bronzy color eyeshadow
on my nose yeah I it's my nose with the
finger that I had you know you're good
you're good yeah just making sure
oh by the way I didn't introduce you to
my new hair Iook since this is my
channel I would
introduce you to my new hair I want to
introduce people tonight your hair on my
channel yes oh okay cool what I want to
do the name because it costs as much as
a pet so I figure if it costs as much as
a pet that I shouldn't give it a proper
name so if you have any ideas what I
should name my halo extensions that
would be fabulous we don't get any
really good suggestions we'll just name
it bingo
how about b3 that's you all right
where's money man
no no I swear I have some on my thing
but this is an Ulta shadow this shade is
called hopeless romantic it's kind of
like a dusty mauve it is a pretty I
always think of you in these moles yeah
I enjoy those shapes very much we got B
5 B 5 okay l'oreal infallible single in
golden emerald i think this might have
been a limited-edition shade it's maybe
one of my favorites from this whole line
that's really pretty really good three
greens to work with you okay I'm sure
you'll figure out a way I'm really
hoping I get the 11 cuz it's flashing
lights by coloured raine and that's what
my favorite shadow is right now it's
literally not literally figuratively
tinfoil over your eyes time will
appreciate yes it's not literally at all
Pacific peeve is when things are
literally fingers crossed let's see I
wish in my heart for fleshy likes my
color drained okay now it's how do I fit
it in with the rest of their shadows
that's okay okay I 16 nope oh wait no
you have AI 16 I have now nine shades
and nothing man this is space cowboy
from Urban Decay yes hopper yeah yeah
it's kind of you know sheer glittery
sheen so I was I was really needing some
glitter she hope
yeah okay Oh 73 which is mine as well
and then we've got short game and this
is color brain area pretty it's got a
nice little line of that in it it's
really pretty like I am liking the
little like palette so to speak that's
coming together yes only one that's like
I'm really not sure what to do with is
this it doesn't really go with the rest
of them but we'll see we'll see how it
goes I'll figure it out work it out okay
I have g50 now okay okay okay this is
sugar from wet and wild
um this is kind of like I mean it's got
a little shimmer and its Telos okay okay
I was hoping it was in that way but it's
perhaps the least shimmery of what I
have so there you go there you go okay
how are we close to bingo yet I mean I
need one more and then it looks like I
need two more as my closest okay so
we're just gonna keep going okay we've
got n 34 I have it it is from a way and
it's caviar it is kind of a bit of a
charcoal cut pillar I 27 I have that one
I had a song on any of my scary ones yet
which I totally feel like almost fourth
I know there's other colors yes we've
got a glitter factor by buxom there you
go I wish I brought some more it's
called the one factor over there doctor
yeah it's it's like a peachy shimmery
goodness there's a little bit of a gold
again and I think that'll fit I think it
will too I'm waiting to get a purple
runner all out
I better not think that because last
time I thought something it came true in
37 this is so fun Oh
okay and 32 I got that okay I got the
and I didn't get a signal
did I am I fooling myself here okay I
did pick some matte shades I had okay
all your matte shapes that was crazy but
this is hard candy it's soft and sultry
I'm not sure if they still sell these
but it's like they're infallible
knockoff how they sold them in two packs
okay so it does look a lot like an
infallible yes okay so now we get to
apply okay so we'll see how it goes and
see what we can do can i use i preffer
yeah is it allowed yes I brought my
primer as well yeah I heard that I
bought actually got from covergirl
recently I have a big covergirl review
coming and this was actually one of the
things I really liked and I was shocked
no I never tried that I had that but I
haven't it's it's the lid lock up by
covergirl and it's very rare that I like
a drugstore price I'm not very rare like
I like the Milani I do not like the
either gun I like the one from
Ulta the older one is very nice but
other than that I haven't been able to
find a drugstore eye primer and this is
actually really good I put a
head-to-head with my Urban Decay primer
potion and it holds pretty well too the
Urban Decay as far as performance before
review coming on that whole line when I
do lip swatches of I'm gonna go swatches
up the whole line that they said so that
goes excellent
Syrian using the Milani yes I'm using my
body and what's the rule for going about
applying these is it we should just no
willy-nilly no in the end but we have to
use them all and so how many shadows did
you end up with 11 I got 12 okay so
that's pretty even yeah but we both have
a lot that's a lot to work into yes it
is one look and I because I'm traveling
I only brought three brushes so that's
going to be adding to my challenge and I
am going to try really hard emily has
offered to let me borrow brushes if I
need them I'm gonna try really hard not
to take her up on that it
if I get in really desperate she's a
glutton for punishment sighs I think I'm
gonna start with will put in glutes 355
all over the lid just to kind of bring
everything to one tone I think the
challenge for me is obviously going to
be taking these shimmery shades and
being able to create some sort of
contrast getting a look that's not
entirely muddy and maybe picking out the
least shimmery thing that I have to kind
of go in my crease so I think what I
will start out with is my way I shadow
and caviar here so it's a little bit
charcoal and um you know you you can use
shades that have a little sheen in your
crease and still make them work you know
if they're not like just shot from the
rooftop mess shouting from the rooftops
metallic you can do it that looks
sensible Jen okay good now I have to
plot my next move okay I think my next
move is gonna be creme brulee from
makeup geek as like just like a
transitioning okay crease color the
pressure is on to do my makeup in front
of Emily oh god even though she is like
the least judgmental person I think I've
ever met I'm still like I want to
impress her and you all know how honest
I am so I'm going to use throw that out
there oh I think this is gonna be this
is gonna be a challenge for us both yeah
I think big way I'm gonna take a little
bit of my infallible paints and this is
a powder shadow by the way and but
infallible paints in brass knuckles and
I'm gonna just go a little above my
crease area with this and I wish that I
had I'm going to stick with my I'm gonna
use my three brushes cuz that's my fault
that's on me I wish I had a little bit
I'm a blending brush for this but we're
gonna dip into the unseen by melt
cosmetics and try to kind of pack that
into the crease to kind of get a
gradient between the two sets it's a
little deeper than the last one I use
I'm not sure if I've ever done a look
with like this many eyeshadows yeah well
what was it people were using having to
use the entire palette that was a
challenge for a little while where
people had okay well the colors in the
palette no figure it out and then I
think it was my friend Christie from
Robbie to Christie that she did like a
huge like Natasha to Nona palette or
something she did like a but palette
that had a ridiculous amount of shades
like if she can do that that's a huge
challenge in it it was a huge okay I'm
gonna take this wet and wild single that
is in sugar and it's fairly you know
it's got a little sheen to it and I'll
just use that as my highlight just set
in the stage here and I figure we always
like layer them too you do not certainly
have to have them all completely
separate you can mix them together good
point
we're gonna try to define just again a
little bit more with bitten by makeup
geek I'm gonna just really try to
concentrate that in the outer corner
having trouble deciding like what is
gonna be my standout spot light shade
here because I've got so I've got so
many candidates Jen I know and you've
got so many beautiful colors I got but
you know a lot of more natural looking
colors I think my game plan is gonna be
because I've got three greens I'm gonna
work in a greenish lid and my lower
lashline pop will be my blue here at
least somewhere on my lower lashline
I'll work in that cuz you know
everybody's everybody's doing like blue
lid pops these days you know what oh
yeah okay mix Frostbite super duper like
the epitome of frosty white that's gonna
start going around my inner corner I'm
trying to thank doing because I've got
these guys that are gonna be kind of
contrary to the warmth that I've got
with the rest of the look something
about maybe doing these on the lower
lash line with the black as like
obviously kind of do with some contrast
but I'm a little nervous about that
because I think that might bring too
much attention to the contrast of it
yeah so I don't know I don't know I know
I'm sorry
as I said it out loud now I'm thinking
that maybe that's not the best plan
we're gonna see why should one of them
like oh yeah the corner just like kind
of oh yeah I know he went up look I got
it okay this is what we'll do we're
gonna cheat a lot sheet but we're gonna
use this as a brow highlight and then
hope it kind of just blends in with the
rest of it because it's blue so it's
like but it's kind of got this frosting
us to it oh no that was a bad mistake
wait I have to do it I have to keep
going
commit okay I'm Janice committing wait
I'm gonna put it on the other side but
I'm gonna say this doesn't count I'm
gonna have to use it another way because
this is not it's too blue okay that
didn't work I'm gonna put that on hold
for a minute actually I'm gonna try to
cover up what I just did with a little
bit of the cream I apologize if I've
been covering my face at times with my
oh no that's good it's okay I'm trying
to come up for air I'm like packing this
cream shade on with my fingertip just to
like or do we get that because I don't
want that bluish oh because that did not
look cute I'm not a fan of that choice
if you're coming over from Anneliese
channel I make a lot of mistakes
whenever I do tutorial not to Edoras but
more like demos of products I always
leave them in because I feel like the
struggle is real especially when you're
trying to learn new products oh sure are
new techniques and I think it's kind of
fun to see different mistakes that
people make and ways that they fix them
yeah because if I think everyone gets an
that doesn't matter your skill level
everybody makes mistakes
yeah it's fun to see for me how people
fix those and it's easy to get set in
the thought that okay I'm doing like a
three step or a three shadow eye shadow
look it's gonna be this this and this
and so many times you have to kind of go
back in
more this and it's figuring that out for
yourself regardless of what somebody
else's matters might be it's really
important oh I totally agree totally
agree and I love you it's almost purple
in your inner corner yeah that shade I
was not sure what was going on it looks
just white kind of when you glance at it
yeah that's really pretty thank you
it'll go nicely with the blue all right
so we're gonna hold off on those on the
the ones that don't match really and
we'll go in with let's do this one right
here oh let's do shortcake bicolor drain
and hopefully kind of set down the lid a
little bit going I'm gonna bring in my
first of three greens and this is jaded
from Nicks
so this has shimmer it's it's sort of a
murky green my other two are a little
more pure I think and kind of what I
would call like an emerald green so I'm
just gonna go really light with this I'm
just gonna have to have it right in here
it's a little bit murky but I'm gonna
need to overlap I think some with a
little bit brighter shade and some of
these singles I mean you talk about
neglected Jen like I don't know about
you but did some of these kind of get
overlooked oh absolutely and you know
when whenever I review pallets a lot of
times I'm talking about
oh it's is it a complete pallet can you
use it on its own like how I need to
pull anything but I think when I get in
that mindset I neglect the singles when
the singles are perfectly good and will
pair really nicely with a pallet yeah
okay now we're bringing in a really
exciting shade this is Iggy from Kat Von
D so these shimmers are just buttery
wonderful and this is going to be kind
of overlapping where I put that little
bit of muddy green from NYX I'm gonna
add some of this on and then now I'm
gonna go into the buxom glitz factor and
put it that from the center to the inner
corner your look is really going there I
love it I thank you and it's that it's
the bitten shade too that's looking so
cool with that peach it's pulling it
it's point it does it's surprising to me
because
it's such a deep you know sultry kind of
shade with that fun pop with the
shortcake it's it's gonna be really cool
and I'm enjoying it my big strategy was
to stay with what I'm familiar with
which is like the whole cat eye look is
what I can do
so I'm trying to stick with that as much
as possible instead of doing something
crazy like some kind of halo eye or
something and it's working pretty well
and I got really lucky with the shades
that I pulled to them yeah you've got a
great assortment but if I mess this up
and that is it's mine to lose here mine
to loose maybe I should have been coming
up like this a little bit more often so
you can see the look better but um I've
packed the Kat Von D shade right there
kind of center of the lid and now I'm
gonna move outward with some of my
L'Oreal green which is golden emerald
and I think it's it's actually a pretty
close shade to what I've just used bit
deeper a little more olive I think
doesn't gonna bring it all together
that's really pretty alright and I'm
gonna go into bronze / buxom and really
concentrate that on the outer corner
again just a you know kind of top over
that's the dirty penny yes the dirty
patting kind of pair those together a
little bit a little closer she's gonna
say this is coming together beautifully
that that inner corner is pairing with
the green a beautiful isn't it a while
it's gorgeous I never would have thought
to do that I don't know if you guys can
see it as well if it's translating as
much on camera but that light shade from
NYX is downright like lilac II kind of
around the inner corner it's fun and
this whole thing is fun like this is a
great idea and I think people sometimes
lose the fun I mean you get into if
you're going to work everyday it's kind
of like the grind of putting on makeup
or even if you do YouTube videos like
they're people kind of get get lost in
you know I need to do this video on this
day and it just it should be fun
absolutely totally agree I'm just kind
of gonna wing this out just a little bit
in the outer corner what's very bit
listen I'm working with the box out that
wrongs debod yeah yeah
anyone okay but I'm definitely going to
need to blend it because oh but I
totally feel like I just covered up the
prettiness that was Ben I think I I must
have I covered it up so we're gonna have
to bring that back a little bit hey
there's no rule saying you can't bring a
shadow in that's true you bring them
more than once
absolutely so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of this and lay it kind of
closer into my crease and kind of bring
it above a little bit just to make sure
it doesn't get lost so here's where I'm
at with kind of that greenish lid and
I'm working in a little bit of that
charcoal because it's really the only
dark shade like yeah really the only
dark shade that I have and I'm gonna use
that with a smallish crease brush
because I like my control and I'm just
kind of yeah you know I'm watching -
this is just so fun to see this in
person like freaking out right now let
me go ahead and get a little closer show
you kind of where I'm at at this point I
think it's going pretty well
alright I'm just gonna kind of brighten
the brow bone just a little bit and
blend this cuz I think it got a little
harsh up here the funny thing was like I
mean Jen she opened the door to be like
insanely challenged with some of the
covet like lime green there's a really
cool pink over there because you imagine
if I had out of purple into this how
that would have worked her at a lime
green that would have totally thrown the
look but then she did that little trick
where she asked for a certain shade and
then it popped out okay so we're gonna
do a little bit of this one I haven't
used silk sheets yet by buxom and I'm
gonna just gonna I'm gonna put that in
the inner corner but still on the lid
cuz I want to reserve the actual inner
corner for those silver shades okay I'm
gonna work in my Ulta single here in
hopeless romantic this is a pretty this
is a pretty quality shade if you're into
those kind of I don't know what I'd call
it like a light ice
mom you know that's that's kind of what
this is old that brand has some hidden
gems here in there you just got to like
take the time to explore because
sometimes when you get into Ulta that
line just seems so massive it's like
where would I even yeah I think that
upsets me about Ulta is that they
discontinued things very quickly they
they roll through their products are
they screaming out with things that are
like the new innovative interesting
things and one thing disappear pretty
quickly which is very frustrating to me
because I'll buy something get really
excited about it and by the time I bring
it to the channel it's already gone and
it's not really you can't keep up yeah
all right I'm going back into the glitz
factor by bucks and just trying to blend
it with the shade that I just did
because I feel like I lost that a little
bit I'm going back and forth and I'm
also gonna try to re intensify a shade
here from it's my Kat Von D green that I
used cuz now I've kind of built you know
that darkness around the eye so I think
I give it up good no you're doing great
thank you thank you okay so I think I'm
going to try and we'll put this one in
the inner corner the lacy chic this one
I had to have something that was a
little bit of a challenge and we're just
gonna pop that right in the inner corner
just right there
they say blues any tone of blue can
really be super flattering for a
brown-eyed person like you know your
babies and your but you're a little bit
more like are you borderline hazel yep I
didn't used to be it's really weird I
feel like my eyes are getting lighter as
I get older is that thing you know I get
later as they get older I deserve a feel
like they are though and then I think I
will take my space cowboy from urban
decay if you're not familiar with this
shade this is like it's see that light
machine it just looks like a glaze
almost and it can be really cool when
you top like a cream shadow where it can
really adhere I don't love just like
playing with it on its own so much but
I'm just gonna like dab it with my
finger basically center of the lid okay
so I think I only have two shades left
that I
haven't used and it's the black and the
flashing lights and I'm gonna top
flashing lights over top of the mat I
don't know if that's cheating but you
know you got an overlap bag it's got it
overlapping nothing light our eyes are
only so big people right okay look what
I did it looks gorgeous oh my gosh it's
gorgeous
it's perfect and now I'm max actually
decluttered that she okay well that came
out very bright what did you do I put
the flash on yeah you were right that's
a serious anything let me swatch it
since you're not getting like the full
power on the lid it's crazy yeah that
that's about as intense as I've ever
seen a silver I mean it's ridiculous
ridiculous what brand did you say
someone colored regular drink
mmm-hmm so I just got the black left woh
saat it down
all this magnetic stuff mmm I've got a
blue this my name is your boy and so
lower lashline nice lower lashline very
smart very smart okay I'm going to I
think I'm gonna start with lower
lashline and see where this goes I'm
thinking about bringing it into the
outer corner and really making this a
smokier look okay I'm scared so I'm
gonna start small and then see if it
goes bigger great because you can't take
black away once in there we thought you
can't it's just very difficult good tip
and it's tough like if any of you guys
decide to do this challenge at home with
yourself with your friends it's like you
have to kind of plan out how am I gonna
do this and not make it muddy how am I
gonna turn it out so there's not too
many different colors overlapping each
other you know so that's I think where
the lower lashline comes in handy and
you can sort of create a separate space
for something so in my case I had all
these different colors so blue blue is
gonna occupy that
it is such a good blue ok so what I did
was I ended up just winging it out a
little bit and I'm just gonna blend it
just a little bit up into the color but
I don't think I'm gonna do full on
smokey I'm just gonna blend it up a
little bit I think that's gonna be as
intense it's gonna be I'm down to two
shades here I've got my amber Rush and
my soft and sultry so amber rush a
little more like rose gold soft and
sultry it says very soft
champagne II kind of gold so I think I'm
going to work those you know on the
inner part here so amber rush kind of
right in this little gap that I've got
right down here I've used all my colors
at this point so now I'm just gonna kind
of go in and out and just try to get
them to magic I feel like the red is a
little more intense that burgundy shade
is a little more intense on this side
than this side so I'm just gonna kind of
go come on that's always my like ballet
thing is trying to get them so they
actually match I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the the Inglot cream shade
and put that on the lower lashlines and
kind of balance and blend into the black
so it's a little bit less harsh on the
lower lash line this gold is a little
deeper than I then I thought it was it's
kind of a dirty gold a little bit so I'm
not if this is my last shadow to place
somewhere and I really have no more real
estate maybe like the outer corner a
little bit like over there maybe yeah I
think that's where it's gonna live okay
okay I think I might be done I'm gonna
Pat just a little bit more of this just
to make the center of my lid pop the
shortcake shade that was a good decision
that was a good tip Jen for me to put
that there
oh thank you because okay and then I
think my very last thing I'm going to do
just to make this make a little more
sense I'm gonna pull a little bit of
blue on to my very outermost corner on
the upper part because see how right now
like they're they're kind of living in
their own separate worlds and I want to
bring it up there just a little bit
very nice and I think that I'm done
except for we're gonna do after we're
done with the eye look we're gonna do
liner and lashes off-camera I didn't
show the complete look because I really
feel like liner and lashes can really
just pull the whole thing together this
is what I've got going on as far as the
finished eye shadow unit and then with
three brushes three brushes and all
these differences that she had to make
go so I think that is a huge success
thank you I think I think that part of
it was just the look of the shades but
then part of it was just really doing
kind of starting with the ones and I
felt like we're the easiest and then
moving to the more difficult challenging
ones yeah I think helped a lot I feel
like I'm very mermaid glam like if I
could sum up this look in a word the
shine of that one shade yeah oh yeah I
think that urban cowboy really adds a
beautiful touch to it
definitely alright it's gorgeous we're
gonna say goodbye for a second yes and
we divide our lashes be right back
here's our faces how do we do I gotta
make I got to do the Emily down yep yep
look them expose the entire it's so good
I think you look so good thank you I
think yours came out really good too I
think he definitely had more of a
challenge without the match all those
brights but still you were able to pull
it together and I think it just looks
incredible thank you it's very mermaid
it is very more mating yours looks like
it came from like an already you like
put together palette you know like you
made everything look very put together
and a shiny silver are you guys seeing
where she put that you know they're in
them yeah pop so well I think that was
it better called in the lower lash line
it was so many shades to work in so if
you really want to challenge yourself I
think I think this is a fun game done
yet right definitely limits yeah get a
glass of wine if that's your thing and
hang out with your friends and play
eyeshadow bingo
