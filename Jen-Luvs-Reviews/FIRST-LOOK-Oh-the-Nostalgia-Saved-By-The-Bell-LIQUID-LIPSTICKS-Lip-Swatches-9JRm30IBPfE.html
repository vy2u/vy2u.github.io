mini review for you of the brand new
Sola look Saved by the Bell collection
it is so stinkin cute it comes with the
little sticker there and a pencil that
says Bayside Tigers on it I mean just
unnecessary yes adorable also yes comes
with three liquid lipsticks it is $40
the three colors are named after the
three major female characters in the
show this one is Lisa and as you can see
this formula this is the cryptic
cosmetics formula it is extremely
metallic just with one layer it is
absolutely beautiful I think Lisa is
actually my favorite shade in the pack
then you have Kelly which is a really
really bright vibrant pink I think it
fits with Kelly perfectly if you
remember the show important to note
about the formula they do dry down
completely but they are not sticky at
all and I don't have that dry flaky
really uncomfortable feeling on my lips
and they're very it's kind of a thin
formula so you don't really feel it on
your lips much as you wear it here's the
final shade this is Jesse and just a
frosty brown metallic oh so so pretty
really I'm gonna love wearing this this
is definitely one of my favorite lip
shades the metallic Brown I don't know I
love it so here just five minutes later
showing you the kiss proof test it
totally works and then some product
shots from the brand and honestly this
is a really really nice formula if you
like Saved by the Bell and you like
metallic lipsticks I definitely
recommend this set it does come out on
February 3rd at 11 a.m. PST this was
sent to me by solo look but this is not
a sponsored video I very rarely get
things sent to me early so I was very
excited to get this pre-launch
and excited to share it with you
hopefully found this video valuable mad
love to you and I will see you in a
video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
