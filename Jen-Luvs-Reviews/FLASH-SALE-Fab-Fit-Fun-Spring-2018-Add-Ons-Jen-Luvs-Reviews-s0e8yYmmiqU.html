love to get packages in the mail
especially if they're mystery products
but then sometimes it's kind of nice to
also get things at like really deep
discounts so I've got something for you
and I'm curious to hear your reaction
down in the comments below so hang tight
we're gonna get into it right now as you
may know I do have a partnership with
fabfitfun which is a seasonal
subscription box for a like beauty
fashion fitness lifestyle kinds of
products I do have a discount code I
will put it down below I don't benefit
off your use of the discount code it's
like a tracking thing to see whether
it's worth it for them to keep sending
me these boxes okay so this is really
interesting what that fit fun is doing
this month is they're giving you the
option of adding on a bunch of items to
your spring box and they sent them to me
as part of a sponsored video there's
gonna be this one and then there's gonna
be the spring box later where I'll show
you what I got in my spring box but this
one is I'm gonna show you all of the
add-ons that they have that they're that
are available right now and you can get
them all at a discounted price now
because I'm not a technical fabfitfun
subscriber I don't know the discounted
rates but if you sign up for the spring
box you'll be able to see the discounted
rates and whether you want to add any of
these products to your box I did ask the
folks over at fabfitfun a few questions
that I thought you were would have so
one of them is how many can you add on
and there is no limit to how many you
can add on the next question was is if
you're a new customer will you give and
be given the options to add on at
checkout and this is what she says
depending on if the new customer signs
up for the VIP annual membership or the
seasonal membership add-on options will
be available VIP annual members will
have access to the add-on items starting
on February 5th which of course has
already passed seasonal members will
have access the add-on items starting on
February 12th which has not passed yet
so if one of your viewers decides to
move forward with the seasonal
membership on February 7th they won't
have access to the spring add-ons if you
sign up for the seasonal membership on
February 13th you'll have access to
what's left on the add-on sale if you
are a seasonal member you can upgrade to
the annual subscription and that will
give
access to these items if you are an
existing member you should have gotten
an email about this but I will put the
link down below but if you're not an
annual subscriber the link won't give
you any of the items to view you have to
be logged in with your account and have
an annual membership in order to see the
items if you are a seasonal member you
should be getting this email on February
12th the prices on these items only last
until February 18th or until they sell
out so if you're interested in this I
would and you do have an annual
membership I would recommend going there
now and seeing what they have you have a
seasonal membership as soon as you get
that email go in and check out and see
what's there for you to purchase to add
on to your box but some of these
products are really really interesting
so I'm excited to share them with you
well constructive criticism Kelly this
is where you will enjoy this video if
you're not a bad bit fun subscriber I've
had the chance to try some of them so
I'm gonna be giving you a little bit of
first impression reviews on these
products so you can decide whether you
want to purchase these outright or not I
will be linking them down in the
description box below in case you want
to seek them out yourself without being
subscribed to fabfitfun so it's kind of
like a little first impression review
along with showing you what you can add
on at that discounted rates so again I
don't know what the discounted rates are
so I'm just gonna be putting it as my
little annotation the retail price and
then when you or if you are already
signed up for fabfitfun
you should be able to go to the link
down below and you should be able to see
the discounted rates let's go ahead and
start with this I actually use this for
the first time today and so far I like
it it is the living proof restore
perfecting spray the retail price is $29
at Ulta they say that it's supposed to
give you strength smoothness natural
shine time release conditioning natural
body detangling UV and heat protection
up to 400 degrees
whenever I have sprays I always like
them to have heat protectant in them I
don't like to use a plethora of products
on my hair because I don't know I've got
this thing that maybe it's gonna mess up
my hair to have too many products being
used
so it's nice to have all of that all
together in one product I've had great
experiences with living proof as a brand
and I've been very happy with everything
I've used from them so so far so good
again I've only used it once but it
seems to be good so far
next up they're offering the Campo relax
hydration body oil and it's an essential
oil blend and it's supposed to be for it
relaxing as soon as I take it on the
bottle I can smell it very very strongly
so again if you do not like fragrance if
you do not like strong sense this is not
going to be for you the retail price on
this is $49 at Campo Beauty comm so I'm
gonna go ahead and demonstrate the
product what you need to do is you need
to take a little bit of the oil
hopefully you have a table to set things
on I'm just gonna gently drip a little
bit onto my hands close this up hope I
don't spill it don't drip No so you're
supposed to rub it in your hands and
then you're supposed to cup it over your
nose like this and breathe it in deeply
and it's supposed to relax
you I don't know if I'm feeling an
immediate relaxing feeling like a
medicinal relaxing feeling but it is
quite calming and soothing it is a
straight boil so if you don't like
putting whales on your skin and of
course you're not going to like it but
it doesn't feel super oily and greasy at
least with a little bit of that I put on
my hands which was about three drops on
the palms of my hands there are no
artificial fragrances in here which is
nice there are no endocrine disruptors
or carcinogens according to them it's
also free of synthetics art affaire he
said artificial fragrances dyes parabens
sulfates phthalates PG GMO mineral oil
formaldehyde petroleum and fillers it is
cruelty-free
and it's made in California so it is a
nice oil in a few like essential oils
and no essential oils are huge and very
trendy right now if you like that this
may be something you want to invest in
the main ingredient in it is jojoba oil
and then sunflower seed oil and then
apricot kernel oil the lavender is the
most prominent scented one in here then
we have rosemary frankincense neroli
which I don't know what that is sweet
orange and bitter orange and I can
definitely smell a little bit of the
orange in here as well but I mostly
smell the lavender I don't know if I
know what frankincense smells like so I
can't count I went out you know what
frankincense smells like I I don't know
something I maybe I need to just seek
out some frankincense so I can learn
what it smells like for videos like this
but overall it seems very nice the third
product is the e salon without a trace
dry shampoo now last night I tried this
out and I'm telling you it worked it
worked really really nicely I'm so
kicking myself for not taking a picture
I was being impulsive because I can be
impulsive and I had I was on like third
day hair I think third maybe fourth day
hair oh it's go gross it was gross so I
sprayed this in in my hair actually
looked very nice when you spray this I'm
gonna put it on the back of my hand so
you can see there's no white cast here
which is a problem that I've always had
with a lot of dry shampoos especially
with my dark hair is the pull baby
powder look in the hair it just isn't
cute the scent is very mildly sweet a
little bit fruity but not a strong
alcohol smell like I've smelled with a
lot of dry shampoos so so far from one
use this has been a huge win for me I've
really enjoyed this it's supposed to
absorb oil impurities and revive style
now did it make me look like my hair was
freshly showered like it is right now no
it didn't but it definitely made it look
like I was on maybe second day hair
instead of like fourth day hair oh if I
want to stretch it a little bit more I
probably could using this I'm really
excited to have this in my life
next is the pixi by petra endless silky
i pen it's an eye liner i have not used
this yet a color like this as soon as I
see it I automatically think it'll be
nice for the lower lash line for
brightening but because it is yellow I
don't know how that's going to look a
true makeup artist is probably gonna
know better than I would but it's just
this creamy lemon yellow shade the
description from pixie Beauty calm it
looks like these might be a new formula
they're waterproof super long where no
smudge no budge eyeliners glide on like
seamless silk and they are creamy it
does to a creamy on my hand and a single
sweep motion creates a flawless solid
jewel tone line no retrack retouching
require
all day or night and again I haven't
tried it so I can't speak to the
longevity of it this Inn is in the shade
I see citrine it's got a green bottom
but it's definitely yellow on the top so
I mean I think I haven't had great luck
with pixee products overall but I know
what some of my friends really really
love their products so I don't have
personal high hopes for this but if you
like Pixy products and this seems
interesting to you a yellow you know eye
liner then this might be something
you're interested in this probably
wouldn't be something that I personally
would pick I just realized the second
ago that I have hardly any lashes on and
that was because I was planning on
putting these on first before the video
started and I forgot and already started
filming so we're gonna zoom in in a
second and go ahead and put these on for
the rest of the video these are the Zoe
I love premium magnetic eyelash
extensions and probably part of the
reason why I didn't do it is cuz I'm a
little scared that I'm gonna be spending
about half an hour hanging out with
these things I did watch a couple of
video reviews of products similar to
these not this particular brand but
similar to these and I'm a little scared
that they're going to be very difficult
to use but we're gonna try them out and
see now these are seventy dollars for
the two pairs you can find them at their
website at Zoe orzo I guess is OB ila
comm they say that they're the highest
quality fake mink fibers with gentle
care you can reuse them up to a 100
times and they are they do look like
they're kind of like half lashes I'm a
little scared so the idea is is that you
put one on the top over your lashes and
you put one on the bottom under your
lashes and they clip together and then
that is what gives you the fake lash you
know that it sticks they stick through a
magnet between your lashes like right
here like pinches your lashes so let's
go ahead and zoom in and try this right
now for the very first time alright so
I've got my simple human mirror I've got
my lashes and we're gonna go ahead and
try this out so I'm gonna go ahead and
put this right here
it's just kind of supposed to sit there
don't look down don't look down and then
this one oh I think it needs to move
over a little bit oh no I blinked no
blinking Noble inking aloud we need a
blank oh oh there it goes
darn oh no I dropped it no forever oh
never mind I found it this oh I think it
did it how does it look
it needs to be further over this way can
I just move it a little bit maybe
by the way eyeshadow today is the crayon
cases crayon box or box of crayons I'm
testing it today I play with it a little
bit last time I'm testing it today and
so far so good
you can see the magnet underneath my lid
a little bit right there which is kind
of weird but if you're far enough away
you might not be able to see it I can
see it though it's kind of bugging me a
little bit that I can see the magnet
it's also not if you can see it's not
flushed to my lashline so I'm gonna try
and push it so that it gets a little bit
closer that wasn't so bad I think the
videos that I saw we're at a really
tough time so this is just one pair of
lashes I said it was 2 pairs it's
actually just one
pal I just went in my eyeball I didn't
mean to do that okay this is definitely
not something if I was rushing that I
would want to have to deal with until I
got really good at it like it would have
to be something that I you know
practiced with and felt comfortable with
before I was like counting on it to work
and they are easy to take off like I'm
gonna take this one off and it doesn't
seem to be pulling my lashes at all to
remove which is really really nice I'm
gonna go ahead and put it back on now I
just wanted to see how easy it was to
remove there definitely a lot more
comfortable than fake lashes and then
traditional fake lashes there you go I
think that looks pretty decent my
biggest concern would be that I would
hit my eye or I get in a strong wind and
they would fly off but I definitely
think that this is something you could
use over and over and over and over
again without them getting damaged as
long as you're not touching your lashes
because they do come off really really
easily if like I accidentally rub my eye
my eyelash is falling off like that's
just gonna happen where that probably
wouldn't happen if I had actual glue on
my eyes but overall I mean I can feel
them but they do feel pretty comfortable
so I'm gonna go ahead and close my eyes
real quick and show you
and you can see look real closely you
should even seen the magnets a little
bit so are these worth $70 no there's no
way I would pay $70 for these but if
they're in a deep enough discount I
would consider purchasing these from
maybe $30 something like that but it's
up to you what your personal value is
but there's no way I would space $70 for
these but anyway that's enough about
these let's move on to the next project
while we're talking about Zoey I Lenore
Aylan however you say it let's talk
about the lash serum that they're
offering this is the brilliant eyelash
and eyebrow serum it's $50 at their
website I did use this last night and I
found the directions to be a little bit
strange this is mom this is supposed to
make your eyebrows and eyelashes thicker
in 60 days which is pretty typical for a
product that advertises this kind of
effect so you can see it's like this
little you know brush tip very fine
pointed brush tip you're supposed to
wipe off all the excess like that and
then you're supposed to dip it in the
serum just enough to pick up a drop like
that and then you're supposed to flip
the brush upside down for a second drop
for a second for the drop to soak into
the brush and not stay on its tip and
then you're supposed to apply it like
eyeliner after you apply it like
eyeliner you're supposed to Pat off any
excess which I thought was really weird
I've never had one say to Pat off any
excess the excess they don't want any of
the excess to go into your eyes so I
thought that was just a little excessive
as far as the directions and I'm
wondering why you have to go through all
of that like what it must have been some
kind of trial and error on the brand
that made them want you to go through
all that it's like it's complicated but
it's just a lot of steps that I thought
were kind of weird
you're supposed to using it two times
per day a minimum of one time per day
for 60 days now I did do some research
on eyelash serum I know people in the
collective brain and the comics section
have said that products like this work
very very well for them I did have a
product that I was using for a while
that I was buying at Ulta but I did see
some results from but in my research the
only product that actually can make your
lashes truly grow is Latisse which you
need a prescription for so if it depends
on what your previous experiences are
with this if this is something that you
want to try of course
a lot less expensive than letÃ­s so I
mean I think this one's kind of a
crapshoot on whether you feel like it's
something you want to try or not I don't
think this would have been something
that I would have invested in just
because I'm a little skeptical in the
directions or just you know not being
able to get it in your eyes I don't know
what there's just something about that
direction about blotting off the excess
that kind of freaks me out a little bit
so this one I probably wouldn't have
chosen but maybe you would choose it so
that's why I'm mentioning it for you not
for me this isn't about me this is about
you next is a product by E salon this is
the everlasting locks shower cap I have
never used a shower cap in my entire
life
but I will try to show you as best as I
can in case this is something you aren't
interested in it feels very soft and
kind of towel like in the center of it
and then of course it's like what that
waterproof like shower liner material on
the outside now the band is stretchy let
me just kind of put it on and just kind
of feel oh I just lost all my hearing I
can't hear anything now no I can hear a
little bit but it's just kind of weird
but it does feel snug here but it
doesn't feel too tight where it's
uncomfortable so if this is something
that you are interested in maybe you
would enjoy this because I don't use
shower caps I haven't used this and I
don't know much about it but I show it
to you anyway in case it's your thing
now this is what I'm actually kind of
excited about if you're an old-time
subscriber you know I didn't used to use
sheet masks but now I've been using them
more this is the Karuna brightening face
masks and you do get four of them in
here they are I think eight dollars a
piece at Ulta and Sephora and I looked
at the ingredients in this and the
ingredients in this are pretty legit
with a face mask of course you're only
doing a one-time-use thing but the
ingredients look really good if you like
face masks the people that are really
gonna want this are people that have
hyperpigmentation that is who this is
really for anybody that has any kind of
discoloration that you're trying to
solve so the number one ingredient in
this is water and then glycerin which is
a humectant it pulls moisture out of the
air into your skin and the third
ingredient is niacinamide and that's a
big ingredient that is very much touted
for helping with hyperpigmentation the
next ingredient is a chamomile flower
extract and that is a soothing and
anti-inflammatory ingredient
and then they have an Asian flavor
called Saxa Fraga sarmento so extract
and that is an anti-aging ingredient and
then we have something called skullcap
and that's an antioxidant
anti-inflammatory it also helps with
hyperpigmentation and also it may have
anti-cancer benefits so I thought that
was really cool I remember a lot of
these ingredients don't have a ton of
research behind them I think niacinamide
is probably the most research that I
have seen out of these things in here
but there are people that swear by these
ingredients but it looks legit there's
salicylic acid aloe leaf juice if you're
interested if you like face masks
especially if you have hyperpigmentation
this is definitely something I would
recommend you pick up just based on
ingredients alone not from trying it
just based on looking at the ingredients
now this is something kind of freaked me
out a little bit if you saw my monthly
favorites video for January you know I
had a bad experience with a peeling face
mask thing by June Jacobs this one kind
of freaked me out a little bit too this
is the green apple peel full strength by
juice beauty and when I looked at the
ingredients it freaked me out a little
bit but if you don't have sensitive skin
then maybe this would be for you I don't
know i don't have sensitive skin but
this i haven't used it yet but it kind
of freaks me a little bit it is an
exfoliating peel it's the sign for all
skin types
except sensitive skin for people in
their 20s and up is recommended for a
pier appearance of hyperpigmentation
dark spots and uneven skin tone and
texture it is not for people with
rosacea due to some of the ingredients
that are in here the first three
ingredients in this are apple juice
lemon juice and then aloe juice now
apple juice I will from what I've read
apples are best eaten not put on the
face there's a little bit of limited
research done with apples and it being
good for anti-aging antioxidant kind of
situation lemon juice there's some
research that says that it's good for
you but the negative research against
lemon juice is way way stronger because
it is so incredibly acidic but again
it's mixed in with a bunch of other
ingredients so
it may be okay but it's definitely not
ingredient I enjoy seeing also because
of the high level of vitamin C that
seems to be in here this would have a
shelf life so you want to make sure if
you do decide to get this you want to
use it up probably within a year there
is aloe juice in here which I love to
see it's a nice hydrating ingredient
after the aloe vera juice there's
glycolic acid which is an assh a and
it's to treat scarring and skin
discoloration signs of aging fine lines
and wrinkles and stuff like colic acid
is known to be amazing for those issues
there is a warning on the box that it
says you must use a sunscreen for at
least a week after you use this so just
be careful if you get this if I feel
like this is really meant for like
skincare junkies that really know what
they're doing so personally it says here
you're supposed to leave it on for 10
minutes I would start off with five
minutes and see how it is I or patch
test it for five minutes and see how it
is because this one kind of freaks me
out a little bit but this may sound
amazing to you and if it does then you
might want to consider picking it up
this one I already know I'm passing on
because I don't have acne but probably
maybe four times a year I'll get like
one pimple don't hate me this is the
murad acne control rapid relief acne
spot treatment I already know my friend
Fran is getting this this is going cute
Fran if you're watching this this is
gonna be for you I'll see you on
Thursday
it's 22 dollars at Sephora and it says
that it's a maximum strength 2%
salicylic acid gel that reduces blemish
size and redness in as little as four
hours the number one ingredient in this
is water followed by alcohol and alcohol
is definitely a skin drying ingredient
she would not want to put this all over
your face you really want to put this
just on your acne spots so this is seems
like it's pretty intense stuff so
definitely don't put this all over your
face but if you get the occasional
blemish every once in a while then this
may be something that you want to try
two more products left this is by Fraser
sterling and it's a necklace I did look
on their website and couldn't find this
exact necklace but they do have a
similar one called
the Versace pre layer and it was $70 now
it's marked down to fifty to fifty and
they do say that is gold toned I didn't
get information on this stuff from fat
so I just have to kind of go by the
research that I did there's these little
starbursts here occasionally you know
spaced around that are really pretty and
it is adjustable in the back it's got a
clasp this is the maximum length here so
if you have a larger nap this is the
maximum width of it can you see that the
space there now let me go ahead and put
it the smallest I can on me I'm gonna
put it on the very last one okay this is
the tightest one I don't feel like it's
choking me it's actually quite
comfortable I would probably put it on
at this this level of tightness so
that's what it looks like as far as the
length of it and I think that it's
pretty what I pay fifty two dollars for
it
no maybe it may be fifteen or twenty
dollars especially since it's like
golden it's not even gold-plated it's
gold two-toned
so I would worry about it you know
changing colors eventually if I wore it
a lot stuff like that so I don't know is
it your thing it's it's probably not my
thing personally but this again this is
the video isn't about me it's about you
and what you like so if you like this
that is what it looks like and finally I
think this might make me go back to the
gym to be completely honest with you I
was talking in live chat the other day
about how I haven't been to the gym in
over a year because I have a bum foot
that was not healing I might try to go
to the gym again and this may inspire me
to go this is the fit spacing journal
during the impossible seek the unknown
achieve greatness is what is on the
cover of this one I don't know if the
designs vary but this is the one that
they sent me and it's a it's a fitness
journal so in the beginning it since
this is mine and it gives you a place to
put your your information here and then
in here it says today I'm grateful for
my goal to live fit today is one thing I
appreciate about my strong bod today is
rate your day move nourish and reflect
and you can talk about the number of
minutes you worked out your energy level
this is definitely bullet journal lovers
without the actual drawing if you like
planners this thing is really cool it's
got inspirational quotes on the side and
you know you can write notes here things
that inspire you
and it like it's got this little tip
here on the bottom it says the odds of
reaching the goal are 64% if you write
it down the odds increase 76% if you
also tell a friend grab a pen then tell
a pal which i think is really cute so
this is 17 dollars on their website if
you just want to purchase it outright
it is a 16 week journal so I don't know
I think this is pretty cool I I think
that this would be something that I
would choose because I need something
like this in my life to get my butt back
to the gym because I'm so
cardiovascularly and muscle wise just
completely out of shape so I've just
told you and now I need to write it down
so that I actually increase my chances -
