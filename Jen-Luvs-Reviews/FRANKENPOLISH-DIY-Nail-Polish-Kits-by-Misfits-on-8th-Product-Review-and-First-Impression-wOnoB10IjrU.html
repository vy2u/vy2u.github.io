video for you today this is a really
really neat concept and I've never seen
it before maybe you guys have seen that
before but I haven't seen before so I'm
super excited about it it's a company
called misfits on 8 and basically what
they do is to give you the opportunity
of creating your own nail polish now a
long time ago I did do a Pinterest
Buster's video on creating your own nail
polish using a clear polish and a
crushed up eyeshadow and though that did
work initially all of all of the color
ended up settling to the bottom of the
nail polish it's a Polish I don't use
very often this is the real way to
create nail polish and it's actually
relatively inexpensive for this kid that
she sent me because I was sent this for
promotional purposes it is it was $25
for all of this and I think if it is
totally worth it and that's my honest
opinion it doesn't matter whether things
are sent to me I tell people right away
that I'm going to be honest so you get
what you get with me uh you know whether
I like it or not so this is a really
really neat idea and there were some
pros and cons to these that I made but I
want to go ahead and show you how it
works now one thing I want to tell you
is I did lose the instruction card so
when I was making these two polishes I
wasn't a hundred percent sure what I was
doing but I think that that kind of the
fact that it did turn out okay kind of
shows that really anybody can make these
polishes so I'm going to go ahead and
show you how I made these two polishes
right now alright so this is what you
get with the DIY kit one for the Franken
polish you get a 2 ounce suspension base
so that is your clear polish you get
four of the 15 milliliter bottles you
get four of the five milliliter bottles
you get stainless steel mixing bowls
those are right there you get 16 of
those you get a funnel you get a 1 gram
scoop
a 15 gram scoop you get a solid glitter
pack which are these here and then you
get a custom glitter pack which are
these more crazy ones down here alright
so I've somehow misplaced the directions
cards but you know how hard can this be
that in this is just a true test of how
easy this is to do so let's just start
with a small bottle I change my mind I'm
just gonna do a small bottle because I
don't know how I'm gonna do with this so
I'm gonna I'm gonna pick out some of
these glitters let's say you know what
this one looks really cool I'm going to
do just one with just that and see what
happens so I'm just going to move this
stuff out of the way opening up my
suspension base and supposedly this
stuff smells terrible and you're
supposed to make sure you're in a
ventilated area so I'm just going to
take this and put that there
that should be good right now I don't
smell anything which is a good thing now
I don't know if I'm supposed to pour the
glitter straight into there or if the
polish is going to impede the flow of
glitter into the bottle here because i
use the tube so we're just going to try
to put it in and see what happens
it does feel like it's look like it's
clumping in here that might just be
operator error and I don't know if I'm
doing this right so I lost the
instruction card and I want to get this
video up i've had this stuff for a
really long time and I feel terrible I
haven't made the video yet tap on shake
it up again now it looks really good so
what I'm going to do now is on my ugly
nails I'm going to paint some white and
we're gonna paint this on over top and
see what happens so as you can see this
glitter is definitely suspended in there
it's not sinking like if you buy in a
clear polish and you put glitter in it
it just sinks to the bottom at least
that's my experience with it but this is
you know the suspension is really
definitely happening there so now I've
used this julep polish in hope it's a
satin finish matte white and I love this
polish I've used that to just paint two
nails and we're gonna try and see what
happens dude you all right okay so right
now it looks to me like I do not have
enough glitter and it check that out
definitely not enough glitter so let's
go ahead and let's rewind and put some
more glitter in
person that is this company's probably
look no you're doing it all wrong you're
demoing my brother all I'm sorry I'm
sorry if I'm doing this all wrong
go there we go that's what we're looking
for that's pretty it's almost like Mardi
Gras looking and I can kind of place
some of the glitters too if I feel like
they're not going where I want I can
kind of pull some up and place them cool
so that was so fun I want to make one
more let's see how that goes okay so
basically what I did is I took this
little toe da bar out of my nail polish
remover and I just kind of ran it around
and tried to get it off and a lot of it
went inside and kind of clearing out a
little bit but i will put more notes
down below on exactly what I'm supposed
to do with this I'm sure there's a
better way to do it than the what I just
did okay so let's go ahead and let's do
another little one because I'm still
scared to do a pick one let us fill and
I'm going to just you saw me do this
before so I'm just going to cut two with
the bottle all the way full ok so the
bottle is all full and we'll go ahead
and put one of these glitters in let's
try it without it's working pretty well
without that let's just do it like that
oops nice boats off now I've gone and
done it all right I'll uh put two of
these babies in there because I think
they're supposed to be two in each one
two four six eight ten twelve fourteen
yeah i'm going to put two in
mom okay doesn't seem to be mixing as
quickly as the other one but it's
definitely mixing in there you got to
see how this stuff mixes in like how
cool those shaker balls are to go down I
don't know if you can see that but it's
just really fun to watch seeing that
mixing in there okay so I painted it on
to more nails this was with three scoops
and then this was with four scoops so
you can kind of see how that came out I
mean it's not a super exciting color but
it is really fun to make uh you know and
then what I could do to if I wanted to
is add a little bit of this green in
there I could add a little bit of red in
there I could add some of this teal in
there I'm really make it
multi-dimensional so let's just go for
it and let's just add a little bit when
you think green or teal green or teal
let's do some teal in there and then
make it like mermaid ish let's do it Wow
him a lot well as I spread it out it's
not as opaque as I expected it to be
it's definitely not clumping spreading
very evenly so again this is three
scoops the four scoops five scoops and
that what I've added a teal so hopefully
you can get an idea now of how these
polishes are made and whether this is
something you would like to try in your
own now here's my final verdict on it
like there's a restaurant here called
the melting pot and at the melting pot
it's a fondue restaurant they give you
all this raw food and they give you this
bowl of this hot oil and you cook your
own food in it now some people would
like to go to a restaurant and have the
food cooked for them and it's perfectly
wonderful to have your food cook for you
but if you want the joy of having fun
cooking your own food at the table and
seasoning it the way you like you can go
to a place like the melting pot and it's
stupid expensive now if you like that
with nail polish if you like the idea of
creating your own glitter polishes then
this Frank and polish kit may be
something that's good for you I feel
like you get a lot of good stuff in it
now they do have other versions of Frank
and polish other than this the glitters
you can make glow in the dark polishes
you can make you know just regular
colored polishes there's so much ok so
I'm reading off of her email cuz I said
you know is there anything else that you
wanted me to mention to my subscribers
and the people watching this video she
said it's mostly gloom the dark thermal
pigments are really new thermal pigments
are cool you know that they change based
on the heat as far as the color which is
really neat glitters and flakies I'm not
quite sure what flakies are though more
cool color change effects sparkly out of
them if you are that kind of crafty
person and she let kind of making things
from scratch this is really really fun
and you know these two polishes I'm not
you know what I probably have picked
this one up in the store no I wouldn't
have it's it's kind of boring it's you
know not I don't know i probably
wouldn't but this one is really cool and
i think i'm going to add more glitters
to this so that it has more to it but
this one's really cool and so I'm
anxious to try some of these other ones
i think it's going to be really fun so
definitely recommending this product to
you guys genuinely from a heart and soul
if you enjoy these kinds of things so
hopefully this video was helpful and
hopefully you found something new if not
just being entertained by the process of
how this is done so i hope you enjoyed
