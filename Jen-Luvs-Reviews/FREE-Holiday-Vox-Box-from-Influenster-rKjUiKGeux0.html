style go from wet to beautifully styled
hair faster than ever before to use a
quick style paddle brush as you would
use your usual brush to help speed the
styling routine it detangles my hair
removes excess water so this is really
neat i have never seen anything like
this before this must be a new product
from them that we get to try i am so
excited about this whoo hoo happy nail

sticker thingies and I've never used
these before because I always think that
I'm not going to be able to do them well
so now I get to try them for fee and
here is what they look like they're by
kiss nail dress fashion that sticks nuvo
is the name of the pattern and it looks
like a like almost like a armed with a
stone with cobblestone pattern black is
like an event key a little zebra mm-hmm

what else is in there Lila what is that
lipstick it's an NYC liquid lip shine
and I don't I don't usually like things

forty-nine cents the kiss nail dress are
699 for the package still stand looking

dollars for a box of 20 so this would be
less than a dollar no more than a dollar

we got this three absolutely one hundred
percent free box that's worth like 25

try this I'm really excited to try this
because I've been having trouble drying
my hair
and making it look good with that and
see all it's got that this padding in
their guest absorbs the water that is so
cool all right so if you're not signed
