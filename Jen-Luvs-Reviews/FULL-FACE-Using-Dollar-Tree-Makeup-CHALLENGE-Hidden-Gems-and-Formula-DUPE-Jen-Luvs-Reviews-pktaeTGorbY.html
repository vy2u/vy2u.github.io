dollar tree I am about to put on makeup
from the Dollar Tree yes this is gonna
be so fun hello my friends welcome to my
Dollar Tree challenge I am so excited
about this video I just did a bunch of
ingredient research and I've got some
really interesting things for you once
I'm done putting almost make up I've got
a big big thing to tell you so but we're
gonna do the makeup look first and then
I'll tell you about the big do penis
that I found the concept behind this
video is that you buy a full face of
makeup from the Dollar Tree one dollar
per item to see if you can create an
actually okay look using Dollar Tree
makeup the way that I'm interpreting
this is that I can use anything that I
bought from the Dollar Tree but I am NOT
going to use any tools that are not from
this bag of Dollar Tree goodness I also
except for one I am going to use these
sponges because I know they sell these
at the Dollar Tree I had a huge bag of
them I forgot to buy some while I was
there and I'm not going all the way you
know ten miles just to get some of these
when I have some in my house all right
so let me show you what I got a ton of
stuff because I'm not sure what's going
to work and what's not going to work the
first thing is that I could not find a
primer so I got these BB creams this is
called the sassy plus chic or sassy and
chic BB beauty cream multi-action
skincare makeup it says apply and blend
with fingertips so I think I'm gonna try
it with the finger tips and then I'll
use this if I need to I know I got two
shades but I don't see on here where the
two shades are it's not marked on the
packaging
nice sassy and chic I guess they just
make one bottle on I'm gonna use the one
that's slightly darker I'm so excited
about this challenge you have no idea I
I have so much fun just trying out new
products and seeing if they work so this
is like right up my alley right up my
alley because I love finding things that
are awesome and also cheap where's my
mirror I lost my mirror so we will do
what the directions say
we will blend with the fingertips holy
moly that's Gracie looking oh and it's
stinky - smells like foot cleaner this
is not attractive at all oh and it
smells so bad I can still smell it hmm
Oh like it's got a little bit of a
lotion II smell but it's like stronger
than that and more chemically oh my gosh
I don't want them to be able to wear
this all day because I'm scared of what
is seeping into my skin right now it's
funny once you start in researching
ingredients you realize how much junk is
in cosmetic products and it's a little
bit creepy all right so it's starting to
dry down a little bit I'm not quite as
creepy looking as I was a little while
ago but we'll use that for our primer
and I did get a light and medium this
was considered medium let me show you
the light on my hand just so you can see
what it looks like in case you decided
you wanted to purchase this this is for
the palest of the pale really really
really light okay so next up I got the
LA Colors liquid makeup and I got the
shade natural it was the lightest shade
that they had at the store so wish me
luck on this one actually it doesn't
look too bad it might actually cover up
a little bit of this white ghost face
that I just created it is a little bit
yellow but we will see we'll see what
happens I do have other videos to record
after this so I'm hoping I'll be able to
keep this makeup on try to pad it like a
Beauty Blender I feel like it's
accentuating my small pores
I have little pores anyway but I feel
like this is making them look larger all
right let's do another pump of it and
see if I can build up the coverage a
little bit they definitely added a
little bit of coverage but it's not
definitely not good
I have a positive attitude about this
I'm looking for my hidden gem you know
and I'm not gonna say something's good
if it's not the coverage of this is
actually not bad when you build it up I
definitely don't think I would choose to
use this but if you need something it's
actually not horrible with the second
coat oh it takes forever to blend with
this thing I'm so spoiled all right it's
still pretty much a light coverage light
to medium all right the color match
isn't horrible but it makes me look
really shiners LA Colors pressed powder
in the shade beige again the lightest
shade that they had there and it came
with this very very flimsy piece of foam
so we're going to use that and see if we
can make it work and I'm just gonna
press it into the skin trying to combat
some of this shininess that the
foundation created and it's not horrible
it's very powdery looking it's leaving a
powdery cast on my skin but it's not
horrible it's definitely working let's
tell you that I feel very matte and flat
okay hmm that is that's an interesting
look I'm not sure if I like it but
definitely mattified my skin I'll tell
you that I could not find an eye primer
so I'm just gonna go straight on with
eye shadow I thought about putting the
foundation on but I'm scared it's gonna
crease up really bad if I do so I got
these two eyeshadow palettes and I'm
going to play with them this is they're
both my la colors this one is the six
color palette in Haute and then this one
is the 12 color palette in trendy I'm
going to use a little sponge in here and
I'm gonna use this lightest shade up in
the top all over my lid to try to make
like a base it's very powdery
let's do crease oh my gosh how am I
gonna do the crease color without a
fluffy brush
I'm so spoiled this makes me just
remember how spoiled I am with all my
brushes and things all right we're going
to use this color right here it is a
ship satiny kind of color but I don't
have a matte cream shade I'm gonna put
that all open the cruise and it is not
dark enough so we're gonna switch over
and we're gonna do this one here try to
make a transition shade even though it's
shimmer but I don't have a choice not
really showing up much
oh no that's not too terrible it's just
a lot more work it seems a lot more
meaning it's taking me an extra minute
just to fetes than it typically would I
feel like my sponge applicator is about
to break now let's do oh let's do this
so this is the LA Colors shimmering
loose eyeshadow with brush and this is
in the shade sunshine and I'm gonna put
that all over my lid
and I am getting fallout but I expected
that I'm gonna focus on the center of my
lid and it's actually quite pretty
ok i am i have this lid of this
container I'm just gonna tip a little
bit on there is kind of like a palette
and apply with my fingers and see if
that helps with some of the fallout
issues whew yes it actually applies much
better with the fingers than the brush
but we are gonna just rock that yes oh
my goodness I am glowing you could see
me from the Sun with this so now we are
going to attempt to deepen up the outer
corner a little bit with this shade over
here and then I will clean up with some
tape which can be bought at the dollar
store I did not buy anything dollars so
I'm just gonna use my tape but I'm
assuming any tape will work so we're
gonna kind of deepen up that outer
corner this gold is crazy oh this is not
keeping up I don't think this is gonna
work looking back I should have put the
deep shade on before the glitter because
this is just taking the glitter right
off yeah that's not gonna work I think
we're gonna be stuck with this as is
because I don't think anything is going
to be able to compete with this glitter
apparently we have a tape shortage in
the house so I'm going to use my packing
tape because that's all I have and I'm
going to
I get this try to get this glitter off
and it is working pretty well it's also
taking a lot of the powder off though so
I may have to reap out her so there you
go so I think I'm just going to have to
leave it like that because I can't get
the eyeshadows in the palette to combat
with the glitter here so let me tell you
what I learned when looking up
ingredients for these eyeshadow palettes
and then we'll finish the look so you
guys remember when I did my Holy Grail
by the boss Holy Grail versus my Anasazi
Beverly Hills modern renaissance palette
smack down so I was looking at the
ingredients for the LA color stuff and I
was like this stuff looks really
familiar so I'm gonna put down here the
ingredients for the morphe 35o palette
and the LA colors pressed palette so you
can see that's these right here and then
I'm gonna put down the ingredients for
the shimmer kind compared to the morphe
35o and I think it's very interesting
that there are so many similar
ingredients between the morphe 35o and
the LA colors I mean these are just a
dollar and the 35o everybody just
freaking out over that palette and I'm
not saying it's a bad palette I'm just
saying that the same ingredients happen
to be also in this Dollar Tree makeup
which i think is crazy that you know
that we can rate we're raving and raving
and raving about this palette but it
just because a palette performs well
doesn't mean that it has to be expensive
not that morpheus super expensive but
it's not a dollar you know so I just
think that it's I don't know I found it
very interesting that the ingredients
were very very similar they're not the
same but they're very similar and they
share a lot of common ingredients so
that also compares it to the violet Voss
the violet Voss eyes shadow 'z are very
similar to the morphe premiums so oh no
I'm just saying I'm just presenting I'm
not saying anything under than this is
the fact take it and do with it what you
will for brows I had a really tough time
finding a brow product that was my shade
so I got these color mates eyeliner and
eyebrow pencils this is in the shade
black brown but it's really like a
medium brown and then I got the LA color
eyeliner slash brow pencil and this one
is a black shade so I'm gonna try to mix
them together and see if I can make it
work we will see o my brows gonna look
crazy right now I don't look too crazy
but I'm gonna in a minute if I can't
make this work and I'm just gonna go
from the middle outward it kind of
reminds me of the older one in the way
that it feels kind of waxy it goes on
very easily I am surprised again this is
the one that's the color mates 1 wow I'm
actually impressed with this this is not
bad at all I could use this like I could
use this definitely I am NOT going to
get rid of these pencils they are not
bad effective feeling a lot of this was
going to be going in the trash after I
bought it but I'm gonna keep that pencil
and it came with two of them for a
dollar so let's go into eyeliner I got
this LA Colors liquid eyeliner I haven't
used liquid eyeliner in a long time like
a legit with a brush liquid eyeliner so
wish me luck that I don't ruin
everything that I did whoo that is glow
see it's very black though that went on
super easy what go la colors you serious
nice job oh oh but if you mess up man
it's all over that isn't that bad now I
can't hold my mirror and do my way at
the same time
so I'm gonna have to get creative here
little scared but the point is very fine
so I think it might be okay
this is so easy to go on it kind of
tickles though all right we have ways we
have works all right
7li not my favorite but I think that's I
think that's operator error I think
that's just me not being used to doing
wings with this kind of product
definitely it's definitely me it's not
the product I really want to itch my
eyes though like it was so tickly going
on I want to itch so bad I want to just
go for lower lashline I'm gonna use this
one this is the eyeliner slash brow
pencil in black and I'm just gonna put
that down here okay and then we'll use a
little bit room a little bit of this and
I'm gonna put it on a sponge applicator
and kind of pop it on the lower lash
line whoo that's not good oh man I'm
gonna fall out now again that was stupid
so now this is the part I'm a little
nervous about we have the mascara now
the mascara wand looks really bad the
bristles are very spaced very far apart
it's spirally it's just not a wand that
typically performs well for me this is
the LA Colors it just says mascara and I
believe it's in black and we're gonna
try it anyway see how it goes well
that's not terrible yeah it is huh it's
making my eyelashes darker which is good
but it's adding zero length and zero
volume it's basically just coloring the
lashes this is not a good mascara just
so yeah it is not worth a dollar it is
worth nothing but we're still gonna put
it on because that's what I have and I
have nothing else I would have bought
some false lashes if they had them but
they did not have them well that's gonna
I think that's gonna kind of kill the
look a little bit you know I feel like
lashes really finish things up and make
it look like the look is done
the look will not be done second coat
it's building the length a little bit
though
it's building it a little bit if you
have already really long gorgeous lashes
you might be able to get away with this
I could build and build until I am 95
and I don't think it will get much
better so we're just gonna let that one
go and say well that's a fail on the
mascara ok cheap products I got two
cheap products because I wasn't sure it
was gonna work I got the color mates
blush in this shade sun kissed tan and
then I got the LA colors and peach rose
and see it looks like this one is more
pigmented the color mate so we'll go
with that one and we'll take the little
brush out of the packaging and let's see
how this goes it has some gold glitter
in the base of it this brush is not
making me happy but we might be able to
make it work I'm trying to swirl it
around as if it's a bigger fluffier
brush it's just not blending out okay
I'm gonna take this sponge and kind of
try to blend it out a little bit with
this clean sponge the brush I think is
making the difference of it not working
if I just had a fluffy brush I think I'd
be okay if the dollar store is your
friend for makeup I would recommend the
elf blush brush it is amazing I think
it's three dollars just to minimize some
of this work here because this is
difficult and I really don't think it's
the blush I think it's the brush so for
lips lips is the last step I got two lip
products and they are both by LA Colors
I got two shades
I got natural shine and dusty rose I
think I'm gonna go with natural shine I
did not get a lip liner
it smells really good it smells like
vanilla candy
I thought it would be patchy er but it's
not patching hmm that's not too bad that
actually looks kind of nice I do feel
like my face is very cake face II and I
think it has to do with the powder I
don't think that it is the I don't think
that it's the foundation I don't know it
might be the foundation to it might be a
combination but I feel like I look very
unnatural right now like I don't know if
you can tell on camera but to me I look
very unnatural
there you go I'll put a little bit of
this over top of the blush it kind of
blended out a little bit I don't think
that's a bad look I don't I don't think
it's bad from all of this I want to tell
you what I would recommend from first
impression what juries kind of still out
on and what I definitely do not
recommend so for recommends I definitely
really like the color mates sun-kissed
tan blush I feel like it just needs a
different brush to go with it to make
the application easier I definitely
recommend the LA color shimmering loose
eyeshadow but definitely applying with
your finger rather than the little brush
that comes in here or if you have a
different brush you may want to try it
but definitely applies better with the
fingertips I really like the LA Colors
liquid eyeliner so far went on super
easy super black
I like the LA Colors lipstick for a
dollar it's very nice natural shine I'm
curious to see how it wears but for a
dollar I think it looks really nice and
then the color mates eyeliner pencil and
black brown that I used for my brows
really liked that for things that the
jury's still out on the eyeshadow
palettes because I jumped so quickly to
be able to use this I don't think that I
gave these a fair enough shot I
definitely want to play with these more
and see whether they will be worth a
purchase or not even for a dollar they
seem like they might be okay for a
dollar but I definitely don't feel like
I got a chance to use them enough
Jerry's also still out on the eyeliner
brow pencil by LA Colors I'd like to see
whether it runs or not whether it's
really bad but it seems to apply pretty
nicely to the lower lash line it's not
bad so far things that I definitely
would not recommend thus a C+ chic BB
cream went on crazy looking just ghostie
and shiny and it smells horrible I do
not recommend the LA Colors liquid
makeup this is made me look like I have
huge pores
I don't have huge pores just accentuated
everything really don't like that really
don't like the powder the powder made me
look like I had cake face it just made
the effects of this even worse I would
be curious to know what this would look
like over a different foundation but I
still would not recommend it and the
mascara was horrible the LA Colors
mascara did absolutely nothing so those
are my Dollar Tree products and I hope
you like the look that I created I think
it came out pretty good for a Dollar
Tree I feel like we did all right so it
just goes to show that you can get a
nice look even from dollar store makeup
