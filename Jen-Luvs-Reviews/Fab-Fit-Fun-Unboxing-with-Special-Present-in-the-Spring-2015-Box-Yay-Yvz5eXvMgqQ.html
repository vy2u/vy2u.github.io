fit fun unboxing it was funny I was in
chat my my weekly chat that I do every
Sunday morning and I forgot what was it
might have been Nicole from yay or nay
with Nicole that's my special ves report
I think I might have it her was like hey
have you ever tried fabfitfun and I was
like I got one it was just very ironic
that she asked about that and I happen
to get one that fit fun contacted me and
asked me to review their box and I was
really excited because I've heard lots
of great things about the subscription
along with the subscription you also get
something else that they wanted me to
tell you about and that is a water
infuser water bottle and oh my goodness
okay so there's here's the back story
back in January or February I posted a
picture of a bottle like this on my
Instagram I'll put the picture right
there and I was like I'm trying out
recipes it's like people give me advice
on this and a bunch of my Instagram
followers and friends gave me some
advice on some recipes that I should use
and I fell in love with this water
bottle part of the reason why I fell in
love with this water bottle is because
my students my fourth-grade students
love this water bottle like every time I
come in they're like how's your water
today is it good what do you have in
there because this is like such a
talking point when you're carrying this
thing around it's like everybody wants
to know what in the world like my
assistant principal comes to me and she
was like it's the what it's the fruit
floating in there like what is happening
so when fat that phone contact me and
said that this was in their box and they
wanted me to tell you about it I was
like I have no problem doing that
because I already know I'm going to love
this and this one is even cooler than
the one I had because it's just it's
pink number one and number two on the
bottom it says grab life by the exercise
balls and it just I mean that makes it
even more of a talking point so this one
is like a gazillion times cuter than the
one that I add what I wanted to show you
really quickly was some recipes of what
I use in my water bottle and then I'll
show you the fabfitfun box so I'm gonna
go ahead and show you those recipes
right now alright so let's just show you
the water bottle first this is the
bottle and you just unscrew the top
there and then this is part of the
filtering system there you just pull
that whole piece out and this is where
you put the fruit so that it can be
infused into the water so make sure you
rinse off your fruit before you put it
into your infuser I put about half of a
handful of raspberries and then for the
lemon you want to slice it very very
thin as thin as you can and really get
like the middle of the lemon you don't
want the outside because it doesn't have
as much juice in it unless you just want
less of a lemon flavor and then I just
kind of layer it in there so I put a
slice of lemon then my raspberries and
then another slice of lemon and then
screw my top on the top and that's it
that's the entire recipe it's so fast
and easy if you have lemon in your house
so that's what that looks like and now
that's what it looks like with the water
actually in it and now I'm going to show
you the no one in the world keeps the
fresh lemon in their house recipe so I
put that handful of raspberries but now
since I'm not going to use the lemon I
had to rinse off more raspberries and
then I put just the raspberries in there
and then we get this eleven juice which
is much easier to keep in the house I
had a brand new one so I had to open it
and then you just squeeze a squeeze of
lemon juice in there and I feel like it
makes the raspberries last longer as
well and it tastes just as good as
having the sliced lemon in there having
that lemon juice the only thing is is
that if you refill your water bottle
during the day you're not going to have
that lemon it's just gonna be the
raspberries leftover but it tastes
really good and I really like that
recipe a lot so next we're gonna do
another recipe this one is strawberry
cucumber and mint so I just chopped the
tops off but honestly that's not even
100% necessary what you do want to do is
make sure that the inner portion of the
strawberry does stick out some or if
you're feeling really really in a rush
you can just squeeze it with your hand
and then drop it in as long as the
inside of the strawberries exposed it
doesn't have to be beautiful I just cut
them into quarters and look at this
gigantic cucumber so not necessary to
get a gigantic ER cucumber but that's
what my grocery store had and then again
just like the lemons you want to cut
these very very thin it just looks
pretty that way to have them thinly
sliced in there
and then I just layer those in there as
well just a few strawberry slices a few
cucumbers 'mentally a few strawberry
slices cucumber mint leaf and just kind
of go like that until it's all filled up
and look how pretty that looks in the
water it just looks beautiful all
layered like that so let's go ahead and
move on to recipe number four
technically this is going to be
watermelon and mint which is also a
really nice light refreshing one you get
the sugary sweetness of and the the
watermelon but you also get the
refreshing mint in there and it's just a
really nice contrast and this is just
the way that I personally cut a
watermelon if my mother watches this
video she's going to freak out because
of how close the knife gets to my finger
but you know I feel like I've done this
so many times I don't you know why they
all cut myself and all I'll stop being
so full of myself about not being able
to cut something like that but anyway so
we're just layering now the watermelon
in the mint just like we did with the
strawberry and that's the way that looks
in the water so yummy and delicious and
then here's the last recipe this one's a
really simple one because a lot of times
I'll have the strawberries and the
blueberries in the house just because
the kids like to eat them so this one's
pretty accessible but you can do Josh
strawberries you can do just blueberries
it's really whatever you have and one
trick I found with the blueberries it's
actually kind of fun it's to squish them
before you put them in and that really
helps the juice to infuse a little bit
better so just doing a few of each I did
about five blueberries and then you know
three or four slices of strawberry and
then five more blueberries three or four
slices of strawberry just to make it
look pretty it's absolutely not
necessary to layer it it just looks
prettier that way and then I've added
the water now and just to give it a
little bit of tartness I've added a
little bit of lemon juice to this but
that's not necessary
it tastes fabulous without the lemon
juice it's really your personal
preference is just kind of an optional
and that's the way that one looks
and this is the thing about it is you
really can't mess it up
I mean well yes you can you can mess it
up one time I put apples and
strawberries and something I don't know
but it tasted like vomit it was horrible
so it is possible to make recipes that
are terrible so what you do is you just
learn from your mistake and you just
never do that again
so you just have to figure out the
recipes that work for you those are ones
that I showed you were all like
tried-and-true amazing recipes and you
know there's no measuring involved you
just stop the stuff in there and if you
don't have you know the blueberries one
day just put strawberries in it if you
don't have you know just put lemon in
there if that's all you have I mean it
doesn't have to be like a recipe you
know people think a recipe oh I got to
go to the grocery store you know you
don't necessarily need all of that all
you need is one ingredient to make this
awesome really the biggest benefit for
this and people have asked me before
about like the nutritional benefits of
this there really are no nutritional
benefits for this as far as you know the
amount of fruit that actually gets into
the water it's insignificant but what it
does is it keeps you from drinking a
soda or a vitamin water or some of those
things that have 35 grams of sugar in
them and the hydration is just so
important when you ask any doctor about
drinking more water and how important
that is for your health to drink a lot
of water I mean this is just such a
wonderful way to get your water and and
what I do is I'll usually drink two of
these in a day I'll drink one in the
morning and then at lunchtime I'll fill
it up again and it's still amazing like
it takes a little while for the flavor
to be fully infused it takes a good 2 to
3 hours for it to be completely infused
but I don't care I just keep filling it
up and I get a little bit of flavor I
get a lot of flavor out care some days I
get more flavor those I mean the point
is is it I'm drinking more water and and
I think that's where I've gotten the
best benefit from this bottle and that's
from my heart that's not just because of
fabfitfun that's from a heart and the
other thing that I do is after I drink
my second one on the way home I eat the
fruit and then that way I get all the
fiber of the nutrients from the fruit as
well so and it makes it my snack you
know and it stays good so I really like
that a lot alright so now that I've
talked enough about the water bottle
let's go
- what is in the spring fabfitfun box it
really is for people that are interested
in fitness and health and and improving
their well-being and all that but
there's also some lifestyle stuff in
here that's pretty interesting so it
comes packed to the top of this box
I've already unboxed it so it's not as
pretty as it once was I'm just gonna
pull everything out and show you inside
of course you get a card that tells you
what everything is and the value of
everything and I'm gonna be putting that
over here as I go
the first thing in here then the first
thing in here is this scarf and I am NOT
skilled at scarves but I'm trying to
learn let's just kind of know how do you
even do this hmm but I'll watch a scarf
tutorial video and figure out how in the
world to wear this thing oh but it's
really cute it's got a really cute
pattern and I like it a lot it can go
with a lot of different outfits and I'm
very excited about this scarf it seems
to be a very high-quality really really
like this the next thing in here are
these metal tattoo stickers and I don't
know how I feel about tattoos stickers
um I feel like I'm a little old for this
I passed a lot of these on to my son's
teacher she loves these I will probably
pass these on to her as well I've heard
that they can be very nice for nail
design so maybe chop this one up and
make it into nail designs I think that
would be cool but I probably won't wear
these as tattoos it's just not my
personal style but I know there are
really really huge huge trend right now
the next thing in here is the intense
body blast Pilates interval training 3
DVD sets I have done never done Pilates
it looks like there are three different
levels there's difficulty level 3 4 and
5 there are 37 minute or 30 4-minute
workout 29 minute workout I'm gonna
start with level one it also says that
it comes with a $25 gift card toward one
of their 500 fitness products so that's
really say next thing in here is this
grow bowls combination mulch at seed and
fertilizer basil seed seed pod and this
is awesome because you can actually use
this for your water infuser I've seen
people put basil in with strawberries
okay you just bury it you bury it in a
grow
and that is about as easy as it needs to
be for me because I kill everything
plant why his phone this was gonna get
buried in my yard and we'll we'll get
some basil and that'll be amazing that
sounds like fun
yeah yeah that's exciting I'm really
excited about that I didn't realize it
was that easy I hadn't read at that so
I'm excited about that next up is the
Cosmo creation salted caramel premium
puffed corn and we'll go ahead and open
this as very sugary tasting dark teen
grams of sugar just ain't a health food
that's good but this is not a health
food sorry it's not but it tastes really
good this it's non-gmo corn gluten free
no trans fat no kernels no halts
ingredients ingredients you can
pronounce which is always really really
good the number one ingredient is cane
sugar so just be aware of that all right
next thing we have is the Palmetto derma
collagen booster and restoration serum
which is very exciting it's a Sun smoke
and smog suck but this spring you're in
luck because we're giving you a free
radical fighting super serum to keep
your skin safe from the daily elements
that's really cool gonna pop a little
bit out on my hands there's no scent to
it which is great I know a lot of people
are sensitive to scents rubbing it in it
feels good
it doesn't feel oily it just feels like
a wetness and it's seeping in and it
feels nice like this this feels good
this is nice for a summer day you've
been all day you wash your face put this
on there's no tackiness to it sometimes
serums will give you a tackiness I don't
feel any tackiness that's some good
stuff next up we have a couple of Orly
nail polishes as this one is in cakepop
let's check out the opacity here looks
like it's probably a two to three coat
polish probably three coats doesn't look
super opaque but I'm sure I will use
this to be a really nice base coat for
nail art and I seen because of what's up
in makeup that these light pastel colors
are really on trend right now and then
also I got the beady cream makeup for
nails this is cool the only BB cream is
designed to perfect the look of natural
nails with this all-in-one a topical
cosmetic treatment that helps to smooth
moisturize brighten natural
with a shear peach tent I don't know if
my nails are ready for that
they aren't quite stained from wearing
so much polish but I really should go
through a cleansing and use this but
that's kind of a cool concept you know
to kind of brighten and make your
natural nails look beautiful that's
really cool I will definitely be trying
that and I'm really excited to have that
cuz I've never tried anything like that
before
rifle paper which they do a lot of stuff
with Birchbox so I am familiar and it
looks like it is a box of coasters and
also a twenty five twenty five percent
off code and I will put that code down
below in case anybody wants to use it it
says it expires June 1st so there's
plenty of time on that which is cool and
there's coasters in here there's one for
New York one for London whoa one for
Tokyo one for Paris New York London
Tokyo I bet the last ones Paris I'm
psychic that's really cool I I think you
can always use more coasters in your
house you know I mean they get messed up
so easily and so quickly that it's nice
to have cute coasters around the table
and we're planning on moving soon so
this will be a really nice addition to
our new living room whenever we are able
to move so that's gonna be awesome looks
like a bunch of coupons oh no there's
something else in here what is this I
need to see this before boom these are
over brushes oh oh I didn't even see
these I love Oprah I always call them
Ofra but I realized that I think that
it's Oprah and not opera would they feel
soft ooh but they're kind of flat which
is my least favorite type of brush but
they're very very soft and I really need
to learn how to use these kinds of
brushes I'm just I don't know these kind
of brushes I always have trouble working
for me but I think that it's operator
error I 11 is perfect for eyeshadow
application okay that's this one and 20
is designed to help you apply concealer
corrector any liquid or silk peptide
foundation I probably wouldn't use this
for a foundation because it's so small
it would take like a million years to
apply but I would use this for my
under-eye and it feels really good it's
a feels like a nice brush the ferrule
seems to be on there very nicely and
they've got kind of a slight greenish
kind of tint to the hands all and
they're beautiful
okay so now
a bunch of coupons in here this one is a
$125 holy moly in vow to these chic
designer bridesmaid dresses and little
white dresses for rent I probably won't
use that as I don't really go anywhere
nice so I don't really I'm not really in
need for that that's really nice for the
right person this one is Merrithew
Merrithew it's $25 oh this is for the
fitness products this is the company for
the the Pilates company so this is the
$25 for their store that's cool and then
grobel seedpods I guess it's just a
directions card on how to use it next up
is one I'm really excited about which is
hellofresh
I got one of these in my new Beauty test
tube and I am stinking in love with this
subscription like no joke I don't know
what I would do without this at this
point put my hellofresh
discount code below where I get a credit
if you sign up using my link and then
you get $40 off your first box I will
put that down below it's amazing I don't
want to go into too much about
hellofresh but it is a they ship fresh
food ingredients to your house and they
have the recipe and everything's
pre-portioned and it's amazing and I
highly recommend this if you're really
busy but you enjoy cooking I highly
recommend the service but that's it for
the fab fit fun box for spring I know
this is this seems like it's been a
really long video but I have a lot to
show you just really a great BOC sponsor
items are always a bonus so including
that they don't they don't count the
gift cards at all so not counting the
gift cards the total value of this box
is 273 dollars and 89 cents I will just
insert my personal value of what I
attribute to these I always do that with
all of my unboxings of what I would pay
for these I personally I know that I
mind is going to be under two hundred
seventy-three dollars just because I
never think that products are worth but
they say they're worth but um you know
it is what it is I'm honest so that's
what happens so overall really happy
with my first fabfitfun box I don't know
if I'm gonna get more of these or if
this is a one-time thing but I do think
that that fun for sending this to me
I don't know what else I want to tell
you uh this is a really good box and I
really enjoyed opening it I feel like
it's totally worth the subscription
price absolutely and I will put a coupon
code down below to get the fabfitfun
water bottle you do have to enter a
coupon code in order to get that for
free I think it comes up as a 1 cent
discount that's how you know that the
code worked and that's the only place
you can get this particular water bottle
is through fabfitfun you can't get the
grab the life by the exercise balls
anywhere else except for a fabfitfun in
the spring box so so much for watching I
