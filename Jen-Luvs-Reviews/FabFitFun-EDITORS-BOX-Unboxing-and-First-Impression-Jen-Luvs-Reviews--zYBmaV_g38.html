editors box unboxing I did do an
unboxing for fabfitfun in the fall and
when they contacted me and told me they
wanted to also send me and sponsor a
video on the editors box so super
excited because I love the fall box it
was so good like honestly so good like I
really really enjoyed it I will link
that video down below in case you want
to check it out if you have never heard
of fabfitfun it is a 50 dollar quarterly
subscription I think this one is in
addition to their typical ones that they
do because it is the editors box I think
it's like a favorites from the year
which is pretty cool it is a lifestyle
Fitness Beauty kind of box you get a
nice mix of a lot of different things if
you're overloaded with beauty
subscription stuff this may be a good
option for you because it sometimes
there's like makeup skincare haircare
stuff in here but there's also other
things in here as well I do have a $10
off discount code down in the
description of below that they have
provided me with but I do not benefit
from your sign ups it's just a discount
code for you that's just for you and
it's a nice way for them to track and
see who is going to fabfitfun from my
channel but I do not money-wise benefit
from your visit to their website one
thing that they have told me about this
box is that there is a special surprise
in each box that may be different from
other people that are getting the box
it's like one eye like everything is the
same except for the one item that's like
your special bonus item which i think is
pretty cool
you guys know how much I love a good
surprise so let's go ahead and find out
what's in here because I love not
knowing what's in these boxes it's super
fun they did send me a list of what was
in here but I wouldn't like this and I
was like no I am NOT looking I am NOT
looking so the first thing in here is a
little magazine that has the products in
it and it says editors box on there and
then there's some giveaway stuff on the
back but I'm not going to look at that
and then this is the inside of the bus
they have a little sticker on there
let's rip that off
I'm already excited because I see this
this is a ModCloth blanket scarf they
gave us one of these in the fall box and
I have to tell you I have never used it
as a scarf no that's not true I've used
it a couple times as a scarf but I've
actually been using it as a light
blanket my looking from when I get cold
so I'm excited to have another one of
these I will hopefully use this as a
scarf at some point but I've not I will
definitely be using it as a blanket it
is so soft and squishy and it just feels
really good it just it's it's nice it's
really nice might sometimes my kids
steal it from me because it's so soft
like give me my scarf back I'm cuddling
with my own scarf get your own scarf so
now I can share one with my kids so
that's pretty cool
there is a $40 off coupon for hellofresh
I did not have a great experience
personally with hellofresh
but my friend Nicole over at yen rate
yay or nay Nicole she really loves Hello
fresh and it's always been wonderful for
her I never did any unboxings or
anything on the channel but I did do
some periscopes about it a long time ago
so yeah but so I for people that haven't
tried it these food subscriptions are
pretty fun to get all right so let's see
what else is in here what is this okay
this is o manna cos our beauty
lip-locked priming priming gloss stain
Oh a gloss stain that sounds cool it's
in the shade lucky I hope it is not
green because I would not wear a green
lip product that is just me unless it
was like pretty light-colored and kind
of was more of a tint than anything
let's say it's called lucky let's see
what did I get
woo that's pretty this is very much a me
color I like that shade smells a little
plasticky Gunsmoke great but the shade
is pretty woo very opaque I'm excited to
try that though because I think I've
ever tried anything from Anika dar I'm
really excited about that
nice we have mineral peel face a mineral
peel face o RG skincare maybe this is
something was lost in translation
because I'm not trying to peel my face
well I guess I am kind of mineral peel
face maybe it means face peel that's
what I'm assuming I think they just got
their words mixed up a little bit
natural non abrasive exfoliant with
brightening aged
it's very nice what's a spray bottle so
let me spray it I want to see what it
smells like it smells kind of nice has a
little bit of a floral a tad bit of a
citrusy kind of scent so very neat I you
know I'm not a huge fan of spraying
things on my face so I have a feeling
I'll try this see what it's like and
it'll probably end up getting passed on
just because I don't enjoy that whole
thing like I don't use setting sprays I
just don't like that that's just me
personally but again personal preference
ooh
Marrakech oil Argan and hemp wheel
therapy Oh girlfriend or boyfriend I
need this so bad ooh frizz free glossy
shine I need that in my life right now
come on come on okay so it's a gel
smells like brown sugar feels like argan
oil that's gonna work that through
work it girl work it oh that feels good
ooh very nice very nice do I look
shinier my curls shiny very excited
about that I can always use more hair
wheels I go through hair oils like you
would not believe because my hair gets
so dry in the winter time oh so excited
about this I don't know which ones my
extra product so I'll have to look in
the magazine to find out okay so next up
Oh another one of these cops this was
from the fall box as well it says good
morning gorgeous my other one says
happiness comes in the morning which I
learned is a part of a Bible verse and I
use that cup all the time so I'm very
excited to have another one of these
good morning gorgeous it's always nice
to be called gorgeous in the morning
even from an inanimate object who cannot
see you it's so nice so I'm very
thankful to have another one of these
and then in here this is a necklace and
it says inspire it says happy dream love
inspire it's a little bar necklace oh
and it's by a brand called jokin ona
Chuck and no no I've never heard of that
before
and I like that it doesn't it's not
going to tangle super easily some of
these necklaces really tangle easily
let's try it on so we can see the
like that is perfect I really like that
a lot I really like that and I always
feel like I want to inspire others so
this is a perfect necklace for me I
don't know if I do inspire others but I
like to think that I would alright and
then next thing is another thing from
the fall box this is the natural
coloring book illustrate and meditate
with colored pencils actually gave the
colored pencils to my son and I gave the
coloring book to my daughter so maybe
one of her friends would want this I am
NOT a big coloring person it's just not
my thing so me or maybe I'll drop it off
my husband's tattoo studio see if
anybody there would want to color with
it but this kind of isn't really my
thing but I know these are really really
popular right now it's just not a with
my personal preferences alright so the
question is now whether I would pay
fifty dollars for this box it is over
$200 worth of product but sometimes even
monetarily sometimes things are just not
worth to you because you just wouldn't
have purchased it so I do love the
necklace I'm very excited about that
that's definitely gonna add to the value
I'm not gonna add the coloring book into
the value because that's something I
never would have purchased I probably
I'm not gonna add this into the value
because I don't really like spring
things on my face so I'm not gonna add
that in I'm only gonna be talking about
the things that we'll actually use so
the necklace the lipgloss the coffee mug
the hair oil and the blanket scarf and I
honestly feel like this is worth 50
dollars to me personally I would use all
of these things at least so far I'll
have to try the manic Adar and make sure
that that's something I would use but
looking at this it does seem to be at
least $50 monetarily I mean this is
gonna be at least $30 here this is gonna
be at least $20 here so just between
these two things that's gonna be $50 win
