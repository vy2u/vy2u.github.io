fab number two is it fit and number
three is it fun we're gonna find out
right now hello my friends welcome to my
fab food fun unboxing this is the fall
box I was very very excited to do this
video again because last time I did one
was I think not this past spring but the
spring before and it got a really good
response so I'm happy to do another one
that fit fun contacted me and asked me
to do a review of their box but you guys
know that I never never never accept
anything for review or for sponsorship
without them knowing that I'm going to
give an honest review so that always
says something about companies that will
send me things that they are ok with
honesty so that says a lot about
fabfitfun and I'm very excited to unbox
this with you I have peeked a little I
have to admit I have peeked in the
nature of honesty but I am still going
to tell you what I think about what is
in here and I'm actually quite excited
now a couple of things that you need to
know about that that fun it is $50 a box
comes four times a year but I will have
a of course I will have a discount code
below that will allow you to earn $10
toward your first box I do not receive
anything off of your signups which is
another way that you know that if you
want to sign up sign up man but I get
absolutely nothing from your sign up
which you get $10 off your first box the
benefit fund box always has over two
hundred dollars retail worth of items
this supposedly has $280 worth of stuff
inside it is full size beauty fashion
lifestyle kinds of things and now that
I've told you all about the box let's
get into what's inside and whether you
think it is a good box for you and
whether I think it would be a good box
for me if I had paid full price for it
so I'm always looking out for whether I
would be happy if I had paid full price
for this so you open it up and it looks
very very pretty it has a bunch of
different promo codes down here and if
it's okay with that that fund I will put
these promo codes down in the
description below so here there is a
little magazine and it says six products
in your box were created by women and
it's a little magazine and it just talks
about different things
April bucks artist was April ho it's got
all the comics in here and one thing I
was really really excited about is one
of my favorite youtubers is right here
her name is Amina moose I don't have a
say her last name but her YouTube name
is Studio Moochie and I will link to her
channel down below I love her channel
she is so stinking adorable all right
and this is what it looks like on the
inside lots of good goodies first we
have this glorious ModCloth discover
unique vintage inspired style and a
range of sizes it's a blanket scarf it
is so stinkin soft like really soft like
squishy li you can see it squishing Wow
I don't know how to wear scarves I'm
gonna have to watch some scarf tutorials
I'm always scared to wear scars but this
is really soft I will definitely try to
learn what to do with this thing oh my
gosh it is so cozy like I'm gonna sweat
my face off if I keep this on anymore
but it is really soft oh my gosh I'm
very excited about this hopefully I can
wash it in my washing machine because it
feels real fancy alright next we have
what are these toe socks made
exclusively for fabfitfun and I think I
read that these are supposed to be like
for yoga and I don't know anything about
toe socks if you know about toe socks
you have to clue me in oh your toes
actually goo your toes go into things is
that uncomfortable though and imagine
something going in between my toes would
be uncomfortable let's try them home all
right
there's my toe socks that actually
doesn't feel too terrible and it's got
grips on the bottom so yeah it says wear
a pair of these fitness socks when you
get a pedicure to keep your feet warm
and avoid smudging that's cool so you
like I guess you get like the whole
pedicure thing and then you put this on
when they're about to paint your toes
that's actually kind of smart I'm gonna
take it off because I'm so sweaty in
here oh my gosh it still feels like it's
summer here but those are super cute so
I'm already feeling like we're inching
toward that 50 dollar mark and I saw so
much stuff left okay
the brown guy
by Tonya crooks clear water-resistant
eyebrow gel okay this is my thing with
eyebrow gel it cannot smell bad and I've
not smelled this yet the question is
does it smell like alcohol because I
can't stand it when a brow product
smells like alcohol a little bit but not
as bad as the anastasi one it actually
kind of smells a little bit fruity I
don't know there's something about that
strong alcohol smell that gives me a
headache this has a smell to it but it
doesn't smell like alcohol so I don't
think I have brow gel on so let's try it
I want to see if it makes my brows feel
crunchy I can't see anything we're just
gonna wing it
no mirror makeup challenge okay well
give that a minute to set and I'll tell
you whether it's crunchy or not but yeah
so I'm excited to try this and use it
more this is cool so far so good Tonya
crooks nice job
all right next up the body oil French
lavender by mullion and Sparrow skin
firming hydrating antioxidant rich oil
is perfect for dry skin I do not have
dry skin but my skin does get drier in
the winter time and it says French
lavender I love the smell of lavender
before I go to bed so this will be
really nice for that oh I don't like
that there's no pump or anything here oh
and it smells like lavender but it's not
overwhelming it smells like it's very
it's not super super strong coz if a
lavender scent is too strong it can give
me a headache but it's not super strong
it's very light and fresh and crisp and
clean and I really like the smell of
that so this is gonna end up going by my
bedside table so like you know kind of
put a little bit on for a room of
therapy before bed and a little extra
moisture maybe on my hands or something
cuz that'll be really nice once it gets
a little colder outside so at this point
I think we might be past the 50 bucks
value in my opinion because I feel like
the scarf itself is worth at least
thirty dollars if not more maybe even 40
and then with the brow gel that's worth
at least tend to me it may be worth more
than that monetarily but to me I've been
the toe socks I'm sure are worth at
least 1015 dollars and then the oil
being at least ten to fifteen dollars so
I mean we're way past fifty dollars at
this point and I still have this whole
thing of stuff I don't know if you know
this about me but I am a
coffee drinker so joy comes in the
morning is what this says and it's a
really nice coffee cup it looks like
it's got a nice solid pop on it I am
such a mess I will sometimes not have
one of these cups and will actually
bring like a legit coffee cup in my car
so it's always nice to have an extra one
of these travel mugs and I'm excited to
have this this is super super super cute
next up the skin laundry California
restoring night serum always into trying
new serum serums not cereals serums
antioxidants vitamins and peptides help
reduce the first signs of aging I
already have a couple of the first signs
of aging so hopefully this will help
reduce that so this is definitely I mean
we are like head and shoulders above $50
at this point very nice fabfitfun you
done good you're done good alright this
is the cotton L for fat fit fun that
says hashtag sponsored that is cute that
is very funny because you guys know I
always put the hashtag not sponsored and
I can't do that for this video but this
is it says hashtag sponsored so it goes
well with this and what in the world is
this as baby wipes with the world
it says cotton L go commando Bayer and
clean cotton L I don't know what the
world is happening here
what are you flushable cleansing cloths
they're for your private areas when you
go to the bathroom so you can be a
little extra clean I've never used these
kinds of things I you know is that too
much information but I had a friend who
swore by these things so I'm anxious to
try them I think it's a great concept
I just never ventured into that land if
you know what I mean so we'll guess
we'll be venturing there this is way too
much information TMI
turn it off Jen turn it off all right
let's move on oh then we move into
stinky armpit and this is the secret
outlast clear gel completely clean I
think this is an extra bonus I don't
know I don't think that this was like
part of the box it's like an extra so
that's kind of cool I'm always into
trying new deodorants especially the gel
ones because then you don't get the
white underneath your armpits that's so
unattractive so super excited about
that and then oh my goodness are still
more stuff spun gel beyond cleansing
body wash infused buffer multi-use what
the world's this is a nice thick bag
though that's gonna have to be reused
here we go so it's one of those sponges
that already has soap in it I've used
these before and I really like them a
lot they're nice and convenient you know
you know a lot better for like really
fast showers
so you wet this it's already got all the
soap and everything in it and then you
just use it for multiple uses and 30%
off the entire store $5 flat shipping
code fabfitfun nice very cool I'm
excited to use this hope it smells good
oh it smells very girly and floral ooh I
like that I like that a lot very nice
man I am so impressed why don't I
subscribe to this box what is wrong with
me this box is amazing oh I thought this
was in here it's an eyeshadow palette
it's like pure cosmetics it's called the
nude collection mmm look at the nice
chin very nice boob it looks like you
know that that eyeshadow palette that
shall remain nameless that it looks just
like it looks a lot like that like
almost exactly like that like almost
exactly like that one let's swatch
though it feels soft it's kind of
powdery kind of chunky but it might work
well doesn't feel powdery in a bad way
just you know like little rock shadows
will like powder up that's the way this
kind of feels us like that kind of
powdery like there's just a lot of
products coming up like it's not packed
super tight but I'm not anti that I
don't think that's Chi bad
pigmentation looks amazing whew I'm
excited about this yes very nice nice
job here Cosmetics
20% off your order of $30 or more so not
only are you getting the stuff in the
box but you also get the discount codes
which is super awesome very cool I'm
excited to play with that more that's
very cool and then the last thing I see
in here is a nature coloring book with
some colored pencils this will probably
get passed to my little girl because I
don't really do a lot of coloring stuff
but she does
just got a lot of cute little you know
that relaxing adult coloring book kind
of thing very cute and then a set of
colored pencils
ooh so it comes with blue green purple
pink red and yellow inside so that's so
fun because these things are so popular
right now oh my gosh and to get one in
this box is super bonus so I think you
guys already know that genuinely in my
heart I feel like this is definitely
worth over fifty dollars and this is the
thing is I know people that watch my
videos are super smart so if this was
not worth fifty dollars y'all would know
about it and you would call me out on it
like John this stuff is not worth fifty
dollars but it really truly oh my gosh
like really fabfitfun did fantastic I am
so so stinking impressed so impressed so
we got the coloring boat we got the
eyeshadow palette we got the spongy
thing we got the girlie cleansing cloth
we got a really nice bag we got the body
oil lavender body oil brow gel deodorant
