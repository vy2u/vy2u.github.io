fabfitfun unboxing we're about to get
fab we're about to get fit and we're
about to have some fun so hang tight
okay maybe not we're gonna be fab we may
not get fit right this moment but we are
gonna have some fun I'm gonna unbox my
fall fabfitfun box this is sent to me by
fabfitfun
for a sponsored video I have done many
of these and you all seem to really
enjoy them one thing I love about
working with fabfitfun is if I'm like
you know honestly I didn't really like
this box they still send them to me
anyway which speaks to the awesomeness
of this brand I don't know whether I
like this or not because I haven't
opened it yet so let's go ahead and open
it together and as I open it let me just
tell you a couple of things it is a
quarterly subscription box this is the
new fall box
it's $49.99 but I have a code that'll
give you $10 off if you would like to
sign up for your first month I do not
benefit from you using the code it's
like a tracking thing for fabfitfun to
see people that came over from my video
but our payment is completely done it's
over so it doesn't matter I'm not gonna
benefit if you sign up for it but you do
benefit by getting that $10 off I think
my code is JG 10 something like that I'm
pretty sure it's JG 10 this subscription
is very lifestyle Fitness Beauty focus
so you get clothing items you get
Fitness inspired items and you always
get some kind of beauty item skincare
makeup things like that by the way I am
wearing my glasses today I'm having some
trouble with my left eye and I did not
feel like it was a good idea to put my
contacts in so you know sorry for the
glare I'm sorry if that's bothering you
also the light that I usually have on
this side it's raining out so there's no
natural light so the lighting might be a
little off as well right so into the
magazine the first thing in here is all
of the products I'm not going to read
that but then it just gives you
information about different charities
and lip looks you can do with I guess a
product in here member shoutouts things
like that so I'm gonna put that to the
side there is a card in here for UNICEF
it says children first and it
as a way to invest in every child's
future through education and where you
can take action I will leave that link
down below and then here is how it looks
on the inside it is very heavy this
month I don't remember it being heavy
previously so let's see what we got
first thing I see in here is something
called a cozy wrap it says travel well
travel often travel light is this a
blanket that you can use on a plane whoa
go from the plane to city streets and on
to dinner dress up or down the she crap
makes a statement wherever you go nice
oh it's not a blanket it's a scarf well
okay I thought it was gonna be one where
you could use it like as a little
blanket or you can but I guess you could
kind of use it it's just really skinny
for a blanket good good I know I guess
so it's a very very long scarf let's I'm
like dressed like it's summertime I'm
wearing my I'm wearing my supernatural
shirt so you know we're all summertime
doubt right now it's very soft feeling
it's like a wool feeling without the
scratchiness I look so inappropriate
right now like look at this how
ridiculous do I look in my tank top and
my giant winter sweater this looks crazy
but in the wintertime this is gonna keep
me very very warm it definitely feels
very high-quality it feels nice yeah I'm
excited about this
not for this moment but in a couple
months I'm gonna need it I also like the
colors I like that it's a more neutral
shade of grey I like that so win on that
for me we've got some more cuddling up
for winter items this is a beanie hat
and it's very thin it's not a super
thick one you might be able to wear this
because this is cute there we go I'm
gonna wear this for the video this is
super cute I like that I will wear this
I will rock this it is mine yeah I love
beanies I can never seem to find a
beanie when I want a beanie so this will
be an extra one just in case I can't
find my beanie and again I like that
it's black so that it can match with
lots of things sets cosets wire
heart ceramic jewelry holder hmm
named for a famous GM Olmec geometry who
believes Yama tree is intrinsically
linked to music featuring rose gold
metal frames with porcelain minimalistic
collection of jewelry holder and pencil
holders will hit all the right notes in
your home okay so it's got let's put
this baby together it's interesting so
this is metal and then this is ceramic
and you go like this cute very cute this
can go up here with all of my other
jewelry stuff this is cute this is not
something that I would have bought on my
own but I will definitely put some use
to it so I'm happy to have it but I
never would have purchased something
like this hey next up we have the deco
cuticle oil and it says lavender on it
deco Miami I think is the name of the
brand and as we get into winter my nails
do start to dry out so I do like to use
a cuticle oil as it gets cold out isn't
that cute that's adorable see how strong
this scent is ooh very very strong
lavender scent there I'm gonna put a
little bit on and see how it feels it
feels like a cuticle oil it feels nice
cool I'm happy to have that again
probably not something I would have
outright purchase but I am thankful to
have it and it will get put to use lots
of stuff in here this month ok so we
have the trusty clip this is in the
shade floor it's a fig I think I already
own this shade I'm pretty sure I do so I
will not be using this on camera
woah that's gigantic I feel like I have
a small one of this because I know I
don't have any bull's eyes then must
have gotten in a subscription box or
something and got in a sample because
this is huge
that is beautiful I'm actually gonna go
in my drawer and see if like oh it's
magnetic oh isn't that nice and then I
think there's a sharpener in the back oh
no it's a lip balm in the back well
maybe I will have to keep this because
there's a lip balm in the back of mine
are now lip balm I always smell is
lavender right now it smells a little
bit sweet mmm
see I don't know I might have to keep
this I don't know mmm I mean look and
see if I have Florence fig hold on a
second I knew it I do have Florence fig
it's right here and I will swatch this
one
for you instead of that one is a very
nice nudey pink shade and I really do
like this color a lot I don't think that
I'm going to keep that one just because
I already have this one and it just
seems a waste to open that and use that
but it is a really really nice lip
product they're very hydrating they
don't have a good lasting power or
anything no extra special staying power
but they are really good lip products as
far as just standard lipsticks they're
very nice they don't pull or anything
they're not extra drying they're just
nice lipsticks so next up we have a bag
here and it says private party shop
private party calm Instagram at shop
private party are we having a party
let's find out okay so this is it says
Jim and juice that's funny
okay so it's a bag it says Jim and juice
and it's kind of it's just a canvas bag
again this is probably not something I
would have purchased on my own but we'll
get use out of it's a useful product
it's empty on the inside and then it's
got a pocket on the outside right here
and it looks to be of nice quality
nothing super fancy but it definitely
seems nice nice enough I am NOT a gym
goer right now I'm still having trouble
with my foot where I can't do a whole
lot at the gym right now so I haven't
been going to the gym but if I ever make
it back I have a bag that I can use I do
have a bag I typically use but this one
is a little bit more compact it's not
quite it doesn't have as many features
on it so it might be easier to grab this
than the one that I currently have so
that's pretty cool and then here it says
Ice Ice Baby my hot and cold gel pack Oh
see I could use this for my broken foot
but you don't know I messed up my foot a
couple years ago and then recently my
idiot self dropped a like 30 pound
drawer right on my foot the one that's
been busted for a couple of years it
dropped on a different spot on my foot
but now my foots messed up again any
healing that I had before may be gone I
don't know but this will be very nice to
throw in my freezer and
my kids are always getting little bangs
and things like that so this is actually
something that I probably would have
purchased it's that's Ice Ice Baby it's
getting hot in here
I'm not gonna sing the rest of that song
either one of them but that's cool I
will definitely use this it says that it
is freezable microwavable and reusable
that's neat there's more products than
usual alright cotton L fresh care this
must be like an extra thing it's safe
flush technology so this is one of those
wipes that you can use to clean up your
downstairs mix-up I don't know if these
are safe to flush though it says safe
flush technology I don't know I always
get scared to flush this stuff even
though it says safe flush technology I
don't know I'm gonna have to look into
it to make sure I'm cool with with doing
that it says flush one or two clumps at
a time so they say that it's good but
I'm still going to do my own research
and make sure they're made by Cottonelle
and this is probably just like a bonus
item they threw in this is interesting
this isn't an apple cider vinegar hair
rinse shampoo and conditioner substitute
color locking technology gently removes
impurities infused with argan oil fire
tulip lavender extract aloe vera and
more well that's very interesting this
kind of freaks me out a little bit but I
will definitely try it it is cruelty
free and gluten free and fragrance free
I would imagine it's got some kind of
vinegar scent to it let me open it and
see because I am NOT a fan of vinegar or
vinegar scents my kids love salt and
vinegar chips me not so much it's a big
thing at the beach around where we live
to put vinegar on your french fries and
I do not partake in that it has a very
mild vinegary scent it's definitely not
as strong as I thought it would be so I
will try this I will give it a good try
and see how it works I'm a little scared
of this product I have to be honest this
is this kind of freaks me out a little
bit but I'm gonna research this a bit
and I am gonna try it you're supposed to
not expect the lather and you're
supposed to leave it in one to three
minutes can we use daily or weekly
okay all right we'll try it we'll try it
and then the last thing in here is by
wish it's a renewing mud mask that's
cool what are the ingredients look like
this first thing I think of is what kind
of ingredients is half water Kalin
magnesium aluminum silicon
sweet almond oil okay so it looks like
the best ingredients in here are the
sweet almond oil cap roulette capric
triglyceride glycerin aloe vera extract
aloe vera leaf juice and then anything
after that I'm not going to look at
because it's like like citric acid and
xantham gum and things like that so
anything after that is not probably not
a lot in it so I'm not super impressed
with looking at the ingredients of this
but that doesn't mean that it's bad or
anything it looks like this renewing mud
mask let us smell because we have to
smell everything smells like a clean mud
that's an oxymoron if I ever heard one
not really muddy it's more clean than
muddy but it just smells like clean
fresh skin care kinds of sense it smells
pretty nice but not like overly scented
it's supposed to renew purify smooth and
soften I would see that this would be
best for people that need hydration
because of that sweet almond oil maybe a
little bit of anti aging and then the
aloe vera is like a healing kind of
ingredient of hydration healing
ingredients so if that's you that maybe
this is something you might want to you
might enjoy I this is again something I
wouldn't have bought because I would
have looked at the ingredients and gone
man and not bought it so now it's
decision time was this box worth 50
bucks to me if I paid $50 what I feel
like I got my money's worth so the
things that I feel like I'm happy with
I'm very happy with the beanie
I love the beanie the beanie makes me
happy it says as beanies worth 49
dollars I would never pay $49 for this
beanie I would pay like 20 bucks for it
though 15 to 20 dollars for it I really
like the scarf even though it's
currently covered in packaging worms but
I will fix that I'm very excited about
this it seems super super warm very
excited because it does get quite cold
here if you live in a warmer climate
though that's not going to be useful for
you on 4
fortunately the hair stuff kind of
freaks me out I'm I'm gonna try it
but mmm the ice pack yes definitely for
me that's something that I would use the
lipstick if I didn't already own it then
I would say yes absolutely so I'm gonna
say this is yes I'm gonna pretend like I
don't already own it because I would
would have been very excited for this
and it is a great product the nail oil
now that I think about it more I do
think that I would have purchased this
because I do think I'm almost out of my
nail oils so this is a yes the jewelry
stand is a no for me I wouldn't have
purchased this even though I will get
use out of it and the mask is a no for
me just because I looked at the
ingredients and was not super impressed
I never would have purchased this again
I will use it but I'm not super excited
about this one oh and then the bag the
gym bag again I'll get use out of it but
I wouldn't have purchased this on its
own so for these products do I think
they're worth $50 to me yeah I feel like
they're worth $50 I don't know if I saw
them all on a shelf if I would have
picked it up and purchased it but I
definitely don't feel like I didn't get
my money's worth if I pay for this I
don't feel like I would think that I was
ripped off in any way I definitely got a
$50 value in products out of it of
things that all use but what you need to
do is you need to look and see at this
stuff and decide whether there's $50
worth of stuff in here for you or $40 if
this is your first box or fabfitfun with
my code that I do not profit off of
again do not profit off of people get
real sensitive about discount codes in
YouTube so I just wanna make sure I'm
clear what that thing does so I want to
thank you so much for watching and this
