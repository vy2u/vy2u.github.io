doing here
why are you even here I don't know I was
doing my own thing and you made me come
in I forgot I did didn't I
yeah that's your fault it's my fault it
looks funny when I go like this hello my
friends welcome to my fabfitfun editors
box unboxing I have invited John BAP on
the channel he hasn't been on the
channel in what like two years a long
time it's in a really long time but if
you've been around that long you got to
leave a comment below tell me what you
think about John's return I know that
you're excited because I know I'm
excited and you've never seen a video
with John in it you are in for a treat
come on man don't hype it though man I
heard but I shouldn't over
it's good you can always cut that out I
always kind of turns out sucky it's true
I can't go get it never mind yeah it's
been a while since we filmed with John
so he's gonna help me unbox my fabfitfun
editors box this is a box that's special
for new subscribers for fabfitfun they
did send this to me for review and this
is a sponsored video well constructive
criticism Kelly I can do a sponsored
video and be honest because this is the
thing I am always honest with this box
and if they don't want they don't like
my videos for any reason they can stop
sending them to me and they can stop
doing sponsored content how about that
Kelly did you know what's in it I don't
I don't know what's in it the regular
subscription is a seasonal subscription
it comes four times a year it is $49.99
but I do have of course uh discount code
down below I don't benefit from you
using the code but you will get $10 off
of your first box and this editorial box
is available right now and there are
some choice items in here that you will
get a choice over I did not get a choice
but you will get a choice I will make
sure
note those in the video description so
you know which ones you would have a
choice over if you do decide to
subscribe to this but since I don't know
what's in it I don't know which ones are
the choice items yet so look at the
description box for that information so
in this box we have fashion and beauty
and lifestyle products they're all
full-sized and it's monetarily over $200
worth of stuff but what it comes down to
for real for real is whether you'll
actually use the stuff in the box
because if you're not going to use the
stuff in the box you never would have
purchased the stuff in the box it's not
worth the fifty dollars alone two
hundred dollars so we're gonna find out
what's in this you can decide and I can
decide and we can decide whether this is
actually worth the fifty dollars of
subscription price so let's go ahead and
dig into it let's do it let's do it
alright you want to do the honors and
cut into it that's it that's it very
cutting I know it was super fast and
easy okay
so first thing in here we have magazine
thank you Vanna White look at that yeah
and that's what has all of the item
names in it and values and information
on how to use the products things like
that in there I'm not gonna look at it
right now
what's up doing all the fade-out
oh okay so it's a referral card it's a
referral card so when you get this
you'll have your own unique code you can
give it to a friend and they can get $10
off their first box that's kind of cool
something smells very rose scented in
this box and if you know me you know I
am NOT a fan of rose scent this might be
a repeat of stuff that we've gotten in
previous boxes cuz again this one is for
new members so I see some stuff that I
recognize from other boxes what is that
I don't want you to film this with me
there's no boy stuff in there there
might be boy stuff in here I don't see
anybody no well what about this it says
private party yeah privates and well we
all have privates honey
and this I believe is a tote bag oh I'm
just hoping it was a jeans court and it
says we'll work out four cupcakes I
don't know I like the other one that I
got better I forget exactly what it was
only another gym bag from them before I
did I got it but it didn't say this it
said something else I mean it is
cute I guess if that's your humor but
it's kind of I don't know I think it
encourages the wrong thing do you agree
I don't know I guess it's just it's
supposed to be funny
I won't use this I'm gonna find somebody
that pass this on to you see what's next
sure we got we got this don't see me boy
stuff this is the wish rosehip and Lotus
nourishing du masque
it's a du masque what did they do have
you used the du masque I'm trying to see
what it what it dews it's got a lot of
buzzwords on it it does paraben free
sulfate free phthalate free DEA and T
free t free why would you want T free t
is really good in cosmetics it's leaping
bunny certified that's good cruelty-free
leaving dude if yeah it was a cruelty
free a little cool t IV no it's not
vegan it's cruelty free the yeah finally
the Fountain of Youth see that already
makes me a little skeptical you've been
searching for dewy luminous moisturize
skin and now you have found it with a
wish nourishing du masque
intense hydration reduces the appearance
of fine lines and inflammation intensely
moisture you may have a baby what's the
ingredients let's say water glycerin
which is a humectant isopropyl palmitate
I'm not sure what that is anything
safflower seed oil cetyl alcohol shea
butter so this looks like it would be
very hydrating but I don't see a lot of
anti-aging stuff so far I'm gonna have
to look a little deeper in this it's a
pretty packaging you gonna put some on
Ted about quarter size know about dime
size but it's okay rub it in how's it
feel put it in your face it should feel
pretty hydrating I mean it definitely
seems I got some nice hydrating stuff I
feel dewy already my nose still white no
you're good feels good in the monitor it
looks like I have a big shine no it's
just cuz it's it's luminous I'm super
luminous now it smells good
mmm kind of smells like lotion in
English but it's not it's do you smell
it as is on your face no I mean it
smells like I just put
moisturizer on you know what I mean but
it's not like offensive or anything yeah
okay
I was hoping it would be more rosy nice
yeah I'm glad it wasn't that's not all
like rosy that's pretty chill okay this
is something we've gotten before these
are the sponge L sponges these things
are really cool they have the soap
already infused inside of them they're
really neat I bet you this is the rose
scent though everything raised that
one's really really strongly floral
that's the only thing I don't like about
this sponge l once I wish they did like
more sweet like cupcake II kinds of
cents Vanilla's and stuff like that cuz
that's my personal preference that's
really good because I don't like strong
flower sense do you like it I don't fret
that all over my body well then you
should you can have it at Jersey I
already got a bunch of new soap Oh
oh yeah I just got you a bunch of soap
for Christmas mm-hmm well maybe we'll
pass this on to a friend yeah maybe I'll
be good I don't know if it would be good
for Lila's skit or not yeah Mar 9 year
old I don't know I have to look at the
ingredients to see yeah may not be but
these things are really cool though
because you don't have to worry about
keeping putting soap into your sponge
and that's nice if you have like a
really small shower area and you don't
have a lot of space to like put stuff so
this is nice that you just have to worry
about this and not worry about any kind
of lotions use it until it stops being
sudsy yep and then if you want you can
even add extra soap to it to keep it
going but I usually like throw mine away
at that point because I feel like
bacteria at that point is in the sponge
and it's kind of time to be done with it
anyway so but these are really cool I
just don't prefer the scent let's see
we've got the real her real her playbook
this is an eyeshadow palette this looks
like it's the number two okay so there
we go and it looks like it's kind of
deeper Brown shades this is very pretty
this one reminds me of the one that's in
the two tart tart swamp Queen palette
that one reminds me of that one a little
bit I'm not gonna swatch this with my
fingers because I will probably end up
passing this on as well since I have a
lot of palettes that have very similar
shades to this so but yeah I mean it
looks very nice I don't know should I
touch it probably not I probably
shouldn't because I don't want to waste
it but
but it is very pretty for the right
person I think this would be really nice
for anybody of any skin tone because
we've got some deep shade some mid-tone
shades and some lighter shades no
lighter shade transition color so this
will probably be best for deeper skin
tones in my opinion what do you think
yeah man
turn away casinos all that stuff this is
by summer rose and it looks like jewelry
usually they include some kind of
jewelry item let's see what I got oh
these are pretty I really like these
it's a rose gold bar necklace it kind of
hangs down that closely I think it's a
necklace
okay a little mini nunchucks oh no
they're earrings it's not a necklace
there's no knees it's because they're
connected so my never would have thought
that they were earrings but it looks
like they're accidentally knotted
together which will be easy to unknot
but they're very cute little earrings
I'll totally wear these this is
definitely my favorite thing in the box
so far if I can get them apart you see
them they do look like little nunchucks
there are little nunchucks nunchuck
arrows FTW GW for the win no but yeah
this is definitely my favorite thing in
the box so far I will totally rock those
and then we have ooh this is gonna be
for you there's a guy item well this my
friend is not a guy girls are allowed to
have muscle that's very true like girls
do have muscles that's actually a fact I
read it on the Internet oh that's hard
that's uh yeah that's strong you think
you can eat it no don't oh my gosh yeah
you're gonna die don't do that no no no
no why would you do that you know wha
Rose well yeah it smelled like why would
you do that it'll babe this is this is
who I deal with all the time
here's the inside of it um I don't even
know what it's like a sour kind of
perfume scent I am NOT a fan of that Sun
at all maybe dilute it in the bath it
wasn't water right yeah you're supposed
to dilute it in water so I guess that
can that makes it so this so that you
smell it more because they put a ton of
fragrance in it that's a lot I feel like
I'm being so negative with this box but
this is the thing is that about four
thirds man because I don't sit lick it
this is the thing is everybody has their
own preferences and this stuff may look
amazing to you I'm so far for me I think
this would be perfect
okay well it's totally yours you can
totally have it I don't think he's
soaking them well you did your familia
net circulation you go put your feet in
at the end of the day oh it creates
warmth that's kind of cool patchouli
that's what I take it's the patchouli
cuz I don't like patchouli that's what
it is I know a lot of people love
patchouli I don't like patchouli that's
that's the part that probably tipped me
off that I don't like mm-hmm that's what
it is the patchouli hits you right right
yeah the back of the tongue so far
there's a few things than here if I
didn't have a huge makeup collection I
will be excited about the real her eye
this moisturizer is something that I
would use and then earrings so so far
we're doing okay not great
all right so this is very interesting
this is the makeup drop don't waste a
drop cruelty free non-toxic and paraben
free it's a silicone makeup applicator I
have used one of these in the past it
did not work well for me it just kind of
pushed my foundation all over the place
let me open it so you can see it I would
love to know in the comments down below
if you have tried one of these silicone
makeup applicators and whether it has
worked for you because this this whew
this is very thick this is your moment
so you're not rubbing into your fingers
and you're rubbing into your face
instead of putting it on a brush that
will like or a sponge that will get the
product it's it's supposed to just kind
of hair feel feels really good it's
supposed to be able to put the product
on your face you're supposed to Pat it
into your skin and this has not been
this kind of product hasn't been good
for me - that doesn't mean that this
won't I will probably try this and see
how it goes because this one feels quite
different than the one that I used it's
much thicker and it's very it's I don't
know it just feels better than the one
that I used before which was just kind
of some knockoff generic kind of brand
of it so I'm curious to try it out I
will give it a good college try so I am
excited to try a different version of a
make up sponge but I don't have high
hopes for it and then there's one more
thing in here and this I believe we did
get one of these this is called a cozy
wrap but basically what it is is it's
just a big fluffy scarf and it just goes
like that and it's just very cozy and
comfortable I mean you can wrap it like
a regular scarf but I think it's meant
to be worn completely out like that and
it's very soft and very warm and I do
really like the original one that I got
now that I've tried a little bit it's
very nice yeah put it around you it's
like a big hug would you wear that as a
dude I think that looks good on you no
no I have a big comfy scarf that I use
sometimes actually the one that I have
is not a scarf was called there you go
how did you feel one mm-hmm
they're very very soft and very
comfortable okay
so let's talk about what we got in this
box and whether you worth fifty dollars
if I saw this on a shelf for fifty
dollars would I buy it and I'm gonna
tell you right now I probably wouldn't
buy it for my personal tastes and my
personal preferences but if I had paid
$50 for this or $40 with code Jen love
that I don't benefit from you I would I
wouldn't be feel like I got ripped off I
feel like I would be enough stuff that I
feel like I got my money's worth for the
40 or 50 dollars I mean I am excited to
Trump retry this I hope that it's good I
do like the scarf because right now it
is flip and freezing out so anything
that makes me warmer makes me very happy
very cold outside oh I'm a cow that's
what it's called a cowl oh that's right
yes Wow look at you in your fashion
terms the muscles Seok is gonna be a
huge note for me but if you like the
smell of milady notice a huge nose
because it said I would not be able to I
feel like exhaust sound like this if I
if I took more baths but every once in a
while I'll take a bath you know I'm like
super sore from training or something
like that yeah well you could put your
feet in it at the end of the day if you
wanted to make a little bowl and put
some of this in there and soak your feet
it's supposed to be warming but that
would be nice and try it out okay sounds
good the the bag I'm not a big fan of
do you like the style of it I'm just not
a big fan of the saying but I can see
why somebody would think that that's
super cute but that's just not I don't
know I feel like working out is hard
enough as it is
and I guess cupcakes is something that I
have a lot of trouble not eating so when
I'm working out I don't want to think
about cupcakes and that's just me
personally so the saying is not for me
but I can see why somebody would think
that's cute and it's a cute bag the
moisturizer seems like it's very nice
it's got some good ingredients including
shea butter which is ingredient that I
really like so I would definitely use
this nice to look dewy you do you do
still look a little dewy comment below
if I still look doing the earrings were
super cute this was the biggest win for
me was the little bar earrings the
sponge L I will probably use but this
isn't something I would have purchased
because I don't prefer the scent and the
eyeshadow palette I personally wouldn't
have purchased because of the shade
selection but if I wasn't as big of a
makeup addict like I said I probably
would be excited about this so overall I
do feel like it's worth the forty to
fifty dollars but I would never have
purchased this if I had seen this I
wouldn't have spent my money on it so
you just kind of have to decide for you
whether this is something that you would
want to spend your money on and if you
do you can use my code or feel free not
to or search online for a different code
if you'd rather again my payment with
fabfitfun is completely done I don't
benefit from your signup so it's totally
up to you what you want to do not trying
to influence you in any way yeah I mean
personally I think that there's for some
people there's value and kind of just
getting something cool in the mail and
getting new stuff to try so people
unlike you that don't get these kind of
cool boxes to open up and try I feel
like they probably have a very different
perspective on these kind of boxes than
you do
absolutely so yeah I think that's where
it comes into play where it's like you
know maybe you wouldn't have bought it
because you have such a wide variety and
such a fleshed-out selection of products
but for people that don't have as big of
a collection right you know I'm like I
feel like these kind of boxes are kind
of cool yeah they're fun because it also
you don't usually know what you're gonna
get like I didn't know what I was gonna
get so it's kind of fun to open it and
what
yet from my present this month or this
quarter yeah yeah fine so oh and the
scarf I really like the scarf some has
to go really nice I mean if you're
talking about like money-wise like
something like this in the store is
probably 25 bucks yeah something like
that I'm sure that bet on the brand the
value I'm sure is a lot higher as far as
what they tell you in the magazine but
did these to acknowledge it I love these
two things are worth to me $35 $40
probably for these two things 35 maybe
I'm more than that for me personally
well yeah if I saw these two things
together for $35 I would buy them that's
that would be stupid cheap for those two
items I never though but I don't think I
would spend $40 on both of them though
that's just me maybe I'm cheesy
maybe I'm just cheap I'm probably just
cheap well thank you so much for
watching this outfit fun video I hope
you enjoyed seeing John in a video I
would love to include him in more videos
because he is a lot of fun to film with
and yeah so we'll say goodbye to John
for now and Matt I'd love to you we're
talking about filming more videos mm-hmm
yeah we just have to come up with ideas
so if you have any ideas of videos John
and I could film together we're totally
open to suggestions you want to know
yeah we do a Q&amp;amp;A video the two of us
that'd be interesting you just say one
those I did do not one you months ago no
I want to know about me I'm boring no
you're not you're very interesting he's
a very interesting dude John if you do
not know owns a tattoo studio a very
reputable awesome tattoo studio so we
were thinking about doing what was it
like a tattoo frequently asked questions
like a wat how not did you get a stupid
tattoo or how not to get a bad tattoo
like tips for getting a making sure you
get a really good tattoo yeah I mean I
think I feel like that it's like that
could be a whole series yeah my tattoo
education but it's whether it's
appropriate for your audience or not
yeah I have to like figure out what the
audience wants to know you know or what
they don't know her yeah will be helpful
yeah I don't know man well if you have
any questions about tattoo stuff you can
leave those in the comments down below
and well maybe we'll add those into
video or that we've thrown into like an
FAQ or something like that if you're
interested yeah what kind of gauge it
and see where it goes
yeah I know a lot of people are thinking
about getting tattoos this time of year
with tax season coming in and everything
you know people each season coming up
people are looking at getting tattoos so
if you have questions about tattoos you
can leave those or questions about
fabfitfun because that's what this video
is about I'll try to answer them as best
as I can but anyway thank you again so
much for watching and mad love to you my
friends and I will see you we will see
you in a video very very soon
so so far I've got two things that I
that I would use that I like well
actually this thing if I didn't have a
huge makeup collection I would probably
be really think they're not gonna able
to hear me if you're doing that I'm
doing a Satmar bro but okay about this
j4 loves these things
well great you like to pop them a lot
