the 15th fabfitfun and Springboks I've
seen in my own feed I know okay so this
is kind of how I'm feeling in this
moment about fabfitfun first of all I do
really like the subscription I am a
fabfitfun partner which means that this
is a sponsored video I've been getting
fabfitfun for at least a year maybe two
years maybe even longer than I'm getting
fed that phone for awhile they miss
sponsoring video my videos on my channel
for a while but I think the market is a
little oversaturated on YouTube so I'm
debating whether I am gonna keep
reviewing this box it's really gonna
depend on your feedback on this video
what I'd love for you to do is depending
on whether you want to see these boxes
anymore I give you 100% permission to
dislike this video if you don't want me
to do these box reviews anymore but if
you do like them if you do enjoy them
please give this video a thumbs up so
that I can decide whether I want to keep
doing this because I don't mind getting
rid of sponsored content on my channel
if people are genuinely not interested
but what I do ask you to do before you
hit that thumbs up and thumbs down
button and giving me feedbacks in the
comments is see if the way that I'm
doing this is helpful for you I mean
give you a rundown if you've never seen
fabfitfun before it is a 50 ish dollars
like 49.95
a month subscription it's fashion
Fitness wellness lifestyle kinds of
stuff I do have a discount code that I
do not profit off of it's just for
tracking to see whether they want to
continue to send me the boxes or not my
payment with fabfitfun is completely
finished at this point but you do get
$10 off of your first box if you do
subscribe without me rambling any more
let's go ahead and get into what is in
the spring box because it I personally
think it actually is a really good box
the first thing you'll see when you open
your box if you do decide to get it is a
magazine and this month they did include
all of the prices and the items which
always makes me very happy because then
I can share that information with you
this right here is an eye mask what you
do with this is you put it in the
refrigerator and it becomes cold and
then it's supposed to be soothing on
ize they say you know cold can help with
the puffing your eyes things like that I
find this one to be quite inflexible and
quite tight but it is very cute and I do
like the cooling effect but I do find
that it's it's a little bit stiff for me
for what I like for face vast it does
have an adjuster on the back but I still
find it to be a little bit uncomfortable
to wear just for me personally but it is
adorable what I've bought this generally
no I would not have purchased this and
next thing is something that's really
cute that I'm actually going to bring
with me to New York this week this is a
bag by Rachel pally and I do think that
I would have purchased this if it was a
little bit less expensive I don't know
if I would have paid the full retail
price for it but I love that it's
reversible I think that that's super
cute and it's very springy and adorable
it seems to be a very high quality I am
this is coming at the perfect time I'm
taking the train up to New York to go to
the glam masters premiere party and I am
so excited to go and excited to have
been invited so this is gonna be perfect
for that I bought myself a navy blue
jumpsuit so this is going to go
perfectly with that I wanted something
that I could ride the train and
comfortably so very excited about this
it's got faux leather on the back and I
think this is really really cute it's
got a separate little pocket on the
inside and I'm very thankful to have
this I for me this almost makes the
entire value of the box I'm I am very
excited about this by the way you still
can purchase this box if you do like it
and you do think that it's worth the $40
and you've never subscribed before you
can still purchase this exact box there
are a couple of choice items in there
but I'll mention those when I get to
them this one comes in three different
patterns and I'll put those different
pattern choices up on the screen now so
you can see which one you might get
personally I think they're all really
cute next up we have the Korres body
butter and this is actually one of those
choice items I probably would have
picked this over the other choice item
which is the KNC beauty all natural
collagen infuse lip masks I have tried
those before I don't find them to be
anything magical called a topical
application of collagen there really
isn't a lot of evidence that it actually
does anything so this is what I would
have picked so I'm thankful to have it
let me put it on my hands it smells like
coconut but it's not that obnoxious
smell of coconut that I find too
obnoxious I know some people really like
it but I don't like the smell of suntan
lotion it it smells very nice and fruity
and a little bit coconutty but it's not
like saturated fake coconut it smells
more like genuine fruits than artificial
which I really like it's very very
hydrating it feels very good I probably
wouldn't have purchased this just
because I do already have a lot of hand
lotions but if I didn't have a lot of
hand lotions this would be one that I
think that I would purchase because it
does feel really good the ingredient
base is it starts with water then
Sottero alcohol which is a good alcohol
and then we have sweet almond oil as the
major ingredient so if you have a nut
allergy you do not want to get this
glycerin which is a humectant it brings
moisture out of the air into your skin
cocoa cap relay which is texture I
believe based out of coconut oil I'm
trying to find another sunflower seed
oil is next and then it has squalene and
it which is really really nice some
people think that comes from shark liver
it doesn't necessarily a lot of times
now it's artificially made and then shea
butter is in here I know some people
don't like shea butter avocado oil
things like that but I personally really
like the way this feels at this point I
can barely feel it on my hands now it
doesn't feel super greasy so this is
definitely a win for me but again I
wouldn't have outright purchased it but
I'm thankful to have it next up is the
ish lip palette now this is something
I'm actually not going to use because I
don't personally enjoy lip palettes I
don't um when I put on lip product I
like to be able to bring the lip product
with me and for me a little it just
isn't functional so I haven't touched
this I'm actually gonna put this in for
a future giveaway probably is like an
add-on bonus for a giveaway but it does
have some beautiful colors that could be
used by many many skin tones which I do
really like you've got this light shade
here which is very nice because then you
can mix it in with the other shades and
kind of make your own custom lip color
so that's one nice thing about a lip
palette but I'm just not into them it
does come with a little lip brush but I
think which i think is very considerate
and nice to have that in there for
travel it seems very sturdily made a
sturdily a word it very sturdy it's
sturdy
I don't know if sturdily lowered the
clip closure on here is very very strong
so I think that this will be really nice
to throw into a purse I doesn't seem
like it would be something
would open up it's got a beautiful large
mirror in here I think it looks like a
very nice product for the right person
it's just not personally for me next up
I want to show you the lifestyle item
which I'm actually also very excited
about I spent a lot of time sitting up
at my desk on my computer and my
shoulders get very very tense I actually
scheduled monthly massages which is a
luxury that I pay for it they swear to
me it's not a luxury but for me I feel
like it's it's very expensive to get
with monthly massages but I feel like it
really helps me to get less headaches I
was getting really bad headaches for a
while I used this a little bit on my
back and it feels so good it's a very
light pressure on back I don't even tell
you what it is I'm just going on this is
the physique 57 massage roller you can
use both hands and kind of get your neck
and roll it around your neck which feels
like I'm getting chills right now it
feels so good and I kind of I always get
tense like right up by my scalp so I can
really get at my scalp right here and I
can even run it on my head oh my gosh
that feels so good and one thing I
really like about this is it's not super
intense where I feel like some of these
kinds of things they're just too sharp
where this I feel it feels really really
good and I think this pushes it over for
something I would definitely have
purchased this box between the purse and
this I mean like now that I tried it it
feels amazing I have to tell you it
feels amazing and it's my favorite color
welcomes to do I have to keep doing this
video because I could just say here do
this all day
oh look so on the back of this I just
read this this is really neat physic
physique 57 now offers bar classes on
demand see results in just eight
workouts free two-month trial visit on
demand physique 57 calm and enter promo
code fab 18 so you could even do that if
you wanted to I don't think they know
the difference whether you're fat fat
fun subscribe or not but you want to
check that out you could totally get a
free trial pretty cool I don't know if
I'm gonna do that because I don't know
if I'm flexible for a bar anymore I'm
not flexible at all I think I'm like one
of the least flexible people on the
entire planet you snake dance four days
a week when I was in high school and I
still couldn't do the splits
I'm just not flexible let's move on from
there I got stuck in that for a little
bit because it was just so super
fabulous this is another thing I really
like it's very very me this is the Maia
rather Los Angeles necklace and it says
love on it and you know love is just
kind of my thing Jen loves reviews just
love in general is just it's always been
I know this kind of sounds kind of
stupid but love has always kind of been
my word you know ever since I was in
high school I just I like to I just
think love is just such a beautiful
wonderful thing and anytime you can show
people love it makes world of the world
a better place I'm actually gonna put
this on and show you the length of it
it's just oh it's a bracelet oh I
thought it was a necklace oh man
I didn't actually try this on yet but
I'm gonna put it on my wrist because
it's just so pretty okay
I don't think I'm gonna be able to put
this on all by myself but I don't
usually wear bracelets but I think that
this one's special in that I just I
identify with this so much and I'm happy
to have this I'm very very thankful with
the love bracelet it's actually one of
those choice items so there are some
really cute earrings I think I would
have chosen the love bracelet but I
would not have been mad about the
earrings I'll put a picture of the
earrings here that you could have gotten
they're super cute too but I think I
personally would have chosen the love
bracelet so good job fabfitfun on
knowing what I want or I've just got
lucky I don't know next up they did
include a bonus item this isn't
considered part of the box it's it's an
advertised product this is the Dove X
file exfoliating body polish brush
macadamia and rice milk this is another
thing I haven't opened yet let me open
it up and just smell it and I hope I
don't spill it because I want to tell
you what it smells like number one
ingredient is water and then glycerin
and then hydrated silica after the
fragrance is macadamia seed oil so the
ingredients are not super impressive
it smells like like vanilla butter it
smells good let me just put a little
tiny bit on my fingers it's a very sandy
grit to it I would imagine that would be
very nice in the shower but I wouldn't
expect this to give you a lot of
hydrating results I think this would be
more of an exfoliator than an actual
body hydrator and if you're sensitive to
fragrance stay far away from this
because it looks like there's a lot of
fragrance in here skincare item in here
there's always a skincare item this is
the Murad skin perfecting lotion and
did look a little bit into the
ingredients of this this is a
lightweight oil-free moisturizer
provides shine free hydration for a
blemish prone skin with honey extract
and natural humectant I really like
Honey extract in my products I have
found that they do wonders for my skin
as far as anti-aging I do not have
blemish prone skin so this is again
another thing that I'm going to pass on
to someone that does they can get more
benefit out of it but I did look into
the ingredients a little bit there is
squalene in here again there is retinol
in here so this is going to be something
you would want to use at night or make
sure you use sunscreen if you do use it
at night either wash it off in the
morning or make sure you put your
sunscreen on over top of it when you
wake up everybody should probably be
using sunscreen anyway there's something
called trehalose in here which is
another really good ingredients
taurine betting those are all really
good things so this does look like a
pretty legit awesome product but again I
am going to pass it on to somebody that
I think would benefit from this more
than I do I have a select group of
friends that just constantly get stuff
from me so Fran this one's for you two
more things in here we got a candle we
do get candles occasionally I personally
really like candles what I'll usually do
is I cook dinner I clean up dinner and
my reward for cooking an awesome dinner
and then cleaning everything up is to
light a candle that's that's what I do
but this is a fresh linen candle it's my
husband's favorite scent as fresh linen
it is in this metal tin here but other
than that it's not anything fancy or
anything it smells like fresh linen like
a typical fresh linen candle and I'm
happy to have this again not something
that I would have purchased but I will
definitely use it the last product is a
nail product and this is by Sarah Molech
cosmeceuticals and it is a nail makeover
let me show you the box so it's got
quite a few claims on here it says
brilliantly concealed nail imperfections
successfully fill in ridges strengthen
weak brittle hard to grow nails and
treat acrylic or gel damaged and nails
I'm so mad at myself because I had this
on my desk to put all my nails last
night to at least give some kind of
first impression and I completely forgot
to do it so what I did was I just put it
on one hand just to see how it went on
it went on
very thin very smooth and clear like
glossy I am very interested in this
product to see whether it works or not I
will be using this and I'm excited to
try it I don't know if I would have
bought it but I again I'm very very
happy to try it and I'm thankful and I
do feel like it increases the value of
the box because I'm a person that is
very very hard on my nails genetically
my grandmother gave me her nails and
which I'm so so thankful for
she has incredibly strong nails she's
always had very naturally fake looking
nails like really long she's my only
grandmother that I have left and she is
an amazing person I would love to
introduce you to her one day she is
fabulous she's her name is June and
she's a dancer and she's incredible but
thankfully she gave me her her strong
nails genetically so I am very very hard
on my nails my nails are chipped mess
right now because I just haven't been
kind of neglecting them but they grow on
their own without any need for
strengthening however I do get a lot of
dings in my nails so I think this would
be really really nice to kind of cover
up some of those dings to make my nails
look a little bit more perfect I can't
speak to how well this works
unfortunately because I'm an idiot and I
forgot to try it but I am really really
excited about seeing this in the box so
overall I mean I think I've already said
it I do think for me personally this is
well worth fifty dollars forty dollars I
feel like is a steal for this stuff and
if you've seen my fabfitfun unboxings
before you know I do not say that all
the time there's definitely been some
boxes where I was like no they you know
no but for me I mean this is definitely
a yes for me the ish palette is a no for
me the massage roller is a yes this
thing is only twenty dollars so if you
see one of these in the store if you
want to buy one online if this was the
only thing that looked good to you I
definitely recommend picking this up on
its own because this thing is pretty
stinking magical the purse I'm so
excited about this because like I said
it came at the perfect time the bracelet
I'm really excited about the hand lotion
I'm happy to have wouldn't have
purchased it the Murad I wouldn't have
purchased because it's not really meant
for my skin even though it seems like a
legit product for the right person my
husband's gonna love this candle again
happy
that wouldn't have purchased it for me
just these two products alone are worth
$40 adding on the bracelet and the nail
treatments I'm very very happy with
fabfitfun this month and I and like I
said in the beginning even though I do
love getting this box for free and I do
love getting paid to make these videos
if you don't like them if them if
there's so many a lot of people that
don't like them if this video doesn't
get a lot of views if you're not
enjoying them I will stop doing fab fit
final I'm gonna go with the majority on
it so let me know your thoughts in the
comments below it just feel like
fabfitfun is way too oversaturated on
YouTube at this point and I don't like
to do the same videos that everybody
else is doing it's not who I am it's not
my style and I don't care if I lose
money over it it's not worth it to me to
put out content that is boring you know
what I mean
thank you again so much for watching
this video again please leave your
feedback with the thumbs up and the
thumbs downs down below giving me a
thumbs down isn't going to hurt me
overall it's just gonna give me an idea
of what you think of these videos the
comment section down below to give me
feedback on fabfitfun in general and
what you think of my videos that I'm
creating for these which format do you
