butterflies in my stomach because I am
so scared of shooting this video I got
this product I guess it's a product
whatever you want to call it this
contraption on I think it was Black
Friday and CBS was having 20% off and
I've wanted to try this for a while but
I'm absolutely terrified of it so I got
the it see it's even still in the CVS
bag I got the curl secret by Connor if
you haven't seen this before
basically it sucks your hair up and like
eats it for a minute and then curls it
and then lets it out and it's supposed
to give you this like magical curl so I
did not do my hair except for to
blow-dry it and I'm gonna show this I'm
so scared
oh but I figure we could lift through it
together and it will be worth the $80
even you know if it doesn't work just to
experience this with you my friends
because I really like you people and if
there's anybody I want to share this
with it's gonna be with you guys so as
you can see it's still in the packaging
it even has a new curling iron smell so
this is what it looks like I'll tell you
I'm scared of I'm scared that it's going
to suck my hair up and it's going to get
so stuck in there or it's going to burn
up or something really horrible is going
to happen to my hair but last time I saw
someone have their hair set on fire by a
curling iron she ended up getting like
five hundred dollars in like hair stuff
from Ellen like that chick with the
curling iron you guys see her like a
long time ago it was a gone viral I'll
link it down below in case you haven't
seen it it's pretty pretty terrible but
I just don't want to be that girl you
know like even though she gots going
Ellen and everything I just don't want
to be that girl oh okay I'm gonna pause
this work with but focus in I've got the
instructions I'm not going to be that
person that's too proud to read the
instructions so basically it just says
your hair should be dry and clean hair
goes in curl comes out it's that simple
oh do the lower layers first clip some
hair out of the way so I'll do that for
spirals or title tighter curls choose a
high heat setting of 10 or 12 for looser
wave do eight or 10 so I'll move it up
to 10 but it doesn't say low or high
which one you should use I'm going to
start with low because I'm scared
alright I'm gonna let this stop beeping
stop blinking and then I'm gonna put my
hair up and I'll be right before I do
this let me give you a quick little
story on my hair you can see I don't
have very much hair there isn't a whole
lot there after I had my son I lost a
lot of hair my hair got very very thin
I'm currently using Nioxin to try to
stimulate some hair growth and I'm going
to do another video on that after I've
been using it for a year I've been using
it about 6 months but I'm gonna do a
video on that that's a whole other story
but as my point is as you can see I
don't have a lot of hair this is half of
my hair altogether this took maybe 3
minutes 3 or 4 minutes to heat up oh my
gosh that sounded so scary
alright I can set it on my lap it's not
it's a little warm like here it's a
little bit warm but it's not bad this
side is completely cool so I'm gonna
send on my lap like that please no the
styler must be positioned onto the hair
with the opening of the curl chamber
facing toward the head and there's a
picture oh my gosh
I cannot believe I'm about to do this
okay alright here we go okay like here I
guess I'm gonna know her a little bit
woman okay put it here and then okay
it's beeping at me why are you beeping
at me
it just keeps beeping at me oh I did it
oh it sucked it up it beeped at me boy
let go whoa okay so curled a little bit
I don't know I don't know did I do it
right I forgot to read what to do once
it's in there that was a total fail
Gregor girl me this looks so much easier
than it actually is okay let's try again
whoo okay now let go I don't know woah
what's smoking
not good it's smoked okay but I'm
supposed to hold it like I do with my
new me I hold it let's say oh it worked
oh I can see my curve okay all right
let's try the other side I'm only gonna
do four well maybe five we'll see let's
try the side okay so let's try this
again I'm still like I still scared to
death of this thing okay let's try again
whoo totally sucked it up how the deeps
am I supposed to wait one two three it
doesn't say gosh four no am I supposed
to like hold it
cupping the curl how's that that's not
bad
okay so now I'm gonna release we release
the top release the goofy top bun like
this side I am NOT hair person can y'all
tell I am NOT a hair person at all okay
so let's do this piece right here
oh okay ready set go oh it's still
freaking me out
1 2 3 4
I'm scared I'm gonna burn my hair off
hmm see it's smoking it's I don't think
it's supposed to smoke maybe I should
just do 3 seconds
it's curling though it's definitely
curling see this is what I don't get
hair people like oh maybe I need to clip
the bottom piece out of the way so that
doesn't interfere with the top piece I
think it's looking really pretty though
yeah I'm getting a little less nervous
now it's not beeping I'm just gonna lie
to goat scaring me I'd stuck it stuck up
okay that was a fail and it's burning
okay
that did not work that one did not work
and it's like my hair is getting stuck
in it my hair is burning inside of it
it's like smoking stop it stop eating at
me okay it's still beeping at me don't
do that to me you're scaring me
mmm what is it doing
oh it's stuck it's not get off my did it
burn it off I hope you didn't burn it
off no it didn't burn it off
I'm not curling that piece anymore I'll
do this piece over here cuz I sell more
videos I want to shoot tonight my hair
looks like do to you you guys are gonna
know why two three it's not beeping at
me anyway that's what's freaking me out
because there's beeping at me before see
this is this is not success here I'm
going to do one more in the back and let
it be done with this crazy contraption
I'll do my review for you when mounts
beeping at me again I must be doing
something wrong on those side pieces
because that one worked something must
happen like if it doesn't beep at you
maybe I'm doing I did something wrong
because that one definitely worked I'm
think I'm just gonna have to play with
it more but it's definitely not
idiot-proof because this idiot
definitely messed up a couple he's
corrupt
alright I'm gonna put some spray in it
and then I'm gonna put it out with my
hair hold on okay so I grabbed my style
sexy hair spray clay I got this in a
beauty box and I was like whatever this
thing's gonna suck but actually really
liked this stuff a lot so I'm just gonna
spray all right want to kind of come
through I have a mirror back behind that
that's why I'm looking um yeah I don't
know what do you guys think it's okay I
guess it's a little different you know
what it gave me it gave me kind of like
beachy waves you know I'm saying but I
don't know it's not what I was expecting
but again I had it on the lower setting
I was freaked out by it I've never used
it before so I'm going to give it the
benefit of the doubt that it is going to
get better than okay so so I thought I
thought it was done but I'm not done
because I decided to take the pressure
off myself and go off camera and try to
do this again so this is what I'm coming
up with and what I'm learning is that
you have to make sure it's not too close
to your head because that was what was
happening with the beeping thing how it
wasn't beeping I think it just couldn't
get a good grab on it and that's why the
curls weren't working so let me show you
what
I'm doing differently this is just you
know a couple minutes after I shut off
the camera so let me put this back in
and see how I'm not going to go that
close to my head anymore
and see how it's working now it's
totally working
and there comes the curl it's totally
working now it's just it was totally
operator error so I cannot fault the
product for me being not knowing what
I'm doing here so I'm just going to pull
this last piece and then I'm going to do
the same thing and cut and um you know
style it or whatever okay see now it's
working because I'm not getting so close
to my head okay alright so that's much
better as far as the curls
I don't know but see like I'm lopsided
here what is this what is this piece
this piece is not right oh my gosh I'm
so terrible at this so that one didn't
work it's not beeping oh it's stuck Oh
what that stuck thing really freaks me
out I don't want to go on Ellen like
this see it's still not it's not beeping
so I know it something is wrong there
because it's not beeping let's try this
piece see I thought I figured it out now
I feel like I'm I didn't figure it out
because I'm not putting close to my head
so what I'm learning is if you don't
hear the beat take it out immediately so
it doesn't burn your hair off all right
let's do the spray clay again and this
sides had longer set so I'm just going
to run my fingers through this see that
looks that looks good I like that that
looks good
my fingers through this side this decide
I kept messing up I don't know do you
think I can shoot videos looking like
this you look it's all flop sided I
think I just needed to put some more
love in this I'm gonna put some more
love into this side and I'll be right
back okay my friend this is as good as
it's gonna get
I think I actually really like it and
again like like I'm trying to tell you
is I think
it really is operator error I don't
think that it's the products fault I
think that if I just practice out it I
will get better at it but I did want to
give you a first impression because if
any of you guys are like me and terrible
with hair then I wanted to give you an
accurate representation of whether this
may be a product for you if you're
really good at hair and you're looking
at me like man that girl's such an idiot
then this will probably be the product
for you because you won't go through the
same problems that I'm going through
you're probably yelling at me through
this green gen what are you doing you
know like in this ah but you know I mean
I'm being real here was and this is
really happening in summary this is the
con air suck your hair up and curl it
machine also known as the curl secret I
hope that this was a helpful review for
you if it was make sure you give it a
thumbs up down below and hit the
subscribe button if you want to see me
make a complete idiot out of myself in
the future but love and I'll see you
