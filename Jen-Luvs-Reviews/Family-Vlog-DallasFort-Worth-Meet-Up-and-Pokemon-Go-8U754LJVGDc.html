we slept in the car last night and I was
so sleepy
this guy is a machine he's a machine
we drove till what what time wasn't 5:00
you drove till 5:00 in the morning
that's Texas time
Alma
a 20 Texas time
and we're back on the road I fell asleep
right
or I know that I saw
Albuquerque's Albuquerque was cool
that was up for at least an hour after
Albuquerque but I don't think I made it
all the way
I don't think I did I remember you
saying that we were in Amarillo and you
were gonna keep driving
so where are we now we're at Wellington
we're coming up
Memphis Texas I know there was a Memphis
Texas and now I know you learn something
new every day
little man is still sleeping
little girl is awake little girl fell
asleep before a little man so
the re
we go
sound like a plan
this was a tough one this is a tough one
and we are gonna have a meet-up today
nor the Dallas we're not going to go
into Dallas because the political
climate is not fabulous down there nor
the Dallas not too far from Fort Worth
there's a Sephora
so it's kind of halfway point between
Fort Worth
so we're gonna go to Sephora we're gonna
be up and I'm pretty excited about
alright so we made it to spring what is
it spring lake spring something what's
it called South Lake who made it to
South Lake
Town Center and all the shops around
here the meetup isn't until 6:00
it's shortly after 2:00 we got here
super early because John drove like a
lot so we are gonna go over to Claire's
and get Lila some new earrings she
accidentally lost one of her brand-new
earrings at the Grand Canyon so we are
pretty sure we would never see that one
again we looked we spent some time she
was really sad about it but we didn't
want to spend another twenty dollars on
a pair of silver earrings we wanted to
get some less expensive ones for her so
we're gonna go head over to Claire's and
get her earrings so it turns out there's
gonna be no makeup for this Meetup I'm
still wearing the same shirt I was
wearing yesterday cuz I slept in my car
and it's a classy Meetup
what we saw like 25 people playing come
on yes we have discovered Pokemon go
until apparently is everybody else in
Dallas why can't you do Pokemon why
can't I do Pokemon like you can do it
later I'm gonna do right now hold on a
minute I'm vlogging so it's kind of
addictive and I can tell my husband's
already starting to get annoyed by it
because you know staring at a screen and
not paying attention to what's going on
really bothers him so we're gonna try to
limit the amount of Pokemon that we're
playing but it's just really funny to
walk around and see everybody around you
with their phone out like walking around
looking at their screen and like
capturing pokemons
I captured like five down at the dungeon
yup over there I captured like five
uh-huh hurry up I think everybody that
walks by is doing it
yeah everybody that has their phone out
is part is pretty much fun
yeah it's kind of crazy so we're waiting
for Russia to get here Russia is an old
friend of mine from my old youtube
channel that I had back in 2006 I did a
video competition were like
up-and-coming youtubers and Russia was
one of them and it was called battle of
the YouTube naan stars and I did that I
think it was like 2007 so Russia was
actually one of the contestants in the
show that I did so it's been a really
long time coming me meeting her and I'm
super excited as far as I know there's
only one other person coming to the
Meetup and her name is Jennifer this is
Raja who I've known since before my
children were born I look at how big she
is I know my god and you watch the vlogs
the vlogs and she was in my belly yes
yes I remember that and used to do
cooking I remember a baked potato yeah
that was a baked potato there was a big
potato I don't why was so badly I showed
you how to make a baked potato because
in a microwave it's because I was so
fancy you've got to be convenient
exactly exactly it was like cooking for
dummies pretty much man but it's awesome
I can't believe that it's been how many
years of it I don't know 2006 six Exeter
setup maybe before seven because I
graduated from college in 2000 so I
started YouTube in 2006
okay then I must have been too tough
2006 so that's longer years ago
and aside so we are gonna go find some
food for the kids it's about an hour
until the official meet up so hang out
for like an hour and then we're gonna
keep back for to see if anybody shows
okay come on she drove all the way over
it so you gotta come see it so that I
cannot plan these meetups on my own what
I've learned because so what I've
learned is that I need somebody from the
city to help me figure out where these
locations to me should be because it
seems like I did not pick the best
location at the best time and because of
that we don't have very many people and
that's okay because I am thankful for my
friends and we're able to make it and
went out of their way to come hang out
with me so you already met Russia a few
minutes ago and then this is Jennifer
who came out and hung out is hanging out
with us and we are gonna go shop in a
Planet shopping we'll probably go wander
and support for a bit wander around and
yeah and we'll see you guys a little bit
all right
so meetup is all done so we are now
headed to Louisiana we are going to stay
somewhere in Louisiana right across the
line so we're not going all the way to
New Orleans yet so we're on our way
dropping something so this is the
shopping center we spent the day in in
here all day it's a very nice little
shopping center it's kind of fancy
schmancy but it's nice it's really nice
little atmosphere they got going on here
we just ate at stuffers restaurant and
bar snuffer's nut stuffers checkers it
was excellent and our server was awesome
his name was what Trevor not Trevor
Tyler his name was Tyler and he was
awesome and we had a really nice meal
and now the kids want to go run around
the fountain a little bit before we head
out so we're gonna go do that and then
we're headed to Louisiana to say I'd
looks like Greenwood Louisiana something
like that we are headed there we have
some activities there planned in the
morning and then we're headed to new or
so it is 1001-a p.m. and we are driving
into Dallas looks like a big city right
yeah Dallas not a year ago we actually
just got here we're just driving into
the city now it looks pretty it looks
pretty but it looks a lot like Baltimore
actually oh look at that big building I
wonder what that is
there's a big building ahead I think
it's huge
nope it's not the white house the white
house is in Washington DC I wonder what
that is it looks like maybe a stadium I
don't know
it's crazy-looking what is that
Oh what does it say on it it says stream
I don't know office building we don't
look like that typically oh look how
pretty
so if you've never been to Dallas this
is what Dallas looks like at 10 o'clock
at night what's up yeah definitely has
bigger buildings and more of them
everything good blue in Dallas
ooh there's something lit up in front of
us

prettiness
oh okay oh look at that rainbow building
