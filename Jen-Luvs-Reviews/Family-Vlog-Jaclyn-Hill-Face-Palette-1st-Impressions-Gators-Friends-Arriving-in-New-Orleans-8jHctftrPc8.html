excited always want to go to Louisiana
I've always thought there would be a
really fun place to visit especially New
Orleans so we are headed to New Orleans
today or New Orleans or New Orleans or
however you want to say it but before we
do we are going to a place called Gators
and friends and it's like a petting zoo
/ Gator thing and it's got really great
reviews online so I'm super excited to
go there and for the kids to go there
it's sounds a lot like we had gone to
bear ozona with all the Bears and the
wolves and things it sounds like it's
gonna be similar to that but alligators
so we'll see how that goes before we
even go there I want to tell you about
what I use in my face today based on the
products that I bought and brought to my
trip so the first thing I want to talk
about is that i bought this mac paint
pot in vintage selection i bought this
at the mac store when I was in Kansas
City and I'm really really liking this
so far let me see if I can show you what
it looks like kind of uh me show you
it's like a shimmery base so that's when
I put all over my lids and then over top
of that i use the Loreley palette by
violet vols again because I only brought
two pallets and I really want to test
this out because of all the negative
reviews for it and I'm not feeling
negative and I like okay let me just try
a bunch of different shades and see what
I'm missing here so what I did today is
I did use mama bird again in the crease
best of um before the one from the top
and you can see it went on really really
easily and very very nicely on my skin I
do have air conditioner by me but this
is where the best lighting is so i
apologize if you're hearing a little
from the air conditioner okay so then
all over my lid i use larlie which is
the first one on the second row that's
really what you see all over my lids
then in the outer corner I used the
shade fried a little bit which I had
never used before it's almost got a
green undertone it's like a brown like a
fried chicken kind of look
so I put that in the outer corner with a
little bit of whiskers which is the
second one on the bottom kind of scroll
doubt in the outer corner and I really
like the way my eye look came out today
I mean of course you do have the
interaction of the mac paint pot which
may make a difference but I wanted to
use a lot of different products with
this and I'm really liking it oh and on
the lower lash line I have fried from
the center out and then whiskers just in
the very outer corner for my cheeks I'm
using again my Becca Jacqueline Hill
palette and what I'm noticing is that I
really do love the application of these
products but just like all Becca cheek
products I'm noticing they don't last a
long time on my skin so we'll have to
see how this makeup lasts in the
Louisiana heat I did use the
Pamplemousse shade which is that bright
bright pink I kind of toned it down a
little bit in case you can't oh I turned
it down a bit but I use the Pamela
mousse and then i use the Prosecco pop
on as the highlight and then for contour
i use my smashbox contour palette which
is the only contour palette that I
brought and then finally for lips today
I use my new bare minerals liquid
lipstick in the shade friendship this is
a matte liquid lipstick formula I am so
loving these oh my gosh there's gonna be
a full review on these and the lip
glosses once I get them from ypsi if she
had the point system for ypsi they had a
bunch of the lip glosses and I got seven
lip glosses so we're gonna try those
we're gonna try them on and I got three
of these liquid lipsticks at Sephora
with my money let me tell you the best
thing about these liquid lipsticks the
best thing is that you open it up and it
smells like a snack pack like I'm not
even kidding it smells like chocolate
pudding I don't know why they're not
advertising that it smells like
chocolate pudding so the formula is not
drawing at all well I can't say at all
it's got the slightest bit of drawing
this of course there's no tackiness at
all and the lasting power is really
really good so I'm still testing them of
course but so far oh my gosh I'm really
really liking these that is it for the
makeup and we are going to pack up and
get out of here and head to gators and
friends so we'll see you things we're
walking up to alligators and friend
for the less epic than big Arizona what
I said it looks a little less epic
embarras out of that doesn't mean it's
not an amazing inside here take this so
there's alligators and we're going to go
over to that pavilion that's where
they're feeding the alligators and we're
gonna see if they can hold a baby
alligator
