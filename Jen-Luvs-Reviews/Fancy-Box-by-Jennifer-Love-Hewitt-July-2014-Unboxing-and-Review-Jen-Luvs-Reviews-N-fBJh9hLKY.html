here's your one chance pants and I'll
lam it down here's your one chance pants
at all and down hello my friends welcome
to my very first fence a box opening
this is Lila if you haven't met her
smiler she's just eating snack eat
watermelon and I figured she could just
join us in the video and she could let
us know what she thinks of the stuff in
the fancy box fancy box I actually would
wanted to order a fancy box I was like
hey maybe they'll send me one for pro
bucks I want to email them and they said
sure we'll send you one for promo I
tried to get two for promo but they
didn't go for it so I try to get one for
me and one for John that didn't go so
well so they just sent me one they sent
me the jennifer Love Hewitt's box and
it's designed by jennifer Love Hewitt
and she picks off the products every
month to go in the box they have a bunch
of other ones too I'll put a picture of
all the ones that are available right
now here so you can see which ones are
available now they're always changing so
fancy box is 47 dollars a month with
shipping okay I don't know whether they
ship internationally or not if I figure
that out I will put it down below so
it's a little bit pricey but it is
designed by celebrity so I guess that's
part of the reason why it's so expensive
hopefully there's some really great
stuff in it I have seen the jennifer
Love Hewitt box unbox before and it
looks in some videos on YouTube and it
looks like it's got a it's a really cool
box a lot of times in jewelry and stuff
like that looks super girly so I figured
it would be perfect for me and we'll see
whether Lila thinks it's a perfect box
to so we're gonna go ahead and open it
and see what's inside
popsicles I know right and we got this
big old fancy envelope and let's see
what's in here we got a fancy popsicle
sticker and we got a fancy another
sticker and then we got a little
thank-you card
hashtag fancy d fancy Instagram Twitter
and Facebook and opening up this paper
crunchy crunchies more crunchy crunchies
and then I pull out this and this says
Jennifer Love Hewitt fancy box on it and
it's got the products inside I'm not
gonna look at it unless I need to first
thing I see you I look at these it's
burger it's a burger it's six tasty
table coasters and you get a bun lettuce
tomato cheese burger and another bun
I'll have the works let's see what these
things are like oh it's pretty good it's
it's for when you have a fancy schmancy
table and you don't want it to get
ruined by having a drink on top of it
you put put it on a coaster and they
feel very papery ah but we get the bun
we get the burger thank it looks real
here's some cheese yes tomato lettuce
fun bag I think those are only gonna be
under finger toy for Lila you want to
play with those you can have them
they're just like paper real thick paper
or coasters okay interesting okay you
weren't ready to see what's next yeah
alright okay this is this is cool this
is a Sileo premium fondue set
Oh what's fun do you ask fondue is when
you take chocolate and you melt it in
this thing here or you can take cheese
and then you dip the food in it you do
Blahniks
yes oh the you know the fondue maker
Apple this is a real fondue pot is Islam
this is cool we make plenty
hey maybe well we got to have some
chocolate to melt or some cheese to melt
yeah we do well we'll have to look and
see whether we have meltable chocolate
and cheese so it comes with this nice
ceramic pot here okay and it's got four
skewers with colored bottoms which is
nice and you don't get your skewer mixed
up with anybody else and then you get
the bottom the base hey that's cool and
then you put a candle I believe
underneath like a motive underneath to
heat it which is cool that included
candles doesn't look like it no candle
included wow you think they at least put
a votive in here this these are cheap
yeah we have a candle but it would be
nice and liquid in there and then the
directions are not in English I do to
you but they're definitely not English
but it shows you the picture how to use
it I know it now okay well we can work
on it together that's kind of cool so
okay well you've done it in the air so
that's all you need
yeah alright let's see what's next what
is this this stretched ribbit yeah for
hot pots and dishes
it's silicon let's say like silicon is
like a rubber you put your hot pot on
the on the silicon II thingy and that
keeps your counter from getting bird
yeah I'm not really excited about that
I'll use it but it's definitely not
something I ever would have purchased
five my favorite thing is cool though
okay and then the last thing here
there's one more thing and it is a calf
in half way to do you see that if this
is funny look at this thing
wait till you see this it's utterly
resistible irresistible irresistible
irresistible irresistible look it's got
odors in there look can you see that I
have to zoom the Sun look see look
that's the bottom of the cow you know
where the baby cows drink out of
that's the little utters where the baby
cows drink oh so you put the cream in
here and then you pour it out yeah like
like like the baby cow just come up and
drink out of that area no that's really
silly
I can't imagine Jennifer Love Hewitt
would pick this like I didn't know that
about her that she would pick something
like this I see a lot you feel the
utters you can't go in there
yeah that's where you put the cream here
okay all right I'm gonna put some milk
in this you guys can see it and I'll be
right back be funny okay so this is how
it looks filled up you can lucky you
coming back in okay alright so this is
how it looks filled up isn't that silly
that's just straight-up goofy I just put
milk in instead of cream because that's
what we had but that's just food for you
Lena but so for 47 dollars
we got the fondue bar maker which is
definitely the best thing that we got
one we've got the creamer utterly
awesome creeper Harry we got the trivets
for hot pots and we got the burger
coasters so though I am very thankful
it's a fancy box for sending this to me
I don't personally think that I would be
happy if I had paid forty seven dollars
for this actually you know we see if it
says the value of these things in here
Lana isn't that what it doesn't um but I
can imagine I'd be able to get a fondue
maker for less than forty seven dollars
the coasters are cute but I probably
wouldn't a brought him the trim that I
definitely wouldn't have bought and the
creamer thing I definitely wouldn't have
bought so
I'm not so impressed with this
particular box that doesn't mean that
they're all not very impressive there's
a ton of different options over there
once in that mouth well we'll find it
we'll find it in a minute okay stop do
it hey did you eat it think that was
real and you ate it now so I got Kelly I
think you ate it
no yes you get that burger piece you
thought it was real
yeah there's lots of different options
over there I definitely recommend you
check out some of their previous boxes
there's a lot there's a few openings on
YouTube there's some vlogs that covered
it and see whether fancy box would be
something for you I am very thankful to
have it I'm happy we're gonna have a lot
of fun with our fondue maker and yeah
yeah we're gonna have fun I think maybe
you want to try to do that tonight yeah
yeah we'll see if you can't maybe we'll
text daddy daddy's at the grocery store

cheese and we'll split some bread
