new guys sub mini sub 1 sub that we
wanted to show you the gentlemen over at
Fashion Stewart contacted us and asked
if we wanted to do a review of their
subscriptions so we did get this as a
promo box but we promise it will not
influence our review at all and plus you
guys are smart enough to know you know
whether it's good or not anyway so yeah
so we do not have a promo code or any
kind of affiliate links or anything for
this we're just going to show you what
it is for your own personal information
but we will put a link directly to
fashion store comm if you would like to
travel there to sign up for yourself if
it's something that looks interesting to
you so fashion store ik is a monthly
subscription company you pay $75 a month
right now we noticed on their website
they're running a special at 65 bucks a
month
similar to 5'4 where you go on you fill
out a style profile you tell them what
you like which don't like you tell them
your sizes they ship your items you keep
what you get that they have a really
long return policy 365 days Wow so you
can return it within a year but there
are there's a fair amount of language on
there that says it must be an unwarned
condition tags attached nope pet dander
or you know other plant you know so I
don't know anybody who's gonna keep
something laying around for a year
that's gonna be in you know unborn you
know good kind of like as received
condition because you know you have a
piece of clothing laying around the
house and get some dust and things like
that and it's not you can wash it so
yeah but you can send it back if you
don't like it do you send back the whole
thing or you send up one item word you
know all orders can be returned for
refunds or requesting a refund you must
send them back the entire package with
all of the original items by requesting
a refund you may be subject to
cancellation of your mem
we hate to see you go as a member but if
we cannot satisfy you we'd rather not
give you the hassle so they're like yeah
you can return it but we might just not
send you stuff anymore so I'm not sure
if that's always the case but that there
is that language in there I'm sure like
the first time you know they can kind of
email them and talk to him about it and
be like hey you know this didn't really
you know this wasn't really my style can
we try again bah bah you know and try it
and see if they'll go for it but I would
imagine if you keep sending stuff back
that it's just not something that you
would want and they're not trying to eat
the coffee
either I'm sure it also sends you can
you can do size exchanges as well oh
that's good please note that we will not
accept items that were sent to you with
sizes as stated in your profile at the
time but now that we're on that subject
I will say that I got a nice little
handwritten note in the top here this
says John we thought you'd like to try a
fun casual blazer the Henley runs big so
I pulled you a media enjoy happy styling
so they said hey man you said you wear a
large but this actually fits a little
different so they're they're being smart
about it
and I tried the shirt on and I'm
definitely glad that they gave me a
medium it fits it fits really nicely
yeah are you I've been too much so they
they want to make you happy they want
you to keep the stuff so I'm assuming
they're gonna do whatever they can to
make sure you get the appropriate sizes
yeah I'm sure and obviously this isn't
you know their policy or anything but
just from from my perspective I would
think that a lot of that language in
there that sounds strong is is there to
protect them just in case there's
somebody abusing their privileges right
yeah so let's go ahead and get into what
you got for the sixth sick bull right
now $65 subscription price yep okay so I
open up my boxes try not to hit my head
Jennifer this time I open it up it's
just got some tissue paper and then it's
right here
so the items that I got are some fancy
socks I have a blazer and this is a
Henley and so we'll pull these out I
almost lost my head but I didn't oh my
gosh did we're getting better
yep van coochie no that's what not very
this is a Vannucci casual couture we're
not fancy one one thing that Y didn't
say that
one thing that should be noted is you
guys see me in all these videos I'm a
pretty casual dresser but I do like to
dress it up a little bit when we go out
and so this clothing subscription seems
like it would be good for somebody who's
trying to kind of class up their look a
little bit sharpen it up a little bit
is it a socks venucci Couture and these
are hand looped oh for ultimate comfort
mercerized cotton socks Dericks they're
big they're high socks so there's that
and they match well with the Blazer and
the Henley so we'll pull out the Henley
first this is purple this never seen
them wear purple like that ever
yeah I don't know I never think that
purple looks good on me your eyes the
green and the purple nice contrasting
colors so Brad this is a medium this is
60% cotton 40% polyester made in
Indonesia and yes it's got three buttons
on the top here this is definitely more
of like a like a like a heavier weight
Henley it's not super lightweight nice
it feels thick yeah I mean nothing
nothing crazy
pretty pretty predictable as far as as a
Henley goes and then the next item that
I got is a Kenneth Cole blazer this is
in a size 44
R and the reason why they know my coat
size is because they have you fill that
out on a style profile so they actually
they do get get those measurements so
they know when they're sending you
Blazers and things like that
that they will fit and I was a little
concerned when I first got it you know
sometimes I do have problems with the
fit on on Blazers and things like that
and the shoulders and things like that
but this bet fit really nicely
yeah I don't think I ever would have
picked that out for you but it did look
really nice in you I like the way it
looks
yeah I'm not gonna say that they like
mailed me style-wise like because the
items that they sent me are definitely
different than things that I would
typically wear and things that I think
that I kind of alluded to in too and in
my style profile like the stuff that I
like but that stated again this is a
company that you subscribe to because
you want you know some fancier stuff you
want to kind of sharpen up your wardrobe
a little bit and for a guy like me you
you need somebody sending you that stuff
or you need somebody putting it on you
and saying hey man you look great in
this you know so I think that that's
kind of a benefit there this stuff that
they sent me it fits well I do like it
so I you know I could definitely see
myself wearing it and I think it's going
to be a matter of for me the confidence
and wearing it kind of comes from you
know other people's reaction and even
worn it out yet yeah I'll just find out
yes so I want to show you the length of
the soffit on I want to show them the
length of the socks look see that's how
long they are
they're like mad long that was all and I
wanted to like just like do this I don't
know make like finger puppets or
something like not finger puppet someone
to make some puppets you need a little
eyeballs they're like Cirque de Soleil
he's trying it on for you
all right so this is the piece this is
the blazer with the shirt underneath it
I like it I always want to show my chest
off because I got all these tattoos so I
don't know I think that this would
probably be better off buttoned up so I
don't throw you out of the classy
restaurant nice I mean it's nice and it
has like all kinds of nifty pockets in
here you notice something's fancy when
it has a bunch of pockets so it's got
likes nice pockets on the inside it's
actually got a got a little like cell
phone pocket in the bottom here too
which high-speed which is I mean but
like for $65 or even $75 I feel like you
couldn't get this jacket for less than
50 or $60 I mean even on sale at like
you know more
Scholz or something like you wouldn't be
able to get this jacket for cheaper than
50 or $60 there's no way so I feel like
that the just the jacket alone is worth
the subscription price because it is a
nice it's a nice jacket and then the
shirt I would say you know you wouldn't
be able get that for cheaper than $30 at
least 30 $35 and then the socks are what
at least 10 bucks
you know I'm thinking like bargain
prices like bargain you know when you're
trying to get this stuff for cheap so I
mean there this is a really honestly
it's a really good value it's just
whether that style is for you or not
whether you're into dressing up or not I
think it's going to be the hit or the
miss for you whether this would be good
or not but I definitely think the values
there yeah and they're definitely like I
said they have if you go on the website
they have a bunch of examples of things
that they sent out in the past so you
can get an idea when I was looking at I
definitely had a good idea that they
were gonna send me something a little
dressier a little fancier so it's cool I
mean it all fits oh we go away no no
again you know I think that the purple
is a little weird for me I don't know
how you feel not as good I like like the
ladies love purple so not ladies lady
one lady that's all we need to worry
about I hope all the rest of my ladies
love the oh you'll have the purple bags
you're like the purple I do like the
purple all right there you go there we
go thank you to the gentleman over at

outfit we really appreciate it it was
