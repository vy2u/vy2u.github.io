video for you today a subscriber of mine
her name is Virginia I will put her
channel name down below she contacted me
and from one mom to another her daughter
has an incurable form of epilepsy and
November is epilepsy awareness month and
she asked me if I would make a video to
spread awareness according to her
epilepsy claims more lives each year
than breast cancer epilepsy in general
effects 2.2 million americans every year
it affects 65 million people worldwide
and people don't really talk about it
you know you see all of the breast
cancer awareness which is fantastic you
see a lot of autism awareness which is
fantastic but we don't see a lot of
epilepsy awareness so I wanted to
present that information to you in a way
that I can present it and then give you
some makeup information along with it so
purple is the color for epilepsy
awareness just as pink is the color for
breast cancer awareness I figured I
would do a video on my favorite purple
products there we go perfect purple I
almost feel kind of inappropriate
because epilepsy is so serious and I'm
such a goof and you know now talking
about makeup and makeup is so not
serious compared to epilepsy but you
know I mean I gotta do something review
wise to go along with it so here come my
favorite purple products first I want to
start with two nail polishes and the
first one is one that I'm wearing today
and it is by SE and it is in the shade
smoking hot and that's what that looks
like there it is a deep deep purple
color almost like a great own purple and
it is absolutely gorgeous it is a 2 co
polish and I absolutely love this my
second purple product for nails is this
one bike julep and I know there's a big
thing against jeweled because you get
very little products with them in the
bottle but this one is so so stinking
cool it is in the color Julia and I
never would have picked this for myself
but on it looks so cool and i don't
think the bottle does it justice it
almost looks gold in the bottle i don't
know if you can see it because the glare
but let me paint it on my pinky nail on
top
of the current purple it's not going to
be the same as if I had applied it alone
of course because it is over the purple
but you can just see the gorgeous
shimmers in there I'll put the
description there as far as what julep
says that this one is but it is just so
incredibly beautiful I live in the
Baltimore area and the Baltimore Ravens
are huge around here and this is the
color that I always wear whenever the
Ravens are doing well and everyone goes
oh my gosh look at your ravens nail
polish and I don't even care about
football but people happen to love this
polish serving football season moving on
to I products the first one I wanted to
show you is this one this is a cream
shadow by Mary Kay and it is so stinking
gorgeous I'm actually wearing it today
all over my lid and i absolutely love
how opaque this shadow is i mean just
the sheen on it is just so beautiful and
this is a really nice all over the lid
single color shadow and that's one of
the reasons why i absolutely love this
this is in the shade violet storm now
one that I don't like quite as much but
I did feel like a deserve dimension was
the maybelline color tattoo in lavish
lavender now this one is not opaque it
looks like it when I swatch it on my
hand but when I put it on my lid it
definitely is not opaque you can see
it's a little bit more of a blue tone
then the Mary Kay one but you really
need some kind of white base under this
or you need to pack a shadow on top and
order for this one to work in my opinion
but I did want to mention it because it
is I think it's still available I don't
know is this one still available I don't
get a lot of limited edition stuff in my
area so if it is available that pic you
might want to pick this one up but just
know that you're going to have to add a
shadow on top or you're going to have to
you know put some kind of base
underneath it all right for powder
eyeshadows I have this one by laura
mercier and this is a single shadow and
violet sky this one is absolutely
gorgeous i love this one on top of my
transition color you can see it's not
glittery but it does have a little bit
of a sheen to it it's right there just a
really really nice multi-dimensional
purple color finally my favorite purple
eye shadow of all time and this one is
by bare minerals and it is
and passionate plum and the big reason
why I love this one is because a lot of
purple eye shadows will turn kind of a
gray color once you put them on your
lids this one stays true purple and I'm
going to be super careful with this
that's what it looks like in the pan I
don't want to spill it because I'm
notorious for spelling these things I
know that there I love loose powders but
I hate that I spill them I'm going to
put that one over here because that's
where I have room and it is a matte
purple and it's just absolutely gorgeous
so just to show you those swatches again
this one here is the bare minerals
passionate plum this is the Mary Kay
violet storm next to that is the
maybelline color tattoo lavish lavender
and then over here is the laura mercier
in violet sky I forgot to top of my
purple liner oh my goodness alright so
another purple product I wanted to show
you is the Jordana made to last liquid
eyeliner pencil this thing is amazing
check out the creaminess oh the
creaminess this stuff is awesome doesn't
last in my waterline but it's really
nice for lower lashline and upper
lashline love it this is in purple fix
it is cheap and it's awesome so now I
got to talk about even though its many
many many hours later go back now to
daytime ok now for lip products i'm
going to kind of cheap because i don't
like straight up purple on my lips my
friend laura over at mrs. lola lynn
loves purple on our lips she's blonde
and she's gorgeous and she can handle
the purple i personally can't handle
purple on my lips but they do have a
couple of purple products that well once
purple and one is like a poor Polly like
a maulvi kind of color so I'm kind of
cheating a little bit but it's new so I
want to share it with you first one that
I wanted to share with you I actually
got from my friend Ava over at Ava's
beauty talk I want to give away on her
channel and she added this as a bonus
and I was so so so thankful and this is
by revlon and it is in the color lilac
something pentel i don't know i'll put
the name right there because i can't
really read it it's really really really
teeny but by itself I don't really enjoy
it because it is no it's okay by itself
but it's just not my style but what I
like to do is take other colors and
layer this
over top so like that's it by itself and
if i take this red this is this is red
label by Milani and this one here is
sultry which is one of my favorites
favorite lipsticks of all time it's my
covergirl randomly and I absolutely love
this color can I these of course aren't
purple but when I layer this over top so
there's the the red label and there's
the sultry and watch what happens when I
layer over top see how the colors
completely change so if I want to make
this a little bit more balut something a
little more blue tone a little more
purple tone or if I want to cool
something off it's a little too warm
I'll put it over top just so you know
kind of what I do with this and I do
really really enjoy it for that purpose
the last one I wanted to show you is a
brand new purchase and is the Maybelline
Color elixir and I'm wearing that today
and I know it's not purple it small but
I really like it i want to share it so i
got it stretched stretch the envelope
here to put it in this video i know they
kind of started off with the YSL
glossies things i think is what they're
called sucks it had these petal-shaped
applicators this one's like fuzzy it is
so soft on your lips it feels so good to
put it on it's like getting a hug from
your lip product it's crazy and let me
show you how that swatch is there i mean
just absolutely beautiful and you don't
need a lip color under this it's not
sticky it's very very smooth and i just
love this formula it is so fun i want to
get like nine more I do I love it I
absolutely love it I did try the l'oreal
version of these and I hated it I
absolutely hated it so I'm really happy
Maybelline came through and made a
really good formula in this kind of
elixir line alright so those are my
favorite purple products again please
keep in mind at people with epilepsy and
spread awareness for finding a cure for
epilepsy there are so many people my
friend Virginia her daughter is nine
years old suffering with epilepsy and I
can't imagine from a mother to a mother
watching them go through that it must be
absolutely heartbreaking to see them
going through that and I just totally
feel for her if you would like to spread
awareness for apple
the awareness month I encourage you to
also make a video of your favorite
purple products or a purple eye tutorial
or somehow spread awareness to your
subscribers and viewers if you do make
youtube videos it is a fabulous cause
and I I support it and I really hope
that more people are able to make videos
to spread awareness for epilepsy and I
thank Virginia for contacting me and MA
and give your daughter and the rest of
your four children big hugs for me and
thank you so much for watching if you
