good no that's not why that's good it's
perfect yeah I'm not perfect I do not
like sitting me know yeah well what else
do you want to do anything I suggest
pelo you don't like sitting on the
pillows but you're so short
hello my friends welcome to our very
first citrus lane unboxing jon was the
only one in the family not getting a
subscription box so we wanted to correct
that and now we've got John a citrus
lane box and this is the first one i
will put all the information on how much
citrus lane costs and all the
subscription options down below we do
pay for this one out right it is not set
for promotion I got lots of them yes I
bought you six of them so I got six
months and then we're going to decide
whether we want to keep it or not so
he's already unboxed it so he's going to
be giving you his opinion of the things
that are in this box okay yes but are
they sing things going in and the other
boxes no every month is different
everybody's different yes but I think
they'll have the same thing no they're
all going to be different things inside
why so that it's not boring you got the
same thing every month they'll be boring
are you ready to show them what you got
this month yeah okay all right let's go
ahead and open it up and he kind of
ripped the paper a bit inside but it has
this nice yellow paper why don't you go
ahead and pull something out this is the
card of course a lot of subscription
boxes have this card that tells you what
everything is okay what is that John
it's something that can help you tire
shake exactly it's called the lacing
skate from cape I think is the way you
phonetically pronounce this I don't know
if that's actually how you pronounce it
it looks like it is not an American
brand so it's probably pronounced a
different way so the bottom of the box
was shattered but it doesn't really make
a difference to us so what it is is that
you get the skate so it's got the holes
on the bottom here and then you can snap
that on and they can play with it as far
like oh they can play with it as like a
little car it doesn't stay on there very
long as it is staying on there pretty
well and then they can practice lacing
there's a little velcro here they can
practice putting the tie on and as a
I really love this because of the fine
motor benefits of it you know teaching
him how to manipulate laces is very good
for the pincer grasp which is good for
writing so as a mom and very happy with
this John do you like this you like this
gate yeah you do okay what's next buddy
can you show what comes next those are
really really cool these are called
magnette it's a magnetic block set from
tegu and it's just magnetic blocks now
we've already misplaced one of them of
course we only have three it came with
four and you can take these and show
some examples of how the child can build
them but this is a really nice purse toy
you know when the kids are waiting at a
restaurant or waiting wherever and
there's you know not anything to do this
is a really good toy for him to play
with can you hold it up and show them
how it works wounded up so they can see
it and then take it apart so they're
magnetic block so that way the blocks
aren't flying all over the place they
can make them stick in different ways
they can practice with attracting and
repelling the magnets because there are
positive and negative sides to it so
that's really fun those those are
definitely a big win we really like
those a lot so again as a teacher and a
mom very excited and happy with those
all right you ready to show the next
thing you want to show these next okay
these are flip them around so they can
see the front what do they call John
they're called sour sour beans and those
are they came with two packs and they
are so this is the one he already ate
there by young earth naturals no gluten
dairy not soy artificial colors or dies
and they're they're definitely
undeserved but that's okay it's just a
little bit I did you want to try one for
them and tell them what they what you
think of it okay so let's try one oh
yeah them but okay okay all right go
ahead grab one okay show them and that's
what they look like they're kind of like
sour patch kids coming but in jelly bean
form pretty good mind that i just ate
with peach what flavor did you get
and Pete peach tune I'm not gonna bet it
looks like there's three different
flavors there's a yellow and orange and
a red the last thing in here was a book
and this book is called I could be you
could be basically the way that the book
goes is I could be a dolphin swimming in
the sea and this I could I could join
the circus as a topsy-turvy clown you
could be an Arab pony prancing up and
down and it just rhymes like that
telling you all these things you could
be and then the end the last page is or
the best thing I could ever be is me and
then it shows the kid just being him or
herself in the back there's an activity
for making a mask yeah nice yes you can
have the rest can you share one more
with Mama I'm just going to just one
more and then you can have the rest you
give it to MoMA and go so how happy are
you with your citrus lane box a little
bit happy what's your favorite thing in
the box they've got that yes camera
beeps this our beans were your favorite
did you like the magnets the magnet
blocks did you like the lacing shoe
lacing skate yeah you don't really like
it why not because it's not because we
couldn't because you don't think you're
10 you would like it if your foot
actually fit in the shoe okay and you
like the book yeah you like the book
okay so the should the lacing skate was
a little bit of a Miss for you hopefully
he'll warm up to it when we first opened
it he was excited about and then he
realized his foot to infinity was kind
of bums I think he's just a little
confused as far as the purpose of it but
we'll play within will practice with it
and we'll see whether he likes it more
later you don't think he will no okay
