video of the month my monthly favorites
and fails countdown where we countdown
from the worst product I tried this
month all the way up to the best hang
tight we're getting into it right now
okay so I've got so much good stuff for
you if you've already feel like you've
seen this look yes you have this is the
third video I'm filming with this look
because I'm a little behind and I wanted
to make sure I got this video up by the
end of the month it again here just so
you know the Jen that's in this video
has no idea that it's actually March 1st
so if you don't tell her I won't tell
her and I think we're gonna be able to
just carry on with this video because
the end of the month is coming quick
I've got some really good stuff for you
along with some ruler ruler nerd bad
stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and start
without rambling right now but number 10
the worst product I tried this month is
unfortunately a product that I just got
in PR and not that long ago it's a brand
this is their first time they have sent
me anything this one makes me really sad
because I'm always rooting for brands
especially brands that don't get a lot
of hype on YouTube I want to see brand
succeed but I also have my number one
commitment to you watching this to make
sure that you are buying things that are
worth your money this is something that
I personally don't think is worth the
money this is the Ilia beauty as she was
silk and eyeshadow stick there's a
couple of these that they sent to me
this one I want to show you particularly
because I feel like this one was
particularly disappointing I've tried I
shadow sticks from many different brands
and I've never really found one that I
find does everything for me in that the
pigmentation needs to be there but it
also needs to be able to work well with
other shadows and it needs to not crease
the problem with this one is the
pigmentation is just not there it is a
champagne kind of color but it just it's
a little bit on the whaler side and it
just blends away on to the skin it's so
disappointing with an eyeshadow stick
what I want to be able to do is I want
to be able to run this all over my lid
with me
you one other shadow some eyeliner
mascara and call it a day this just
doesn't have enough pigment in it in
order to lay it down as a single
eyeshadow the only people I feel like
would enjoy this is if you are not an
eyeshadow person and you're just
dabbling in just a little bit of shadow
maybe for a teenager someone that just
wants the slightest slightest hint of
something different on the lid but
honestly I can't recommend this and I'm
really sorry and thank you to el dia for
sending it to me but I'm hoping that you
can improve the formula by by adding a
little bit more pigment to it it just
needs a little more umph
the next product I actually really love
the way it looks on the lips but the
smell is awful I got this in boxycharm
which I also get as PR not sponsored
neither of these none of that stuff is
sponsored this wasn't sponsored I don't
get sponsored boxycharm either but this
is the Grande lips hydrating lip plumper
plumper I love this product but it
smells so stinkin bad I think I
described it in my boxycharm video as it
smells like where my aunt kept the pool
toys it just smells like plastic like
wet plastic it's horrible and it lingers
on the lips for a little while I would
say for like the first 15 minutes before
it goes away
if you have a very sensitive nose like
my father has a very sensitive nose and
he can smell things a mile away you're
not gonna like this so she'll probably
even be able to smell it longer than I
can if they can fix the scent I think
they've got something really really good
here it provides a nice sheer wash of
color that is really really beautiful I
love the texture of it it's not sticky
it's not too oily it's just a really
nice product it's got a little bit of a
plumping feeling but it's not painful
for me if you put it on over top of
another lip product it definitely
lessens the amount of pain you feel from
the plumping if you put it directly onto
your lips it is a bit more intense but
not as intense as like the two-faced lip
injection or the lip eject injection
extreme which is extreme but but yeah I
mean I just think they need to fix the
scent other than that I think it's a
pretty good product next is a very hyped
product especially on Instagram and I
just don't get it and if you get this
product if there's something
you love about this that I'm just not
understanding please leave it in the
comments below because I need to learn
from you because I don't get this this
is the first Sally rose gold elixir it's
very satisfying to see someone dripping
the stuff all over their face on
Instagram I have used this underneath
foundation I have used it mixed in with
foundation and I just don't see a point
in it it adds maybe the very slightest
little bit of luminescence to a
foundation like in that it gives like a
little bit more of a more natural glow
wet rather than something that's very
matte and flat but it's not enough to
justify the price point if this was like
a seven dollar product I would totally
be about it this is the mini size they
do make bigger sizes and this but I
wanted to try it so it just got the mini
but like it's just so incredibly
overpriced for just some oil in a bottle
I just I don't get it I don't get it if
you get it explain it to me please I
need to know
next is the other product from Ilya
Beauty that I've been trying this is the
shade Kokomo in their lip conditioner
this one isn't ineffective but this is
also something that is very low on the
pigmentation it's basically a very
lightly tinted lip balm it reminds me of
the sugar rose lip balms but a little
bit more solid in how it goes on I find
the sugar ones are a little bit too soft
to apply sometimes I press a little too
hard cuz I get a little overzealous and
I men pushing the product all over my
lips and this doesn't do that this is
more it's it's a lot more like a lip
stick to apply but at the same time
you're not gonna get very much pigment
this would be perfect for somebody
that's going to work or school that
doesn't want to have to worry about lip
color through the day fading but wants
to have a little bit of tint because
this fades very very very gracefully the
scent on it it's not very strong there
is a slight almost the nutty scent to it
but it's not offensive in any way it's
quite a nice product I just wish it had
just a little bit more tint to it but I
do think for the right person this is
going to be a perfect product that's why
it's a little bit higher up but for me
personally it's a little lower down and
the other thing is I've got some really
good stuff up the rest of the countdown
so this one had to go in a little bit
lower even though it's really not that
bad it's just and doesn't fit my
personal tastes
completely but I definitely see there's
a huge market for this product this one
makes me sad that is even this lowdown
on the countdown because I am so rooting
for this brand the owner seems amazing
the products are gorgeous the marketing
the website everything is so beautiful
and I'm rooting for this but there's
there's some things in here that I love
and things that I don't love I was
planning on doing a full review of this
but I decided to just throw it into into
this video instead this is the cake face
concealer by Beauty bakery and my big
issue with this is that it dries really
really really fast like really fast and
it makes it very hard to work with so
what I would recommend if you do get
this oh by the way the shade that I got
is called don't give a frappe it's
actually a kind of matches my skin tone
I do wish that I'd gotten the lightest
shade of this but because it does match
my skin tone I was able to use it now
what I would recommend if you are going
to purchase this is as you apply it
apply it on one side put it put it back
in and blend immediately and it gives
the most beautiful beautiful coverage as
far as my dark circles that I do have
under my eyes a slight discoloration
around my face I do find this to be very
effective and a beautiful finish I love
the way it makes my under eyes look I
may actually invest in a lighter shade
of this because I really do like it it's
just that the drying time you just have
to be very very aware and you can't be
doing something else while you're
putting this on I mean really just
boop-boop blend blend blend blend blend
boot boot blend blend blend blend blend
or else it's gonna be really hard to
work with so keep that in mind so not a
bad product but definitely some things I
wish were just slightly different I
recently did a full review of this
product I will link it down below it is
the box of crayons i shadow palette i
almost wish that i have put this down a
little lower but it's like I don't I
don't know how to feel about this at
this point I still haven't heard
anything back from the brand I've been
getting some feedback in the comments
about this palette and different
theories that my subscribers have on
this and some of
them are really resonating with me that
seemed just off for one this is I want
to thank this user I will put their
username right here for her his her I'm
not sure what her what the pronoun is
I'm just gonna say her apologize if the
pronoun is him so one thing that she
mentioned is that this says eyeshadow
palette if you watched my review of this
I did tell you that some of the shades
did stain my eyes now when I looked up
the pigments on this I didn't notice
that any of them weren't eye safe but
they are staining my eyes so they may
not be FDA approved the pigments in here
may not be FDA approved for the eyes
because they called it an eye shadow
with a capital I shadow palette that's a
loophole that they might be able to get
away with it that this may not be I safe
the other thing is the whole PETA thing
the on the back of the box not on the
product there is a PETA Bunny on here
this is PETA certified you have to go
through a lot of measures in order to be
compy to certified I looked on the PETA
website after I film the video did not
see their name the brand name listed on
PETA so I'm thinking they just copied
and pasted the PETA Bunny onto the box
which really disturbs me the other thing
is is it's not labeled for first sale in
that it doesn't have the net weight of
the product it doesn't tell me where
it's manufactured it doesn't tell me
where it's distributed from I mean
that's in every single eyeshadow palette
that exists all the misspellings on the
eyeshadow primer I mean there's an
ingredient that isn't even real in it
from what I can't figure out what the
world it's supposed to be the other ones
are just misspelled I mean it's fine
what was it iron oxide with two x's I
Amy it's just there's so many things on
here that I feel like it's weirding me
out and that they're not responding to
my inquiry on Twitter or through their
contact page it's freaking me out but if
you watch the video I did recommend this
as far as an eyeshadow palette I enjoyed
the way that it worked
I had fun using it as a lasting power
was excellent but there's weird things
about this brand that's freaking me out
man just a little clarification on the
return policy on
this there was someone in the comments
in my video that mentioned that they did
say that the green shadow had come
broken the crayon case told her that she
needed to ship the pallet back and then
they did ship her a new one
so I don't know if that's their policy
or if that's just what they did with
that individual person but I did want to
mention that if it does come broken
there was one person who said that they
did require them to go you know mail it
back this was the same thing that
happened when I had to mail back my
color drained cheers to the beauty
palette they required me to send it back
and they did pay for the shipping for it
and then they sent me a new one so it's
not unusual to want to have the pallet
sent back but at the same time it's kind
of paying the butt for the consumer so I
don't know there's just there's just so
much sketch going on with this and the
brand and the packaging and the
ingredients and freaks me out man even
though I still think the shadows are
great I think the quality is great they
just miss some steps they miss some
things and it's I don't know about this
oh no especially the cruelty free people
I don't know if your cruelty free I'll
know this is the thing I was most
excited about when I got my Beauty lish
lucky bag if you don't know what a
Beauty lish lucky bag is I will link my
video on it down below I was so excited
about this because I had heard so many
wonderful things about it when I did my
video comparing different foil to
eyeshadow formulas I do want to do a
matte version of that at some point but
I've got this huge list of videos that I
want to do before I get to that but it's
on the list of things that I want to do
anyway this is the jouer skinny-dip
ultra foil shimmer shadows this palette
is so much fun it was recently on sale
at the g-way website for 30% off and I
wish I had been able to get this to you
before then so you could have bought it
at 30% off but it may come back at 30%
off so I do want to still let you know
there really aren't that many shadows in
here which is one disappointing thing
there's one shade in here that I don't
particularly enjoy and it's the shade
bikini it's more of a topper than
anything it's just kind of not as good
foil I mean they're just beautiful and
they're so fun to play with I love that
foiled metallic lid it makes me happy in
my heart it brings me joy so
what I pay full price for this no
absolutely not just because there just
aren't enough shades in here if this was
doubled in the number of shadows I would
pay full price for it but because it's
only there's one two three four five
shades in here that I would actually use
I wouldn't I wouldn't pay full price for
this but I am very much loving that and
I'm so happy I got it might be delicious
lucky bag so that I could try it but but
yeah I wouldn't pay full price for it
but it is really good it is good and I
am having fun lasting power is very very
good on it it plays well with other
shadows and I'm loving it a lot number
three this month is a brand that I have
never talked about on this channel and
I've never heard it talked about
anywhere else on YouTube this is a Hong
kong-based brand called pop star
cosmetics and I had never heard of this
brand they sent me a bunch of stuff in
PR but they did not pay I'm not being
paid anything for it the liquid lipstick
shades that they sent I liked but they
were all so bright that they didn't fit
my personal tastes really like their
makeup remover spray that they have
I don't spray things directly on my face
but I sprayed into my hand and I really
like their makeup remover but this was
the stand out for me these are their
mesmerize eyeshadows and they are
incredible they're a wonderful
alternative to the see loved ones but
you I believe you do get more product in
these and also they aren't as glittery
they aren't as chunky so I don't get the
same Fallout or transfer that I do
sometimes with the steelers which are
some of my absolute favorites but these
are just so beautiful on the lid and
it's what i really wanted these Ilias to
be you know to be able to just pop it
all over the lid a little bit of a
transition maybe to go with it a little
bit of island a little bit mascara and
done it is just gorgeous on the lid
especially if you're trying to get out
of the house quickly in the morning you
don't have time to mess with anything
just boop-boop-boop these have not
creased on me at all they set down very
very nicely and they're just very
enjoyable to use I really like them a
lot and again they're a Hong Kong paste
based brand I would love to see more
cosmetics coming out of Hong Kong
I've learned a lot about Hong Kong since
I got this I did some research and Hong
Kong rules and laws are very different
than mainland China so you like this is
cruelty free
I believe that it's also vegan and yeah
very excited to see more from this brand
so thank you to pop star cosmetics for
sending this to me I'm really enjoying
this particular formula number two is
kind of a surprising one to me when I
went to go visit Stephanie Nicole in San
Francisco we went to a little at her
local mall and they gave us a few of the
lip glitters to try out I am wearing
this one on my eyes today this one is in
champagne wishes and this is definitely
my favorite of the shades that I've
tried and it's just absolutely gorgeous
you do need to lay down a glitter glue
lit sells their own glue today I'm
wearing the NYX glitter glue which I
find to be comparable to the Too Faced
one and the lit one I love the next one
I really like the packaging on this as
well it's a screw top lid and then
inside you have a sifter and then the
glitter inside it's got a little bit of
a lip within the sifter so when you open
it up you don't get a bunch of spill
everywhere which I personally very much
appreciate and I'm just I'm just loving
the sparkle lately thanks so much fun
with it so when I have a traditional eye
and I just want to take it up to that
next level for a date night or just for
fun these lik litters have been
wonderful for me so definite recommend
on these if you like that kind of thing
but don't forget your glitter glue and
the last one is you may think this is
lame and if you think it's lame I'm kind
of with you but if whenever there's a
product where I am like okay this
product is totally above and beyond
everything I've ever used in this
category it deserves to be at number one
and I can't I you know even though it's
kind of dumb I still think it deserves
to be at number one this is the East
Salaam without a trace dry shampoo this
is the best dry shampoo I have ever used
in my entire life like it's insane
I've used this on fourth day hair and I
know that that's gross I'm fully aware
that I am gross and I hate washing my
hair I'm with I get it I've tried
batiste I used to love the brunette one
I've tried
Oscar blondie I used to love that one
I've tried the chlorine which was
another one of a whole
Grell one for me the Marc Anthony one I
really loved for a while this one blows
them all out of the water it's on a
whole nother level this is one of the
fabfitfun
extras that I talked about earlier in
the month and it just brought my dry
shampoo game to a whole nother level and
I'm really hoping this is the only
negative thing about this as I'm hoping
that the use of this product won't
encourage me to wait even longer to wash
my hair and I'll be even more gross than
nasty due to this product you know I
don't know maybe it will but for me this
is like and very rarely will I say that
something is a game changer because
everything is pretty much just a
different version of the same thing but
I find this to be exceptional and I am
shocked like I mentioned in that video
it does go on clear like it doesn't have
a white calf like the batiste it'll
either be white or brown or it'll be I
think they have one for blondes a lot of
them do leave a white cast this one is
has no white in it at all and it does
have a very pleasant fruity scent to it
which I personally like I will
definitely be purchasing this when I run
out because it is I don't I don't need
any other dry shampoo for the rest of my
life this is it this is the one this is
the one if I could marry this one I
would because it's the one so that is it
for my monthly favorites and fails for
February of 2018 I hope you enjoyed it
