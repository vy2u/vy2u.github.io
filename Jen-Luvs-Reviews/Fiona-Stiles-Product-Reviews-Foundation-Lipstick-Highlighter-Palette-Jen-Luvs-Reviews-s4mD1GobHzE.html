review of the Fiona Styles makeup line I
am very excited to share this with you
because I know that people the community
are interested and the reason why I know
that is because when Fiona Styles
contacted me when I do two styles or
self but her team contacted me and asked
me if I would like to review some
products because they are launching at
QVC they've actually just launched at
QVC they wanted to know if I wanted to
review some I was like not sure much if
I want to try Fiona style so I ran over
to my facebook group our Facebook group
witches group / what's up in makeup and
I asked them I said hey do you guys want
to hear about Fiona Styles and
overwhelmingly people said yes they're
very interested in learning about Fiona
styles as a brand so Fiona styles was
kind enough or her team was kind enough
to send me some product before review so
let me tell you what we got so the first
thing is the Fiona styles luminous
finish foundation concentrate this is
available in 10 shades and on QVC now
they have it for $34 plus shipping and
handling and it does come with a makeup
brush or you can get an Ulta for $30
with no brush and then we have the color
impact satin lip crayon they set me the
shade Zuma and this is available in six
shades by the way and then finally we
have the light illusion prism palette
and that looks like that so oh and this
is the only shade range available for
this one so I've been trying these for
about a week two weeks I didn't have a
whole lot of time to try them but I've
definitely formed a solid opinion about
how I feel about these products but
before we get into that and all the
geeky stuff that I know you guys know
and love I know and love we're gonna go
ahead and get into a demo of me applying
the product so you'll see me applying
all of these things the rest of my face
you'll see applied in another video
coming up this week so let's go ahead
and jump to the demo so you can see how
these plot products products these
products applied to my face
I
all right so now you've seen the
application of these products let's talk
a little bit about the foundation first
so let's talk about the facts about it
first
it is a water-based foundation but the
second ingredient is dimethicone so that
leads me to believe that any face primer
either water-based or silicone based
will work well for this I did use the
bare minerals primer on purpose because
I feel like it doesn't add any extra
luminosity it doesn't particularly
mattify it just kind of gives a nice
base for foundation so that's why I use
it with this you could see the
luminosity shining through and I do feel
like this is a luminous foundation which
leads me into the next thing I looked up
the ingredients for this and because
dimethicone is the second ingredient in
this it will feel very smooth to go on
to the skin but it also can be not
necessarily a great ingredient for
people with acne prone as skin there's
another ingredient called butylene
glycol that also cannot be good for acne
prone skin it's not everybody with acne
prone skin but some people with acne
prone skin so if you do have acne prone
skin you may want to order this and with
the intention of possibly returning it
if it is not good for you but good news
is if you have dry skin normal skin or
not any other kind of not acne prone
skin this has great great great reviews
and I am personally very much enjoying
it as you could see in the demo it does
start off with a light to medium
coverage and that's with one pump per
side of my face so when I do my entire
face I use two pumps for the demo I used
one pump and then one pump again one
pump and then one pump again over on the
other side so you could see kind of the
the coverage of it and it definitely
builds up on my normal skin it doesn't
have a ton of discoloration doesn't have
acne scarring things like that it
definitely looks like a medium to full
coverage on me as far as covering up my
my freckles a little bit of redness that
I have definitely covers that up and it
leaves a nice luminous finish so you
kind of have to think about what you
like in a foundation to decide whether
that sounds great for you the other
thing I want to talk about is lasting
power
man2 this stuff lasts a really long time
especially when you go that medium to
full coverage route
I feel like that medium to full coverage
route leads you to an entire day of
foundation where at the end of the day
I'm talking 1012 hours after wearing
this I'm down to that light to medium
coverage when I start off with that
medium to full coverage to pump on each
side kind of look if I start off with
that light to medium coverage it's
pretty faded by about that 8-hour mark
so it will get you through a full school
day or a work day and you'll still have
foundation by the end but by the time
you go to bed if you don't wash your
face until you go to bed it'll probably
be pretty much gone by the time you go
to bed if you only do that one pump per
side overall I really like this
foundation for me personally it me it
fits my needs I am starting to really
enjoy that slightly luminous look the
matte and flat look I'm starting to kind
of not really be diggin I like more of
that satin kind of finish and this isn't
so luminous that I'm looking like I'm
shiny or greasy like that's that's not
the way that it looks it just gives a
nice healthy glow to the skin makes it
look more natural so I personally really
like it a lot the only thing is I wish
that I had picked a different shade this
is 0-3 and I feel like I needed just one
shade darker I feel like this was a
little too light for my skin tone but we
made it work
we worked it out by going into the matte
lip crayon this is actually the second
time I've filmed this video I filmed
this video about three hours ago and I
purposely did not touch up my lip
product since then I have eaten a piece
of pizza and I have drank some coffee
and some water and eaten a banana and
this is what my lipstick looks like I'm
gonna go ahead and reapply so you can
see actual reapply on half uno mirror
makeup challenge no mirror makeup
challenge okay so you can see if there's
any difference either gonna mirror let's
see if there's any difference stop being
lazy Jen so there's definitely a
difference in the newly applied versus
the three hours old side once it was
three hours old sorry I had to I just
had to so you can definitely see that
it's faded some but it's faded so evenly
yeah some lipsticks will just fade
around the middle and you'll end up with
this like a ring around the lips
ugliness that did not happen we put on
the russet because I just have to
application is super smooth feels really
good on the lips has a very slight
vanilla set and like I said it is going
to last you a good 3 to 4 hours without
application as long as you're not wiping
your lips getting I did eat a piece of
pizza but I don't think I wiped my lips
at all and the pizza was cold out of the
fridge because I do that sometimes but
yeah so I didn't get a ton of oil on my
lips I did find one I've worn this other
times that after eating I did need to
reapply that there really wasn't any
kind of staining effect part of the
reason why this wore down so evenly
might partly be that it's so close to my
natural skin tone that I can't really
see my lips through it a ton I'd be
curious to see how the darker shades
wear down but so far really really
liking this a lot it's a very nice
product and then finally the light
illusion highlighter palette okay this
is gonna be for very specific people
some people are really going to like
this it is not going to be for other
people this is not for someone that
likes a super glowy Beca highlight like
that that pop in see you from space
highlight that is not this this is a
very subtle highlight palette similar to
the hourglass so if you have very big
pores if you have fine lines and
wrinkles on your face that you don't
want to accentuate yet you want a little
bit of glow this is where you're gonna
go overall I'm really enjoying this you
can definitely see a difference between
the tones I purposely did not put the
same thing on both sides I put this one
on this side and this one on this side
so that you could see the difference in
application I felt like once I put my
blush on I couldn't really see the
difference anymore between the sides
this one I don't feel like I only have
two cheeks I couldn't try all three on
my face today but show you but this one
I even felt like I could work with with
my skin tone it kind of reminds me in
tone similar to like a Becca's opal
something like that as far as the
deepness of it so if you have Becca opal
and you you are okay with that tone
you'll probably really like this but
because these are so subtle of shades I
feel like people of any skin tone can
wear them because they're not ones that
like really stand out as being highly
pigmented they just give you a nice soft
glow and I really
my biggest critique of this is the
lasting power is not fantastic let me
check my three hour wear see three hour
wear I'm seeing like there's still a lot
of highlight left after three hours but
after six hours it's pretty much gone at
that point so if you want your highlight
to be on all day long like from from the
time you get to work or school to when
you leave you may want to bring this
with you to reapply thankfully it's got
a very strong magnetic closure and it's
very very hard packaging so this is
something you could throw in your purse
and reapply if you wanted to but that's
really the only possibly negative ish
thing that I can see about this is it
doesn't last all day it'll last you
through most of the day all in all I
mean pretty positive for Fiona Stiles
I'm feeling pretty good about it I would
love to try more from the line at some
point I don't know if I will right now

things I want a review but it's not what
