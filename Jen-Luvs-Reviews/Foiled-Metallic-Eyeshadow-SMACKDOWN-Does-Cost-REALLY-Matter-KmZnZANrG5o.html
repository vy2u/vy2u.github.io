lover has their favorite brands and
favorite formulas I know that I do but I
had a question in my head and I was
wondering if price really truly mattered
in the formula the lasting power all of
that of these foil shadows what really
is the difference between a $125 palette
and a $6 eyeshadow single what it really
really and truly is it the way that it
looks is the texture is the lasting
power what is it so I have a ton of
foiled and metallic eyeshadows to share
with you we're gonna do ice watches and
I'm gonna show you how they all work and
it's gonna be in a really fun format so
hang tight and we're gonna get into that
right now alright so the way this is
gonna work I'm really excited about this
it's gonna be like a dame down in the
description down below I'm gonna list in
a mixed-up order all of the different
brands that I'm gonna be showing you
today and then we're going to do eye
swatches not arms swatches we're gonna
do AI swatches I'm gonna tap the shadow
the foiled or metallic shadow onto my
lid on this side on this side I'm gonna
be using my mac 242 brush 242 through 40
- where's your number what are you - 42
on this side it's just a flat shader
brush and you're going to think in your
head hmm I think that it's this brand
after I've showed you the swatches on my
eyes the application of the swatches
then I'm going to reveal the brand to
you I'm also going to give you a number
of hours of where that this typically
lasts on me now this is with an eye
primer most of the time I use my Urban
Decay primer potion or my Ulta eye
primer at these are my holy grail i
shadow primers the formula is very very
similar so that's using these primers
because these are the ones that use that
work the best for me the point of this
is to kind of show the texture the
finish of these different formulas
everybody's got their own comfort when
it comes to shiny eyeshadows some people
don't like them at all some people love
them if you don't like shiny eyeshadows
at all not sure how much you're gonna
get out of this video unless you're
thinking about dab
this is all about shiny eyeshadows
because those are my personal favorites
what this is not going to show you is
how these shadows work with other
shadows it's not gonna give you a full
comprehensive range of what the entire
brand has to offer because this is just
an example of one shadow from their line
they may have various formulas that may
be more shiny or less shiny it's just I
can't I can only do so much if you want
a video I just wanted to give you kind
of an overview of a lot of the things
that I personally own of course there
are so many more awesome foiled and
metallic eyeshadows out there available
at all different price points I would
love to know your favorites in the
comments down below also after you're
done watching this video were you
surprised by some of the shadows and how
they apply did you think that they were
more expensive than they were or were
some of the really expensive ones
disappointing to you thinking wow that's
it that's all that shadow has to offer
at that price point so I cannot wait to
hear what you guys think of these I'm
not gonna ramble on anymore just know
that this is as comprehensive as I could
personally make it in this kind of
format if you have suggestions for
future videos like this I am always open
to hearing your ideas because why
shouldn't I be
you know if I'm trying I'm trying to do
something like this I want it to be
valuable to you so you have a way that
it could be more valuable let me know in
