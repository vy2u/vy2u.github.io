unique Birchbox video this is not a
Birchbox subscription opening this is a
video highlighting the birch box shop
Birchbox actually emailed us and told us
that we did a good job on our birch bark
Smackdown video high fives whoa so
really excited about that I was like Gus
well he asked me to pick for things and
I decided to share two of those things
with John since he is part of the smack
down which we just posted the Smackdown
video for August slow low light so if
you missed that I'll put the link to
that down below it will also be at the
end of the video those of you that are
members of Birchbox know how awesome the
Birchbox point system is it blows fc's
point system out of those stinking water
when you review products you earn points
which can get you items from the
Birchbox shop so these are things that
are currently available on the barge box
shop so if you're saving up your points
these are some things that you get or
you know you can just go on the bursh
box shop and shop there are things that
you like so with your real money with
your real money so let me go ahead and
just go ahead and start let me show you
first this jus air long-wear cream
mousse our shadow this is a really
strange product when I pulled it out I
was like what is up with this it comes
in a little pot like this and then you
open it up and it looks like this but
it's like squishy like it's like a give
to it almost like the arm the Armani
eyes to kill its got like a little bit
of a softness to it which is very
strange it is um if you're looking for
that field effect that's becoming really
really popular this will definitely give
that to you so right now I'm going to
cut into my eye look for today so you
can see how this product applies
alright so as you can see it applies
very very evenly across the lid i did
Pat it on with my fingers I've tried it
with a brush I like it better with my
fingers and the lasting power one is
great the only thing is is it will have
fallout through the day so I ended up at
the end of the day with just very fine
glitter underneath my eyes so if you're
using this for an evening out it'll be
fine if you're using it for just a few
hours during the day it'll be fine but
any more than three or four hours you're
going to start to have some solid
glitter happen and down here so bring a
little makeup remover white bring your
concealer and touch it up through the
day if you don't want to have that
glitter under your eyes so that's kind
of my final verdict on this product
overall really like it but definitely
watch out for that fallout me yes it's
your turn alright so my product is the
full size Sookie exfoliating foaming
cleanser and strong safe solutions for
your skin problems now this product
right here the sucky difference our
round edge sugar crystals slough dead
skin without tearing smooth and even
facial skin and melt into pure aaha for
healthy cell renewal results seen
immediately and can I tell you a secret
babe what I'm gonna confess that I I
convinced you to get that because I
wanted to use it I did I wanted I wanted
it forever because I got in a birchbox
like a really really long time ago and I
think that the video was something about
my favorite products like I did like
their products and why I want to eat my
cleanser like that was the cleanser that
I want to eat it tastes like straight
lemonade like you don't really eat it
and drink it but will give accidentally
gets like on the corners your mouth it's
like tastes like lemonade and you can
see how much product has been destroyed
I have been using it as well so and I'm
okay with the fact that we got a full
size of it because I went through the
sample that I got in my last birchbox
not too quickly but quickly enough that
it was like yeah I could keep using that
I have some different exfoliators that I
use this is a little bit more on the
gentle side and I definitely I can see
the the difference between this and some
of the other ones that I
out there a little bit more like a salty
kind of crystal that is tend to be a
little rougher and so this art is
something that you could certainly use a
little bit more frequently than
something like that without damaging
your face kind of like an everyday
everyday cleanser would you agree
definitely my favorite cleanser of all
time my next product that I chose to get
which I was really excited they let me
get is the lack of and company little
lip kit now let me show you I got this
little this laughing company lip lube in
a previous Birchbox and I absolutely
loved it it was very moisturizing the
pigmentation was not too insane but I
really really I mean for like the
Pantone color of the year like I feel
like I can actually wear this one
because it's not totally painted on so
it was really excited about this and was
very happy that they let me get this
little collection now they did have a
collection of the lip boobs on there but
they were very bright summery colors and
I felt like this little lip kit had some
ones that I could probably wear into the
fall and winter so that's why I got it
so it comes like this and you get your
little lippies in here and they are the
crayon that Kip crayons that roll up and
down and I'm going to go ahead and show
you the lip swatches for those right now
okay so overall I'm really happy with
these my definite favorite one here is
the Faerie blood one that's the one I'm
wearing today it's my absolute favorite
it's got a little bit of a shimmer to it
absolutely love that also really
enjoying the Wolfman one but I do feel
like it's a little more of a nude color
so I have to make sure like what what
man is new I guess he is I never knew
that Wolfman was nude but he is uh so I
mean I feel like I've if I have a more
bold I look this one's really nice on
the lips because it's not so new that
it's got like that dead lip look but
it's a nice nude the other three were a
little too bold for me but I can I know
a lot of y'all I probably would have
your eye on these because of the bold
color they're a little crazy for me
they're gonna be for date night they're
gonna be for holidays things like that
but overall they're very moisturizing
you could see in the video they were
staining my lips it was really hard to
get it off for the next watch I do feel
like though that you did get a true
representation of the color even though
they were kind of over a stain of the
previous color I really feel like you
could see it the true color on there but
they do have a staining effect and the
wear off of them is very very even
you're not going to get that patchy like
nastiness here or you know wearing in
different places more than others if
they wear very evenly so overall really
really happy with these now okay so I
was doing my research for the lip lubes
and I went to the lack of company
website and I was like wow this really
cool nail polishes so being the nail
polish junkie that I am I emailed them
and said hey I'm going to be reviewing
your little lip kit and would you like
me to review some of your nail polish as
well and they were like yeah sure like
totally will send you some so the one
that I asked them to send me because
they asked me to pick one was this one
here and this one is the tuxedo manicure
and those of y'all dinner nail polish
junkies you might want to look into this
look at this but bam bam you get both
colors in one little stick the site is
matte black and this side is glossy
black and the glossy is glossy and the
matt is Matt like no joke Matt the brush
is pretty typical let me show you kind
of the brush it's like just the typical
nail polish brush nothing crazy and it
goes on very very smooth
like the matte black definitely went on
a little bit streak here but it's a
matte color I expected that it starts
glossy dries to a mat and it takes a
good two solid two coats three if you
really want to be good with it black the
black gloss takes about two coats for it
to be opaque and really really enjoy
this lasting power on all of the
polishes i'm going to show you where it
was about two days without a chip but
that's typical for me and my nails no
matter what topcoat i use my nail polish
always lasts me about about two days
before it shipped so these were pretty
typical they are nothing fantastic for
where time but nothing out of the
ordinary for you know not good quality
the next one they sent me is the one I'm
wearing today and this one is in cagney
and I know you're just sitting there and
I apologize that you're just sitting
there doing nothing but this one is
really cool and this is the gold Fleck
manicure and I'm going to kind of zoom
in so you can see what this looks like
okay so this is kind of how this came
out you put the pink base down then you
add the gold flecks right there and this
one is a really fun manicure I will say
that this takes a solid four coats for
opacity for the pig that's why I'm kind
of like it's already down here I've used
it three times and it's down here
because it does take a lot to build this
one up the gold flecks are really fun to
play with what I recommend if you do get
this is that you take the brush and you
let it drip like you kind of get a lot
of the product off before you paint it
so that it's does you don't have a lot
of the clear so that when you do paint
it on you get mostly the gold flecks
also have a pair of tweezers handy in
case you don't like the placement you
can kind of move them around to get the
gold flecks exactly where you want them
but the final look of this once you you
know do the four coats once you get the
gold flecks where you want them is
absolutely beautiful I love the way that
it came out it just takes a little bit
love to get it there if you know what I
am the last nail polish they sent me was
this one here in gremlin and this is
just one of their single polishes don't
feed it after midnight I don't write any
well that's that grandma's that is
gremlins don't even
midnight too funny and this is what
their regular polish was look like same
exact brush just you know typical nail
polish brush this one was two coats to
opacity not streaky really nice polish
and I love this color this color super
pretty so very happy with this I really
like this one paired with a white polish
I did something with white stripes on it
with my white striper and love the way
that looked it would also look really
nice with some white polka dots things
like that just some simple easy you know
nail art kind of stuff looks really
pretty with this the final thing that
they set me was the nail polish remover
pads that they have I did use one of
these pads to do all ten nails but it
did get quite goopy by the last couple
of nails by lit nail eight nine ten the
nail pad was really feeling it but you
can stretch it to get all ten nails with
one pad I felt like it moisturized my
nails as I took off my polish and I
really really like this a lot really
nice product especially on the go for
travel I throw this in your purse and
your nails looking like doodoo you can
just take it off on the go so those are
the things that i got from Lakha and
company along with the things that
Birchbox said and now I'm finally gonna
let John talk John's got one more
product to show you I know did you even
remember how to talk cuz I've been
talking for so long yes hmm and my
second product that I got is from ursa
major it's a foreign one essential face
tonic and I decided to pick this product
because I've never used a facial tonic
before and I was like ooh that sounds
real fancy my face wants tonic and also
I used another product from ursa major
fantastic facial cleanser that I did get
a sample of in one of my other birch
boxes and I enjoyed and so I figured hey
I'll try another one of their products
I'll read to you from the back here this
potent liquid cure-all it's a cleanser
exfoliator post-shave healer and toner
in one removes oil and grime dissolves
dead skin and clears blocked pores while
combating blemishes razor bumps and
ingrown hairs Sue's and hydrates to boot
use daily it'll deliver clearer brighter
calmer skin what's not to like so
basically you don't need anything else
in your life but that
I don't care what they're saying that's
what they're saying the way that I use
this is I do my facial cleansing and
then I go ahead and shave and i'll use
this post shave this is very instead of
using some of the other aftershaves that
i use which can sting a little bit this
is a nice soothing calming refreshing
splash on my face after i after i shave
and so i really like this as an
aftershave and then also kind of as a
step before I put my moisturizer on my
face so this is a big win for me the
scent says that it's a low bamboo and
lemon has a little bit of a citrusy a
little bit of like a calming kind of
just smell to it I have used this every
day and I still have a ton of this left
in here so this gonna take me forever to
go through oh my goodness it's like full
it's like to hear it's gonna take me a
long time to get through it but at this
point if I had to speculate I would
probably repurchase this item without a
second thought i'm sure that i'll try
some other stuff between now and then so
we'll keep you in loop but this is a
daily thing for me i like it and it's
got a nice fresh manly smell like i can
tell like why he likes it it's
definitely like a masculine clean smell
so cool yeah so those are the items that
we got from the Birchbox shop overall
very happy with everything we have
gotten a couple of things from their
shop before with my points and you know
yeah i mean when when you you earn
points from doing the reviews on there
so anybody can get this stuff I believe
that subscribe to birchbox also I think
anybody can go on that's not subscribed
to birchbox and just shop on the shop so
even if you don't have a virtualbox
subscription you can still go on there
and shop things and sometimes they'll
have items that you could get it like
Sephora or alter or whatever but then
they'll add in like an extra so like for
example they had the revealed 2 palette
from Coastal Scents but then they also
added in a brush with it so that kind of
gave it a little bit of a bonus and that
combo was exclusive to the birchbark
shop so check it out if you're you know
in the market for some new makeup I
definitely recommend checking out the
shop you know I mean just it's
just a little bit different shopping on
there than shopping other places so you
never know what you're going to find
never know what you're going to see and
also there is a ridiculous amount of
reviews I know a lot of you use makeup
Ali for your makeup reviews but the
reviews on Birchbox there's tons of them
so you'll be able to see whether people
are enjoying the product before you buy
it and that's always really nice as well
so definitely highly recommend the
birchbox shop and you check it out so

appreciate it and thank you so much for
