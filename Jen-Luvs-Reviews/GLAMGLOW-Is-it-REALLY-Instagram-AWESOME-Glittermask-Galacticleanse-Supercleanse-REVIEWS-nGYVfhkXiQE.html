brands that you see on Instagram a lot
and I've always been curious about it
and whether it really is as good as
everybody says or if it's just gimmicky
and marketing and paid advertising so
when glam glow decided to send these to
me I was kind of like hmm and see
whether this stuff is legit so if that
sounds good hang tight we're getting
into it right now like I mentioned in
the intro these two products were sent
to me by glam glow I've been trying
these for about three weeks now
something like that and then at the
Sephora vib a Rouge sale I decided I was
going to get the glitter mask
I haven't actually opened this and tried
the so we're gonna do a first
impression on this but I'm gonna give
you full tested reviews on these two
cleansers we're gonna go ahead and go
into what these products claim to do so
you can decide whether these things are
good for you or not so first thing you
need to know is that they are available
at Sephora and Nordstrom and then glam
glow calm their website they are not
cruelty free this is their statement we
do not test our products on animals nor
do we ask others to conduct conduct
animal testing on our behalf except
we're required by law that's the same
statement by L'Oreal and many other
brands when they are not cruelty free
basically they're not going to test on
animals unless they're required to but
in order to sell in China they are
required to test on animals so they are
not cruelty free these products however
are made in the United States they do
not contain parabens but all of them do
contain artificial fragrance as most
skin care products these days seem to as
far as prices go we've got here these
super cleanse this is $32 you get five
ounces of product this is specifically
for normal oily and combination skin and
then we have the Galactic cleanse this
one is also $32 for five ounces it's for
normal combo and
my skin and then the hashtag glitter
mask gravity mud firming treatment this
is $69 $69 okay it's 1.7 ounces it is
the same product as their gravity mud
it's just glittery so I've never tried
the gravity mud it's the exact same
thing it is for normal Whaley combo or
dry skin so I just so you know my skin
type I do have normal skin I don't have
particularly large pores I have a little
bit of redness but nothing that really
you know can't be easily covered with a
lighter BB cream this is freshly
cleansed face with no anything else on
it so this is you're seeing what my skin
is I don't have problems with blemishes
everyone small get some dry patches I
would say if I had to lean one way
either oily or dry I would say I lean a
little bit dry but not really to the
point where it's any kind of problem
where I have significant dry patches or
anything so as a skincare and makeup
reviewer it's kind of a blessing and a
curse
in that I can only review things from my
normal skin perspective except for when
it comes to ingredients so we're gonna
talk about the ingredients that are in
these products so we can see kind of how
they back up these claims with actual
ingredients if you're not interested in
the ingredients you just want to go to
my review I will put skip ahead buttons
down in the description below so let's
go ahead and start with the galactic
cleanse and this is made specifically
for normal combo or dry skin the number
one ingredient in this is capric and
caplet triglyceride and that's derived
from coconut oil it is a skin
replenishing ingredient it's something
that I really like to see in skincare
the second ingredient is actually
sunflower oil which is another hydrating
ingredient next we have the cleanser
which is something called ISO hexa
decane I believe and then the a
moisturizer and anti-aging ingredient
called hydrogenated poly death scene
some other notable ingredients in here
beyond the top-4 we have glycerin which
is a humectant we also have meteorite
powder I actually have a very funny /
serious funding article on meteorite
powder down in the description
like is it really from meteorites and
the answer is supposedly yes it is from
meteorites and it is really in here very
very expensive ingredient according to
that article it doesn't seem to have any
proven skin benefits though just so you
know but it is kind of a fun thing that
it's actually in here there's evening
primrose oil not a lot of research
behind that one but one that there is a
lot of research behind is the white tea
leaf extract for anti-aging antioxidant
properties love to see me some white tea
green tea and my skincare makes me super
super happy
keeping in mind though that a cleanser
is only gonna be on your face for so
long before you wash it off so I really
like to see those those are even better
for me and like a moisturizer and things
like that rather than a cleanser but I'm
still I'm not hating on it that it's in
here that makes me super happy moving on
to the super cleanse number one
ingredient is water and then a
relatively harsh cleanser according to
the research that I've done he's not
harsh cleanser but it's a pretty intense
cleanser it's called sodium sea 14-16
olefin sulfonate then there's a texture
ingredient the foaming ingredient and
Sottero I'll collect ingredient is
something called glyceryl stearate it
slows the loss of water from the skin by
forming a barrier on the skin's surface
it's been shown to protect the skin from
free radical damage as well I will put
the reference for that quote down below
glycerin and then charcoal powder which
is supposed to draw bacteria out of the
skin and impurities and things like that
not really any other good ingredients in
here that stand out there is eucalyptus
leaf in here which they promote glam
glow promotes as being really really
good the only research that I could find
it was from a really good source on that
said that it can be a skin sensitizer so
if you have sensitive skin you may want
to stay away from this one this one
seems like one that maybe a little bit
too harsh for someone with sensitive
skin based on the ingredients there's
peppermint oil in here and that's
another one that can kind of be a little
harsh for some people it is an
antibacterial ingredient
there's licorice fruit extract some
other extracts things like that but this
one is definitely a little more harsh
where this one is a little more hydro
and this one specifically is made for
more oily skin so it makes sense that it
would be more harsh hello it's editing
Jen here I was watching this back as I
was editing and I did want to mention
one more thing about oily skin and harsh
cleansers you really need to be careful
because you don't want to strip the skin
of oils because it can actually increase
your oil production so honestly at this
point I don't even know if I would
recommend this for oily skin based on
the ingredients I would love to know in
the comments below if you do have oily
skin if this has been an effective
cleanser for you but at this point I
can't recommend this cleanser even for a
wiggly skin because I would hate for it
to throw your pH out of balance because
it's just too stripping and too harsh
based on the fragrances that are used
the extracts and the cleansers used all
right back to the video but just kind of
keep that in mind when you're trying to
pick out which one you might want to try
now with the Glitter mask this is mostly
water and then the polyvinyl alcohol
which is the peel-off part of this then
third ingredient is denatured alcohol
which is a skin drying ingredient so if
you have trickily dry skin I would not
recommend purchasing this product I
would be afraid that it would dry your
face out even more the next ingredient
is texture and then a humectant and a
solvent and then the next ingredient is
witch hazel and witch hazel I've heard
is either wonderful for people or
terrible for people so it's supposed to
be an anti-inflammatory and a skin
conditioner antimicrobial and they say
it can treat Sun damaged so that's a
good ingredient here probably for most
people and then the next is an oil
absorbing clay I'll have the name and
there I'm on Mourinho Knight I don't
know
mozzarella Knight penciling glycol which
is skin conditioning and for texture and
then there's more clays and things like
that so this is gonna be drawing out
impurities kind of thing I don't really
see the firming ingredients in here that
was one that I felt like it's supposed
to be a firming mask but I didn't see a
lot of firming stuff in here a lot of
anti-aging it was mostly like clays to
draw out impurities and stuff you know
there's marshmallow leaf extract which
helps inflammation but where's my
firming stuff that's what I'm wondering
with this I was
disappointed that it didn't have more
firming type ingredients in it so I
don't know so from the ingredients this
looks like it would be best for people
that want to just pull out the
impurities out of their skin rather than
using it as an anti-aging product oh my
gosh it's so tiny it's so tiny this is
$69 it's so small oh my gosh well that's
really small it's hard to place what it
smells like if you've tried this make
sure you tell me what you think it
smells like it smells like some kind of
candy to me like a lollipop like a
citrus kind of lollipop so we're gonna
go ahead and put on the hashtag glitter
mask and while that is setting on my
face I'll tell you what I think of the
cleansing products and then after this
is completely done being on my face I'll
give you my first impression review of
this it says stir before use if required
this doesn't look like it needs to be
stirred it looks fine apply generous
even layer to clean skin with a brush
avoiding eyebrows and hairline and leave
on for 20 to 30 minutes let me go ahead
and get my head wrapping thing I'm just
gonna go ahead I can't find my bear ears
I don't know what I did with them so I'm
just gonna go ahead and put this regular
headband on just to make sure my hair is
out of the way as much as possible and
this is so fun it's definitely very cute
oh it's dripping it's dripping its smell
I can smell it really strong it smells
really good
definitely very candy like and it really
is cute I can see a teenager really
loving and playing with this
it feels very smooth and very cold oh no
no no a little bit in my hairline groups
so the mast is on oh my gosh it looks
crazy
down here after one use but I don't
think it was completely full but I would
imagine you wouldn't get a ton of uses
out of this little jar it's it's
disappointing the size especially
considering the price I feel like we
should have gotten twice as much for the
$69 price you know with the ingredients
and everything I just feel like you know
they should have given more that's just
my opinion we're gonna set the timer
we're gonna do it says it says 20 to 30
minutes let's look at 20 minutes and see
how we're doing it 20 minutes as this is
drying it does feel a little bit cling
on the skin it's not uncomfortable per
se but it's significant cold feeling on
my face just as an update on that okay
so now let's go ahead and go into the
full review of the two different
cleansers that were sent to me by glam
glow so this is the super cleanse
clearing cream to foam cleanser and I
feel like I have to tell you this was
not meant for my skin type I don't feel
like this was meant for normal skin
unless you're normal - Whaley the
ingredients in here are a little bit
harsh so I felt like my skin was
stripped after using this my skin felt
dry it didn't feel right you know I was
like oh I don't really like this it
smells like black licorice it smells
really good if you like black licorice I
don't like to eat black licorice but I
do like the scent of it and it smells
very good as if an effectiveness of a
cleanser it did remove my makeup it did
seem like it made my skin clean but I
feel like it was a little bit too much
for me so this one is gonna be a no for
me personally based on the ingredients I
would definitely do a patch test if you
have sensitive skin before you put this
all over your face because the cleanser
may be a little bit harsh for you now
moving on to the Galactic cleanse I
really really like the glasses a lot
this one smells I'm not even joking you
exactly like strawberry starbursts like
that amazing strawberry starbursts no it
smells so good it
out let me well this one this one cut is
like a gray color
I could see rainbows when I look down
I'll just kind of show you so this one's
like a muddy gray look where this one
the Galactic one is this sparkly black
and it is jelly it's a jelly cleanser so
when you put it all over it does smooth
out let me put it let's do this let's
put a little bit on this side and then
we'll take this one and put it on this
side so you can see what these look like
as they're on your face so this is the
mud one and then this one is the jelly
cleanser they're very very different
this one I really liked I've had it
there isn't any right wipe this off hold
on the jelly cleanser I felt like was
just as effective as far as cleansing my
skin but it didn't make my skin feel dry
is it out of this world something that
you have to have that it's gonna change
your life
no but is it a good functional product
for me absolutely works really really
well this is something that I would
purchase if this was not sent to me I
would purchase this again absolutely
where this one I'm going to pass this
one on because I don't think that it's
right for me we're about seven minutes
in on the glitter mask right now it
still feels a little cool in certain
parts I did really put quite a bit of
the mask on I wanted to make sure I
could peel it off and everything will
kind of evaluate later whether I did do
the right amount I think I did the right
amount based on the way that it was
applying I did feel I do feel as its
drying just a slight little bit of like
tingly and not in a good way on my
forehead on my nose as it was drying it
was just like the slightest bit of
uncomfortable tingling like not tingle I
don't know it's not like it's on the
edge of pain you know where it's just
not it doesn't feel good to me and it's
only like when it goes from that cold
feeling to the dry feeling like my nose
doesn't feel it anymore but now I feel
it on my forehead and it just doesn't
feel comfortable I think if you don't
have particularly sensitive skin if
you're not really paying attention you
may not even notice but for me because
I'm trying to review it I'm trying to be
really sensitive to how my face feels
like really think about it and I feel
like a little bit of weirdness on my
forehead
right now so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna let this dry completely and then
we're gonna peel it off together in
about 12 minutes so I will see you then
it's gonna be two seconds for you it's
gonna be 12 minutes for me all right now
it has been 20 minutes since this has
been on my face my face does feel tight
because it has the mask on it it feels
very firmed but that's because my face
is covered in polyvinyl alcohol so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead
and peel this off but one thing I want
to show you before I peel it off is that
if you notice when I go like this I
don't get glitter on my hands which I
seriously appreciate because glitter
spreads especially if you have children
you know this glitter spreads like
nothing else ever move you have glitter
eyeshadow you probably know this too
it's just it's so hard to get glitter to
stop spreading once you've gotten it
somewhere so I appreciate that all the
glitter is staying in the mask and it's
not all over my fingers I think that's
awesome
all right we're interrupting this review
for just a minute it is now evening time
just put my kids to bed Sun is down so
the Lighting's gonna be a little bit
different so I could have a picture of
me wearing my glam glow glitter mask up
on Instagram and I didn't realize that
there was going to be such a big
response to me posting this picture I
put up the picture and I went about the
rest of my day I you know finished the
video up I picked up my kids I fed him
dinner all that stuff my husband got
home from work a couple hours later and
he was like man you really triggered
some people with the Glanville picture I
was like what and he's like you didn't
check the comments like no I've been
busy I didn't check the comments well it
turns out there is a lot of
misconception about this glitter mask
and I wanted to clear a couple of those
things up that I didn't realize when I
originally filmed the video so the first
thing that I want to clear up is that a
lot of people are worried that the
glitter in here would be scratchy and I
can tell you it is absolutely not
scratchy at all I did not feel a single
scratch from any of these little stars
when I was rubbing it on my face I
didn't feel any kind of scratches not
even the tiniest little bit the other
thing was is that I was trying to pull a
little star out the other thing was as
people were concerned that there was
metal being placed on my face I don't
know if you've ever felt craft glitter
stars before but they're not metal per
se they're like I mean I guess they they
might be considered metal but they're
more like a plastic than anything I
don't know I mean they're typical little
glitters it's not like a rough scratchy
like a piece of metal you know what I
mean they're very thin and it's like
traditional little glitter stars I mean
there's there's really nothing
spectacular about them but they're
definitely not scratchy in any way at
all
the other big huge concern that I got
both on my facebook because my Instagram
posts directly to my face book was about
washing the glitter down the sink and I
think at this point in the video you
probably know that this mask is not a
wash off mask this is a mask that you
peel off now a lot of the concern
environmentally with glitter has to do
with the the accumulation of glitter in
the water and because this is a peel-off
mask there really isn't much to wash off
you're gonna see in a minute that I did
have to wash off little specks of the
mask that were kind of left as residue
but I think that was partially my fault
because they didn't let the mask dry
completely I thought I did but then when
I went to peel it off I realized that
there were a couple of little spots that
didn't dry completely and I did wash
those off but the big chunks of glitter
all can't come off with masks and you're
gonna see that in just a minute so there
really isn't a big concern with glitter
going down the sink I would be much more
concerned with elementary schools that
do glitter projects and washing off the
paint brushes I would be much more
concerned about that than I would be
about anyone using this masters I mean
is it perfect no could it couldn't it's
some of the tiny bits of glitter get
into the sink absolutely but I really
feel like it would just be the smallest
tiniest amount of course that can't
accumulate over time but is it
biggest offender that we need to worry
about as far as glitter going down the
sink I personally don't think so if you
don't agree with this mask as far as the
glitter in it then you totally should
not buy it it's very clear that there's
glitter in it if you don't like that
then you know that's definitely not
something you should invest in and it is
big investment we're gonna get more into
that when we get to the full review so I
don't want to spend too much extra time
on this because there is more of my
actual video to come but I did want to
address the Instagram comment so let me
just make sure I didn't miss anything
okay there's a comment that says glitter
is not skincare but the skillet just
want to make sure this is clear the
glitter in here is not meant to be
skincare it's just an added fun thing
that they've put in to try to be I'm
assuming unique and fun it's not meant
to be skincare and I didn't think that
needed to be said but I just want to
make sure I put it in there just in case
because I know if people are concerned
on Instagram there's gonna be concerns
on YouTube as well and I want to address
them because if I know that there's
gonna be concerns someone had mentioned
to be careful putting it around your
eyes it should not get anywhere near
your eyes at one point when I was
putting it on you may have seen a little
drip kind of drip down into my eyelashes
when I was putting it on my face that
was my fault
I just be really careful when you're
putting it on your forehead not to let
it drip into your eyes but I feel like
if you're you know paying attention more
than I was paying attention then you
shouldn't be getting it in your eyes
it's not even supposed to get on your
eyebrows and I was not I don't recommend
putting it underneath your eyes I feel
like this area is very very sensitive
and you don't really want to put in my
opinion up heal off mask in the hollow
of your eye I feel like it should kind
of stop at your cheekbone where your
skin isn't quite as delicate so that was
it for the Instagram concerns if you
have any additional questions about this
mask after the video is over feel free
to leave those in the comments down
below and I'll answer them as best as I
can
this video is for information purposes
only I don't have an agenda here okay I
am NOT you know going for the brand I am
NOT you know trying to say that it's bad
for no reason I'm just trying to tell
you the truth of what the ingredients
are and what my personal experience is
but the
products so just know that that that
that you know this is just me trying to
provide information for you and you at
this point is your job is to decide
whether this product is right for you or
not all right I'm done with the
disclaimers let's get back to the
regular video with much better lighting
so let's go ahead and peel this off and
I'll tell you kind of how my face feels
as a first impression I'm trying to get
a good spot to peel it over here on the
side a little bit painful because I've
got some baby hairs over here I noticed
as I was snapchatting this look I'm Jen
loves reviews on snapchat by the way as
I was snapchatting this look like it's a
look I noticed that I didn't do my upper
lip it is what it is I don't usually put
face masks on my upper lip
especially the peel-off kind because
I've got baby hairs there and it kind of
hurts so it's a little bit uncomfortable
but oddly satisfying peeling my face all
right here comes them they're like I'm
ready to go to one of those costume
parties now like I have one of those
cool glitter eye masks on okay my face
is coming off well it broke I trying to
take it off in one piece but I missed I
feel like that my forehead now that I'm
peeling this off wasn't 100% dry and it
might have been because I put it on too
thick and it does recommend you can do
twenty to thirty minutes so that's
probably my fault I wouldn't blame the
mask for that okay let me see how my
face looks it just came off like that
and I'm gonna throw this in the trash
this should not go down the sink do I
still have some mask on my face I think
that's due to two reasons number one I
put it on quite thick and number two I
left it on for the minimum amount of
time which was twenty minutes so if I
had left it on for the full 30 minutes
then it probably wouldn't have all of
this because the rest of it did come off
very easily
before I splash my face with some water
I just want to kind of talk about how my
face feels it feels normal like my face
feels like it has
it doesn't feel like it's been cleansed
it doesn't feel tight or dry or
materially oily or hydrated in any way
it just kind of feels normal
I'm gonna go ahead and wash off what I
have left on my face at this point and
then I'll kind of tell you how my skin
feels just from touching it but for
right now my skin feels good it feels
nice the rest of the mask is now off it
was very easy to come off with just a
little bit of warm water very easy to
come off again I think that was my fault
I wouldn't blame the mask for that but
my face to the touch feels normal
I don't feel like it really did anything
mediate and magical but as you know
skincare takes a very long time for it
to show any results but based on the
ingredients I don't think that this is
worth the $69 except for the fun factor
for the fact that you have these really
fun holographic glitters all over your
face your peeling off the mask so it's
got that you know tactile you know oddly
satisfying feeling pulling it off it
wasn't incredibly painful just around
wherever I had any baby hairs it was a
little bit painful but it wasn't bad at
all at all I really think that what
you're paying for here is the experience
not the actual skin care if you have
tried the gravity mud which is the exact
same formula as this or this for a
longer period of time than a first
impression I would love to know your
thoughts on it in the comments below or
if you have experience with either of
the cleansers please let me know in the
comments below we are the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness this review
isn't just about me in my opinions you
are the other part of this and reading
down below other people's experiences is
part of the whole thing of my channel
that it's it's about all of us together
working hard to make sure we're spending
money on the things that are worth it
and saving our money on things that are
crap so if you want more information on
these I would definitely recommend
reading the comments below and also
please sharing your experiences so
people can learn from you but for me at
this point the only thing that I
personally would recommend from
something that I like is the Galactic
Cleanse which I absolutely loved this
one maybe
you have oily skin that's not sensitive
and this one if you want something
really fun without a ton of skin benefit
so I want to thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
it I hope you found it helpful thank you
so much to glam glow for sending me the
cleansers I really appreciated being
able to try your products and mad love
