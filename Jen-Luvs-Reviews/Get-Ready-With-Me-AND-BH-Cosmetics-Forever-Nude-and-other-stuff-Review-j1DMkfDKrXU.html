angle I've been getting a lot of
requests lately for a tutorial and I I'm
terrified of doing a tutorial because I
don't know I just don't feel like I'm
like the authority on makeup application
I'm more like a person that likes to
like share my opinions rather than like
teach you how to do something because I
feel like I don't know like you guys
already know how to do what I do but I
get beginning request so I figured I
would do it any noise in the background
that's just my husband and my daughter
they're putting together some stuff for
the hundredth day of school first of all
what does have you happy valentines day
I'm not sure if that's gonna go right
before Valentine's Day are right after
but I hope you have a great day I am
going to shoot my winter favorites video
and I wanted to also review a product
that I got recently I just got this
palette by BH Cosmetics called forever
nude and i figured i would review this
and get ready at the same time so we can
just discuss and kill two birds with one
stone you know I'm saying so let me just
talk about the packaging real quick I do
not care for this packaging at all it is
straight up plastic it reminds me of
just a cheap um you know plastic that
you might get in with a child's make up
inside this palette you yet no no no no
all these beautiful colors you get six
shadows a highlight to lip products and
to blush colors this on my lid these two
of my crease and then this will be for a
brow bone highlight and then I don't
know which blush i'm gonna pick i'll
play it by ear will see will play with
the blushes we'll do it together for
lips i'm probably i don't know will play
with them we'll see how it goes my
routine that I always do I always wash
my Beauty Blender I actually really like
this solid better than the liquid that I
had it really it cleans it better this
is not a Beauty Blender though this is
the real techniques sponge love this
thing it is now my holy grail applicator
for face makeup but before we do that I
had a lovely subscriber of mine
recommend using the Revlon age-defying
wrinkle remedy line filler for pores so
I'm gonna go ahead and start with that
I'll to put on the rest of my makeup and
see if I can see a difference with the
poor thing I feel like like pores look
bigger on the side mostly see him on my
cheeks for primer today because I'm
always looking to review new things i
did get this sephora primer foundation
primer and it was like a 500-point perk
she get like a mystery bag of what must
have item has never tried it before it's
like a creamy consistency smells really
funky I do not like the smell at all oh
I got some of my eye oh that burns see
you guys get to see what I go through
where were you um it dried really fast
so there's no boil eNOS to it we'll see
if it helps my makeup stay longer if
it's if it's wonderful let you know if
if not if it's not wonderful then just
take that as a scrap because the smell
is really disturbing on to foundation or
I've been using a lot of BB creams
lately I haven't been loving the full
coverage foundation look for some reason
so I mix these two colors of ponds maybe
come together this is the medium and the
life just put like a glob just a little
glob there of the medium and then i put
a little glob of the light and that's
playing for my whole face I don't like
the whole mask face like do you guys
ever feel like the people at Mac and
sometimes it's a for that they just look
to made up on especially Mac I feel like
it's like what really I know you work in
a makeup store but I don't want to look
like you I really don't
sometimes I put my concealer on first
sometimes I put my concealer on after my
foundation I'm trying to use up this
Revlon each to find concealer oh I don't
know if you can see that but it's
starting to separate inside the tube so
I'm going to try to use that up okay so
because i'm using i just use a very
little bit of concealer sometimes i like
to use this to kind of bump it up
especially since i'm filming I want to
make sure I want to have a little bit
more of a full coverage foundation look
so I'm gonna use this mary kay mineral
powder foundation it's very very sheer
to me on its own but paired over ably be
cream I really like it so I just tap a
little into the cabin and this is my
favorite favorite favorite face brush
this is the it cosmetics face brush is
it all over face brush let the luck
something or another I gone in a New BTW
test tube and i love it you can come in
and sing if you want to and won't come
in single day I know what he's talking
about something about chocolate I don't
know alright but anyway so I just kind
of Pat that down i try not to like sweep
it because i feel like that brushes it
just right also i tried to just Pat it
in and this really mattifies my face and
gives me a really nice finish to put on
my fabulous awesome anti-aging a primer
by urban decay I can already see I'm
starting to get dead in this I've been
using it o Allah I just put the tiniest
tiniest tiniest little bit now we are
ready to jump into this so we're going
to go straight into the light purple all
over the lid this one y'all
and you can see it's not very pigmented
so there is a finger swatch of that
there's a hand swatch not very pigmented
we're gonna work with it we're going to
work with it yeah I don't even know can
you even see I put anything on like I
can't even see it not happy with this
shade at all so what I'm gonna do to
spruce it up a little bit because this
one is a little more pigmented I'm just
gonna add this one on top but now the
purple was completely gone so if I
wasn't just doing just the look from
this palette I would definitely be
putting something else on my lids but
I'm not so let me show you the finger
swatch for this one so this one's also a
little powdery but I think it's better
than the purple oh there's that so one
thing I've been doing a lot lately that
has really changed my eyeshadow look is
just working into my crease and not
darkening the outer corner and I've been
getting a lot of compliments from you
all since then so I'm going to go ahead
and do that today I'm going to use this
warm brown down here
now to add a little bit of fun i'm going
to add this pink here just add a little
extra dimension i'm going to bring that
down onto my lid just a tad bit and out
into the outer corner
so these are the finger swatches of
those two colors those are much more
pigmented I like those a lot still a
very natural look I'm gonna kind of go
like this a little bit to make sure
nothing goes below this line because I
think it looks really weird if i have i
shudda that goes too low so i just kind
of do a little Rubby Rubby fashion oh by
the way this right here is the Real
Techniques base shadow brush I love love
love love love this brush it came in the
eye shadow brush set by Real Techniques
I don't know if you can buy this
individually or not but I love this
program this one here i'm going to use
to do some definite some defining it
this is a shader brush by ecotools love
ego tools brushes a lot of people don't
know that ego tools is actually owned by
the st. well Real Techniques is owned by
the same company as eco tools into this
bottom one it's kind of a last-minute
choice to just give my eyes a little
more definition because I feel like
since i'm filming i want to have just a
little more color so I'm just gonna go
just a straight line into my crease this
is straight absolute straight no joke
straight line I'm gonna bring that up on
my brow bone just a tiny bit
it's a little dark right now so I'm
gonna blend it out yes I'm actually
bringing up for review this is an
everyday minerals brush that I just got
and I forget what this one's called it's
not labeled on here but it's just a
fluffy brush I got in this Mirabella one
in a beauty box and it's a lot like this
one it's way too fluffy to really pack
on any shadow but it's really nice for
blue so I'm just gonna go back into this
color I can actually just use this
highlight color as well but I'm gonna
just use this one and just add some
highlight on the top and then kind of
blend this in a little bit to get rid of
any harsh lines
and that is my finished eyeshadow okay
so now that we're done with with uh I
shadow let's move into eyeliner and this
if you watched my twenty question BTW
tag this is my new Holy Grail liquid
eyeliner and this is the master precise
by Maybelline love this
so now that I've got my bass down for
the eyeliner I like to kind of go go
into the corner of my eye and then flip
it up just a little bit I don't like a
crazy wing I just like a little tiny bit
that way it's it's subtle but it's still
winged out just a little bit I'm not one
is people get away with those big huge
wings I just look stupid so I just
realize those making the eyeliner face
you guys make the eyeliner face when
you're putting on eyeliner and mascara
okay
now I'm gonna do a little flippy on this
side just a little bit okay so there we
go I actually got this i might as well
use it for the video this is a brand new
mascara by BH Cosmetics and it's the
lovable lash mascara and true alack it
is a dryer formula so there is the Wan
there so I'm not sure if you can see but
I have basically like no dashes oh
nothing ain't nothing there my friend
I'm gonna go ahead and apply
so it separates really really nicely
adds a little bit of length a little bit
of volume but it's not a spectacular
mascara
sukkot number two
so minimally clumpy um just a tad bit a
little bit lengthening I would say it's
more lengthening than volumizing but I
mean it's a decent mascara I'm not gonna
complain about it but I definitely not
gonna rape about to eat my brands are
driving me bonkers I don't know if
they're driving you bonkers for the
driving me bonkers we're gonna attack
the brows next so this is my new
anastacio brow dip brow in chocolate and
when I first started using it i was
using a brush like this like just a
little angle brush and i realized that
that was making me look like um my
subscribers said a drag queen uh-huh is
the way it was making her look it
definitely has that it's very very sharp
and you have to be one of those people
that could pull off that really sharp
brow and I don't think I'm one of those
people so what I started doing was using
more of a fluffy angled brush this is
the Real Techniques brow brush and that
came in that kit as well here's that and
I just dip just kind of Pat it in and
then I just pat pat pat pat and then
from here on I draw it there we go a
difference right I have this little
teeny tiny Mary case fully that I got
from that chick Jen um forget what her
last name was sent me a bunch of of mary
kay stuff and then she doesn't sell mary
kay anymore which makes me sad you
definitely need to spoil eight through
to kind of blend it but don't go crazy
with the spoolie because if you go I've
done this we go crazy with this bully
and then you end up with product like
way up here so you got to just be gentle
with the spoolie ok so there we go i
mean big difference right
I should have done my brows earlier
because that was just crazy looking the
other thing that shocked me bonkers is
my lips because my lips feel like super
draw I did get this BH Cosmetics of Lux
crema Lux lipstick and this one is in
tea time I'm gonna go ahead and use that
actually i'm going to moisturize first
my lips or super drawers or just Burt's
Bees whatever Oh clump city I haven't
used this yet it's like calm fitting I
guess I needed to exfoliate first time
okay so I exfoliated and now I'm back
because that was just that was not good
okay let's try again let's give let's
give it a real chance here that's better
all right much better that wasn't the
products fault that was me not
exfoliating my lips so and really all I
did to exfoliate was I just took a wet
paper towel and I just rubbed it on my
lips and then I use the dry part and I
rubbed it some more and just try to get
some of that skin off I actually have so
a company that's sending me some lip
exfoliator zai can't remember the name
of the company I'll put it here they're
sending a couple of lip exfoliating a
product so those are coming from for
review whatever I get get them in the
mail so those there's that and then now
we will all I forgot I was gonna use the
lip products in here aw man why can use
it as a gloss let me show you what the
lip products look like in here okay so
those are the two swatches of the lip
product so very very very pigmented this
one's a little too much for me but i'll
put that over talk sorry about that guys
palette fail i forgot there were lip
products in here anyway i'll put the
lighter one I'm gonna put this more
neutral one over top
but you can't see it because I have that
lip color on I'm sorry about that you
guys but you saw its watches ah this my
first get ready with me ah fail so now
let's try the cheap products let's use
this one first though the kinkier one
very sheer what do you think is it sheer
yeah pretty sheer
I can't see it can you yeah that's not
working let me use a more dense brush
when I have a sheer of cheek product I'd
like to use just this flat top brush and
see if that can do some damage here
still pretty sheer oh no you can see it
a little bit let's try this one just for
fun let's add a little bit of that one I
feel like I should be painted by now I
should look like a clown with how much
product i'm putting on so not impressed
with the blushes ok so the swatches are
on my ring finger and my pinky finger
this is the right thing and that's the
Mavi one earning a Squatch space so yeah
not very impressed with my friends over
the highlight i'm going to go back in
with this um this everyday minerals
brush since i only like a little bit of
a highlight and that's actually flying
pretty nicely it's a matte highlight I
mean it's I don't know
just looks like a face powder oh no did
it highlight what do you think there's
the swatch of the highlight so it's just
a powder really wouldn't really call
that a highlight so for somebody with a
darker skin tone this will be probably a
nice highlight maybe medium to be a
medium skin tone but for my light medium
skin tone this is not it's not working
for me the only one I didn't use was
this one up here it's actually very
similar to this one it's just more of a
multi so as you can see there isn't too
much of a difference I mean there's
definitely a difference but I don't know
yeah so I mean as far as this palette
goes I honestly even for the price would
not recommend it I don't feel like it's
got enough usable products in there i
feel like the blushes are a bust for me
the highlights of bust this purple
shadow is a bust this one's okay but
pretty much a bust really the prettiest
shadows i think in here are are these
here but these two are very similar lip
products are pretty nice but honestly
i'm not a fan of lip products in a pan
because i'm not going to take this with
me anywhere so it's just for one
application but they're okay and the
blushes are a bus for me so i would not
recommend this one the one I'm okay I'm
happy with my face but there's so much
better products out there gonna get
something from bhcosmetics this I love
if you like colors this is the galaxy
check or galaxy chic palette still don't
know how to say but that one's really
good BH Cosmetics has some really good
products but this to me is not one of
them so I hope that was helpful for you
