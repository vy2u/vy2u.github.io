it's crap definitely sure okay I'm so
happy to see all of the context is for
the show make some noise
[Laughter]
there are so many Beauty influenced this
was pretty easy I'm a lot of them were
hand-picked by Nene and Kim and you know
the whole idea of the show came about by
he wasn't even amazing how the makeup
artist I was behind on it they wanted to
be discovered like Kardashian of work on
their clan spot and that's how the
showing you came about it was really
honoring and showcasing amazing artists
talent that on social media this is like
an amazing new protocol showcase terkoz
and
everybody please simmer down we're
talking and we would love to have your
attention I think it's a great age for
beauty because it's a self-improvement
age we all want to look better and feel
better and we're always on the like
what's the next - know that you know
highlight my eye is better or my cheeks
and contour my nose better I want my
nose to disappear what's the latest
happens about it so I think it's like a
great age for people wanting to
self-improve
I think that's why the media she's
moving so much
to make sense of each yet it's a
background that we were the only people
really talking about beauty and giving
it back and today there's all of these
people in this room millions and
millions around the world giving and you
just easy in the station appetite
exactly like you said
it's a watch people like enemy platform
there was no place for people to share
their love of makeup artistry unless you
were a professional makeup artist and
your work was featured in a magazine or
on a celebrity that was the only way
you're working every showcase and now it
is commonplace that you can make youtube
videos you can post on Instagram you can
have your own successful career in so
many different ways
I think it's encouraged so many people
makeup artistry is a real career habit
is it the future and I've been for a
year and I'd be like why isn't there a
big of a competition show like a
special-effects makeup when you started
did you think that you
no I think there was no from YouTube
when I started there was always max like
oh I wish you could teach me how to make
them I wish you see how thank you guys
for doing this shushing to the louder
people in the back but I think that I
had no idea that that would be something
it just became like I knew I had a best
friend that was on the internet thanks
oh I love that you helped me learn that
and that was sharing and it was I wanted
to make people feel beautiful and teach
them what I knew how to so that you
don't even grew and there's more people
doing YouTube or Instagram listen even
around them but just see that this is
grown and it really is a community of
people you feel like are your friends
about your family like you love makeup
too you love this passion you love this
artistry and we can encourage each other
we can do this together I love show
that's gonna showcase every single
person I feel this way about makeup the
artistry of it the creativity even the
therapy of doing makeup sometime have a
bad day just couldn't make up on to the
time where you're quiet
nobody's bothering you you can just
relax and just blend you know there's
the energy in the magic of the show
don't you like candies right now and you
just thanks man and it's just it's the
love it really is the love that all of
our brilliant contestants brought in all
their brilliant ideas Frank now
something that I love about this show is
it's a reality competition show it's fun
to watch but it also really puts out the
message that the definition of community
has changed it's not just standard
beauty so I would love it's going to go
down the line and hear from each of you
what your definition like it sounds so
corny but I always think it comes from
inside because they think we on the show
we really are looking at the
execution of the makeup and we're really
particular no but at the end of the day
whatever you're rocking oh it feel it
and live it love it and it's about how
you feel about yourself and then people
feel that when you are owning your look
even if it's not quite for many years
but man lovely am a Korean people
without that and people felt the
aspiration of it all so that's for me
and the beauty is about owning whatever
it is you're rocking and rocking it's
hard I feel like I always say I feel
like beauty is something that should be
felt in a dark room where you can't see
a thing it should be that something if
there's an energy that people come with
is you if you're unique something that's
different the imperfections are
beautiful I love a woman with no makeup
in a shaved head I think that's
beautiful just as beautiful and a bunch
of hair and the point of eyelashes the
beauty is something that comes in that
continents like I'm fabulous how I am
and whatever that look is anybody you've
got that inside its gonna absolute radio
and it's interesting aside were the most
beautiful models in the world and you
can help they're not happy on the inside
on the outside I any lock there is no
there is no debate in that when you're
happy on the inside and you're super
confident it's gonna show on the outside
and also they feel like it's what you
put into like from what you eat you know
and when I eat bound you see it on my
skin the makeup no matter how much
layers not gonna work so I always like
you know drinking water hydrating but
Europe if you don't feel good you walk
out of the house no matter what you wear
and how much think it's the best makeup
or do your makeup it's just not going to
super eat that because you're just gonna
feel like those days where you have
all that makeup you walk out I just not
feeling it so it's confidence for me
it's beauty I think it's lost on many
people in this room and TV industry that
the host is a trans woman of color but
she was very significant really quick
what's really great about this show and
this stage in my career is that yes I'm
trans and vocally trans I'm proud of
that I own that this there is more to me
than that and we get to I to be a host
of a show and and be irreverent and fun
and critique the heck out of makeup and
do it with a lot of love and a lot of
knowledge and so yes I'm trans but now
life but what else are you
I get out in Ankara the widows are you
gonna bring to the table right and I
think that is what all of you are about
it's like what else do you bring
honestly I went into the show saying I'm
going to have the time of my life and
I'm gonna give my life I don't know if
anybody's gonna watch the show after you
have a show like a year ago I was
promoting your show that was cancelled
after two episodes that is doing it for
real
like after that experience that's like
all I really have is the experience to
have with the people that I'm working
with and the fun that I have in so we
had so much fun are these judges are
incredible they know their I'm
gonna curse their they're fun and
smart and I just had so much fun cooter
I mean now okay so I should have created
a little Coast character who's maybe get
cross between RuPaul hi
like I always say it's really silly I'd
like to read a feeling on the show but
also I think I can find a really silly
with like understanding how big this is
for everything in contention it was on
the show and how many opportunities in
so I want to combine the seriousness of
it for the contentions with having a
whole lot of month so I hope you get it
like we were having a ball and that we
weren't all way too serious and ever we
get your lives character that you
created I wasn't going to ask what your
influences work and actually everyone
you just said it's amazing if you have
all these amazing people who've done it
before you you might as well be
influenced by them and you know
invitations for me but I hope it's like
a hodgepodge of all those people and a
little bit of Luverne - I think any
point just seeing a librarian of
resource and anology be like how does
she know this and remember this and
every day she would have a way that you
tie in Mariah Carey we didn't make it to
the cut the wheel came up every daily
between glitter of butterflies every bit
was always Mariah all the time
evaluation
I really saw with reading the first
episode of each judge brings a very
different perspective which i think is
very interesting so maybe one of you
what you think you bring and also I love
to hear from handy and Zanna just your
perspective and what you bring because
Zanna you've done other reality
competition series and this is a
different one yeah Candide we spoke a
bit about obviously where you started
but I'm curious if this was almost
challenging to critique people who came
up and who are coming up in the same
moment you came up it yeah I think it
was hard because I know everybody three
you know as a missive artists eyes
that's what I wanted you know a teenager
and so it's I know these and that's
their dream and so dear to them so even
when I wanted to help improve something
or see an area I can see improvement I
don't want to crush anyway three and
four
like anything look like it's negative
everything can be worked on in be
improved upon so for me I was hoping
that I could just incredible to be the
best and impart some wisdom or tips or
ways they could strengthen and grow
because I felt like everybody was like
my little children or something on the
show like I wanted every way to do so
well if I wanted everybody to go on and
make their dreams happen and we were
crying with like I mean there was three
elimination the show right the
eliminations like oh it was so hard
I really hope every single makeup artist
if you were eliminated on the show I
hope that that you use that as fuel to
get better at your craft that it was
good to know that that is not the end if
you didn't quite you know make it as far
as you want to on this show I can't tell
you how many I told I think I said this
if you'd be on the show can't tell you
how many times I've told you know you're
a black trans that transgender woman
there is no way you're gonna be able to
have one career that working action but
I didn't give up and don't ever ever
give up what we must make smartest in
the world I've interviewed investment
school and a beauty company co-founder
it's a we create on it so I've been
around YouTube who stole my makeup done
a million times but it's all about that
over scenes I think not I won't be best
of the best so I really think I bring
it's a really interesting for we're so
much more to measure a show in terms of
fun and social awareness you think that
having these contestants to in this
water
do you think that our beauty instances
and have these stink platforms online do
you think that that brings my battery
started with a body for sentimentality
what I think it's so incredible about
the influencer world is that it's really
the public and particularly young people
trunk influences where the main try
playing actresses on television in books
have so much power and for me I'm
endlessly fascinated by that I'm
endlessly into to bring that to
television it's really exciting to me to
preach those world I think everybody's
gone into like a you choose a hole where
all of us that you're watching one
makeup tutorial then you're watching 60
and it's just this thing where they can
begin you get the makeup tutorials with
your inning story time but their lives
and like you gets to know people in your
best fitted it's like it's a whole thing
if they're like you want to be able to
bring a little bit of not to and telling
me if I'm poor tradition elephant and
politician reality show but that you got
you're changing the culture you're
changing it right now and that is epic
and we honor that and I checked my
battery done that
everybody on the idea came about I've
always worked with amazing talented
makeup artists that I would find on
Instagram just like you guys I know
there's a couple I also know from its
throughout that body so I work with them
today would always come in to do my
makeup and for my shows and they would
always see the same thing I don't want
to discover it I would his sorry some
had insane following it's like massive
and they would come to my makeup and the
makeup was kind of like good on the
program in it it's all filters at BC
right some artists come in and had like
300 male they are so talented
I'm like okay you need to be the
photographer I like so I need to find
you like how do we get you like
discovery because they are so towns they
really true artists and you know that's
all this show came about is like show
taking art and when you guys watch the
show is have you seen the first episode
you guys really see art form it's like
it's not just makeup and I think for
anybody who's not into maple who's gonna
watch the show they're gonna take away
some amazing tips from Rivera and candy
and data and Mario like there's so much
you learned from the show and I kind of
wonder this should be something for my
mom who was like what's contour and oh
my god the fact I want you to watch it
and I wanted to be something for amazing
artists that are here that are gonna
showcase their talent and everybody
wanted to like be on Kim's lab spot when
they would come to my makeup so I told
Kim like aunt Kim like everybody keeps
coming and is like the secret
competition is there got to be
discovered by you you know they're all
wearing wigs like you're waiting they're
going to pick up the outfit I'm like
there's something here and the time
we're going to lunch
it's been like three years in the making
so excited to be here at Edition makeup
collection for it's really it's amazing
the stock you've been wanting to work
with her and we're giving the
opportunity to do not Kim obviously
every episode begin with these precious
selfie challenge and the green adele
fees yeah she's a revolutionize the art
board and though dining talk about
things in will and g she is her shopping
you know she is you know I love about it
and overtaking that she's a hard worker
and a successful she is she doesn't
think like oh I don't have to do that
look she's very involved very passionate
about anything she puts her game on and
especially
well and we were so excited over when he
like came on board we were so excited
yeah I think the judge process that we
were so excited and I know she is GOI
thrilled but the Shogun is it's her
world like she knows it inside and out
and she's in a really good job
influencing makeup you know I remember
what's contour used to be at night like
the cosmic rays and I wanted to ask the
panel what do you think that the
Kardashians has done for beauty because
I think they've really changed in a way
like female empowerment in the way that
people I think it's for me a target of
bullies that's now cuz we're deep in it
you know I think between I live kids and
Kim's you know contour kit that I make
up my mind it's just exploding I mean
she influenced an entire generation
there's a generation of young girls who
want to be heard what I look like her
that that it's almost impossible to
quantify but named you look at the
numbers everything is selling out and
everybody is sort of emulating I think
that sort of in spreads out I think if
you I was just at the store before I
came out here I was like I don't know
why I'm socks and this trip out here
whatever and the girl in the story she
was like oh my gosh I saw you're doing
this show thank you
Kim's doing something and and is she
nice what if she like she like she's my
queen I love everything she does and she
was like I was dining her entire
Instagram seriously did you see
had two bikes it's a beautiful car and I
feel like it really was more than
magazines that people would look out for
trends they would look at you know I
really feel that Kim became she set a
mold where she's doing different things
and I think that she looked beautiful
inspired by all right now we are just
going to go to a few audience questions
but first just for fun I want to know
each of your either favorite beauty
product you can't live without or okay
we'll stay with this and then I'm gonna
turn it off so I'm about to I don't want
to mess up because mine would be looking
a little bit wrong grunts so this email
makeup and stick it's called matte
bronzer and I applied just leave my
cheekbones on the go anywhere three
minutes like three seconds flat melding
my palms my wrist and on the forehead
where the Sun hits ten to the second
ready in a flash do not need anything
else well do something else
are you going to fix those island I'm
gonna go with the beauty tool because I
think the beauty blender has really
revolutionized like the beauty
application and I mean I think my
battery was just checked I can't leave
the United Beauty my drive but I'm gonna
cook through the web you know I read the
lady this is weird but I really found
the suit
well last year I found that I'm gluten
intolerant and that the lipstick that
because I stopped eating gluten and then
like seven months later I'm still in my
system so my bloodstream and my doctor
said it could be your lipstick yeah so
now I think I use we only use
gluten-free and vegan let's jail
so that infants event through really the
crucial and milk using milk milk
lipsticks and oh my god that crayons and
lip crayon and then also bite our two
products that we've been using a lot of
because then I'll fight that's great I
like the more threads in the fall as
well it's so glued the glue free if
you're having gluten issues your
lipstick make sure it's gluten free
things people never knew right cuz we
eat goose and kind of eat the lipstick
eat up my lipstick every year every year
not you know on purpose but like I would
say what are you kidding me and so now
you have to make sure that your lipstick
is gluten-free and ideally be good and
cruelty for you to I'm really big on
skincare and I do something really crazy
I always thought like once every couple
months to Koreatown in LA and I buy the
cream cheese face mask like snake better
face mask and snail collagen face mask
I've had a sense a mask on my face that
I do the craziest best of I think that I
cannot put my makeup on one of these
masks what's your favorite what's your
favorite I love this PL collagen and it
it makes your skin glow it brightens up
the skin hashtag snail collagen if
they're Bigler brand if nail color
I have a trial I have it where can I
find that okay if I can understand a
word but it's not right one shot of the
crew it's a hybrid speaking cruelty-free
year all right I gotta shut this off
this is gonna die anyone in I don't want
it not to render because my battery dies
