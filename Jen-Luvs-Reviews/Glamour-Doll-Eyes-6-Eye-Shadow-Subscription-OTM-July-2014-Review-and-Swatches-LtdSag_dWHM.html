eyes this is my of the month
subscription from glamour doll eyes I
really really enjoyed the subscription
and this is unfortunately though my last
one for a few months I just need to take
a break from a couple of my
subscriptions so that i can try some new
ones but glimmered all eyes will be back
in a few months with the otm i believe
in november so without further ado let
me show you what we got this month this
is a beautiful black and white bag
usually the bag matches the eyeshadows
that are inside so I think that'll be
interesting if we got a black and white
eyeshadow that will be very very
interesting glamour doll eyes is six to
eight dollars a month depending on how
you sign up for it it is very difficult
to sign up for it it's a very small
company so it's really hard to get a
subscription to it you know put the
information down below you can sign up
for their otm emails and it will notify
you when they're coming out with new
subscription this here is what you get
you get a little pouch and then inside
you get at least one glamour doll eyes
eyeshadow and a little bonus extra also
there's usually some kind of candy
confection inside so let's see what I
pull out first and the first thing I
pull out is one of my favorite things
ever candy bracelets this action will
probably end up going to my six-year-old
daughter Lila because this is more
something that she would like but then
things that I give it to her then I
leave one and my son John is gonna do
like I get a candy Branson so I don't
know well I'll make sure the kids what
this somehow but I absolutely love these
things and this is by love beads candy
charm bracelet and the next thing I'm
pulling out on the little cards I
believe they're affiliated with pseudo
in a lace so we always get us to do a
lace card and then we got a Hello waffle
cosmetics that is an awesome name for a
cosmetic company hello waffles I never
would have thought of that in a million
years that's really funny cats and fairy
tales this is a very eccentric person i
can tell thank you for ten percent off
your next purchase use code thank you
instagram is Sir waffle lot I'm going to
follow them on Instagram just because I
am so curious I so we must have
something from
I'm in here and get to glamour doll eyes
business cards with cute chick on the
back and then we get the card that
explains everything that is in here so
I'm going to hold off on that for just a
moment until I can see what is in here
and the first thing I see is the little
extra and this says a spellbound lip
glaze flavor is birthday cake and it's
vegan and it's a sample I don't mind
getting lip gloss samples and that's
what I have trouble with is when there's
aa shadows in these things like loose
pigment eyeshadows so much trouble with
that so let's see what we got going on
here it's aight the Pantone color of the
year it's a little gooey pigmentation is
definitely there it's got a lipstick
kind of texture and it's got but it's
got a shine to it like a lip gloss cool
should I put it on should I try it let's
try it this is the new toothpaste powder
foundation that I'm trying out i'm just
going to use the mirror for it i'm gonna
tell you more about this after tried i
only used it once so i don't feel
comfortable viewing it yet but i'm just
using a mirror that looks cool of course
i already had lip product on but we have
to know the stickiness to it at all and
it's just a really pretty color I had
such a nude color on before this that I
think I'll be fine but as far as finding
the true color of this but whoo that
feels good I like that I think I can
rock this even though I'm not really a
big fan of the bright colors I think I
can totally rock this and I I bet you
this will build up nicely as well I mean
look at that that is some crazy
pigmentation so this is actually I'm
actually very excited about this I'm
surprised because when I first saw the
color wasn't excited about it but now
that I have it on I really like it shop
all that chump all that sass I
accidentally didn't put the S on the
front and did that and that did not come
out something that I'm allowed to say
all that spelled out a vibrant pinky
purple with gold sparkles and a
chocolate cake flavor it does have a
chocolate cake flavor isn't that nice
but yeah sweet bonus total bonus ok but
anyway alright so let's pull out the
glamour doll eyes eye shadows next
them in here it looks like we've got to
glamorize I shadows this month which is
awesome and a little extra bonus sample
so we did get black and white and this
one is in under the moon and these are
typically exclusive to the subscription
meaning that you can't get them unless
you get them in the subscription alright
this is really cool looking you gotta
check this out ok so that's what that
looks like it looks like a not even
really a black it's like a gray with
some sparkles in it like a deep gray
just actually well I have my the lip
gloss on there so I won't do that like
that there's that whoa-ho it comes out
like almost purple cool very similar
kind of blend it out a little bit that's
cool it looks like the sparkles stay
whether or not you blend it with a brush
or not they're definitely more highly
concentrated in this of course but
that's a really cool coat is so high
near my hair is like Frison and I'm
sweating hmm okay let me see what
glamour doll eyes describes this as
matte black bass with a purple sheen and
goldish green Sparkle I think this would
be really good for like evening out
smoking out the outer quarter that kind
of thing maybe on the lower lash line
may be wet and put on as a liner I think
would be cool so definitely something
that i will be using and excited about i
love how glamour doll eyes puts these
very unique sparkles and glitters into
their shadows to make them so complex
that you just can't find them just in
regular palettes and they're they're so
different than other mineral eye shadows
that I've seen I just very very creative
in the color combinations that Vanessa
who is the owner of glamour eyes comes
up with I mean just really really cool
one thing I forgot to mention is I do
receive this as a promotional
subscription that doesn't influence my
review at so I've washed I wiped off the
lip gloss so that I can try out the
white eyeshadow and this one is in
crystal ball which makes me think it's
going to have some really cool
letters in it and it does i wonder how
this compares from the unicorn one they
sent it looks like comparing the two
this is vanilla unicorn that we got
another month this one looks like that
the glitter in here is a little more
prominent it's a little more pinky where
this one's a little more iridescent okay
so this is what crystal ball looks like
in the pan and go here is thing gah oh
look at that pink oh love that oh my
gosh oh oh I was not expecting that look
at that wow that is gorgeous Samson
you're expecting it to be like white
like powerful white and it's actually
pink it's an iridescent pink that is so
cool okay so this is the crystal ball
and that's vanilla unicorn so you can
see the difference in the two completely
completely different okay so let me read
this to you it says this month were
featuring two shadows from a mother and
daughter team Cheryl and Raven crystal
ball is Cheryl's color and a second
color is under the moon which is Ravens
and it talks about the matte black bass
with the purple Sheen and the goldish
sparkle but then it doesn't talk about
what they call the the other one but
that's okay I can see as pink iridescent
awesomeness is the name is how I would
describe that color really cool and then
they gave us an extra little sample of
this one this is called a theory old
voice ethereal is a very popular word
apparently in the makeup world see a
serial everywhere so that is and that
one on is the finger and then let's see
if we can scoot that up look at that
it's going to be a gorgeous crease color
beautiful absolutely beautiful I just
want to show you out in the Sun like
just like last month just how stinking
gorgeous these things are in the
sunlight look at how they sparkle like
I'm dying over here like I am seriously
like makeup addicts everywhere on your
stand what I'm talking about what I'm
like
telling you how in love I am with these
shadows oh my God look at that they're
so pretty ethereal voice is described as
it's a warm purple with golden shimmer
is how they describe that one fellow
waffle is a company based in Canada
they're fairly new company for our
Canadian subscribers and their colors
are beautiful she sent along a sample
baggie for you to try oh I see this
ethereal voice is from Hello waffle I
get it now this is from Hello waffle and
it is stinking gorgeous sweetie
unbelievable and and this is the thing
about glamour doll eyes is they do sell
a lot of shadows on their website just
outright I think there's six bucks
apiece which i think is a fair price for
them especially with how unique the
colors are you're not going to be able
this isn't something where you like I
have a color just like it in my
collection like that has not happened to
me with like stammering doll eyes eye
shadows so definitely check out their
website even if you don't do the
subscription service I would highly
recommend you at least go and look at
their shadows and see if anything calls
to you they have collections of groups
of Shadows they have individual shadows
that they sell and they're just really
high quality they're always really
pigmented and and so unique i mean
vanessa is a color genius I swear so
overall really really happy with his
subscription I'm very sad to put it on
hold but the fact that you guys can't
really subscribe to it very easily makes
me want to take a little bit of a break
from it that's that's honestly the big
reason why I'm taking a break in a few
months I'll have some new subscribers
that have it hasn't haven't ever seen it
to expose you but y'all have already
seen it so we'll just hold off for a
couple of months for this thank you so
