month the glamour doll eyes now I know
I'm sorry I ok this is what happened I
decided that I'm going to take a little
break from glamour doll eyes because I
have a lot of companies that are
contacting me wanting me to review new
subscription boxes for you scratch the
nail company there's a couple of other
ones that are going to be coming up that
I want to review and I can only fit in
so many reviews of subscription boxes a
month I got to put in some other stuff
too so I'm going to take a little break
from glamour doll eyes for just a few
months but it will be back yeah I
believe this is june i'll get you lie
and then this isn't my last one because
i'm gonna get july I'll take a break for
August September in October and then
I'll get a new one in at November so my
time with liberalise is limited I'm
sorry I have to do it but I want to show
oh my gosh so you Nellie do this they do
this and they make think they make me
want to stay subscribed this is so
stinking cute oh my goodness it's almost
like a little mini half-size epsy bag by
the way I've done so many of these box
openings I forget to tell you what the
deal is with the glimmer eyes is six
dollars a month for the it's likes
between six and eight dollars a month
including shipping depending on how you
sign up for it it is very tricky to sign
up for it I they are shipping
internationally go ahead and look down
below in the description and I'll have
some information down there also there's
gonna be some information on the glamour
twice website there's like a window of
when you can sign up for it and I think
they only have like 20 or 30 new
subscriptions every month that open ups
you've got to be like on there at the
right time to get the subscription but I
do want to show you what we got for june
so let's just go ahead and get into that
well if you have any other questions
about it you can ask them below or you
can check the glam relies website so
this is so stinkin cute this actually
will be really good to put my glasses in
even though it doesn't feel like it's
going to be hard just to protect them
you know in my purse could that be cool
ah let's tell my gosh I just did a
hatchery unboxing and I'm telling you my
mouth was already on fire and let me get
these Hot Tamales I'm not eating me I'm
not eating these things I'm like dying I
just drank a whole cup of milk like I
have my mouth is on fire so thank you
for these but I'm gonna be passing me so
handsome I can't take these things no
Jews spicy they always put in some kind
of candy in there they put these
Lancaster can caramels in once they were
so good okay so the first thing I'm
seeing innocent twisted alchemy
storenvy.com I'll put up with a link
down below in case you're interested in
this what is this there's there's a card
in here that explains what things are is
it a powder is it a liquid what is this
it's a powder let's look and see we
always gets to do in a lace cards I
guess they're affiliated ah they got
this cute chick on the back she's
probably YouTube person I would imagine
lamberto eyes pigments of your
imagination doll eyes okay here we go so
twisted twist innocent twisted
storenvy.com candied violet deep blue
violet with red Sheen and has copper
shimmers okay so it looks like it is a
shadow I would imagine I'm so scared to
open in this thing because I don't want
to spill it everywhere oh my gosh I'm
gonna spill this everywhere ah don't
spill please don't spill okay I managed
not to spill it yet oh my gosh I just
spilled it okay this is not a good
packaging it's a powder that's that's
not a good packaging all right so anyway
let me show you what I was able to
manage to get off get out of the pan
there so there is that whoa holy good
Jolie that's cool looking it's very goth
all right I'm just gonna get a little
close one of my subscribers was like why
don't you do brush swatches because we
don't put eyeshadow on with our fingers
why do we why don't why you always just
putting a finger swatch I'm like oh
that's a good point so let's see if I
could do this one more time without
spilling it will do a brush to watch
hold it is Jolie oh my gosh hmm this is
just a generic flat brush interesting
that is crazy it's like when you blend
it out this is actually thank you for
that I forget who it was see look look
at the difference between the brush
swatch and the finger swatch totally
different in what you end up getting and
I it's funny because I'm not very good
with names but I can picture her face
zend early I think it was end early yes
generally she's the one who suggested
that I do that and I'm very thankful
thank you hun because the brush watch
and the finger swatch are totally
different I would imagine that if you
pack the color you'll be able to get the
same as the finger swatch with all the
glitters and everything but this makes
me not confident that the glitters will
stay it looks like a brassy kind of
glitter I've a feeling that those would
probably fall away over the day so
that's really good to know try keep
moving on moving home so next we got the
this is the glamour doll eyes eyeshadow
and this one is in prime suspect
specifically for jun 2014 this is a
limited edition just for this month for
the subscription and it is a bright
bright pink very pretty okay there's
finger swatch beautiful very nice okay
breasts watch looks very similar I'm try
to blend it a little bit that's cool
though girlfriend I'm gonna be doing
this forever see look how that's more
purpley and then when you use the brush
it turns more red are you guys seeing
that too I mean this one's going to be a
really nice one for darkening the outer
corner for that nighttime smokey eye
look maybe even for some lower lower
lashline maybe even some eyeliner where
that would look really pretty and this
one here I can see using that on kind of
the outer third of my eye to kind of add
a little bit of a pop of color I
wouldn't use this on a lower lash line
cuz I would have be afraid it would make
my eye look bloody but um yeah there's
it's funny it's crazy because there's an
iridescent to this swatch but then the
iridescent is gone when you blend it out
that's so interesting so I just wanted
to show you how beautiful the shadows
look and the Sun
I mean just absolutely gorgeous you see
the shimmers I mean even in the brush
watch you can see how gorgeous the
glitter is in these absolutely beautiful
I didn't feel like my video really
captured that so I wanted to shoot this
as a little supplemental so now back to
the regular video overall very happy
with both even though they do change
quite a bit when they're applied with a
brush over just you know the
pigmentation is definitely there and
definitely think that this subscription
is worth six bucks so so that's
basically what you get in glamorize you
get a full-size glamour doll eyes
eyeshadow and then you get a little
bonus you get a little sample of
something or you get something from a
different company like for example this
eyes out of here so you get to try
something new and you get a full-size
glamour doll eyes eyeshadow which is
pretty cool so uh yeah so I really like
this subscription but my time is limited
with Lambert allies unfortunately I'm
gonna take a few months off so yeah but
I hope you enjoyed this video and if you
did thumbs up makes me look super cool
and makes you subscribe if you're not
already subscribed and yeah this is what
I do so if you like it subscribe mad
love to you by friends and I'll see you
in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
