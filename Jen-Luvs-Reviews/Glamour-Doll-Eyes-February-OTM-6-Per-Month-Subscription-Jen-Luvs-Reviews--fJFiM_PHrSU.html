another episode I got another eye shadow
from glamour doll eyes I am so excited
about the subscription it is really fun
out glamour doll eyes the subscription
is called otm or of the moment and I
believe that the way you sign up for is
you have to catch the subscription like
when the window opens there's like a
like a window of time where you go on
you say yes I'd like to have the
subscription think six dollars a month
and they send you a limited edition
mineral eyeshadow and it's really fun so
i'm going to show you what I got it
comes in this little package like this
and i have not opened this yet so i am
curious to see it looks like we got a
pink bag this month and last ones we got
a blue bag so i'm assuming that inside
here is going to be a pink eyeshadow
which is very wearable for me i love to
have a light pink eyeshadow on my lid
with some brown in the crease is just
gorgeous so or even grey in the crease
just oh ok this is cute first thing I
see as a pack of sugar babies love these
things this is just a little bonus extra
very cute and then this we got what is
this glamour don't eyes pigments of your
imagination is it a sticker oh it's a
sticker that's cool I don't know about
you but no matter how old I get I still
love stickers I do I love stickers and
then next we get we get some cards hail
shimmery pink with copper and gold
shifts very excited about that the
Sedona lace card in here so I don't know
if they're affiliated with so don't lace
I don't know anything by Sedona lace but
that's in here and then there's some
glamour doll eyes business cards with a
pretty chick on the back do you guys
know her is she a youtuber I don't know
ok so I'm going to put these over here
and let's read this it says this month
we're featuring a brand-new dark heart
designs a new Dark argentino was kind
enough to send along one of her shimmer
serums and centaurs wisdom alone on a
minute I gotta read this dark heart
designs ok so dark heart designs is the
name of a company and they sent us some
shimmer serum I gotta look in this and
see what's going on here ok so let's get
to the shadow first this is so
oh pretty oh my goodness this is right
up my alley it's in reckless devotion
and it says february2014 on the back
okay there's no sifter on here which
really freaks me out a little bit i wish
they would put a sifter because i feel
like i'm gonna spill it let me zoom it
in so there is the shadow kind of just
tap in their show you what that looks
like and i'll do a hand swatch in just a
second okay so let's do a hand swatch so
pretty i can definitely see the gold
flecks in there just gorgeous that's
gonna be a beautiful all over the lid
color so really excited about the shadow
just gorgeous I've never seen a shadow
quite like this before beautiful and
then this here is that serum they were
talking about i saw that in here this
right here that is so weird centaurs
wisdom liquid shimmer you're supposed to
shake well and add a few drops to your
brush and dab it on so strange-looking
it's crazy I know if you can see this
but it looks you ethereal I'm going to
say that we're right I had a video
recently why I said a wreath roll which
makes absolutely no sense because that's
so close to things that I shouldn't be
talking about in videos but this is it
looks very ethereal let's say that word
right check this out I don't know if you
can see how gorgeous that is but let's
just put a little drop it's like water
consistency safe
strange there we go there's the shimmer
on there I don't really see much in a
swatch on my hand I don't know can you
see anything going on there except for
shimmer let slip let it dry a little bit
that only feels wet so let's let it dry
um I can see like a tiny bit of sparkle
it feels almost dry at this point it's
mostly a shine I'm actually a little
disappointed in the effect of that it
was expecting to see more but you know
what I mean maybe on the lids it will
have a different effect especially with
shadows pack packed on top of it it is
pretty much dry it does have a
stickiness to it there's a little bit of
glitter in there I want to say it's like
gold and pink and green iridescent
glitter in there but it just feels
sticky to me slightly sticky liquid
filled with micro-fine glitters and
inspired by mythology mythological
creatures appears white in the vial but
shows up a dazzling shimmery gold when
applied to the skin can be used on bare
skin or overshadows interesting the
glitter in these products is natural
mineral glitter that's approved okay I
approve it as well so that's very
interesting so for six dollars we got
the shadow and this really neat centaurs
wisdom I'm curious to play with this and
see what ends up happening with it it's
it's very interesting I definitely want
to play with it more and see what kinds
of things it can do so overall really
happy with this it is one of those kinds
of descriptions if you don't like
Madonna shadows obviously this isn't
going to be for you but if you do enjoy
mineral as shadows it is really fun and
it isn't it is an expensive compared to
even if CM birchbox which are ten
dollars a month so it is it's fun to get
a little surprising meal and you never
know what your extra is going to be last
month we got a little sample of lip
gloss and that was my first one so
really fun subscription i will put all
