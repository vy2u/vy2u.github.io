of glamour doll eyes otm and i kept
calling it of the moment but it's really
of the month and basically it's a six
dollar a month subscription service
where you get a limited edition glamour
doll eyes eyeshadow for six bucks it's a
little complicated to sign up for it you
have to try to sign up for it at the
time when the window opens i will put as
much information about that down below
also you can go to the glamour doll eyes
website and click otm to find out more
information about that window but it is
a little more complicated because it is
a just a very small company with just
one person i believe putting everything
together so you just kind of have to
take it for what it is it's a small
company so they can only do so much and
they want to give people a different
people an opportunity to try it every
month so basically first come first
serve once it sells out it's done so
they are sending me this as a
promotional subscription but I promise
you I will always be honest with you
whether it's given to me as promotion or
not I am personally a huge fan of
mineral eye shadows I love them I love
working with them some people don't
really like the messiness of them but I
don't mind as long as you top off your
brush it's fine you just have to make
sure you tap off that brush or else you
get all the fallout first thing that I
see in here is the Hydra glazed lip
gloss and this is something that they
sent me on the side because they wanted
me to try it this did not come with the
regular subscription but I did want to
show this to you packaging is really
neat it's got this cool like pop art
kind of picture all of their art is all
this same style and then show you the
pigmentation on that so I've got some
old swatches I shot a bunch of videos
today that is the way that that looks
and it's kind of a cross between a stain
and a gloss smell is a little bit of
vanilla e but it's not strong so if
you're sensitive strong smells this
probably won't bother you it's just a
tad bit sticky just a tad bit i'm going
to put a little bit on my lips right now
just so I can see how it feels of course
I already have a lip product on oh yeah
definitely has a pigmentation to it
feels really good on the lips actually
not sticky once I put it on but I don't
have to have something to do with the
fact that i already had lip product on
on my hand it definitely feel a little
sticky but on my lips I doesn't feel
sticky this one is calm crimson nebula
very creative on the name very
interesting I don't see it as being a
very bright poppy red but this will be
nice for people that don't really
typically wear a lot of red but want to
try a little bit of a subtle red I think
this will be really nice so really enjoy
that that's really neat i'll keep you
updated on that we'll see if it makes it
into a favorites video ok and when you
open up the glamour doll eyes a box the
otm box you get that and they always
send little candies in there and this
month we've got something I've never
seen before it's called heichou and it's
a fruit chew it looks almost like a
Korean candy you guys all know where
this is from somebody will know mo rin
AGA morinaga I don't know cool I have to
look into that but I got two green
apples and a grape meet I will
definitely try those feels a little soft
inside if I try it now I'll be drooling
everywhere because it just seems like
that kind of laffy taffy style I don't
want to do that I can't with a cute
little hair clip that's adorable put
that on cute look at that see I'm
styling right my styling my son just
woke up from his nap play sixties up my
husband is with him and then here we
have a it's called Kauai ka wa I I
Hawaii kawaii maybe it looks like it's
like the same color as the box kind of a
tiffany blue and glamour doll eyes does
not put sifters on their shadows I think
you can request them if you put in an
order but they're otm does not come with
sifters it just can get a little bit
messy if you're not careful gorgeous
pigmentation beautiful matches the bow
pretty nicely what you think are the
little clippie pretty nicely but yeah
this is really pretty I think this will
be really nice as like if I did like a
cream color on my lid and kind of pop
this in the outer corner blend it up
into the crease and then did maybe a
darker color like maybe a brown or like
a taupe or something in the crease to
darken up the crease this would be
really pretty
with that or even on lower lashline this
would be pretty for a little pop of
color and then here it says please enjoy
these sneak peek samples from our spring
collection really cheat releasing march
twenty it's so cool that's nice and they
gave us two little packs they don't
usually do that that's really cool so we
got a pink one and a yellow one and the
pink one is called delilah and then the
yellow ones called old money can I let's
watch so pretty so so pretty oh my
goodness oh my gosh that's gorgeous hmm
so pretty so I think that this actually
this might be a really nice lid color to
go with this one if I put this all over
my lid put this in the outer corner
blend it up into the crease and then use
like a topi Brown to kind of a matte
Toby Brown to kind of balance it out
that actually will be probably really
pretty for spring very cool that was
nice of them thank you and then as
always there's a bunch of little cards
here glamour doll eyes and the chick
that I forget what her name is they told
me she's a YouTube YouTube person though
and then a really nifty neato glamour
doll eyes sticker and as you don't a
lace card and then kauai hawaii power up
I'm gonna hurry up because I want to go
check and see if he's okay my husband's
with them but still I'm gonna go check
on him in just a second kawaii power up
and it's fifteen percent off the kawaii
powerup website kawaii powerup com very
neat phone cases charms jewelry boxes
hair clips this must be from them very
need so very excited about the
subscription it's really fun and it's
one of those less expensive ones so if
you don't want to spend ten dollars if
you just want to get a little surprise
in the mail six dollars is definitely a
good way to go and especially if you
enjoy men or I chefs you don't enjoy
Monroe shows if you don't enjoy if you
don't enjoy colored eye shadows this one
isn't for you but if you do then this
could be one that you may enjoy so again
all the information will be down below
if you enjoyed this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up and makes you

openings and other videos of mine I do
