the new subscription Globe in I am so
excited about this subscription because
I as a small business owner my husband
owns a small business I really really
love supporting small businesses now
this one is unique in that it supports
small businesses all over the world it
helps people in countries where jobs are
not as accessible where health care is
not insured where education is not
insured gives people an ability to use
their skill in order to feed their
families and take care of everything
they need to take care of through their
own personal skills so I am so excited
to show this to you when they contacted
me and asked me to review this I just
got chills and I got so excited to show
this to you so that we can work together
to help people to make their dreams come
true I will put all the information for
globe in including the website and how
much everything costs it down in the
description box below so if you're
interested you can check all of that out
now every single subscription comes in a
box like this and you can see it says
globe and on the side and then it comes
with a pamphlet that tells you all about
the products that you got in your basket
they all come in this really nice
handmade basket the first product is
actually the basket itself this is
called a palm leaf basket it was made in
Mexico and it was made by a woman named
Martina Garcia and she makes all of the
baskets it says at six years old artisan
Martina Garcia learned palm weaving to
help out her aunt now with a family of
her own she has used her gloden earnings
to invest in a small market space where
she can sell her work and create new
products the retail price on one of
these baskets is 12 dollars so let's go
ahead and open it up and see what's
inside the basket and the other thing is
that I get to I get to see all these
things that come from all over the world
and I you know places that I will never
go most likely in my entire life
I get to have products from those places
and it just makes me so happy so the
first thing in here is this Dead Sea
soap and of course I've heard so many
wonderful things about products Dead Sea
products the person who made this she's
right here her name is Cindy
and it says cindyana is dedicated to
improving the status of arab women in
their society by partnering with
Israel's olive farmers by partnering
with Israeli olive farmers and creating
meaningful work for the Palestinian
women the female-led cooperative builds
bridges in a turbulent region and that
says the retail price for this is
eighteen fifty which I do feel like as
kind of over price but I guess if you
figure with the you know with making it
and the process and everything that it
is handmade says it's olive oil dead sea
mud aqua I guess water and sodium
hydroxide produced in the West Bank pact
in Galilee Israel so very very exciting
there and smelling it here it does have
a very earthy scent so if you don't like
earthy sets you may not enjoy this but
it is I mean it's dead sea mud you know
amazing skincare dead sea mud mud
doesn't necessarily smell like anything
but mud so it has to be prepared if you
decide to order one of these it does
kind of smell muddy but a little
refreshing at the same time but muddy
nonetheless alright so I have not tried
it yet because I did want you to be able
to see the bar itself and it also has
this print in here that says head says
her name it says said Jana on there and
it's got a picture of an olive branch
there which is of course the symbol of
peace so very very excited about trying
that ok the next product in here is this
hand-painted candle and this is from
South Africa you get a set of 3 for $29
no bunt Oh meaning for the people is a
cooperative working to alleviate poverty
and now peer South Africa members work
within their community forming each
candle and painting it with locally
inspired - so here is the design that
they've chosen to put on this candle and
I don't know if they're all different
because they're hand-painted I'm
assuming that they are all different to
an extent but you can definitely see the
brushstrokes on here as you look at it I
mean it's just it's absolutely beautiful
it doesn't have any kind of a senate
just smells like wax but it's gorgeous
it's really pretty alright moving on the
next one is shea shampoo from Togo and
that's this one here at shea and honey
nourish and shampoo and citrus blossom
and the smell is not good to me to be
completely honest with you it def
smells very earthy and organic it
doesn't have like a nice citrusy kind of
smell but remember these are all natural
products so that might make a difference
it's also extremely liquidy and watery
so if that would put you off I would
definitely not recommend getting this
one but let me read you the description
it says kept out of the classroom from
an early age Tonga lease women are
commonly illiterate and unemployable
Alphaeus supports inclusive education
initiatives while helping all women earn
fair wages using the traditional shea
butter production skills and then they
have a picture here of the women
churning in their shea butter so because
this is all natural it doesn't have the
same process citrus smell that you may
find at the store also it's extremely
liquidy so keep that in mind if you
ended up deciding to buy this an 8 ounce
bottle is $13 ok so it is handmade
actually in the United States by Alfia
but the ingredients are certified
Fairtrade from cooperatives in Tonga
West Africa so the women don't actually
make the shampoo what they do is they
make the shea butter and then the shea
butter goes to the United States which
is what's included in the shampoos it
says this one specifically for dry or
damaged hair and then next we have this
one's really cool I really like this one
a lot this is a hemp washcloth and it
was made in Bangladesh and you can see
it's hand tied there and it's just it's
just cool it's a hand crocheted hemp
washcloth and right here it says here's
the picture here bag does overall women
artisans depend on their crafting income
to make ends meet the community cleans
and spins raw hemp into yarn which they
used to knit purses bath mats and
washcloths and the price of this is 1715
and I'll just kind of show you what that
looks like oh it's a bag I thought it
was a washcloth but it's a little bag
that's even cuter love that that's just
and it just it smells like hemp it's got
that you know it just smells like it
came from the earth you know like it
just got that nice smell it's very thick
very rough um and it seems very durable
but it's got a little bit of a give to
it just very very off it just makes me
happy I don't know why I get good vibes
off of this is that possible to get good
vibes off of a bag but I just get good
vibes it just seems like it's made with
love you know
exciting to me I don't know I'm just a
SAP for stuff like this and then the
last thing in here is the yerba mate tea
you get three tea bags from the Atlantic
forest of South America and it says a
forgive me if I butcher this GU yaki is
using market driven incentives to
reforge 200,000 acres and create 1,000
jobs by the year 2020 Organic yerba mate
is brewed from the leaves of the South
American holly tree which means shades
and a healthy rainforest to grow it's a
25 count box of tea for seven dollars
and this one it just says it's the
traditional tea there's no flavoring or
anything put into this it's just the
traditional tea so that's very fun as
well so I mean really I do I feel like
this is worth the subscription price I
don't know I think that it just depends
on where you stand as far as supporting
small businesses and other countries I
feel like if you this is something that
you want to do to to support small
businesses in other countries I think
it's definitely worth it but if you're
looking for a high value low cost box
this may not be for you but personally I
think that it's just fun to get things
from other countries and things that are
handmade it's just exciting to me I mean
I just love that this you know that
Martina made this for me like just for
me
she made this and that just makes me so
happy
like I just I don't know anyway I'm just
