would probably be like what hello my
friends welcome to my review of the
January GlossyBox and also showing you
what I got in my februari glossybox in
case you're not familiar with GlossyBox
GlossyBox is a monthly beauty
subscription service sending all kinds
of things beauty for 21 dollars per
month I typically i am not thinking the
glossy boxes worth 21 dollars a month so
we'll show you now whether we think that
they kind of stepped it up in 2016 so
this is the glossy box the box is
beautiful which is probably part of the
cost of your $21 that your tank and it's
got pretty pink tissue paper in here and
it did come with five products this
month the first one was one that I
really like this is the negative 4 17 or
minus 4 17 ocean foot nourishing cream
this was actually very nice I used it on
my daughter and she was like in heaven
and use it on myself and I was at all
this is so nice it's just a very nice
cream now I don't typically talk about
feet on my channel because I don't you
know it's just not a topic i typically
go to but when it comes to fate my feet
have issues well my right foot has
issues i still have a stress fracture
due to walking in high heels for three
days at generation beauty and october
it's a long story but basically a foot
massage is something that I typically
enjoy so I give myself one with this and
I enjoy it the smell is very floral but
it's not so floral that it's grandma e
it's just a very nice floral with a tad
bit of fruit scent and it's just very
nice enjoyable seeps in the skin nicely
but not so fast that you can't get that
good foot rub in there before it seeps
in and it's a very nice product I'm very
thankful that I got to try it through
GlossyBox the next product is one that I
did not try this time because i have
tried this before and it was horrible
for my hair it was horrible this is the
lemon rents it's a gentle clarifying
treatment at least that's what they say
by a brand called beautiful nutrition
this dried out my hair really bad to the
point where I had like straw like down
here was
straight up straw and I use lots of
moisturizers and oils and things like
that on my hair so I do a lot to keep it
hydrated and it just completely stripped
any moisture out of my hair so I did not
use it Gabi's it's such a horrible
experience with this product before so I
will be passing this on but this is the
only thing I did not try this time going
back to another product that i did enjoy
this is the e might or MIT make up for
by artists for artists diamond heart
based primer illuminating one thing i
like about this is that it is kind of a
skin tone flesh tone kind of color comes
out like that goes on like a creamy
formula it is not a silicone II kind of
formula and it leaves a little bit of a
luminescence if you put on a mattifying
foundation it does kind of minimize the
the luminosity of it but i do really
enjoy it if i don't use up a foundation
that's specifically mattifying it leaves
a really nice glow to the skin I
dentally don't recommend using this with
a luminous foundation because I don't go
so a little bit crazy and I have normal
skin so I'm not sure how this would
react to someone with oily skin because
luminosity and wheelies can you kind of
got some natural luminosity going lots I
know if you wouldn't like this but I
personally really enjoyed it you can
still see that there are some glow on my
hand and its pretty much dry at this
point another product that I did not
like was the lip glide by me me me me
and this is called a velvet finished lip
color and look at the shade like I wish
they sent this to me in April instead of
January because this is a very April May
kind of color and I ended up wearing it
around my house one day to check for
where time because it just it's not of
color I like to wear this time of year
um and plus it's very opaque and peach
and it just kind of leaves a weird look
on my lips like I just don't like the
way that it looks it goes on very nicely
the only other complaint i have about it
is it smells like bad lipstick like it
just smells bad it smells cheap and
terrible and transfers to the lips and
it's just making a gag just smelling it
just now just well so that was a big
note for me big big now and then the
last thing in here was the royal apothic
creme creme and it came in a pretty box
like this
and I did use this a few times and I did
enjoy it it's a moisturizing body cream
and I didn't use it all over my body I
did use it on my elbows and I used it on
my mic house the smell is okay I liked
it better the smell better in the tube
than I do on my skin like I don't know
it turns a little plasticky on the skin
but moisturizing is nice let me put it
on my hands just to make sure that I
have a fresh thought in my head about
this it does seep in very nicely but it
does have a very strong sense very
strong scent of flowers like not not
pretty elegant flowers but like I threw
on some perfume that was 40 years old
kind of flowers like not good flowers so
effectiveness yes sent no um and yeah I
wouldn't purchase this but I mean I will
use it probably most likely but I
wouldn't purchase it so overall with the
January box I was very happy to get this
primer that made me really happy I was
really happy to get this foot cream I
don't go out and buy feet cream no very
often so Zach I probably would have
purchased this I would probably purchase
this one these were the nose for me and
these were the yeses for me so $21 let's
put that on on the side now now January
is over let's talk about the februari
box the februari box was gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous and I'm very very
happy about this box I will be reusing
it i'm happy that says glossy box on the
side because that way it's a lot easier
to be reused without a bunch of
advertising on the top and i'm not going
to go into reviews of these things
because i will be going into reviews of
them once i have tested them all out and
once i have received my march box i know
it's already March but you know yep got
backed up here one thing I'm very
anxious to try that I have not tried yet
is the extra Bell golden skin roll on
caviar I gel and this is a very
expensive product this product runs you
$45 for this product that's pretty
pricey so I'm excited to try that I
think this is the most exciting thing
for me in the FEHB you
box things that are not exciting to me
are like this little teeny tiny sample
of the professional are you kidding me
like its I mean even if I got this in
ypsi I would probably be like what this
is this is point 10 ounces three
milliliters come on really all right the
other thing is a face mask I don't
really like face mask I'm very thankful
to have it but again another very low
just low value item in here just not
good this is the Oasis gem lipstick by
T's cosmetics I've not use this on my
lips yet the packaging is super cute the
color is very dark which is not a shade
that I wear all the time but is a shade
I wear for filming so we will probably
wearing that for filming one day scent
is not good sense is bad once again
apparently GlossyBox does not care if
they're lipsticks they put in their
boxes smell bad and then we have glam
glow which is kind of cool I have heard
that ingredients in glam glow we're not
good I don't know anything about that I
will have to research that but this is
the mud to foam something thirsty
cleanse daily hydrating cleanser so I'm
not try any of these things but I will
be back next month to review all of them
for you so hopefully you enjoyed it and
hopefully you will subscribe I will fly
in the subscribe button right there so
that you can hit that subscribe button
so you don't miss the box next month so
i can show you what I got in march and
review all of this stuff for you so if
you're curious don't forget to hit the
button and i want to thank you so much
