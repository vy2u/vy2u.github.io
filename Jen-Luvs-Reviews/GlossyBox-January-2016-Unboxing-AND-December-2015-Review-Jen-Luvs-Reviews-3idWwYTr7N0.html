hello my friends welcome to my glossybox
review of the December box and unboxing
ish of the January box glossybox is
2020-21 dollars a month I am NOT sent
these for review these I paid for out
right I did get a deal on gilt.com one
of those flash sale website so I don't
pay full price for it but no matter what
you guys know that none of that
influences my review at all i'm always
going to give you my honest opinion and
i have opinions for you of these
products so let's go ahead and jump
right in to the december box and what i
thought of things in here so first of
all I just love the box the box is just
so stinkin cute i love it and then it
comes with this here which shows you all
the products which i love gives
descriptions gives you prices all of
that so let me tell you let's start off
with this product because i am ashamed
that i didn't actually use this yet I
feel really really bad I got a julep
mystery box that had a bunch of really
cool colors in it I got a julep
subscription box and I love my job and I
honestly forgot about this overall I
have enjoyed color club nail polishes
overall I'm going to bring this back in
the January review februari unboxing
video and give you more opinion on this
I don't want to lie and pretend like I
use this when I really truly didn't so
we're just gonna have to bring it back
and I'm just gonna have to apologize
profusely this is in the shade feverish
it is a deep burgundy red and I have 50
million shades like this so it just
doesn't call to me this is the color
flex home care leave in treatment and
detangler with color strength technology
now because i only use this maybe four
or five times I can't really speak to
the color strength technology of it I
can't say is a very nice leave-in
conditioner I'm gonna smell it cuz i
forgot what smells like doesn't really
have much of a sense it has kind of a
like a soap be kind of set with a fresh
clean soapy kind of scent it supposed to
help your hair color stay in longer and
i haven't used it enough to be able to
speak to that the problem with this
and me is that I have very thin hair so
i don't need detangling of my hair so i
really need to just put this on my kid
and see if it detangles her hair because
she's got like nice thick hair like the
way mine was when i was seven so i need
to use this on her as far as a leave-in
treatment I mean my hair feels nice
after I use it but it just hasn't done
anything magical for me and I really
don't blame the product I think it's
just my hair and only using it four or
five times this product here this is the
Oro gold cosmetics hand cream I did read
a little bit more about this and some of
the people in the comments told me that
there is some kind of gold in this it
just says the ultimate hand cream for
all skin types combining essential
vitamins and oils non-greasy blah blah
blah so I was using this and really
enjoying it until today today is the
coldest day that we have had this season
and I put it on my hands and my hands
started burning so badly that I like I
had to wash it off because it hurt so
bad because my hands were so incredibly
dry because of the season so if you have
incredibly dry skin you probably don't
want to use this if you just have normal
to dry skin you may like this or if you
have oily skin you may like this but
your hands are really dry it stings like
a expletive deleted another product it
was not a standout product to me with
the mtj high definition mascara it was
just an ordinary mascara I have
drugstore mascaras that are that I feel
like perform better than this I'll show
you the wand here it is a very strange
bubbly looking wand don't feel like the
Wan did anything magical for me um and I
don't know I wasn't particularly what it
wasn't particularly dry it wasn't really
lengthening it wasn't pretty early
volumizing it wasn't bad it just didn't
make me go yes that's a good mascara you
know what I mean it was just very
mediocre I wish I had better things to
say I just don't but what I do have good
things to say about is this eyeshadow
here this is a glossy box I shadow in
the shade glossy mob and it says dobner
cosmetics for GlossyBox and I am really
excited about this eyeshadow it is so
creamy and the lasting power is
wonderful it's just a really nice shade
I've used this up
crees quite a few times I hope glossybox
continues to make more products I am
relatively new to GlossyBox I don't know
if this is their first makeup product
but I really enjoyed this a lot I think
it's a wonderful i shadow overall with
this I mean I feel like it was just a
very mad kind of box I mean I pay about
850 for this box I definitely think was
worth well more than 850 I don't think
it's worth twenty dollars that's that's
kind of the way I'm feeling right now
about the December box let's go ahead
and move into the January Bob so for
January we didn't get any kind of fancy
shmancy box but I saw that februari we
are getting a fancy shmancy box so I'm
excited about that I tried a few things
in here but not everything the thing
that I've tried the most is this Emmett
or a mite makeup by artists for artists
diamond heart based primer illuminating
if you saw my last what's up in makeup
episode I was wearing this and that was
I think what was responsible for my
glowy finish this really does leave a
luminous glow to the skin if you do wear
a mattifying foundation over top it will
cancel out a lot of a luminosity but if
you wear a regular foundation or a
luminous foundation you will have that
luminous look with this it's just a very
low SHINee kind of primer it's very nice
it comes off that pink shade peachy
shade but it doesn't stay like that it
ends up just kind of blending out so
that you can't see it at all but it does
leave a nice luminosity and I'm really
happy with us so far all right this next
product I haven't tried this time but I
have tried it before this is the
beautiful nutrition lemon rinse it says
it's a gentle clarifying treatment
distant horrible things to my hair when
i use it before i will not be putting
this back on my hair it's ride on my
ends so bad like from here down it was a
frizzy straw mess and i use a lot of
leavin conditioners and conditioning
masks and stuff on my hair because it is
color treated so it dries out pretty
easily so i will be passing this along
to someone with oil your hair than me
it's just it was really bad on my hair
so I'm definitely gonna be passing this
long I'm not opening this I'm just not
even messing with that
and one thing that I did try that I
don't have here with me because I seem
to have misplaced it somewhere my kid
probably took it is probably what
happened because she loved it it's the
714 foot nourishing cream it says winter
is the most unfavorable season for dry
cracked souls and it says it's got Dead
Sea and aloe vera leaf juice and all
that kind of stuff so she loved this I
gave her a little baby foot massage my
little seven-year-old and she was like
in heaven it smells very low SHINee it
feels really good on the skin and I'm
enjoying this so far I but I just
misplaced it I don't know where it is so
hopefully I find it before the the
January review and the februari unbox
this I have not tried yet because it's a
very spring-like color and I just can't
bring myself to use it this is the me me
me lip glide it's a velvet finish lip
color and I will show you what that
swatch is like it's just like bright
April you know what's like it's like May
flowers and and it's supposed to be like
a blizzard this weekend I can't bring
myself to put this on my lips I'm sure I
will even if it's just wearing it around
the house on a snow day or something to
test it but it's like this is just not a
shade I would wear and that's just me
like I know there's no real rules and
makeup but for me this is not a shade I
feel comfortable wearing in the
wintertime I'm more of like a maulvi
kind of person in wintertime this looks
better on like my when I my skin gets a
little self tan and everything but I
mean it seems very creamy and it seems
very nice doesn't really have a set to
it which is really good maybe a tad bit
of a lipstick he sent but not bad so I'm
gonna have to try this at some points
but I wish they had to send such a
springy color and then the last thing in
here is royal apothic cream cream cream
creme creme creme creme creme it's a
moisturizing body cream supposedly it
exfoliates as well you're supposed to
put it on after the shower and I have
not even open this yet let me see ya oh
I did I must have opened it I don't
remember it smells lotioning but I'm
gonna have to use it for its intended
poop yeah I feel like as a little bit
better than the December box so far
maybe I don't know though I mean like I
mean the primer is really nice but I'm
gonna have to try this but I have to try
this the foot cream is awesome and this
is horrible for me so I don't know we're
still on the fence with the January box
we're gonna have to try things a little
more before we do a full review so I
