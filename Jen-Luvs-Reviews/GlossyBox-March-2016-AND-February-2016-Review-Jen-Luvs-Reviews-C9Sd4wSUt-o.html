subscription box for a baby doll then
maybe this would be a good little
product hello my friends welcome to my
review of the februari glossybox that
apparently has a tail and letting you
know what I got in my march GlossyBox
video in case you've never been to one
of my subscription box videos this is
how it rolls we go ahead and review the
products that were in the previous
month's box and then I show you what was
in the current month's box typically
people just show the current month but I
feel like doing the reviews of the
previous month really truly gives you a
value of what the subscription box is
all about and also if you're not a
glossybox subscriber it'll let you know
whether maybe you want to go out on the
purchase these products individually so
we're go ahead and jump into the
februari review but before we do I want
to let you know that I do pay for this
box out right it is not sensitive for
review i'm not affiliated with GlossyBox
in any way other than the same way that
anybody that subscribes is affiliated in
that we all get links that give us
points i think it's called glossy dots
something or another and that link is
down below but that's the same thing at
any GlossyBox subscriber gets its no
special perks so let's talk about the
februari box now this februari box let
me tell you the best thing about this
debris box with the actual box and
that's that's not a good thing
considering this is a $21 subscription
this box is gorgeous I will definitely
be repurposing the spots it is so so
pretty it says love is in the air on the
side it says GlossyBox instead of all
over the front which I really really
like because then that way I don't feel
like it's like a glossy box
advertisement as I'm using this for
something else but I just think it's
really really pretty now the products
that are in here mm let's start off with
the lipstick that I'm wearing this is
the I'm going to read it off the card
one that I do like about glossybox they
include all the information on the card
this is the t's cosmetics Oasis gem
lipstick in heat wave Ruby it is on my
lips right now I wore it one other time
other than this okay so gorgeous opaque
color if you like the shade the shade is
a little vampy for me
it's a little deep it's a little crazy
for me but I'm dealing with it the
formula is very gritty and I've never
felt a gritty lip product before it's
actually got grit in it which is weird I
don't feel in my lips once a once it's
applied but as I'm applying it it just
feels a little scratchy which is very
strange the other thing is is it
definitely bleeds it's not transfer
proof at all and when it transfers it
like transfers and makes a mess
everywhere because I think it's supposed
to be a long-wearing lipstick so when it
transfers it's like stuck on your skin
where or wherever you're transferring it
to it's like stuck there so don't kiss
anybody with this on I'm just telling
you because they're not getting it off
it just isn't going to happen I'm gonna
put this away before I make a bigger
mess but not happy with this at all this
is a $22 value if i can get a two-faced
lipstick i am not buying this oh no the
other thing is in the tube it does smell
really bad that smell did not transfer
in my lip so it doesn't bother me that
much but if you're sensitive to smells
you may not like that either total total
fail on that lip product not happy with
at all next one was a sheet mask now I
tell you I am bias against sheet masks I
do not like them i don't like that how
they feel but I do try them in case I
see some kind of magical amazing results
did not see any magical amazing results
from this this is the bio Republic a low
rescue revitalizing fiber mask it was
just the mask it felt slimy I don't like
them so but I didn't see any amazing
results so I wanted to test it just to
make sure the other thing I didn't see
any results from was the eye cream this
is the extra Bell golden skin roll on
caviar I gel and I did have to get this
going the ball was not moving so i had
to pry up the plastic and kind of force
the ball to move and when I did that I
noticed that inside is not a liquid but
a cream product so as I've used this
more because i did use this for about
two weeks I noticed that the product
does not come out anymore and you
actually have to cap the product shake
the cream down and then use it so I
would imagine as you use this closer to
the end you're going to end up wasting a
lot of product down to the bottom and
for such an expensive product that is
just not cool to me it is beautiful
packaging but I don't think it's very
efficient packaging as far as getting
the product out unless you have
one of those little beauty scraper
things as little plastic spatula things
for beauty products but this was a no
for me as well unfortunately this is one
I had high hopes for this is the glam
glow thirsty cleanse daily hydrating
cleanser the smell of this is so good it
smells like like if you were going to
have some kind of berry flavored cupcake
frosting that's what the smells like it
smells stinkin amazing and I first put
on my face I was like oh my gosh I'm in
heaven this is an amazing product this
is supposed to be a hydrating cleanser
and actually dried out my face and I
have normal skin it is rare that i feel
like a cleanser dries out my face and i
was very very careful to make sure to
follow the directions exactly to it see
the way that it says to use it so i try
not to leave it on for a long period of
time i used it multiple times i tried
getting off my face as quickly as
possible to see if that made any
difference it did not it still dried out
my skin so this is a no for me
unfortunately and then the last product
in here get ready for it look how tiny
it is it's a little bitty baby and if we
were going to have a subscription box
for a baby doll then maybe this would be
a good little product these are the
samples you get for free at Ulta or
sephora this is not a subscription box
size for $21 maybe you'd be pushing it
for MCM Birchbox but not for a $21
subscription I was like look to this I
was like you have got to be kidding me
this better be an extra oh no it's not
an extra it is a very good product
though I have to say that though it is a
good product I love the professional I
feel like it works really well on my
skin I don't have big pores but it
definitely helps my makeup stay on
longer I love the way it feels it's got
kind of a silicone II kind of feel and
it feels great it works great but the
size of it just made me angry it's like
really really glossy box so I was very
disappointed in that so there wasn't a
single product in this GlossyBox that
made me happy for $21 usually there's at
least one this one not any of them we
got the messy lipstick we got the drying
cleanser we got the slimy facemask we
got the ant effective I gel
and we got the baby american girl doll
size professional this was a big note
for this box huge know and I'm being
honest I'm not trying to be rude I'm
just trying to make sure GlossyBox knows
if they watch this that they need to
make some improvements in what they put
in their box now you know if glossybox
happened to watch my videos maybe they
might have listened because wait till
you see we got in our March box oh wow
okay lawsy box shouldn't step it up a
notch oh wow some great stuff in March I
cannot wait to show you i am not going
to give full reviews on these products
that will be coming next month so make
sure you subscribe so you don't miss
that but GlossyBox did a great job let
me show you so the first thing I looked
at I was like what is this teeny tiny
little sample again are you kidding me
this is the sign veera reservatrol we're
low moisture day cream the full size of
this a 1.83 fluid ounce is one hundred
forty six dollars and I was like really
this teeny tiny little thing how am I
even supposed to know whether it works
with his teeny tiny little tiny baby
sample like what what and then I looked
inside the box and saw oh he included
two of them yeah GlossyBox I was like
good job on you GlossyBox thinking ahead
look at chill good job putting two of
him in there that was smart nice job
next thing I saw in here I was like up a
philosophy rip off because I'm all jaded
against glossy box at this point a
philosophy ripoff we have I love
raspberry and blackberry mmm okay let's
give it smells like plastic and I went
like this in a way oh lordy this smells
so good oh it smells so good it smells
amazing it smells like fresh raspberries
it smells so incredible and the
moisturization of this I know it's not
supposed to be reviewing this but it
gives me chills it feels so good and it
smells so good I want to use this all
the time
every day it is feels so good and I'm
hoping that it stays that way I know I'm
not supposed to be reviewing things but
I cannot stop about this it smells so
good I like this better than any
philosophy product I have ever tried I'm
telling you I am so impressed with us so
I'm gonna stop reviewing and i'm gonna
show you what else was in here and now
it was like oh eyeliner I bet it's it's
a liquid eyeliner I bet it's not even
opaque I bet it's not even good oh it's
Aiko oh I like Ike oh I it's the I do
liquid eyeliner it says that's where I
draw the line this is I can't get open
because my hands are all Gracie from the
lotion but it is a marker tip eyeliner
it's very very black I'm excited to use
this more this model next up I saw one
of my favorite brush brands Luxy beauty
I love luck see Beauty brushes this is a
large angle brush I already own this
it's amazing it is going to be in a
future giveaway video make sure you stay
tuned for that and then the last thing
in here is something I've wanted for so
long this is melted chihuahua by to face
the melted lipstick I've always wanted
melted Chihuahua this is my color I own
melted peony I owed some of the
chocolate ones i do not own this one and
i cannot wait to use it i am super
