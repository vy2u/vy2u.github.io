hello my friends welcome to my very
first glossybox unboxing I want to thank
two very special friends of mine sherry
price and agyeman sent for convincing me
to do more box openings in this format I
think this is the way that it's going to
work best for me so that I don't
procrastinate on filming box opening say
know how much people love the
subscription boxes so I'm gonna go go
ahead and unbox this for you even though
I've already looked inside but I haven't
swatched a bunch of stuff I haven't
really delved into it I want to show you
what I got and then after I show you
what I got I'm going to next month give
you a review of the products that were
in this box along with an unboxing of
the current month so thank you to sherry
and Aggie for giving me that suggestion
that's the way I'm going to do things
hopefully y'all like this format and
since this is the very first one that
I've ever gotten we're gonna start here
with just the unboxing so GlossyBox I
got on a deal thanks to nicole at yay or
nay nicole if you're not following her
she puts a lot of deals up on her
YouTube channel definitely check her out
i will link her channel down below if
she found a deal on gilt city calm where
you could get a year's worth of glossy
bucks for only 850 a box so that's what
I chose to do so this is not set to me
for review or anything this is something
i purchased outright on a sale and you
know GlossyBox doesn't know that I'm
making this we're not affiliated in any
way it's just a you know a review of the
box so let's go ahead and cut out
everything else and let's go ahead and
start telling you what is in this glossy
barks lolly barks is 21 dollars per
month and one of the things that you pay
for for your 21 dollars a month is this
beautiful box this box is gorgeous it is
like really high quality like craziness
like it's gorgeous and then it's got
this beautiful little tie here and it's
got a little slaw cbox little sticker
there and then this beautiful little
card that's got all the products on it
again this is 21 dollars a month so I
kind of compare this to boxy charm as
far as what I'm expecting in value this
is where it gets a little sticky this is
the flora p floral therapy
facial sheet in blackberry primrose now
i am not a fan of face mask I think that
they feel gross they feel cold they're
not relaxing they're not spa-like to me
I do not enjoy face mask I know a lot of
people love them I just cannot it just
grosses me out but I'm going to do it so
that I can review it for you next
month's makes you subscribe so you don't
miss the next up in here we got this
this is about a quarter of a full-size
lotion by crabtree &amp;amp; evelyn and this is
the low source ultra moisturizing hand
therapy and i have not opened this yet
and i want to try this my hands are
feeling a bit parched starting to get a
little dry in the Maryland area it
smells like flowers very mature flowers
it's not my favorite scent it's not a
bad set but it's not something that I
feel fits in my age like my grandma
would rock this totally rock this and
she's an amazing lady so I might pass
this on to my grandma I think she'll
like this yes one thing I do like that I
see in here is that the number one
ingredient is water the second
ingredient is macadamia seed oil which i
think is super cool it seems like it's a
very nice product but i'm not a fan of
the smell it did seep into my hands very
nicely my hands don't feel oily at all
but i think i'm gonna pass this on my
grandma i'll use it a little bit more
and then grandmas getting it we have the
little baby estee lauder revitalizing
supreme global anti-aging cream now we
know that these creams are stupid
expensive stupid expensive the full size
of this is like 50 bucks but dude this
is the tiniest little sample like this
reminds me of the samples i'm sure that
they give these like as like a gift with
purchase kind of sample there's hardly
anything in here like i just feel like
for $21 I should be getting something a
little bit bigger I don't know are you
with me on that the retail price for
this full-size is fifty dollars a retail
price of this mini is 850 I am NOT tried
this yet I am going to try it I'll let
you know in the next video next product
and here is a maersk mineral eyeshadow
no I have received a maersk mineral
eyeshadow before the one that i have for
it is in vanilla frosting it's a very
very nice eyeshadow so I expect that
this one would be nice as well this one
is in the shade you're toast and i'll go
ahead and swatch that for you i haven't
opened it yet but it looks absolutely
gorgeous okay here's a swatch of the
mineral eyeshadow i mean absolutely a
gorgeous gorgeous color that's going to
be really fun to play with really loving
that shade loving how the product card
says that the afull size is twenty-four
dollars four point four seven ounces
that is gigantic for an eyeshadow this
one here is point zero four ounces and
this cargo blush is 0 point three seven
ounces so this eyeshadow would be point
10 ounces bigger than this for an
eyeshadow so I think that might be a
misprint just had to check I just looked
on the maersk website and it says that
Moore's men are eyeshadows are 1.2 grams
one hundred percent natural mineral
based loose powder that is strictly
cruelty free and available in a range of
striking shades ba ba ba ba ok this is
1.2 grams so they're saying that this is
the full size and that the price for
this is 2250 maybe because it's imported
I it better be the most amazing
eyeshadow i have ever seen for 20 to 50
for this much eyeshadow all right moving
on to the last product in MA golosa box
I got the define Universal lip pencil it
says the only lip pencil you'll ever
need and it is by beauty for really used
lip pencils it's not really my thing i
mostly wear natural lip colors so i
don't have to worry about you know
bleeding outside the lines and things
like that I feel like lip liners are
really good for people that are wearing
really bright colors I mean it is
gorgeous it seems to go on very very
nicely and maybe I'll experiment with it
but I'm not really super excited about
it you
I'm saying so you know just a personal
preference thing I'm not super excited
about it but we will try it and we'll
see what happens so overall my first
experience with GlossyBox has not been
I'm not impressed like at all like I'm
seeing why they were selling it for 850
a box I don't know if this is typical
this is the way I'm feeling it's 21
dollars a month so I should feel twice
as awesome about this as I do with it
Birchbox or with an tipsy and I just
don't I've got a quarter of a size of
hand lotion I've got a ridiculously
overpriced I shadow I've got a lip liner
and I've got a deluxe little sample that
probably is a gift with purchase of an
essay Lauder eye cream and face mask
like that's not exciting to me there's
nothing in here that makes me go yes I
mean the closest thing I guess is the
eyeshadow because it's just really
beautiful and I can't wait to try this
so i guess i can say yes i'm very
excited about the eyeshadow but nothing
else in here excites me if I saw that
saw this on a shelf for $21 there's no
way in the world I would buy it there's
no way if I saw this on a shelf for
twelve dollars I would buy it but no
more than 12 maybe 14 but that would be
pushing it I'm not gonna give a Jets
personal value until I actually try
these products because like I want to
see what if this eye cream is amazing I
don't know maybe it's worth 850 we're
gonna find out next month so make sure
you subscribe so you don't miss the
glossy box unboxing for next month
hopefully they'll be one every month
that's the goal I don't ever guarantee
anything cuz you never know what's gonna
happen but that's my goal I hope you
enjoyed this unboxing and bad luck to
you my friend I'll see you next video
two
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
