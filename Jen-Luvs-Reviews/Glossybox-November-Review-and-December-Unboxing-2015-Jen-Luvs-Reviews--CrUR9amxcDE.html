hello my friends welcome to my November
glossybox review and my December
GlossyBox unboxing this is the first
time that I have been able to do this
type of video I hope you enjoy it
definitely leave your feedback down
below on this format now just so you
know this box is not sent to me for
promotion i did pay for this outright
with a coupon from gilt city com but I
got it outright GlossyBox is not
affiliated with me in any way they from
what I know they don't even know I make
these videos so as always however you
can expect an honest review on my
channel disclaimer / let's get into what
I thought of the November GlossyBox now
that I've tried every product in the box
now you may notice that my makeup is not
looking amazing today and it's because i
purposely did not touch up my makeup
because i wanted you to be able to see
the mascara that came out of my december
box but we'll get to that in a minute
let's go into the november first thing
that I tried was by flora p and it is a
floral therapy facial sheet mask this is
a deep hydration mask in blackberry
primrose infused with Primrose
aromatherapy and if you know me you know
that I do not like sheet masks I think
they feel disgusting they're not
pleasant they're cold they're wet
they're slimy it is not fun for me it's
a tactile thing for me I get why people
like them but it's not my thing but I
sucked it up and I did this and I sent a
picture to my friend Lily Spurgeon here
on YouTube and I look like what I'm
doing just like oh my gosh I can't
believe you're doing a sheet mask like
yeah I know I'm doing it for the channel
you know I got to find out what this
thing is like but let me tell you this I
did not like the experience if you hear
a little jealous cuz my dogs at my feet
um I did not like the experience of
using this but after it was done you can
leave the serum on your face as like an
evening serum and I really do feel like
it really made my skin feel very very
nice and when I woke up in the morning I
felt like my skin had a very nice
texture like an unusually nice texture
my skin is not problem skin but I did
really like the way my skin felt in the
morning i have to admit so if i were to
you
sheet masks I would have really liked
this if it wasn't for that old decked
outfit yes that was a thumbs up for me
and I can't believe I just said alright
moving on to the crabtree &amp;amp; evelyn
lasource ultra moisturizing hand therapy
is a deep hydration lotion my problem
with this is I do not enjoy the smell
the scent is very I called it a very
mature sense this is going to be passed
along to my grandma she does celebrate
Hanukkah Hanukkah is over but I didn't
get a chance give this to her for
Hanukkah so I will be passing this along
to her when we celebrate Christmas with
my other part of my family it's very it
doesn't feel oily but I can still feel
that slickness on my hands it doesn't
seep in completely but it is a very very
nice lotion it's just the scent is not
my style you know I'm saying alright the
next thing was this beauty for real lip
liner and this is supposedly the only
lip liner you will ever need I am
wearing that on my lips today I did put
this on right before filming it is a
nice lip liner I am NOT a big lip liner
person so I haven't used it many times I
think I used it once before this and I
didn't really notice anything
spectacular about it but it is a very
nice color it goes on very easily it is
very creamy to swatch it is very creamy
to put on the lips and it's an enjoyable
lip liner is it the only lip liner I'll
ever need maybe because I don't really
use lip liners and if I were to use only
one lip liner I could see myself only
using this one so not bad we'll take
that estee lauder revitalizing supreme
globba globba anti-aging cream and my
dogs active today he's just shaking all
over the place I used this all the way
up this was a very enjoyable product to
use seeped into the skin very very
nicely I did use this religiously every
day and night until it was completely
gone which took about a little over two
weeks to use this little tiny pot I was
using it sparingly I used it all over my
face and tried not to use more than I
absolutely needed because I wanted to
stretch it out as long as I could I
didn't notice any effects I mean I've
got these crazy wrinkles here I've got
someone fine lines under my eyes and
didn't see any effects with it but it
was a
enjoyable to use if you want something
that's just a nice moisturizer I would
recommend it but don't expect anything
more Acula sappenin you know I'm Sam all
right and then the last thing in here
was actually my absolute favorite thing
in this box totally shocked me maersk I
shadows I have one other one that I
really really like but this one
definitely is my favorite maersk I said
it's probably one of my favorite mineral
eye shadows of all time and this one is
called your toast let me swatch this for
you it is so stinkin gorgeous if you can
get past the fact that it's a mineral
eyeshadow and is kind of messy
girlfriend you are going to love this
eyeshadow i do I can see why somebody
would pay $22 for this I'm not kidding
like I can see it good that and that's
the way it transfers to the eye as well
just like that is stinking gorgeous and
I put this on I was on periscope and I
put this on and we all wet oh so pretty
oh my goodness it's beautiful it's
absolutely beautiful I probably wouldn't
stock up on a ton of these just because
they're so pricey but this is a really
nice oh I have to admit it I have to
admit it so overall when you talk about
a value of the box cuz now i can speak
to my personal value for the box maersk
I shadow I'm gonna put it at a price of
$15 for this eyeshadow I feel like $22 a
little overpriced for any eyeshadow
especially a mineral eyeshadow I don't
know and then the essay Lauder cream i
would put this at maybe six dollars for
this sample size I know that it's worth
more than that but it just didn't have
any amazing effect so I wouldn't put a
bit more than that the flora p mask I
would put it about five dollars i would
definitely pay that for this the lip
liner I would put about eight or nine
dollars it is a very very nice lip liner
and then the hand lotion I put in about
three dollars so i do feel like this is
worth the subscription price of $21 it's
not worth a ton more than that but i did
enjoy it it ended up being a very good
GlossyBox i wasn't sure what i unboxed
and I was a little skeptical about it
but it ended up being good GlossyBox so
now we're gonna go ahead and move
into the December box and look how
gorgeous this boxes I open it and I went
woohoo look how pretty this is really
really happy with this box I don't know
what I'm going to do with it maybe keep
ornaments or something in it for the
holidays I think would be great one
thing i like about glossy boxes they
include a card with tons of information
which makes me really happy to see with
things like if see you don't get any
information and it really really stinks
to get no information it doesn't have to
be this crazy but give us something you
know i'm saying but this is very nice
alright so so far i've only used two of
these products there will be a full
review on this box next month when i
unbox my january box the first thing i
want to talk about is the reason why i
have my makeup like this is the mtj high
definition mascara i've used this twice
now and i just want to do a close-up on
my eyes so i'm not sure if you can see
but i have a bunch of flaking going on
down here which made me very unhappy the
lasting power of it was pretty good let
me see if you can see the length of my
lashes now before mascara I have like no
lashes like no lashes so as I applied
this it definitely has more lengthening
than volumizing it separates lashes very
very nicely and I feel like a lot of
that is due to this crazy brush this one
has these little crazy bumpy's in it and
it's very very nice if the bumpy's I
feel like don't really probably don't do
a whole lot but the bristles I feel like
really separate my lashes very very
nicely so if you can stand the flakiness
then you might like this musty ride the
other thing is it definitely transferred
to my lower lashes so somebody with
watery eyes this may run on you just
because I can tell with the transfer
usually that's a sign that it will run
on some people it didn't run on me it
just flaked on me um but you know so man
on this mascara there's definitely some
really awesome drugstore mascaras that
will outperform this and the retail
price on that mascara is $21 so far not
feeling $21 next up is the color club
nail polish
this is a gorgeous winter color it's
that public oxblood kind of color the
shade is called feverish i'm going to go
I'd get my swatch we don't watch this
for you okay so i just watched these on
my swatch wheel okay this is one coat
this is two coats if it might even be
able to stand a third coat but it's
definitely not going to get you in one
coat two coats might be passable if
their thick coats three coats will
probably be the best for this it's not
as ox bloody as I thought it was going
to be this swatch came out almost
purpley and then this one isn't like a
burgundy purpley kind of color
definitely doesn't look the same as it
does in the bottle okay I don't know it
just doesn't seem like it looks the same
maybe it looks the same on camera but in
person this nail polish looks a lot
darker in the bottle than it does in the
swatch but maybe the third coat would
make a difference so I don't know should
we try a third coat let's try a third
coat hey the third coat definitely
darkened it one thing I appreciate about
this polish is how glossy it is it's
extremely glossy so that's three coats
there that's one coat that's three coats
so you can really get that oxblood kind
of color coming to it when you put the
three coats on I asked me once where I
got my swatch wheels I got my swatch
wheels at sally beauty supply you can
get them on amazon for like super cheap
you can get packs of them for like four
or five bucks for like a giant pack of
them they're really really cheap for
swatch wheels in case you or one so of
course I can't speak to wear time this
because I haven't tried it yet but I
will put it on my nails between now and
the January video and give you some idea
of where time on this so we shall see
all right next up we got this orrow gold
cosmetics hand cream and they did send a
hand cream the month before so it's kind
of like a hand cream and a hand cream is
this the way this is going to be this is
one of my second box ever so this one
smells a little better this one still
has that hand cream typical like cold
cream almonds kind of scent to it I
already have the other lotion on but
we'll try it a little bit anyway get a
first impression on it it's definitely
seeping in better than the crabtree &amp;amp;
evelyn one the scent is better but it's
not like all better
as far as the enjoy ability of the scent
for me it just says that it has shea
butter in it it doesn't say that there's
anything crazy in this like I was
thinking about it says it's a 24 karat
hand cream but it doesn't say anything
about I don't know why it's called that
it's kind of odd to make gold be so
prominent and the only thing gold on it
is the packaging kind of weird I don't
know but it says it just has a lot of
shea butter and it's instantly soften
and keep hands in tip-top shape so you
will definitely try this out they do
recommend they say when your hands need
it most combine this cream with cotton
gloves before bed wake up with smooth
hydrated skin I don't know when we
taking it that far girlfriends my hands
will be sweating all night and I cannot
handle that but i will try this more
before january the next thing in here is
the color flex or ph lex i believe its
flex home care leave in treatment and
detangler with color strengthening
technology and i'm all about some
leave-in conditioner so i'm very excited
to try this as far as the sense it's not
shaking so that leads me to believe
there's like oh it's more of a creamy
thick formula in here which I've had
come out as sprays before let me see it
yeah it's there it's very thick inside
but it comes out as a spray I don't
really get how that works but it does
the scent is not offensive it doesn't
have a great sense but it's not like a
very strong chemically kind of scent
it's more like a little bit of a fresh
floral II kind of smell to it so I'm
very anxious to try this and then the
last thing in here is the eyeshadow in
glossy mob and this is by dobner
cosmetic for GlossyBox so this is glossy
boxes actual eye shadow and I have not
tried this on my eyes yet I have
swatched it and it looks gorgeous it
looks it feels very soft very pigmented
and on the on the hand on me on the
finger but then when you swatch it it
definitely isn't as pigmented as I would
expect that's not necessarily a bad
thing because it might just be really
blend bull it's not patchy at all and
it's not dry so I'm really curious to
play with this it's got a really nice
color on that nice topi
troll kind of shade and I'm really
looking forward to playing with this
before the January review I feel like at
first glance this is definitely worth
the $22 but I'm definitely not going to
say that it is yet this mascara I can
tell you is definitely not worth the
price but other than that I don't really
know yet i'll have to let you know you
