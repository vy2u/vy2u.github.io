before you watch this video you're
really kind of think I'm weird after
because this box is not makeup related
you're getting this as a bonus video I
upload my review videos on Tuesdays and
Thursdays so this is extra along with
the other content for this week I didn't
want this to replace a beauty video for
you so you may know this about me you
may not but I love rocks I know it's
weird I love anything that's really
really really old I love dinosaurs and
history and castles and rocks so I
started getting into collecting stones
probably maybe 7 or 8 years ago
something like that just collecting
different stones I was very curious
about the stones and of course when you
when you google search stones you're
gonna find all of the metaphysical
properties of stones the different
energies that people claim that
different stones have so I started kind
of dabbling a little bit in that when I
used to teach I kept a giant piece of
citrine on my desk I used to put citrine
in my pockets when I write had a big
speech or sometime that I needed to talk
I always had some kind of blue stone in
my pockets I would you know little
things like that if I was feeling
particularly hurt that day or I felt
like I was just in a bad place
emotionally I would carry green stones
because that's for your love shot your
heart chakra not love chakra your heart
chakra things like that and again I
don't know if this stuff's placebo it
totally could be but I sometimes I feel
like the human mind is so powerful and
that if you just believe in something
enough that you can create physical
changes within your body just by
believing in something I mean for
example if I have the hiccups all I have
to do is tell myself I don't have the
hiccups I'm not gonna hiccup I'm not
gonna hiccup and I can make my hiccups
stop things like that if you think about
the emotional reaction that you have and
the physical changes in your body when
you are under stress or when you're in
love I mean there's when you when you
when your mind can control your body in
certain ways and I think that that is
part of why stones work for me so for
exam
well this doesn't have to do with
goddess provisions which is the
subscription box somebody talking about
but I did want to show you my selenite
wand this I'm telling you if you believe
in this at all I believe this really
helps me whether again whether it's
placebo or not is my selenite wands and
whenever I'm feeling like I have a lot
of negative bad energy within me I lay
down and I just run I can feel it
already I know this is weird I know I'm
weird I take my cell and I want and I
just kind of go like this down my body
and I just imagine all the negative
energy being sucked into the selenite
wand and for whatever reason it makes me
feel better whether it's just all in my
mind or whether it actually really is
doing some good it works for me and I am
a firm believer and doing what makes you
happy as long as you're not hurting
anyone else and this kind of stuff makes
me happy so when God has provisions
contacted me and asked me if I would
review their box first of all I love
supporting small businesses second I
think this stuff is really cool and if
you think it's really cool too then
maybe you'll be curious what's in this
box and hopefully you'll enjoy this
video so goddess provisions is $33 a
month I've got my notes down here it's
$99 for three months or you can get six
months 478 dollars or you can get 333
dollars for an entire year it is a
hundred percent vegan and cruelty free
you can cancel or pause at any time if
you subscribe by February 17th you will
get this exact box so let's go ahead and
jump into what is in here and then you
can decide for yourself whether this is
worth thirty three dollars to you or not
first thing in here is fairy magic it is
a candle so when you open it up you can
see there are some stones in here
there's a rose and some other little
flower seeds and things it's very very
cute it smells very floral very bright
floral I don't know how else to describe
it it's really really smells nice if you
like a strong a floral scent I
personally prefer fruity scents but I
understand why there's floral in here
the next thing in here is the fairy
garden mineral bath they're just bath
salts fragrant blossoms soothing herbs
aromatic flowers and mineral rich salts
create a magical bathing experience
perfect for cleansing or as a ritual
bath
it's got a similar scent to the candle
and when you pour it out hopefully you
can see hook like you can zoom in and
see there's little pieces of flour in
there which are beautiful very very nice
I'm gonna see if I can scoop it back in
here I'm not a big bath person so
because I just touched that and poured
that back in I will pass this along to a
friend that is a bath person next this
is fun this is the Pacifica rainbow
crystals liquid mineral strobe and
you're supposed to use it as a
highlighter by the way the eye look that
I have won today is from the box of
crayons I have that review coming up
really really soon I believe next
Tuesday is when that review is going to
go alive so let's go ahead and I'm just
gonna put a little bit on my hopefully
my collarbone where is my collarbone
somewhere over there whoa look at that
whoa it's got glitter as glittery
holy moly up I feel like a fairy already
glowing I'm glowing oh it smells like
vanilla it smells really good
it smells like like cake vanilla cake I
don't know if I would put that on my
face but it really is fun for like a
date night or something like that and it
smells good it's really really really
really glittery holy moly
they weren't kidding about the fairy
glow next in here is a piece of rose
quartz rose quartz is a stone that I
have a ton of but I feel like it's one
of those that I can never really have
too many of I do like rose quartz for
stone purposes it's supposed to help
your heart chakra along with green
stones pink stones are also supposed to
help your heart chakra so I do like this
kind of stone I personally my preference
when I go to buy stones I like to
actually touch them and pick one out
buying them online is it my personal
thing but I know a lot of people do like
to buy stones online and this one does
feel like it has good energy I know it's
all in my head I get it but it feels
like it has good energy to me and it's
starting to make me happy so next thing
in here is something I'll probably pass
along to my daughter it's her favorite
colors it's a little fairy enamel pin
and it's very cute again something that
I personally wouldn't use but I think my
daughter's really going to like this my
nine-year-old and then in here this is
very interesting it's a super feast
jaison's mushrooms wild crafted mushroom
blend extract no ok Masons mushrooms is
a specialty blend of the world's
greatest and most powerful medicinal
mushrooms designed to increase capacity
for herbal into integration in the body
sorry am i it's very very small print
medicinal mushrooms are the variety that
grow on trees and work symbiotically
with the forest and soil to create unity
and maintain a healthy ecosystem all the
herbs used in this blend are tonic
meaning they can be eaten every day and
will work to adapt to your body and then
it says these statements have not been
evaluated by the FDA this product is not
intended to diagnose treat and that
whole disclaimer it's a mushroom powder
I guess you can add this to different
foods I am NOT a mushroom purse my
husband loves mushrooms and he does like
this stuff as well he has it's very much
into essential oils and stuff like that
so I will probably pass this along to
him but maybe I'll try a little bit
sprinkle it in something I don't know I
don't really know what to do with this
to be honest with you I'm not quite sure
oh there's a card down here well isn't
that helpful oh my gosh it was buried at
the bottom so my request for future for
this is that they put the card on top so
people realize the card is there so let
me see what it says it says boost your
immune system by adding a dose of this
blend of eight medicinal mushrooms to
your smoothie juice elixir hot chocolate
or a cup of hot water to make a tea
sweetened if desired so maybe I'll do
that that sounds cool I'll do that see
now that I know now that I found this
card I'm so much happier so the last
thing in here is this believe it is
essential oils which are very fun it's
funny the essential oil blend that I got
it was supposed to be like the calming
blend that I got with the fat that fun
add-ons for that video I actually gave
it to my kids and I sprinkle a little on
their hands before they go to bed and
they really really like it a lot but
anyway this is the it says enchanted
force fairy synergy and let's see what
the card says about this this is
actually kind of neat it says put three
to four drops of this flower essence
under your tongue or in your favorite
beverage DIY skincare creation or bath
to align the energy of nature spirits
are you ready to align the energy of
nature spirits
let's do it right now it says like I'll
put it under my tongue am I not right
okay here we go I'm ready to do lines
ooh
this actually tastes quite nice I don't
know if I'm in line with the nature
aligned with the nature spirits but it's
very sweet it's got um a little bit of a
citrusy flavor just a tiny bit but it's
mostly a sugary taste that I taste
almost like a um like some kind of hard
candy like uh like a spree or something
that's kind of what it tastes like I was
supposed to shake it well I didn't do
that it says three to four drops I only
put one let's do a couple more
hmmm interesting experience a
vibrational effect I do feel a little
bit vibrational in my face this is very
weird all along here I feel like a weird
tingling kind of feel that is weird
what is this stuff what did I just knew
I'm gonna have to google the ingredients
oh it's got 10% alcohol by volume maybe
that's it I'm not giving this one to the
kids I'll tell you that but that is
really odd I've never done anything like
that in my life that was that was an
interesting experience ok so the
question is is this worth 33 dollars to
me um I think for the experience along
with the products yes but barely and I
think that the thing that's the most fun
for me with this actually the the forest
ferry synergy flower essence that I put
under my tongue that was a really neat
experience I think I'm gonna do that
more often especially if I need to like
taking a break from the kids and I just
need a minute I just need a minute and
drop my fairy essence and get one with
the fairies and then I'm gonna be better
this right here this pin I know my
daughter's absolutely going to love so
that's a win the highlighter I probably
won't use very much but it's still very
fun and I might be able to use it for
something I'm gonna look and see if it's
lip safe because I could see myself
using this on my lips the bath salts I
probably will not use because I don't
take baths so I'm gonna pass that along
the mushroom thing I was a little
hesitant at first until I read that you
can put it in other things I'm gonna
have to google the mushrooms that are in
here to see whether they're like carnal
like the drops are gonna make me feel a
little funny
oh no but I am excited about it now even
though I'm not a mushroom person my
husband and I are gonna have to play
with this or something use something
with it and of course the stone I always
like stones rocks from always make me
happy I can never have enough cool rocks
oh I mean there's kind of a pretty low
value I still excited about that and
then the candle it's not my preferred
scent with the flowers but for a flower
scent I do like it and I will definitely
use it so really the only thing I am
absolutely not going to use is the bath
salts and that's just a personal
preference thing they seem very nice for
someone that takes a lot of baths so I
really
this box and I don't get anything if you
sign up I'm just doing this for the
small business show it to you because I
was excited to see what was in it and
try it out because it's kind of my thing

one-off video just to show you what it
was and also because I was curious about
