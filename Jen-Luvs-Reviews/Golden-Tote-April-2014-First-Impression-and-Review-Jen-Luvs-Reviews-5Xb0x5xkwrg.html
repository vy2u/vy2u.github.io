a hotel i'm actually at new york imats
will not add I'm ATS right this second
but I am in New York City for I'm at the
International makeup artist trade show
I'm very excited to be here and I'm very
excited to show you my golden toad now
the wonderful people at golden took
contacted me and asked me to review one
of their totes hey let me tell you a
little bit about what golden toad it is
in case you've never heard of it so it's
one of those things where you fill out a
style profile and after you thought your
style profile they kind of pair up and
match up styles that they think might
look good for you for your body type
that you select and for your style
preferences you have your choice of a
$49 tote which is two to three items
with a value of up to two hundred fifty
dollars or you have a choice of the $149
tote get five to seven items worth up to
six hundred dollars worth of stuff so
they sent me the $149 tote it's not a
subscription service in that you need to
keep doing it every month you just kind
of log on and see whether you want to
get a tote for that month they it starts
the first Monday of every month you log
on and you can see what they have
available and they just keep selling
through the month until everything sells
out so I was able to pick I picked a
dress and a shirt and then the rest is
going to be a surprise so I don't know
if there's accessories in here or what
is happening so let's just go ahead and
get right into the tote and it just came
in this box I don't know if because I
got it rough shift it just came in a
plain box or if this is how it always
comes I'll show you the inside and it
came with some style tips for the two
items that I picked so they I'm assuming
they didn't send me all of these items
in here that would just be kind of crazy
to send all of this stuff but we will
see and it just there's a little thing
that just says thank you for my order it
says oh here we go this is important it
says golden tote is an all-or-nothing
deal unfortunately we do not exchange or
take back single merchandise you must
return the entire golden toad and all of
its contents however since golden to it
is such a great deal
we recommend gifting or exchanging items
that do not fit with family and friends
remember what doesn't work for one might
work for another's to share with your
friends please see our frequently asked
questions website for specifics on
returns mm okay so what we got was hi
they actually give you a tote that's
kind of cool I'm always up for reusable
shopping bags and things so it says
curated in California moon for golden
took so I don't know if this is the
pattern they always have on their tones
but that's really cute and it feels like
it's pretty good quality soft for um for
this kind of bag it's very soft okay so
let's see the first thing I'm picking
out something I've never seen so this is
something they picked for me that's how
it looks I don't know about this
patterns charms a little freaky to me
the person that's helping ever boat
going to her name is Rachel and she's
really really sweet so I'm really hope
because like the stuff that I don't want
to say that they don't like it but this
is not my style at all that looks really
big and it's not something I would
typically wear at all it's huge says
it's small we'll try it on we'll see how
it looks okay so mmm this is not
something I would ever have picked out
in a million years oh that makes me sad
well let's go on to the next item but
that one's definitely a no for me okay
what kind of happens were these I'm
sorry Rachel I'm not a big fan so far if
Rachel was in my tote on be happy
because she's a sweetheart this looks
really like what what is that it looks
like a Momo it looks like a straight-up
muumuu dress okay so I think this one's
another not just not for me it's just a
maybe if it had a belt you know and some
accessories I don't know it's just way
out of my comfort zone I didn't know if
they'd said pink but I didn't know that
it was going to have this green here and
just reminds me of a watermelon I think
it was this okay so you see how this was
the dress that was on the site and they
didn't have a picture of the pink one
and this one was sold out or I would
have gotten this one okay let's move on
this and try to find something else
there's got to be some wins in here
because the shirt I picked out was super
super cute so this is the next thing I'm
pulling out see please be good please be
good I want to love it I always tell
people I guarantee and honest reviews so
okay it's a tank okay black tank okay I
can always use another black tank so
happy about this I mean it's not going
to be a high value item but I mean this
is something that I could definitely
wear okay so it's just the plain black
tank it is a tiny tiny tiny bit sheer
but it's fine i don't think can you guys
see through that I don't think I can
it's fine it's a nice time so let's see
what's next ah I bet you this goes with
this aha see this is kind of cute I
think I like this this was also a
surprise I like this let's try this on
this is really cute yes see this is a
win this is something I would wear that
is cute yes yeah Rachel this is a good
one okay good found something that I
like show you how it looks in the back I
love this style the whole baseball shirt
looking kind think it's called like
Raglan or something like that but I
really like this and with the lace this
one is cute this one is a win happy but
thank goodness it looks like I've got
two more shirts Oh three more shirts
okay looks like another dress okay I
might be able to work with this we'll
have to try this one on and see how this
one looks okay so this one's pretty cute
too I like the bottom how it kind of
flares out that's really girly like this
part right here um I definitely think it
needs some accessories some cute shoes
to just kind of bring out the style of
it but I do like this as well so and
it's super soft looks really really soft
so very very comfortable comes up high
in the back as my tattoo I'll tell you
about my tattoo another day so we've got
two wins to fail so far okay this I
think was the other shirt that I had
picked out with 149 dollar to it you
pick two things on the $59 one you pick
one thing and it's kind of scalloped has
this little cute little pattern so we'll
try that one on too so
do really like it show you kind of what
that looks like it's got these little
scallops here so just enough to be
feminine and cute but you know not too
plain not not too tacky so happy about
this again needing some accessories
count the black tank and that sheer
shirt as one so three wins two fails all
right there's one more thing left okay
and this looks like another pattern that
I might not be a fan of its floral big
floral giant floral but it's spring so
you know this is another something that
if I saw this on a rack I would never
have picked this up okay we'll sing okay
so this is almost a win this is much
much cuter than I thought it was going
to be I do actually feel like the way
that this looks but there's one problem
my belly sticking out okay I had two
kids okay I'm 35 years old I don't want
my belly to stick out on my shirt so you
know what I'm saying like and just it's
not that's not gonna work I mean it look
at the bath the back goes down lungs
sing but the front has like my belly
sticking out so maybe I can find a cream
colored shirt or like a tank like that
the one that I got to kind of tuck it
underneath the hide my stomach sticking
out um you know it's it's just it's I'm
too old for that I'm too old for stomach
sticking out shirt okay so we're gonna
put this in like the maybe if I can work
with it column so let's do a quick
rundown of what I got so I got this
shirt that's going to be a maybe I got
this a green shirt with the scallops
this is a definite yes for me I got the
black tank that went with this year
raglan style shirt this is going to be a
yes for me I got the tunic which is a
big no for me not my style I got any
watermelon
Oh No for me and then I got the white or
cream-colored and black striped dress
which is going to be a yes for me so do
i feel like i got one hundred and fifty
dollars worth of stuff this month for
this tote probably not just for my
personal taste my personal preferences
but that's kind of the risk you take
this really was fun to open i enjoyed
seeing what they sent me and i can't
imagine how difficult it must be to try
to match clothing for people's everybody
style i mean you can't make everybody
happy all the time you know what I'm
saying I think personally if I were
going to order from the subscription
service I would probably start with the
$49 one and I would wait till I made
sure a hundred percent that I was really
gonna like the item like the way that I
picked this one this I really really
loved I wasn't sure about the pink dress
because they didn't have an image of it
up all they had was image of the blue
and white one so I probably would have
gone with the $49 tote if I had
purchased this personally that it
changes every single month so maybe i
just got an off box that just wasn't
something my personal preference but i
do think this is a really interesting
idea for a concept thank you so much to
gold and tough for sending me this tote
I truly genuinely appreciate it and
thank you too Rachel for being so
awesome and amazing through this process
and getting me this box so that I could
shoot it while i'm at ims thank you so
much for watching if you enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up yeah
and subscribe if you'd like to see more
videos like this one now I love my
friends and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
