subscription service thank you to my
friend melissa from two lesbians one
baby for suggesting that i get this she
is awesome awesome so fun and her wife
vanessa is also amazing they have a
great channel will link them down below
she recommended I get a goodies box and
this is a $7 a month food subscription
service that just has all different
kinds of goodies in it so let me show
you what I got and what I thought of
everything in it and whether I think
that the subscription is worth it
everything has been tasted sampled eaten
all of that so excuse the mess of the
package first we got this peanut butter
in company dark chocolate dreams peanut
butter sample and it was a pack we got a
regular peanut butter and we got the
dark chocolate dreams one dark chocolate
dreams one was amazing and actually the
other one wasn't was really really good
to the plain one comes with a little
recipe and to an hour 25 cent off coupon
of the little easy squeazy packs and $1
off of a jar and my daughter absolutely
loved this she's for and she loved it so
I will probably use one of these coupons
to buy something from this company the
next thing we got was this cheddar bacon
popcorn a bacon flavored microwave
popcorn by JD's this stuff stunk up my
house so bad hands like I'm not even
kidding
like my microwave smelled for like three
days after I pop this like we kept
opening and cooking things like ah that
smell again of that bacon popcorn it
smells like bacon but it smells more
like bacon bits than it smells like
bacon
the initial flavor of it was good but um
once it got cool I did not enjoy it let
me show you it didn't have like um
didn't have any weird like color to it
or anything but oh I can smell it oh it
stinks it smells bad now no thank you on
the bacon popcorn goes okay another
thing that I didn't particularly like
very much no one in my family really
liked them with these polenta's crunchy
lentil chips and their margarita pizza
flavored on their gluten-free there are
40 percent less fat no artificial
anything mostly made with
to powder than potato starch safflower
oil salts and then some process the kind
of stuff mallet maltodextrin tomato
powder seasoning things like that but
they are very minimally processed which
is kind of nice because we're more of a
natural eating family they just tasted
weird to me I don't like lentils very
much maybe if you're more into lentils
you'll enjoy this more I still have them
in here let me show you what they look
like they look almost like like like
square Fritos there okay
yeah if somebody had them out at a party
I would probably eat them but I wouldn't
choose to buy them a little free doughy
a little bit but a little more potato B
than a frito next thing we got was these
snack Wells yogurt pretzels these were
good I really enjoyed these but they
don't give you a lot in the pack it's
only 0.78 ounces it's like this little
tiny bit in the bottom of it so just
beware but they are good I mean they're
they taste like exactly what you would
think of your covered pretzel would
taste like Oh Chips Ahoy got two of
these big big and chewy original cookies
with Reese's peanut butter cups in them
amazing really really yummy terrible for
you completely totally processed
definitely not an everyday thing for my
family for me but a really nice every
once in awhile dessert my favorite
favorite favorite thing in this box was
this Y Luna fruit and nut bar and I ate
this at work first neck and it was so
stinking good it was soft and it was so
banana E and this is a Nana banana
flavor and it was banana II but not
artificial banana flavor like it really
tasted like a real banana not like
banana candy like a lot of things that
are banana flavor taste like and this
one has no hydrogenated oil no
cholesterol and no trans fat and the
number one ingredient this is dates so
those are naturally very sweet almonds
banana walnut vanilla extract
rice flour mixed tocopherols / vitamin E
I'm not 100% sure what that is gluten
free dairy free no artificial additives
non-gmo which is good if you don't know
GMOs look that up the GMOs are very very
bad
antioxidant rich raw rich and raw fruit
and nuts low sodium naturally sweet no
added sugars and vegan if I can find
these in the store I will be buying more
okay so the verdict on these I didn't
you get this little card with everything
on it and it tells you how much
everything was what I basically figured
out is the whole box was worth about
seven dollars and fifty cents in
products
I paid seven dollars for it so it's not
like I got a lot more like a lot of like
beauty boxes and things you get more
than the what you pay for this was
pretty much right on I did not enjoy the
bacon pop I did not enjoy the plent
Allah the snack well I could do without
chips of like cookies I probably
wouldn't have bought just because we
don't eat food like that the peanut
butter &amp;amp; Company peanut butter I really
really like that I probably will be
repurchasing that but only for special
because that's got tons of sugar in it
that's completely unnecessary especially
for a lunch food and this will probably
be more of a dessert food for my kid and
but the y luna fruit bar wonderful so
yeah I mean overall it was pretty good
um I'm gonna get it again and see if it
gets better if it doesn't get better
than this I will probably cancel the
subscription so we shall see but yeah so
that's a good ease box I'll put the link
to the goodies and goodies stuff down
below if you want to go ahead and check
it out and subscribe to that then that
