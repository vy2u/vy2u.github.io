first review of the gourmet beauty box
now when they contacted me and asked to
me a stood me a stood me when they asked
me to review this box I went to the
website and I was like whoa I think a
lot of my subscribers will be really
interested in this because I know a lot
of you have very sensitive skin I know a
lot of you enjoy natural products and
I'm very excited to open this box with
you and show you what's inside now this
subscription is nineteen ninety-nine a
month and that includes shipping you do
get a discount if you sign up for three
months or six months or a year I think
six months you get a free box and then a
year you get like three free boxes or
some crazy so if you're interested in
this afterward i will put the link down
below to the website i don't think they
gave me it's been a while since we've
you i've read email but i don't think
they gave me any kind of affiliate code
i don't think i get credit for your sign
up but i will put the information down
below in the description everything in
here is cruelty free everything is vegan
everything is gluten-free the Creator
the reason why she wanted to do this was
because she originally she had rosacea
and she couldn't use a lot of beauty
products as she wanted to create
products that people could actually use
so it's all natural their packaging it
is recyclable they encourage people to
send the packaging back to be cleaned
and refilled I mean this is like a tree
hugger subscription box dream you know
what I'm sayin and I say that in the
kindest way when I say tree hugger I say
that very lovingly so let me go ahead
and just show you what's in the box and
they do promise at least two full sized
items and then some sample sizes as well
so when you open up the box it looks
like this it looks very earthy and it
says get excited for a wonderful box of
beauty which I am quite excited I'm like
whoa because I have no idea what's in
here and it says featuring fortifying
lash and brow treatment and they're so
other information i actually don't want
to read this because it's probably on
information about what else is in the
box that i want to actually genuinely
react to this stuff so when i open it up
that is what I see and I do see some
full-size products I mean and everything
is made by the gourmet beauty
treats company there's no outside
company so all of their promises hold
true to their brand which is kind of
cool the first thing I see is this
organic baby wash I don't have a baby
anymore but I'm sure anybody can use it
on the ingredients or water and coconut
oil and olive oil and castor oil organic
some other kind of extract that I can't
pronounce organic rosemary extract and
then pure natural cleanser contains
essential vitamins and minerals that
keep hair and skin healthy so it just
says use daily to clean body or hair is
needed so go ahead and smell let's see
how it looks it's got like a phone pump
which is very interesting i'm not i
wasn't expecting that prime it a little
bit okay it is a foam cool it doesn't
have very much of a sin it's very very
mild but I mean it's got it's got a
little bit of us of a cent it actually
doesn't smell too great it's all natural
ingredients castile soap me for a very
sensitive skin safe for baby but great
for mom and dad and the retail value is
six dollars and this is a deluxe sample
this is not a full-size so that's pretty
good for a deluxe sample full-size
probably pretty big so you know excited
to try that not real crazy about the son
of it but excited to try it let me go
wash my hands I'll be right back all
right next up let's see what is this
this looks interesting pineapple
refining mask that's kind of cool apply
to us clean face and leave on for two to
six minutes and then rinse off use three
to four times a month so it's a pretty
crazy mask if you can only use it two to
three to three to four times a month
Dead Sea clay pineapple extract
pineapple juice dead sea salt vegetable
glycerin purified water so very neat
let's see if it's got a scent to it
because you know i got smell everything
i don't know like a rose pink kind of
color yeah it does not smell good once
again it smells very clay ish it looks
like clay smells like clay probably
feels like clay ya feel while the top is
a little bit water you probably have to
mix it up a little bit I mean it's
natural organic stuff so can't all be
great smelling no I'm saying and it's a
mask I mean it feels it's got like clay
clay smell to it like a pottery kind of
smell it's not super strong it's great
to see a mask that is natural because I
a lot of them are very far from natural
so that's pretty cool and next thing I
see is a chamomile cleansing cream and
its water and her Hoebel I like a hobo
oil shea butter like that that chamomile
extract yep chamomile oil much other
stuff but those are the first
ingredients let's see what it says about
that rich cleanser gently removes dirt
and dead skin cells leaving behind a
lightly hydrated clean face filled with
therapeutic benefits of chamomile and
this is a full-size and full sizes $19
so let's go ahead and squirt a little
bit of that okay comes out like a lotion
this one has a nicer smell like it's um
it's still kind of earthy but it's a
little bit more of a fresh scent a
little more like a cucumber II kind of
smell I guess it's that chamomile mm-hmm
that smells nice it's very mild but it
smells nice okay I gotta go wash my
hands against again I got cleansing
cream whispering okay there's three more
products in here this is the fortifying
lash and brow treatments that they
talked about on the front of the card
and it is safe alternative for lash
growth pact with proteins amino acids to
make lashes long thicker stronger
healthier in as little as eight weeks so
it does take quite a while to see some
results I did have a natural one that I
got I think in a beauty box five that
really worked so i'm assuming this one
is probably summerlin similar and this
is $22 full-size product so that's very
exciting to try oh wow that's
interesting to have it be like a mascara
wand usually it's like a little serum ah
like a little I'm like a little tiny
almost like a lip brush looking thing
ooh I put on my nose you know it's funny
it smells like molasses not like I'm
going to be smelling on my eyeballs you
know when I use it but it smells
straight up like molasses is very
interesting number one ingredient is
water and then quinoa protein
interesting and oak protein and beef
extract that's very interesting because
that would no not beef excuse me beat
extract because I was like it's supposed
to be a vegan subscription and they've
got beef extract like is that like blood
or something that will be so creepy it
was beef
extract yeah what that IV I do eat meat
but you know beef extract on my eyes oh
my eyelashes this does not sound good
let's clarify this beat extract the
print is small organic herb oil lemon
balm hydrosol Irish moss extract witch
hazel extract organic coffee extract an
organic coffee oil very interesting that
that would make your lashes grow very
interesting I will definitely be trying
this and let you know because I'm
actually almost out of my rapid lash so
i think i'm going to try this next very
interesting i will keep you posted i'm
about to put up my summer favorites this
of course will not be in it because i
haven't tried it yet but this may be in
my fall favorites if it does work so
makes you subscribe and stay tuned to
see if that works alright and then the
next thing i see is a moisturizing cream
and it's a teeny tiny little guy at
number one ingredient is shea butter and
then something that i don't understand c
0 0 1 0 0 no organic oh-ho-ho oil
vitamin a vitamin B vitamin b3 safflower
oil and coconut oil ooh that's
interesting oh it's like a whippy
something again not what this one has
pretty much no scent ooh that feels nice
oh I like that oh that feels nice on see
my dry hand let's do that in let's see
what it damage does my dry hand it's
really hard to get out of this container
I'm gonna better do something to it oh
my gosh that feels so good I like that
that's nice so my only complaint about
this one is the packaging because you
get like this little tiny bit in this
little tiny little thing and getting it
out as a little bit of a pain but it
definitely works and it definitely has
no scent if you don't like sent then
this is something that's really good oh
one thing I wanted to mention that i
read on their website is if you are
subscribed to their beauty box then you
get like a percent off of all their
products i think it was thirty percent
off of everything on their website if
you're subscribed their beauty box which
i think is kind of crazy and awesome so
this is the ohc 0010 moisturizing cream
that's why I don't know what that means
let's see if it says what it means one
hundred percent natural potent
antioxidant cream contains coq10 and
vitamin A to present prudent prevent and
restore it tired dull dehydrated and
prematurely aged skin and the retail
price or is this the retail price of the
sample I don't know but it says six
dollars so if the full sizes say sellers
I may have to get this because that
stuff is pretty awesome alright and the
last thing in here is the ginkgo biloba
toner and I am using a toner for the
very first time and I am quite enjoying
using my toner so it'll be nice to them
about halfway through that bottle to
move on to this when i'm done with that
and then this is it says made for all
skin types completes the cleansing
process by refining pores and balancing
the complexion and fused with steam
distilled ginkgo biloba and it says
retail prices ten dollars so let's just
see no scent to it yet just going to put
it here just throw a lack of a better
place to put it yeah it's got a strange
like look almost like cooking like herb
kind of smell to it yeah like almost
like what you would put on like chicken
or something maybe it's the witch hazel
mixed with the lavender and the rose and
the lemon but it's got definitely got it
like a natural organic you know earthy
kind of scent to it feels nice you know
it feels like a toner you know the
weight owners peel it doesn't definitely
don't have any kind of cooling sensation
or anything like that but yeah so I will
be moving on to this when i'm done with
the one I'm currently using so excited
about that so let's go ahead and just do
a little summary of what we got the
ginkgo biloba toner we got the chamomile
cleansing cream we got the organic baby
wash we got the pineapple refining mask
and we got the coq10 moisturizing cream
I think I've said it right now so you
know if you are somebody that has
sensitive skin somebody that really is
interested in natural and organic
products this may be a subscription you
want to try because you know that it's
guaranteed to be organic and vegan and
gluten-free and all those things that
some people desperately need in their
beauty beauty products and I did read on
there that they do send cosmetics
sometimes this happens to be one called
healthy summer skin there
is a coupon code called beauty be 53 and
that's thirty percent off the site so
I'm actually going to put that down
below for you so you have it for
referenced if you want thirty percent
off their site beauty be 53 and that's
just printed on the card that's not a
personal code so and that's a gourmet
body treats calm so very interesting
very different subscription compared to
all the other ones that I get so this
one of course is very targeted like I've
said before to people of specific needs
so if you have those needs I definitely
recommend you check it out I think it's
definitely worth twenty dollars because
if you go to Whole Foods or a place like
that and you try to purchase these
products you're definitely going to be
spending more than twenty dollars trying
to find these products and I love that
you're able to test them before you buy
the full size which is also thank you so
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did give it a thumbs
up and make sure you subscribe if you're
not already subscribed I'm going to be
down in the comments chatting it up with
people that have watched the video
hopefully including you so feel free to
comment down below and let's talk about
these products is this something that
you would be interested in and and what
do you think about the products would
would the sense of the natural scent
turn you off to trying products like
this as long as they weren't super
strong I mean it wasn't anything in here
that was like potent in your face but
they was all like really earthy kind of
stuff is that kind of stuff to turn you
off i don't know but i would love to now
let's have a conversation so thank you
so much for watching mad love and I'll
see in the next video bye
