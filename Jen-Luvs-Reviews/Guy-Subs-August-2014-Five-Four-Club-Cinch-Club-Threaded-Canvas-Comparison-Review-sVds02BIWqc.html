thumbnails I was thumbnail it was fun
how and meet boxes seats box we don't
need no stinkin boxes we don't need no
boxes for our thumbnails you know what
you're here for yes you're here for guys
hello my friends welcome back to guy
subs oh yeah I'm not supposed to yell I
got people tell me I'm not supposed to
yell so calm it down John calm it down
hello my friends welcome back my subs
shh don't have any sense not share don't
share this video no matter what I don't
tell anybody because it's quiet it's
quiet here i love you i love you guys ok
anyway inside voices hi I'm Jen this is
my husband John and we're here to show
you some guy subs with what boxes are
really do this month what's the playlist
the playlist the playlist is we've got
you want me to say the playlist we gotta
we gotta show setup and no set list no
we have a semblance we know are doing
okay okay all right we're doing this
like a stretched out it's just not rocky
this is not you know an action movie I
know but it gets blood pumping yes it's
gonna be a lot of editing all right here
we go this is what we're gonna do we're
going to do five for first I've been
getting that one for a while now anybody
who follows the channel is probably
familiar with it next we will share
cinch club and then we will also cover
threaded canvas yes threaded canvas i
did a video with my kids on friday
canvas and then threaded canvas it was
like dude john didn't even review any of
it so we're throwing some stuff for John
Firth from Freddy canvas in but will
tell you a little bit more about that
once we get there 54 is a monthly
subscription and they have a style
profile that you fill out you feel like
you're your sizes some of your
measurements and then also your personal
style like what kind of colors you like
to wear if you like patterns or not if
you're more dressy casual you get the
drift so a 5-4 sends you two to three
items a month it's sixty dollars a month
and it's supposed to add up to at least
one hundred and twenty dollars retail
value and you don't get to send anything
back it's like subscribe to subscription
box style you get your stuff you don't
send anything back unless there's a
sizing issue that's true so this month
we got two items for those who care
about the details 54 comes to the house
in a big white envelope like this it
comes fedex sometimes that may
the difference if you have a preferred
carrier I do not pull it out and it is
in white tissue paper keep in mind that
I open up all these boxes ahead of time
I try on everything so the tissue paper
is not in the most pristine condition
why I didn't fold the jeans really
nicely you open them up and right on the
top is a cool car that says the perfect
pair and just kind of highlights some of
the features of the garment there are
the jeans you'll see more of those in a
second the second item that came with it
is a three-quarter sleeve like a
baseball style Jersey these are awesome
these are really in fashion right now
and they tend to make you look really
cool well I know you guys want to see
that key I keep yelling I could see what
you're saying now in the only one I'm
yelling again hurtful okay so I know I
careful bring it all down bring it all
down a notch okay so I've gotten a lot
of requests for John to try some stuff
on so I'm gonna just do a little
handycam little you know see what it
looks like on him by our front door and
I'm just going to show you that ring all
right so this is the outfit that i got
from 54 this month the top is in a size
large the pants are any size 33 straight
leg mmhmm yeah yeah look at that looks
good on it uh-huh uh-huh and then
there's a pan okay some people were
asking me about which style I choose on
the website because there's three
categories there's a casual and I forget
exactly what they're called so you'll
have to excuse me but there's a casual
category there's a dress to impress
category and there's an also like send
me a mixed category I subscribe to the
semi a mix because I like to get some
casual stuff and I also like to get some
dressier stuff so I think this actually
is like a perfect mix of dressy and
casual these pants are awesome they fit
great you could wear them pretty much
anywhere all right turn it around let me
see the back and then
also the top it is just nice and casual
shake our booty baby shake it shake it
all right look so in summary everything
from this box fit awesome super happy
with all the selections this month the
top has a retail value according to the
invoice of forty four dollars and the
jeans have a retail value of
seventy-eight dollars plus tax 1098
retail price 122 shipping $10 club price
sixty dollars so that is a savings of 58
point oh four percent my thing I really
like the outfit a lot I think it looks
really going on him it fits him nicely
i'm just super happy with it all right
people the next one that we're going to
talk about is cinch club cinch club is a
monthly subscription as well they have
two levels of subscription ship is that
what you call it the ownership i believe
the first one is at a price point of
eighty-nine dollars 99 cents and the
second one is 1 69 99 similar to 54 is
you fill out a style profile
measurements like dislikes all that good
stuff then what they do before your box
comes which is different from 54 is they
send you a selection of items that they
have hand selected for you based on your
size your fit based on your style and
they give you a bunch of selections to
look at for your outfit and you can pick
one top and one bottom if you don't like
anything that you see you can say hey
man I don't like anything I see can you
give me some more selections and then
they can send you some more selections
and then of course if you just don't
like your selections for that month you
can totally opt out as well it is
important to mention that we do get
cinch club sent to us for promotion
promotion yes that means that we do not
pay for it but we aren't being paid to
review it so you can expect an honest
review okay so i actually have both
levels of membership to show you today
so i got to pick out and out for from
the 89 99 category and i also got to
pick out an outfit from the 169
and this way you get to see both options
both the the less expensive and the more
expensive so you can decide which one
may be right for you yeah for those who
care the Cinch club comes usps to your
doorstep and it comes in a box about
this size up the screen right just
enough to get some folded clothes in
there so for the first outfit I got both
items are from third and army the first
one I got a red top this has buttons
down the front short sleeve and it also
has a sweet pocket you'll see more of
that in a second and then for the
bottoms I got these sweet blue shorts
from third and all right so this is the
first outfit from since club this month
this is a third and army top got the
cool little buttons got the little
pocket I think this is cool this is kind
of two tones so if you a little little
swollen hearing little chest pop get a
little little pop of color there the
shorts are 3rd army as well they got a
cool little details on in like a little
tag on the side with the brand same
thing on the bottom of the shirt here
little little pockets back here we'll
find back here it looks great yeah you
like it yeah these are cool the shirt
fits nice there's plenty of room here
the shorts are nice and casual they're
like they got a little bit of flex tone
so if you know you feel like you want to
break out and do a dash or you know
there's some squats or something like
that you'd be pretty set third an army
this is a large and the top and then the
these shorts are actually at 34
personally I could probably do with 32
but even with these with a belt on that
they feel really okay for the second
outfit the top is a seven diamonds short
sleeve button-down this is the preview
of this item in my hands and for the
second item these are a pair of mavy
denim jeans
inside a boom this one goes on now this
is the second outfit from cinch the top
is from seven diamonds this is a large
size the top is if I fold my arms like
this it's just a little tight but I
really like the way that it fits here so
I don't think that I would want to size
up just because of the overall fit of it
and then the bottoms are the mavy denims
and these are in a size 34 32 again the
waist on mica personally probably be
just a little slimmer these fit really
well they allow for a lot of nice
movement which I really like these are
in the straight leg fit they fit really
well through here you can see the back
here put the tag so there's that one
knows these have a really nice wash to
them they fit really nicely they feel
good to wear that's back can you give us
the breakdown on on those clothes that
we just saw so overall I think both
outfits were win this month actually if
I had my choice I would do both of them
because you know the one outfit was a
little more casual the other outfit was
a little more dressy my lifestyle calls
for both I mean I'm casual during the
daytime a little classy at night
sometimes go out to the club hopping
bottle of making it rain guys not to
please just ridiculous I do sometimes
when I'm when I'm sleeping I make it
ring yeah in your dreams when do I make
it for my balcony Third Army t was 59 99
the third and army shorts were 59 99
which adds up to one 1998 so about one
hundred and twenty dollars that is
thirty dollar savings from the Cinch
Club price of 89 99 outfit number two
was the seven diamonds short sleeve
button-down and then the mavy denim
pants the Cinch Club price on that is 1
69 99 the retail on the short sleeve
button-down was 89 the retail on the
jeans was 118 which comes up to 20 7
which gives you a savings
of thirty-seven dollars on that yeah so
thirty dollars on the first one almost
forty dollars on the second one so it's
pretty good savings against the retail
box alright are we ready for threaded
canvas we are ready oh this one's so
different it is this one's really
different if you i'll put a link to the
threaded canvas video at the end of this
video and also put a link to our last
guy subs video so you can watch this if
you want but the ready canvas is a whole
nother animal so first let me tell you
about the red cam side of campus is kind
of my baby this is the one I kind of
hooked up so every month the box is
designed by a different artist so it's
got a little L on it the the prints and
everything are created by artists just
small artist trying to get their names
out there which i think is awesome John
being an artist I think that's really
cool to support artists so I was really
excited about the subscription and it's
a tshirt subscription specifically they
also sent other little things along with
it that will show you in a second so you
open it up and you have the July box
info they also list out everything that
is on there including the artists names
and the item names for the artwork so
threaded canvas is from twenty dollars a
month and I say from twenty dollars a
month because you can go on the website
and you can look there's different
levels of membership depending on if you
want your stuff printed on like regular
t-shirts or they also have a fashion T
option so ops 2 makes the subscription a
little more expensive so there's some
different options starts at Tony goes up
from there I don't think that includes
shipping so you have to check out and
see what how much shipping is for
wherever you live ok so this month they
sent me three shirts in my size which is
currently enlarged I do really like
these that the t-shirts feel really nice
if you'll soft they fit well I really
like that on the inside this is
screen-printed tag the tag list thing
man like anybody who's still sending out
things with tags is stuck stuck back in
an older day this is the first tee from
threaded canvas and this is natural
melody in size large
you know that and there's back plenty
you can see where the cut kind of comes
down to for the large yeah all right the
second shirt see you guys do you guys
know my love for dinosaurs like I love
that that's it this is the angel Rex t I
think they sent that one on purpose
maybe they knew I loved dinosaurs
channeled attracted to Dinah sullivan
why not a man in a dinosaur team right
the second key this is the angel Rex T
in size large angel brat yeah method
angel Rex zeroed in do you see a dog is
getting you see a man wearing his
t-shirt you don't mess with him because
you know he's so bad t-rex's go to
heaven and the third shirt this one is
the crescent moon in Venice tea and it
looks like one of those Venice boats you
know there's like aa when you call those
boats that you row and down venice italy
i'm talking about a little gondola
gondolas the gondolas it's like the
gondolas it's like you roaming a pagoda
pagoda oh this is the third and final
shirt from threaded canvas this is the
crescent moon in Venice T in size large
not aluminum this is my favorite shirt
out of the whole box I don't know I like
the color of it I kind of like the
subtlety of the print little man paddle
in the moon around that's real cute
alright so now let's go into the other
things that they set now did you see my
t-shirts on him the heart print that
they sent is really cool this time is
cool and that is a cold flutter in the
moonlight is what that's called yes this
has all kinds of like crazy little
details in it you got like the mast and
the tree
in the moon and the birds flying away
it's like what does it all mean what am
I doing with my life it's like you got
birth and you got like the Blackbirds up
here probably like representing death
from above and like the spooky tree and
like The Splatters is kind of like
craters on the moon and you just take it
a little too far to me it's a cool print
it's a cool print all right what's next
all right so double bubble and I love
who choose this I saw this so like you
feel that yeah it's like a brick it's
like a brick I don't know who cheese
double but my kids she double well
Delilah does this is what I eat it for
anybody who needs like y'all development
you know yeah oh you need like to do
some jaw exercises like advanced joel
physical therapy development I don't
know double bubble in forever it's done
that's why they're getting it out there
like I got these from the 90s get rid of
them the sound is nostalgic I'm sure
they're not from the 19th is now just
laying around from 1995 exodus big
league chew and we can't do anything
with like yeah little throw in this
month was a little magnet with the
little zombie girl on it and this is
just called zombie girl zombie girl gee
you are ill it's got a retail value of
five dentists she was put zombie girl on
your on your refrigerator she's cute or
anywhere else she's a little creepy
though I'm a little scared of zombies
you may know this about me you may not
but I'm a little scared of zombies all
right and then the UH let's flip her
over I don't like doing that direction
guys stop I'm sorry I yelled at you
she threw zombie I don't like it ice
mask on that's not me Liz what does it
say it's the logo for the myth the
artist pseudonym huh alright moving on
moving on from the zombie sarcasm
alright and the last item is the button
which you get a button to expand your
collection every month this one is the
what is it Kingdom cupcake I wonder if
it's designed by the same as the King
banana game code we got a king banana
shirt for my daughter you see the theme
here got a king's cup cake royalty nice
real teen like I'm you I'm insane person
which is very similar this is my this is
any super cool and this is this is at
the bottom there's some different sized
patterned paper here and then you get to
the bottom of that and you realize oh
death we're making some origami I know
right right hands on so this box is
loaded man you got like your hands on
craft you got like your little hipster
button for your little mailbag perior
count carry carrier pouch that ya know
little Oh canvas good jacket are you get
for your gene gene jacket right all
right next to your sucking a devil
talking yeah right a pocket set threaded
canvas me I sonographic all right so I'm
gonna keep moving away from Agnes I'm
good okay and then I don't know worship
but one thing they said that I thought
was really cool yeah the origami it says
this month we decide the letter
subscribers become artists of their own
origami as the blah blah blah blah blah
tell him at work ami is and this is once
you've completed your work of art share
it with us on Facebook and Twitter so I
think that's really cool that you know
you can go on facebook and twitter and
you know you can see your other people's
little works of art and how they did it
okay mine is mine would end up as like a
big clump eating globby mess you could
probably use some go origami while and I
do origami together sometimes like that
and I probably probably work it out yeah
so what are we thinking about threaded
canvas as a whole threaded canvas is
cool I think that the the style of the
artwork is going to certainly be a
personal thing I like some of the
selections that they send me this month
some of them like
not sure like if I'd be like super
excited about wearing that print um well
and the colors were really bright yes
he's only it you got to be a special
kind of person to rock a bright colored
print you know what I mean like it has
the man you're in your comfort zone Oh
thought blue was cool i think i can see
you wear on the dark blue but the bright
the bright ones i can't really see you
wearing these are cool i will probably
rock these casually not as much as I
would rock something you know a little
bit more fashion-forward like the stuff
that I get my other guy subs but these
are fun t-shirts I think I think again I
think it's like a personal preference
it's like personal style kind of thing
all in all I think the value that you
get from this box is awesome man 12
incher style if it's something that you
would wear true I mean they seem like
they're high quality shirts but it's
just it's one of those things where you
have to be open to the crazy prints
exactly and if you would like to take
less of a risk and you just want to go
on and buy a t-shirt that you know you
like I went on and I checked out the
website and actually they have they have
a bunch of stuff on there for sale from
all the different artists so there's
some really cool we're going there
there's Prince you can buy separately
there's t-shirts you go buy separately
definitely definitely step on there that
I really like that's my spits more my
style than some of the exact pieces that
i got in this box but again I think it
comes down to personal style personal
preference so you guys see what we got
you know what it costs you'll we have to
you'll have to be the judge there you go
sounds good so that's it for our three
