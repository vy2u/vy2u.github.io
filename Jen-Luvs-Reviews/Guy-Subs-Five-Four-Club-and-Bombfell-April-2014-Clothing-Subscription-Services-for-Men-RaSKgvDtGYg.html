already do oh I forget what I asked you
so so what's the deal 54 a lot stupider
face on your face your face is like oh
hello my friend hello my friends welcome
back to guy subs we are once again
opening for you 54 club and bomb fell
but I have a surprise for you guys
because guess what we just ordered will
he distort the other day Birchbox man
sweet right know what that is so he's
gonna be open up to a whole new world of
birchbox man so the next time we get
Birchbox we're gonna open our birch
boxes together so I'll take out an item
he takes out an item and it's gonna be a
new way to do the birchbox I got to
figure out another way to do the smack
down because usually do the smack down
with tipsy in the Birchbox but now I
gotta mix that up because we're doing
Birchbox together so maybe fco fly solo
this Cohen month we'll see but anyway
you were here to see 54 club and bomb
fell so let's go ahead and get into that
what are we starting with this month
baby well 54 let's start with 54 okay
i'm using a nondescript package like
this as for the last couple months and
how much does it cost a month 54 is
sixty dollars a month you get two items
that are supposed to have a value of at
least a hundred and twenty dollars and
so far that's been pretty true i mean
the items that they have in there i
think if you bought them in a retail
location would at least that up to 120
you know last time i got like a a nice
colored shirt and i also got a little
hoodie you can see there's in the video
for last month so i don't link that down
below you open it up uh white tissue
paper oh the other think about 54 club
is it's like other subscription boxes
where you get what you get you don't you
know you can't return anything yes we
made that joke last month we can't make
that joke again and you can't send
anything back just a weightless so oh no
that's not sure if you have a sizing
issue you can send back and they'll send
your good sizes oh thats cool so this
month it looks like we have three items
start at the top here this is an eight
ounce and
looks like to me Hanley Raglan I'll
never ever spring do this there's that
most of their stuff is embroidered with
their own little 54 logo so yeah I mean
this this looks like five other things
that I on which is kind of good in the
sense that it I'll like it but it's not
different same thing with the next item
here with we have a black shirt with a
price tag on it of thirty-eight dollars
yeah it's a black shirt that is so
really thirty-eight dollars and look I
can I don't know if you can see what I
can totally see through that I can see
you I you probably can't see that but I
can I can see through it well so you can
wear it on a warm day in here yeah your
nipples won't sweat that's it I just
like hanging out this is made of
100-percent cotton and they're claiming
minutes at 38 dollar value it says have
the little 54 logo on it it's just a
darker color right here that's a black
tie me that's Colleen that is what it is
but it's three items in here um that's
cute this is kind of cute listen big
yeah again it looks wide but at the same
time I'm not small so this is this is
their large size this is fifty percent
cotton thirty-eight percent polyester
and twelve percent rayon I'm this
definitely looks like something that I
would wear it's got that's a little more
athletic good stuff so nice transition
clothes for winter into spring which is
what we're doing here in the US so
season appropriate yeah definitely um
the only thing I'm not impressed with is
the black t-shirt cuz I feel like we
could go to tarjay and get that for like
ten bucks oh I don't know I mean it
feels comfortable you know so I'd say 20
let's say 24 that I just noticed there's
a logo on the bottom of the shirt so
there is a logo on the bottom the shirt
which is kind of cool so reading off the
bottom of the invoice the Henley and
ragland's were forty four dollars each
and the fashion T was thirty-eight
dollars that's a total retail price of
126 club price 60 savings fifty-nine
percent sweet
yeah i mean the Henley's in the Raglan's
44 bucks that sound that sounds about
right 38 bucks for a black shirt I don't
know ma'am but I like everything that I
got it's all taken so you feel like you
paint you got your sixty dollars worth
yeah for sure right for bomb fell let's
do it mr. Bonta okay so what's the old
bomb fell can you explain it pump l-bomb
tell you go on you fill out a style
profile you can tweak it every month if
you want to you choose what you want
anything from t-shirts long sleeves
jackets all that kind of stuff I chose a
bunch of stuff just because I really
like getting a large selection but this
month in the last month they sent a
smaller selection of stuff because they
said they're transitioning they send you
a bunch of stuff you only pay for what
you keep you send it back for free if
you don't like it so that's pretty cool
and you get to preview the items right
you get to prove it yeah that's also
true they send you an email before they
send you your clothes and you preview
your items if you totally don't want
something sent to you can switch it out
before they send it so you have a little
bit of freedom to choose before they
send it and then you get to preview the
items in person wear them check them out
if you like them keep on me mm-hmm but
one thing you mentioned last month too
is that the thumbnails were really small
so it was a little bit hard to see what
the items were really going to be like
did you feel the same way this month I
mean the thumbnails aren't aren't that
small but it can it can be hard to tell
you know some of the stuff that would
reject seeing online I actually like
when I wear it and see it on so it's
kind of hard to tell so this month we
have a big box that is bulging at the
seams I'm not I forget how many items
are packed in here so let's just open
this thing up okay babe fish there's no
fish but there is done there's a
spongebob in here this thing is tiny why
past company of eight they just need a
little things so you hold this point i
will hold Bob he's weird looking his
nose is all crooked he looks like we got
into a fight and got punched in the face
right so we have three items in here
they don't include any prices on here or
anything like that we had to look this
up last time which probably look those
up I'll go get my computer
all right you go ahead and start maybe
alright so the box you opened up and
it's got some tissue paper it's got
their cool little sticker with the bomb
guy on it which is kind of cool on the
top we have best so the best on top this
is this is what gets me and maybe you
guys can maybe you guys can can talk to
me about this No so you haven't you have
the best right it's all it's all like
gray color and then you open it up and
there's this like there's this design
inside now why do they put like a design
inside and no design outside is it
reversible tell me about that no it's
not reversible cuz there's a big old
tags and stuff well yeah there's give it
dimension know you could totally wear it
reversed man I should I think that's the
way I'm gonna rock it will do like um
like a new school like I don't look like
a hunter you remember how like
crisscross were their pants backwards we
could wear clothes inside out you're
dating yourself criss-cross I think this
is sexy but he's weird sitting down
uh-huh I will not go out of house with
you looking like that sup girl oh and
you would try to pick me up with that
jacket on I would have walked the other
way there'd be no way you don't want to
get together and drink some paps blue
ribbons no so solid puffy vest it's a
puppy that it's Bobby vests and they
specifically show it with gray side out
and it says the price is $69 see that I
think you can rock that maybe that looks
good not with that t-shirt but I think
you wear that there it never goes with
what I'm wearing on film oh no and it's
got a little warmth to it it's thick oh
and it's by Kane and unki yeah oh yeah
Kanan hunky hunk or unk unk e we're in
which i would say uncle you are gonna be
like you don't know how to say can't
unki yo okay alright so here's the next
item yes what are we calling this one
this one is called the commune Hanson
heathered I don't know how you say that
raglan hoodie yeah raglan hoodie that's
kind of cool so this it looks like
something our hippie
we're probably hi Chad probably wait
until I grow dreadlocks to wear this one
he's try it out that's just like super
comfy but like I don't I don't know it's
like way it's like way big and I stand
up and it like drapes on me and kind of
feel like I should be like hacky sacking
on the beach somewhere in LA like you
know just chillin with my homies God it
doesn't fit me properly and the price
for this is $69 if we decide to keep it
so I mean that's I mean if it fit me
like it did on the model in the it's an
extra large that's why I don't know what
I would send me an extra large I'm gonna
move my head so I can put a picture of
what the model look like right there so
you can see if it fit me like that I'll
be okay with it but this is way too
baggy they send me the wrong size its
next ruler chai where a large uh-huh it
was the best that is a large and it fit
Minh our baby well we got next all right
so these are a pair of big star Union
straight jeans and we learn from people
commenting last time the big star is a
really nice Brando that's actually
really nice looking i like that wash and
they still washy washy elections point
to the Situation Room back pockets yeah
well you will see the back pockets and
then black label yeah I like this um is
this this is the same ran that I got
last one yes I really like the black
jeans that I got last month they had a
little bit of a like elasticity to them
almost so I'm curious to see you know
they just they fit really nicely they
weren't they weren't baggy they were a
little they just they just fit really
nicely so these are sixty nine dollars
which is which is fine with me that's
that's cheaper than some of the other
teams hey big spender wow I went way off
key on that last ah not good I wasn't
good I'm gonna try them on if I like him
as much as I did the ones last month and
probably this okay sounds good I think
you got one more thing that's it no
that's it three items three items
each priced $69 a piece I don't know the
gene the genes are probably a winning
the hacky sack apparel is an out and I
don't know the best the best is kind of
