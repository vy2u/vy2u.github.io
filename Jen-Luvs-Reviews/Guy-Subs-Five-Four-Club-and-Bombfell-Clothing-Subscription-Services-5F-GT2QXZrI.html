today this guy we got some packages in
the mail anybody send me some clothing I
got addicted what not addicted but I got
him interested in doing his own like
subscription box well in that box but
subscription service and he's checking
out some things that's awfully loud PACA
dining he was checking out some things
that he might be interested in to do
like subscription services so he's got
these clothing companies and what do
they do bank can you explain it cuz I
don't quite understand it so I was
scrolling across my Facebook feed and I
guess because you buy all kinds of stuff
online and it thought that I like to buy
a lot of stuff online too so it's like
hey you get barkbox and all that other
stuff you should get clothing in the
mail too and I do get barkbox I just
haven't made a video about it yet if
you're interested in me doing a barkbox
video then put a comment let me know so
yeah I got suckered in by a sponsored
ads and I was like oh yeah I'd like to
have some some dude shop for me the
website website called
it's five for clothing calm like numbers
five and four are the words five and
four and you go on there and you fill
out a style profile and they got like a
real big manly man and they got like
some geeky dude and some dude that's
about to hit the club and you're like ah
so you have to like pick one of those
which is and then you say what is your
favorite color to wear and I pick black
and then sizes and all that stuff a
little style profile and so it's kind of
like like how Birchbox and Ipsy they ask
you to like fill out a profile but it's
for clothing instead and then they pick
out your clothes for you is that
basically it good stuff so let's go
ahead and open up and see what he got
Hercules my way in all right here we go
all right open it I didn't look though
fuck it look I feel a belt belt belt
some people buy doubts about it they
sell belts not adult okay
so we would get we have two items the
first is a button-up blue shirt some
sexy buttons I don't know about that I
know what this turns me off
automatically because of the brown
buttons I just think that looks weird
I don't know it's long-sleeve and it's
um I don't know what took out like a
real rough cottony kind of like real
durable okay all right well now this
looks like some my way I can see you
wearing that it's like no hoody Jam
that's cute I like that that's cool
I like that I can see you wearing it so
what's the price tag on these things
they don't have price tag this one does
this one's $55 $55 $55 but I can see
that being $55 yeah you know that
doesn't seem outrageous and how much is
that let's say on it doesn't say well
how do you know if you want to buy it or
not
if you don't know how would you come
this one is a monthly subscription and
then oh so you have your be good and you
keep it how much does it cost you can
exchange it if you don't like it I guess
okay how much is it cost 60 bucks okay
so this shirt by itself is 55 I know you
can probably rock that go with the shirt
t-shirt underneath it leave it
unbuttoned and that one you'll I think
is definitely I think that's worth 60
bucks maybe 40 no is that one's a zipper
look nice yeah
it's lightweight oh it's tight too
nope I think it looks good it's waist
you know is it you sure right man it
looks short yeah sure it's short it's
too small that's sad
do you want to try this one huh no not
right now
but anyway so that's that subscription
service and then you had another one
baby don't you bomb fell
and here's the problem with this one so
I filled out a little style profile on
there and then they sent me an email
previewing all the stuff they were gonna
send to me and I hated all of it and so
I said don't send me the box and then a
week later it had there was another one
scheduled to send and instead of sending
me a bunch of stuff they sent me one
thing and so it's it's something that I
already kind of know I'm getting okay
but I'm not sure how it's gonna look in
real life so you cancel the first one
but then the second one you didn't
cancel can you just forgot about it or
whatever yeah okay that's how they get
you
but you can send it back like they don't
charge you until you accept it packaging
that's out comes comes in scrap paper
nifty little sticker look at that what
is that oh my god hold on let's zoom it
what is that look at it it's all like
niggly it's like a wiggly fish it opens
what is that you do with that you make
it going look you gotta go like this you
know it's just keep swimming just keep
swimming just keep swimming and then I
can make it pick your nose so it comes
with like a return policy clock starts
today a second opinion oh I probably
should be gentle with ripping this huh
we're gonna send it back maybe that's on
here maybe it says if you rip it you
bought it
they're encouraging me to take pictures
of the shirts and put on Facebook and
ask my friends what my friends think
about it I think that's nice I think you
could rock that and then if I don't like
it tell them what's wrong with well how
much did it cost
hydrating ten dollars I don't think
that's worth a hundred and ten dollars
that is not where the $110 I would say
that's worth maybe $30 $35 it'll make me
look really cool you just love the fish
he just wants to keep it for the fish
can we keep can we send the shirt back
and then just keep the fish you want to
try it on now
so overall babe what do you think of
these two subscription services you
think you're gonna keep doing them or no
I don't know I mean the profiles that I
filled out it was I indicated more that
I was kind of like a shirt you know like
t-shirt and jeans kind of guy and that's
not really the kind of stuff today that
I got the the sweatshirts pretty cool so
I think that's a keeper but the collared
shirts is you know it's not really
something I'm into okay well that's the
verdict on those I hope you enjoyed this
video and I hope you enjoyed hanging out
with me and my husband as we open up
these new subscription services if you
did give us a thumbs up and make sure
you subscribe if you'd like to see more
if you have any suggestions for Manly
subscription services definitely suggest
those to us down below because we're
always looking to try new things
mad love my friends and I will see you
he may not see you but I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
