hello my friends welcome back to guy
subs last month we had a great response
to all of the guys in charge over what
are we framed up right yes were framed
out yeah okay yeah sure you knew how
many hair hello my friends welcome back
to guy subs last time we did guy subs
there was such a fantastic response to
it we decided to do it again last month
John got stuff from bomb fell and from 5
for clothing all right 54 yes so the
stuff that I got last month from both of
the company's fit small when you sign up
for an account you fill out a style
profile you tell them what you like and
you tell them your measurements that
didn't really work for me so I set my
stuff back 54 club they're going to send
me replacements I'm still waiting on
those for larger sizes and then bomb
fell if you don't like it you just
simply send it back and so I got a whole
new box of stuff from bomb fell this
month hopefully in sizes that fit so
when you send stuff back to bomb fell do
they charge you anything no it's it's
free the only way you pay for it is if
you decide to keep an item of clothing
in my opinion so far the the clothing is
seemed a little overpriced and a lot of
it isn't exactly to my liking as far as
style goes but you know we'll see what's
in the box this month and we'll see how
it goes sounds good so which one we
gonna do first one that we have on top
is 54 it's a monthly subscription is 60
bucks it's basically you know you yeah
but you get you get what you get and you
don't get upset a big non-descript white
package you open it up tissue paper
little sticker on the front whoa so on
the top it has a envelope I'm laughing
because I see a color I've never seen
him wearing life have a sweet is this
plum lavender it has uh well it's purple
well it says purple but yeah it's like a
Lavin too dark it's more of a lavender
what did you said you thought a style
profile and they sent you a lavender
shirt yeah I might be able
Rock lavender but we'll try that on and
we'll see how that fits and then
underneath there and say very
lightweight zipper hoodie situation yeah
this has the five for it lugu yeah
that's more your style definitely this
is super lightweight I'm the kind of guy
that likes to wear hoodies all year long
so that's pretty cool it might be good
for like spring and early summer or
something like this Oh John tried on the
purple shirt and I actually really
really like it i'm shocked how much I
like it yeah so after after we looked at
the invoice it looks like this is a
replacement stuff for the things that
they sent me last month which I actually
really liked both of those items after
viewing them so it was kind of
disappointed that I didn't get those in
return in a different size this is
certainly not a shirt that I would have
picked out but Oh stand up I don't see
the whole the whole thing what's hold
its wrinkly and I know but I mean you
can't really see it I know but it looks
really good like I don't think it looks
as good just at the top as it does like
in a full of you I think it looks better
like in person that it does on camera
but I don't know and of course you'll
wear a shirt under that right mr. hairy
chest will put a white shirt on
underneath so the one thing that I don't
agree with is that the style profile
that I filled out for 54 was like the
most casual profile that they had
available so i'm not sure why they would
send a super casual profile button up
shirt but I'm kind of glad that they did
because I do enjoy the way that this
fits I do they'll enjoy the way that it
looks so you know and what about the
quality of it did seem like it's pretty
high quality yeah I mean it feels good
it's made of hundred percent cotton so I
mean I don't know I mean it feels good
to wear it that definitely doesn't feel
like like super dressy or you know
confining or anything like that so okay
so you've got on the second shirt we
think I Heidi dude that's pretty cool it
feels pretty nice it's definitely a slim
fit especially compared to the other
item it fits a little bit smaller it is
made of 100-percent cotton as well so
we'll certainly not tolerate any
shrinkage on my frame
but um I dig it you know as long as it
continues to fit like this I thingy
where you know your spring and early
summer sounds good are you ready to jump
in a bomb fo let's do bump let's do Bond
films in case you're curious about what
I'm wearing I have a dis out fitness
these earrings this necklace this shirt
is from a company called Nadine West
it's a similar subscription but for
women I have a video that just went up
about that so if you're interested if
you're a chick or if you're buying for a
chick and you're curious about a
subscription like this for women i will
put the link to that video down below oh
we got another fish we got another fish
on the car they talk about the return
policy it encourages you to post
pictures of you on facebook where in the
clothing and asking your friends what
they think and then give the company
feedback decide whether to keep it or
return it within 10 days of receiving
your box mm-hmm and if you decide not to
keep it you don't get charged anything
which is awesome all right so we pull
out of the box here and we got a lot of
tissue paper on the top here there's no
room for me and I mean on the bottom we
got some undies maybe I'll try this on
camera no bomb fell does send you an
email before they ship them out so you
can preview your items you can tell them
if you definitely don't want something
but they're small thumbnails you can
click on you can open them up it's hard
to tell online what stuff is until you
get in your hand um I got four items
whenever we open up the box there was an
invoice with no prices on it so we had
to go to the website to look up the
prices of the items if we decided to
keep them the first is a ben sherman
shirt the price tag on it is $95 if i
keep it it's $69 this shirt looks like a
dishrag to me it has like can we zoom
the prints the print looks like a
district it's um it looks like looks
like curtains I might find in like my
grandmother's house I like a restaurant
that yeah italian restaurant yeah I
don't know I I don't know that I could
rock that but you guys will have to be
the judge if you know that would be
something you would be interested in the
second item is a
pair of black jeans by big star and the
price tag on these is a hundred and
eighteen dollars and if I keep them it's
$89 um seemed like a pretty good quality
though it seemed pretty sturdy are you
gonna feel like a big star if you buy
them I'm not sure I mean they you know
not sure if i buy them this next item Oh
is a ben sherman waterproof jacket and
the tag on is $275 and i'm not sure this
jacket kind of looks like an inflatable
raft to me it's huge and it's super
super nerdy is this fashionable do
people wear this like this is this is
supposed to be like hey we'll take the
thought out of your shopping and send
you fashionable clothes and I feel like
um this looks like a like a like a
inflatable air mattress and you know how
much you have to pay for that if you
keep it how much one hundred and twenty
nine dollars but at least is cheaper
than 275 but I don't know who would buy
this at all and you know unless you well
if you're if you're fisherman you're a
fisherman if you're a fisherman this
would be a great jacket like you're
going out and you're sure you're fishing
for like some Alaskan like crabs or
something like we're the biggest biggest
catch or something with that show cough
you're like a really good-looking dude
here's like I'm girls to leave me alone
for a while ya know my ben sherman
inflatable oh it's terrible feeling is
that it doesn't even it's a stiff that's
like no it's like really tight here and
really short you like an inflatable raft
like it's got like that feeling look at
how short the sleeves are look we know
what we could do we could do we could
use it as like beatbox sounds and
because i think ben sherman is a british
product these zipper is on the wrong
side as well it's not the wrong side
it's just a different you american
people purchasing this product it feels
like you're wearing a woman's
because the women's are on the outside
yes this is this is crazy so that's a no
on the jet it's a no yeah I mean no yeah
no I'm disappointed yeah and then you
got something else do that okay all
right let's see what else we got the
last item is a box of mens undies and
these undies the selling point of these
is that they're super soft organic
cotton which sounds actually kind of
nice to me sounds real real sexy so we
open these up and they look like
bandanas so if you want to like wear
bandanas on your butt you can wear this
um mr. hideous what is that oh my god so
it's like southwestern flavor you know
so if you want your junk to look like it
comes from Arizona or something like
that that would be good these other ones
look like I have snowflakes on them or
something like it a little geometric
Michigan maybe Michigan I don't know
like snow I think of snow in Michigan
look at that situation right there
pretty sweet so the box the tags on here
retails for forty dollars and if we keep
them as forty dollars so twenty dollars
to look like your jumps come from
Arizona or Michigan I'm not sure about
that bad joke is it yeah it's just a bad
joke okay so my love do you think you're
gonna keep these subscriptions uh no no
i mean so we're gonna do some new new
subscriptions for guy subs next month
maybe if anybody has some suggestions
for other boxes out there I don't know
we might give him a shot for another
month I I did like the stuff I do like
the stuff that i got from 54 I like the
shirt kind of takes me out of my comfort
zone a little bit but I think it does
look good on me and I like the little
hoodie so we'll keep that rocking five
fours ago bomb fell is kind of one of
those things where we can kind of keep
going for the amusement of it because it
doesn't it doesn't it doesn't charge but
it is disappointing to get a box like
that in the mail when there's just
nothing that you want to keep it's like
right you know I don't want to waste
their money you know it's like yeah you
know I'm am yeah well and I feel like
with 54 there at least getting in the
ballpark of where he would wear clothes
but I feel like bomb fell is like
playing a completely different sport
yeah I mean I think the thing that I got
excited about with you know the
opportunity to have an online or to have
somebody you know semi-closed each month
was to take the guesswork out of it and
just be like oh yeah cool it look good
but it seems like more work than it's
worth it you know might as I gotta go
and find something up so this is our
last fish we'll see well if you enjoyed
this video make sure give it a thumbs up
and make sure you subscribe if you'd
like to see more videos like this one
and that love to you will see you in a
video very soon Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
