subs today we have once again for you
five for club and bomb fell but we are
lucky and that we have 25 for clubs to
show you we have aprils and we have maze
and then we have the bomb fell just
coming up so what are we going to start
with so we're gonna start with 54 and
these are items that I that I got early
last month and our shooting schedule was
just too busy so we're going to show you
last month's and then we're going to
show you the shipment that I just got
this week okay so 54 is sixty dollars a
month usually get two to three items
they're worth at least a retail value of
one hundred twenty dollars and you get
what you get you don't send it back
unless you have a sizing issue then they
can do a return exchange kind of thing
so 54 arrives and it and it takes out my
I him pirate no just keep it rolling be
a pirate so 54 comes in a bag like this
it's pretty simple Oh 454 there's a you
you go on there you fill out a style
profile anywhere from you know t-shirts
and jeans to you know higher fashioned
kind of stuff so the first item in my
box is a logo 54 t-shirt which on my
style profile I said I wasn't really
into logo shirts this is a hundred
percent cotton its large their stuff
usually fits me pretty well it's a
little more on the athletic fitting side
which is fine we're going to give this
away so how do you how do you want to do
that first 24 hours of this video is
live we will accept people that are
interested in the shirt I just put a
comment down below that you would like
the t-shirt and after 24 hours I will
cut it off and i will pick a winner and
we will ship that out to you for you or
some man that you love i will ship it
out to you yes we'll work that out yes
so the second item and here is a little
bit dressier than just a
shirt it's kind of a fashion t it has a
cool kind of texture on it again fits a
little athletic I really like this shirt
it's appropriate for the season I like
the color the last item is another
lighter colored item good for spring
this is also a little bit more fitting
has the same kind of fashion kind of
texture to it which is cool it's
lightweight but it feels good it feels
like it's durable to feel sturdy and
it's soft and it's soft yeah the only
thing that throws me off is that to me
the zipper is on the wrong side again
but that's fine it's not that big of a
deal i just think it's kind of funny
that's what he got for 54 club for april
now let's move on to maze yes yes me
alright may 54 again comes in a bag like
should I be careful I feel I feel me I
feel a box in here or something like
that so we'll see i'm not sure which a
stuffing all you did was cut open he
hasn't seen what's in there so this is
actually a true unboxing here i'm
bagging it's got the tissue paper by for
logo pop this open and the first thing i
see what is that is confusing me we're
gonna put that away looks like don't
sign any for something ohh sunglasses
okay so the first thing i really see is
a postcard whatever size this is omari
an info card of sunglasses the marina
handcrafted wood precision I saw it
tortoise shells like buzz I hope you
didn't get toward a shuffle and classes
I can't imagine you're wearing
tortoiseshell sunglasses open them up I
gotta see what y'all is any mortis so
I'm scared of this color it is
on the outside I hope this says it has a
retail value of $75 oh thank goodness
ism he's our marina brand I believe
their subpoena no it's 54 brand but
marina Styles what it is boom I don't
know about those not easy enough huh
come on man smashing forward you look
like a bug what do you think people do I
look like a button maybe I need to wear
him down let's let's zoom in the zoom in
a little bit hairy think so dark hello I
don't know about these the lenses are
too big that's okay you're very buggy
maybe that's the style mm-hmm I don't
know about those we're gonna keep moving
keep moving the next item that I see is
a white shirt v-neck 100-percent cotton
feels super supersoft plain white shirt
plain white shirt I'm so not very
exciting but it is the beginning of the
season it's a new t-shirt it's kind of
like an essential item not an exciting
item but I do not have any plain white v
necks so there we go we'll find an
occasion to wear one sounds good and the
third item that I have is a plain black
t-shirt which is not super exciting
either these have tags on them for a
retail value of thirty dollars each yeah
it's a black shirt I think that the big
item was supposed to be the sunglasses i
think that was supposed to be like the
big win in the box that makes it worth
the sixty dollars and then they just
throw the t-shirts in as like an extra
so here is the invoice and in in summary
we got the marina sunglasses retail
value of $75 we got a fashion tea and a
fashion v-neck both the retail value of
thirty dollars each plus ten dollars
shipping club price all together for all
of this stuff with sixty dollars this
month which is a savings of 61 point
eighty-two percent not sure that I'm
super excited about this month I'm kind
of a goof
you dude so I can like I feel
comfortable rocking stuff even if it
looks a little funny on me so maybe
we'll just like take those to the beach
or something and then black and white
shirts again essentials but not exciting
okay all right we're ready for bomb fell
let's do it bomb fell is a clothing
service where you go on and you fill out
a style profile and somebody from bomb
fell what do they call them it's a
stylist stylist a stylist from bomb fell
goes ahead and looks at your style
profile and then they pick out tomatoes
for you you preview it in an email
before you get it you can reject the
stuff that you don't want you can accept
the stuff that you want to see and
possibly try on you can also kind of
make some last-minute changes before
they send you your order the last couple
months weren't super exciting but I've
gotten some really nice stuff this month
I requested a bunch of stuff because it
is a new season and I would like to see
some of their spring stuff but they
didn't have a lot of stuff to send me so
they sent me two pairs of shorts which
we'll see I mean if they're exciting
keep them not send that send them back
and it's free is that where you send it
back you have to pay shipping back you
don't pay shipping so the only only time
that you'll actually pay for something
from bham felons if you decide to keep
it that's pretty nice yes okay so I open
this up get some weight to it for just
being two pairs of shorts can we open
these up with a motive these are
definitely spring colors so these are
Ben Sherman you got that Ben Sherman
rain jacket that one time it was like a
boat material yes so these are the ben
sherman classic ec1 shorts slim fit
stretch fabric so this is what they look
like on the back here you got the little
pockets one of them has a button you got
a button close here and then even a
little fancy button on the inside just
to make sure that your shorts don't come
open price on these if I decide to keep
them is $75 and then includes the little
pouch here with the extra buttons so
that's real fancy here is the second
pair of shorts peace feel softer even
through the bag those were felt like
more of like a khaki kind of material
these are definitely a lighter weight
material still kind of like that can
kind of feel this is French Connection
brand these on the back have buttons on
both and a button enclosure on the front
here and then one of these little slidy
jumps and then buttons down the front I
don't like button fly kind of stuff
because i tend to wait till the last
minute to rush to the bathroom and get a
little you know you just got it you got
to make it got to make it happen you
know I got stuff to do and they'll need
to be hanging around fiddling with the
buttons on the shorts but not sure about
these will have to wear them around see
how they make me feel about myself but
they feel like a nice pair of shorts
these if I keep them is seventy-eight
dollars wait is that how much it is if
you keep it or that's the retail price
let me see that's on the retail prices
that's how much a cost period that's how
much it is so for the peach lightweight
cotton new model shorts from French
Connection the tag on here says 78 MSRP
the price that I would pay if I decide
to keep them from bomb fell is $69
seventy dollars for a pair of shorts is
a little steep I tend to be pretty tough
on my clothes especially in the
summertime an artist so I spoke paint on
everything and I also play outside a lot
but that's not what classy shorts are
for right these are for like hang out on
your yacht and you know drinking mimosas
well hopefully bomb fell sends us yacht
yes I'm missing shots to go with the
shorts next time and then we'll do that
and then the ben sherman slim fit
stretch shorts are $75 if i decide to
keep them so we'll try these on we'll go
from there I have a feeling it's not
going to be a positive thing enough to
to justify that price tag yes so what
we'll see we'll see happen nobody lose
something
miss something they're more clothes in
there oh okay at the bottom is the
return policy cord that we forgot to
talk about well you talked about the
return I'm talking about that and then
they always sound like a weird toy which
we missed and I think we forgot about
what is that oh what is it what was I
meant it's a face with a tongue it's
like you know it reminds you would you
get out of a gumball machine I don't
know you flick it oh I went into the bed
weight loss it here I think you flick it
at people yeah they always like send you
toys that you can launch it people look
at go do it we're gonna hit the camera
telling the camera but flick it that's
lighting kit yeah this is where the doll
this is fun yeah so no matter what even
if you reject the yacht shorts you get
to keep the gumball prize sweet so
