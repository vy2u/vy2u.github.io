subs this week we have without this week
but this month this month we have an
extra bonus guy sub for you the
wonderful gentleman over at cinch Club
contacted us and asked us to review
their subscription service it's very
similar to bomb fell so we figure we
just throw it in with this one should we
can compare now just because the
products were sent to us for review does
not influence our view at all because if
it did it wouldn't be helpful to anyone
and since it go you owe me a coke you do
it jynx double jinx pickle jinx okay
since your name is pig for the next hour
it is not since inch is new for us this
month we figured that we would put that
one first but what's the deal with cinch
glob can you tell us a little bit about
it okay so cinch club has two levels of
membership to have the basic membership
the first is 89 99 a month and they
guarantee that you'll get like a top and
a bottom for that price they also have
an exclusive level membership which is
169 ninety-nine a month and that level
of membership is more to get higher end
brands fancier stuff very similar to
bomb fell what you do is you sign up for
their subscription you fill out a style
profile telling them what you like which
don't like what your measurements are
and every month they will send you an
email with a preview of the items the
first email that they sent me there was
some items that I wasn't really digging
and so what they did was the style team
went ahead and put together some more
selections for me to check out and I was
very happy with those so I picked out
two outfits for you guys to check out
today one is the basic membership then
then the second one is the exclusive
membership subscription mm-hmm so do you
have the option of sending individual
items back or do you have to keep the
whole thing um he sounded very sound of
very flexible so if you get something
and you don't like it it doesn't fit
it's just not what you were thinking
that it was you can send it back in the
package then
dude and an envelope already that you
can throw your return stuff in and they
and they include like a return slip that
you can fill out and send it back I
think that that's postage paid you can
also choose to skip a month if you
preview your items and you don't like
what you want he also said and I thought
that this was really cool you can just
say to the style team hey I have an
event coming up can you ship me out a
couple outfits to check out you know I
need something for a wedding cinch comes
in a box inside of the box it is wrapped
in brown kraft paper they have a nifty
little sticker on there is clean yeah it
isn't cool sticker and I was kind of
like a vintage style design on it you
open it up now all of the subscriptions
that we're showing you this month are
all items that we've already unboxed and
I've already tried on all of them so i
can give you a really good honest
opinion of the fit of them what I like
about and what I don't like about a
first outfit that i got from cinch is a
is a gray polo this is from Esposito
what I like about it is it feels like a
good quality shirt has a nifty little
logo here so it has the logo there just
to show you the details this is the
inside of the back color and it also
like the fact that it does have this
nice contrasting piece on the on the
front of the color there so it's almost
cool this isn't a large size large
shirts typically fit pretty well on me
this was just a tad large for a lot of
the stuff that i buy i might be able to
get away with wearing a medium but it's
not sad a deal breaker it's not a deal
breaker i didn't think it was like so
large that it looked like too sloppy i
liked the way it looked too and then the
bottom for this one this is from third
and army this company is out of Los
Angeles these are cargo short there's
the back there I'm not familiar with
third and army I checked out their
website all of their clothing in their
new collections look really awesome the
photography on the website is super cool
like the whole concept of the company is
is really nice it seems like they're
crafted or after pretty well this
my thing though I mean even though
they're crafted pretty well like I guess
you really wear your clothes very hard
but like the style of it is something
that I would typically see anywhere you
know as far as the way that it's they're
built I mean they look like target
shorts they don't look like they're
fantastic as far as you know anything
out of the ordinary for the style they
do feel really nice though so hopefully
for the price they would last a lot
longer than a pair of short you would
get at target but as far as the style I
don't really see much difference than
what you would get at any you know
bargain stores so it's just a personal
opinion and that's and that's the
outward appearance the fit was really
nice there are there are some nice
details on it like the way that the way
that it is kind of like angled in the
back the way that it fits and kind of
lays eyes on your leg so those little
differences do make to do make a little
bit of a difference from like say like a
Massimo brand or something like that you
would get at target for much cheaper
which by the way I do own plenty of that
stuff see you know but yeah I mean it's
just whether those details make enough
of a difference to you that you want to
spend that much more for the pair of
shorts let's talk about the the price
for outfit one so outfit one is the
basic membership the the shorts retail
for $79 and that's per the price on the
website and the Polo retails for sixty
dollars per the price on the website
altogether this individually purchased
on the website or retail value would be
135 so you would pay 8999 for a 135
about you now for number two this is the
exclusive membership this is 169
ninety-nine a month the outfit that I
ended up with is a shirt from 191
unlimited this is a long sleeve but this
is a convertible shirt which I thought
was pretty neat the preview that they
sent to me was very accurate I really
like the way that the shirt looks
especially when worn and from a little
bit of a distance it has some really
nice details on here this was a win for
me this fits really nice as well as
you've got some stuff that it looks one
way on the model and then
it looks like complete do do for sure so
especially with these especially with
these patterns and how they look you
know when they're photographed you know
sometimes the light sometimes the
distance what you're looking at it is
hard to get a really good representation
the bottoms bottoms sounds funny when a
guy says bottoms okay these are x-ray
these are slim straight fit these jeans
are awesome the reason why I picked them
is because I really do enjoy the really
dramatic washes so that's what they look
like opened up the back pockets have
some nice detailing on them these are
really neat I thought that this is
pretty gangster so you have all of the
gangster meaning a good thing it comes
with a money clip how awesome is that so
it says a whole x-ray jeans on there the
packaging is just really nice these were
a win to the spit me really well and I'm
you know I'm just I'm excited about the
the style of done so what's the
breakdown of outfit number two okay
Alvin number two the shirt retails for
$89 okay d pants from x-ray slim
straight these retail for $89 as well 89
+ 89 is 178 the the subscription price
is 160 999 so you don't save as much
money there as you as you do with the
basic package at least for this month at
least for this month but the style team
actually did offer me items for this for
the exclusive membership that would have
totaled even higher and what I have in
my hand but I didn't like the style of
those as much and I chose to go with the
the lower value as I just I liked the
style of the clothing so you would have
gotten a better deal if you picked the
original things that they wanted to give
you yeah I could have probably I could
have probably had a bigger margin there
I'm a bigger savings but it customized
it for you they do and and it's not just
for us it's for whoever signed up for it
right and they seem very open to doing
that for anybody so that's what cinch
club is all about what are we doing next
let's do bomb fell because
those bomb feels very similar the
difference between the two of them is
bomb fell charges for each item
individually we're cinch club pairs two
items and charges you one price for
those for the outfit bomb fell when you
open it up they have insert that tells
you about the return policy they also
send you a crazy little toy every month
this month it's a little it's a little
duck with like a little skull and
crossbones okay look at this let us give
you a little duck nobody weird no no
ducky look at him he's so cute I don't I
don't get the little skull on him is he
like a pirate duck I guess he's a pirate
duck from bomb fell this month I
received three tops this first one is
from life after denim it was kind of
similar to the Cinch club one similar
but different this one is definitely
like a lighter weight but doesn't feel
as sturdy it's actually um maybe maybe a
little lighter to wear that the problem
with this one is this one doesn't look
anything like the preview photo that
they sent me I didn't really feel like
this one was represented very well this
one if you keep it is ninety nine
dollars yeah yikes right it's definitely
more fashion forward in my opinion it
has the square buttons they're darker to
match the print here but it also has
like a nicer finish their detailing on
the on the cuff there I like the cuffs
so there's certainly different totally
different shirt so this isn't a bad
shirt but for ninety nine dollars I
don't know about that also I had a
problem with the fit of this one and
that is kind of a reoccurring theme that
I'm having the bomb fell a lot of the
clothes just don't fit properly and and
the heartbreaking thing about that is
with bomb fell they have you fill out an
exhaustive style profile we're not
talking about I I wear a large shirt and
I like grey we're talking about I took
measurements for my thighs my calves my
you know my oh wow my chest my biceps
like they get all of your measurements
like custom tailor kind of stuff to do
all of that work and then to get a shirt
where when I put it on I can't I can't
bring my
arms any closer than this yeah and not
okay it's summertime you're gonna be you
know out at parties you're gonna be
acting a fool you never know when you're
gonna have to throw a discus you never
know we're going to be challenged to a
push-up contest yeah you never know and
you don't want to bust out of your shirt
oh so that was a no price point was bad
and we're gonna try if it was bad eek
okay this is another life after denim
shirt the you know it's it's a nice
summer shirt the the again it's
lightweight it feels good I like the
print I do like it it's very similar to
the other one the price on this one if
you keep it is eighty-nine dollars you
know I'm just not real thrilled about
about the fit of it it doesn't fit me
right when I'm standing like this it
fits you know when it's okay but if I
raise my arms up it comes up and it just
it just doesn't fit so it's a bus as you
like the print though the next one is
original penguin brand checked shirt and
this is a little loud low eastery in the
preview I actually thought it looked a
little nicer I mean if you if you veer
from a weight from way back it's
definitely not as obnoxious as when you
view it from up front it definitely is
well put together you know the detailing
in the in the collar the way that it's
hemmed all that good stuff this high
quality shirt bad bad print this one is
a little bit less than the other shirts
if you keep this this is sixty nine
dollars which is a little closer to what
you would expect to pay like banana
republic placement for a nice collared
shirt you know and this is this is
definitely a nice sturdy shirt again I
had a problem with the fit in the
shoulders in the chest so I was hoping
since it was a different brand they
don't fit you better um it is it is it
says its heritage slim fit um I'm
definitely not a slim fit guy I
definitely I have a fuller chest I'm not
jacked and tan by any means but how
think the tans gonna affect the fit
though it does affect the fit
super tan so that's a bus i also have a
pair of shorts in here these shorts are
from French Connection I got some French
Connection shorts from bomb fell last
month that I did not like it all these
actually fit really nice these these are
sturdy they're well put together the one
of the one beef that I do have with them
which is a style preference is that
there's the buttons on the front instead
of the zipper and that can be a little
bit of a pain in the butt the the one
thing that I'm just noticing now that
I'm actually holding them in my hand and
I did try these on is that on the inside
here there's like this little secret
pocket um and that's him that's on the
inside like behind the behind like next
waistband yeah behind the waistband it's
even got a little button so that's
pretty cool take a little little secret
stash pocket I put your license in there
if you're going out you're like yeah
we'd hold a licence it would hold cash
credit card that could be like your
little tucked-away cool because like if
you're going out in the city somewhere
you don't want to keep your license in
your back pocket someone reach in grab
your stuff or whatever your money put it
inside but it would look really weird
though if you're going to like going to
go to get a drink or whatever and you
like reaching in like al bundy and your
pants i'm gonna be good but you know
just depending on what kind of plat
places you frequent these if you decide
to keep them are $79 you think you're
gonna keep those um I'm on the fence
about these I you know the this the out
the outside appearance of them the style
of them again is not much different than
you would expect to find in a regular
kind of department store there are you
know some details that do make it very
nice probably my favorite item out of
the whole box okay they did send me a
belt to pair with it this is original
penguin and it says solid color suede
the back of it is this like really
yellow color and at first I thought that
that was the outside of it but just the
way that the buckle goes it's actually
the suede color this actually wears very
nicely with these shorts so I thought
that that was a nice pairing the belt if
you decide to keep it is forty nine
dollars so that pretty reasonable for
about I don't buy belts I don't know
it's it just depends I mean
it's penguins it is supposed to be more
of a higher-end brand but there's
nothing on this belt that suggests that
it's like a superior quality it just it
seems like a belt to me you know I know
bomberman I mean you know the last item
in here is a pair of big star jeans
these are style mm SL I and the wash is
washed out black and I actually have
another pair of big star jeans that i
got from bomb fell that i really like
but their their their divisions straight
fit the thing that I thought weird about
the fact that these are slim fit is when
I put them on there were so baggy and
airy in the crotch and in the end in the
thigh area and this word weird this is
the one thing I saw him sat try on and
it was like balloon around like the
thigh area and then after the knee at
like you liked it was thought into his
calf like an entire it was really weird
like not obnoxious balloon we're not
talking like MC Hammer pants yeah so I
was a little bummed out about that
because I was excited because I wear
those big star jeans a lot they're
they're they're similar to this where
there's kind of a washed-out look and
they just they work really well with my
style you can wear them with a lot of
different things yeah so I was just
bummed that the big star jeans they sent
me this month were just not a good fit
you keep the big star industry chinos
they are ninety nine dollars so that's
bomb fell to some it back up we got the
big star chinos we got the French
Connection shorts we got the penguin
shirt we got the life after denim picnic
table cloths here that don't fit my
chest and arms so kind of a bust from
bomb fell this month the nice thing is
is that if I decide to send it all back
I will be charged zero dollars yeah so
it's no risk really the only real pain
in the butt is you know you know
repackaging and dropping it off and
making sure you drop it off before the
deadline because we don't drop it up for
the deadline they charge you so you have
to drop it off for that for the deadline
but they give you a fair amount of time
they give you seven days to decide what
you want to do with
and then they give you a fair amount of
time after that even to drop it off at
the post office so I haven't had a
problem with sending spam that's because
you're responsible but if somebody it
isn't as good at scheduling as you are
they may have a little more trouble and
then have you know six hundred dollars
for the clothes that they don't want
true because if you don't send it back
it's just boo boo ah alright okay so the
last subscription box that we're talking
about today is 54 out of all the
clothing subscription boxes that gotten
54 has at least for me and my style has
been consistent I like the fit of their
clothes I like the value of what I get
and well it's not always like fancy and
crazy you know it's it's good practical
clothes that i find myself wearing on on
a regular basis so 54 you pay sixty
dollars a month and they claim that
you'll get at least one hundred and
twenty dollar retail value in your box
typically they're sending two to three
items per box you cannot return the
items you do not get to preview the
items so when you get them in the mail
it's a surprise you open it up boom it's
yours the only way that you can get rid
of it is if you have sizing sizing
issues I got three items from 54 this
month a all about the button up system
onto the cement subscription boxes it's
a long sleeve button up and it's
important to mention that 54 is the
brand it's not they're not sending you
other brands it's 54 branded clothing
typically they have their small logo on
it and actually like where they place
their logo and there's small little
labels I think it actually adds to the
look of the clinic John's joining us he
just fell a little bit so he's a little
sad so he's going to join us in the
video for the rest of five for at least
till it gets bored ok so again it's it's
uh there's nothing crazy extra out of
the ordinary with this one it's a
hundred percent cotton shirt just it's a
nicely constructed shirt I do like to
finish the fit on this is really nice
the awesome thing about this is i
received this in the mail the day before
we were doing family portraits and i
liked it so much and it fits so well
that i actually weren't for our family
portrait it looked really good too so
that that was really cool i was proud to
work for that the next item that we got
in our box is a white shirt this is
definitely more
an undershirt or just super cache it's a
v-neck again nothing sorry okay I
there's actually people in the frame I
do that every month hey you shouldn't
hit me in the eye this spot this is a
hundred percent pima cotton their stuff
is mostly made in India it's just this
is just it's a really nice soft cotton
shirt the fit on this is good I really
like the way that that fits so that was
a win as well the third item that we got
in our 54 I opened it up and I was like
why are they sending us thermal shirts
in June June yeah it definitely has the
weight of a thermal shirt but it is a
short sleeve the problem with this is
that the sleeves are so big I mean
unless you just have like gigantic arms
they look like like fluffy prom dress
sleeves I not prom dress 2014 prom dress
circa nineteen eighty-six yeah yeah
yeahs late like the puffy puffy sleeves
so to recap 54 this month we got the
long sleeve blue button up we got the
white v neck cotton t-shirt which were
both wins which are both wins and then
we also got the short sleeve white
thermal cotton top which I wasn't a fan
of that's it for that that's that so of
all three subscriptions John which one
did you like the bestest month or is it
kind of a toss-up it's kind of a toss-up
because they're they're definitely
they're different I'm really excited
about cinch club and I'm really excited
to see what they have in store for the
for the following months I know that the
styling team and the website definitely
hint to you know that they're going to
be adding more and more as they go along
so they have some really good brands on
there and that's really cool definitely
a 5-4 like I said before has has just
been a favorite of you know I always
find items
