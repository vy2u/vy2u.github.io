subs it has been a long time since we've
done the guy stops for a while we've got
some requests to bring that guy sub so
we're bringing it back this month this
probably won't be a regular monthly
thing I don't know we'll see but it's
just gum we're gonna throw it in when we
think that it's relevant to you when we
want to show you something good we're
not gonna bore you with the boring stuff
we're gonna bring you the good stuff and
we've got some good stuff to show you
this month so we decided to bring back
the guy subs yep
so we have three different guys
subscriptions to show you guys today
we're gonna start with bomb fell we're
going to go to five four and then we're
going to finish up with best spoke post
so they're all different types of guys
subs so we're not really comparing we're
not doing a Smackdown like we do with
the birch boxes because they all are a
little slightly different and we'll go
into how each of them differ from each
other how much they cost all that good
stuff are they all clothing
subscriptions that's a good thing to
mention so bomb fell is a clothing
subscription five-four is a clothing
subscription best poke post is clothing
this month so I thought it'd be neat to
bring in but it's not always clothing
all right so you ready to do this yes
let's do it let's do this all right we
are gonna start with bomb fell so bomb
fell is a monthly thing all of these are
monthly boxes the deal with bomb fell is
you sign up and you fill out a style
profile you tell them what you like you
fill out all your measurements so you
take like a tape measure all over your
body tell them what fits you you can
also tell them what kind of brands you
already own the stuff that you already
like and so what happens with bomb fell
is they send you a selection of clothing
every month and you can just kind of
update the basics of your wardrobe or
you can get some real fancy stuff they
have a pretty wide selection of stuff
that they can send you and you kind of
let them know the stuff that you're
interested in so once a month they send
you an email and you get to preview all
the selections that they're going to
send you that month you can tell them
that you specifically don't want stuff
don't even send this to me you can say
don't send that to me send me more stuff
send me different stuff
you can kind of pick and choose what
they send you that month if you don't
like anything that they're sending you
you can say you know what don't even
send me anything this month the really
cool thing is is that they send
everything to you you try it on check it
out see if you like it you have ten days
to try it on and if you don't like any
of it you can send it all back and guess
how much they charge you zero dollars so
it's pretty rad you don't even pay
return shipping or anything like that so
I really like it sometimes they'll
they'll send me a preview and I'll be
like man I don't really even like any of
this stuff but maybe you know still
they'll send it to me and sometimes I'm
surprised and I'm like wow I'm gonna
keep a couple of these things other
months I just send everything back and I
sent so much stuff back that I was
expecting them to be like alright man
it's not cool we're not gonna send you
stuff anymore but every month they still
send me a bunch of clothes usually it's
like between four to six items for me to
try on belts socks underwear underwear
and stuff like that is not returnable so
that's the only caveat but shirts pants
all that kind of stuff so let's just get
into it yes
stop all this explaining well it's
important to know I know it's important
to know I'm not trying to be critical I
just want to see what's in the box I
haven't seen what's in the box now I'm
excited to see what's in the box okay
okay alright so Jennifer is holding the
box for me and she's gonna pull the
first item oh this is the prism cruise
color-block sweater this is an aside
size large and the price on this if you
decide to keep it is $89 this is a long
sleeve kind of a medium weight sweater
and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna try
all this stuff on so you guys can see
all this stuff on me so there's that the
next item that we're pulling out is from
the company life after denim and this is
the tournament core crew neck sweater so
this is a little bit lighter weight of a
sweater this isn't a size large as well
and it's just a nice kind of basic
sweater
for your wardrobe really no frills here
just a nice fitting kind of casual
sweater mm-hmm all right so relatively
ordinary kind of you can match with
anything
yep that's kind of my style I mean you
can see what I'm wearing now you know so
they kind of they tailor it to your ear
taste if you like stuff that's a little
bit more colorful and crazy they'll send
you that kind of stuff a lot of stuff
they send me is kind of more neutral you
know kind of like middle of the line not
too fancy not too flashy so the next
item that we're pulling out is from
cutter and buck and this is a Broadview
half zip sweater so you got a little
zippy there on the front I like that
print in the back nice little collar
here this is like a nice kind of sturdy
collar in the back here and then a
little feature on here they got little
pads on the elbows like that not sure if
you guys can see that or not them so
that's a nice one too this one fits
really well
oh what's the what's the price on that
one oh the the price on the last one
that I showed you the life after denim
that one's $89 as well and this one the
half zip sweater this one is $75 if I'm
surprised says this one I would think
would be more expensive than the last
one yeah life after denim one you um it
depends you know the different brands
call for different different prices this
feels like really high quality they feel
very heavy and high quality they just
feel nice like something that you would
get at a fancy store you know what I'm
saying feel nice alright and the last
item that we're gonna show you today
oh there's two more things in here
uh-huh there's two more things in here
oh yeah you got a little extra there
okay there's two more things okay the
last thing is the one that I'm most
excited about you're funny
so I'm just saying we're going to show
you now is from Abby and this is a brand
I own several pairs of their jeans I
like the fit of them and this is the
miles mid rise straight jeans this isn't
a little bit of a darker wash not not a
whole lot of distressing or anything
like that it's a little bit washed out
on the front here
these are pretty simple got a simple tag
back there nothing too crazy or fancy on
the pockets let's say just like I look
like a nice solid pair of jeans and the
price tag on the back here the retail is
118 dollars but from bomb fell if you
keep these these are 98 dollars my
favorite item in the box is they usually
include a little toy and this is my
favorite item it's a little Robin
squishy bouncy ball
yes they always send something funny
like I love it
I love it I'm totally taking this from
an yep
and even if you send all of your clothes
back you still get to keep the little
crazy extra thing for free I get to keep
it so we are not affiliated with any of
these companies that we're reviewing
today but we do have referral codes for
all of them so we'll place those in the
description below for bomb fell what
happens if you click or you use a
referral code link that we have in the
bottom there is you get $25 off of your
first order and we get a $25 credit so
it's kind of a win-win there sounds good
yep so now we're gonna go ahead and show
you what these look like actually on him
to get you a better view of what it's
gonna look like on an actual person cuz
sometimes that makes a huge difference
okay so this is the life after denim
sweater and these are the Mavi jeans
these are just a little bit baggy on me
because I neglected to change my waist
size this month so these could probably
be a little a little more fitting up
here but overall I like the wash of them
I do like the fit of them they're not
too they're not too tight but not too
much they're not too baggy they feel
pretty good yeah I like em I like the
way they look mm-hmm I think you look
good baby I like that outfit alright so
this is the cutter and buck the half zip
so get a little zip action here we'll
keep it right there nice kind of
Koller here so it's not like flopping
around on me
this fits pretty well these tops are all
large-size I'm about 511 right now I'm
about 195 pounds so just to kind of give
you an idea of the fit on these I think
that would look really good with like a
t-shirt underneath it I think it would
look awesome so we're just trying them
on quickly yeah so but it looks good
even without a shirt if you got zipped
up like that looks good okay so this is
the prism sweater I like the design like
the color I think it's a little small
sometimes they'll send me different
sizes just because things fit
differently but this is a size medium
and it's a little it feels a little
short and it feels just a little too
snug I feel like maybe if I washed it
and it shrunk like a little bit might
have some problems there and it's a
shame because I really like that shirt
on you I like the way that it
accentuates your chest that I love and
your arms but it's too small like it
down at the bottom at the waist it's
just too small like I feel like it's
just because I mean the way I haven't
pulled down here I mean it's it's tight
so I mean casual use it's probably the
right yeah and that's not cool so that's
a bummer there so let's send this one
back but I do like it alright so the
next subscription that we have is from
five four that's five for clothing
dot-com and every month usually comes in
a big oversize envelope like that the
deal with five four is it's $60 a month
and they send me usually two items
sometimes three items and they say that
you get at least 120 dollars worth of
clothes and that's true I'm I've never
okay there was one time that I got a
package from five for that I was like
and I'm not really digging it this month
but I've been a member with five-four
for over a year now I've gotten over 12
packages from them and everything I've
loved it's like always come like almost
like the perfect time where I'm like you
know I open it up and I'm like oh my god
I want to wear
today yeah so everything that they sent
me I totally wear out they sent me all
kinds of things from like fancy jeans to
sweatshirts to sweaters t-shirts shirts
in the summertime it's always very
seasonally appropriate it's always
fashionable and in style yeah that's one
of my personal favorite five four out of
all of my subscriptions that I get is my
personal favorite as well so we're in
agreement they're the deal with five
four is that they do not send you a
preview they send you and when you open
up the package you're surprised when you
get it they don't do any refunds but
they do offer size exchanges so if you
get something in your life man is too
tight or it's way too loose
drop them an email and they'll work out
like a size exchange I think I did that
once when I first started with their
subscription but other than that you get
what you get so I guess it's pretty nice
that I do like everything that I get
from them whenever you sign up you fill
out a style profile tell them what you
like Tom what you don't like as far as
like patterns colors styles there's
three different styles that you can ask
for there's a business casual dress to
impress and t-shirt and jeans and then
you can also click send me a mix which
is what I do I ask him to send me a mix
because I'm kind of a t-shirt t-shirt
and jeans kind of guy but I also like
some of the more stylish stuff that they
have so it's kind of nice I get a really
nice mix of stuff and I always feel like
I always feel fashionable when I wear
magic I look classy looking yes
absolutely yes so let's show you what we
got from five for this month so one of
the items that I got from five for this
month I'm a little I'm a little not sure
about I already tried it on and when I
when I first opened it up I was like oh
my god these are so awesome and then I
tried them on their pants and they're
like man leggins
kind of let's just break them out and
show you let's do let you show them okay
so they're there they're nice like okay
so they have zippered pockets here they
also have
buttoned pockets on the back so they're
kind of like a workout material like
almost like like a nice sweat material
but they're but they're styled like like
their fashion but I notice to look at
the bottom at the bottom you can make
them in tighter at the bottom so that
they hug your ankles more you guys are
gonna see these on me in a minute and
they're basically man legen they're
straight up Adam Lambert pants is what
they are like she was what did you say
what were you saying that that girl was
talking about her pants so I was
listening to a video by the Victoria
Donald I was her monthly favorites a
video and she was talking about her
favorite pants and they're these pixie
pants that she gets from torrid and I
googled him and I looked him up because
I wasn't watching video just listening
to him listening to the video and I was
like oh my gosh those are victoria's
pixie pants yeah man
pixie pants for men like what what so
you see that you'll see a minimun guys
are gonna have to tell me in the
comments what you think if these are
like hey man these are stylish you gotta
wear them you know stretch yourself a
little bit or if it's like bro you can
see the silhouette of your situation
maybe put them away that's what's
happening I don't know all right so just
stay tuned ladies the time that they
sent though is super awesome this is
this is a nice long sleeve mm-hmm
nice medium weight medium to heavy
weight material which is perfect for the
month
just a nice button-up this thing fits
really nicely it reminds me of almost
like a flannel shirt but not like a
cheesy like huntsman flannel it's got
that feeling that heavy feeling of a
nice flannel oh and the thing to mention
about 5'4 is it's all their brand right
so with bomb fell they send you all
different brands bomb fell is not its
own brand
five-four is its own brand so these are
their brand of things you can see the
tag in here so I figured I'd mention
that again with five four
we do have a referral code we are
not affiliated we do not get compensated
from the company but if you do use our
referral code you get $15 off of your
first month and I get $15 off of one of
my month one of my boxes so use it if
you want to again this is my favorite
subscription but go on there check out
see what they see what they have see if
it's something that you would be
interested in so now we're gonna go
ahead and show you what this outfit
looks like on John and I'm very curious
to see what y'all think of this one yeah
we need some feedback on these pants for
sure yeah okay so these are the two
items from five four I went ahead and
put just actually this shirt is from
five four underneath here that I got
earlier in the year so this is the
long-sleeve when I cross my arms here
it's just it's a little tight up here
but it is what it is overall I like the
fit and the feel of this and then the
pants the the men's leggings here so
know you guys are gonna have to tell me
what you think about check out that bow
date yeah pants so wait look at the
ankles
check out the ankles third you know they
have they have buttons and all this
stuff up here like regular pants like
dress pants so it's just a little
confusing to me
maybe I just don't understand the style
so yeah so let me know what you think
but it's weird I mean you can see my
quads you can even see like the outline
of my underwear and guys you start used
to that or at least I'm not used to that
so I don't know man the jury's out on
these pants but I want to like it
next bit we are going to do best spoke
post and best spoke post you get an
email the first of the month and it's
always a surprise
you can either opt-in of the you can
either opt into the box or you can opt
out you can be like no it's not my style
I don't want it because every month they
feature a different selection of things
it's always a limited edition of items
that
are specific to a theme or a story so
this month is unbuttoned and there's a
sweet button-down shirt and a sweet
t-shirt but other months actually this
current month that we're in now is
called knotted and it's neckties for men
and I just got the email a couple days
ago and I said no I'm gonna opt out
because I don't want a bunch of neckties
you don't have a job that requires you
to wear neckties that is correct and so
but it's not always clothing some of the
other ones was there was one called
refresh that I did get it was like a
dock bag for men and it came like loaded
with all kinds of personal care items
like hair gel and you know like pomade
and soaps and stuff soaps and yoda rants
and like all kinds of really cool stuff
they also had one that was like centered
around cigars they had one that was
centered around they had a couple
different culinary ones that had you
know different stuff that you could use
in the kitchen so all different kinds of
stuff mostly guy stuff how much is it a
month it is $55 a month if you just want
a one time box if you sign up for a
monthly subscription its $45 a month
there's really no reason not to sign up
for a monthly because even if you only
ever end up getting one month and you
just opt out of the rest of them yeah
you can cancel at any time so I don't
know why you wouldn't sign up unless
you're just like you know I just I don't
see anything else that I want but I
really like that one because you can go
on and you can actually shop there pass
boxes some of their stuff they totally
sell out of some of their stuff they
have the boxes still available they also
have a storefront so whenever you get
your box every month you can add stuff
to your box and you get free shipping
with it so they always kind of send you
the email and they show you the
selection for the month and then they
kind of show you some items that would
go well with it so they kind of upsell
you a little bit but you can totally opt
out all that stuff every once in a while
I get my box
look down I'd be like oh man that's a
really cool item you know bloop I'll
have that to my cart so that's kind of
neat it's pretty smart of them too yeah
so it's it's it's pretty cool it's it's
neat kind of guy stuff you know and you
get it delivered right to your house um
but then once you order it once you get
it you got it it's yours once you get it
you got it it's yours yeah but I was
reading on their FAQ that if you like
accidentally forget to opt out and you
get a box and you're like man what does
this I forgot to opt out you can
actually hit customer service up and
they'll send you they'll send you a
shipping label and you can send it back
if you don't open it yeah I mean it has
to be unopened unused kind of stuff this
is what I gathered I thought that was
kind of neat nice but pretty much you
know you like customer service yeah so
you check it out if you like it you're
like cool send it to me if not you just
opt out of it I like my cosmonaut I like
when brands are not shady like that like
I feel like some brands let they try to
trick you into like continuing it like
they tried they don't let you out of
your contracts and they you know trying
to get money out of you in any way
possible I think that's awesome that
they like oh if you make a mistake we'll
help you out yeah I think that's cool
think that builds a good relationship
between the company and the clients you
know yeah they all sign that was
specifically in the in the FAQ so it's
like you don't even have to like hunt
down customer service for it so yeah
pretty transparent let's use in the box
all right so there I know right yes
unbuttoned so the neat thing was is when
you opted into the box you could
actually choose from a few different
colors as well so that was pretty cool I
like blues and grays so naturally that's
what I got I didn't open these and try
these on yet because I wanted to show
you kind of the presentation of the box
here it just comes like you know really
nice and I opened up all my other stuff
and so I figured it'd be nice to kind of
show you guys something that was still
in the package but I'm gonna open them
now okay so the button-down is pretty
sweet this is kind of nice like I would
call this like meat the print was pretty
medium heavy yeah medium heavy the nice
thing about this is that
has like a little bit of like like a
pattern pop in the pocket here so that
when you're wearing that I kind of like
pops open a little bit we're going to
try it on in a second so you can see it
on this feels really good it feels nice
and soft so I'm interested to see how
that fits the second item that we got is
a short sleeve t-shirt and again it has
the pocket in the front here and it has
a little pattern there so when you put
it on kind of get a little bit of the
chest pop action there you get just a
little hint of color which i think is
pretty neat
so this again is a really nice soft
feeling fabric but it's heavy weight for
our t-shirt yeah it doesn't feel cheap
at all it feels really like nice and
heavy and strong again I'm really
interested to try this on in a second to
see how this fits and how it forms to
the body because that makes a big
difference in a t-shirt that's true okay
so that's that so for best poke post we
also have a referral code for them but
when you use our fertile code for best
poke post there's no discount for you
which is kind of a bummer and I actually
call best blog post today and I was like
is this true like we get a $25 credit
but the people who sign up don't even
get a discount and she's like no it's
like okay so that's a bummer if you do
like best photo post and you want to use
our referral code that would be great
because it does give us a little bit of
a discount on future boxes but it
doesn't benefit you at all so no hurt
feeling all the links directly to the
websites down below too so that if you
just want to go directly the website you
don't want to use a referral link we're
gonna put those for you too so whatever
makes you happy makes their us happy
whatever you're comfortable with that's
fine with us as their enter us yeah very
true aren't you ready to try on the
stuff from best poke post let's try it
on all right sounds good
all right so this is the short sleeve
from best poke post I definitely like
this you can see a little bit of the
pattern here it fits me really nicely
even if it shrinks just a tiny bit it'll
fit pretty well I like the overall cut
of it the style of it
that is good okay so this is the long
sleeve from best boat post and this is
paired with the short sleeve that they
sent
so this layers really nicely I love the
way that this fits it's like the perfect
length here it fits my body really
nicely please feel good fold my arms
nice and easily so there's enough room
up here in the shoulders which is
sometimes a problem with me
I really like this what do you think I
love it yeah yeah it looks awesome sweet
so those are all the outfits for guy
subs this month we had bum fell we had
five for club and we had best both posts
we would love to hear your thoughts in
the comments below I've been getting a
lot of comments lately on my husband's
looks and that's fine with me I'm
totally securing my relationship I'm
cool with that okay and and on and you

think that he might not be interested in
women and I could guarantee you that he
is interested in women I'm gonna promise
you that I feel I feel pretty confident
