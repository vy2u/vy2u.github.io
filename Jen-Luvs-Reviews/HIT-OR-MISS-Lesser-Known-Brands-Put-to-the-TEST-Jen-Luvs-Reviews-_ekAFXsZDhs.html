hair in skincare review video I've had a
bunch of brands sending me hair and skin
care with no obligation to review it now
I've been trying all of these products
for a really long time some of them for
many months so I've got a really great
idea of how I feel about it so I want to
share that with you if you're wondering
why I have such a light makeup look on
today it's because I just did a 5 minute
makeup challenge video that I just
filmed for polished choice that's a
sponsor video so if you're interested in
that video and how I got this look in 5
minutes I will link that down below
we're gonna go ahead and start with the
haircare products and then we're gonna
go into the skin care if you are
interested in the skin care products
only the time stamp for the skin care
products is right here Dan so go ahead
and skip a tip to there if you'd like to
only hear about the skincare so let's go
ahead and start with the haircare we're
gonna start with a brand called derma
organic now one thing that stands out
about this particular brand is that
they're very into the quality of their
ingredients they're very into being
organic being natural so they're gluten
free paraben be paraben free not paraben
be paraben free they don't have any
artificial preservatives sulfates salt
sodium chloride petrolatum or petroleum
it says petroleum specifically MEA or
DEA colors or dyes and I'm pretty sure
it says that about all of them each
product has its own list but I'm pretty
sure they all say it pretty much the
same thing so the first thing I want to
talk about is the ones that I didn't
like quite as much which was the shampoo
and the hair mask the shampoo is good in
that it works it definitely works but if
you're one of those people like me who
really likes a lather an unnatural not
organic lather you will not like this
because it does not give a lather but if
you don't care because all you care
about is having natural stuff on your
head you will really like this I think
it does a great job it is made with
argan oil it's sulfate free it's color
safe I haven't found it to shrimp my
hair on my hair is color treated it's
done a really great job with my hair it
just doesn't give me the suds enos that
I love
you know what I'm saying the hair mask I
don't feel like is it intense enough of
a mask for me it's good for a
conditioner but I don't feel like it's
got the power of a mask for me again
probably due to all of the natural
ingredients in them so these I didn't
prefer for me personally but if you like
all that natural organic kind of stuff
you may actually really like these
that's why I wanted to show them to you
next up we have the firm hold volume
foam it says alcohol-free volume lift
supports amplifies curls and waves so
what I do with this is I mix this into
my hair before I dry it and I find that
my curls will stay longer because these
are not natural curls girlfriend because
our boyfriend because you know I don't
know anybody that's got this kind of
natural curls I wish I did my hair looks
like a frizzy disaster I mean some of
you have seen my hair when it's not done
it's a mess so this really helps to keep
my frizz under control and helps the
everything to kind of hold better I try
to keep it away from my roots though
because I feel like it kind of weighs
down my roots so I try to just keep it
kind of from here down the other product
is the leave-in treatment repair protect
and shine this also has Moroccan oil in
it this is really nice on wet hair but I
also use it on dry hair on occasion it's
got a very nice sweet candy-like scent
to it almost like a tropical league
sweet scent and it's very light so I
really like this a lot it's very nice to
treat to kind of tame the flyaway so
this is a really good one as well
the second brand is a brand called Mitch
stone essentials and this says luxury
repair and style this is the nourish
leave-in treatment and styling potion
again I put this on my hair after I take
a shower when my hair is just damp I
don't put it on my wet hair I put it on
my damp hair so I dry it a little bit or
I let it air dry a little bit and then I
use it
it's a leave-in treatment so it gives
kind of a hydration to your hair and I
really like this is it blowing my mind
no but I do enjoy it and I feel like it
works I feel like it does what it says
it's going to do which is tame my
flyaway so it makes me really happy but
what I really liked from this line was
the luster drops and I love these when I
just had like though the blonde on just
the tips I would straight
more now I don't really like the way my
hair looks straight with this much color
on it I like it better curled but when I
did have just the tips I would use this
to kind of go down my straight hair and
I really like this it's very comparable
to this one but this one has a
grapefruit scent which smells amazing
and I feel like this one's a little bit
thicker so it's a little bit more
intense of a treatment where this one's
a little bit lighter so if you want
something a little thicker a little bit
more smoothing a little bit more
softening this one's probably better if
you want someone a little something a
little less intense maybe something a
little lighter this is the one you want
to go with but I really like this one a
lot this one makes me super happy and I
love that I can use it on my wet hair or
my dry hair and it's also a heat
protectant which is fantastic so moving
on to skin care I got a bunch of
products from this a SDM Beverly Hills
brand and if you're a part of my
facebook group you know I was freaking
out over this stuff I was a little
scared of it and honestly I am still
scared of it but I found that a lot of
people in the Facebook group which is
group slash facebook.com slash group
slash what's it been makeup a lot of
people ever they are not scared of this
so if you are not scared of things like
this then this may be something good for
you this is like an at-home peel
treatment so what you get is you get a
the pre peel treatment pad so you put
this on first and then you have this 10%
glycolic acid medical strength glycolic
acid this is the product that freaks me
out you do have to neutralize this with
baking soda when you're done so you put
this on using a cotton pad and then
after that then you use the post peel
treatment serum to kind of bring
everything down to calmness get your pH
back all of that and I will tell you let
me show you what this looks like outside
the box I put it away because it I will
tell you I did feel some burning on my
skin when I use this which is normal for
a product like this it kind of had like
a tingly Burnie kind of feeling but
that's normal but it just it was a
little too much for me it was a little
too intense for me but I will tell you
that I really like the way my skin
looked after I used it and if I can stop
being such a wimp then I will probably
continue to use it because I am such a
wimp I have not you
since the first time I used it because
it just freaked me out
but I do recommend it if you are used to
things like that if you like things like
that I definitely recommend trying it
because again I did really like the
effects of it the product I've been
using a lot by them is the 100% cure
hyaluronic acid serum I use this every
day and every night and I love this
stuff
hyaluronic acid is a great anti-aging
ingredient and I have really been
enjoying this it's an oil dropper so I
just kind of take this and I drop this
into my skincare and I kind of mix it
together and emulsify it with my skin
care and I just kind of go boom with my
moisturizer and I really really love
this a lot I've been very much enjoying
that that's my big recommend of
something that I've tried and really
loved the last brain I want to show you
was a brand called osmotics Thomas
cosmeceuticals if I can say that they
sent me a few products from their
skincare line so this is the aunt age
prevention protection extreme SPF 45
moisturizer now this is a very intense
moisturizer so if you have dry skin
you'll probably really like this I found
it to be a little too intense as far as
the moisturizing for me and it also has
a sunscreen scent to it which kind of
puts me off a little bit but it did work
I have to tell you it did work as far as
hydrating my skin it was just a little
bit too intense for my normal skin this
I think that you would really like if
you like spring things on your face if
you know me you know I don't like to
spray things on my face but it does feel
very nice I have to admit I just don't I
can't do it I can't do it and I know I'm
in the minority there and that's why I
wanted to tell you about this this is
the blue copper 5 cooling moisture mist
it says as natural humectants that plump
and smooth the look of fine lines and
wrinkles I did not see any immediate
effects of this but I only used it a few
times because again I hate spraying
things on my face there's something
about just something coming at my face
that I just hate I just I don't like it
but if you do like it it did feel very
nice on the skin this is a product I
didn't use a whole lot I have to admit
to you this is the cellulite control
body glow CC cream I didn't see any
difference when I did use this but the
reason why I didn't want to review this
is because I just started going back to
the gym and I didn't
it would be fair to review a cellulite
cream when I've been doing leg day and I
don't I just don't think that it would
be scientifically okay to do that it
does feel very nice if you like a lotion
and you want to try to get rid of some
of your cellulite I didn't see any
reduction in cellulite but I also didn't
use it for long enough and I can't
really give a full review on that but
it's not a yes it's not a no it's an I
don't really know it does say that it's
a CC cream it's got a little bit of a
color to it you can see here like
there's a little bit of the color that
comes out but I didn't see any
noticeable difference in tone on my skin
tone so I don't think that the CC part
really made any difference for me
personally but you know just so you know
this exists if it sounds cool you might
want to try it with the product again
the one that really stood out to me that
I really liked was the skin rescue
nourishing oil once I had tried the
hyaluronic acid for a while I took a
break from that and I started using this
this is another one I really like a lot
it's a very thin watery kind of serum E
oil not watery but like a serum II kind
of oil it's very thin it says natural
oil blend repairs dry damaged skin now I
don't have dry damaged again I have
normal skin but it felt really nice on
my skin I use this as a serum before my
moisturizer after my cleanser and my
toner I just really like this so for
ingredients this has organic coconut oil
sweet almond oil sunflower oil evening
primrose oil all rich in vitamins and
essential fatty acids it has red
raspberry oil rich in omega-3 and
omega-6 fatty acids so it's got a lot of
good ingredients in here and I did
really enjoy using it so if you like
things like that and you're ordering
from this brand I definitely would
recommend picking this one up this was
my favorite so that's it for my review
