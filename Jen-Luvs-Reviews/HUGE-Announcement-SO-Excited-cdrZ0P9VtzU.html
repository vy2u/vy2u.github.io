hello my friends I have a very exciting
announcement for you I'm so excited
about this I can't even I can't even
contain myself so no i am not starting
my own makeup line no i'm not partnering
with real style to develop anything I
you know none of that none of that what
I've decided to do was develop something
that I thought would be helpful not just
as a functional tool but also to help us
develop a community here and help us be
that collective brain of makeup
awesomeness that I've always wanted us
to be the months of a makeup chat has
done really well for that but I want to
take it one step further I have created
a what's up in a makeup appt yes there
is now an app called what's up in makeup
it is in the app store also available on
Android and I will link them down below
and this is basically what it is you
will have access to all of my videos
including what's up and makeup and when
you click on the newest what's up and
make up you will be able to see the
video description including every single
new product they came out that week so
while you're at Sephora you'll be able
to open up the app and see the list of
everything that came out that week
online you'll be able to flip back to
old episodes to see what came out in
previous weeks online so you know what
the latest and greatest products are
while you are in the store without
having to watch any videos or anything
they'll it'll be right there for you so
I'm really excited about that the second
big part of the app is like an Instagram
type section so this is a place not only
for us to get to know each other but
also to share product information so
there is a section for you to post your
box opening so we can all see what we
got in each other's you know if see bags
and and are you know burch boxes and our
box each arms and everything we can post
all of our pictures there and we can
talk to each other about what we got you
can also post your halls there and show
everybody what you're fine you can post
your product reviews and things that you
are enjoying so we can all learn from
each other about the best and worst
products that we're buying so that we
can help each other to make good buying
decisions there's also going to be a
Social section working just take you
know face the day
out for the day you know this is what
I'm doing right now you know picture of
your dinner like whatever you want to
put a picture of that you're excited
about there's going to be a social
section there as well and it's going to
be I'm sure a relatively small community
at first so we can all really get to
know each other and talk about
everything now in order to partner with
being in order to do this app i also
created a pay section this section is a
dollar 99 to join just this section now
everything I've mentioned up to this
point is absolutely one hundred percent
free but then this part that I'm about
to tell you about is 199 flat fee and it
doesn't cost anything beyond that with
once you pay the dollar ninety-nine you
don't there's no recurring fees and
there's no additional add-ons so what
I'll be doing for the paid section is i
will be showing you videos that will not
be uploaded to my youtube channel so
let's say I get my box each arm in the
mail I'll you know without my phone and
videotape my boxy charm box open I name
give you a first impression I go to the
drugstore pick up a couple of things
show you what I'm buying I tried a
lipstick for the day I can shoot on my
iPhone just really quickly you know what
I thought of the lipstick things like
that just first impressions and product
reviews and things like that that I
won't be putting on my youtube channel
that way the reason why I feel like this
is worth a dollar ninety-nine is because
I'm going to be putting videos up and
showing you extra information that you
won't be able to get anywhere else now
that was part of my deal with veem was
to create a page section so please don't
hate on me for creating a page section
it was just part of the deal if I wanted
a nap I needed to have a page section
and they gave me a choice of either
doing just an audio clip or video clips
once a month now I told them I want to
do more than once a month video clips
and they're okay with that and I feel
like that's really what's going to make
it awesome to be the paid section now
like I said before if you don't need any
of that you don't want me that you can
download the app and it's completely one
hundred percent free for everything else
the whole community aspect access to the
video is access to the what's up in
makeup description list all of that is
one hundred percent free so it's really
what you're interested in now the reason
I'm going to be able to upload so much
to that is because I won't need to set
up all my lights I don't need to be in
full face makeup I don't need to worry
about any of that because anybody that's
gonna pay that dollar ninety-nine it's
gonna be someone that doesn't really
care about all the extra hoopla that
goes on on YouTube you care about the
nitty-gritty you care about the product
reviews you want to know in formation
and you don't care about all the fluffy
frou-frou stuff that goes on besides
that you just want to know about those
products and how awesome they are or how
much they're not awesome and that's what
I'm going to provide for you in the page
section so I hope that you are as
excited about this app is I oh oh my
goodness like I couldn't explode i'm so
so excited you know I just I feel like
this is gonna be a great way for us to
connect as a community and also a way to
share information about makeup even more
than we ever have before I just I just
can't wait to get this all rolling and
to see you guys and talk to you guys on
the top so i will link all the
information about how to download the
app where it all is and everything down
in the description below I thank you so
much for watching mad love to you and I
will see you very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
