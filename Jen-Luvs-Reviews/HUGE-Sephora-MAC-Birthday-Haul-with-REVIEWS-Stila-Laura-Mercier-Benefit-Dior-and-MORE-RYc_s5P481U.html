part of my birthday haul now this
actually has a lot more products than
last time the last video i shot the
stuff that i got for my birthday was
just the four pallets that I got I got a
lot more stuff than that so but lots of
stuff to tell you about I'm going to try
to go through it as quickly as possible
let's just get right to it first I want
to start off with the things that I took
back there were a couple of products
that did not work for me so I took them
back the first one was the naked skin by
urban decay I know that it's wonderful
for a lot of people but for me it just
wasn't worth that extra money it wasn't
better than my drugstore products later
on I'll tell you what I got instead and
why I might be taking that back to the
next thing I took back was a mac
lipstick in Vegas vote I did not like it
because it just wasn't my style of
lipstick I don't like lipstick that is
very opaque and Vegas boat looks like
paint to me it was a pretty color i put
it up on keek a lot of my keep friends
and if you want to be one of my key
friends follow me on keek it's an iphone
smartphone app a lot of them said it
looked great on me but it just wasn't my
style so I returned that as well hey the
next thing that I returned was a stila I
shadow and i got these count the
countless color pigments i have been
looking at forever and i really really
wanted that's a loud bird I really
really really wanted them I ended up
with two and I'll tell you about these
later but and I had the brown one and I
returned it for this green one green and
blue one I have so many brown eye
shadows and I was like you know I don't
need this I'd rather get something that
is something that I don't already have I
told you that I got me naked skin and
how I returned that I returned it and
got this josie maran argan matchmaker
serum foundation okay so see how it's
really like kim this is the light to
medium and then you blend it see how
it's real white but then it blends into
my skin let's see how it's kind of pinky
and i'm more of an olive tone and also
when you if you put on even the
slightest bit too much its oil
I don't know if you can see how shiny
that is because it does have the argan
oil in it if you have dry skin you may
be able to get away with this and be
okay with it but if you have oily skin
or normal to oily skin I would not
recommend this foundation at all i'm
debating whether i'm going to keep it
okay now on to the things that I loved
okay I got so much great stuff may be
able to start with faced and we'll work
our way to like cheeks and then we'll go
to eyes and thence ellipse I did not get
any hair or skin care products all
makeup and this was I didn't think I
mentioned this this was all mostly at
sephora and then I went to Mac for a
couple little things now oh my gosh if
you know Mac you know what this is
already this is a mineralized skin
finish by mac and of course I've heard
all over YouTube how awesome this stuff
is and this is thirty dollars like this
is really expensive but seriously i will
probably repurchase this because it is
that amazing and I don't say that
lightly I've not purchased $30 powder
but I went nuts because my husband told
me I could and I got this and I
absolutely love it I got it in the color
medium and I just love the way it feels
it feels very light and very um not very
smooth to go on a perfect and say it
lasts a very long time and its just oh
just the mattifying effect of this is
just beautiful and i would recommend
this even for the price i would
recommend it another phase product that
they did not talk about yet was the
Beauty Blender I finally broke down and
got one of these the reason why it took
me so long to get this is because of the
price I could not see how $20 was worth
it for this sponge I mean how good can
be all can it possibly be this is what I
didn't understand about the Uni blender
okay if you don't have one of these and
you use either your fingers or a brush
notice the next time you put your
foundation on and the streakiness that
happens when you use a brush at least
the brushes that I've used or your
fingers and how long it takes you to
blend your foundation this cuts that
blending time down because you don't
have that same streakiness when I was in
the mac store I heard a girl asked about
the match foundation and how it is
applied
and the lady was like um with a brush
and then she proceeded to explain the
reason why you should not use a beauty
blenders because it will suck up your
foundation and it probably does to an
extent but if you properly wet it and
squeeze all the water out beforehand I
don't feel like it absorbs a lot of the
foundation I do feel like the majority
of the foundation is going on my skin
and I am very happy way that really
leaves such a beautiful beautiful finish
I will never go back to using a brush I
don't think ever again now I've never
tried any of the other blenders the
aren't the beauty blender so i can't
speak to those but i will tell you that
this one to me was worth the twenty
dollars for a makeup addict if you are
not to make an additive you don't care
about the extra time with the your
fingers or with your with a brush then
you don't want to buy this so let's move
on to cheek products one thing that I
got that I love is this tart blush in
tip sake this blush is just so beautiful
let me show you I mean just gorgeous
gorgeous coral color it's like orange to
coral but you can see it's not scary it
goes on beautifully there's a second
squash just get nice and dark for you to
say it's not like oh my gosh I have
orange and coral my cheeks and it's like
I look like a clown no it's not like
that it's just it is a beautiful natural
color especially if you have a coral lip
or a coral shirt I mean it just really
really looks nice or contrasting colors
from the opposite of coral such as like
a blue or green it looks really really
nice so to kind of make that green or
blue pop I'm having that coral is
beautiful other blush that I got is by
Kat Von D and oh my gosh it's in
bellissima it kind of reminds me of
orgasm a little bit what but without the
sparkle this is a matte blush so there's
the finger swatch on that and let me
put that right next to the Tipsy there I
mean you can definitely see that the
tone it's like a pinky um like a pinky
peach color and it's really really
really pretty as far as we're on these
these are like very long wearing blushes
I highly recommend both of these okay I
did get a laura mercier like little kit
and I'll put the picture of that product
there yeah I got another one of these
little mini mosaics and if you see these
in the store and you see something like
I highly recommend these mosaics alright
what I love about this is you can use it
as a blush or a highlighter so you can
use just these down here as a highlight
you can also use this as a blush so if
you see there that's the blush color and
then if you mix them together they're
kind of a highlight II kind of blush so
i'm going to show you that that looks
like all mixed together so those are
kind of your three choices with this
which is awesome and i'll show you how
those swatch
I mean just just absolutely gorgeous I
mean what a versatile product if you see
any of these I would recommend them I
have the golden one and then i have this
pink one now and i love both of them
they're both awesome the last chic
product that i wanted to tell you about
was in my birthday little kit and it is
though it's upside down it is the Watts
highlighter by benefit and I really
didn't think I was gonna like this just
because I haven't heard much about it
but I mean it is fabulous let me show
you what it looks like it is a beautiful
highlight I really really like it a lot
I've used it for for highlighting my
cheekbones I've used it from my eyebrows
I don't highlight my nose because Mom
nose is big enough on its own but I
really really have been enjoying this
and will probably reap well I didn't
purchase it will probably purchase this
when I run out of it um based on my
highlighter situation at the moment
moving on to eyes the first thing I got
four eyes was an eyeshadow base from Mac
called painterly and I know this is
something that you have never heard of
haha you've probably heard of this from
a gazillion people and it's just an
eyeshadow base it works great it does
exactly what it's supposed to do but you
can see it's kind of close to my natural
color it's a little bit more tan toned
increase less really really nice base
absolutely love it for what it is is it
necessary no is it nice yeah definitely
okay another I product that i got from
the laura mercier kit was the the eye
shadow it's a caviar stick and pink
spark and I'll show you what that looks
like it's a rollup little crayon I love
these caviar six if you don't have any
you should definitely check them out
next time you're in sephora or wherever
you buy these kinds of products goes on
very very creamy it's up here and it
does not blend once it dries so you got
to be really careful and make sure you
blend it however you want to blend it
before it drives this can make for a
nice base it can make for a nice
highlighter inner corner it's really
really pretty i love these bare minerals
loose powders um i have think this is
like my 5th one and this one is in seoul
it is a peach
a yellow tone really nice highlighter
color swatch it you I mean just really
really pretty and watch the way it
blends see how it blends but it doesn't
go away that's what I love about these
bare mineral shadows when you're
squatching shadows in the store that's
what you want to look for is when you
blend it um you know swatch it on your
hand blend it and see if you can still
see it if it blends away don't buy it if
it kind of blends out but doesn't go
away that's what you're looking for it's
awesome and these are the Steelers
Steeler the selah countless color
pigments I had gotten like I said
earlier the brown one I returned it and
got this green one this one is in light
show and I'm wearing that today I don't
know if you can see it but really these
are toys okay these are just fun toys
these are not functional I products this
is not something you're going to want
for everyday wear this is just something
fun to play with every once in a while
just like that Laura Mercier mosaic
blush you can see all the colors you go
I really love this yellow green tone
you've got this dark blue that's my
Beauty Blender can you not touch it so
just within this one shot you have all
those tones when you try to blend these
together um you really get that mosaic
look um it is kind of hard to get your
eyes to look the same because of the way
that it goes on the brush the other one
that I got I'll show you so this one is
in finale and I'll show you what that
one looks like and it's really red now
hey it's very very red and pink John
John is this that it's pink when it
comes out super red when you swatch it I
mean just very red I mean like vibrant
vibrant red swatch I know again you can
kind of see all the different colors and
then yeah
oh god you're gonna see how it goes very
good mm-hmm so those are kind of the
tones you're going to get in this one
again are really fun I know you see
again a really really fun toy I got a
lot of compliments on my eyeshadow in my
palette video this was what I was the
main color of what I was wearing really
really super fun to play with now two
mascaras on this benefit they're real I
have an open jet because I'm waiting to
do a comparison with this and the rocket
I'm working on that that's in the works
it's coming up soon make sure you
subscribe subscribe so you don't miss
that diorshow maximizing lump lump do
your show Maximizer lash plumping serum
there's the wand okay if you've never
used the lash primer lash primers their
purpose is to go on your lashes make
them long then you put the mascara on
over top so that you get kind of twice
the volume this definitely does just I
do not like this as much as the Lancome
CIL's booster and that's about five
dollars cheaper than this one I probably
won't be repurchasing this I will
probably get the land come instead does
it work yes absolutely I don't think it
works as good as the Lancome one though
okay the last two products are lip
products the one that I'm wearing today
is my new mac lipstick that I traded in
my Vegas vote for do you bug hey coral
bliss and I love love love this lipstick
again I'm wearing it today so there is
coral bliss and I'll swatch that down
here for you I mean just the gorgeous
true coral color on the pinky side not
the orange side so you can see how it's
not painted it's not a thick thick thick
lipstick and that's what I really love
about it gives my lips a nice color
without making my lips look like
a doll or I don't know I just like a
more natural look on my lips I think a
nice bold lip looks good on other people
for me I'm just getting used to color so
this is more my style and the last thing
I want to tell you about is actually one
of my new go-to products and it is
called a great kisser by soap and glory
and this is stays in my purse and does
not come out except for I go in my purse
to get it while i'm home and this stuff
it smells like mangoes I think it's
definitely a tropical fruit pie apple ii
mango kind of smell so you can see it's
just completely clear what i love about
this especially compared to let's say a
an EOS lip balm or some of those others
my lips do not feel addicted to this I
don't feel like I need it all the time
like it's on the edge of lip gloss it's
like in the middle between lip gloss and
lip balm and it just smells good it's
it's just uh I love the way it feels and
just you get so much product in it this
is a is that say 18 grams holy cannoli
this is an 18 Graham little tub here
