it is actually a very powerful laser
that is going to permanently remove my
hair or so they said hello my friends
welcome to my first impression of the
tria hair removal system I have it right
here this was sent to me by tria so I
could try it out and let y'all know what
I think of it now this is the thing I'm
not gonna be able to give a full review
today it's just gonna be a first
impression and a couple of months after
I've been using this thing I'm gonna
come back and give you guys a full
review on whether it works or not so
today is gonna be all about what this
thing is who it's for what it does and
my first impression of using it so first
thing is this is a permanent hair
removal system it's the same kind of
system that they use in doctors offices
to remove hair but they've made it so
that people can do it at home so I'm
really excited about this the big kicker
on this is this thing is super duper
uber expensive like 400 bucks but it's a
lot more expensive to have it done at
the doctor's office so it's a good
alternative if you're planning on going
to the doctor's office to get permanent
hair removal this may be something that
you might want to look into but we have
to see whether it works or not first the
other thing is big huge rub is that it's
not for people of medium to deeper skin
tones supposedly it will burn your skin
it is not good for you I can't even put
it over like I have a black tattoo on my
ankle I can't use it on that because
it'll it can burn my skin so it actually
has a sensor on the bottom that senses
your skin tone so you it won't even work
on someone of a deeper skin tone the
other thing is it doesn't remove blonde
hair or red hair it has to be dark hair
so you have to be a lighter skinned
person with dark hair in order to use it
so that knocks out like 50% of the
people watching this so sorry I'm really
sorry about that maybe even more than
50% but you may want to see me torture
myself with this which may also be kind
of fun the box looks like this it's
super cute it's very easy to hold and
handle
it's kind of heavy I was it weighs a
good couple of pounds but it's not
obnoxiously heavy and this is the tria
hair removal laser 4x professional
technology for permanent results the
only fda cleared hair removal laser
technology available for home use it
contains the tria the power supply
instructions and a QuickStart guide what
really made me nervous is they also set
me the smooth start calming gels
why do I need to be cold for this is it
start every treatment forever fresh and
calming gel especially 4,000,000
formulated for laser treated skin Indian
plant extracts helps soothe even
sensitive skin and help keep skin cool
calm and comfortable so yeah I'm a
little nervous about that so what I
decided I was gonna do is I am NOT going
to apply this at first because I want to
show you what it's like without this
because I don't think this comes with it
so I want to be able to tell you whether
this is worth a purchase or not so I'm
gonna set this over to the side and
we're gonna try it before that now in
order to prepare for this I've read the
instruction manual I have the Quick
Start Guide and yeah I think I'm ready
for this the first thing you need to do
is you need to shave your legs wash them
dry um and then the next thing you do is
you turn it on and it's got a little
sensor there and it says that it's
locked and then it's got the little
battery it says it's charged now the way
you unlock it is there's this red light
on the bottom and you put it I'm gonna
do my leg
so I'm gonna put it over top of my leg
and hold it there done we're ready to
remove our hair and possibly be in a
great amount of pain okay so now I'm
supposed to set the treatment level it
goes from 1 to 5 1 being the least
intense 5 being the most intense and in
the QuickStart guide it says to set it
for the highest level that you can
tolerate hold for two beeps touch and
hold the treatment window to the skin
until you hear two beeps after the two
beeps have sounded lift the laser and
place it back on the skin so it overlaps
the previous spot so you're supposed to
like if you think about I'm thinking
teacher wise a Venn diagram
you're supposed to overlap overlap
overlap now if you look at this
teeny-tiny little circle and you think
about how much hair I got on my leg
that's gonna take a really long time to
remove all of this hairs who maybe I
might want to start watching a movie or
something cuz this gon be a while
you ready to do this thing let's do this
thing all right I'm gonna tilt the
camera down a little bit so you can see
better okay
is that better okay so we'll just treat
like up here okay you ready I'm scared
oh dude will you hold my hand will they
do this okay I guess I just put it on
there huh okay level one
I was anti-climactic
I didn't feel anything I don't feel
anything I feel absolutely nothing all
right
let's bump this baby up level two I
still don't feel anything nothing is it
gonna explode on me I think it said it's
okay for the fan to come on and the
directions alright I couldn't feel
anything again so let's try level three
alright level three oh I felt a little
zing
I still don't really feel much maybe
it's because of the place I'm doing it
let's try it like someplace a little
more sensitive let's try like I'm gonna
put it like right here on my leg right
there oh I felt that one I felt that one
oh dude see that hurts that doesn't feel
good all right let's bump that down
no let's bump it up cuz I want to see
how bad it gets I'm just I'm like
steve-o right now
all right let's bump it up to four I
want to see what it feels like ow
jeez Louise they described it as like a
um I know my head's chopped up I'll come
down here we'll hang out down here they
describe it as like a rubber band being
flicked against your skin I feel like
it's more of like a shocking feeling
than a rubber bands being flicked
against your skin and it's in a smaller
area
should I try five should I try five
let's try five so I wouldn't know what
it feels like all right here we go that
wasn't bad I wasn't as I felt like four
was worse yeah it's just oh she's sweet
all right not every time you do it does
it have the same level of intensity of
pain like it seems like it varies I
don't know why it's varying all right so
I'll probably keep it to like three will
probably be my treatment level and I'm
gonna just sit and watch television and
do this but that's kind of let me let me
put the camera up so I'm not like all
Hunchback of Notre Dame over here oh you
know what I wanted to do I want to try
the calming gel okay here I'm gonna put
the calming gel on and see if it makes a
difference as far as the pain level play
clean shaven skin before laser treatment
after treatment remove excess gel from
skin and clean laser with a dry cloth
okay so I'm just gonna put it on my
ankle like in the inside of my leg where
it was the most painful I'm not gonna
put it all over I'm just gonna put it in
one spot it feels cool feels cool to the
touch like it feels like almost like a
toothpaste kind of cold okay so I'm
gonna put level 1 didn't feel anything
Oh a little bit I just feel a tiny tiny
bit
okay that one wasn't so bad I have it on
level three and that's not so terrible
where's lasering myself with this
beautifully purple machine my husband
just walked in he's like what are you
doing I'm gonna try it you want lazy
yourself it's not evil it's purple how
could it be evil when it's beautifully
lavender cuz it comes like a nail gun
well you're a tattoo artist you want to
try this well you want to compare it to
like how tattoos feel come here come sit
come sit I'll stand over here come sit
no don't be scared this is my husband
John if you've never met him this is
John alright you ready
alright we're gonna start with level one

removes your hair here come on don't be
a wimp

here's level two ready it's gonna hurt I
don't know Oh level two you wimp
a little pimp all right let's do level
three you ready here we go
I'm not going well for I'm sweating
you're gonna mess up my face with this
thing you know how does it feel compared
to a tattoo it doesn't really hurt it's
just surprising you know speared yeah
all right you ready for the maximum
level yes all right here we go
ready Oh every turning yeah did you get
level 5 did you feel it yeah you did
okay all right there's just like a hot
pinprick but it's nothing that being
tattooed know the heart I think the the
main difference between like getting all
of this mm-hmm as you know like what
you're expecting that's constant you
know with this like well I guess if I
was doing it to myself ya know like when
do expect it but I'm just like but it's
really it doesn't hurt that bad yeah
like I've heard lasers described as like
a rubber band snapping yeah but it
doesn't really feel like a snap as much
as it just kind of feels like a like a
warm feels like electricity to me just a
warm kind of poking foundation you've
gotten wax before your eyebrows and
stuff wax before how would you compare
the pain to like getting your eyebrows
waxed well it's not like a it's not like
a ripping like right sensation like
waxing yeah like level of pain but not
more painful don't you think what this
no waxing yeah probably
well yeah well I mean waxing is
different the only thing I've ever had
wax is my eyebrows and they like then
you started like crying mm-hmm
y'all know about that y'all know about
that yeah well thank you for being my
guinea pig I appreciate it twice next
time I walk in when I just did a
treatment on my entire leg I just did
one leg so I decided I'm just going to
review it based on my right leg cuz that
was the one I was playing with as we
were filming and I'm gonna leave my left
leg alone so we can do a little
comparison of with treatment and without
treatment now a couple things
after treating my leg for about half an
hour one thing that's really cool is
that it has a counter up there so as you
use it it the counter goes up so it
tells you when you've gotten to the
number of beeps that you need so I
needed 600 beeps for my leg for my
entire leg so watch it once it hit 600 I
knew I was done I found it very
difficult to know exactly where I had
been because there's no markings the
hair doesn't immediately fall out I can
still see lots of hair on my leg because
it's not supposed to fall out
immediately so it was hard to keep track
of what I had done what I hadn't done
but I would imagine at the second
treatment in two weeks I'll be able to
see kind of what needs to be treated and
what doesn't need to be treated it'll be
a little bit easier I ended up on level
2 level 3 was just too painful for
repeated exposure so I ended up on level
2 it wasn't bad I could feel it every
once in a while but it wasn't
uncomfortable I think level 2 is where I
needed to be I'm hoping that the next
treatment I'll be able to go up to level
3 and then so forth be able to keep
bumping it up just a little bit so that
I can get more effect we'll check back
in like late October early November and
I'll let you know how it's going we'll
kind of compare the two legs and see
which one to see if it's really working
see if it's going well so make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss that and
Matt love to you and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
