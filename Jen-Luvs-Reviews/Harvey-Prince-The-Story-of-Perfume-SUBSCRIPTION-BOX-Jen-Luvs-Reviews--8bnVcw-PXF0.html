the brand-new Harvey Prince organics
subscription box I am really excited to
bring this to you now I do want to tell
you right away that this is a sponsored
video but I agreed to do this sponsor
video on the condition that it is going
to be an honest review I always say it's
going to be an honest review to anybody
that wants to sponsor any of my videos
so just so you know this isn't gonna be
any different even though it's sponsored
I'm still me and I'm not changing
anything so I'm gonna tell you the good
things and the things and would change
about the subscription boxes so far so
the first thing is it's called the story
of perfume it is $22 a month you can buy
a month a month you can buy a three
month subscription or six month
subscription any of those options it's
$22 a month but if you get a year then
you get two boxes for free you get this
little card inside and it just says
thank you for subscribing to the story
perfume by Harvey Prince organics your
box contains luxury fragrance is
inspired by Harvey's travels samples of
our best-selling back hair and body
products we hope the story of perfume
and chance dazzles and delights you all
of their products that they make are
100% cruelty free vegan and gluten free
so those things are important to you
this may be a subscription for you the
box is very very nice it's very very
sturdy it comes with this very cute
Harvey Prince paper and then when you
open it up it looks nothing like it
looks right now because it completely
wrecked the inside I've been I've been
playing in it you know because I want to
give a review not just unboxing but it
came with two rollerball perfumes and
these are of a seven milliliter size it
also came with two of these this is the
Hello body cream and it's a deluxe
sample and then a holo exfoliating
shower gel can I get that out yes it
also came with two perfume vials this
one here this one is called perfume ISTA
and it says the notes on this are south
african freesia japanese or an orange
flower and moroccan rose with hints of
spicy indonesian clove bud trickle in
while deep and intriguing Australian
sandalwood
passion and creativity so there's some
other things in here I will leave all
the notes down below all of these
perfumes I just dropped it or perfume
dropping things everywhere okay so all
of these perfumes I can honestly say I
enjoy but for different reasons we're
gonna spray them in different places on
my skin so that I can give you a full
scented review of them so this one I
smell the sweet right off the bat I
definitely smell the oranges but it's
it's definitely mixed with some floral
II sense it smells very nice and light
on the skin one thing that I have
noticed about these perfume is the
lasting power is pretty typical for a
perfume my perfumes lasts me maybe a
couple of hours before I need to spritz
on again I don't know if they last
longer for you but for me they don't
last super long but they're travel-size
take them with you spray them on again
no biggie right so I still smell the
same thing now that it's dried down just
a lot of orange and sweetness and I
definitely smell the sandalwood in there
I don't smell any kind of anything that
smells like clove to me I just smell a
little bit of rose but it smells very
nice I don't know what African free just
smells like but I'm assuming that's in
there as well but that one smells very
nice this is the other one why are
things falling everywhere oh okay this
is the other one this one is called
Ballon dough this is the other like
little spray thing it says spanish
mandarin moroccan rose japanese orange
flower indian jasmine australian
sandalwood madagascar vanilla clean musk
and dry woods are the notes here and
i'ma spray that on the other side I know
they're better ways to test perfumes but
I've tried them all I just want to get
like a fresh you know so I can tell you
what it smells like on my skin and of
course perfume smell different on
different people depending on your body
chemistry but overall they smell
relatively the same so this one smells a
little more perfume e to me a little bit
more alcohol before it dries down
I don't smell as much orange in this one
as I smelled and the other one this one
smells a little more floral to me I mean
it's got a nice scent this one's a
little more girly for me I got it C just
C
girly like more feminine where the other
one was a little more a little warmer
this one's a little a little lighter of
course it's falling out this one's a
little bit lighter but I do enjoy both
sets very much and then the two roller
balls that they gave are this one is
called damn more at this one I've worn a
lot I'm just gonna put it on right here
and initial sets is it just smells like
a like a crisp clean but a nighttime
scent and I did get the notes on this I
had them email them to me because I
really wanted to know what it was it's
Italian bergamot Cypress oil pink
grapefruit lily jasmine cyclamen I don't
know what that is blonde woods vanilla
patchouli vetiver tonka bean sandalwood
and musk and I think what I smell the
most is the pink grapefruit and the lily
it's much more floral and definitely
smells like an outdoorsy like a very
spring kind of scent it's very nice but
it's very romantic too
I can see someone wearing this during
the day as well as night and then the
last one is called baka may be a CI am I
I'm not a hundred percent sure how
that's pronounced so this means kiss me
in Italian is what this means so I don't
know how to say it but it's BAC I am I
ooh can I play an audio that's not the
audio I wanted I wanted this this audio
can I play the audio for the no okay I'm
trying to Google how to how to say this
but I don't know how to say it and this
one automatically smells like fruit to
me like it smells like crisp clean
fruits fresh lemon tangy cassis ripe
pineapple Talia Lily jasmine brown sugar
sandalwood vanilla and musk and that is
exactly what this smells like I
definitely smell the lemon and the
pineapple I'm not sure what cassis
smells like and I smell a little bit of
the vanilla and musk that's kind of
what's coming off mostly for me but it
smells amazing I mean really imagine the
lemon and the pineapple being dominant
with a little bit of floral thrown in
but really lemony and pineappley so
Harvey Prince polo is like the classic
Harvey Prince perfume okay so the notes
on Harvey prints below which is the two
body products is
an energizing mix of citrus top notes of
Meyer lemon and Satsuma mandarin and
floral notes summer summer forsythia and
pink plumeria traditionally found in
Hawaiian leis that will keep you
optimistic even when you're on the wrong
side of the bed hello is very famous for
being awesome and a lot of people really
love hello I actually first heard about
it on eleventhgorgeous channel they were
doing box openings I think and they had
said oh it's another RV Prince perfume
something or another unlike oh but it's
hello it's really good I remember that
that was the first time I'd ever heard a
farty Prince and then when I first got
my first hello I was like yes I love
this so I mean if you like that fruity
floral Ness
you'll probably really love Harvey
Prince perfumes now this is the clincher
this is what I was seeing is the big
flaw with this in that number one if
you're not a big perfume fan this
probably isn't going to be for you
number two you have to really like
Harvey Prince perfumes so what I would
personally do and they main get upset
with me for saying this but what I would
personally do is subscribe for one month
see if you like it and then go from
there then do your three month or six
month or a year from there if you like
it I do feel like it's a very good deal
for $22 I mean you get a lot of stuff I
feel like these roller balls are worth
the twenty like twenty bucks on their
own just because I would I would pay ten
dollars for each of these and then these
two maybe two or three dollars each and
then those samples of course are worth
not very much so I mean is it worth a
lot more than twenty two dollars no but
is $22 a fair price I think so
absolutely so if you're not sure if
you're going to enjoy Harvey Prince
perfumes I actually have a code for you
it's capital kiss me kis SME and you can
get a free mini roller those two mini
rollers that I have of the basa main one
the one that was like the lemon and the
Mandarin and then the deal more you get
one or the other which is the floral one
and you just pay shipping so you do one
per transaction so if you wanted to get
both you would have to pay shipping
twice but for one you just pay shipping
I'm not sure how much shipping is if you
sign up for the subscription I do not
get any cut from it there's no referral
system there's no affiliate program
there's nothing it's just you just get
it so they may do one of
future but right now they're not doing
us you don't feel like I'm making a ton
of money off of you signing up because
that's just totally up to you and then
they do ship internationally so if you
were an international viewer outside of
the United States they do ship
internationally but there is an
additional cost you know for for
shipping internationally but you can
check out their website for more details
on that
so I'm very excited about this
subscription I think that it's a great
deal for twenty two dollars if you like
perfume and specifically if you like
Harvey Prince perfumes I think it's
fantastic so again my recommendation is
to go where your comfort zone is if you
don't like perfumes this isn't for you
if you're not sure maybe consider
getting one of those roller balls for
shipping costs or just a one month and
see how you like it and then kind of
take it from there that's kind of my
suggestion if you know you love Harvey
Prince then take it wherever your heart
leads you girlfriend Oh boyfriend so I
