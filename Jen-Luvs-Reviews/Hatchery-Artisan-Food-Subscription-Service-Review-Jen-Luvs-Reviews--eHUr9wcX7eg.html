for you I shot this video and now the
majority of the video i cannot get off
of my camera it's like stuck on there
there's a file error so unfortunately i
can't open the box truly for you and
show my first impressions and it really
sucks because it was really interesting
first impressions but what I can I can
just tell you it's going to be faster
video this way I can tell you that I
wanted to show you my hatchery box this
is how it looks on the front and it is a
subscription service its twenty dollars
a month according to their website the
press release they gave me said is
twenty-five dollars a month so go on and
check and see what they're seeing on
there right now maybe it changes yet six
artisan like homemade like they try to
find like that like locally sourced a
really good food for you to try from
like small independent companies which i
think is really really cool where small
business owners in my family and to see
small businesses grow just make me happy
especially ones that use good solid
ingredients so and after opening it
because i have opened it i am really
excited about the products that are
inside and if you are a foodie like we
are you'll probably like this
subscription service so let me just show
you what we got inside like everything
was wrapped up like really pretty like
this in this little paper and it had
like this little hatchery sticker on it
was so cute it looked like a little farm
you know and it's got these like farm
hey looking worms in here and it's just
so cute the way they have it wrapped if
i can find a picture i'll insert a
picture right there for you of what it
looks like all wrapped up and beautiful
but let me show you the first product
that i opened and it is the big island
bees organic hawaiian honey and this
stuff is so good this is like a real
super real awesome honey one thing they
do include in here is little tasting
spoons i have used them all so i'm not
going to go through it
but I will tell you this is some
delicious like real honey we were out
we're at IMATS and we stop by one of the
rest stops and of course all i have is
fast food we don't eat a whole lot of
fast food in our family but when i do
eat fast food i really like Popeyes even
though I know it's terrible but I love
putting their honey on my biscuits and i
was eating honey i was like something is
up with this honey and i looked at the
ingredients and it was like honey and
corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup
and sugar and you know all kinds of
weird sounds like no one of this stuff
tastes weird it's only half honey if
that so this is like the real stuff it's
nice and thick look you can't I mean but
it's really sweet and really good and
just tastes like good wholesome young
amazingness so very excited about this
really enjoy the flavor of it this one
here was the second one that I opened
and this is the strawberry chipotle
flavored jam and this is by a company
called pot liquor jam and it is a little
bit spicy it's like got that sweet and
spicy it does have some little chunks in
there but not big chunks of jam and it
is really really good if you like that
sweet and spicy i'm not a huge spicy fan
I don't really like things they're super
spicy but I can handle this it's not too
crazy i would have compared it to like
mild chicken wings a sense of hotness of
course it tastes nothing like chicken
wings it tastes like strawberry jam with
some spice in it next up i opened up
this laughs fundador de sousa and fuel
and this is really really spicy i want
to ever compare this to like a hot wing
kind of a level of spices not like an
atomic spy swear if you really like that
spicy stuff this will probably be
perfectly normal for you it does have a
really nice tomatoey flavor to it but
there's some complexities in there that
i can't quite place it does have some
red pepper flakes in here so if you
don't like that dry red pepper floating
around which I'm kind of on the fence
about just because it's kind of papery
to have those little red pepper flakes
in there but if you don't like that you
probably won't like this but if you
don't mind that the flavor of this was
really really nice very complex tomatoey
kind of flavor now it doesn't have
really big chunks and if you like
super chunky salsa this isn't going to
be for you maybe they have a different
flavor that she would enjoy more but I
did really enjoy the taste of this I
probably won't eat any more but though
because it is too spicy for me I will
pass this on to my husband next up I
open up the callow virgin jalapeno
garlic olive oil and I just smelled this
I didn't taste it because I don't enjoy
just drinking olive oil but it smells
like the mate way you would imagine it
would smell it's got that strong olive
oil smell and it does have a you can
smell that garlic in it so looking
forward to using this for cooking and
this one is made in California the next
thing that I opened was the old man's
sprinkled a spice rub and seasoning made
special by jyoti and this smells very
tex-mex it smells like will be really
good on ground beef or ground turkey it
just has that cumin really really strong
human flavor it doesn't release it just
says spices with natural color salt
sugar brown sugar or dehydrated garlic
onion paprika sea salt mounts and
dextran which i think is a preservative
distilled vinegar molasses corn syrup
caramel color tamarind natural lemon
flavors and then some anti-caking agents
so a lot of really natural good stuff in
here I can I'm going to pass this on to
my husband because he really loves these
flavors and he will cook up some ground
beef for lunch and then you know bring
it with him to work so we will I will
pass that on to him the last thing that
I opened was the sweet and smoky
barbecue sauce this stuff is amazing
like it has the best flavor but I'm
actually going to cut to the real
unboxing video now because I do have the
footage from this on so here comes the
true unboxing right now I treeset me
happiness in a bottle that was really
nice of them thank you so much hatchery
cake Ozzy's BBQ sauce BBQ souls since
1985 causee foods dust come true
southern experience that's cool you know
some people they're known for their BBQ
definitely was a little watery at first
I'm gonna shake it up mmm smells like
sugar I'm going to use the back of the
spoon
it's a little gelatinous I think that's
definitely going to need the shaking
experience oh my gosh i'm a huge
barbecue sauce fan that is really good
like my mouth is watering like my mouth
wants more of this maybe i'll just take
the spoon and just eat this or drink it
whoa oh that could possibly be one of
the best barbecue sauces I have ever
tasted in my life that is really good I
don't know what it is it's just a good
match of the sweet and the smoky like
it's just it's not too smoky sometimes
when it says smoky it tastes like
smoking I don't want to eat smoke
there's a reason why smoke is not a food
so you know I'm it's a really nice
balance oh that's good this is going to
be gone cold Rick I'm gonna have to
check out that website and see if I can
get more of that I'll try it on my food
first and then we'll see whew that's
good one thing i love i really do love
without this is the little book that
comes with it the pot liquor kitchen
with the strawberry jam the pasar el
berry chipotle jam cause these barbecue
is so cute I mean the sweet and smoky
barbecue sauce I mean it's got the
little guy up here like it's like that's
the guy that made my barbecue sauce like
wasn't that nice of him and then in Big
Island B's look at those nice people
like it makes me want to buy from them
they just look so happy and Cal Cal a
virgin just cracks me up I just that
words I don't know but that's just I
mean it's so cute I mean just to be able
to meet the people that make the food
and then here on the back of these
companies old man there he is oh look
how funny he is look at oh man look how
cute he is he's adorable with his little
mac he's so cute and then luns the fund
the daughter right there oh my gosh
that's just so fun to see who made the
food I love it all right so let us recap
what hatchery sent us for twenty dollars
per month they sent us a amazing amazing
honey really really good there they sent
us some spicy strawberry chipotle jam
they sent us some very spicy love fonda
Dora celsa Fragel which will be passed
to my husband they said
some jalapeño garlic olive oil and they
sent us some oh man spice rub call
sprinkle debt and that will be passed
along to my husband as well and some
amazing Casey's barbecue sauce really
good just a reminder that just because
this is sent to me for promotional
purposes which this was does not mean I
am dishonest in any way if you saw my
last video last couple of videos yeah
last couple of videos for things that
were sent to me you will know that I
give you my impression regardless and
companies you're cool with that because
I tell them ahead of time that I'm going
to be honest so these are my honest
impressions of hatchery depending on
whether you like this kind of stuff or
not hatchery may or may not be a good
subscription for you I think this is a
good subscription for me and my family I
feel like this is worth twenty dollars
to have this experience I don't know the
value of everything in here because I
haven't had time to calculate anything
yet but I feel like this would be fun
for me for my family for twenty dollars
a month I would say that this one is a
win in my opinion I'm really happy with
it and it was fun to open and fun to try
so thank you so much to hatchery for
sending me this box and thank you so
much for watching if you enjoyed this
