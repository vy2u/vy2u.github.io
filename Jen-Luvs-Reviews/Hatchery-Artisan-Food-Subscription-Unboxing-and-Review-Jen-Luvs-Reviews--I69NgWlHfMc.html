unboxing I i do get these for
promotional purposes i don't think i'm
going to be getting any more after this
month just because I want to try out a
lot more boxes and I just can't do all
the boxes that I want to do and this one
isn't beauty related so i think i'm
going to stop doing hatchery after this
month i want to give you guys the boxes
that you're interested in so let me know
what you think about getting me out
opening these hash free boxes especially
after you see what's inside if this is
the first time you've seen hatchery i
will put all the information as far as
the prices and how much everything is
down in the description bar I think it's
thirty-three dollars a month and you get
all artisan like homemade you know small
businesses food items and there are
mostly like condiments and seasonings
and stuff like that one reason why I do
really like hatchery is because it does
support small businesses and being small
business owners in my family I just
really love doing that let me just go
ahead and get into what's in the
hatchery box this month this is not one
where you're going to get a huge bang
for your buck a lot of value for your
money but it is really fun to try some
unique things that you probably would
not try otherwise one other thing I like
about this is it includes this little
magazine and in here they have a recipe
and then they have little summaries of
all of the company's little pictures of
the people that made the food the little
company so you can learn a little bit
about where the food comes from which i
think is fantastic they also have a
really nice Instagram if you're if you
do Instagram I really like their their
pictures they put on there they put
recipes and all kinds of cool stuffs
snap share and win oh you could win a
kitchenaid seven cup food processor free
shipping on all full-sized versions of
the product sample up in this box use
code ship free to check that check out
to save that's cool so I don't know if
you all will be able to use this that'd
be cool if you see something cool here
and you go to the hatchery store which
is shop hatchery calm and you want to
order a full size of it and try it out
yourself then you put in ship free and
you get free shipping alright so this is
the way it comes and it's so beautifully
packaged I mean you just tell you put a
lot of love into the subscription six
products this month and that's pretty
typical ok this is Heidi salsa and it's
an
happy me on that school did they give me
tasting spoons this time they gave me
tasting spoons watching at once and I
thought that was so cool and then I
haven't gotten them since ooh that
smells good it doesn't smell like
straight salsa there's there's like an
air of freshness to it like almost like
it's got cilantro or something in there
to just kind of freshen it up it smells
really good I got to get a tasting spoon
because that sounds the smells are
really good great back ok this is the
joy and having small children is that
you know you still have baby spoons in
the house so I got myself six baby
spoons and let's go ahead and taste this
stuff because that's what I want to do I
want to know what this stuff tastes like
definitely medium but kind of spicy I'm
a spicy will but it's really good it's
got a really nice flavor this would be
this is going to be excellent on chips
and it doesn't taste like a typical
canned salsa you know like the you know
your tegu or whatever like it's got
definitely you can taste like a little
extra love in this let's say tomatoes
onions green chilli peppers cilantro
called it lime lemon juice lime juice
sea salt garlic spice and citric acid
delicious very nice good job to the
people at heidis salsa Luco foods love
it king kish five spicy ketchup they do
send a lot of spicy stuff so if you're
not into spicy stuff you may not like
the subscription because we've been
getting a good at least one or two
things that are spicy in each one I
think it's something with cooks I think
when they taste too many things their
taste buds die and then they just feel
like they got to make everything spicy
that's just my opinion there's no
scientific fact in there smells like
ketchup but it smells a little different
it smells a little sweet
that's not regular ketchup it definitely
has a sweetness to it like almost like
it's got like a brown sugar in it and I
taste something else what is that and it
definitely has some spice to it it's an
Eastern European Jewish snack food made
popular in America by Eastern European
immigrants and eaten widely by Jewish
and non-jewish people it says his catch
up though what spices getting me but it
definitely has something unique in there
that I cannot place it doesn't taste
like straight ketchup there's definitely
some seasonings in there that's mixing
it up really nice so if you like a spicy
ketchup that's definitely yums hopefully
no more spicy because my mouth is pretty
on fire right now and I need something
like their ear so I may be able to get a
glass of milk or something all right
next up okay toasted coconut white
balsamic vinegar that's cool who smells
like alcohol smell like straight up
alcohol definitely you can smell the
coconut see if i mix it up a little bit
let's shake it up a little bit it still
smells kind of alcohol it smells like
coconut coconut vodka instead of vinegar
let me look and see if they have any
suggestions of what to do with that oh
it's infused with fragrant Tahitian line
yes white balsamic vinegar from Modena
Italy gets an unheard-of edition of
toasted coconut doesn't say tile I'm
gelato with roasted pineapple gelato you
put the balsamic vinegar in gelato hmm
okay sure I'm not going to taste that
one though because it's well I guess I
could can't hurt to taste a little bit
right mmm all right oh it comes out like
an oil whoo oh I'm so glad I tasted that
oh my gosh that is good it's got a
coconut flavor but it's not like a like
a you know a lot of coconut stuff like
artificial coconut stuff they taste like
suntan lotion this is not taste like
suntan lotion this tastes like straight
up coconutty goodness it's got a little
bit of a zing to it was got the lime and
then it's got the coconut flavor that is
amazing I can see now why that would be
good on gelato that is really good i'm
so glad i tasted that I was gonna
neglect it and it's so good
on moving on up to east side saudi
knocks up haha miss cow Oh Laurie salt
caramel syrup oh my goodness I saw this
on their website and I was like I really
want to try that but I am NOT trying to
buy that because it's probably really
really really bad for you and I didn't
want to invest in it because it's like
it's probably gonna be just really bad
for you but that just I've read the
description that sounded amazing oh my
gosh it smells like maple syrup but
loaded with caramel I'm gonna get whole
baby spoonful I might get a real big
spoon for this whoo oh my gosh it you
know it taste like it tastes like
Werther's original caramels but in
liquid form oh my gosh that is so good
oh my god I'm just gonna drink this just
kidding I'm not gonna run tricky but I
could I could oh that's good that'd be
really good I'm vanilla ice cream
alright next see this is just really fun
I mean I know that it's 30 some dollars
but it's one of those things if you've
got 30-some dollars to just kick around
to try some fun then this is something
that i would definitely recommend okay
this is a spice rub this is what I'm
probably not going to taste I'll just
smell it Stewart and company handcrafted
in Brooklyn specially formulated spice
rub and this is specifically for beef
and we are big hamburger eaters in our
house is pretty much the only meet my
children will consistently eat this
hamburger ooh that smells good alright
we won't get the taste in spoon because
I want to taste this just a little tiny
bit
oh my gosh they're killing me with his
bike oh oh my lord okay I need some milk
now oh my god so much better oh my gosh
that was mad mad spicy that's gonna be
passed on to the husband because there's
no way i'm putting that on my burger it
did have a nice flavor I can't I don't
even know what the flavor was because I
was so busy like trying to run and get
something to milk I don't even know what
the flavor was but I did taste nice it
just set my mouth on fire I'm telling
you there's some up with these Kooks man
they have like no taste buds left I make
everything so spicy all the time don't
they know we don't think not everybody
likes that kind of stuff holy moly one
of their wives don't have taste buds
anymore either all right and that's oh
it's another one of these it's a
Tahitian lime extra-virgin olive oil by
the same company cool I don't know if I
guess I should taste this one too
because the vinegar was so good mm-hmm
I'm just gonna taste the tiny business
cuz it is oil just good to you to be
just inanimate mm-hmm it's a wheel its
oil it's definitely got a line flavor
it's a lime flavored oil tastes good
though I'm not a big fan of just eating
oil but yeah that would be really nice
you know this would be really good as
pan frying a little bit of chicken and
put this oil over top like as I sads is
cooking just to add a little bit of that
limey flavor he really good on a salad
like maybe even nix the vinegar and
wheel onto a salad hmm i bet that's
really really good oh they're so cute
look at these cute little ladies those
cute little ladies this little lady's
cute to them I mean really that's so
awesome you know you look at pictures
like that and it's like these are people
that are following their dreams you know
what I mean like it just makes me so
happy it warms my heart let's just go
over it again real quickly I'll we got
the Heidi salsa we got the king knish
ketchup we got the oil and vinegar from
olive l's we got the Tahitian lime and
