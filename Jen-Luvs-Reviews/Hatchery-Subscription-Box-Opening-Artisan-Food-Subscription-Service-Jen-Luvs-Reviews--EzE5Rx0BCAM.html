hatchery box subscription box opening I
was not expecting to get another
hatchery box but I'm very thankful to
get one i will put the link to my first
hatchery unboxing down below it was
really fun but the problem was is that i
did not truly unbox it because i had a
file error so i'm looking forward to
actually truly unboxing this one in
front of you hatchery is a food
subscription service is twenty dollars
per month and the one I kind of learned
about this last time is that well if
you're looking to get a lot of stuff for
a little bit of money hatchery is not
the one you're looking for if you're
looking for a really fun food experience
that you'll be able to try foods and
condiments and things like that that you
would never have tried before then
hatchery is where you want to go they
look for just small little small
businesses small farms people that are
just to have a passion for something and
then they give them an opportunity to
promote their products through this
subscription and they just give you a
sample of what that company provides and
I just absolutely love that so for me I
feel like this is worth twenty dollars a
month at least the last box was but it's
not like it's a huge value over what you
would be paying the things in here were
worth about twenty dollars so you know
you get what you pay for it's not going
to be a whole lot extra at least based
in the last box but we're not to talk
about the last box anymore we're gonna
talk about this box and I am very
excited to see what we've done this
month so this is how it looks on the
inside you get a little tasting guide
and what I love about this is on the
back you do get a little recipe and this
one is maple beet ravioli with chive
butter and i am not a fan of beets but I
could probably substitute that for
something and then you also get little
summaries about all of the different
companies you get to see all of the
people that make the food and what their
companies about where they're from
they're all us-based companies
California Washington another California
the Mississippi another California and
Vermont so very excited about that and
then this is how it looks at the inside
isn't that beautiful it's almost like a
little farm with hey
worms and it's just very cute and
everything is individually packaged and
it just looks very personal so I'm just
going to go ahead and open up this one
and see what it is and this is looks
like a seasoning sample too snooty chefs
gourmet seasonings and other uppity
selections italiano day copied Capri and
it's just a little semen sample so those
are the two snooty chefs there and what
does it say about them this is the
salmon shrimp oh I guess it's just an
Italian seasoning is what I'm assuming
so that'll be cool soy free vegetarian
and not free I can't smell anything
through it and I don't want to open it
because I don't want to spill it
everywhere next product that I see like
opening up a little present maple
tonewood maple com another thing that
sound seems like it might be spittle
what is that oh it smells like maple is
that like dried maple or something tone
wood maple maple flakes hate the
wonderful qualities are rich almost
smoky one hundred percent pure maple
syrup and turn it texturally upside down
these crunchy little flakes flakes pack
a deliciously distinctive punch and live
it up an infinite number of dishes from
sweet to savory let's eat one meebo
flake mmm that'd be good you know what
that'd be really good on yours if you
may like some kind of muffins and then
sprinkle it on top and then baked them
maybe that would work mmm it just tastes
it tastes like maple syrup but like
crunchy syrup or like a wrinkle is
sprinkled on like a really like boring
healthy cereal I love heavily food but
you know those healthy cereals don't
have a lot of flavor sprinkle in this on
top give them a little bit of a punch
next we got this little looks like it's
going to be some kind of jar of some
sort and it is and it is delta blue
blueberries organic blueberry fruit
spread very nice and let's find out a
little bit about them low sugar spread
bursting with flavor high in
antioxidants and certified organic where
my tasted spoons hatchery I don't think
they gave me any tasting spoons this
time I'm sad about that mmm smells like
blueberries I'm asked to get my own
spoon got a spoon for
our kitchen mmm definitely has a
tartness to it but it tastes really nice
um it's a little bit watering maybe it
needs to be stirred but definitely has a
water enos in the top of it but very
chunky nice flavor there though very
nice and let's see what next Oh fig
California balsamic vinegar cool that'll
be nice to try on something I can't
taste that now even maybe that's why
they didn't give tasting spoons because
there isn't a whole lot you can really
taste except for the spread and you can
just pick the flakes out it just says
juicy right mission figs oak-aged in our
own California balsamic lush dark and
delicious put it on road vegetables
dandelion greens or shave zucchini with
fresh walnuts exquisite dribbled over
sea salted caramel ice cream I might
have to try that hmm all right let's see
what's next okay got another jar glizzy
owes Gliss gliss oohs aahs oohs pasta
gravy pasta gravy wonder what the
difference is between the tomato sauce
on pasta gravy smells good smells like
tomato sauce has a little bit of a spice
to it I'm gonna wash my spoon and I'll
be right back okay I washed my spoon
let's go ahead and taste this whoa-ho
Liga Jolie are they trying to send my
mouth my heart they need to put a
warning on there oh it did not smell
spicy at all but then I said in my mouth
on fire holy moly oh duh thick rich and
spicy flavor all natural premium sauce
it does have a really nice flavor to it
it's just really really spicy this is
getting passed on to my husband he will
love this this would be really just
really good just on spaghetti I can see
that very nice but just to spice it for
me Oh still feeling that oh but foods
here we go elbow foods oh they look nice
some nice little people there it says
this one pack some heat that is sure
true that is shirts for
and then last thing I have let's see
Murphy's mustard company mother lode
coarse ground mustard far from the
run-of-the-mill grainy mustard out there
this one's got a touch of brown sugar
and cinnamon for extra sass enjoy as is
our mixing the Mayo for a quick dipping
sauce vegan gluten-free soy free
peanut-free nut-free gmo-free sweet go
watch must bone again alright spoon is
washed not typically a big mustard fan I
like honey mustard regular mustard not
so much so i may or may not like this uh
not a fan but i don't like mustard and
it's also very spicy so please don't
take it personally that I don't like
this I'm not a big fan of mustard unless
it's like super sweet but if you're a
big fan of mustard and spicy this is
probably for you this is just not a
personal taste of mine sorry not a big
fan of that one who passing that on my
husband I'm sure he will like that as
well because that's just not my personal
taste so overall really happy with the
selections with hatchery once again I
don't feel like this one was quite as
packed as the last one as far as
substance we got the I'm not gonna go in
the same order but we got the blueberry
fruit spread we got the little pack of
Italian seasoning we got the maple
flakes which I'm very excited about we
got the spicy pasta gravy we got the
California balsamic vinegar and then we
got the mustard again not as not as
happy with this one as I was the last
one but it's a personal taste thing I
mean everybody has their own flavors
that they enjoy their own culture that
they grew up with and this one just
didn't hit my taste quite as much as
last time but again I do really like the
subscription if this is something that
you may be interested in I'm going to
put the link to hatchery down below you
can also just type into Google hatchery
subscription and you'll find it if you
just go to hatchery com come up with
something else you can buy oh and you
can buy any of these items at shop
hatchery com which is kind of cool that
they sell all the items on their website
as well but i will put all their
information down below even though this
was sense me for
purposes I promise you I was very honest
about everything that I tasted here
today and the subscription in general
and I don't get any kind of perks for I
don't get any referral money or anything
I wasn't paid anything to do this video
all these it was just send me this box
for promotion so I did not pay for the
box and then that I got nothing else to
do this video so i like to be very
transparent about that and just tell you
that straight up front so thank you so
much for watching if you enjoyed this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and makes you subscribe if you like to
see more videos of mine and mad love to
you and I will see you in a video very
