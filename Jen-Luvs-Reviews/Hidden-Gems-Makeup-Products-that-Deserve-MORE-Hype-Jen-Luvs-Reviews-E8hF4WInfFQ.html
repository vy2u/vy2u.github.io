about products that I love that you may
never have tried I tried for this video
to pick out products that I have tried
that are not really talked about much on
YouTube yes of course you know there's
no me a lot of people that are watching
this video that have tried one or more
of these products I'm not saying that
you personally haven't ever tried any of
them but I'm trying to say that there
are products that I don't think a lot of
people really talk about and maybe some
people don't know about someone I try to
introduce you through some products that
I love it maybe they get you something
new that if you're looking for something
maybe there's a hole in your heart where
square should be I don't know what am I
trying to say I'm trying to say that
maybe there's something you're missing
in your life and you tried this product
you try this product and this youtuber
recommended this an issue youtuber
recommended that and it's not working
for you and you just want to try
something new and different maybe
something that's less hyped up so the
way that I'm gonna do this is I just
decided that the best way to show you
how these products perform is to
actually just put them on everything on
my face I'm going to show you how I put
it on and what products I use and these
are the products that I feel like are
under hyped on YouTube and so let's go
ahead and watch that right now now let's
go ahead and talk you through some of
these products so the first one that we
have is actually from the body shop it's
called the vitamin C skin boost
packaging has changed a little bit since
I bought it I'm almost out of it but it
feels very silicone II it feels very
smooth it just feels good on the skin
and it smells like oranges which is a
bonus and it's got that whole vitamin C
thing and it just feels really really
good and it definitely makes my
foundation stay on longer when I wear
especially when we're a silicon-based
foundation it's really nice this is a
nice alternate to that this is by Oprah
it's called the silicone primer gel but
it doesn't feel like silicone at all
actually silicones the last ingredient
this is a brand new discovery for me
this is from Ulta beauty as their Demi
matte foundation o-m-g I am loving at
this foundation I was completely shocked
you know getting something from Ulta
brand you don't really hear much bottle
to brand
and you know it's like you know what I'm
talking about you don't hear much about
alte brand so you wonder you know what's
up with it is it terrible but this
foundation is really really nice I mean
it's been super hot here in Maryland
it's been in the 90s and I've been
wearing this foundation quite a bit and
it just feels fantastic on the skin it's
I guess it's a little bit on the heavier
side because it is a medium coverage
foundation but as you can see in just a
minute I'm gonna build it up to a more
full coverage foundation so that's the
just the shot of both sides you can see
what one layer of it looks like and it's
quite a big difference so we're gonna
build it up now and so I can show you
what that second layer does as far as
the coverage if you have more skin that
has more flaws in it as far as
discoloration or blemishes or things you
can definitely see how that coverage
really bumps up with that second layer
so I think it makes a huge difference
it's just a really nice foundation
lasting powers really good and it just
feels good to go on nice foundation
big difference okay going into the body
a graffia essential brow trio I got this
in a subscription box if you get
subscription boxes you may have gotten
this too you probably agree with me that
it's a pretty amazing brow product I
have the one the brow powder from
Anasazi ax and I like this one so much
better it just sings straight down to
the skin it doesn't cling on to hairs in
a weird way it's really easy to spoil
out really easy to work with and I also
love that it's got the three colors and
I usually typically just use the darkest
one but it's nice to have all three if
you want some kind of variation I mean
that look at the difference holy moly
okay so now moving on to the marinus
sexy secret eyes primer definitely look
out for this on HauteLook they have this
on whole look a lot I got mine for I
think half price it was like maybe ten
ten to fifteen dollars that I got this
for plus shipping but I got a bunch of
things from Marin s at the time and it
just does a really nice job of muting
out discoloration it's a nice
alternative to the Urban Decay primer
potion and Eden works just as good this
one is a little bit liquidy err then the
urban decay one it's just a little bit
easier to move around it's not quite as
creamy this is their Urban Decay Naked 2
basics I know this is people talk about
this but I just really needed something
to balance out the shadows I'm going to
show you next and if you don't have the
Urban Decay Naked basics too
I definitely recommend it I recommend it
over the one just because the color
variation in the shades is just it's
pretty amazing all the shades are
neutral which makes it really nice for
anybody of any skin tone and there's a
nice range too so here we go The Naked
cosmetics this is the desert sunset
stack it comes with six different
shadows I'm gonna use four of them today
so this one is the number one from the
Naked stacking you can just see how
punchy it is it is so so so shimmery so
if you don't like shimmery shadows
definitely stay away from these but if
you do like highly pigmented shimmery
goodness you're really gonna like it
this one is the number three from the
set I'm just using
my outer corner just a deep and out the
outer corner a little bit again this is
very very glittery there's definite
fallout on these when you use them dry I
decided to use them dry out what's gonna
use my fix+ but I wanted you to be able
to see them if you don't have fix+
I have used them with water as well and
they work really well with water
especially packed all over the lid this
is the first time I've really used them
for a complete look I mostly use them to
pack onto the lid this one is number
four from the desert sunset and I was
trying to get like a pink on the brow
bone kind of look I kind of failed a
little bit but I don't think it looks
bad so I just decided I was gonna add
some just to make sure that pink really
showed up adds them to the lower lash
line and there's me trying to and
failing to brush off the glitter off my
face because I should have just gone
with what I know which is applying and
using water or fix+ but I really just
wanted to show you what they look like
without and I didn't expect so much
fallout it was kind of insane how much
fallout alright so I went back into my
naked chi because I really needed
something to balance it out with so I'm
using that one on the far left just to
blend out the brow bone because I just
wasn't happy with how that pink turned
out I've only ever used it on my lid
like I said so using him in the brow
bone I guess was a mistake so this one's
desert sunset number two I'm popping
that in the inner corner it's like a
very light pink it's really pretty and
then that very last very very deep brown
shade in the matte form from The Naked
basics - that's called undone it's a
really beautiful deep matte Brown it's
perfect for deepening out the crease so
that's what I'm doing here
and then once again hitting up the brow
bone because just I felt like it just
wasn't blending up there so what I
learned from this is to really use these
very well on the lid but they're a
little more difficult to work with all
above the lid on the crease or on the
brow bone
I could have edited its part out but I
wanted you to see a true representation
of what actually happened as I was
putting this stuff on so next up the
essence gel island are getting into some
less expensive prices oh my gosh the
stuff is amazing really really great gel
eyeliner if you're looking for a new gel
eyeliner goes on super black it's very
matte doesn't skip over than my fine
lines just super easy to apply even
doing a wing is relatively easy it will
mush a little bit but overall it's just
really just a nice product definitely
stays on a really long time it will rub
off if you're not careful with it as you
can see I can also put this on my lower
lash line unlike a pen liner at this the
gel liner still apply to the lower lash
line which is really nice it doesn't
last as long on the lower lash line as
it does on the upper but you know this
is another product that I feel like is
kind of talked about on YouTube but I
figured I'd mention it it's the
Maybelline push-up drama mascara I
really like this mascara the only thing
is is it does tend to clump quite a bit
so you have to really wiggle out the
clumps especially when you first get it
it's kind of wet but man does it give
really nice length and really nice
volume and I haven't had any flaking or
smudging issues with it it's just really
nice and I know it's hard to see the
dramatic effect on my lashes in a video
because my lashes just are really short
but I can see a huge difference when I
use it just gonna take my word on that
one this is the Too Faced cocoa powder
foundation I used this to beef up the
coverage on BB cream CC creams that are
a little bit on the lighter coverage
side and I was really trying to go for a
full coverage look today which I don't
normally do but I did want to show this
product to you because it's such a good
product really mattifies the face
without making it too flat and
smells like chocolate so that's a bonus
for me too it just goes on over
everything really nicely and you can see
I still have a little bit of a glow but
it's not like flat now this is the Jake
at Beauty big lip pencil in the shade
Christmas this is another less expensive
product you can get this online at Ulta
for bucks these are really nice lip
crayons they don't have any kind of
staining effect so anytime you eat you
are gonna have to reapply but they don't
bleed out of my lip line at all which is
really nice okay so this is the polished
choice and blush it on contour palette
somehow this got shoved in the back of
my drawer I don't know how because this
is a fantastic blush palette especially
for the price the blushes are really
really nice they're very buildable so
you can start off really light you know
get something very wearable or then you
can really build it up look I'm building
it up to like foam and level right now
like really bright and the lasting power
is fantastic too this is the contour
shade I love this contour it looks a
little bit warm on camera but it looks
more neutral in person and I just love
the way this contour goes on again
lasting power is really good just a very
easy product to use so I just really
enjoy it and then the highlight here the
highlight looks super bright but it's
not one that accentuates imperfections
and things even though it does look
super bright here so this is the
finished look and I don't even know what
that is that's just me being a goofball
