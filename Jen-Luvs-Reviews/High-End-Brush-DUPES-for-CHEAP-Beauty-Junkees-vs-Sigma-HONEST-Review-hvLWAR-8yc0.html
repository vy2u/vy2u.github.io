weights you see these okay I've got some
Sigma dupes for you so make sure you
stay tuned for those hello my friends
welcome to my review of beauty junkies
brushes I am incredibly excited about
this video the first reason why I'm very
excited is because I'm doing this in
collaboration with my friend Terry Lee
over at terry lee Nifty and thrifty she
is an awesome person and she was kind
enough to invite me into this
collaboration with her and I'm so
thankful to her because I got to try
these brushes and I cannot wait to show
them to you so make sure you go ahead
and click on Terry's channel so you can
see her review of these brush sets and
see how they compare your mind and get a
second opinion on them before you
purchase them if you're thinking about
maybe purchasing them I did get two of
the brush sets that they sent me for
review but as you know I do not let that
influence my review at all and as you'll
see I'm going to tell you the pros and
cons of these brush sets and let you
decide for yourself and whether there's
something that you'd be interested in I
did receive a brush set from Coastal
Scents that I'm choosing not to review
because they're very mediocre there's
nothing special about them they did
offer to give me a $100 gift card toward
their website and I'm not going to take
that because I don't feel like they're
worth showing you so but these on the
other hand these brushes are worth
showing yes wait till you see these
girlfriend weights you see these okay
I've got some Sigma dupes for you so
make sure you stay tuned for those so
this is the I brush set it's $23 ish for
the eight buy brushes the code down
there is for their Amazon site they do
have a regular website that I can get
you a code for if you really really want
it I can get it for you but they'd
rather you use the Amazon site just
because of stocking issues so I'm going
to go ahead and put that code down below
that'll get you 25% off of these brushes
if you're interested which makes them
just stupid cheap stupid cheap so we're
gonna go ahead and start off with my
least favorite brushes and we're gonna
work my way up to my favorite brushes so
the least favorite brush in here is the
flat definer brush this one is just a
very strange brush to use just
functionally for me it's just a strange
brush it is very flat I'm he trying to
use it for eyeliner but it's just too
wide I've used it a little bit for
really getting a very fine line
in the crease but I ended blending it
out anyway so this brush is just
something that I just don't really use
this style of brush so that one was kind
of a note for me it's not a bad brush
it's not super functional the only other
one that was kind of like a maybe is the
precision eyeliner brush this one I just
really prefer for eyeliner the ones that
are more pencil like they're very pointy
I just feel like it's easier to apply
eyeliner this does work if you like
angled eyeliner brushes you'll really
like this one it's very very nice it's
just you know not my preferred style of
brush for eyeliner there is a tiny bit
of a curve in there which kind of makes
it easier to hug on your lid so it mean
it's very nice it's very stiff like it
should be as a liner brush and it works
very well it's just not my preferred
style of brush for I like this one here
is very ordinary you probably already
have this brush in your collection is
the pro all over shader brush it's just
used for packing color on to the lid and
it's just a very ordinary brush you can
probably get a similar brush that works
similarly from ELF or someplace really
cheap and I'll do pretty much the same
thing but if you don't have a brush like
this in your collection you need one
because this is like essential for a
packing color onto the lid and a very
quick effective way so it's a great
brush it's just ordinary you know but I
don't think this brush set what it can
it complete without a brush like we did
this one this one is for the crease this
is called the angled shading brush at
least that's what I use it for is in the
crease it is angled so when you put it
up into the crease it really gets color
right up in there and it just feels
really good and it just puts it in there
really nicely it's got a little bit
tapered down so it picks up a lot of
product and it's just a very very nice
brush I really like it a lot
getting into the amazing brushes this is
a good brush and now we're getting into
the amazing ones the ones that I have
Sigma dupes for do ish ones this is a
dupe ish this is the pro blending and
then this is the blending by Sigma the
e25 brush that you see in every makeup
tutorial with it involved Sigma brushes
they essentially do the same thing
they're not dupes the taper on the
beauty junkies one goes down just a
little bit further it's a little bit
pointy err the beauty junkies one but
they essentially do the same thing
that's how they look side-by-side and
they're just they're just good brushes I
mean both of them are good brushes and
don't see any reason to own the e25 if
you have this one they do pretty much
the same thing the product picks up the
same blends out the same another one
that is the same is the pro taper to
blending and this is compared to the
Sigma e-40 brush so this one is the
beauty junkies this is the Sigma and you
can see the Sigma is more cone shaped
where the beauty junkies is more dome
shaped but they're both just as fluffy
they both do exactly the same thing
there again there's no reason to have
the e-40 if you have this one they do
the same thing if I had to put them
right next to each other on my cheek I
would say that the taper blending is
just the tiny bit softer from the Sigma
but just the tiniest tiniest bit they
perform exactly the same all right
another one that I have a dupe for is
the pro pencil brush this is a dupe for
the Sigma e30 brush you can see they're
pretty much exactly the same they do the
same thing here is the Wayne Goss number
20 brush do it does the same thing this
one is the only complaint about this one
it is a bit scratching when you put it
up on your in there there's there's
definite scratchiness to it so if you
have sensitive eyelids you will not like
this brush because there is some scratch
to it compared to the Sigma one but if
you can get past the scratchiness it
does the same thing as the Sigma the
other one that I really like but I don't
have a dupe for is the pro crease brush
this is very nice for getting a fluffy
look out up into your crease something
that you don't want to be super defined
it just straight up just blends it out
like it's so much less work I was
getting ready on periscope using these
brushes and everybody is like oh my gosh
that's going on so quickly and so easily
and it was like yes go pro crease brush
like it was really excited about it so
this is a really really fun brush to use
and it's just very effective very soft
and wonderful and I'm really really
enjoying this brush set I think it's
definitely worth 25 bucks 23 dollars
alright I think it's less than $20 if
you use the discount code it says on the
on the Amazon it
I make up brushes with free case
includes eight must have a shadow and
eyeliner brush set and the picture it
looks like this that's it right there
and the price on Amazon is twenty three
dollars and seventy two says the next
kit that they sent me is called the
premium contouring and highlighting five
piece synthetic makeup brush set with
blending and sponge and that's what it
looks like on the website and it is
$24.97 plus free shipping on orders over
$49 so let me show you what came in this
set again starting with my least
favorite all the way to my favorite my
least favorite one in here is the pro
duo fiber I just have trouble finding
products that are effective with this in
order to have an effective product with
this it has to be a very pigmented
product because it is just so fluffy I
have used this for press powders I have
used it for mineral powders I find that
it look works better with mineral
powders I find that works really nicely
with a nice airbrush finish with a very
pigmented blush or bronzer it's very
nice for that but it's just it's not
very versatile you can't just pick this
up and use this with any product it has
to be a certain type of product in order
for it to be effective so just be aware
of that the next one I want to talk to
you about is one that I'm not quite sure
what happened to this this is the beauty
spot this is a Beauty Blender and then
this is the beauty junkies one it's got
the same shape as the it's got the same
shape as the Real Techniques one but
it's got the same give as the Beauty
Blender like it's got the same feeling
as a Beauty Blender it may be just a tad
more dense than the Beauty Blender but I
have to like really focus in order to
feel it maybe just a tad more dense but
overall pretty much does the same thing
I do want to show you though that it is
tearing a bit you can see that tear
right there there's also a few tears in
here that it's tearing a bit now I do
want to tell you though the day before I
noticed the tear I had given this to my
son because he wanted to hold it and
squeeze it so I don't know if he acted
picked at something and created this
this may not be the sponges fault um but
I doubt I don't think that he did those
right there so this may not be a product
that lasts a really long time maybe I
got a bum line maybe I was just rough
with that I don't know but yeah it
effectiveness was great but I'm
concerned about the tearing of it and
the durability of this product so oh god
is that because I was left I was so
excited to give you a rave review and
then it started tearing but again my son
may have been involved my four year old
so I don't know I don't know about that
but I wanted to make you aware of it you
know because I got to be honest with you
hey these brushes I'm very excited about
this one is me pro detailer I honestly
just been using this for eyeshadow it's
great for packing on color it's even
great for getting color up into the
crease for getting it up there it's not
good for blending but it's good for
getting color up into the crease you can
use this to give you a little Cupid's
bow highlight you can use it for
detailing down the nose things like that
but honestly I've been using a FRA
shadow and I like it
these two are lots of brushes if nothing
else these are the two you should get it
for mostly well we'll save this one for
last as this one's super cool but this
one I've used it for contouring and the
reason why I like this is because it
picks up so much product it picks it up
on both sides and when you go to contour
it puts just a very blended out contour
already and then as you can go either
way and blend it up this way or you know
if you have it flip the other way it
doesn't matter which way you turn it and
it just gives such a nice easy
application for bronzer just so stinkin
easy and then this one here ladies and
gentlemen Sigma tapered highlighter the
f-35 check it out bambam just I mean it
does exact same thing does the exact
same thing there's no reason for me to
have my Sigma's like I'm kind of mad
that I bought all these Sigma brushes
now cuz I purchased all these Sigma
brushes I'm
kind of mad that I purchased them
because now I have these and I don't
need must take my brushes but I mean it
is nice to have a second one in case one
like gets super dirty or whatever then
I've got it back up but only both of
whom girlfriend I don't need both of
them so BAM on this one that pro
highlighter is so money so money it's
amazing so family recommend both of
these sets they're both fantastic so one
thing I did want to mention this I have
not washed these brushes yet I did put
my discount code up on periscope maybe
last week something like that and some
of the para loves and that's what I call
people that are on periscope the join me
a periscope couple of the pair of love's
ordered them and watch them and said
there has been no shedding and I trust
them so much with their with their
opinion so if they tell me they're not
shedding I believe them but I just wanna
let you know I have not had personal
experience that because you know life
happen and then I needed to film and I
just didn't have time to wash them and
dry them before I had to film the video
so that just didn't happen but I will
put a comment down in the video
description if later on I do wash them

kind of other information that's like
that I find out later about these I will
