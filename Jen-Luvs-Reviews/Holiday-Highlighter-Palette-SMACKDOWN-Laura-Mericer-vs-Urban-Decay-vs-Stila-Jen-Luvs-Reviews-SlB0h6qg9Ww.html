just made a bad choice I think that's
what it comes down to hello my friends
welcome to my review of three of the
brand new holiday highlighter sets that
are now available at Sephora now there
are a lot of other holiday highlighters
that are available including the
hourglass one and the bobbi brown one
that look absolutely gorgeous I went to
the Sephora vib Rouge event and I picked
these three to purchase I'm gonna
nitpick these apart and let you know a
lot about them my personal opinions on
them we're gonna see some swatches and
we're also gonna do an ingredient
analysis so you know if you have a
special skin type whether these may be
especially good or especially bad for
you so first let me just show you the
ones that we're going to be talking
about today we have this Stila this is
called the starlight Starbright
highlighting palette you do get three
shades in here we have the naked
illuminated trio you get three shades in
this and a dual sided brush they both
come with a mirror both of them have a
mirror and this one comes with three
shades again and this is $36 and then
finally the Laura Mercier this is called
fall in love face illuminator collection
again comes with a mirror but this one
comes with four shades so let's go ahead
and show you the swatches now so you can
kind of see how they apply to the skin
keep in mind that arm skin is different
than face skin but because I only have
two cheeks it's kind of difficult to
show you on the face all of these
different shades so just so you know on
my face today I do have the steal one
this center shade which is called kitten
that is the highlight that I have on
today the blush I'm wearing today is
model cozy amaretto sunset I really love
their blushes they're a very underrated
brand for blushes they're very very nice
and then I have my Anasazi Beverly Hills
contour kit for contour but no other
highlight this is a matte blush so let's
go ahead and get into the swatches so
you can see how it applies to my skin
right now you have seen the swatches and
how they apply so you know when we
talked about summary as far as
application goes they really all apply
very very differently and depending on
what you personally like you may like
one versus another the steel of course
goes on very creamy it's that it's a
dimethicone base which we're going to
get into in a second so it goes on
really creamy what I personally do is I
swipe it on with my fingers and then I
stipple it out with the stippling brush
you get more pigmentation if you use
your fingertip first less if you only
use the stippling brush for this one
here this one is is a lot more powdery
of course lots and lots of glitter in
this one the way that I choose to apply
this one is I swipe it on my cheeks with
my fingers and then I blend it out with
this brush I do feel like that this one
has the most even application of the
three with a brush but then you've got
all that glitter - that you're dealing
with so it's whether you like glitter or
not and then with this one we have the
very creamy ones this one definitely in
my opinion needs to be applied with a
finger it does not apply well with a
brush at all I've tried multiple brushes
with this and I just don't feel like I
get enough pigmentation from my personal
likes if you like a more subtle
highlight you may like it with a brush
but I don't know you still get that
shine but it's just not the color
doesn't come through it's just more of a
just random shine when you when you use
a brush with it so what I'll do is I'll
apply it with my fingertips and then
I'll spread it out with like like a
buffing brush a contour brush something
like that something with more bristles
so not not a stippling brush with less
bristles with something with more
bristles like a angled contour brush let
me just show you one this is from it
cosmetics this is the chic blush brush
that comes in their chic set that's
coming out for the holidays I'm not sure
if it's quite out yet I got it at
generation Beauty but this is kind of
the density that I go for when I'm
applying the Laura Mercier highlights to
my cheeks and but like I said a lot of
times I'll just use my finger first and
then
out with this alright so let's talk
about value for a minute so the seal of
1 is $39 you get point 5 ounces that
comes out to $13 per pan and $78 per
ounce of course you don't get a full
ounce of product you only get half an
ounce of product in here so the dollars
per ounce is just for comparison
purposes when we're talking about value
of all three of these pallets but we're
talking $13 per pound of product here so
for the Urban Decay Naked illuminated
trio $36 you get about half as much
product as you get in the Stila it comes
out to $12 per pan and $150 per ounce
and the reason why it came out to less
is because it's less expensive than this
one overall so this one is the least
expensive of the pallets that I'm
showing you today this one's in the
middle as far as how much they actually
cost but if you think about dollars per
ounce this one is about twice as good of
a value with $78 per ounce versus $150
per ounce
now the by far least amount of value is
the laura mercier the laura mercier is
$58 you only get point 1 1 ounces of
product that is a little less than 1/5
of the amount of product that you get in
the Stila and it's about a little less
than a little more no yeah a little less
than a half of the urban decay so you
definitely get the least amount of
product in this one it comes out because
there's 4 pans - $14.50 per pan and $527
per ounce of product it is by far the
most expensive and by far the least
amount of product you get in here so as
far as best value the award goes to the
Stila so and then for cheapest dollars
per pan we're going with me of naked
illuminated trio overall worst value to
the laura mercier before we get into the
ingredients let me just preface this by
saying that I am NOT a chemist sometimes
I mispronounce names
it happens all of my sources will be
linked down in the description below the
big source that I use is ewg organ
Environmental Working Group they
resource research a lot of ingredients
they put all of the studies together and
a
a convenient place so we can look up and
see where I can look up and see what's
bad and what's not bad in different
products so that'll all be linked down
in the description so let's talk about
the Stila now thankfully first ela
there's only one ingredient that causes
any kind of irritation has any kind of
red flags on ewg and that's time at the
cone dimethicone is one of those things
that you either love it or you don't
love it most people that don't love it
have acne-prone skin it is a silicone
based product and basically what it does
is it gives it that slip if you feel
these they feel very very smooth when
you touch it you go whoo because it's so
smooth but then if you don't want your
pores clogged you may not want to get
this product but thankfully there isn't
a single other ingredient in this that
has any kind of problem on ewg
everything else looks fantastic moving
on the urban decay okay the urban decay
one let's see so the number one
ingredient in the urban decay one is
talc so if you know that you were
allergic to talc sensitive to talc of
course you do not want to purchase this
there's also a contamination concern for
talc when I say contamination concern
basically that just means that some
batches of talc somewhere found in some
product were contaminated with some kind
of really bad thing so does it mean that
this particular talc has anything bad in
it absolutely not
but just be aware that some talk
somewhere had a problem oh and it's
considered a high concern from
environmental working group and that
kind of contamination concern gives it a
three rating where one is not that at
all there's no harm in it to Ted being
really really really really bad
what talc had been contaminated with in
the past was asbestos fibers which is
you know if you know anything about
asbestos you know that that's not good
also of course talc can be an allergen
the next one is benzyl alcohol which
we've talked about before it's a
naturally occurring synthetic ingredient
used as a solvent and a preservative
it's been associated with contact
allergy especially with people working
in factories that use this a lot it's a
very loud the workplace exposures are
restricted for the European Union so
it's really people that are using
and touching this in a large quantity
for long periods of time there they're
not allowed to handle it so that's
totally up to you whether you think that
that's a problem or not the last one is
sorbic acid it's a naturally occurring
synthetic produced compound used as a
preservative it is an allergen so strong
evidence found by the cosmetic
ingredient review and they're based in
Washington DC so another allergen in
here so if you have sensitive skin you
may not want to get this one it has a
lot of things in here that could be bad
not a lot of things but a couple of
things in here that could be bad for
people with sensitive skin so just be
aware of that and then finally we have
the laura mercier so when we look at
this
all right so mostly really good stuff in
here
nothing bad except for one ingredient
it's called polysorbate AE and it's
listed as a 3 for environmental working
group
it's a surfactant okay so what I think
the polysorbate 80 is being used for in
this is the shine and the shimmer that
you're seeing in this it can also be
used for thickening systems reducing
irritation in the skin and improving the
stability of the formula where they have
an issue with this is that there's
different grades of polysorbate 80 that
can be purchased the lower grade is more
likely to be contaminated with really
really bad things so there's a food
grade and a non-food grade so it
depending on what polysorbate 80 they
used for this that is what would make it
be bad or not bad also I read somewhere
that's not as reliable of a source
meaning I don't know much about the
website that it can be an allergen for
some people but definitely not for
everybody just for some people so really
there's no way to know whether this is
gonna be bad for you or not because it
really just is gonna depend on what
laura mercier chose to do as far as
buying a higher-quality polysorbate 80
or a lower quality but that's what
you're kind of having to decide when you
choose to purchase this or not alright
so now getting into my personal review
my personal feelings about these pallets
if I had to pick one I would probably
it's kind of a tie between the Stila and
the warmer
let me talk about why I don't like this
one I don't like the Urban Decay Naked
eliminating trio it does not last a very
long time I do actually really like the
brush but it doesn't last a very long
time and there's so much glitter in here
it's just not to my personal tastes so
much glitter if you like a lot of
glitter and you don't care if that
glitter transfers to other places on
your face rather than where you put it
you may enjoy this but lasting power is
not fantastic for the actual color the
glitter will stay but the the tone of
the shade will fade away relatively
quickly within a few hours so this one
is actually gonna go back to the store
I'm not going to keep this I am NOT
enjoying it at all
these shoe I don't know I I'm thinking
I'm gonna keep the Stila and I'm
thinking I'm gonna return the laura
mercier because I was expecting let's go
to the laura mercier next I was
expecting the laura mercier to blow me
away it's $58 that's a lot of money
I really cannot justify keeping this for
$58 the lasting power is actually pretty
good on it it'll last me a good six
hours or so with the high light on but
there isn't enough variation in the
shades when I put them on my cheeks they
look beautiful in swatches but then when
you actually apply them to the cheeks
there really isn't a whole lot of
difference they're beautiful as far as
eyeshadows I've been really enjoying
them as eyeshadows but I don't think I
love them enough for $58 that's a lot of
money so I think this one's gonna be
going back to the store as well and I
feel bad about it because I don't enjoy
returning products every product i buy i
buy with the intention of keeping it but
i can't i can't justify a $58 price tag
so i'm assuming with their point 11
ounces and 58 dollar price tag they're
making enough money to people to cover
my return i do feel bad for sephora that
they have to eat my return but they do
have the return policy on their own
choice they have the ability to revoke
the return policy if they choose to if
they didn't feel like they could afford
the return policy i'm sure that they
would not do it i'm sure they see it as
a good business move to allow returns
that's why i choose to return we are so
off topic let's go back to the steal and
the steal a one i think is the one that
I'm going to keep I do love the way that
it feels it feels very nice I don't have
acne-prone skin I feel like the lasting
power on the Stila is my favorite I feel
like the tone you can tell the tone
difference
on the skin and I've been really
enjoying this one isn't my favorite
highlighter palette absolutely not
honestly if I were gonna pick a
highlighter palette to buy I would
probably buy an honest Oscar palette to
be honest if you want a really poppy one
or I have the original hourglass three
pan highlighter palette if you don't
want a really poppy one I would
recommend those to be honest I really
wouldn't recommend any of these unless
you want something that specifically was
released for the holidays that I would
say my personal opinion the steal is my
favorite but honestly none of them are
that great and I hate to say that like I
don't want to be negative but they're
not great they're not fabulous I wish I
got in the Bobbi Brown one now now I'm
kicking myself not getting the Bobby
Brown I wish I had not gotten this one
because when i swatched it i had a
feeling I was like you know maybe I'll
like it and I was like and and it'll be
different for a review you know that'll
be for a different I don't know I just I
don't this impulse buying okay and I
just made a bad choice I think that's
what it comes down to so I want to thank
