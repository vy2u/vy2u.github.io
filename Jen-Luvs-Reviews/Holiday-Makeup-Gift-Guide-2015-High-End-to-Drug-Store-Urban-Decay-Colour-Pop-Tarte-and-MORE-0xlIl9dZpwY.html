you
hello my friends welcome to my holiday
gift giving guide for Christmas and
Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and any holiday you
choose to celebrate this holiday season
I have so much to tell you so I'm just
going to jump right into all of my
recommendations and not recommendations
actually let's go ahead and start with
the not recommendation I think the
people are going to tell you you should
buy people and I'm telling you don't buy
it it's not good I have to specifically
that I want to share with you the first
one was one that I returned and it is by
to face and it is the Legrand palace
eyeshadow set okay I feel like what
happened with this is that two-faced
wanted to make something beautiful and
they did this thing is gorgeous it is
absolutely stunning the quality of these
eyeshadows are not up to to face
standards in my opinion what I expect
from to face to face is one of my
favorite brands of all time like if you
ask me what my favorite high-end brand
is I would probably tell you either Kat
Von D or to face like they're
consistently good this palette does not
live up to it I have heard that some of
their other holiday pallets are much
much better than this one but this one I
would say about half to a little less
than half of the shadows are not good
for me they either leave fall out there
powdery they don't blend well things
like that there's all kinds of issues
with the formulas of these shadows so my
recommendation is not to buy that the
other one that I would recommend that
you use caution before buying is the
Urban Decay vice for palette this
palette like many of the Vice pallets
has a problem in that it doesn't have an
easy way to make looks I have it upside
down so that the mirror isn't
distracting there are some gorgeous
shades in here like for example this one
right here flame is really really fun to
play with there's a lot of really fun
shadows in here but unless you have a
giant makeup collection or you are a
makeup artist or you're really good with
eyeshadows this might be a little
difficult to work with for you I know
it's difficult for me to work with and I
play with eyeshadow like that's my
part-time job is playing with aysha
and I have difficulty using this palette
some of the shades are a bit powdery
some of them are a bit difficult to work
with you are going to get glitter faced
by the end of the day I don't like to
say fallout because when i say fallout
people think an application i'm getting
fall out an application i'm not getting
fallout because what i do is i always
tap my brush off but at the end of the
day some of these glitter shadows are
going to leave sparkle on your cheeks
that doesn't bother you you're going to
be good if it does bother you you may
want to skip this one so those are the
two do not buys now I've got a bunch of
bonds to talk about different kinds of
people and what I think you should get
for them so the first thing is your
neutral color lovers and I have a few
recommendations for you two are not ones
that I've actually tried yet but they
have such great reputation I'm gonna
tell you the naked palettes okay these
are famous for a reason this one I've
used for a couple of years this one is a
brand new purchase for me I've actually
haven't even used it yet the brush is
still in here I mean I still like the
plastic isn't note the plastic is still
on the mirror I mean this is i've
swatched it a little bit but from just
watching it and from of course reviews
of it and tutorials and everything this
is a definitely definite definite win
for your neutral lovers another one is
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette this
is another new purchase for me that I
have not used yet but from
recommendations from other people this
is amazing i swatched the bit i am going
to be playing with it very very soon and
but i'm trusting in all the reviews that
i've seen as far as this being an
amazing amazing purchase for a makeup
lover in your life that likes neutral
colors you're looking for somebody
that's going to work or school that
needs record needs a makeup to wear this
is definitely gonna be a good palate the
other thing is it smells just like
chocolate so if you have a chocolate
lover this is gonna be one they're gonna
be like oh my gosh thank you so much and
they're going to hug you and love you
for buying them as palette it's amazing
at least from what I've seen from other
people using it i'm going to be honest I
haven't personally use it yet but I'm
trusting in the universe and everybody
loving that palette moving on to some
things that I've actually use this
palette here this is the rock mega pro 2
maroc mega pro 2 is going to be for the
person that it already has a makeup
collection is already used to using
eyeshadows and want some really fun
shadows to play with this palette is
also very confused as far as what it
wants to be you've got a lot of light
shades over here that are just kind of
hanging out and again there's no good
neutral transition color in this palette
but there are a lot of really fun shades
to play with they're very buttery creamy
easy to blend they do kick up a lot of
powder when you use them so you do have
to make sure you tap your brush off so
this is going to be for your experienced
makeup lover I think that they'll really
really like this a little color lover
BAM oh my gosh ladies oh my gosh this
lives up to the hype so bad so bad my
only thing i don't like about this
palette is that it slips out of the case
very very easily so you just got to be
careful of that but the ease of use of
these shadows if you've never used color
eye shadows or your friend has never
used color eye shadows and you know they
want to try it this palette is perfect
these shadows are so easy to use and
you've got some beautiful neutral
transition colors in there because you
know how important that is to me to make
it a complete palette also you can use
the black not as a black necessarily but
to deepen up other colors to make them
darker same thing with the brown you can
use that steep annabella colors you've
got a really nice highlight here this
skulls color is a shimmery white it's
absolutely gorgeous the shades in here
are phenomenal they're so fun to use
their very long wearing it's amazing
palette it's amazing palette highly
recommend this to no end like I would
recognize it's amazing all right for
your bluff lover this is a really really
nice set this is the tart holidays
there's four different shades of blush
in here and they're all gorgeous i'm
just going to open this up and show you
i did get this i will tell you i got
this with a gift card that was given to
me by tart at generation beauty it was
given to everybody that got their big
swag bag so i did not purchase this
personally but tart does not know that
i'm making this video and they are not
affiliated with me i do not benefit from
anything they just gave the gift card to
everybody and this is one of the things
i purchase with the gift card i tried to
purchase things that I thought you all
would want to see and that you would
want to know about so the shades in here
are absolutely gorgeous here's one this
one is called ecstatic this one I'm not
going to swatch them for you because
they do not swatch well but they go on
the cheeks very well this one is called
ethic there are no mirrors in here by
the way some of the big blushes well the
big blushes have mirrors these little
ones do not this
is beautiful this one is called
embellish and then this last one here is
called entertain three of them our mats
these three one two and three are Matt
this one does have a little bit of
sparkle in it but it's a very subtle
sparkle and they're just absolutely
gorgeous shades I've used all four of
them I've loved all four of them they're
all very long wearing but they do swatch
horribly but they're beautiful on the
cheeks absolutely beautiful highly
recommend this set I would recommend
this set over the blush palette because
I feel like it's easier to work with
these it's easier to pick out one blush
to use rather than an entire palette
also if there's a shape that doesn't
work for you you can give it away to a
friend it may work for better wear with
a palette you can't do that you're stuck
with all of them whether you use them or
not so this is a really really nice
option if you're a blush lover these
things are absolutely amazing and then
they sell this at Sephora jcpenney they
also sell it at tart online that's where
I got from the store online it is $35
moving on to the ton of people that want
to contour contouring is huge I don't
know if you know this but contouring
blew up this year everybody is all about
the contouring and highlighting
everywhere so I have two recommendations
for you one is high-end one is drug
store will talk about the drugstore one
first this is the elf contour palette it
is stinking amazing it is an incredible
incredible palette this is an exact
Dukes contour palette the shades in here
are wonderful I've used the stink out of
the shade the shade is so perfect it is
the perfect perfect perfect contour it's
amazing this highlight shade is also
very beautiful this bronzing shade is
beautiful here this one is a little bit
it's it's got a little bit of yellow
tinge to it so i use it sometimes as an
under eyes setting powder for me but
it's it's absolutely beautiful if you
have someone that's of a deeper skin
tone please keep in mind that this may
not work for some with a deeper skin
tone just because you want to think
about how this is going to contrast with
their skin tone so kind of keep that in
mind as a layer skin person I know this
works very well for me but if your
friend is a darker skin tone they may
not be able to work with this as much
kind of think about their skin tone
compared to this deepest color you would
want this to be deeper than their
natural skin tone that makes sense
are also see it's not going to work as
well if you have someone that is of a
deeper skin tone this may be a better
option for you but it is quite pricey in
comparison this is the Kevin tequan
contour book i actually just bought this
a couple of days at home at the vib
rouge sale this is the contour book vol
2 art of sculpting and defying I did
find this in the store you get to cream
products you get a cream sculpting you
get a cream highlight you get a powder
sculpting and a powder highlight and for
gorgeous eyeshadows I wore this for the
first time on my eyes today and I'm
telling you it lasted 12 hours it was
faded a little bit but it were it lasted
12 hours on my eyes I mean just amazing
i also use the cream contour on my
cheeks and you could still see the cream
contour the highlight was gone but you
could still see the cream contour and
the eyeshadows were still there so for
me that's very impressive and this is a
definite definite recommend from using
it this one time I am wearing it on my
eyes today and I'm wearing it as my
contour today so definitely recommend on
this one thing I also want to mention if
you are going to buy this these pallets
you can only get these on the elf
website these pallets are also amazing
this is the mad from that palette this
one is very very good the only thing
about this is the lasting power of the
shadows isn't very good the blend
ability is wonderful though the ease of
use is wonderful so if you're looking to
last through a work day this is probably
going to be fine for you and I think
these are ten dollars each I think this
is six dollars if you're looking for a
more affordable option my favorite one
of these is the need at nude palette I
do have a review of all of these pellets
with swatches so if you're interested in
this I will link that video down below
of the swatches of everything that was
elf they came out with that release I
don't have a highlighting palette that's
the only thing I didn't get but yes
highly recommending these products from
brush lover in your life brushes will
talk about brushes this is this is
another thing that I got with the part
gift card these are this is the tart
holiday brush set now this one probably
not be for your beginner this will
probably be for somebody that has makeup
Russian brushes and has been using
makeup for a while because they can be a
little tricky to deal with I will give
you some options for other brush sets
for beginners in just a moment
but that these are very very nice this
is this is very nice for foundation this
one here I'm not sure the names the
names aren't on here and I threw away
the packaging but if you go on the
support website you should be able to
find this or the tart website to find
out the actual names but i can tell you
what i use them for this one i use for
foundation this one I use for highly
pigmented blushes this one I use for
powder or i use it for powder foundation
this one I use for concealer it fits
very nicely there and this one I use for
eyeshadow so they're just it's just a
really nice high quality brush set it's
wonderful i'm going to put images here
of the next you i do own these but i
don't have them all together and looking
beautiful so i'm just going to put the
image up there these are the tumor i
would recommend for new makeup users the
first one is from Real Techniques and
it's there I brush set absolutely
amazing i brush set you have everything
you need to create gorgeous i looks with
that i did see that at Ulta today is
also available many many places online
it's a phenomenal I brush set now for
face brushes what I would recommend is
there's a company called outer beauty
it's my absolute favorite favorite brand
of brushes they are not talked about on
youtube at all but this brush set here
from outer beauty is phenomenal
absolutely no the process of washing my
brushes so this is one that did not make
it into the wash this one here this is
part of the face brush set this is
around kabuki and you can see how dense
this is I mean it's just absolutely
insane so for face brushes these are the
ones that i would recommend and they are
very reasonably priced are not super
cheap but they're reasonably priced Oh
another I brush set that's also very
good if you can find it is the Ecotools
brush set then i'm going to put here i
don't like it quite as much as the Real
Techniques one because I feel like
they're a little bit more difficult to
work with but it's also a very nice
brush set for an alternative so now
going back to drugstore pricing as far
as color pop these are my favorite color
pop liquid lipsticks aren't I boring
they actually swatch quite differently
believe it or not they look like they're
pretty much the same but they swatch
quite differently I am wearing today on
chilly chilly on my lips can you tell
that this is even the same color maybe
on the inside a little bit but this I
mean you can't even tell this is
straight-up dark brown on my lips
doesn't
like that in the tube but this is these
these liquid lipsticks I are my favorite
liquid lipsticks of all time they are I
think six bucks each highly recommend
these and if you're there pick up some
highlighters as well they're
highlighters are phenomenal absolutely
phenomenal I know there's there's
different opinions about their
eyeshadows I'm personally not the hugest
fan of their eyeshadows I like them but
I find them a little bit difficult to
work with so I'm not going to put them
in this video as they absolutely
recommend for the holidays but these are
things from colour-pop that I would
absolutely recommend their other lip
products are also wonderful their lippie
Stix if people if you have a lipstick
lover in your life not liquid lipsticks
liquid lipsticks or it can be very
drying so if you think a person won't
like that yet lippie Stix instead on the
lippy pencils if people like lip pencils
you can get those as well but as far as
the cheek products the highlights are
definitely my favorites of all of the
cheek products and the lip products the
liquid lipsticks are my favorites so I'm
not including in this video any
foundations face powders moisturizers
things like that because I feel like
those things are extremely individual to
the person also i'm not going to
recommend any mascaras i mean i could
recommend mascara should i recommend
mascaras i'll tell you a couple of
mascaras if somebody is really really
looking for mascara drugstore options
Maybelline lash sensational I heard
extreme by essence you can get this at
Ulta Jordana best live / extreme you can
get this from from walgreens and then
for high-end the Urban Decay perversion
and the roller lash another
recommendation me if you want someone
that needs a little more oomph for their
lashes that they feel like the mascaras
don't perform right on them the land
calm CIL's booster XL is a lash primer
it has white here you put this on your
lashes first and then you add your
mascara on top and it's just kind of um
it might be a novelty for some people
but I feel like it really really works
to enhance the effect of my mascara it's
wonderful I like this much better than
the do or 12 or has a very similar one
but i like this one alone i didn't
mention browse i just realized so let's
throw some browse in there i don't
you don't want to miss anything on the
it cosmetics brow power is wonderful the
Anasazi a brow Wiz is wonderful I've
heard that the Knicks one is also
fantastic and completely interchangeable
for these expensive ones you can get the
next one at Ulta as well thing I wanted
to tell you about is eyeliner my
favorite favorite favorite eyeliner
formula if you've been around you know
what it is the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliners they're absolutely amazing i
think there's seven dollars on the
Jessie's Girl website they have black
they have brown I also have the blue one
they also have a green one I mean
they're just amazing amazing quality
liquid eyeliners are not the way that
they used to be liquid eyeliners used to
have a brush tip some of them still do
to apply there a little bit more
difficult these I feel like are perfect
for beginners with eyeliner people that
aren't used to using eyeliner they don't
seep into my fine lines which is really
really nice and they're just a
phenomenal quality let me kind of show
you how these go on I mean just so easy
so easy to go on and and they're very
opaque they give a really nice line very
easy to apply compared to most liquid
eyeliners and they're just an amazing
quality the next closest I would say to
the quality of these is the Maybelline
master precise eyeliner is also very
good but the lasting power is not as
good as this this will last on your eyes
all day long you'll still have all your
eyeliner will still be on by the end of
the day it's phenomenal at least with my
normal skin that's what happens if you
have oily lids it may be a little
different for you you're looking for a
high-end option I just bought it a
couple of days ago so I've only used it
once and that was today and it is the
Marc Jacobs eyeliner i think it's called
remarkable oddly i've misplaced it even
though i use it right before i was
filming but this wing has been on since
745 this morning or eight o'clock this
morning I mean and it's still there
still there absolutely amazing now that
formula did seep into my fine lines just
a little bit so it was a little bit
harder to work with believe it or not
than these but the quality is also
amazing if you wanted a higher end one
but honestly these perform just as well
as that one in my opinion so now real
needs you did the Marc Jacobs unless you
just don't want to shop
the Jessie's Girl website that's the
only reason why I would think you would
need the Mark J so that's it for my
holiday recommendations thus far if I
get anything else I will let you know
