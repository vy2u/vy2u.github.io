the kala we test Korean beauty products
to decide whether they are worth your
money today we are going to be testing
out the Holika Holika aqua petit jelly
BB cream can't wait to show you what
this product is all about so this my
friend is the Holika Holika jelly BB
cream this was requested after I did my
cotton candy cotton BB cream by Holika
Holika well what is that the jelly one
so let's talk about the jelly one and
what's going on with that the first
thing you need to know is it only comes
in two shades light and lighter so I got
both shades so that we could try them
out and I had to keep them in the box
because it's not marked anywhere what
the shade is so this one in my hand is
number two and then the one in the box
is number one we're going to trying one
on one side my face and the other on the
other side of my face so you can see the
difference it also comes with one of
these spongy thingies which I have used
one of them the other one is clean but I
use this one so we're going to be
talking about the sponge in a minute and
whether that's helpful helpful or not so
you get one point three five ounces of
product in here which is good because
typical foundations are only one ounce
for the first shade I got both of them
off Amazon
so the first shade I paid twelve dollars
and seventy five cents and the second
shade I paid $13.75 but these prices are
going like up and down and there's
different sellers and things she may be
able to get for a little bit cheaper
depending on you know which seller and
the time you try to buy it so I'm going
to read you the description from peach
and Lily and they sell it for twenty
dollars so you might not want to get
there it says that it's a water-based BB
cream and it's a hit in Korea and it
works well for combination oily skin I
did read some reviews that said that it
was also good for dry skin it says it
has a wonderful jelly texture that helps
make up spread more evenly leaving your
skin look dewy hydrated and flawless and
has great coverage and comes in two
shades the aqua beige and the aqua
natural
so the beige is supposed to be for
cooler tone so that's the number one and
the number two is supposed to be for
warmer skin tones as you may know Korean
skincare sometimes claims to have a lot
of health benefits and the big thing
that they claim that they have in this
is mint water and the mint water is
supposed to be really good for your skin
so I looked at the ingredients because
I'm a and I do these things so the
number one ingredient is water but you
don't get to mint till like way down at
number 10 I guess it's like diffused
with the mint before they put it in here
at all now so water is the number one
ingredient and the next ingredient
believe it or not is titanium dioxide
which can be used as a sunscreen even
though this doesn't say that there's any
sunscreen benefit in here so I wouldn't
count this as a sunscreen nothing tells
me that the sunscreen except for the
titanium dioxide it can also be used as
a colorant so the third ingredient is a
mineral oil substitute and then we have
something called die potassium glycerin
is eight something like that now his
eight it's a skin conditioning anti
irritant and they say that it's good for
dry skin so I thought that was pretty
awesome then we have some things that
help with texture acrylate dimethicone
and then we have something called methyl
methacrylate cross polymer which is
supposed to absorb excess oil and sebum
from your skin so we released skin
people that's where they get that it's
recommended for you then the next
ingredient is sodium hyaluronic which is
a wonderful anti-aging ingredient so I
was really happy to see that so high up
in the ingredient list and it's right
before that meant after that we have
tons of seaweed and algae extracts I
couldn't find a lot of research on the
different extracts that they use except
for a couple of them the first one is
that I found and research on with the
macro situs pie riff Ferrara extract
part of the fun of these videos is me
trying to pronounce these names they say
that this is an L algae extract that is
an anti irritant anti aging and combat
sun damage which I thought was pretty
cool and then the next one which is the
20th ingredient is caviar extract not a
lot of research on that there was one
company that did a double-blind study
that the 35 women that they tested found
some anti-aging effects to it but we
have to take into account that
there's a company testing it even though
they do say that it was double-blind and
then there's some aloe leaf juice in
there and then we get into something
that's not so good this one is called
tri family mine it's a pH balancer that
can be an allergen for some people and
then way down at ingredients 40 and 42
we've got dumped on paraben some people
are very anti paraben some people don't
believe in the paraben hype and that the
parabens are just fine but just so you
know there's parabens in here make
whatever judgments you choose but as far
as anything else that's pretty much it
for the ingredients so we've got some
good stuff but then some also you know
the one allergen and then parabens if
you don't like parabens overall it's not
bad as long as you don't mind parabens
so at this point we are going to follow
their directions and they say that you
are supposed to take this little spatula
guy and you are supposed to Pat this
onto the skin and then you are supposed
to dab it now I did try to wet this and
if that did not work it did not absorb
any water so it was useless to wet it
like a Beauty Blender so what we're
going to do is we're going to take shade
number one and we're going to blob it on
this side of the face right right and
they say only do for around the face but
I found that to be not nearly enough it
doesn't have a mint scent it's more of a
floral kind of scent which is kind of
interesting it's actually smells quite
nice and I'm going to blend this all
over this side and then I'll show you
the coverage so this is shade one on my
face I'll show you this side and that
side and I was reading that people were
saying on makeup alley that this is
medium light to medium coverage and I'm
just not getting that on one application
I see it as being very light coverage
let's go ahead in with another coat I'll
just blah blah blah and let us Pat
I will say it blends very nicely into
the skin now with the second coat I can
see definitely building up the coverage
and it looks very nice with the second
coat so what I'm going to do now is to
show you the difference I'm going to go
ahead and put shade number two on the
other side of my face bla bla bla bla
and it's definitely got a jelly-like
consistency it's very very squishy
looking okay so there is one coat and
we'll go ahead and let that dry and then
we'll do the second coat
when I say coat it reminds me of like
nail polish or like paint on a wall
always cracks me up like in my head I'm
always like yeah just like paint the
wall
so as you can see the color difference
between my two sides of my face really
isn't dramatic between the one and the
two we've got light and we've got a
little bit lighter for number one I
forgot to mention I am not wearing any
kind of primer all I'm wearing is a
little bit of skincare when I woke up
this morning it's now quite late my
husband and I went out to brunch and we
had a nice relaxing morning so it's 325
in the afternoon I'm going to go pick up
my kids from their grandparents house
I'm going to have a typical day I'm just
going to throw a little bit of colored
lip balm on so I don't look freakish but
I'm not gonna put anything else on my
face because I don't really care I'm not
going anywhere
magical I'm just going to go see my mom
so alright so I will check in with you
guys at the end of the day to see how
this war and yeah we'll check in later
so I will see you in a little while and
a little while it's going to happen
right about now Oh how's my hair
I'll stay don't care it even on the on
day I don't care as much as I think some
other people do but that's okay so we
are at the ever-important four hour mark
this is one foundation sometimes starts
to break down I wish that I could always
hit the four hour mark but I don't
always get to so check it out let's see
how it looks I'm going to go ahead and
zoom in real close how are we looking in
comparison with four hours ago
I don't know I'm gonna have to look at
the close-up footage to see I can
definitely see somewhere down in person
but up close you might be able to even
see more that I can see with my naked
eye on my makeup face so so we'll come
back and check with you in another three
hours or so and see if this will last
you through a full school / work day at
least be able to get a good idea of how
the stuff lasts so three hours pass it
right now
these lights are too bright for this
late at night they're blinding me it is
currently 10 52 in the evening and I'm
back a little bit later than I expected
a little issue in the Facebook group but
I've got an amazing admin team we got it
all cleaned up looking good looking nice
and pretty now over there
so what's not looking as pretty is my
face because my baby creams kind of gone
so it has been almost eight hours since
I put on the Holika Holika aqua petit
jelly BB cream and again remember I had
the lighter color on this side and the
darker color on this side but there
really isn't that much of a difference
between the shades but let me zoom you
in so you can see how this looks if you
were going to wear this for a typical
work or school day so this is the side
that has less freckles and the side that
has more freckles and you can see the
side that has more freckles all my
freckles are back as you can see them
all this side actually still looks
pretty good it doesn't look bad but it's
definitely not a very long lasting
product on my normal skin ID I wish that
I could tell you as far as oily skin or
dry skin how this would perform on you I
do sometimes get dry patches around my
nose and on my chin but this did not
seem to accentuate any dryness that I
have on my face but I don't think that
my face is as dry as it normally is
we've had a change in seasons so I think
that's part of it I've also been using
the ordinary skin care that I think has
also been helping but who knows really
when it comes down to it let me go ahead
and zoom me out and give you some final
thoughts sitting in the future when I
use this I'm going to use a primer first
then use this and on top of that I'm
going to put a powder foundation to kind
of increase the coverage I like that
kind of flawless look so not cakey
makeup but just you know I like it all
covered if you let it light
natural-looking
BB cream which is what this is meant to
be that you may really like this
unfortunately it does only come in the
two shades I consider myself a light
medium skin tone so if you are lighter
than me these will probably be too dark
if you of course are darker than me this
will probably not working but then the
thing is is it is kind of a layer
covered so you may be able to get away
with it maybe even mixing it in to
another product if you like the
ingredients leaving me to the
ingredients which I happen to really
really like I personally have no
problems with parabens based on the
research that I've done a lot of the
kind of big bags that we learned about
parabens a lot of that research has been
debunked and even the people that did
that research admit that that research
is not valid so unless you have an
allergic reaction my opinion on parabens
is that they're fine I have no problem
with parabens just as I have no problem
with phenoxyethanol it doesn't affect my
skin but if it does affect your skin you
are not going to like this but there's
there are a lot of really good fun
ingredients in here as algie's and the
hyaluronic acid is really high up in
there so for me you just kind of have to
accept it for what it is which is a
light light to medium coverage BB cream
that doesn't last a really long time so
it depends on what your personal
preferences are for me this is going to
be rated relatively high because I do
like it I am going to continue to use it
is it amazing now is it good sure so
that's it for what the K this week I
