the K where we test out Korean skincare
and beauty products and see if they are
awesome enough for your purchase today
we are going to be testing out the
Golden Monkey glamour lip three-step kit
yes I'm very very excited about this I
got three packs of them of course we're
only going to be testing one today I
bought them off of Amazon I got a three
pack for $12 and 10 cents from a seller
called good decision I ordered them on
February 22nd they arrived on February
24th so it was pretty pretty fast you
can also get these on holy Co holy cos
website which is the name of the company
for six dollars each you can get them at
peach in Lille for four dollars each Miu
teak for seven dollars each and then
Walmart actually sells a three pack on
their website for 12:46 each so I don't
know if they sell them in Walmart stores
or not but they definitely sell them
online so let me tell you a little bit
about what this is it's a three-step
healing treatment for your lips so what
it says it says step one is a lip
peeling patch with a pure cotton sheet
it says pure gold ingredients and
cellulose ingredients help to remove
dead skin cells and care for the area
between fine lines and wrinkles in your
lips and then step two is the volume lip
pack with a hydrogel mask tyler onic
acid extracts provide moisture to the
skin and collagen extracts provides
vitality to the skin
step 3 is a honey lip essence so it says
manuka honey extracts and royal jelly
extracts will nourish your lips and help
them to retain moisture by the pictures
I would say this one makes you have
monkey butt lips this one makes you look
like you just drank a bunch of kool-aid
and this one makes you look like you
just had plastic surgery so that's
that's the the deceptive marketing here
because I actually looked up the
ingredients in here and I didn't see a
lot of the things that I expected from
the claims it's mostly a lot of skin
conditioning agents like for example
first step one we have lotus flower
extract chamomile sage and lemongrass
which are all used for
skin conditioning one ingredient in here
which makes it golden is gold there's
actual gold in the step one I did read
on polish choice calm this is what they
have to say about gold in skincare in
case you've thought about getting gold
or you've gotten gold skincare map that
says it's a common sensitizer so it can
make your skin more sensitive it says it
can it can induce negative responses on
the skin especially on the face and
eyelids claims of gold helping to create
electric charges in skin to trigger
improvement in signs of aging are
completely unproven so just so you know
based on my research there's no evidence
that says that gold is good for your
skin it's you know we we have this
mental attachment to certain things like
food and gold and silver that we think
that they are valuable in every way it's
why we you know want to feed our dogs
things that have food in it that sounds
good to us where it may not be good for
the dog you know what I mean so I think
it's just one of those marketing tactics
at least that's what it seems like for
now it's it for step two about
hyaluronic acid and stuff I didn't see
that in step two maybe I just missed it
but I don't see hyaluronic acid and I
don't see anything with collagen like
usually it says hyaluronic acid and it
doesn't in step two so I don't really
get that I don't know there is witch
hazel and shea butter and cranberry
which is an astringent that causes a
contraction of body tissues there's a
Hoba I mean there there's sacred Lotus
which is skin conditioning and then for
step three again just a lot of skin
conditioning there is rael jelly and
there is a honey extract but they're
actually listed after the dyes which
include the 191 400 which is a yellow
colorant that is one that can cause
irritation and some people in cosmetics
they don't necessarily have to list the
ingredients in order like they do in
food after it gets to a certain percent
they can list them in any order but that
just goes to show that there's about as
much royal jelly in here as there is dye
so it's not gonna be that much different
so it's probably a very very little bit
of royal jelly and very very little bit
of honey so well the proof is in the
monkey
so we're gonna find out whether this
stuff works or not so before we do that
let me get it let's get a close-up on my
lip so you can see if they look like
before
all right golden monkey let's see what
you got in you ooh
slimy slimy okay so it is a sheet that
looks like this it's kind of lip shaped
but it looks like a sheet mask and it
says directions step one use exfoliating
pad to clean lips and gently massage
them smoothly so we're gonna go ahead
and do that
it's got a very strong scent it tastes
like alcohol with a little bit of fruit
in it but not in a good vodka a kind of
way and it feels like there's little
pieces of the mask kind of coming off I
don't think that skin I think that's the
mask yeah it's got a little bit of a
sweetness to it but it mostly tastes
like chemicals on my lips that's not a
pleasant experience okay I forgot to
mention that every single one of these
has fragrance in them so if you don't
like fragrance in your cosmetics then
you don't want to use this they also all
have phenoxyethanol as a preservative
which can be an irritant to some people
if you ever use a toner that kind of
makes your skin feel a little sensitive
that's the way my lips feel right now
they feel a little I don't know they
feel just toned like they're ready for
something I don't know maybe it's all
placebo but I feel like my lips are
ready for step to apply hydrogel lip
patch on the lips and remove it after 15
minutes so he cut this mouth in a tray
here and bring up closer you can see all
right here we go I'll see you in 15
minutes
mmm all right
my idiot self left the tray on the floor
and I just stepped on it so now I'm
gonna have a moisturized bottom of my
left foot all right so that actually was
quite comfortable on the lips it was a
little bit cold but it didn't feel bad
on the lips actually felt quite nice
it's kind of relaxing almost like having
a very thin strip of a jell-o jiggler on
your lips that's exactly what it felt
like but more stable than jello would be
right now is my lips dry they feel very
very sticky like like they just they
feel weird like when I talk it feels
like my lips are not right like they're
like like things are pulling weird I
don't know like they're like the cracks
in my lips I can feel like my skin kind
of holding together but it's not super
sticky this way which is very odd okay
step 3
gently dab lips to absorb a remaining
residue okay step 3 apply honey
treatment patch on dry lips for
moisturizing doesn't say you're supposed
to remove it at all and I guess you just
kind of squeeze it out oh it looks like
honey oh it tastes like honey I have way
too much of my finger so there's plenty
in here or at least I would say five
different lip treatments the jelly
that's in here so you could definitely
use this multiple times like I put way
way way too much on my hand
unfortunately I just wasted like two
applications of it but I'm definitely
gonna save this because it feels very
good it feels kind of slimy but it feels
good it definitely doesn't feel sticky
but it has a very strong honey scent
wiping off any excess I feel like that
you can't really tell how my lips look
because I have all this like slimy stuff
on it so you can't really do a
comparison I'm gonna go ahead and dab
this off my lips you can see if my lips
look any more hydrated than they did in
the beginning without all of this stuff
on it
I'm gonna put a little bit more just
jelly back on because it does feel
really good I wish that they have put
this in like a savable little tube or
something if there have been some kind
of insert in here so you could actually
take it out and just keep that one part
because there's plenty of product in
there so final thoughts on this do I
feel like it was worth my money yeah it
was fun
I don't really feel a huge difference in
my lips but I would imagine after doing
this multiple times that it would do
something I don't I don't know I mean
just based on the ingredients there's
some really great ingredients in here so
I'm hoping that over time it would make
a huge difference I do feel a slight
difference in my lips
they definitely feel more hydrated I
feel like they look more hydrated so and
it was fun you know you just can't talk
for 15 minutes which is kind of weird
for me because I'm a talker but I mean
overall I really think that it was worth
the money I would pay four dollars I
think they're fun it was an enjoyable
experience I would definitely recommend
it I liked it I want to thank you so
much for watching what the K I hope you

moly and it comes in a little cute
little egg carton and you open it up
