lashes today it's not bad girl bang it's
actually fake lashes I just filmed my
boxycharm video and I was like what else
can i film what else can i film and I
was like you know what I really wanted
to do a review of the bad gal bang
mascara I've used it 4 or 5 times at
this point and I do already have some
opinions for you but I already did all
of my makeup so what we're gonna do is
I'm going to actually take off all of my
eye makeup we're gonna apply this and I
will yeah do a full review for you of
this so if that sounds interesting to
you hang tight we're getting into it
right now I feel like the best mascara
reviews are the ones that have no other
eye product on because then you can
really truly see the lashes now if you
haven't seen this yet this is benefits
newest mascara I did get this at the
glam masters premiere party in New York
City as part of the goodie bag so I did
not purchase this but this is not a
sponsored video that being said like I
mentioned in the intro I have tried this
quite a few times and I already have
opinions on it but I do want to show it
show you how it works in action now this
wand is I like to call this Christmas
tree shaped it's kind of or pine tree
shaped if you don't celebrate Christmas
but it's very thin now the bristles are
soft which I feel like makes it
difficult for it to go through the
lashes and separate them so like the
wiggle technique that I feel like works
really really well with very hard
plastic bristles does not seem to be
working for this mascara but I do find
how soft these bristles are to be quite
unique in mascara wands usually the
bristles that are like this are much
harder and less flexible now they are
very very closely spaced together which
is a good thing for me I feel like that
Lay's product on a much better than when
they're further spaced apart so that is
a good thing the other thing is is that
the wand is quite flexible so I do enjoy
that I feel like it kind of hugs the
lashes better if it's more flexible so
that's a policy
now without gabbing on anymore about
this I want to go ahead and zoom you in
and let's put on this mascara together
just a little bit of what the deal is
with my lashes I very short sparse
lashes so no mascara ever makes me look
like I truly have false lashes like ever
what I like in a mascara is I like both
lengthening and volumizing I need both
in my life without both I feel like it
just kind of falls flat I am a big fan
of drugstore mascaras there's quite a
few that I enjoy including the L'Oreal
voluminous butterfly I also enjoy the
essence lash princess the orange one
specifically I like the green one to
Jordana best lash extreme there's a
couple other ones I'll link them down
below
hopefully I remembered to do it this
time I felt so bad last time I did a
video like this I said on link it down
below and I didn't remember to link it
until like 10,000 views later I'm like
yeah that was a fail
all right so let's go ahead and zoom in
on the lashes you can see what one coat
looks like so there is one coat and then
there's with nothing so as you can see
there is quite a bit of length added by
the mascara but it doesn't give me a ton
of volume so you have to think about
your own personal needs as far as
mascaras go so let's go ahead and add
the second coat so there you go let's go
ahead and check out the lashes and it is
giving me some serious serious length
and there's with nothing so really
really big difference as far as the
length again where we're lacking here is
on the volume not a ton of volume I'm
gonna go ahead and do the other eye and
we'll zoom back out
so here are two coats on both eyes
I was going to do like a shorter video
for this but I just can't I feel like
I'm short cutting it if I don't do the
whole thing so just some additional
information that I feel like I would
want to know
I found this mascara first off is the
cruelty free status of the brand benefit
does not test their final products on
animals but they do sell in mainland
China so they do benefit from animal
testing therefore they are not cruelty
free this is a $24 mascara you can get
it at benefit Sephora and Ulta and I
believe some other places the claims on
this which we can talk about together
now that we've seen it applied it says
it's 36-hour wear now we will not test
because I'm taking this off before 36
hours it says it's a full blast
volumizing mascara I would not call this
a volumizing mascara I would call this a
lengthening mascara the the thing about
volumizing mascaras is that they
typically have a more clumpy thick
formula this is thinner it is wetter
this is not for me a volumizing formula
it says it creates a massive volume
without weighing down lashes I do agree
that it does not weigh down my lashes
gravity defying formula builds volume
the more you layer I guess now that it's
dried a little bit we can do it one more
layer and just like make sure that I
can't build more volume might as well
try it right can't hurt
see now my lashes are clumpy and I'm
starting to get spider lashes because my
my lashes are dry and this is not
looking cute though but we are getting
even more length but there spidering out
and it's not cute in my opinion I don't
like the way that that looks no we'll do
the other a lot the other side just so
they can be spider friends together but
I definitely do not recommend waiting
for this to completely dry before you
add the coats that you want to add
because it is not cute but it is still
continuing to add length I wouldn't say
that it's adding volume though not
really I don't know I I like it less now
now that I did that
and it says it contains arrow particles
I guess that's where they get the space
theme from one of the lightest known
materials it definitely it does feel
very lightweight I will definitely give
it that I love this derived from space
technology okay sure let's let's go with
that let's let's pretend that's real
this innovative intense pitch black
mascara do you agree with that layers
easily for bigger and bigger impact I do
think that it does layer nicely so if
you just went a little bit you can just
put one layer on and it definitely
builds the more you go but I right now I
am not happy with the third coat after
it is completely dried the custom big
slim packed brush is streamlined to
reach root to tip I do really like some
things about the one I feel feel like
it's a nice length for my size eyes I do
feel like it's easy to use and that I
don't feel like I could have to go like
a rant rant in order to get it to work I
don't feel like I'm accidentally making
the wand go places I don't want it to go
because of the shape of the wand
oh it says I can do lower lashes big
volume with a 360 degree reach that's an
interesting statement as well so let's
do a little bit of lower lash line and I
have to say it is easy to put on the
lower lash line and I actually might use
this more for lower lash line because I
do think that looks really cute and
because it's so small at the tip it's
easy to get that outer corner I'm gonna
zoom you in so you can see how the lower
lash line looks I like it I think that
looks really good the first bullet point
on here smudge proof water-resistant
volumizing mascara so I'm gonna let that
dry completely and we're gonna test
those things 90 percent saw dramatic
volume
I guess I'm part of the 10% 94 said it
instantly lifted lashes I would agree
with that 92% said
lengthen lashings I agree with that
pro-vitamin be known to fuel thickness
and strength that's not something we're
gonna be able to test today as far as
the ingredients go the ingredients are
pretty typical mascara ingredients the
preservative in here is a very very
common preservative called
phenoxyethanol
if you are sensitive to it of course
you're not going to want to get this but
if you've never had sensitivity to any
cosmetic before phenoxyethanol is it's
in so much stuff so I'm going to give
this just a minute to a couple
minutes to dry we're gonna try
smudge-proof and then we're gonna try
water-resistant and see how that goes
it's been about six minutes since I put
on the mascara so we're gonna do a
couple of things first thing is the
smudge test so I'm just gonna take my
finger and I'm gonna rub on this eye to
see if we have smudging it is smudge
resistant I've got some flaking going on
because of me rubbing my eye I don't
typically have problems with flaking of
mascara but if you do that may be a sign
that you will get some flaking with this
mascara but I definitely agree that I do
I'm not getting a lot of smudging just
more a little bit of flaking now because
I love you so much if you know me and
you know me well you know I don't like
to put anything wet randomly on my face
I don't like setting sprays I don't
things like that but we're going to dump
water on this half of my face just see
if we can get this mascara is water
resistant so let's try it out oh my gosh
am I really doing this I think I am
alright here we go oh my gosh it's gonna
be cold oh my gosh okay okay I did it
I'm gonna try not to rub my eye but
we'll just kind of Pat around okay and I
don't see I got water in my eyeball okay
I don't see any smudging or water you
know it's not running everywhere I know
Tammy Faye Baker happening now I'm gonna
see if I can smudge it now that it's a
little bit wet let's see what I can
smudge it okay we're getting smudging so
if you have a fit of tears
hopefully tears of happiness and you get
mascara you get your mascara wet don't
rub your eye just kind of try to blink
it away because you will get some
smudging but I'm kind of rescuing it
it's kind of give it a little fluff and
I still have mascara on and I have
rescued my eye look apparently so not
terrible on that final thoughts based on
my impression after trying this a few
times is I do like this mascara do I
love this mascara no I don't
don't love it and that's because of the
volume factor because I need that but if
you're someone that just is looking for
a lengthening mascara you'll probably
really like this I like that it doesn't
smudge because sometimes I forget and I
accidentally rub my eyes a little bit
and it's nice that it won't smudge so
ours removal of this it does remove very
easily with an oil-based makeup remover
I usually use one of those cleansing
balms as my first step in cleansing my
face in the evening so it has no problem
coming off I don't feel like I have to
rip my lashes out in order to remove it
so that's a really good thing so overall
it's a good mascara but not a great
mascara for me personally you just have
to think about your own personal needs
and desires and kind of decide from
there whether this is something you want
to try so I want to thank you so much
