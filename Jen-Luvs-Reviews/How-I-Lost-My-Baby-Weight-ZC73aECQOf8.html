a very different video but I know some
of my YouTube friends are interested in
this topic and I wanted to kind of throw
my input out there on the topic you may
not know but I used to weigh 60 pounds
more than I weigh now which on a smaller
frame makes a really big difference
right there is a video that I shot when
I WAYNE 60 pounds heavier and that was
right after I had my daughter and of
course right after you have a kid you're
going to have for the most part a little
more weight on you and I did my problem
was I had a lot of trouble getting that
weight off about a year after I had my
daughter we really made a huge change in
our diet and what we were eating which
I'll talk to you about that in a second
and then after I had my son I started
going to the gym which really kind of
put the icing on the cake for me you
know the healthy cake for me so that I
could get back to my goal weight which
is where i am now which is about 125 to
130 in that video that i'm showing there
i was 185 i believe something like that
so without further ado here are the
things that I did in order to lose a mud
baby weight i'm going to get rid of that
because i don't really want to see that
anymore and I don't really want you to
see it anymore the first thing that I
think is the most important thing is
about food because I from what I've read
eighty percent of what you of the weight
you lose is due to your diet and I'll
tell you I never wants counting calories
ever because I'm not a writing down in a
journal what I ate or you know all those
food apps I just am not good at that i'm
not good at keeping track of things for
long periods of time what i did was i
just started eating good food i cut all
processed foods out of my diet except
for an occasional like little square of
chocolate something like that some kind
of little thing here and there just as
something to kind of quench that
craving for processed food junk food but
honestly I really only craved sugar
after I cut out the processed food I
never craved chips I never creped soda I
never craved any of those things because
they weren't my addictions my addiction
was chocolate so I did allow myself to
have a little bit of chocolate here and
there as I was losing the weight but
what I noticed was the more I ate
chocolate and the more I went off of the
natural foods the slower my progress was
it didn't make me go back to the start
which i think is a mistake a lot of
people make is they were like well i
just ate this big meal now I'm back to
where I started and I don't think that
that's true but I do think it makes you
go slower so if you want to go fast
through losing weight you have to cut in
my opinion what worked for me is cutting
out the processed food anything that's
not real food our body doesn't know how
to process that our body doesn't know
what hydrogenated oils are it doesn't
know what to do with it it wasn't made
to eat that stuff and things that people
say are really healthy can really make
you gain weight if you don't eat them in
moderation you know i mean i think it's
it's really important just to eat things
that come from nature eating fruit
eating vegetables eating meat in my
opinion is a very good thing so my
advice based on what my experience was
is to stop worrying about counting
calories stop worrying about how much
you're eating but just worry about the
quality of the food you're eating
because if you cut out processed foods i
guarantee you if you've been eating a
lot of them it will make a difference
okay my other tips have to do with going
to the gym um first of all if you don't
let go into the gym and working out with
weights then you shouldn't be going to
the gym and working out with weights if
you don't like doing classes you
shouldn't be doing classes you need to
find something that you enjoy whatever
that may be so when you go to the gym
have a plan of what you're going to do
whatever it is because if you don't have
a plan like I had not had a plan many
many times for many years when I went to
the gym I just kind of wander around and
I go over to that machine and I do some
reps and then I go over to the treadmill
and I run or I go to the elliptical and
I do a little bit and I go to
she it's a waste of time in my opinion
to just be wandering around through most
of the time that you're at the gym you
got to make the most of the time that
you're there what really worked for me
was going on bodybuilding.com and
they're not sponsoring this video and
I'm just being honest I went to
bodybuilding com and i found a workout
plan that worked for me for me it was
legal abroad as workouts which you'll
find on there before I started doing
that I was doing crossfit which is
insanely expensive but is works
amazingly if you can afford to go to
crossfit i highly suggest you go to
CrossFit because it's it's fabulous and
I could do a whole other video just
talking about how amazing crossfit us
but CrossFit was amazing for me and then
doing this little broader workout was
great for me but on bodybuilding com you
you answer like a little quiz about what
you're trying to do and then it gives in
with a male female and it gives you a
list of different workouts that might be
right for you you click through you find
one that's good you print it out you put
it on your phone whatever you take it to
the gym with you and you do what it says
the next tip is a more of an emotional
tip and it's about not worrying about
what other people are thinking about you
while you're in the gym I go to one of
those regular you know Globo gyms where
you need got people of all different
sizes men women everywhere and when I
walk through the gym people are
constantly glancing over at me okay and
you can think whatever you think about
what they're thinking one there glancing
over at me but the way that I feel about
is I feel like they're wondering whether
i'm looking at them you know they're
looking at me wondering I'm looking at
them to see it that they have bigger
thighs than me or you know they want to
know what I'm doing for my workouts
because they maybe they want to do
whatever I just don't I don't worry
about I don't care whether somebody's
looking at me because I'm looking back
at them and maybe they're thinking I'm
judging them and it just becomes this
big mess of thoughts in your head and
most of it is probably complete fantasy
I mean it not even real so stop worrying
about what other people are thinking
this is this is your workout now I will
tell you well I am working out I make
some of the ugliest faces I'm all and
the reason why I make ugly faces because
I feel like it gives me a better workout
when I make ugly faces and I'm not going
to the gym to look good in the gym I'm
going to look
outside the gym I'm going to go to the
gym to make myself have a healthier and
better life it has nothing to do with
the people that are there okay you got
to get past that somehow if you're going
to go to a gym because anybody that's
there that's looking at you needs to
respect you for being there just because
you walk through the door because you
have a same goal as everybody else which
is to be healthier to look better or to
you know be able to move better or
whatever your specific goal is I
guarantee you most of the people there
have the exact same goal of you so you
are the same as everybody else no matter
what stage you are in your weight loss
for your health journey so those are
just some quick things that I did in
order to lose that way do you like me to
get a little more technical about how I
work out and and what kinds of workouts
I feel are better than others um let me
know and I'd be happy to make another
video about it if you do want more
information about things like this I do
have a suggestion for you of YouTube
videos and that's my husband's videos
and his name is John Guerin cesky and i
will put a link to his videos right
there there he is isn't he cute he's so
cute besides being a tattoo artist and
tattoo shop owner he is also a certified
health and nutrition coach he's got a
lot of knowledge about Hell nutrition
and and working out and losing weight
and all of those things and he's got
some really good like quick very
informative videos on the topic you
might be interested in so if you want to
know more about that click there i also
put a link down below to his channel and
honestly like if i didn't have him on
board with me with the nutrition with
the going to the gym i feel like i would
have had a much harder time making
progress so if you can get somebody on
board with you that has the same goals
they can hold you accountable that can
be on that journey with you hopefully
ideal i think is someone that you live
with so that the people you live with
aren't eating completely different foods
than you are I think that makes a huge
difference to I'm really putting this
out there because I feel like having a
healthier existent
has improved my life so much because
even when I was thin before I had kids I
wasn't healthy I didn't have the energy
i have now I didn't have the strength
that I have now now I can carry all my
groceries in in one trip um I can you
play with my kids I can run around I can
pick them up and throw them around and I
can have so much fun with them because
I'm healthier because I have more
endurance because I have more strength
because I go to the gym and that's why I
keep going is because I like the way
that I feel go out and live a healthy
life mad love and I will see you in the
next video which will probably make up
related that love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
