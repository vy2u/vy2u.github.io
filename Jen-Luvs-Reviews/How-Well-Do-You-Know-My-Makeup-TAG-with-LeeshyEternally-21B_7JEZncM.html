unique and special video I've invited my
friends lishi over to do a tag video and
I'm so excited to do this at least you
may remember from the best in beauty
competition really lore'l if you haven't
seen her video she's amazing and really
really fun so she does a lot of fashion
videos so if you're lacking the fashion
videos in my my channel definitely had
over two leashes channel she's wonderful
but we are here to do the what's it
called again remind me how well do you
know I makeup how well do you know my
makeup tag this was actually invented by
emilynoel83 i'm a girl kristen game who
did it on their channels and basically
what we do is we just filmed on leashes
channel me being blindfolded and having
to guess guess leashes make up just by
touching it and i can't say that i did
very well so you'll probably laugh at me
quite a bit because you will think that
this is very obvious when it was not
obvious to me so head over leashes
channel to see that video that should be
up live now we're gonna do now lishi
blindfolded guessing my makeup so we
shall see how this goes alright are you
ready yes let's jump in I kind of say
that I was so excited driving over here
so i knew i would hear you say hello my
YouTube friends in front of me yeah ah
that's what Jim says oh yeah this is
complete darkness it is it is yeah no no
I can't see anything yes okay so this is
the first product this is exciting and
also important you guys can you say it
is I don't know if I could oh I didn't
show them the products for a time that's
okay maybe it's something she doesn't
use cuz if it's something you don't use
it's really hard yeah okay um it's like
a powder uh-huh okay um I don't know the
brand though I think of packaging and
no no I guess it's a little nondescript
I don't know the brand but I know it's
some kind of a powder product it's large
and I'm not gonna touch it because it
was on your face you know I don't know
but I know it's a powder okay it's a
drugstore or Christ or uh is it l'oreal
