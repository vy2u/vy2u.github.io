everyday people where I give you tips
for just everyday people who just want
to do something different or improve
their makeup application skills I'm
really excited to share with you how I
found my perfect contour shade it's
super easy and you can totally do it too
I'm going to show you how to do that
right now
what's great about this video is I'm not
just gonna show you how to find your
perfect contour shade I'm also going to
show you how to apply your contour in
the right space for your individual face
there's so many tutorials out there for
how to apply different makeup but
sometimes it works for your face shape
and sometimes it doesn't
these tips are gonna help anybody of any
skin tone and any face shape to contour
so let's go ahead and get started we're
gonna focus just on the cheeks today and
for me the purpose of contouring is to
kind of hollow out my cheeks a little
bit to bring my cheekbones forward so
that my face looks a bit slimmer now if
you already have prominent cheekbones
you probably don't even really need to
contour your cheeks so don't feel like
just because contouring is a thing that
you need to do it personally I love the
way that it looks we're gonna use all
drugstore products today and all
drugstore tools so that more people can
access the things that I am showing you
so what you're gonna do is you're going
to do the opposite of what you like with
a selfie which is to purposely put a
shadow on your face with your phone the
way that I think is the best way to do
this is to go outside on a sunny day and
put it in front of the Sun you can close
your eyes if you want don't look
directly at the Sun please and take a
picture of yourself here the pictures
that I took one is in sunlight and one
is under my filming lights you don't
want to take a photo in home lighting
where your face looks yellow I know
you've seen those pictures of yourself
or others where it's got a yellow tone
because of that warm home lady it's
really important to look at the photo
and look at your face in a mirror and
see whether it actually looks like your
natural skin tone because if it's too
yellow it's not going to work it has to
look like your real skin tone then what
you're going to do is you're going to
take your photo and you're going to put
it on to your computer now this is the
tool that I use but you can use any tool
you want that has a color picker so I
use PicMonkey to make my thumbnails for
YouTube and it just so happens that the
text feature on there does have a color
picker so what I do is I import my photo
and I make
so it's ready to insert some text and
type whatever you want it doesn't even
matter
and then you're going to color pick the
lighter part of the shaded section you
don't want to go super dark you want it
to be just different than what your
natural skin tone is and you can even
look and see on the same place on the
lit side you can look and see whether it
is different or not but you want to get
that shadowed color of your natural skin
tone it looks when you first glance out
that it might be gray but it's actually
not it's gonna give you just a darker
version of your skin tone that is your
perfect contour shade
now I'm going to show you the photo from
under my filming lights these are LED
cool-toned
lights and you can see that it is a
little bit warmer my skin tone just
looks a little more flushed a little
warmer this is as warm as I ever want to
go with my contour I don't want to go
warmer because it's gonna start looking
orange on me so now I have found my
perfect contour shades and I can compare
that to things I already own I can take
a photo of these photos I can take a
print out whatever I want to the store
and match up these colors with the
colors that are in the store or in my
own personal collection to find my
perfect contour shade now what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna show you how I
apply my contour and some tips and
tricks that I've learned along the way
for not getting that whole bearded look
that looks really weird I'm gonna show
you where to place your contour right
now so now that we have found our
contour shade let's go ahead and contour
so what you want to do is you can take a
makeup brush or any other pen or
something and what you're gonna do is
you're gonna line up
the top of your ear right here to your
lip and that is your contour line now
what I used to do which was the big
mistake was I used to go like this I'm
gonna put it right here you see the
difference and then it looks like you
have a beard so right here - right here
which looks like it's in blush territory
but it kind of is but it isn't so your
blush is gonna go kind of overlapping so
here's your contour line your highlight
line is on top of your cheek bone and
then your blush kind of goes overlapping
in the middle if that makes sense we're
gonna do it all so I'm gonna take my ELF
contour kit and I'm going to dip in this
elf brush and I don't know what the name
of this brush is but it's the number-10
for it's from their newer line these are
really nice brushes and I'm just gonna
start at the top like almost like
playing pool right and we're gonna just
kind of draw and stamp toward the inner
corner of the lip now we want to stop
kind of where the center of the eye is
right here
so you can see I would need to go just a
loop my eyeliners a little off there Oh
mom on there but this isn't an eyeliner
video so we're in good shape
and I'm gonna kind of make it just a
little bit further but you want the
deepest color to be right in the back
you want the lightest color to be in the
front so don't dip your product back in
if you feel like you need more product
to get to the center of your eye swipe
it down and drag some of that product
forward instead of adding more product
in the front okay so now that I've got
that line there now I'm going to blend
it out this is the elf blush brush
another fantastic product and I'm just
going to in circular motions just kind
of blend that out you don't want to go
too much lower so you want to kind of go
upward circular and it's okay at this
point if it still seems a little bit
dark because you're gonna add your blush
and if you want to your highlight at
this point go ahead and do the other
side
I was trying to think what blush I
wanted to use then I was like oh my gosh
I forgot perfusion had sent me their
holiday collection so we're gonna use
this bad boy right here this shade would
be a little bit more subtle of a contour
but we weren't going for that today
because you know I'm trying to show you
and you got to be able to see it so
we're gonna go ahead for blush and we're
gonna go in a little bit with bloom and
a little bit with first date holy moly
that's a lot of lot on there hopefully
this comes out okay because that's a lot
of pigment here okay and we're gonna put
that right over top of the contour so
almost like it stripes it out that is a
lot of pigment we're gonna blend that in
a second holy moly okay so now I'm gonna
tap off all the excess product because
that's enough and then blend the contour
into the blush
I've seen photos where they say if you
have a square face you should really
stick to the apples of your cheeks as
far as blush application because I have
an oval face I like to just follow my
contour since we got out this palette we
might as well use the highlight in here
so I'm going to go in with this elated
shade hopefully you can see mmm
my focus keeps going out when my
eyeballs go out there we go let's go in
to you late in and we'll put that right
on the tops of the cheekbones right
above the blush line so almost like
think about it like Neapolitan ice cream
you've got your highlight which is your
vanilla and then your your strawberry
which is your blush and then your
chocolate which is your contour that's
always the way that I like I always see
it when I put it on and you definitely
want to keep your highlight up as high
as your cheekbones are like I don't
quite match so I'm gonna go back over
with the blush a little bit so back into
bloom and first-date chop that off this
time who's that pigmentation will trace
and then back into the contour just a
little bit feel like right there I could
use just a little bit more and then
we're just gonna blend it all out but
being careful not to get any highlight
down low now in real life this is a lot
of blush but under these bright lights I
wanted you to be able to see it so I
eased it up quite a bit but if you're
going to work or school you definitely
don't mean probably not definitely but
you probably don't want it as bright as
I have it in my natural mirror right
here so a little bit crazy I look like
I'm going to a dance competition or
something but for you it looks pretty
good all right I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom you out now for final thoughts so
as you can see once you find the right
shades it's really not super difficult
to apply the contour if you know where
to go on your own particular face and
you know how far to go so again starting
at the top of the ear pointing down
toward you've the corners of your mouth
like a pool stick almost like you're
shooting for that eight ball and then
stopping in the center of your like
right where the middle of your eyes are
and making sure that the majority of the
product is in the back fade it out to
the front you don't want a super dark in
the middle you want the darker part on
the outside faded in I hope you found
