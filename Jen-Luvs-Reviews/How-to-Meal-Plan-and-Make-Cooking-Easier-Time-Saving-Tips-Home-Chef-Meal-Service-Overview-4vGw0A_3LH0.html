video for you today I have been tweeting
recently about how much I love grocery
shopping and how much I love cooking
dinner and people are like Jan you are
crazy girl you are crazy
when home chef contacted me and asked me
to do a sponsor video on their service I
was like you know what I can do so much
with this so if you're interested in any
of that I'm gonna be getting into that
right now so today I actually wasn't
planning on filming I got a giant box of
makeup from covergirl of their spring
line so I did a little get ready not
getting ready with me but like a first
impressions of the covergirl makeup but
of course I can't leave it at a first
impression so there's gonna be more so
that part one I film today and I figured
well I might as well do the home chef
video now too because I'm kind of on a
roll here so before I go any further I
do wanna let you know this video was
sponsored by home chef I don't normally
take sponsorships of things that are not
makeup related because this is a makeup
Channel but because I love home chef so
much and I'm gonna show you my recipe
book from home chef's to prove how much
I loved home chef's even wavy for this
but I feel like this is such a good
service and home chef is actually the
fourth home food subscription service
that I've tried and this is the one I've
been with with for the longest and
there's good reason why that we're gonna
go into in a minute but before we go
into home chef and what the deal is with
that I do want to tell you a little bit
about how I've gotten to love bro Surrey
shopping and what I do and part of it is
due to home chef I'm gonna go ahead and
zoom in on my phone so I can explain to
you what I do as far as my meal planning
before I go to the grocery shorts this
is what I do for meal planning and I
don't know if there is an alternative
for the the phone the way that I use my
phone for Android but you would probably
know if you have an Android if you have
something similar but this is what I do
so I think about how many meals I'm
gonna need for the week usually for a
home chef i order two meals per week so
that means i'm gonna need like maybe
three or four more meals in addition to
that because we'll have like a leftover
night may sometimes we'll go out to
dinner once a week we try not to do that
once a week because it goes wrong
expensive but I get usually three other
meals along with home chefs now that
home chef has sent me the of a second
binder I've now been able to separate my
recipes into two different binders so
this is my chicken fish and smoothy
binder so I'm just gonna pick some
random recipes out of here this one's
really really good a farmhouse fried
chicken you can see I've got like food
splattered on it probably good to like
laminate them or something oh this was
one that was similar but it's slightly
different and how you make it but it's
similar this one was really good we'll
take that one the crispy onion chicken I
made that one a few times and then we'll
just do the ranch chicken quesadillas so
I mean these of course are organized by
chicken so they're all gonna be chicken
I wouldn't normally do that normally I
would pick a fish a chicken and actually
let's go and pick a fish one out my
son's on a salmon a boycot right now so
I usually use salmon instead of
steelhead trout even the Stella trout
was amazing and my daughter is on a
shrimp boycott so we're not using that
one right now this one's really good
parmesan crusted Cod let's take that one
out so now we'll go to my phone and my
husband and I have a shared note so I go
to my notes and then I go to my grocery
list and you'll see here that we
actually have this shared between the
two of us where he can make edits and it
will it'll go directly to my phone
whatever he edits and I'll put either a
video link or directions down below for
how to do that because I my husband set
it up I honestly don't know how but as I
go through I figure out what's in here
so I'm gonna need I have butter in the
refrigerator but I'm definitely gonna
need a lemon so I'm gonna uncheck lemon
and then these are all things that we've
by relatively regularly so we kind of
keep that going and then occasionally
we'll add new things so let's see we're
gonna need some grape tomatoes and we
don't have that on there so I'm just
gonna add that real quick it's gonna put
the little check mark and then typing
upside down is hard is that a P or Q if
that's a Q I can't do what upside down
all right I'm just gonna type it this
way okay so now that's on there and then
the cod so I'll go down to the fish
fresh seafood
wrong one stop it okay and you kind of
get the point so I do this for every
grated Parmesan cheese I do this for
every meal so that I have it in my phone
when I go grocery shopping and one thing
that's also important about this is that
we have it set in order of the
organization of our grocery store so
when you walk into our grocery store you
see the fruits and veggies first and
then after the fruits and veggies you'll
see the fresh herbs are with that and
then there's a olive and cheese bar that
you can walk past my husband likes that
I don't I'm not an olive person and then
the deli and you've got it all organized
you know by the organization of
groceries or so as I walk through I
don't have to skip around everywhere and
it just makes it so much more pleasant
of a trip to the grocery store so then
what I do once I've gone shopping I've
unchecked everything as I go I check
everything off as I'm at the grocery
store and then I take these and I throw
them in the top drawer in my kitchen
where I kind of keep all of my utensils
and things I throw these in there so
then when it's time for dinner all I
have to do is flip through and say okay
which recipe do I want to do tonight and
then I just grab one and it just makes
things so stinkin easy like I don't even
have to think I just know what meal I
mean what meals I have as options and
it's very very easy and this saves me so
much time so much headache and the thing
is too is they're all pre-screened you
know if there's ever a meal from home
chef that we don't enjoy I just throw it
in trash so these are all meals that my
family has enjoyed so I know that we're
gonna have everybody eating at the table
which is fantastic so now that we have
touched on that I'm gonna go ahead and
take you down to my kitchen and we are
going to cook a home chef meal together
so you can see how it all works and I'll
tell you about you know kind of the pros
and cons of the service but honestly
it's mostly pros so let's go head down
to the kitchen and I'll show you what
the deal is with it okay so this is the
home chef box this is how it comes to
the front door as you open it up the
recipes are always laying on top so this
week we've got sesame beef
and then we've got some glazed pork
tenderloin and then this is the one
we're gonna make tonight which is called
chicken scampi and on the back here
you'll find the recipe with some photos
and details for the recipe they're
actually usually very easy to follow
I do recommend reading through the whole
thing before you start though that helps
a lot alright so as you open up the
packaging you'll see that everything is
individually wrapped in meals which is
really really nice to have them in
different bags or some food
subscriptions they just kind of throw
everything in the box but having them in
individual bags makes it easy for
everything to be stored in the
refrigerator and then easy to grab when
it's time to cook those little tiny
steps really do make a difference when
it comes to getting ready to prepare
dinner so that was this chicken scampi
ingredient and then this is the
ingredients for the pork tenderloin and
I've never had like I've had with other
fruit subscriptions this is why I stayed
with um chef I've had problems with food
coming moldy or coming bad from other
subscriptions I've never had that
problem with home chef and then these
are the ingredients for the beef and
you'll notice on the bottom this is
where they keep the meat so they
separate the meat from the rest of the
food and you see there's that's an ice
pack there and all of this stuff they
give you directions for how to recycle
it so they separate the meat into a
separate bag usually that zip closed
everyone smile it's not which is
definitely a critique that I have of the
brand I that they need to make sure they
close their meat bags all the way so all
of the meat is individually packed in
this extra bag and they do give a decent
amount of meat I remember I tried a food
subscription that was out of Georgia and
they never gave enough meat it's always
like why why is there not enough food
here but home chef I've never had a
problem with that now here is your
binder and I'm gonna show you in a
second my full binder of recipes I'm
really actually very thankful that they
sent another one because I was running
out of room in my first one that I
gotten in my initial box so you get this
it says welcome home chef and then it
just kind of gives you some tips and
tricks for using the service and just
kind of gives you some some information
about the service in general and then on
the back you can see how the directions
for how to recycle everything that's in
the box hello welcome to Mike
this is take two because my idiot self
forgot to turn the microphone on
great job Jin so I don't know how the
sound is gonna turn out in here it
sounds a little echoey to me but it's
just my kitchen I don't usually film in
my kitchen so and I'm not gonna make a
habit of it but this is you know it's a
special video before I show you what I
already did with the microphone off go
ahead and show you my home chef binder
when you get your first order home chef
you get a notebook like this like I
showed you in the unboxing and I put all
of my recipes in here that I am keeping
you can see how many of them there are
I've been doing home chef for quite a
while I also have these guys as well
remember it's two a week is what I
typically do so it's taken me quite a
while to accumulate all of these but I
want to show you my favorites my
favorite favorite favorite one ever was
one that we got for Halloween and it's
just one right here oh my gosh I've made
this I don't know like maybe four or
five times the kids love this one
because not only is it does it taste
really good but it's got these cute
little mashed potato coats in there that
are just absolutely adorable I'm Lila
had one of her friends over for dinner
and I made this and they just had so
much fun like eating their face off like
you know and like eating their faces I
don't know we're weird but anyway it's
just a lot of fun so it's recipes like
this and you can choose which is really
nice they give you so much to choose
from every week so you can really pick
things that are good for you and your
family so I mean anywhere from like
these Mediterranean fish cakes these
things are awesome these let's see porch
- shoo shoo my meatballs now I'm just
really gonna put a star on that one cuz
everybody really liked that one we've
got what else is in here I mean all
kinds of this one was really good this
is homemade mozzarella sticks basically
so crispy mozzarella fritters I don't
usually know I have done it over the
salad since then it's really good but
sometimes I'll just make the fritters as
a side and then make it with something
else like burgers or something and it's
really really good so anyway that's my
home chef recipes and I do save them and
I do reuse them so it's like getting a
cookbook - so let's go ahead and go
down to the table and you'll just see my
little hands work and he work in and
let's put this meal together tonight
we're gonna do this one right here that
way this one is the chicken stampy with
the croutons now my husband decided he
wanted to he wanted to join us for
dinner so I do have a little bit of
extra chicken that I'm going to add
because of what I ordered was just for
two people which is what I normally
order for just me and the kids but
because he's joining us I'm gonna add a
little extra chicken so all I did
without the microphone on was cut up the
roll so I'll show you just a real quick
clip of that right now and I just cut it
with a bread knife super easy to do and
this is gonna be the croutons now as you
can see if this was for two people this
will be plenty of meat but I am going to
add a little bit like I said for my
husband so one thing I really love about
home chef is and this is legit this is
not just me blowing smoke this is legit
there are other food subscriptions that
just send you a big garlic bulb so I
ended up wasting a lot of the garlic and
I'd spend like 10 minutes peeling the
garlic little things like them peeling
the garlic for you really makes a huge
difference as far as time goes they also
pre measure everything so the karmesan
cheese is pre measured in here I think
the recipe says you use it twice but
it's pre measured which is great I also
love that here it's like basically like
idiot proof you know which of course I
need so it tells you everything you need
I like to get all of this stuff out
ahead of time with you know the olive
oil is salt in the pepper that's pretty
standard the baking sheet they usually
have you do this so that really helps
with cleanup to do a baking sheet with
foil over it and then just some cooking
spray over top of it that's pretty
standard for directions for them they
also tell you what tools you're going to
need like a large pot a colander and a
large non-stick pan so I like to get all
that stuff out ahead of time because the
last thing I want is to need something
and I need something and then I don't
have it so I've already I've started
with a step number one which was cutting
the bread into 1-inch dice now I'm going
to go ahead and mince the garlic I don't
know if you're supposed to but I like to
cut these little nubby guys off on the
ends just because I think they're ugly
sorry you're not pretty enough to be in
my dinner now what I do is I thought I
was preheated so I did preheat the oven
to 400 degrees
so what I do is I kind of slice these
into slices and then I've got this like
choppy thing and I just kind of kind of
roll it on there another thing that I've
done in the past that also works a box
grater and I just use the large side but
I always feel like I'm gonna chop my
fingers off so I'm scared of box graders
a little bit I've actually scant quite a
few knuckles using a box grater in the
past my family doesn't mind garlic so
I'm gonna just leave this as like a
coarse chop
instead of like truly minced it really
doesn't matter I mean the thing about
that's great about cooking versus baking
is you can kind of eyeball things you
don't have to worry about being perfect
you just kind of have fun with it which
I personally really like okay so I'm
noticing that the pot that I put on the
oven is now boiling so I'm gonna go
ahead and add the noodles to that
because I have children that are a
little bit younger and don't really spin
Forks very well I'm gonna go ahead and
just break this in half before I add it
to the water just to make it a little
more manageable for them and timer for
seven minutes go ahead and set my garlic
aside I don't need that right now
it's a zest and have the lemon juice
half and quarter or the remaining half
so one thing you can do for juicing if
you want to is kind of as you can
microwave it and then you can roll it a
little bit to get extra juice personally
I don't have the patience so I don't do
that so I didn't test it first darn I
always forget to do that but one of zest
the sticker take the sticker off Jen
this is a lot easier to do if you don't
slice it first but it's all good so this
is a what is it called like a plane
hydroplane I don't know some kind of
plane something or another and this
works really really well you can also
use that box grater alright so once I've
got all the skin off and see I'm just
gonna kind of push all that off and then
I've got one lemons worth of zest there
we're done with this put that in the
sink score
and then I'm gonna juice you know I got
one of those fancy like juice things
where it squeezes the the lemon in it
and or the lime or the orange or
whatever and honestly like I like this
old fashioned kind better I feel like it
works the best my memory card ran out of
juice so I just had to spend a while
fixing that problem so the time has gone
by quite a bit while I was gone fixing
my memory card I did drain the noodles
and I saved a bunch of the water now I
do like to use paper plates for handling
chicken because I like to throw
everything away when I handle chicken
it's nothing to mess with
so what I'm gonna do now is recommended
by most of the food subscriptions that I
have done I if not all of them which is
padding the chicken dry and then
seasoning with salt and pepper
I do not underestimate the power of salt
and pepper if you are not a cooking kind
of person just take some chicken throw
some salt and pepper on it cook it in a
pan with some oil until it's cooked all
the way through and it's good it's good
and just like that I promise like I
mentioned I am gonna add just a little
bit extra chicken for my husband to eat
but that is not home chefs fault that is
my fault for not ordering him enough
food
so now I'm gonna go ahead and add the
bread onto the pan and you're supposed
to add a tablespoon of olive oil
I don't ever measure I just kind of go
like this right and then over here where
the chicken isn't I'm just gonna take it
and I'm just gonna put my hands in it
and I'm going to just toss it yep
so just bring tossing it around just
getting olive oil all over everything so
now this is supposed to cook for eight
to ten minutes I usually do just nine
minutes okay so we're supposed to heat
the pan and then add the olive oil and
the chicken and then cook it so I'm just
gonna eyeball it I just kind of like
again I just splat it in there I don't
measure it and the way there's a couple
ways you can tell if it's hot one way is
if the drips and they'd see the drips
are kind of thick in there once it gets
hot the drips will loosen up another
thing you can do is listen to the dog
click click on the floor but you'd also
take a little sprinkle just get a few
drips of water on your hand and just
kind of splat you know just a few drips
not a handful of water just like a
couple drips of water and see if they
sparkle a little bit if they do you know
your oils hot so since I'm seeing that
the chicken is getting white around the
outside I'm actually gonna flip it at
four minutes instead of five minutes
because I don't want to overcook it
especially these smaller pieces smaller
pieces do cook faster than larger pieces
these pieces are pretty thick looks like
the croutons are done well it's so
pretty look how pretty these are gonna
be so good they've been cooking for
about the recommended amount of time but
it's very clear that these chicken
breasts are not done you can still see
the pink on the side there but I am
gonna take the small ones out they feel
nice and firm and I think that they're
done the ones that I added to the recipe
so I'm gonna go ahead take those out and
put them on my plate oh that was the
timer and then I'm just gonna take these
guys and I'm just gonna flip them back
over and give them like another minute
or two just to make sure they're done
okay so now they feel pretty firm and I
don't see the pink anymore they both
look really good I've gotten pretty good
at eyeballing chicken without checking
the temperature even though the safe
thing to do is to check the temperature
to make sure that it's good so now we're
gonna keep that pan nice and hot and
we're gonna move on to the last well
pretty much the last cooking well it's
Alaska things up and then there's the
plating step so we're gonna add two
teaspoons of olive oil again I'm just
gonna go rant just drop it in there and
I'm gonna turn down the heat a little
bit because I don't want my garlic to
burn and then I'm just gonna take my
garlic and I'm gonna drop it in and this
is really important to do this quickly
because garlic burns very fast trust me
I know from experience and just go
scrape up some of this they call it fun
that's the stuff that's those the the
leftover from the chicken feel like it
needs a little more olive oil I'm gonna
go ahead and just pour a little bit more
I err on the side of more and while this
is going I'm going to quickly read the
next step we're gonna do the cream and
the half the pasta cooking water I can
definitely smell that garlic cooking so
we're gonna go ahead and add the cream
before it burns it's already starting to
turn a little Brown I don't want that
then I'm gonna take it off the heat for
a second because I'm scared it's gonna
burn and half the cooking water I have
brought this down to exactly half a cup
so I'm gonna put a quarter cup in and
bring it back over the heat and then a
quarter teaspoon of salt and a quarter
teaspoon of pepper probably a little
less pepper than they call it four but I
don't like a lot of pepper in my food
and butter this has been sitting out on
the counter for a while so it's really
really soft and this is gonna be our
cream sauce
I mean homemade cream sauce really yep
really okay pasta in once it's boiling
which is definitely boiling and it's
been sitting here for a while I should
have put a little bit of olive oil on
the noodles but actually now that it's
in the sauce it doesn't seem to be it
seems to be okay I was a little nervous
that the noodles would stick together
but they're actually doing okay and this
is just gonna stand here long enough for
it to heat I'd like for the sauce to be
a little bit thicker so I'm gonna leave
it on the heat a little bit longer so
while that's heating will bring you back
over here and I'm going to cut up the
chicken
she looks beautiful beautiful beautiful
now as I slice the chicken I'm just
gonna set that into the pasta there's
some big piece of chicken I'll make sure
my husband and I get the big pieces now
I'm actually gonna measure this part
this is you're supposed to 1 teaspoon of
the lemon juice this is 1/2 teaspoon
measure so I'm gonna do two of those and
most of the bag of parmesan you're
supposed to take leave a little bit for
garnish so I'm just gonna pinch off the
corner here and just dump the rest in
okay so this is what we have left basic
the four bowls so child 1 child 2 and
then for my husband and I so I'm just
gonna sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese
of the rest that's there and then we'll
take the croutons and throw those on top
a lot of carbs in this one usually
there's a nice mix of vegetables and
carbs in me but this one is very card
heavy but again you can choose what you
like and what you don't like and what
you want what you don't want so if you
don't want one that's more carb heavy
then you wouldn't pick this one and then
a little squeeze of lemon on each one
and a little lemon zest make it look
extra fancy and we're ready to taste it
you think everybody's gonna like it I
think everybody's gonna like it I think
it looks really good this is my son John
who's my husband John and my daughter
well so she does don't be concerned it's
just marker it was career day she wants
to get tattooed so we're gonna go ahead
and try one thing I want you to know
it's very very important is that you
need to be honest just like mommy's
always honest in videos you need to be
honest about whether you like it or not
got it you think you can do that yeah
all right so let's go ahead and try it
I'm gonna see what you think all right
lots of bread on top here mm-hmm
that's a little bit hard six out of ten
why so low I could use a little all
right try to push on yet her tones are
supposed to be hard dude okay okay I
personally think that it's very good
that's great you're not a fan of them
cuz they're too hard you're being a
savage bro all right I really like
everything I think that it's very good
the sauce is super creamy and without
button
yeah she really liked the noodles I
really like to see well I think the
croutons are a nice touch they've got
you can taste a little bit of salt and
pepper on them even though I don't got
to put salt pepper exactly mom them but
somehow I guess they mix with everything
else but it tastes really really good
I'm really enjoying it the chicken of
course is very good as a salt pepper
chicken very easy and overall this was a
super easy meal to make I'm very
impressed with the the meal itself and I
really liked it I realized I'm blocking
my kid I cried she sat behind her but
you liked it kiddo
yeah what do you think today yeah you're
chewing you're talking about it's pretty
rare that you get food from there that I
don't like that yeah overall kids though
people could use a little basil a little
more salt nothing so overall kids are
just just trying my home chef in general
not with your mouth full
finish to what you're chewing but the
food that mommy makes from home chef
what do you think of it both overall
John what do you think overall of the
food that I make from home chefs wait
till you finished chewing chew with your
mouth closed so mostly a thumbs up to
the side kind of taking over a little
bit every once in while you're not a
cute jenna jameson man yeah and overall
I mean I feel like we just bumped off
the subscription to do in for me a
little weak because he really likes the
food so but yeah I have no intention of
canceling such anytime soon but yeah
thanks so much for watching this video I
hope you enjoy
and back to beauty contest on Tuesday
and Thursday this is unusual for me to
do you know a cooking video but I do
like to add and mix it out
