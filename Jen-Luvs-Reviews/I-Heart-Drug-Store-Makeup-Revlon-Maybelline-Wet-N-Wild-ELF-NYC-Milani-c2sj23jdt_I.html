has been a long time in the making about
three months ago Emily from lissette's
beauty tagged me in the eye heart
drugstore makeup products and I have
neglected to film it so today I am
rectifying this problem and i am filming
it so here it is there are eight
questions to answer and i'm going to
answer them as quickly as possible
because i don't want this to get
horribly boring alright so favorite
drugstore makeup brand is revlon um
closely followed by maybelline but
definitely gonna have to go with revlon
because of a couple products that i will
be telling you very soon favorite face
cheek and lip products favorite face
product is definitely my revlon
colorstay and i haven't tried the
whipped one but i do enjoy this one i am
finding though that it is a little too
much coverage for me so what I've been
doing is I have been mixing it with the
covergirl BB cream and kind of doing a
half and half putting these two together
and it ends up working perfectly
actually else I'll add this one to I
don't think that Revlon makes this
anymore but the age-defying moisturizing
concealer love this I'm going to be very
sad when I have to find a new one I've
heard that there are other formulas that
are close to this I think instant age
rewind is supposed to be very close to
this so i guess i will probably be
purchasing that after this is gone but i
do have quite a bit of this left i am
sad to say that i don't own any
drugstore blushes no drugstore cheek
products in my house and the reason why
is because i got that sephora in the
glow sampler kit and that comes with a
lot of cheek products a lot of G
products so I don't really need any
drugstore cheek products and that's
really the only reason why I don't have
any but for lip products this is this is
the other reason why i love revlon is
the fur lip products they'll revlon
kissable balm stains I'm in love with
these and I keep meaning to go get more
of these because I love them what I love
about the
is that they are not super pigmented I
don't like my lip color to be like paint
so I'll swatch these for you this this
one is in a door and I'll show you this
is the UM the revlon colorburst lip
butter and red velvet and show you the
difference in pigmentation there but you
can see like totally different right
totally different love them both but for
different purposes I would rather use
this for nighttime this for daytime the
other kissable balm saying that I have
is the one in honey and I'll swatch that
because you can kind of see the
pigmentation on that one again very
lightly pigmented on been giving this
one a lot of love I'm actually wearing
that on my lips right now love this
stuff and I have a tart um lipsurgence i
think is what it is and that is pretty
much the exact same formula in my mind
so we definitely rather purchase these
for half the price and then I do have my
Revlon lip butter and creme brulee and
this stuff is just really nice too so
you can kind of see that squatches for
Chi so i enjoy those revlon products i'm
a Revlon girl my two least favorite
drugstore products on this Milani I
shadow oh I cannot stand this eyeshadow
i am so I was so disappointed because
look how gorgeous that color is but you
swatch it and it's like there's nothing
there and look at this weird little
brush it's like the strangest I don't
even know what the purpose of that is
but you swatch it and there's nothing
I'm going to dig into it try to get some
product and it's like there's nothing
and then if you try to blend it it's
just gone it's horrible i did a pixie
eyeshadow review a long long time ago
and that was the same way as this just
horrible horrible quality i was so
disappointing this a lot of the drug
store stuff that I by that I don't like
I returned the NYC I'll put a picture
the NYC little eye shadows where you dip
the brush in and oh gosh those things
were awful i returned those those were
terrible i also have some a video of
some wet and wild products that i just
returned that's
okey video that I'll put a link at the
end of this video on a little bit more
of a positive note the best makeup
bargain definitely wet and wild the
eyeshadow palettes I've heard that the
single eyeshadows aren't as good as
these but I absolutely love this this
one is in comfort zone I want to buy
more of these but I really don't need
more eyeshadow but if i was going to
choose more eyeshadows to buy i would
buy these but these are just amazing the
pigmentation is just gorgeous I mean
just absolutely beautiful and they stay
on so well I mean I don't know swatch
these but just I mean absolutely
beautiful I don't know if you can see
those but just absolutely gorgeous I
mean they're just buttery and they stay
on all day long and oh my gosh I'll
swatch these on my hand hmm so that's
just one one swipe of those that's just
one swipe and they're just gorgeous let
me do that again so you can see it
double and look I mean just huge just
insane pigmentation and i love these
just as much as I love my Urban Decay
shadows my Urban Decay shadows of course
are so much more expensive definitely if
you don't have any of these I don't know
what you're waiting for go get them they
are cheap really cheap i think these
eight eyeshadows were like six dollars
hi my rain all right favorite underdog
product now please excuse the filthiness
of this i really need to wash this but
my ecotools brushes and these I these
have been loved these have been loved
and they have not been washed in a hot
minute so I apologize but these
eyeshadow brushes are stinking amazing I
use these every day and I don't see any
need to buy any other eyeshadow brushes
but these this one I pack all my color
on here and then I stamp in the corner
with this I blend it up into the crease
with this I use this for my brow bone to
belt blend anything extra i use this to
kind of detail in my outer V and then I
use this one for my lower lash line when
I do that and this is just the perfect
set and these things are so cheap oh
these are these are my Holy Grail
brushes and I never hear anything about
them this one is
ironic and it is drugstore products that
I feel are overpriced and this one is
when I just talked about in my discount
beauty haul video and is Maybelline eye
studio quads and I know people love
these things I got three of these for a
dollar fifty each at big lots or
something like that and I feel like
these are definitely worth a dollar
fifty i do not think they are worth ten
dollars I do not think they're nearly as
good as my wet and wild I shadows at all
but one of my subscribers who was just
my subscriber of the month for January
she says that some of these are even
better than these that these aren't her
favorites that I should try the other
quads but I mean if you just look at the
color selection and these like if I'm
getting a palette I want to get a
complete I look out of my palette to me
this is not an eye look okay to me there
is no dark shade here for if this is
going to be the darkest color it needs
to be darker than that I would probably
keep these three colors but then darken
this one up and make this one super a
super dark red and then I would have
loved this one so excuse my fingers put
them on my pants so so far my experience
with these is that these are overpriced
maybe it's just the ones that I have and
I know I'm Lizzie from Lizzie Josh just
just got this is irresistible iv1 she
did a tutorial on it look beautiful on
her I can't get the squirt for me
alright for drugstore dupes I don't I
tried not to do because I will see a
point in duping and except for to show
you that some things that do because if
I already have something why in the
world would I want another one that
makes no sense to me but I again in my
discount beauty haul I got these elf
eyeliners and I love my elf eyeliners
absolutely love them and these are
honestly this is a straight-up dupe for
my Urban Decay distortion eyeliner and
let me show you I am a sucker for
glitter like I love glitter on my eye
but just a little bit you know that's
why I love blue eye liners but can you
tell which one is which hmm okay this
one is the urban decay and this one is
the elf they look exactly
so score on that first super cheap and
super ridiculously expensive wish I'd
known that before i bought this one okay
so here's the black underneath can you
tell which ones which hmm top one is elf
bottom one is urban decay this one is
perversion and that's elfs black um can
you tell the difference noob and
honestly the elf is easier to put on the
urban decay is a little bit more on
watering so I would actually buy the elf
over the urban decay what so those are
the two dupes that I have and they're
pretty darn similar in my opinion so you
know yeah whoa score for elf alright so
don't get too excited about elf because
elfs got its drawbacks too and my over
number one most does not deserve the
height product is by elf and for me at
the contouring blush and bronzer
supposedly this is a dupe for NARS
orgasm and Laguna and I have NARS orgasm
and I have NARS Laguna and I do not
think it as they do because this one
does not last number one number two the
bronzer isn't so pigmented and it does
not blend it made this dark streaks you
have to be very very light handed with
it and even being light handed with it I
still didn't enjoy it the blush is
beautiful for about an hour and then it
seems to go away so for me this did not
work I know a lot of people love this
product I'm and I'm glad it works for
you it does not work for me I just want
to thank Emily so much for tagging me I
really appreciate it I hope I did the
tag justice I do love drugstore products
i do i love my hand products too but
they're definitely some really good
drugstore products and i hope you
learned about some of them today or at
least were validated or refreshed or
some kind of benefit from this video
