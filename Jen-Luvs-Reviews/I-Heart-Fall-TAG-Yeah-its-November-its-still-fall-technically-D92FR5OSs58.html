late to the game on this i'm almost so
late that the party is over i am going
to do the I Heart fall tab i was tagged
by the sets beauty and her name is emily
in real life and i keep meaning to ask
for Emily why did you name your channel
lasette beauty when your name is emily
because it's very confusing because I
called you list set for like the first
couple of weeks I was subscribed to but
anyway if you haven't seen Emily's
channel you have got to see this woman's
channel she does the best tutorials
that's like her thing she's really she
does a lot of her empties she's a lot of
empties videos but her tutorials are
amazing she literally I'm not even
kidding transformed herself into
Cinderella for Halloween I almost didn't
click on the video because I didn't
realize that it was her and I don't
really watch a lot of tutorials except
for Emily's of course but I recognized
her because she looked like Cinderella
ok I'm gonna have to put a clip right
here because it was amazing and you have
got to see this video but anyway so I so
Emily tagged me in the eye heart all tag
like forever ago so i'm gonna go ahead
and do that really quick all right
question number one what is your
favorite follow that product and for the
fall until like a couple weeks ago it
was my creme brulee lip butter until i
want to give away well i want a second
place in a giveaway it's lipstick was
given to me by Miss Chenery who also
does amazing amazing videos um and i won
this lipstick and it is by far my new
favorite and it is by mac and it is in
naked paris and that's on a 52 and it is
a luster let me show you how gorgeous
this color is ok it looks a little scary
but let me swatch it for you see it's
really not that scary this lipstick is
perfect for me because i don't wear a
lot of dark lipstick it kind of freaks
me out I'm very
so dark lipstick I feel like makes me
look like a vampire but this is really
really pretty on me and it is totally my
favorite lip product for fall absolutely
and matte lipsticks smells like
marshmallows so that's always a good
thing miss generally thank you so much
for this I absolutely love it favorite
fall nail polish and you're gonna laugh
because I just started getting back into
nail-polish I haven't really been in a
nail polish for many many years and I've
had this nail polish for like ten years
but it's my favorite fall nail polish so
I have to show you it's my favorite it's
a covergirl nail slips the color is
cherry brandy and I'm wearing it right
now I kind of show you what that looks
like it's like a very little bit of a
shimmer red nail polish I'll show you
that looks like I I can't throw the boy
unless they're gone or dried up or
something and if there are still good
colors I don't throw them away if you
happen to know the shelf life on a nail
polish and when it's like toxic for me
to put it on videos let me know in the
comments so that I don't you know kill
myself and toxify myself with these open
apology favorite starbucks fall drink
and I do have one of those I love
Starbucks I don't go there all the time
but when I do who they are especially in
the fall I get the salted caramel latte
but i always get it with half as much
have as many pumps and they look at me
like I'm insane like the syrup it's too
much sugar for me and this one guy
looked at me once and he was like are
you sure that's going to taste good and
I said yes I'm sure it's going to taste
good I have it all the time thank you
very much but I do that with all of my
my latte so if you're looking to cut
calories here and there you still want
your starbucks ask them for half as much
syrup and it cuts on your sugar on that
would be a good thing okay favorite fall
candle I haven't burned candles in a
while because I have small kids and
burning candles kind of a fire hazard I
really like the I have a sense a like
plugin and Mike
shun and I absolutely love my scentsy
plugin if you want any sense you let me
know my best friend sells them um if you
don't know what sense he is it's the
burner like you plug it in and it gets
really hot it's got a light bulb in
there it gets really hot and it melts
the wax so um I will tell you though
that my favorite scent is not sensing
zai didn't buy any false sense when I
load it up on my sensei I got this
actually at walmart or I think it was
like a dollar in change and it's it's
really kind of grubby looking because
it's been in my kitchen for a while but
it's called a warm autumn welcome and
it's by better homes and gardens and
they had a whole display at walmart of
these and this one smells amazing i only
have two left but I've use them all but
it's um really cinnamon like a cinnamon
apple kind of snow and I love this one
okay favorite fall accessory I think I
don't know I I'm really bad at
accessorizing I have to admit this I'm
really bad I don't know if you guys are
good at accessorizing if you are maybe
you can help me because I stink at it
especially like buying scarves I never
know how it's about i want to buy
scarves but i don't know what's gonna
match my clothes so I don't end up
buying any and it's sad because I don't
want to end up with a scarf like the one
that I own that I never wear because I
don't know what to wear it with so but i
do love earrings i got these at Kohl's
and they're just like basic Brown like
hoop earrings and they're very simple
and ordinary but I love them because
they match everything haunted house
haunted hayride or haunted corn maze I
know I'm so late on these um anything
where there's no one jumping out and
scaring me I'm good I do not like to be
chased I do not like things jumping out
at me and trying to scare me i do not
enjoy that I don't understand it when
people enjoy being scared like I just
don't like it I ate it it's not fun for
me like at all so probably hayride is
the least likely to have someone jumping
out at me so I'll choose a right on that
one favorite Halloween movie
ah here we go I'll pimp my friend okay
my friend bet that I went to high school
with was in a movie called a sweet &amp;amp;
vicious beauty and it's an independent
flick and it was so good like it was
awesome yeah I went to go see it with my
husband and a couple of my friends from
high school and it was so good like you
can't get it anywhere because it's like
they're still looking for distribution
for it but if it ever comes out i will
let you know how to get it because it
was amazing i got to watch my friend bet
chop people's heads off for like an hour
and a half and it was fabulous like she
was so good it was just great and the
costumes were amazing it's a period
piece where they're like it's like a
Victorian kind of era and she like sucks
the souls out of dead people's heads
like it was just so independent and
fabulous and I would say that that's
movie is my favorite horn being right
now definitely I will go with a sweet &amp;amp;
vicious beauty if you can ever find it
anywhere favorite candy to eat on
Halloween anything chocolate love me
some chocolate um if I had to choose one
I would probably say kit kats what are
you dressing up for Halloween well
because I'm so Little Miss it's what
were you dressing up for Halloween um
for Halloween I for work I work in an
elementary school I was a rainbow and
I'll should put a picture of me with my
kids when we went out trick-or-treating
that night and then for outside work I
went to a party and I was a prisoner I
was wearing an orange jumpsuit and my
husband was an FBI agent who had
arrested me yeah and it was one of those
not appropriate for work outfits if you
know what I'm sayin what is your
favorite thing about fall my favorite
thing about fall is probably just
pumpkin everything I love pumpkin stuff
pumpkin pie pumpkin smells pumping all
those false smells are delicious and
then getting into things
giving I love seeing my family I don't
get to see my extended family but for
