I think I officially have an addiction I
have serious serious makeup I'm problem
and I need some kind of know you know
what I don't even want help with it
because it's kind of fun and I can't
like my addiction so let me just tell
you what happened with the beauty budget
for last month so let me know when some
you may not that I set up a beauty
budget for myself fifty dollars a month
that seems pretty reasonable right i
mean that's a lot of makeup to buy MPD
products to buy and a month so i said
this beauty budget and I didn't really
really really well for the month august
really well like I hit fifty dollars on
the dot I was like yes ok so then
September hints ok and this is what i
thought i was buying ok it's
mid-september and this is what i had got
this ten dollars because the way i
signed up for it ten dollars thirty
dollars for three months then i bought
this this is a glam bag another ten
dollars then I want on hautelook and I
got these from rain cosmetics got an
eyeshadow got this lip gloss and I got
this lipstick thinking I was done I was
at $53 all right I'm three dollars over
I'm not gonna kill myself over three
dollars it's okay three dollars not be
killed i forgot that i ordered this that
brings my total to then i discovered on
Facebook because Facebook has those
crazy ads on the side this thing called
sneak peek and on sneak peek they had
Real Techniques brushes and OPI nail
polishes I got to crackle OPI nail
polishes and I think like for real
technique brushes for thirty-three
dollars then it gets worse
then I saw on urban decay and I'm
ashamed I'm very ashamed but its magic
and let me show you the magic this is
how magical the vice palette is ready
watch oh it's like it's like you know
like an angel opened the box for me so
yeah 3 budget ended up being that's not
fifty dollars okay but it gets worse
could it get worse yes it can get worse
then I decided last week I September him
then I had a day off because of the
Jewish holiday so I was gonna go to all
the top it is my October money October
is already at this is serious this is a
problem like really really I have no
self-control well no I have no
self-control know something do you know
I'm talking about is anybody else have
this problem besides me like I watched
these beauty videos on YouTube and it
does not help because I see how much
makeup y'all have and all the other
people on my subscriptions have and it's
I want everything I want everything that
you will have because it's amazing and I
want to try it so yeah actually into
vent about that just so you know the
reason why I haven't been making videos
is because i was using my iphone to make
videos and when i did the update to iso
6 I can't use my iphone anymore with my
editing software so that delayed me for
like a week so I was thinking about you
I wanted to make a video i ended up
stealing my husband's camera which i
think is gonna even look better than way
better than my iphone
so in the end it's a good thing but
there was a delay because of that mad
