Joe I got too many boxes for you this
one I received for promotional purposes
and this one I bought because it's full
of chocolate so could resist this
chocolate is my favorite food so i got
this one for promo they just sent it to
me they just pick which box they want to
send me and they just send it to me and
they say review this one and this one is
the meany special number 6 and this is
the whole grain a box I did kind of peek
in here I peeked in both of them and in
the chocolate one I did open one and try
one because I could not resist because
it's chocolate it's not chocolate it's
cut out you know whatever so anyway
we're going to start with the whole
grain a box these work out to be about
30 bucks apiece and you always get way
more than thirty dollars worth of stuff
in here so it's really going to be
whether these are the type of products
that you would use how's my hair doing I
didn't do anything to my hair today some
you've asked me what my hair looks like
when i get out of the shower like do
anything to it this is what it looks
like this is the wave i actually had it
in a ponytail so it's like the flat at
the top and then the weave at the bottom
let's go ahead and get into what's in
here i'm just going to kind of go in
order the first thing on the list is the
Gwyneth natural oatmeal scrub bar and
this looks really really cool and it's a
hundred percent organic it's handmade
it's got natural ingredients like
oatmeal on rice bran and mung beans and
red beans and shea butter and oil and
all that good stuff I don't really use
like bar soaps that much but John does
my husband so I might pass this on to
him if it doesn't smell too girly I
would imagine it's no Gary oatmeal II
let's smell it and see what happens can
I smell it
it's got more of them it's got a dude
smell it's not really a chick smell it
smells a little like oatmeal II earthy
kind of smell so he doesn't like it
maybe I'll eat of it or something but or
divvy it on a tip if you haven't found
easy of yet by the way I'm not sponsored
it's really fun you get to get rid of
all the stuff that you don't want from
your subscription boxes and it's and I
have my stuff on there on there if
you're interested in divvying with me
and trading some stuff on herb clinic
rice bran powder so you mix up once poop
I'm assuming it's a teaspoon but it says
a spoon of rice bran powder with one
spoof of oatmeal black bean or brown
rice and an adequate amount of milk
until the mixture becomes relatively
thickened and evenly spread the mixture
over is your face okay so you take them
you take the rice bran powder and you
mix it in your oatmeal and then you put
it all over your face after and you
leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes wow wow
I can't see what I can you imagine me
with oatmeal like plums all of them
buffet that's funny boo town okay number
three is the pure best the dome I says
behind two percent concentrate up but
don't mine locks in moisture within your
skin gets rid of any residues caught up
in your pores we're inside the fine
lines nice along your contours
delivering an overall effect more
translucent and naturally glowing skin
do I want translucent skin not quite
sure about that because they won't you
be able to seal my veins
I don't want you to see my veins in my
blood going through my face cuz my skin
translucent turn into Baltimore over
here off do more research on this G
black dome i sees thing and see whether
i want to use that or not it's like a
liquid though it's like watery okay and
these are all full-size products by the
way this is the pure best black devices
eye cream so it's the same stuff but
this is the essence and this is the eye
cream much knows all you're seeing is my
mailbox thing over there I wish I could
get it so that you didn't have to see
that all the time but that's all I got
ok so my bed is right here so I can't
move the camera over alright let's see
what the deal is with this I love eye
creams though I don't know about that
other stuff but I love me some eye cream
that is huge for an eye cream this will
last me the rest of my natural life and
maybe beyond feels nice just boys rising
eye cream has a little bit of a low
shitty smell but nothing strong whoo
anything special about this no need for
an expensive high-end eye cream anymore
this affordable high-quality eye cream
but the same thing with that
translucence I don't want you see all my
veins under my eyeballs that'd just be
weird so i'll do some research on that
will do some research if you all know
anything about it let me know in the
comments alright next is a puter cuter
next is if you're doing can I speak next
is the pure derm anti-stress heat
therapy meal mask oatmeal BAM it looks
like shampoo yet anti-stress it's a heat
therapy mask relaxes your force to open
them up instantly so they could remove
any residues clogged up inside and
deliver deep nourishment and moisture to
your skin so it's got oatmeal extracts
jasmine ash extracts cactus and honey to
improve the elasticity and overall
complexion meet excited about that I'm
definitely keeping this one too so I'm
gonna open this one up
I don't like the paper maps but i'll use
me some other kind of masks smells like
soap though I was expecting more of an
oatmeal smell smells like King clean
soap go and eggs rice bran collagen
masks these will go to Mary Lynn my
friends who enjoys masks brains and
smooth is out your dull complexion for a
healthier glow and a five dollars each
rice bran extract collagen and vitamin E
the Pope cloth retains more moisture
helping pores to fully absorb pure derms
met beneficial ingredients nice Goku so
pass those along and then next on the
list number seven is the pure dermat
daily moisturizing hand mass oatmeal and
it said you get one pair for seven
dollars have fun I believe this there's
not on my face so it's a glove type mask
it locks in moisturization and it's
oatmeal and shea butter and I get dry
patches especially on my knuckles and I
don't like it so I'm definitely going to
be using that that's exciting and then
the last thing in here is an
invigorating foot scrub and it's a
walnut one interesting so you just I
guess you just rub it on your feet it's
a blend of walnut shells apricot seeds
they work together to gently exfoliate
and soften rough dry and cow skin on
your feet says you can also use them on
your elbows in your knees nice cool so
excited about that yay so things I'm
most excited about in here are the foot
scrub I'm excited about the hand mass
unexcited about the face mask this I'm a
little weirded out by but will will work
with it what we'll see how it goes I
might have to just try it just for the
fun of it for the for the excitement of
trying something new I got I'm gonna
step out of my comfort zone and I'm
going to try it I'm a little scared but
I'm going to try it and then these I'm
going to have to just do more research
on to see whether they're really truly
make my skin trans
yes I'm not super excited about but
that's just a personal preference thing
and then these is another personal
preference thing that I give to my
friend on my face mask so overall again
I feel like this mini box definitely has
all of the components of an amazing way
more value than what you pay for Fox and
that's a lot of interesting things that
you would never see in the u.s. I mean
where where would you see these nowhere
nowhere it's just it's so interesting to
see what they put in here because it's
marketed to a Korean audience and you
know they just market things differently
and I think that's really great to see
something like that it's very refreshing
alright moving on to the chocolate box
again I already open this whole bit
because I couldn't help it could not
help it and the first thing I opened
well oh I got chocolate on the card oh
it smells so good oh this is the pure
smile choosy lip scrub in chocolate and
it came in this package here but this is
the actual product and that cute and
then it says it's a lip scrub but it's
very very smooth there's no scrub eNOS
to it it's just this brown color and
it's very moisturized and it smells like
chocolate which makes it even more
amazing but I mean nothing like out of
the ordinary but it definitely smells
good says sugar cow extracts beeswax
shea butter ho ho oil macadamia oil
removing dead skins deeply nourishing
and adding extra luster to dry chapped
lips yes that is what I need in my life
Oh bamm-bamm this is the attitude house
milk talk and it is a body wash and it
smells like chocolate and also you can
put in your bath as a bath milk and make
a chocolate milk bath how amazing is
that I'm gonna take me a chocolate milk
bath how just oh ho ho doesn't get any
better than the chocolate milk bath I'm
telling you goodness all right now the
Wonder a chica cowl brightening mask
where are you right here looks off then
see the packaging soap ready look at
I it's like chocolate sauce in a tub and
it smells like chocolate sauce straight
up chocolate sauce no joke oh look and
it looks like chocolate sauce I wonder

at you dare me I'm not doing it yeah he
thought I was gonna like it didn't you
cleanse away all the dirt and Curie's
piled up in your pores also looks feels
and smells exactly like real chocolate

read that because i was going to
avoiding iron lip area is no problem but
i'm telling you that looks like fudge
like straight-up budge mmm okay this is
the pure smile essence mask and
chocolate milk chocolate milk mass rich
and milk protein nutrients cacao extract
vitamin E and collagen work to hydrate
and smooth out uneven skin texture I may
actually have to use this mask this may
be a first for me for from a while ago
when the last time I used one of these
and I was completely horrified but this
one's made of chocolate so therefore I
may have to try it alright next we have
the vitamin cleansing dessert look at
that cute little box oh my gosh avis
vitamin cleansing dessert magic cream
soap in coconut and cacao just it's just
a cleanser nothing fabulous in the
description nothing notable wash this
one that smells a little more like fake
chocolate it's like wiki and I'm having
trouble getting some off on my finger
there it's very creamy but still smells
amazing smells more like a chocolate lip
like fake lip products where this one
the other one smelled like straight-up
chocolate sauce so that is exciting as
well oh my gosh I can't believe only

I'm excited about everything there isn't
a single thing in here I'm not excited
