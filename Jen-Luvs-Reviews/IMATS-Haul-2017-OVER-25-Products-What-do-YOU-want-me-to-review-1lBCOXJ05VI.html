I am so excited and I'm so sad for the
people that are wearing headphones
I'm really sorry for doing that to you I
apologize so as you may or may not know
I was at IMATS in New York this past
weekend and if you were wondering if you
are subscribed to my channel and you're
wondering where the make up news was
this week past weekend I can't do the
make up news while I'm traveling it's
just too much of a production it's not
possible so that's why we didn't have a
full new show if you ever want to know
what's happening with the news just
watch the episode previously at the very
end or look in the video description
aisle it'll either be one place or the
other place or both but let's go ahead
and get into what I bought at IMATS and
the reason why I'm doing this it's not
just to show you what I got but it's to
get your opinion about what you want me
to focus on for review if you really
like something you're really interested
in something leave it in the comments
below so that I know that you are super
interested in it so let's go ahead and
get into what I got so the first thing
is I'm wearing a couple of things on my
face right now the first one is these
eyelashes and these are violet Voss
lashes these are in the style just
slayin and they were relatively easy to
put on they have a not super thick band
but not a thin band but they kind of
look like eyeliner when you put them on
so you could probably skip eyeliner if
you really really wanted to and just put
these lashes on so far I do really like
them but again I just got them so I
can't really tell you much more than
that
I'll go into the other eyelashes that I
bought I bought two pairs of sugarpill
lashes these were actually very
inexpensive I was very surprised I got
the style st. and I got the style
Lullaby believe it or not these were two
of the more natural looking lashes that
they have these are called crazy for me
I like the more natural lashes I'm still
kind of a natural girl at heart so it's
kind of hard for me to step out of my
comfort zone so that's why I bought
these speaking of sugarpill I did get
one of their new lipsticks this is in
the shade anti socialite it's the
lightest one again believe it or not of
their new collection
and it's really dark but this is the
lightest one that they had and it really
called to me when i swatched it
and i bought one for me and i bought one
for my friend Meredith so I'm excited to
try that as far as set let me smell it
real quick doesn't smell like anything I
do want to mention the other thing that
I am wearing and that is the dose of
colors liquid lipstick in the shade it's
one of their new shades if you saw my
monthly favorites video the dose of
colors liquid lipsticks were at the very
top of the countdown they have become
one of my favorite liquid lipstick
formula is one of three favorites No and
I really like these a lot
speaking of dose of colors I did get a
couple of other things I got the
marvelous mom's eyeshadow palette and
I'll see if I can get this open without
spilling anything it does come with a
dual sided brush there's a pencil brush
on one side and kind of a fluffy
flattish kind of brush on the other side
and it's maulvi kinds of shades and I
just thought they were really pretty and
the last time I got a palette that looks
something like this it was a Becca one
they didn't like it at all and I was
very disappointed in it so I'm hoping
that they come it through for me as far
as quality so it's cruelty free paraben
free and talk free just so you know also
from dose of colors I got two of their
ideal duo loose pigments and primer
these are relatively new I remember them
being in the news show I've got this
shade shell which is like a peachy like
champagne e peachy kind of shade then I
got the shade lemon drop with just like
a crisp lemon yellow and I'm very
excited about this i swatched these and
I was like oh yeah I have a lot of
trouble picking which shades I wanted
but I thought all over the lid maybe
even single shadow colors you know with
liner and lashes like even liner and
mascara and the way that these things
work is there is a cream shadow on the
top a cream base and then there's a
loose powder on the bottom so you can
use one or the other or you can use a
combination of both however you like to
do it which I thought was really cool so
I got two of those I did not mention a
couple other violet Voss products that I
got I got one of their newer
highlighters it's called glow with the
flow and I am
that on my cheeks today I found it to be
accentuating of pores so be careful with
that but I also found it to blend into
the skin very nicely but if you have a
large pores you may want to pass on this
if you don't it's really nice that you
can make it really super poppy and shiny
or you can blend it in it's got this
like dropper thing but I didn't even
really have to use the dropper because
it's coated with so much product and I
just kind of dotted it onto my cheeks
and I really enjoyed it
today's the first day I've used it and I
really liked it also from violet boss I
got one of their cosmetic glitters and
this is in the shade number 10 Goldy I
was standing next to this one woman and
we were talking about then we were both
trying to decide which ones that we
wanted she got a mermaid one and I got
this one but it's got these beautiful
complex gold and blue and orange and
green sparkles and then I just thought
it was really pretty so I got that too
so this is a brand that I hadn't ever
heard of and I actually ran into I'm not
sure why camera if he said he was the
CEO or he's basically pretty high up in
this company I ran into him on my way
into the show and we struck up a
conversation he's like stop by my booth
I gave him a business card and he was
kind enough to give me a few products to
try so this brand it's called g4e Beauty
this is their lip gloss in the shade
saline and I don't know much about it
yet I haven't used it it's got a very
mild plasticky kind of scent to it and
it is a little bit opaque it looks like
it'll be a nice topper over another
lipstick or like a nice wash of color
it doesn't feel sticky or heavy at all
just by putting it on my hand but and I
haven't used it yet so the next thing
they gave me was the classic matte
lipstick and this is a matte one and
it's in the shade daydreamer and it
looks like this very pretty nudey pink
and looks like that more Barbie pink
swatched on the hand again just a very
mild lipstick II kind of plastic and
kind of scent but it's not offensive in
any way it's not strong and then another
lip gloss in the shade yo Co SEO so I
guess feels a little bit thicker it's
like a nuni shade which I love
like these shades as lip glosses because
they're nice to lighten up other colors
actually I'm going to put this over the
dose of colors to see how it changes it
hopefully they play well together we'll
sing
I don't know if it lightened it up a
little bit or not I can't really tell
much difference as far as the shade
changing at all I just feel a little
glow seer it does feel very nice and
comfortable on the lips though I'll say
that it definitely doesn't feel heavy or
sticky so I'm looking forward to trying
these just a little bit more white my
hand before I get this all over my jeans
hi dee dee was also kind enough to give
me one of her lip glosses this is the
forever lips in the shade blase and it's
very similar actually to the one that I
just put on as far as the shape ooh
again just more of like a lipstick II
kind of scent this feels more like a
liquid lipstick it's a little bit more
opaque so I'm very very curious to try
that while we're talking about lips
let's go into OCC I purchase these from
them I got two of their lip tars I
haven't tried their lip tars since they
were in the old packaging the little
squeezy tubes so I wanted to try them I
got this shade called artifact it's like
a metallic bronze and this shade is
called dash and that's just a nudey pink
like how many of these do I need I don't
I just want to make sure I can use it
and I do try it I'm trying it to test a
formula so I want to make sure it's a
shade that I'll use I also got their lip
tar primer because I was curious to see
whether this was hydrating whether this
could be used under other liquid
lipsticks things like that and I was
just I was just super curious so I cut
this too
this brand is called Miss adoro and they
gave me this nice little cute gift bag I
thought that was so sweet so what I did
was I just walked up and I introduced
myself and I smiled and I said you know
I have a youtube channel I told them
about the news show I gave them one of
my business cards no ago let me give you
some stuff so it wasn't like I was going
around hey can I try some free product
hey can I try some I wasn't doing that
it's okay for people that are gonna
judge me please don't be upset with me
for companies giving me things I still
want to show you okay don't be judgy all
right take your judgy put it in your
pocket save it for later because no one
needs it here alright but anyway miss
adore oh this is the 3-piece beautiful
brow gel kit and this is another
I'm wearing that I forgot to tell you it
is a lot like the honest doggy a dip
brow but it's creamier than the dip brow
which makes it just a little bit harder
for me personally to work with you just
have to be very careful with how much
you use because this is some oat and
stuff girlfriend or boyfriend so I've
used this twice and so far really really
enjoying it what I found was I just put
a little bit on my brow right here and
then i spool eed it through my brow and
that's all I truly needed a little bit
sometimes a little bit more just in the
center just to make sure I was
completely full in there but so far
really enjoying this and it does come
with a dual ended brush thingy here so
you've got like a brow a brow brush here
and a spool here and then you get this
really nice highlight crayon so one side
is matte and the other side is shimmery
so depending don't kind of look you're
going for you'll use one or the other I
use the map today I use the shimmery the
other day and I really like it the rest
of things in here I have not used yet
this is a pair of their lashes in it's
just a J and then an apostrophe and an e
so je it is 100% human hair so just so
you know that is what this is they are
made in Indonesia and then they gave me
a long-lasting wear gel eye pencil and
this does have a little cruelty free
little bunny on there it's not the
leaping bunny I think it's the PETA
Bunny the one that's got the little
bunny ears this is in the shade of
velvet which is a matte black I'll
swatch that real quick very creamy very
creamy but I haven't put on my eye
shadow feel like I'm sweating over here
then they gave me a lipstick in the
shade man-eater and it is this bright
red it isn't a super orange --red which
i really like but i don't see it as
really being blue base either it's just
like a true red with a red red like it
reminds me of like a pin-up girl kind of
red it's very very pretty and then this
is the super matte lip paint what is
going on here come out I tell you this
is the shade smoking hot nice I love
this shale of these purpley shades
it's got a very light minty kind of
scent to it smells really good it smells
like a mint lip balm very very nice
agape love girl okay Maria and I have
known each other for ever since the days
of keek that's where we met each other
years ago well she works with MBA
cosmetics and she designed her own
eyeshadow collection so it's these loose
mineral shadows and you get ten shadows
in the set and this is her own
collection it's called the vintage
romance collection and I will put a
picture of it there so that you guys can
see it but I haven't ever tried their at
loose shadow so I'm excited for that she
also gave me this right here this is one
of their foil fix and glitters called
Holy Grail oh I just watched this for
you look see how it doesn't come out
it's not like that kind of glitter but
you can feel it it is gritty glitter and
it looks like this and then you swatch
it and holy go Jolie what what she also
gave me a little bit of this glitter
foil and liner FX so you're supposed to
put this under there so you don't get as
much fallout so that is for that so I'm
really excited to play with this and use
this Thank You Maria I'm like trying to
wipe it off and it's not coming off my
hands nice okay this is champagne wishes
and it's violet it's a loose glitter and
they gave me a little bit of their
glitter glue to go with it if you've
ever tried let I love to know your
thoughts in the comments below I tried
to go by and see Samantha Riley but I
happen to keep missing her so I didn't
get to give her a hug but she was at the
lit booth and that was why I stopped by
but then as I was there but they gave me
one of these which I thought was really
nice of them la splash was also kind
enough to give me one of their brand new
foundations this is in the shade cashew
and look at this it's a little Bowl and
inside is your foundation right there
and this one does match me pretty well
it is a little bit yellow tone but I
think I can pull it off I do okay I
didn't wear it today we'll see I've only
use it once so I definitely want to be
using it more the balm also
nice enough to around out my the bomb
collection for my the phone brand review
that's coming up they gave me the
highlight and contour palettes you
haven't seen this it is beautiful I have
been using it just a little bit I'm
starting to form some opinions on it you
get all these highlight shades and then
you get these bronzer and contour shades
and a blush shade down there which is
cool it's like a bandit or thing they're
their packaging is so cute and then
their photo bomb powder foundation I
wore this yesterday as a foundation so
I've got some beginning opinions on this
this is the shade light and this one
matches me pretty nicely but it doesn't
match me right this second because I
have something else that I have to show
you that I did purchase at full price
because the guy that sold this to me was
so good he was so cute and I just wanted
to give him a hug because he was so
adorable and he totally sold me on it
and I got it so this is the Roxanne
rizzo New York bronze glow and this is
basically an at-home spray tan so what
you do is you take this off you shake it
up and I just take off all the top part
and then I just go che and y'all know
how much I don't like to put things on
my face I don't like to spray things on
my face I was really nervous about this
I was nervous it's gonna seep into my
fine lines oh no it was all wonderful
and it smells like cherry almonds it
smells so good because this is the thing
all right with me and tanning just a
little backstory when I was a child my
family we kind of had a competition of
who could get the tannest okay we
started with SPF 6 that was what we put
on and then we went to Ford then we went
to 2 then we went to nothing and then we
laid on the baby oil okay it was like
tan was beautiful that was the way that
I grew up in that kind of house so in
the summer time I always have trouble
putting on sunscreen mentally because I
feel like I want to get a little bit of
a tan and I know I'm not alone there I
know that it's bad and I'm fully aware
of this but it is something that I've
had a really hard time breaking mentally
and I am an adult I can make my own
decisions but it's something I've had
trouble with so I feel like this is
really going to help me to stop doing
that
put on my sunscreen fully because I feel
like this is easy enough to use and fast
enough that I won't need to go into the
Sun and feel good not need but I won't
have that strong desire to go into the
Sun to get a tan I've tried so many like
lotions and creams and sprays and stuff
before it always ends up on even or it's
splotchy or something and I just I don't
like them I've tried so many different
kinds from inexpensive ones to really
expensive ones and I hate them and this
one seems like it's going to be perfect
for me I used it today and then of
course the very cute adorable gentleman
sprayed it on me at IMATS and I was sold
so I'm looking forward to using this
more and I'll keep you posted on how I
like it just a couple more things I have
never tried obsessive compulsive
cosmetics nail polishes so I got three
well if you count that I got there
lacquered topcoat and then I got the
shade john doe and the shade scrubs not
a great name for this scrubs it looks
just like sprouts I love it I love it
and the last thing that I'm super
excited about are these naked Cosmetics
loose iridescent powders and the way
that these work is you can lay them over
a white base or a black base and they
give you this beautiful iridescent look
this many different shades there's a
yellow there's a purple there's a pink
there's more of a white there's like a
green there's a blue so I'm super
excited about this because I'm a huge
fan of Nicky Cosmetics single loose
eyeshadow they come in like a stock I
love them I have a whole little bag of
them and I'm obsessed so this is one
that I needed to add to my life I
decided to just get one stack they had a
deal for - but I had self control and I
just got one so that is it for my IMATS
haul please leave your thoughts and
ideas about what I should focus on for

will try to fit in your favorite so I
