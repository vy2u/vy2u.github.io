joining me once again at Jen loves
reviews I have a very special video to
share with you and it is my I'm at all
and reviews all kinds of good stuff now
I have a little sad story for you I have
already shot this once and I thought
that I was good and I had some issues so
I have to reshoot so I don't have some
of the packaging that I had originally
had in the video but the good news is is
I've used some of the products a little
bit more so I can give you a little bit
more of a review I know a lot of people
have been asking me about my time and
I'm act and what I did and who I met and
all that so I'm gonna clued that in this
video as well first things I a couple
people that I met on Saturday I met
Adriana Pina who is one of my good
friends on keek I've got to finally meet
her I'm at the ladies from glam moms i
met kate the redhead I met Sanders all
their channels will be down below if i
miss somebody i'm so so so sorry on a
Sunday morning because we had Sunday
tickets out there about 10 minutes
before 10 and then when we got in I
immediately saw Marlena from makeup geek
TV and if you don't know her Channel and
you love tutorials you definitely need a
head over to her Channel she's actually
my inspiration for starting this channel
the inspiration for starting this
channel she is the only one that i was
watching back when I started this
channel I really had to tell her how
much I appreciate her and how happy I am
for her successes she's exactly the way
what I would have imagined her to be
she's fantastic she's just the way she
is in her video she's wonderful after
meeting Marlena headed to my one major
stop that I wanted to go to which was
inglot my friend Laura over at mrs.
little anna loves inglot so I said you
know while I'm here I'm definitely gonna
get me some inglot so I went over and I
did a 10 pan palette while I was there I
met a wonderful young lady named
Stephanie who helped me to build my
palette now even though she didn't have
to I picked out nine shadows and they
come in these little black box so you
can see the shadows she took out every
single one of the shadow
that i had so that i could figure out
which shadow i was missing from my 10pm
college so i just thought that was
really sweet of her so thank you
stephanie for doing that now i don't
have that pal to show you but i'm going
to tell you that story at the end that
is my big tragedy of the trip you know
that makeup problems you know i'm saying
i went from Inglot got my temp pimp out
was really excited over to glamorous
chicks and glamorous chicks is where i
met Aisha and Aisha was awesome she was
so excited about the products at
glamorous checks she showed me how they
work the idea behind the pigments at
glamour's chicks is very unique you know
a lot of times you can take pigments and
you can wet them and change the formula
love them but with the glamorous chicks
ones for whatever reason I don't know
whether other shadows do this or not but
this is the way they market them is that
they can be used six different ways
eyeliner and they can be a powder
eyeshadow they can be a cream eyeshadow
they can be a lipstick you can make them
into a blush if they're the right color
and Aisha had this gorgeous red glitter
on her lips and it just looked beautiful
so she sold me on three of their
pigments and I actually don't have those
to show you either and again I'm going
to tell you that story that big tragedy
in a moment after hitting up the
glamorous chicks I was walking by a
stand and my new friend Maria pulled me
in and she started straightening my hair
basically she just kind of grabbed my
hair and was like you know what you know
how did you do your head this morning
and I said I straighten it and she's
like you straightened it and I'd like I
I straightening she like I think you
need a new straightener was like oh I
like my straightener I don't know that I
need a new trainer she said well you
know how long you've had and i said i
don't know like six or seven years she's
a girlfriend he's like you got it you
got to change that thing out over three
or four years so she starts trading my
hair and my hair looked gorgeous and
this is the box and it is the what's the
name of this the galaxy collection i
think the galaxy print of it and how she
really got me was she gave me this
little cars it's a lifetime warranty so
basically you have ever have any issues
with your straightener or if you just
want exchange if it's been a couple of
years and you want to exchange it they
will exchange it at no charge I think
you can buy these but she actually just
gave it to me which was really cool of
her how pretty this is isn't that
gorgeous it works fabulously and I
I'm still trying to figure out what heat
setting I can put it on like the minimal
amount of food really excited about the
strain are very happy with it and we
might be doing some collaborations in
the future Maria and PYT and me
definitely check these out if you're in
the market for a new straightening iron
I think they have other styling tools as
well so i'll put their like down below
the Maria is actually from a company
called ID looks so I somehow PYT I look
somehow they're linked I'm I guess maybe
I the luck sells the PYT straighteners I
don't know next thing I had that was a
wonderful experience was going over a
meaning palm over at Eve pearl now I've
seen a pro products on hautelook
numerous times have never bought any of
them because I don't hear anything about
them so I was like I'll no other stuff
is good or not and I'm not trying to
spend all that money on stuff my own
team anovas good but palm kind of pulled
me in put me down in the chair she asked
me if she could take my foundation off
to my foundation off tried on the
foundation the concealer a couple of
other products the blush and I was like
yes I am in love and I'm still in love I
got the foundation and it comes with two
shades and they talk about doing reverse
contouring so you put the dark shade
actually here and then you put the light
shade on your jawbone which I thought
was very interesting so I've been doing
that and I love it now one thing I was
really worried about with this is that
see how thin I don't know if you can see
how yep now you can see how thin this is
like oh my gosh that's not a lot of
product but you heart literally hardly
need any I just take my finger swipe it
go boom swipe it boom swipe it here bump
swipe it here boom so I be here bump
swipe it here bump and then i blend it
in with my brush and that's all I need
for my whole face and I am not kidding
the stuff lasts all day it is a
fantastic foundation she said you don't
necessarily have to use a powder i use
it with powder i really like it with
powder but was really happy about this
one product that she said that they're
very famous for is their salmon
concealer i love this as well i do i
feel like i have to blend this a little
bit more to make sure it doesn't skip
over my fine lines right here that i
have so i have to just make sure i get
in there really good to make sure it's
blended properly but once it's blended
properly it just looks beautiful so this
one here is really nice for lightening
my under eye if I want to and then this
one pretty much matches my
skin chunk by the way this one that I
have here is in fairlight and then the
foundation that I got is in light and
then I got one of their blushes and they
the way they do it is they do it all by
skin tone so you by either fair light or
light or medium or deep or whatever it
is and you just buy those products
across the board there's no guesswork so
if your cure if you're not sure about
those kind of things each pearl might be
a way to go so this is a blush trio so
that's how that looks inside and then
what she did was she took this brush
which of course I got okay so she took
this fan brush and she went side side
side and then sweeps it this way and
that way then you can take this deep
shade swipe it this way and then contour
a little bit take the light shade
highlight a little bit and I love this
blush another really long wearing blush
this blush lasts about eight to ten
hours which is a really long time for
blushes on me so really really happy
with this ok so those let me show you
the brush so that's how thick the brush
is and that's kind of how that goes
there and let me show you here I'm not
putting them in order sure about that ok
so even though these aren't the most
pigmented blushes in the world it kind
of makes them easier to work with and
like I said once you get it on there
like when I apply it it applies super
nice like it doesn't apply like I'm
looking at my hand swatches I don't feel
like it does this blush justice so
really happy with the e pearl products
that I got next stop was over it Julie
geez spy over with Jessie's Girl
cosmetics now I had the pleasure of
meeting at the Jesse of Jessie's Girl
and he was so nice I complimented him
specifically on the formula of there
they're called the gumdrop collection
there's sand polishes but they have the
perfect amount of glitter they have some
fine glitters and then they have some
little bit larger circular ism they are
just gorgeous they're my favorites and
polishes of all time and i am a nail
polish attic so and i have lots of i
have the zoo a ones i have the OPI one
and oh i have a l'oreal one julieg ones
are my favorite and he was like yes so
it was a really nice having a
conversation with him and possibly
Jessie's Girl
it was a woman that looked like it might
be his wife and I met julieg who was so
so so sweet and then rissrose to who I
was not familiar with but she's got a
ridiculous amount of subscribers so
y'all probably know who she is so she
was super nice as well didn't talk to
her as much because I wasn't quite sure
who she was at the time I feel really
bad about that but I didn't I end up
buying three polishes and an eyeliner
let me show you the polishes first I'm
actually wearing this color today just
one right here is this one here and this
is called bikini so bikini honestly I'm
not really happy with bikini it took
four coats for me to get this to opaque
it was very streaky to go on was not
happy with this one at all you know I'll
keep it because I love the color but it
was a pain in the butt to work with to
be honest do really like these though
these are shimmer polishes these are
clear to go on their topcoats this one
is gorgeous this one is like a goldish
yet gold it's very very finely milled
glitter though and it's really pretty
and it's called my private palace and I
would imagine this would be beautiful
over a white polish for a wedding this
would just be perfect so if you know
anybody that's getting married I would
recommend this one definitely if they
wanted to go with a white polish this
one here is also very pretty it's called
sugar rocks and it's just got some
iridescent glitters in there along with
some pink glitters and they're kind of I
don't know they're pretty decent sized
are not super chunky but you know normal
sized glitters but really like this one
and it does give a little bit of a pink
tinge if you put it over light enough
color you can tell the difference in the
color if you put it on one nail and not
another not a drastic difference but
enough to know the last thing I got at
the Jessie's Girl stand was another
winner and this is their eyeliner now I
just saw this on groupon I don't think
it's on there anymore but keep your eye
on groupon for jesse's girl products
this eyeliner is fantastic usually I do
my little tiny little flip away in here
and like I go like this one time I get a
little itch and my wing is gone doesn't
matter if it's my too faced one doesn't
matter if it's my cat bond Dean one
doesn't matter if it's my Mabel
lean1 they all just want and it's gone
but this one I swear is the first one
that I have ever used own cover girl to
have a cover girl 1 i've tried to steal
a one I mean none of them stay on like
this one does when I go like this my
wing stays and I am very thankful for
that so therefore this has been a really
really big win for me I haven't had any
problems with it drying out let me show
you a little swatch mhm and you can see
how thin of a line you can do or you can
make it thicker like that will blow on a
lift okay and then BAM really feel like
I need a makeup remover white for this
but I do love this it also doesn't seep
into my fine lines if you have aging
creepy lids this might be a good one for
you because it does apply so smoothly so
evenly so wandering around another
person that I had the wonderful pleasure
to meet was the beautiful Lizzy from
what would Lizzie do she is one of my
favorite subscriptions we've chatted a
little bit here and there about YouTube
and about you know the business end of
it and all kinds of things and she is
just such a sweetheart and I was just so
excited to meet her she is just as
fabulous in person as she is in her
videos she's just such a sweetheart and
just very open and kind like you don't
get that feeling like I got off of some
people that you know that you're not
worthy she has this air about her that
she understands that YouTube you know
having 90,000 or ninety six thousand
subscribers doesn't make her a more
valuable person in the grand scheme of
things and you can just tell that from
her you know she's asking people you
know oh you have a channel let me where
I let me put it in my phone we type it
down so I can check out your channel i
mean like she's just very genuine and
sweet and fun and she gave me a big hug
and it was just this you know wonderful
little meeting and I wish I gotten to
spend more time with her but maybe in
the future Lizzy and I will get to hang
out more because I think we would get
along there
well in person so I went over to this
place this royal and langnickel which
I've never heard of but supposedly they
sponsor a lot of bigger name youtube
they had a big line for jeffree star
like over by their booth so I think
maybe he's sponsored by them or
something oh no but I want to or touch
their brushes and they work just did not
feel good to me they had the brush sets
for twenty-five dollars and they were
just the fluffiest brushes like there is
no product sticking to those brushes but
there was one brush that I really wanted
to get and it's this one and it's one of
their natural hair brushes and this is
the first natural hair brush that I've
owned I don't know how I feel about that
I didn't really realize it was a natural
hair brush when I bought it but now I
have it so i am going to use it it's
called a line smudger it's bc 421 that's
how that looks there and i'll show you
kind of how it bends as it applied and I
wanted this brush for my crease for just
getting a little bit of color on this
point putting it in my crease and then
blending it out and it does work
perfectly for that the other brush
company that i visited was outer beauty
from within these ladies were so so
awesome i went over to their brushes and
I was like wow these remind me of my it
cosmetics brushes which is a big deal
when I first shot this video they were
not dirty but I've used them since then
so you know so L over an outer beauty
showed me this brush first I was looking
for a new foundation brush because I
noticed with my Beauty Blender it
doesn't it doesn't give me the opacity
that I want so sometimes I want a more
full coverage look and I needed a good
brush for that I do have the Real
Techniques expert face brush with work
which works for a lot of people it come
it's very streaky for me for whatever
reason I don't know if I'm using it
wrong or whatever but love and love and
loving this brush by outer beauty this
is the tapered kabuki brush it is f-106
i'll show you close ups of these in a
minute now they had a four brush set
which of course I threw away the
packaging I'm sorry about that that came
with also the round kabuki this is the
f100 and I use this today to apply some
mineral foundation and it works like a
dream
this one is the angled kabuki if the
f-104 I have not tried this one yet I
don't know why and also I haven't tried
this one yet this is the flat kabuki at
f-102 so this is the tapered kabuki how
that bends this is the flat kabuki look
how dense that is just beautiful and
they're so soft this is the angled
kabuki how thick density there and then
this one is the round kabuki and I don't
I don't know how much they are at
regular price but I did get those I
think they were like thirty-five dollars
for all four brushes which was amazing
also because i spent over thirty five
dollars they also gave me this and
please forgive me i can't remember the
name of it i will put it here but this
is an exfoliator sponge and it is an all
natural sponge made out like some kind
of special Japanese potato or something
and this thing is awesome i love this
thing i use this with my cleanser every
night feels really good i don't know if
it does all the things things that
claims to do but it is really fun to use
and i'm really enjoying this when this
one dies i'm definitely going to be
considering getting another one just
because it feels so squishy and soft on
my face and suppose it's got all kinds
of benefits but you can go to their
website I'll link it down below to check
out more about this sponge because it is
really neat so here comes a tragic story
so we went to leave we were done and got
in the car and I said you know I want to
build my angle a pallet so i'm looking
through my stuff look through myself my
angle at palate is gone the whole bag is
just gone so of course i get all upset
i'm starting to cry like you know this
was the one thing that I wanted and I'm
just like freaking out so I was like
okay can I ask my husband I was like
just drop me off i'll go in i'm gonna go
try to find the bag of course it's going
to be gone I mean of course it's gonna
be gone so I'm walking around asking all
the different booths visiting all the
friends that I
made along the way and nobody has that
nobody's seen it so I'd also have my
glamorous chicks eyeshadows in it so
super super sad about that went back
over to inglot saw Stephanie again she
tried to look up in the computer what
shades i got and couldn't find it so we
tried to rebuild it and I did repurchase
it so this is the palette that I mean
and i'll show you what i did and the
logic behind it oh this thing is like
dude on here so these were five dollars
apiece I think that they're usually
seven apiece I'm not gonna swatch them
all today because it takes forever and I
don't need 35 minutes of footage again
the idea behind what I did was I wanted
some spring light colors from my lid and
then I wanted some contouring you know
crease colors to you know darken up my
crease and add some contrast so I feel
like I kind of did that I don't know the
numbers off hand for these because
they're pretty impossible to take out
once you put in which I learned sadly
but the only bust I think in this one is
that I put these two and I feel like
they're both very very similar but
overall I'm really happy with these
shadows so far really loving this green
one if I can find all the shades i will
put them down below the other thing that
happened was i could not remember two of
the shade so i added these two grades
and then a few days later i got an email
from Stephanie and Stephanie said that
she found my order and she's going to
send me the two shades that I was
missing which I thought was super super
stinking cool the ladies from glamorous
chicks are also going to send me
replacements for the shadows that I lost
I do have a feeling that my bag was
stolen I'm pretty sure I remember
putting it into one of these big IMATS
bags and it was just setting on top
sitting on top with the handle sticking
out and I think well I was shopping
someone just walked by and just grabbed
it out and I didn't notice because I had
all my bags I'm pretty sure that's what
happened which really sucks that
somebody would do that but you know I
mean you can't control other people and
I believe in karma Oh one person I
forgot to tell you that we ran into at
the the place we hung out with on
Saturday night and in the daytime over
IMATS was Casey homes and I don't want
to talk to Casey homes that much but her
boyfriend or fiance fiance cases fiance
was really fun to talk to we end up
spending quite a while talking to him he
has a channel I'll go ahead and link
that down below but if you don't like
guns or blowing things up you probably
won't like it very much but I'm he was a
really nice guy so I'll put that down
below as well his name was Colton
