it yesterday yesterday oh my gosh I did
a live stream yesterday with this new
YouTube format and OH
it goes live really really fast so now I
know as soon as I hit that button I need
to start talking hi everyone welcome to
my second live stream this week well
third if you count Sunday I'm doing a
lot of live streams this week because I
have so much to share with you and I
just don't have time to put out all that
edited content tomorrow my collab with
Emily Noelle 83 is going live and I'm so
excited but I'm nervous because it's not
done and she's almost done and I'm not
done and I'm hoping it's done and I have
a busy evening when my kids get off so
I'm hoping I can get it done I think I
can no I can't even if I have to stay up
late I will get it done
it will be up we agreed on 2 p.m. her
time so that's 3 p.m. Eastern is what we
agreed on hi everybody oh my goodness I
love that there's so many people here so
fast ok so let's get right to the
nitty-gritty I am gonna say really
quickly hello to the people that were in
here first Sarah and amber B and amber M
and Hannah and Bobbi and Sal and
Courtney at fear and Nick's and Shane
hello and Kristen and Anna and Caden and
Michelle and mom and Shana and if I
didn't say hello to you hello to you I'm
gonna try to keep this as little chatty
as possible because I want this to be
kind of a faster livestream unlike
Sundays when we like kind of sit and
hang out and talk so if I don't um read
your comment on camera I'm gonna go back
and watch this on the replay and I will
read all of the things that you have to
say so first thing I wanted to show you
which was my impulse buy is my new halo
hair extension so if you watched what's
on a minute remember from yesterday Jen
breathe covert Oh Jen okay I'm just
really excited sorry I talk fast when
I'm excited so I got a halo hair
extension I was walking by a booth I'm
trying to remember then the booth that I
bought of that but it's not the same as
the brand of hair that I got and she was
like hey come here do you want to try
extensions and I was kind of like yeah
actually I do you know usually when
someone calls me over like in the mall
I'm like no thanks I'm good but I've
been wanting to get a halo hair
extension for a long time if you know me
you know that I don't like my hair it is
very very thin when I did the the halo
beauty
a review that was what I was hoping what
I kind of saw some results in I don't
think I don't know if they were results
was like the the voluminous nosov my
hair I don't know man
I really don't know but but anyway I
still don't like my hair and I'm not on
halo Beauty anymore and I know that a
lot of people had I'm not trying to slam
Halo in any way I know a lot of people
have seen a lot of results and you can't
expect one product to do everything for
everyone and it just didn't work for
what I wanted it to work for that
doesn't mean it's not gonna work for
other people what they want it to work
for so it just didn't work for me but
anyway so so anyway so I got this halo
hair extension because I am very
self-conscious about the thinness of my
hair the two things if you want the
things I'm most conscious about are my
forehead wrinkles my neck wrinkles here
and the thinness of my hair so without
further ado let me introduce you to my
hair this is my new hair this is what it
looks like so if you saw what stupid
makeup I was wearing it on there and it
is real human hair let me show you the
box it was the most expensive thing I
have bought in recent history it cost me
$400 and I cringed having them run my
credit card but knowing that this is
something I've thought about for a
really long time it wasn't really it was
an impulse buying that I wasn't
expecting to buy it IMATS but it's been
something I've been shopping for for at
least six months probably longer than
that so this is the Box the brand is
called she and it comes with a comb it's
called the flip and go by Shiloh hair
extension 100% remy human hair heavenly
hair instantly and the website is
www.seannal.com in hair does cost a lot
I think that's crazy
so so yeah and I won't read the whole
back of it but it is it says North
California North Hollywood California is
the the the location of the company but
yeah the stand was not that brand but I
did want to show you I know
all over the place today it does say she
on the inside and it's got the lace
there and I want to show you how I put
this on so that when you see my hair I
don't like I don't like people to think
that things are real when they're not
that's why I stopped using filters so I
just want to show you kind of how this
thing works so you put it on your head
like that there's like a little band
here if you see that little my hairs
popping up okay and then you take their
little hair pick and you just slowly
work around the edges and while we're
doing this I'm gonna go ahead and read I
know it was really expensive I know how
Shawna have you looked at Sally's I have
not I do have a Sally's where's my
closest Sally's my Sally's is I think
kind of over by my old house I think but
no I have not looked at Sally's but I
mean it's one of those things where I
know that real human hair is going to
cost a lot and I could have I could have
shopped around for a better deal I mean
that probably would have been the
smarter thing to do but you know I I
don't know I guess in that way it was
kind of an impulse buy but I really do
like it I mean she put it on my head she
was a really good sales person she put
it on my head she sat me in front of
mirrors away to look at it I tweeted out
about it I tweeted out about it and I
asked people on Twitter what they
thought and what pushed it over the edge
where you know was of course all of the
positive responses there were a few
people that said no but Jackie Ayanna
who I know is like an expert in this
stuff she said that she thought it
looked good on me so I was like okay if
Jackie thinks it looks good with all of
her knowledge and expertise then this is
something I should probably get okay so
that's kind of that's how it goes on see
and it blends into my hair really really
pretty so then what I do is I brush it a
little bit I brush it a little bit like
that and it just blends in really nicely
and then when I curl my hair it blends
in even better my hair is not curled
today but that's the length of it
hopefully it's not going on the mic when
I'm gonna wear it for the rest of the
video because I really do like the way
that it looks my husband loves it I love
it
and it just makes me feel more calm
and happy and I don't have to wear it
all the time I love that my natural hair
is on top so that it's not so weird my
hair is am on second day hair I don't
wash my hair this morning so when my
hairs Larry Larry come back so when my
hair is freshly washed I think it looks
better too it's really really liked it a
lot I love it
so um so yeah I'm gonna wear that first
the video so yeah let me go ahead and
show you the rest of the things I got
were already 7 minutes in does it move
her slip off I was in windy New York
City and it did not come off I felt like
I had to hold it on the back of my head
but I probably didn't but it was windy
that day it did not come off Laura must
know if it's heavy at all I can feel it
all the time I can feel it but I don't
feel like it it's heavy you know it's
not annoying everyone small it feels a
tiny bit itchy I guess because of the
lace but it's not annoying
I just kind of had to get used to it and
now that I've worn it I don't know four
or five times I feel like you know it
feels fine now it feels a lot more
comfortable hi Michelle how are you
Michelle has been having some health
things going on I hope that you're doing
well my friend Shan wants to know if
it's wear length or thickness both
because the hair like for example this
is my hair up here this down here is not
so if I had to pull my hair my hair is
here and down here it's not so you can
see how much thicker my hair looks than
it did at the beginning of the video and
then the length here so the length on
this one is I could do a whole video on
just this 16 to 18 inches is what I got
and I don't know the color does it say
the color on here it says number 99 so I
don't know if that's the shade or what
but um oh and it also came with a 5 year
warranty which I don't know what the
exclusions are on that I haven't read it
yet but um but it makes me really happy
so I you know I feel it you always have
to do kind of what makes you happy and
what you need to feel you do what you
want to feel confident you know chime
says not for people balding on the top
of the front that's that's probably true
that's probably true because you do need
something here Pam says does it feel
like it could slip out easily no not at
all one thing though is it does kind of
bubble out in the back every
once in well where I feel like I have to
kind of flatten it down especially after
I've worn it for a while but I do really
like it
Lauren says how do they say how long it
will last I don't know they do have a
five-year warranty on it so I would
imagine it's supposed to last at least
five years can you put it in a ponytail
yes easily I could easily put it in a
ponytail and nobody I don't think
anybody would know that it's not my hair
you can put it up yeah because my hair
is on the bottom too so like right there
I mean you might I might have some
trouble just because I might have
trouble brushing it up into a ponytail
but a low ponytail would probably be
fine
Shane must know why a halo is supposed
to tape ends or clip ends because I can
I'll just take it out I'll show you look
no it's out done tapings clippings do
not come out that fast and your girl
does not have time for all that all
right I'm just gonna leave it out
because they did take it out because I
wanted to show you how it works all
right I do want to show you the rest of
the stuff and people watch it on the
replay thank you for your patience
through all of that and one wants to
know if you can dye it yes how often you
wash it I don't know when it starts to
look cruddy I'm gonna start washing it I
need to do more research on when to to
wash it so I don't know all right
I'm gonna stop even stop but I can
always answer questions in the comments
of the video if you have additional
questions so let me show you the other
stuff that I got this is one thing that
doesn't fit in the bag that I got this
is from Sigma
it's one of their brush cleaning towers
and let me give you a little mini review
on this I don't really like this I kind
of like it I don't really like it and
let me tell you why when you put the
brushes in these guys down here are
supposed to shape the brushes they're
supposed to shape the brushes I didn't
feel like my brushes went easily into
these things because some of my handles
are quite thick so I trouble getting the
brushes in here because I can't even get
my because you know if you think about
big brushes you're gonna need a lot of
you know they're thick so my I mean you
can't get the big thick handles in here
and also when you when you put them in
you have to hold it up because imagine
this is on the counter and I'm trying to
stick a brush down here you have to lift
the whole thing up push it up through it
just it doesn't even make any sense
so what I did was I abandoned these guys
down here and I just kind of popped them
all into here as I was popping the other
brushes
some would fall out on the other side I
mean it was just I mean it's functional
yes I but I would definitely if I felt
like I could return this I would return
it but I'm not gonna go through the the
returning it thing that was definitely
an impulse buy it's functional it works
but I don't like it I think that I think
it would be better redesigned I don't
like the design of it
Shana says haha if you're ever in a
hurry to dry it you can hang up from a
floor fan sounds crazy but it works
without using heat that is so smart
showing up the extensions oh my gosh
that's so cool okay
so yeah this is not not my favorite
thing and I bought that doesn't know oh
don't drop don't fall okay next I got a
gift from Mota because I love the people
over at Mota and they love me because I
love them
brands that I don't love don't tend to
love me in case you did that out
but I do love motor brushes so they were
kind enough to give me some of their new
motor mythical brushes I'm not as big of
a fan of the design of these as I am the
other ones the ones that have the the
faded metallic handles I really like
those I think they're really pretty but
the brush designs I mean I think they're
all the same design they're just
different handles they're all the same
thing it's I think they're kind of
pretty they have these kind of crystal
looking iridescent handles they're fine
but they're definitely not my favorite
design so they have two of them there's
a six piece enchanting eye kit and the
perfect a five piece perfecting pixie
kit I'll put those up I'll hold them a
little slower because I'm going a little
too fast there's the pixie one and
there's that one and this is the
enchanting eye kit and usually you can
find these on Walmart's website if you
can't find them their motor does have
their own website so that was a gift
another thing that was a gift which was
really kind was one of my subscribers
actually owns a brush brand and they do
sell some pigments and she gave me these
the brand is called glam 22 I went by
their booth and they're like oh my gosh
it's John you know and it was really
really cold to be recognized that was so
neat so I have not tried these yet I
did give two of them away to my friends
Georgia and shy Georgia is the channel
Georgia Harris and shy is from makeup
struggles I gave each of them one I let
them pick one whichever one was their
favorite and then I just kept the rest
so they sent these little pigments and I
don't know I haven't tried them yet but
I'm really anxious to and if they are
either amazing or terrible I will let
you know most likely if they're I can't
imagine them being terrible they're just
pigments unless they just that would be
very odd to me if they were terrible so
they've got these cute little sisters up
here which are cool and I personally
like pigments I know a lot of people
find them to be very messy but I like
them there's that and then swatch you a
little bit
I find pigments tend to be more
pigmented they do get a little messy
this one is the shade I woke up like
this you can see the shine on there it's
really pretty so I'm excited to play
with these more I'm going to show you
something that's on my eyes today that I
used specifically because I wanted to
show you and I wanted to play with it it
was the first time I used it
that's right here so I got this one this
is their cupcakes and monsters palette I
am wearing that on the bottom portion of
my eyes today I used the purple over
here the rest of my eyes are the makeup
by Mario not makeup by Mario the k'kaw
Mario palette I wanted to see if they
played well with other shadows and they
did so I've got makeup by Mario this is
makeup by Mario k'kaw in my crease and
my brow bone and then on my lid I have
the purple on the outside and I blended
it pretty well because I didn't want it
to be super super bold when I first put
it on it was like boring your face and
then I put the white on eating when I
see now if you did not see my crayon
case video they have now blocked me on
Instagram I reached out to them they
emailed me on
they sent me quitter message because
apparently they realized that that was
where they could reach me best and they
asked me to email them so what
you know them and I put up the emails on
Twitter if you want to know what I said
to them and basically I answered their
questions there basically I don't want
to go through the whole thing
and then I actually offered this morning
to help them with their ingredient lists
if they have future products coming out
if they wanted me to look over the
ingredient list at no charge to them I'd
be happy to do that you know of course
I'm not gonna be liable for any mistakes
but you know if they want him to do that
I would do that and then the next thing
I looked at which I don't know if those
before I sent that email after it was
definitely after the first email that I
sent kind of responding to their tweet
their DM on Twitter they blocked me on
Instagram so I take that as they're not
good people
and my thoughts and this is the thing
too is I am NOT going to promote them on
on what's the makeup anymore they they
will not be getting more airtime because
I don't trust them I don't trust them
for you I will put up you know Jeffrey
star stuff even though I don't purchase
because I feel like there's no harm to
you and getting those things Lime Crime
hasn't had any problems in a long time
so we are still putting up line crime
but I'm not gonna put the crayon case
products on the show anymore and it's
because if they're handling this with me
this way if you have a problem ordering
I don't want you to get stuck in the
same situation that I am where they're
blocking you you know all of that I'm
not doing that I'm not doing that and I
don't I don't recommend that you order
from them anymore I did say at the end
of my video talking about it that I
definitely think that it's great that
you you know if you still want to order
from them that's fine but but yeah I I'm
not I'm done with them and I don't trust
them anymore to recommend them to you
and I will be putting annotations in the
video description for the original
crayon case video and my current one
because if they're gonna act like this
then I don't know if it'll be good for
you or not so that's kind of the
conclusion on that oh my goodness for 17
minutes and everyone showed you a couple
of things
sorry about that off topic so yeah so
this will be replacing that and I think
I will be passing on that box of crayons
eyeshadow palette I already knew I was
gonna pass on the primer because it's
not my favorite but I'll pass on the box
of crayons to I'll even one at my house
I'm so irritated I don't want
at this point I tried but mmm all right
let's go on to happier things so the
people to balm are stinking amazing okay
let me talk about the balm real quick
so the balm I was talking to them I
always talk to them about how much you
guys know I have my brand reviews of the
balm I do feel like they need to be more
inclusive I will tell you that and I did
talk to them about that a little bit
while I was there and you know not not
preachy at them but kind of like hey you
know hopefully you know you'll expand
your shade range
just a little bit I just kind of threw
that in there a little bit
just very quickly about expanding their
shade range and I didn't go in too deep
I could have gone into you know
representation and all that but I don't
wanna be preachy but he did mention it
just so you know but they were kind
enough I was going to purchase this they
were kind enough to give it to me this
is the take home the bronze bronzer and
this is the lightest shade so so yeah so
I was going to buy that and then they
gave that to me which was really nice
and then they actually sent me because
they were out they sent me the mary lou
manizer hold on a second the liquid one
where did it go did I did I pull it out
I think I did I pulled out the bronzer
they sent me this one this is the the
Bonnie do manizer I haven't tried this
one and then let's see this one I have
not tried yet let me show you I would
imagine this one would be nice for
deeper skin tones though I think this
one might be a little too dark for me
for for a highlight I don't know
actually that's not that dark at all I
thought was gonna be a lot darker than
that but that's the one and if it was
darker I would not be complaining trust
me there's plenty of highlighters for me
but yeah that's actually more gold I'm
surprised that that isn't deeper because
I think the original is a little bit
deeper torinte fairy nick says the
bronzer was nice though yes and then
where's the where's the other one I know
I brought it down I brought down Mary
Lou I'll find it as soon as this last
ring was done watch me watch me find it
soon as live she's done I put everything
this bag so will be nice and there it is
I put it next to this okay so this is
the mary lou manizer or the liquid one
I'm gonna put this next to the bonnie
bonnie bonnie and i do have the liquid
on this side and then i have the powder
Marylou on the other side when we put my
glasses up so you can see see if you can
see the difference so that's the powder
mary lou and that's the liquid mary lou
I do feel like the liquid mary lou sits
more on the face then the the liquid i
mean then the powder the powder i think
it really blends into the skin a little
bit better
there's the mary lou but mary lou is my
favorite highlighter of all time and
there it is on my skin tone and then
this is the mary lou here this is the
the powder so you can see kind of the
shades mixed or actually let me swatch
this next just so you can see so there's
the mary lou liquid and the mary lou
powder and i should have brought that
one down and i didn't I'm sorry for that
okay so yeah the liquid is definitely
more visible you can definitely see it
more but it doesn't melt into the skin
more so it's really going to be about
personal preference on that one alright
so I don't have too many more things
Cindy wasn't the bomb is so would it
target the bomb is sold at Kohl's I
don't think they're sold at Target
Selene says tart mermaid palette I'm
gonna skip that one i swatched it at
sephora i know that a lot of people
really like it i'm gonna skip it okay so
I got some inglot duraline which I
haven't used yet this is for like
rewedding products creates a liquid
waterproof product improves application
prolongs life of makeup and enhances
colors so I'm really excited to try this
I've heard such good things about it
this is the only thing I got in glot
that looks like this so I will be trying
Matt if you have any tips on using on
how you like to use your line please let
me know where can you buy the tsuba
eyeshadow palette Emily wants to know I
believe only on their website if you
type in super beauty actually I'll do
that for you right now just so you don't
have to do it I like to do the legwork
for you
Suva Beauty calm and it is a I believe a
$50 eyes shadow palette but everything's
on sale at I'm
so I did not pay that it said oh hey
that's from camera-ready cosmetics hold
on a minute
I showed up out so let me just make sure
yeah fifty dollars that's a lot I did
not pay that much I want to say I paid
like thirty five for it something like
that okay so let me show you I got a
bunch of lashes I got this one from g4e
if you saw my Instagram there's a
picture of me with men with glitter
beards they were so cute I could not
walk away without buying something
because they're so adorable so I just
bought a pair of lashes these are the
Lulu lashes lashes and then I bought a
bunch of Koko lashes because I know I'm
gonna run out eventually and I love
these lashes so I bought a ton of those
I got allure which is a repurchase and
then they didn't have a lot of the ones
that I was wanted to repurchase so I
just got all the ones that I thought I
would like this one is called flirty
love these things this one is called
news
this one is one zero two which is a
repurchase I believe no maybe not I
don't think I got this before I think I
started at 105 and then this one is
called nine to five so these are a
little more allowed than the other ones
that I got they didn't have too many
natural ones and then this one's called
Nisha oh it looks like it's over my eyes
that looks so creepy I'm gonna take that
away cuz that's creeping me out another
impulse buy was this right here this is
from a brain called Pacific Instruments
and this is for smashing your lashes
your fake lashes onto your real lashes I
wanted to try this because I can't put
my lashes on with the tool I feel like
I'm gonna put my eyeball out so I
thought this would be good so I bought
that and then I got a couple just couple
more things I got a couple of Sigma
brushes I got an e 20 and then I got an
e 21 because I do really like Sigma
brushes they're just a little pricey so
I like them on sale better and then
finally this I did not purchase my
husband got this from me this is the Kat
Von D locket
primer he was sitting in watching
Stephanie from the Kat Von D collective
she
she was doing a makeup tutorial and
everybody in the audience got one of
these everybody that was watching which
I thought was so cool so he gave this to
me because he was sitting and watching
that while I was off with Georgia and
and Shai so but that was really cool I
have used this a couple times it is I
was very I wasn't sure about it was
weird it's very hydrating but it's got
shea butter in it as like a higher up
and reading which I thought was really
weird for a primer so it's very
hydrating I wouldn't recommend this for
somebody that doesn't want extra
hydration underneath their foundation
because I would imagine this wouldn't
mix well with a lot of foundations so
just be careful with this I'm still
testing it I only tried it under the
NARS foundation and it did not do well
without the NARS foundation it did not
mix so I'm gonna keep trying this and
see how it goes but yeah that's my IMATS
haul so my quick reviews let's just kind
of sum up I still not sure about this
only try it at once love my Koko lashes
I love the bands on them I love that
they last a long time really liked them
hey Sam's here from here for the teeth
hello so g4e lashes haven't tried those
yet swatched the just one of the these
guys right here at the glam 22 pigments
I haven't tried them on my eye so I
can't review those the balm I'm still
not sure about yet I feel like they late
and step on the skin rather than meshing
into the skin haven't used this yet like
this but it's very lightly pigmented be
the Beaumont bronzer it's very lightly
pigmented it's definitely one of those
buildable formulas so if you're in any
way not sure what shade to get I would
say err on the side of darker rather
than lighter on that and inglot duraline
I have not used yet I haven't used the
Sigma brushes yet the hair extension was
a definite yes the Sigma brush holder is
a definite no and the Suva Beauty after
one use of two shades a movie amazing
when these swatches for you real quick
oh and then the motor brushes I haven't
tried yet but I love motor brushes
they're all pretty much the same let me
swatch this baby for you real quick just
so you can see the fabulousness of this
thing oh that's not that pigmented I was
expecting it to punch me in the arm
didn't what but if they're buildable
that's not a bad thing I'm shocked I'm
shocked
yeah that is not how it applied on my
eye hmm and that is not the swatches
that they show online either they're
very light let's go over them one more
time because I have to know I have to
know whether this is just a because they
leave one of my eyes are really nice
yeah they're building see how it's
getting brighter oh it's a little
powdery they're surprised but brush
watches would probably be more accurate
than what I'm doing right now anyway I'm
glad sound like I'm making excuses
because I totally am there you go
they're building a little bit oh no what
happened to the green
I lost the green somehow I missed the
green and then nobody there you go yeah
they look patchy and terrible in my arm
but it worked today good on my on though
I'll tell you that but again I only use
two shadows so now I'm saying I'm not
going to say that this is amazing yet
because the swatch is freaking me out a
little bit but well so we'll see what
happens all right well this has been 28
minutes I didn't expect it to be that
long so I'm gonna go ahead and pop off
here mamas the mama Guney says I can
live a buildable me too
