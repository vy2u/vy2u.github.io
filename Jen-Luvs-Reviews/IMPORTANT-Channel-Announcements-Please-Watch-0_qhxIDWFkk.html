video and I'm so glad that you're here
to get this information because it's
going to be we're all gonna have to work
together on this to inform the people
that are not watching this video of
what's happening because I know not
everybody's gonna watch it and the
people are going to be confused like you
should watch video where I says you need
to watch video but we're all gonna work
together on this we've got this we're
gonna make it it's temporary I'm getting
into the details right now depending on
how many places you follow me on social
media depending on what conversations
you've been a part of what videos you've
watched you know more about the
situation than other people you may know
nothing about this situation so this is
what it comes down to I know you've got
stuff to do I'm going away for two
months I will be gone from the end of
June from June 24th all the way to the
end of August I'm taking a very long
road trip with my family I'm gonna put
the map up here so you can see kind of
the states that I'm going through just
to give you an idea of where I'm going
because of taking this long road trip
with my family I won't be able to put
out the content that I normally put out
such as what's up in makeup such as the
daily makeup minute those are things
that I need consistent internet
connection in order to keep up with
what's up in makeup is a huge project
it's it's it's a lot and there's just no
way I can consistently you know
guarantee that I can put that out so all
of the whatsapp and makeup content is
going on hold until the first week of
September it is all coming back so if
anybody's having a panic attack in the
comments where's what's up and makeup if
I'm not there if you can let them know
it's coming back first week of September
also my in-depth reviews are going to
pause as well until the first week of
September because I can't get any new
products unless I'm going to the store
and then I have to test them and they're
just very labor-intensive to edit and
the point of me going away with my
family is to spend time with them and if
I'm spending an entire day
a video like I normally do then that's
kind of defeating the purpose of the
vacation you know and a mean but there
is still going to be content on the
channel the content on the channel is
going to be mostly commentary type
videos so it's going to be you know top
fives
you know like top 5 drugstore products
if I lost all of my makeup what would I
replace it with I mean you know how many
products that I have and there's a lot
of things I've never talked to you about
that I either really love or really hate
or things that you know I want to give
you updates on things like that so the
plan is to have you at least one video
per week I haven't figured out what day
that video is gonna go live on I'm going
to try to get as many locked and loaded
before I leave as possible that means
that just as you've seen in the past few
weeks the upload schedule is gonna be
weird I have so many videos I want to
put out before I leave so I'm going to
continue to try to put out 2 reviews a
week but they may not be Tuesdays and
Thursdays like you've seen you may get
them Wednesday and Friday you may get
them Tuesday and Friday you may get them
Thursday and Friday you never know I
mean it's really just whenever I can get
the video done and out to you or there
may just be a Wednesday video for the
next couple weeks I don't know but I'm
gonna try my best to get you to review
videos a week until I leave it's only a
couple more weeks left so that means
we've got I believe two more episodes of
what's up and makeup left before the
summer starts along with that one video
a week I'd also like to do some live
streams I'll also be updating the
community tab on YouTube as often as I
possibly can
sending you photos from the road of
where we are little stories about our
day I'll mostly be on are the YouTube
community tab which you can access
through my channel page on YouTube or on
mobile it should automatically pop up
when I post it it should pop up in your
subscription feed I also have a collab
planned that I'm really really hoping
we'll be able to go through you know the
travel collabs that I did like with
Stephanie Nicole and Emily Noel 83 so
there is going to be content on the
channel while I'm gone it's just going
to be very different so that is the main
news that you need to know but before I
go I do want to give you a tour of our
tiny home that my husband built from a
shell of a cargo van he built a us a
little tiny home a little RV inside this
cargo van that I do want to show you
because it's super cool he worked really
hard on it if you saw my rich luxe video
that I did recreating rich lux's makeup
then you've seen part of it but you've
never seen it finished and if I lose you
from this video now I want to thank you
so much for sticking with me during this
time I really appreciate it I know that
you all understand that you know my kids
are only little for a short period of
time we're very fortunate to be able to
be in a situation where we can both take
off for a couple of months and spend
this time traveling the country and part
of Canada you know with our kids I mean
what a gift to give to our children and
to us my husband and I to be able to
spend this kind of time together you
know me and him and also with the kids I
know that 95% of you watching this are
going to understand that I know there's
gonna be a percent that aren't going to
understand it and that's totally okay
it's totally fine but just know regular
content is resuming in September so
without further ado let's go ahead and
head out to the adventure van all right
ladies and gentlemen meet the adventure
van here is the front tab the chairs
there the driver's seat and the
passenger seat both swivel around and
then what happens here is that we have a
table leg that goes right there and then
it becomes like our little dining room
slash it's raining outside and we want
to play cards situation there now this
platform my husband built for the dog
because we are taking the dog and he
gets harnessed in there we were told
that that is much safer by our vet than
keeping him in any kind of crate so he's
going to be harnessed in to the seatbelt
there with the with the platform there
so he is nice and comfortable laying
down the kids are gonna it's hard to
imagine I'll put a picture up but this
is where the kids are gonna sleep up
here what happens is is that a bunk bed
system hooks into these little latches
on these rods and it's like a tension
thing so the bunk beds are almost like
little hammocks and they're really cool
so it's when the when the driver's seat
and the passenger seat are flipped
around that's when the bunk beds can
kind of fit in there and they're just
easy to roll up and they're pretty
awesome this is the back this is our
little kitchen area bringing in here Oh
home lighting oh it's really really
close I don't have good like zoomed out
lenses I'll try to get back as far as I
can so this is the kitchen and of course
they've got cabinets here and then there
is our sink situation it's got a pump on
it so that it we have running water and
then this is our bedroom area this is
where my husband and I are going to
sleep so underneath here this is our
refrigerator it slides out and it's all
electricity powered and then there is
hard toilets and I'm not gonna go into
details of the toilet but it's pretty
awesome
it's latched in there so it doesn't come
out as we're driving but it's pretty
fancy-schmancy to try to keep the odors
down it's like a dump system so there's
no like drainage that goes outside of
the van it's like a like a bag system so
we're gonna really be using that pretty
much for emergencies only
and over here we've got a little coat
hanger and my husband's thought of
everything he's amazing so he also
installed a fan here and of course the
track lighting there that's on a dimmer
so you can dim down by side and then
air-conditioning unit and then down
there is the heating unit so we'll have
air conditioning and heat and everything
just like a regular mobile home so John
sewed these so that whatever temperature
is on the inside of the van stays that
way so they're insulated and then it's
just sewed on both sides and then down
here is all of our clothing and food
storage stuff like that and then our
water tank is back here we do have a
little shower a situation where if we
want to take a shower in our bathing
suits under emergencies and began but
for the most part we're going to be
taking showers at campgrounds and things
like that but yeah so there's the back
of the bed that's how
books from the back end and he also
hooked it up so we can do Shore power so
he has up there in case we want to do
Shore power we can do that and that's
the man that's the man that did it all
so how long did it take you
we bought the van in December and I
finished it I guess like mid April but
that was me working a full-time schedule
doing family stuff and then working on
anything left to do want it overdone so
I just got a custom screen door for it
so on the side here there's gonna be a
whole screen door and then there'll be
magnets the whole way down the side here
so you just push it aside to get in and
that will let let's have a lot of
airflow in there without all the bugs
getting in very cool well you did a
great job what place are you most
excited about visiting I'm excited to go
to Canada and check out the national
parks there I'm excited to go to
Colorado because that was a long story
short I'm just super excited to go there
because we had to skip it last time yes
we went two years ago so we're spending
the 4th of July in the Colorado area
which would be really cool and then
Canada there's a lot of really cool
stuff it's hard to say exactly one place
but nice should be cool awesome so that
is the adventure van I hope you enjoyed
the tour again nothing is changing
except for maybe some tweaks in how many
videos I can get out to you in a week
until June 24th June 24th is the day
that we're leaving I know some of you
that love me dearly are gonna be like oh
my gosh gonna be gone so long who's
watching your house we actually have a
house sitter that's going to be coming
and gonna be feeding the cats bringing
in the mail things like that which is
gonna be awesome we've also beefed up
the security on the house which makes me
feel so much better so I'm not concerned
about the house at all we also have
officer neighbor who is going to be
keeping an eye on the house other
neighbors that are amazing and they're
gonna be keeping an eye out for us as
well I didn't know the house sitter so
they know what she looks like so they
know who should be going in the house
and they see anybody else they know
something's up after the debacle two
years ago with our car getting broken
into I think we like over-prepared all
the safety measures for those if you
don't know that story I'll link that
vlog down below it was terrible but
anyway thank you so much for watching
this video I hope that it clarified some
things for you and again I need you to
be the collective brain and help people
that did not watch this video to know
why there's no ones have been make up
why there isn't as much content on the
channel why things are changing and that
things aren't going to be different
forever it's just until the first week
of September first piece of meat of
September I will be back so thank you
again for being here mad love to you and
I will see you in a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
