the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether it's worth
your time and money today we are going
to be testing out in erick alia this is
a modeling clay mask it was actually a
tie between these two as far as which
one i was going to test this week it was
voted on last week but i chose the green
tea over the cool i just i don't know i
this one was calling to me and i did a
little bit of green tea research that
i'm going to share with you in just a
minute
before we talked about the green tea
let's talk a little bit about how much
these costs and what they are so i got
these off of Amazon it was $14.99 and
you get eight one-time use masks so say
you get this pack of all of these and
actually last week I realized I didn't
even show you all of them this is all of
them for $14.99 so that ends up being a
dollar eighty seven per Mac so you get
the tool you get the charcoals the
vitamin collagen green tea oily skin a
low and Arbutin are butan are butan now
big downfall of these is that you they
don't have ingredients anywhere I looked
all over the internet and I cannot find
an ingredient list for any of these
masks which is a total bummer for me as
an ingredient junkie so so there's no
there's no ingredients for this but what
we can do is we can just talk a little
bit about green tea the reason why
people like green tea in their skincare
is is supposed to be anti-aging and
antioxidant post choice also says that
it has skin soothing properties and it
could also improve the appearance of sun
damage in the skin so of course I had to
dig a little bit deeper there is an
article on LIVESTRONG and also on WebMD
about its cancer fighting agents in
skincare there's also a bunch of
research about drinking green tea so I
will link some links down below for more
information but we don't know how much
green tea is actually in here because we
don't have
ingredient list we have no idea it's
hard to tell for any product how much of
anything is in there but depending on
where it is on the list of its super
high up we have a chance that it may be
a lot of green tea but because we're on
the list
we don't know where green tea falls on
this so we're just going to do just a
subjective looking at my skin putting it
on and then a subjective looking at my
skin after to see if we see any
differences after one-time use so the
directions kind of are little bit
confusing so it says using a measuring
cup put powder and a cup of water into a
bowl with a ratio of one to 0.8 so eight
ten to one whole and then mix evenly and
quickly apply a rubber pack to the chin
cheeks nose forehead except eyes and
nostrils approximately 15 to 20 minutes
after application remove rubber rubber
packs from your face so I had to do a
little bit of math and it says a cup of
water but if you do one two zero eight
zero point eight it ends up being about
two tablespoons of water so I don't know
if it's two tablespoons or a cup so
we're going to have to find that out
let's go ahead and let's open up the
green tea pack whew it smells very nice
actually it's got kind of a light sweet
floral kind of scent but like a nice
sweet floral it smells very nice I don't
think it smells like green tea though
but it smells nice almost like something
you would want to cook with I won't cook
with it but it's not look like something
you want to cook with this is 40 grams
of product here but weight wise I don't
know what we're dealing with liquid
measurement and powder measurement I
don't know it's just really confusing I
wish they give a specific amount of
water and we're going to pour 2
tablespoons a little bit more than two
tablespoons of water so this is clearly
not enough water there's no way it's so
extremely powder so I'm going to take
the rest of my cup and pour that in I
wish I brought a plastic or metal thing
to stir this with but I did not do that
because it's very time-sensitive this
product we don't want it to dry in the
bowl okay this seems to be evening out a
bit if you can see we want to go with I
use actually a little less than a full
cup of water I would say just pour in
water until it looks like a clay
consistency which for me was about 3/4
of a cup of water okay and now we packed
whoo it feels very slimy oh my goodness
it smells very pleasant though and it
doesn't seem to be drying too terribly
quickly but there is a lot left over so
what I would recommend is breaking this
up into maybe even fourths so that you
can use it multiple times because this
is way too much for one face I'm gonna
try to slap on some more just because I
have so much of it I want to make sure I
make the most of it
oh it's dripping down my face Oh gross
okay I'm not going to put it on my upper
lip freaks me out well maybe a little
bit okay so there's still a lot left in
here what I'm going to do is I am going
to leave this for 15 to 20 minutes and
I'll be back for some results okay so
it's not completely dry it's been about
25 minutes but I don't like keep it on
too long and I have to take my son to
his friends house so you can see it's
not completely dry here so if I had more
time I would probably leave it on a
little bit longer but since I don't I
have to leave but you can see right here
that is dry it's a little crap because I
tried to eat some lunch and I've kind of
cracked it a little bit but if I let it
dry completely or if I put less on and
you take me seriously well doesn't look
like this so I put less on it would add
dried faster but are you good to see I
have a lot of the masks left so I would
definitely recommend only
using half of the product and then
saving the other half for another time
because this is way too much and the
fact that it didn't dry completely I
feel like that's the sign that I eat
plenty out the mask
I can't even smile right now it's very
very very stiff that's like Eid oh now
it's kind of cool all right I'm gonna go
walk this off before it flakes all over
my carpet I'll be right back okay so I
feel like my skin looks more radiant I
feel like I've got a little bit more of
a glow it definitely feels soft it
doesn't feel dry at all which is kind of
strange because I expected the clay to
pull all the moisture out of my skin but
it really doesn't feel that way it
actually feels quite hydrated which is a
shock to me I was not expecting that at
all just to show you this is what the
clay looks like as it comes off can you
see that it's kind of gross I don't know
how you remove a clay mask I used water
and splash it on my face but then as I
was doing I was like maybe I was
supposed to like pick it off I don't
know if you've ever used a clay mask I'd
love to know how you shake take your
clay mask off it was a fun experience I
don't know how much effect it's going to
have after just one use but I do feel
like my skin feels very nice so that's
got to be a positive thing I wish I knew
more about the ingredients because that
would give me kind of more insight into
it but it was fun and you like to see
how it all works but my skin feels good
it feels nice it doesn't feel irritated
in any way and I feel like it looks
looks cool so as of now this one the
green tea one is a recommend for me too
I think that was a fun experience if you
enjoy clay masks I think that you would
enjoy these are not out overly expensive
and they seem based on the name of the
pack to have some good ingredients so it
might be worth the investment for you
you'll have to kind of look at your
personal preferences to decide whether
it's something you would want to buy or
not so I want to thank you so much for
watching what's okay this week next week
we are going to be playing with a very
types of popular product this is the
Eliza Becca milky piggy carbonate
in trouble clay masks I've heard this
one is really fun that is carbonated in
a bubble on your skin and I'm really
excited to try this so make sure you
