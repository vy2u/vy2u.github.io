your truck welcome to the end of
generation beauty San Francisco ah this
is my friend Nicole over at yay or nay
Nicole if you are not subscribed Nicole
you're going to love her go over to her
channel and subscribe you elaborate well
you're gonna fall in love with her in a
minute because we're going to shoot this
video together she's amazing so what we
decided to do is because I did go to the
Creator event the cocktail party for
generation beauty and we got this giant
swag bag of goodies and Nicole did not
go to that event but she got the things
that attendees get so I know a lot of
who were curious about the difference
between whether your Creator going to
generation beauty and whether you're an
attendee what you get even though she is
a creator she got the attendee stuff as
a creator she also went in a lot more
lines and got a lot of work let's call
it what do you call it when when you go
around so it's always the trick or
treating I we went trick-or-treating
yeah and you did more treating than I
did so we're going to also show you know
what a kohls going to show you all the
things that she got trick-or-treating
going around now I could have done that
as a greater that went to the cocktail
party but I chose not to because I was
doing other things so basically you get
one of these bags each day that you're
there so starting about one or two clock
you go and get this the next day you get
this so there were some pretty cool
stuff in here I was actually very
surprised about the first day this is
the first again so the first thing was
tart gives this beautiful brush it's not
a bamboo handle and it is the
high-performing naturals bronze and glow
contour brush and look at this I
honestly that I think it looks like
lush it's not awesome that is awesome so
that was very nice you know what I just
thought of might be kind of cool
something we got into bringing Iran yes
cuz I just felt that up okay change of
plans alright I am going to now show you
what I got from chart at the cocktail
party I got a TARDIS mascara which I'm
actually kind of more excited about
Nicole's brush that I am about my TARDIS
mascara even this is really good mascara
it's a very good mascara I think she
doesn't yeah I think yeah yeah she got
she got the better deal with that one oh
gx this is the 02 weightless oil lifting
tonic and a ziplock so it will not leave
so I haven't tried this before but cool
and I got the exact same thing so yes
natgeo rejection we got matching so it
was exactly the same from NYX I got a
set of three intensive butter glosses
and various colors I love these better
glasses are actually my favorites for
the high-end nice okay so we got the
love contours all palette and it has let
me just show you the inside side of the
room uh yeah this powder it's all powder
and then it's got I shadows and then
it's got a cheap product so you get on
bronzers and highlights I personally
don't think i'll use any of these for
contour but you know we're going to
we're going to work with it going to try
it so i haven't tried it yet and then we
got these a couple of the knicks
pigments so we got one in pig which is
number seven oh this one says picked you
up number 21 so it's they're not called
Pig it just says take on the bottom
which is kind of odd you think so and I
don't know I got air okay so we got
number 17 and number 21 and it just says
pig 29 pigs in the owner I'm from Lexi
got a like this is the concealer brush
doesn't say it I have this one yes and
we got a lucky brush sets so this is it
says this is the don't know what it at
home the finishing kit here's that pink
fish instead here's okay so this is the
pink finishing set and it has in here I
haven't opened it yet it has five
brushes and they're all face brushes so
um kind of gives with glance at those
I'm not gonna take them all on the track
where and how about it yeah they all
have the brush guards on them I don't
know I don't think this is brush guard
brand they must be Luxy products but
they all have brush program which is
great for when you're drying your
brushes and they can keep them shaped
for after you wash them so yeah really
smart of luck to you to do that this is
from benefit this is where they're real
is the spoon of business get that little
X template up nice and we got the full
size fugly benefit they're real winsome
there you go and from crown we got a
blue steel waterproof eyeliner or
eyebrow pencil hey so I won't have blue
eyebrows it really is it says I brain it
says waterproof eyeliner / eyebrow
pencil it's blue huh so I guess if you
have blue hair yeah they're blue
eyebrows I don't want might be that's a
thing is that then some people are
coloring your eyebrows smash their hair
when they're doing something I you
missing oh um tear babies I've seen her
do it oh yes right right there we go so
you can follow that trend if you want to
succeed blue my breasts okay we got from
crown a mascara so I got the volumizing
mascara in black there we go okay from
DHC I got a deluxe sample of their
cleansing oil I really like the stuff I
use this with
I'm happy to have this nah come on
Bethany so now I'm like I'm sitting here
thinking and I'm feeling like guilty in
my heart right now with on both sides we
got a full size of the fencing wheel I
know but it's like your Creator to like
I wish that they could give all of the
creators the big swag bag it kind of
tells my heart a little bit because
Nicole's channel is so amazing that she
should be getting all these things and
it's like I'm sitting there feeling
really guilty I like I feel gaga Bonnie
I got an a morir metallics lip cream and
it's a very pretty kind of a coppery
gold bulls eyes yes and we got the same
thing oh yeah we got the same one a
morning metallics lip cream I think it's
the same shade 20 and I'm from absolute
New York really nicest guy i love this
back oh yeah they were so nice of that
brand so nice a pure metal veil and two
flew an eye shadow and so it's soon as a
moment but it's got like a doe foot
applicator and this is a really pretty
kind of copper color and it just goes on
and it stays really well I mean from him
you know his head he's doing this that
was not coming off set yeah i'm going to
try it but that's what look like it did
there you go and we are shaving the same
thing will be we got four of them so
there you go this is Nick I'm like
sitting here it is on this awesome stuff
I need to be more positive I don't mind
breaking I'm bragging lay it's all good
and I also didn't mention from next we
also got a couple of these two two of
these plush gel lipsticks without a red
one and a nude one well which I've never
heard of these they may be new I tried
on the nude one today and it was really
nude so it might be a good like mixer
and ombre kind of shade but I have tried
the red one yet it felt very comfortable
very hydrating okay from here we got a
correcting primer and
correcting that one's really good oh I
love that that's the one I brought is my
primer 0 for the show it's really good
or not uh maybe a little bit like it
feels a little bit but it's not overly
so when I saw with the Smashbox but it
gives a little bit of luminosities
realize I think you'll really like it a
lot and I just found another next once
i'm digging in this bag we also caught
the lip of the day liquid lip liner and
it's like a look of cream color oh but
you actually so they look something like
a very thin eyeshadow brushes yeah like
it's like a litter so yeah the liquid
liner thing that's very interesting and
that what was the brand new just didn't
um oh this is pure pure so yeah I got
the triple threat slimline mascara just
what I'm sure they're not magnet what is
it not magnetic it's the Oh we'll put up
for but it Dave a really good mascara
okay nice well i'm fully charged fully
charged sorry okay i'm so awesome they
said at the mood that this one was
really really good okay so hopefully
it's good and then from the lenny ish

yeah all right yeah yeah as long as yes
water sleeping mask deluxe sample yes
I'm used this before but my chance there
we go and then we got the full size of
it supports tear each other's all right
I am right wait but the thing is is all
of this is part of your admission to
going to me vent so as an attendee or
creator it doesn't go to a cocktail
party you get all of this as part of
your ticket so my ticket I got the
pioneer prices like $75 with fees i
think was like 87 or something yeah but
it was that's what cost to go in and I
obviously have already gotten that
machine prominent and we haven't gone
through the trick or treat bag yeah
right exactly exactly Shea Moisture is a
superfruit multivitamin firming body
lotion oh nice that sounds good a
dimpled skin was it for double skin no
it just says Dippold skins I've never
heard of that before that's very
interesting it's a very
for our cellulite maybe maybe yeah I
don't know that's only doubled skin I
know of right on that hun area well that
smells good it smells really good we got
a shea moisture eyeshadow palette which
I didn't know she was your head makeup
so I did squash this and it looks pretty
stinkin amazing so I cannot wait to use
this and try this pretty I think that's
such a good range yeah it's a really
nice range of colors really going from
light too deep so a lot of different
skin tones would be able to rock this
I'm excited about this jouer and we got
a whoops oh this is the size little
darker in here essential lip enhances
our conditioning lip treatment and it's
discipline to life sample size nice nice
Zhiwei was really kind to the people

to Germany they're about to change the
packaging's yeah when you go into the
store and look for Germany you may see
like some white with purple lettering or
some white with dark pink lettering
things like that to just be aware of
that maybe they're me know if they did I
may have
these or I might have given its erica
erica erica vieira from beauty in the
vlog I might have given mine to her
possibly so I'm not sure I don't have
anything here from Germany but I'm not
saying that it and give me something if
they did then I either put it in the
shower to use it or I gave it to Erica
wondering the other I think I might have
given it to Erica ok hope your lease

adorable very Hana corn and gorgeous oh

so I'm super super sign copies rants its
booth and nice people oh really nice
people over at royal and langnickel
awesome people and I actually don't have
my brush set because I gave it to Nicole
and it's in Herkimer because we actually
got I got the same brush set in New York
when I went to generation beauty I will
insert a picture so that you can see it
and it's a it's a very nice brush that
but i already have almost exact same set
so i needed another one so i do have it
too no seriously so as you can I try it
yeah yes from 65 Petra this is a little
eye shadow duo and it's in place that's
kind of a very light frosty looking kind
of lavender color and cuddles looks like
one of my eyes yes cuz can you believe
she had our eye shadow on all day and
they still look like that is from seven
thirty this morning yay for Urban Decay
primer potion seriously amen from hixxy
we got the large lash mascara large yes
and then from a pop I got the Kajal pen
and it's in city block there you go and
we got the permanent out this is a
liquid lipstick and it is a bright
bright bright pink fish color it really
is it's very right yes aren't you
wearing it I was you know I think I
changed it out well I think I just threw
something else on top
like this this this is the shade inside
so it's all pretty Alex very pretty
color I wear pink a lot and from bon
vivant two masks and they are botanical
mass effects and one is so low sodium hi
Lauren 8 plus Lotus and then chamomile
and teaching awesome and bumpy on I
think NGA where the most generous our
bags they gave us this giant thing of
mask so I haven't even opened the show
you just a little eerie show you i will
put the ears on because this is so
stinking cute now you all know if you
can watch my show up for a while that I
do not use sheet map so i always pass
this on but i will use other kinds of
masks so what you do is you put this on
your head like this and you put it so
that your hold your hair back so here so
that you don't get masks in your hair
and then yeah do I look cute cuz I I
took my glasses off my contacts I can't
see anything and then it's very tight
though so and I have a very small head
so I can see this being very tight on
somebody that has like a typical size I
because I'm very small and I oh that's
my kids the baseball hats I put them on
like oh alright so we cut the books
botanical mellow clay mask we also got
me oh this is botanical mellow clay mask
too so I don't know what the difference
is oh you know when you say like one has
the son of hi-hi Lauren 8 and Lotus and
maybe the otherwise the chamomile tea
tree is that just like maybe it's all in
Korean I believe um so it's hard to see
what's what both are they're both marked
the same but
they are the pink and blue it's probably
the same thing yeah and then along with
that there's a there's a gray one it
says the same thing so i'll have to look
on their website and hopefully be able
to find more information about that and
then they gave this that I don't know
what it is it's not maybe get it or wipe
it off with her to apply it I wish they
had a little instruction booklet to go
and it's that exactly what everything
was and then they gave us all of these
like this though so that's this brush to
apply oh that's cool all nice that's
very nice because I was for you to get
over your hands and that's nice oh so
it's like a oh good I is it the is the
silicon-silicon so you go little bit and
it spreads it on your face I just saw
stingrays ya like it like a cake
anything gray oh my neck or blue I know
right nice and then I think these are
all sheep masks so we got it said that
day mask pack oh this is blemish hair
brightening care hydrating care this is
the nice sinem ID and lime the added
noise scene and a sign berry acai acai i
would say that little california i want
to know where you go chamomile and green
and tea tree collagen and olive sodium
hilar run a and lotus and then the medic
casa sigh and mud wars they should be
homework I know I'm senior thing like we
need to be like like Akio this mask over
here alright so that was very very young
girls in there
so that was really nice I should
probably take this off this long and in
the bottom I gotta meet Matt Hughes mini
blum winter cute what shade no no wait
no it's right there committed oh honey
oh yeah notice I just thought that was
just like blah blah blah a minute we're
good we're sorry and we got the little
lebombo I shadow quad and I'll show you
what that looks like it's really pretty
and I love the bow my shadows huge
collector of foam love it the packaging
so cute and then I'm not opening this up
because it's like full of this sparkly
like glittery stuff and it looks like
it's a code for twenty-five percent off
of the new spin on beauty first rotating
make a map of painting brush it is a car
as a blend master right no lens is a
lens smart there's two okay kiss last
night there's too much silver on top
let's try free to any I Camry and my
confetti is a little bit easier to deal
with because I got the exact same thing
Jesus does yours say forty percent off
to 109 okay so be a forty percent off
discount and with a bigger glitter well
so yeah for the bigger bag mix it a
bigger bag right exactly we got its kind
of cute glitter it's got a little nail
polish little princess is now that cute
and then from vital proteins we got a
little mix to put into our water and
this is the collagen peptides unflavored
we tasted it digital dispensers and it
doesn't right things for your hair skin
nails bones joints muscles and tendons
and they're all natural and real good
for you go and then I got the full size
so this is the college and in peptides
yes the big chemist look did you get
anything wrong from rock your hair no
well we this is the only thing I have
left in my bag this is from rock your
Harris they're dry shampoo spray it
clean and I did try to use this yes
because my hair was a hot mess and I
don't think anything could have saved my
hair so I'm gonna have to keep using
this I'm not gonna hold it against this
that it could not fix the mess that was
my hair yes like the packaging with
yellow crystals yeah the little crystals
are really cute yeah definitely so so
now you can kind of see the difference
between the the friday night swag bag
and the attendees you can decide whether
it's something that you would like to go
to actually there's more there's more
because you're going to show yes what's
good shopping yes 0 pitch then also
mention it doesn't get these I don't get
that a sheep if I don't get any of that
as someone once the Contra party I am
NOT allowed to get those i have a
special thing that i can get these
things but i cannot get those yeah the
trick or treating basically you go up
and you little tickets and you would go
say you write the bomb and you would
give it a little ticket then they give
you something and sometimes they're bad
lines and sometimes the lines they're
really fast and sometimes you can't get
it to anyone just depends what time of
day so I'm on a couple of seasons 52
it's because i'm with my knees on the
first day and we picked some stuff up
and showing you both so if see always
have a giveaway and they have these
little bags they also came to like pink
i thought i had last time i got like
pink and I got the dark grey so this
says be you and these are defined but if
stylist and then this one is browse
before wait r as before boza and like
crispy Hannah looks all the difference I
was havin all right then we got from a
pop we got it will set up eyeliners I
won this okay they have all games
sometimes so I was a little spin a wheel
of fortune and I want a pure I polish
those nice that's a good one at last gen
beauty i won like a sixty-dollar curling
wand often real importance i do the
wheels of fortune if you go well that's
also and then the oh gx people need me
bunch of just sample packet and then
pixi by petra gave us this quad and it
is the eyebright kit so it's like four
very cliff light colors you know they
are very light colors that's I shadow
thought that says I right or cysts that
wears is a color corrector it might be
for like meeting off school yet on the
lid oh my god my eyes look refreshed in
an instant that sounds more like a good
poet fracture for under your eyes maybe
yeah it must be it will stay interesting
oh yeah that's got any color corrector
yes and there's a common factor I was
like gosh the pink is a little bit on
for under your eyes so I guess if you
because of your correcting blue live in
use the paint yeah yeah okay very
pleased and then given some masks from
the lovely people upon the dogs oh um
this is really cool tart wait i thought
that i bought a champion they have some
good deals in the seven Tim I want
to try forever and it's always sold out
so here we go this is what really got
from target at a full-size Tartus mess
yeah which is what we had gotten our
swag bag so if you waited in their line
you've got the same thing as what the
creators got at the party and one piece
of advice if you guys go in first then
go to the biggest brand that you want to
go to Nikita the line is long get in it
then because the line is closed only
harder harder because you couldn't even
get in did you a or tart without waiting
for like an hour and a half until the
very end again so yeah and also
sometimes they run out of product it's
rare but sometimes they will run out of
pocket so you want to prioritize where
you're going first yeah these they're
getting a full-size chocolate bark
pallets at the last generation beauty
and I never got one oh it didn't go into
the to base line first
so in that I can never go too much
because this is an eye pencil and this
is from this is uh oh where did we get
this from I I think they have oh nude
sticks yes that's right asics you got
shoes from like eight different ones and
they had them on these guys hands and a
different skin tones so it's really cool
to see how it looks I'm going to choose
which one we love it so nice and then a
mascara computer the fully charged my
babe and and again this is all included
with the pricier together yeah as an
attending so it's really worth it then
from skin fix a natural vanilla mint lip
balm and your choice of this or I
believe I'm around with it was oh and on
the bomb give us a little insane a
little kind of a peachy color and then
oh I thought some lashes heart has
lashes look oh I sugar got zombies wanna
try em boss you have to tell me no yolk
a bunch of paperwork e stuff and then we
got a little tiny set crown gave this
out i think the last two gin booze i was
at the song my little travel set things
so of the collagen oh and then fixing
our petrol gave us this really nice
lipstick that's nice got it dry shampoo
oh great oh god I'm glad you try you
don't tell me how it is we'll see
rifling pair yeah oh gee Wayne was very
generous though to be give each person a
full-size liquid lipstick and then
another one of the bombs so how human I
snails have such nice presentation they
do every time it's very classy looking
yeah and then oh this is really cute d
HC you bought a little I mouse and a
half little eyelashes on it I wish I had
done more of that stuff I really do I'm
cooking hey myself now there's only so
much time mode yeah I want to do let's
try to get through with my knees and
just one yeah oh and then G ghd the
