my goodness I didn't get to do a lot of
box openings in December so I'm all
backed up and I gotta do two at the time
so we did the two bird boxes and I got
too boxy tribes in last month so I got
one boxy trim this month I got two empty
bags this month I got oh my goodness all
these box openings like I seriously like
I'm ready to move on a bit from the box
Irving's I know a lot of goal of the box
opening so I'm gonna keep doing them but
I'm ready to move on a bet you know I'm
saying are you all enjoying what's up
and make up I hope so and you are
enjoying the box openings thank you for
being here this is FC x 2 so first thing
I'm going to pull up is the December bag
and I think that that's no I don't even
know where the card is for the December
one the heart has no information on it
it's not useful so I love the card but
let's talk about the bag first the bag
is cute it's black and it's got the deep
purple plum colored zipper it's got a
little heart here that says if see on a
little plastic heart it's cute it's a
cute bag I'm really thankful to have it
first thing I got in here is the pixie
this is the fairy dust in brightening
bear and my biggest complaint about this
is the applicator I think that it's lame
and weird and it's not comfortable to go
on I'll show you how that goes on there
let's get out a brush and let's show you
what happens to this as soon as you try
to blend it huh it's not there anymore
where did it go oh it went away because
the eyeshadow stinks i will tell you
that i have always hated pixie eye
shadows but pixie as a brand has
improved a lot since the first time i
tried a fixie product and i was really
ruining this product i really wanted to
work and it's terrible it doesn't work
it blends away it's just even with a
primer it doesn't stick I mean less you
got super glue on your eyes this is not
going to stay on it's it's terrible it's
not the product alright next moving on
from that one mmm we have a good one
that I got this actually I was shocked
how much I like that this is my crown
brush and I have one of those brush sets
from crown brush and it's pretty
terrible
there's very few brushes in it that I
actually use and like don't even have
any in here n even think they don't need
didn't even make it to this like thing
of brushes like they didn't even make it
there because they're terrible precious
I don't even know what I did with them
they don't work I might have thrown away
because I wouldn't even give the name
bags are so bad but anyway onto this
brush I love this brush it's called the
crease shadow brush and it's see 476 let
me show you what that looks like up
close and that is the pack on color part
I love this because it's tapered down to
here so you can get a lot of color on
there it's very soft and it just packs a
shadow on very nicely then on the other
side you have this really cool crease
brush here that's very nice for getting
deep into the crew just got this brush
in my beautylish lucky box this is the
Wayne Goss brush and it is in number 20
and you can see that there isn't a ton
of difference between them the Wayne
Goss one is pointy er the tapir goes
down further but it's the same kind of
general idea I would say the Wayne Goss
brush is much better for really getting
and very deep into the crease getting
that fine line in there it is softer and
it does pick up more product than this
one but I mean really and truly there
isn't a ton I don't know they are they
are different they are quite different
in their shape but they serve a similar
purpose let's just say that I can't I
tried really hard to compare them I
can't compare them there's there's a big
difference between these brushes I can't
I tried I tried to say it was the same
as a wink oz but I can't because it's
not okay it's just not I tried crown
brush is a lot cheaper than Wayne Goss
think that's a 30-dollar brush I tried
it doesn't work but this really is a
nice brush though I promise it is it
just doesn't get the detailing in there
like the Wayne Goss one does and it's
not as soft but it is still a really
nice brush and it's very nice for
getting color into the crease and I do
really enjoy it but I don't know what I
was thinking so very very thankful to
have this I think just having this brush
alone i think is the value of the bag
for me right here i think this is
definitely worth ten dollars next up
another thing that adds to the wonderful
value of this bag this is the tart
lights camera lashes mascara and i have
used this before i'm going to save this
because i don't want to open it
right now but this is a fantastic
mascara very good at separating the
lashes lengthening volumizing everything
I love in a mascara this does doesn't
flake it's just a really nice mascara I
wish it lengthen just a little bit more
but overall love love love this mascara
so that pushes it well over the ten
dollars next thing is a NYX butter lip
balm in lady fingers I think I have the
butter gloss in lady fingers I don't
think I have the butter lip balm but I
really do like the NYX lip balms the
ingredients and mineral oil is the
number one ingredient in it I think yep
mineral oil we'll just kind of swatch it
just you can see that it does have very
very slight pigmentation there which is
very nice because when I'm at work I
don't like to reapply lipstick because I
feel like it's going to get all over the
place it smells really good too it's has
it smells like a Bonnie bail or bond
bond Bell however you say that lip
product I don't know it's not my
favorite formula of lip product but it's
a nice thing to throw in my pocket to
add a little bit of lip color through
the day so very very thankful to have
that as well this is one that I'm not
excited about this is the cool way low
heat revolution boost and this let's see
seriously my husband's in there farting
through my video like it was so loud you
heard that right did you hear that no
everybody farts not that big of a deal
but still like it's in the middle of my
video come on man no you did it knowing
I was filming you didn't have to do it
every push it out that loud you didn't
have to do that you knew better I have
to live with them live to edit it out
all right okay so i have used this
product before um i used it a couple of
years ago i'm probably going to give it
a second chance but basically what you
do is you wash your hair and then you
put this in and then you leave it in
your hair and it's supposed to make your
hair straighten out so that you don't
have to straighten it when you get out
of the shower to minimize
damage from heat styling I don't
remember this really doing anything but
I don't I remember being distracted as i
was trying this product so i want to try
it again I don't have high hopes but I'm
gonna try it again and we'll see how it
goes so that was my December epsy bag so
overall I mean we're definitely above
the ten dollar range I I think this is
definitely worth ten dollars on its own
i would pay six dollars for this i would
pay four dollars for this i would pay
three dollars to try this again and i
wouldn't pay anything for this because
it's terrible so but definitely well
over the ten dollar price tag for this
and i think this is the best FC bag i've
gotten in a while mostly because i love
this brush let's go ahead and move on to
January's bag now I haven't had this one
quite as long so I haven't had quite as
much of a chance to try things but I
have tried a few things the biggest
disappointment in here i think is
getting to lip products well not the
biggest disappointment there's actually
a bigger disappointment in this but I
feel like to moisturizing lip products
in the same bag as kind of lame
especially since they gave a
moisturizing lip product last month
which was the the next one even though
it's got a tint to it but they gave us
the Jew air well it gave me there's you
air essential lip enhancing conditioning
lip treatment and then they gave me the
street Street naturals orange mint lip
balm now I like to wear as a brand I
didn't see anything fabulous with this I
actually had really dry lips before I
went to bed and I was like okay let's
put this to the test I put the Jew air
on and I woke up my lips were pretty
much exactly the same so I was really
disappointed in the performance of this
it doesn't say the ingredients on here
but I I just I was not impressed with
this at all and there's no scent to it
so that doesn't really give me any
benefit to using it if there's like no
happy yummy sent yeah I mean it doesn't
smell it smells like oily doesn't smell
good it's a small badge doesn't smell
good so this this I was pretty bummed
out about this here is the orange mint
one though does have a really really
nice set and the fact that its natural
makes me super happy I got done without
this one but really really happy about
this one it's very moisturizing it's got
a great smell the orange and the mint
actually go really well together
surprisingly
even though I would never put them
together in food they smell really nice
together it's that got fresh clean
awesomeness and there's no color or
anything to it it's just it's a really
nice lip balm okay the biggest
disappointment and this for me was the
pacifica i shadow because mine was
shattered when I got it I had to put it
in the bag that actually there's a nail
polish in here came in this bubble wrap
but I had to put it in there so it
didn't make a huge mess the blue side of
this still has remnants of when I open
this and it seems like it was a really
nice eyeshadow i haven't told if see yet
that I it's broken but I'm going to so
that hopefully they send me a
replacement product but it's just
completely gonna try not to make too big
of a mess I can't give it out I can't
even get it out of the box like I
literally I'm like pushing to try to get
it out and I can't get it out it's like
stuck in there okay I'm just gonna have
to rip the box that's just what it comes
down to okay it was like glued in there
looks like okay the little tape on the
bottom there's like a little tape thing
on the bottom I don't know it was like
stuck in the box but it's completely
shattered yeah i mean like i don't know
if you can see that but it's yeah but i
did want to swatch what it is for you so
you can kind of see what it is before I
throw it away cuz imma threw it away
soon as like film finished filming but
it's really really pretty the last
pacifica i shudder that I got was
terrible it was probably one of the
worst eyeshadows I've ever gotten a
subscription box that was a think of one
of the baked once maybe I don't know but
this one is actually really nice and and
Pacifica is a natural makeup brand so
I'm always happy to have natural stuff
and this is just as coconut natural
mineral coconut eyeshadow so hopefully
if she will be able to give me another
one of those because I really really
like it a lot the next product that we
got is actually one that's really
exciting to me and it's the lash food
and this is a serum that you put on your
eyelashes and I've heard wonderful
things about lash food now I have been a
rapid lash addict for like the past year
or so I keep buying this over and over
and over again because this is the only
reason why I even have lashes at all
Hall really is because of this my lashes
were so short and stubby before I start
using
this and it's amazing another one that I
use for my eyebrows is the my shoulder
masuda goals which is a natural one but
these are starting to run out of the
straight and get low so i'm so excited
to try lash food and see if it's just as
amazing as my rapid lash and my shell so
super super super super uber happy about
that and then the last thing in here is
a nail polish and it's by probe el nail
lacquer and we'll see how opaque this is
okay this doesn't look super opaque as
it's running down the inside of the
bottle I would say this is probably two
or three coats looking at it dripping
down let's go ahead and swap oh yeah
it's very thin it's a very pretty color
though this one right here this is one
coat you can see it's definitely not
opaque let's go ahead and do two coats
you can do it yeah that's two coats
there right there I think it's gonna
need a third all right there we go now
we got opaque okay so there isn't a very
strong smell from this nail polish which
is really nice it's just the typical
nail polish smell definitely opaque in
three coats it's a very pretty
periwinkle kind of blue let me see if
I've any dupes I believe it or not all
the nail pushes I have I don't have any
dupes for this color so I am very very
excited to have it as for this bag as a
whole I think I'm also very happy about
it i mean really just one product that
i'm not excited about at all except for
the pacifica I what I would have been
excited about if it hadn't been
shuttered I don't know why they would
put the nail polish in a bubble wrapping
off with the shadow in a bubble wrap
they always bubble wrap their shadows I
don't know why they did that maybe
they're just trying to say some money or
something I don't know but that was not
a good call at all so excited about the
pacifica if I can get another one we'll
pretend it's not shattered and i'll say
i would pay we'll say seven dollars for
this just because it's a really pretty
color and it seems to be very nice yeah
doesn't blend away like the UM with the
pixie one did at all so we'll say well
you know what I'll the infinite how much
are the Loreal infallible like seven
doll or something like that I would pay
the same price isn't available for this
so we'll say seven does you where I
would not pay anything for because it
did not work well for me this orange
mint lip balm because it is Nash
organic i would pay four dollars for
this and the lash food i would pay ten
dollars to try this this is very very
expensive product it doesn't have a
whole lot in though it's only half of a
milliliter so this is not something that
is going to last a super long time but
it's going to be long enough for me to
give me a chance to try it so i would
say ten dollars on that alone so let's
seize everything 120 and the nail polish
i would pay i dont know IM its i would
pay six dollars for the nail polish yeah
i mean like a middle the road like
drugstore kind of nail polish i don't
think that it's more fabulous than you
know i wouldn't say it's up like to like
Zoya or like one of those fancy or nail
polishes i would say sex bucks on that
so jess personal value is definitely to
bump this one up over the ten dollar
price tag again so two wins for FC in
december and january for me if you got
MC bags in december january i would love
to know what you think of what you god
I'd love for you to know what you
thought of what i got and if you're not
