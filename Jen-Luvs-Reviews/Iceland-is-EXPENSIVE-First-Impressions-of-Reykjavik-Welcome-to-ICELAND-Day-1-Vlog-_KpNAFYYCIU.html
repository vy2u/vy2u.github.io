of here and kitchen and the guy this is
his place you left us bananas apples and
Cheerios and then there's milk in the
refrigerator limits in there and then
you can look out here that's what the
building for blood when we pull it up my

view out the other side of more concrete
buildings but that's okay thankfully and
there's a trampoline it doesn't belong
to us but the kids want to jump on but
some can't do that because it belonged
up it's not just jump on a random person
traveling traveling technology tumble
