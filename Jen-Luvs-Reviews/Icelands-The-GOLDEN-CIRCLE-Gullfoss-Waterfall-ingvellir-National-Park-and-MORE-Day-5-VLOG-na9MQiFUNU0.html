trip hi kids what are we doing today the
golden circles
so this is kind of the place where you
only don't have a lot of time to explore
Iceland do the Golden Circle it's about
three and a half hours around and
there's four major stops there's thing
Valier which is a set of waterfalls and
then haka to lure which is a geyser and
then Gullfoss which is a waterfall and
then kharid which is a rainbow crater so
we'll see what happens with that so
we're on our way to think Wilier
National Park right now are you excited
or what my face that doesn't make for a
very good flaws are you excited
now I don't know not at all he's not
excited you guys excited you guys are
silly alright well we're going anyway
whether they're excited or not we're
going
you ready to walk on Earth's plates are
sitting on magma it's constantly moving
really is a beautiful day here it is
totally different weather is very very
warm out thermal thermal features and
see all the smoking it reminds me a lot
of the a lot of Yellowstone from last
summer
looks very prehistoric what you might
see with dinosaurs on the steam coming
out of that we've built something to
release the steam out of that one
milah where are we we are what's your
fault you know what it's called it's
called go falsified
so this is the last stop on the Golden
Circle that we came to this is called
Karen it is a crater that has a bunch of
water in it so they call it a lake this
is probably the least interesting thing
that we've seen but it's so interesting
I mean you know that's cool we would
have been probably been cooler if we had
been here when the Sun was directly
shining on unfortunately it's getting a
little bit late so we missed the direct
sunlight on it supposedly it's supposed
to be like rainbow but it just looks
like a big lake and we just read a
little bit about Karen and how it formed
and it's actually quite interesting how
it forum that it was a volcano and it
kind of collapsed into itself because of
this magma chamber that was below it and
over time it the groundwater made it
fill with water so that's kind of cool
we left that epic waterfall though so it
was kind of like but now that we know
the history of it and what it is it's
cooler yeah it's pretty neat we've never
done that before so now we can say we've
walked around a volcano so now we are
going to go ahead back to the apartment
I'm gonna cook some dinner we're gonna
have some chicken and broccoli for
dinner yums
yeah and that'll be the end of our day
for today they only decided to explore a
little cave back here over by a
waterfall John likes to explore caves
this is called Oscar cross
and these people are crazy going over
into the water
I've heard that everything's expensive
in Iceland so we've got some fresh
Icelandic mountain air how much you
think this cost can of air air it is 12
bucks 12 bucks American it's 1190 Crona
which is about 12 dollars
okay there hey people must be buying it
this is a river called tumble fool jolt
I'm sure I'm butchering that but isn't
it beautiful
supposedly the fishing is very good in
US River that's my favorite part
this waterfall is called Gullfoss you
can see there's a rainbow
ray'll around this yeah so that is the
last stop on the Golden Circle Tour this
is carrot it's a rainbow crater good
night Iceland I love you but your
evenings are really weird it's midnight
and this is what it looks like outside
it's really weird
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
