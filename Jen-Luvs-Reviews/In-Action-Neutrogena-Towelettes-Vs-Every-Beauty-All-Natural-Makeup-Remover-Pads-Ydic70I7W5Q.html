another one product review this M is on
the shin Se every beauty makeup remover
pads look at this really crazy packaging
it's like reminds me of things like that
girls use for hygiene it's not
appropriate let me tell you I would send
these by beauty box 5 which is a
subscription box service for makeup and
beauty products i will put the
information from beauty box 5 down below
and i was sent these for review but i
promise you i will give you my one
hundred percent honest opinion of how
these things work i'm going to try them
for the first time and then give you my
honest opinion at the end of this video
and down in the description i will give
you a promo code for getting a discount
if you would like to buy these yourself
what I have here is my neutrogena makeup
remover cleansing towelettes these are
my Holy Grail makeup remover and I'm
going to compare them to these so this
is kind of tough I know a lot of y'all
use these things so we're gonna see how
they compare one thing they say about
these is that they're very gentle on
your skin they have natural ingredients
as opposed to these which is like
Chemical after chemical after chemical
water settle ex Olivia as you topple mmm
20 over the chart says it's good night
but you know what I'm saying I don't
know what I'm saying you don't know what
I'm saying I don't know what I'm saying
but it's a bunch of chemical so this is
supposed to be much better for you it's
a hundred percent natural and
moisturizes with a low and contains
vitamin E you don't need to rinse so and
it's alcohol-free see how they're
connected here so you just take rip one
off and then that says you're just
supposed to put a little bit of water so
I just brought a cup of water out here
and we're going to put just a few drops
of water oh one thing i forgot i'm going
to drop my water i'm wearing my
Paint Pot in painterly by Mac I'm
wearing the kat von d ladybird palette
i'm wearing a cielo stay all day
waterproof eyeliner which should be
interesting and i'm also wearing my
lancome defenseless mascara so that's
what i have on my eye i am going to
knock this on a ball and we're gonna see
what one
Pass does okay so I'm just going to kind
of hold this there for a second okay and
then I'm going to wipe one time
hey
now I'm going to take a neutral genome
and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm
going to hold this here hey there's that
and then I'm going to what rub one ton
hi and we'll look at the difference so
let's see how that's look in okay let's
do that one more time hold it here and
I'm going to rub one time let me go and
I'm gonna motor here
and I'm going to rub one time okay see
how that looks
I always shoot again I'm just gonna rub
you know new I'm just gonna go rub rub
rub looking pretty clear their rum um
grab see through the cameras on the side
well it looks like it looked like the
Neutrogena took it off just a little bit
better the thing I need to do one more
pass with this one in order to get the
rest of that eyeliner off okay I need to
get a regular mirror okay now looking at
it in the mirror I definitely see a
black mess going on around this I this I
looks completely clear let's see if I
can use that pads get that black mess
away oh it's disappointing here we go
finally there is kind of a gray around
my eye wear this side there's no gray
this side there's like a gray around my
eye the grey cast so using these I would
have to use some kind of cleanser in
order to make sure the rest of my eye
makeup was off this one I would not have
to do that I wanted to say that these
things were just as good as the
Neutrogena but they're not but they're
natural so you know I mean when you got
a natural product you can't expect it to
be as efficient as a chemical product
I'm sorry beauty bucks five and every
duty it was very very soft on my I felt
very comfortable I don't have any
stinging I don't have any redness it
just didn't fully remove that waterproof
eyeliner that I had I think that was the
problem with it so if you don't use
waterproof eyeliner maybe it will work
better if you're just using like a
normal eye liner I mean that's a pretty
hardcore pen so it's possible if I
hadn't chosen to use that that maybe it
would have worked better but
I do sincerely thank every Beauty for
sending these to me for review I really
appreciate it they're only i think 699
for this giant pack you get 50 of them
the discount for the product is a thirty
percent off discount code I am going to
be putting that link down below and i
will put the name right here for how to
get thirty percent off on the entire
every Beauty website very exciting
discount go over and check them out and
