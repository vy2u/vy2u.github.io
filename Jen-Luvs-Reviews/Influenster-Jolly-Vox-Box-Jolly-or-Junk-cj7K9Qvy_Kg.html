I have not gotten something from
Influenster in forever and they think
it's because I kind of slacked on a
couple of the different things that I've
gotten I haven't really put videos up I
haven't really you know shared them a
whole lot and I think they were low
irritated with me but I'm very thankful
that they have sent me this box this is
the Jolly Vox bar if you don't know what
influenster is it is a try it and share
it a kind of service so it's not really
even a service because you don't pay for
it it's completely free to anybody and
all they ask is they're going to send
you these things they ask you to review
them on their website review them on
other websites sometimes and share about
what you thought of the products on your
social media other than that there are
no strings attached for attached we're
getting one of these boxes the more you
share the more likely you're going to be
invited to other programs so this is
probably maybe my fourth or so
influenced your box that I've gotten and
I'm really excited to get this one I
they didn't tell me anything about it
other than the fact it's a jolly box box
so of course I'm hoping these things
will make me very very jolly and you
will see my first impression now first
thing I see is skinny cow yums skinny
cow divine filled chocolate candy peanut
butter cream and this is my husband's
favorite favorite combination is
chocolate and peanut butter
unfortunately he is on a diet and he
will not eat these on a diet these are
not considered diet food to me or my
husband these are desserts there a
better option may be may be a better
option than other desserts like this
because I am hungry I'm going to go
ahead and show you the way this comes
these are tiny 130 calories I'm not as
worried about the calorie content as I
am about these sugar context i feel like
the sugar is what affects me the most
this is what they look like cutesy
little things and it feels like you get
how many of you get you get three of
them in here three little guys they
smell amazing mm-hmm just as amazing as
I thought it would be but it's more like
a creamy caramel a peanut butter rather
than like a thick peanut butter I'm a
chocolate addict
oh my god that was so good really really
good there's a card in here by the way
that says what everything is ok next
thing I'm seeing is a little duct tape
it's so weird these I think people are
using for crafts and things my daughter
got a little journal for Christmas from
her grandmother I believe you know you
decorate the journal and duct tape so
it's cute it's like a little paint
splatter thing i'll give that to her I
don't know what else I would do with
this but it's cute ok got a little pack
of Kleenex look how cute this will go
into my purse always can use that I got
a Rimmel show off lip lacquer oh my
goodness I have not tried these yet
there's no stiffer want to tell me what
she is Oh Aurora I don't own any of
these I want to own any apocalypse I
don't understand ease are these the same
thing as the apocalypse are these
different i don't know let's just watch
you swatching holy ghazali whoa dude
that's insane alright let's put it on
can I do this can I put this on mmm
feels nice
not a particularly nice sense but not a
bad set I think that looks pretty good
doesn't really match my shirt but
doesn't match my shirt no I like it
though it feels really nice I mean
that's all I can speak to it I like the
color so thankful to have this really
excited about this yay okay in the last
thing it looks like an eyeshadow quad
maybe see it's all bubble-wrapped say
come on tape let's see what this is ah
come on open up open that's me oh it's
by NYC okay everything pretty much our
tribe I am I see I pretty much hated its
shadows powdery uh hadn't really enjoyed
NYC products on the whole I've heard
they're bronzer is really nice oh you
know what I did like I think it was a
lip gloss or something I had by then my
life but every much everything else I've
tried by them i have not liked it's like
a wet and wild thing you know they've
got their really good things that
they're good at and the other things
they just look they're terrible at it
says this is new I don't know if it's
still new hopefully it's still new uh
NYC HD color trio eyeshadow and it is in
long beach sands let's open this up it's
got a little protector thing over there
which is cool got a highlighter all over
lid and crease please because I want to
love these things I swear I want to love
them I just usually don't okay looks
pretty nice these are pretty nice a
little powdery especially this top one
it doesn't look like there's that much
different between the lid color and the
highlight color swatch so just like I
predicted the highlight color looks like
it's pretty lame the other two colors
look pretty pigmented kind of blend them
a little bit yeah they don't blend away
these are pretty nice um for NYC I think
they're pretty nice again I could do
without the highlight color but the
other two look really pretty sure I'll
take it all right so that's all that
came in my jolly voxbox and I could say
in general I've
jolly especially since I just ate some
chocolate and that always makes me extra
jolly I also got some I got the
chocolate I'm very jolly about that I'm
very jolly about me lip gloss thingy
from Rimmel I'm kind of jolly about this
I'm sort of you know useful my daughter
will be probably jolly about this
