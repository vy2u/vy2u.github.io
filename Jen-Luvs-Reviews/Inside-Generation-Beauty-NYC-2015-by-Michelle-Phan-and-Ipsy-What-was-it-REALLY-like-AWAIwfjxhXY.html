generation Beauty vlogs hello people
yeah we're so excited so I was going to
vlog at the party that was the Ipsy
party for creators and my stupid self
forgot to take my memory card out of my
computer so I get there and I turn on my
cam I felt my camera and I'm went there
with Ellie from elko and mini me she and
Nickey Murphy and a bunch of other
people and it says no card are you
kidding me so this is where we shall
start the vlog pneus we are walking to
generation of bute a day one we are
running a little bit late because I had
to film what's up in makeup and it took
me whoa heels heels it took me a hand in
tears nope not this is all going to end
in tears I just know it we're coming so
we're walking what was I saying I will
totally lost record I was saying so
we're running a little bit late because
I had to film so I know that Michelle
Phan has already given her opening
address he's trying I'm wearing heels I
never wear heels so it's like the the
sidewalk is slanted and I feel like I'm
going to fall over I feel like I'm
walking with
hey deal with it but I got cute shoes on
I got cute shoes you wanted to see the
shows let's see the shows and you see
that shows they're cute and they hurt my
feet I wore them all night last night
and my right ankle feels like it's about
our path so yeah so we're gonna go ahead
and catch up with you again when we get
to generation Mutai yes yes true you
hello my friends we are officially at
generation of you che so this is the
deal with generation easy this is this
is what's happened so far so we've had
to drop it on no this is I'm just
dropping the facts here so this is
what's happening there's a lot of people
here and there's lots of boobs and then
what you do is wait line for an extended
amount of time with a little ticket and
then when you give them a ticket they
give you stuff which is kind of cool
because you're getting stuff but at the
same time the lines are long and I feels
on and it's like I don't know if the
payoff of the stuff is worth waiting in
all of his life because I'm not a line
later like I would rather wait like
Christmas timing of how the parking lots
are always like jam packed I would
rather park like way in the back in the
very last space in search for a space
I don't like waiting for stuff so it's
just not my style stand in the line nor
after an hour or ever do they're not
moving so I'm not enjoying that part but
but what I am enjoying is meeting a
bunch of wonderful people is what I am
enjoying I've met a lot of people that
watch what's up and make up which has
been really cool it's cool to see all of
the vendors here and see what they have
and the displays are beautiful and just
like it's interesting just to look
around and all people and all the
different styles and you know different
ways people do their makeup and
everything it's cool and it's decorated
beautifully and it's a really nice event
I've just not a big fan of the ones we
tons of hot chicks here which is cool he
can look all he wants I know who he's
going home with tons of beautiful is out
there and Rhonda need my eyeliner what
is up with my hair speaking about I
didn't like pull it forward it doesn't
look so flat on the top like a poodle
I'll be sticking it out so yeah so won't
log a little bit more if anything
interesting happens probably walk you
around a bit and show you show you where
everything is and that will be kind of
episode
yeah I mean it's cool lines are not cool
nothing that is cool well you guys yeah
we'll check in with you guys in a bit
here four generation beauty day two we
are fashionably late because we felt
like we were here a really long time
yesterday so we just kind of decided to
show up around one so it's going to be
like a one two three kind of situation
probably maybe a 1 to 2 30 we'll see how
it goes i'm looking forward to meeting
some more people i'm not going to be
standing in lines we're not going to do
that today do that today why did I say
to open a cup instead couple lines is
too bad but yeah so we're going to be
like we should walk it around and saying
hi to people talking to some brands
yesterday made some good connections
with Oprah with Mally essence a couple
other brands I'm decided to maybe keep
in touch people hopefully keep touching
their social media people and do some
collaboration kinds of stuff so we'll
see how that goes and we're already
going are you ready to go ahead
yes let's go to just walked in and
there's a huge line looks like for gift
bags for like the swag bags and it looks
like people are just leaving
just very well it's one o'clock I mean I
guess they've been here since 11 so
they've been here two hours that they
got here at the start so maybe they're
just done man I don't know pretty crazy
let's go ahead and keep walking around
