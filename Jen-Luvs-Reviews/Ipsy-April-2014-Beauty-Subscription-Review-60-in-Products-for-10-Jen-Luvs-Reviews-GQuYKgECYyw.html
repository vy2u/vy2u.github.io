on shooting this video yet because I
have a lot of videos lined up that I
wanted to do before I shot my Ipsy video
but I've gotten so many requests to
shoot it that I can't resist doing it
now especially since I've cheated a
little bit and started to watch some box
openings and I kind of know some of the
stuff that Mike in here and I just
really want to know so I can't help it I
have to open my FC I did open the top
here but I do not look inside it yeah if
see if you don't know is ten dollars a
month and for me I feel like this one is
totally totally worth ten dollars a
month I feel like this one is worth at
least 15 a month maybe even more than
that I mean it's consistently thirty
dollars forty dollars fifty dollar value
I'll be as we could go i will be putting
the running totals and i will also have
the skip ahead button which i believe is
right there in case you get bored with
something that I'm doing just click
there if you were on a laptop or a
desktop it doesn't work on the mobile
devices which kind of stinks but if you
can you can click there and skip ahead
if you get bored because your time is
valuable my friends and you don't need
to hear me ramble on and on like I am
right now so this is the bag this month
it is really cute it reminds me of what
was that may be high fidelity do you
guys ever see that movie I love this bag
smells we heard it smelled really weird
yeah would smoke okay I'm gonna put it
down but anyway I was saying John Cusack
high fidelity one of the best movies I
think of all time in my opinion love
that movie but anyway that's what that
reminds me of it says beauty rocks it's
got epsy on it it's really cute I have
so many of these sink and bags I don't
even know what I'm gonna do with all
these bags give them away to people i
don't know all right first thing I see
is urban decay and this one I did see in
another video I feel bad I cheated I
couldn't help it my friends are posting
all their videos and I want to watch
them I can't help it okay so this one I
did get the same I believe
yes as everyone else and this one is in
a black velvet I do have one in zero I
had the one in perversion and I end up
having to take it back because it came
and that shattered face case thing and
it was horrible and so I returned it and
I had to get rid of perversion but I
love perversion and I'm anxious to see
what this is like oh yeah one of my
subscribers and new friends on YouTube I
will put her name down here because I'm
so sorry sweetie it slipped out of my
head but she said that this eyeliner is
the first eyeliner she's been able to
use successfully she I've recommended
like a million eyeliner to her and
nothing is working for this poor girl
but this one worked for her so if you're
having trouble with eyeliner this may be
a good option for you I think black
velvet is definitely a good name for
this it looks just like black velvet in
application I'll show you real quick
some other swatches on here but but yeah
so that's the swatch there let me apply
one so you can see how it applies one
swipe BAM and you know even though this
isn't a full-size I will never go
through this I have a zero I've been
working on for like two years and I'm
never I'm never gonna get there i mean
it's about half the size but still it
takes me forever to go through a pencil
eyeliner so i don't need a full size i'm
happy with this Oh what is in him All
Right Kalin I saw them at I'm at and
they were not generous in any kind of
discount I was like I saw there they had
eyeliners there and I heard you know
from ypsi people watching bag open easy
things you know their eyeliner was
really nice so I said how much is it
twenty dollars in least twenty dollars
i'm at she thinking at least be able to
knock it out of 15 or something but no
but they can give them away in ypsi bags
I don't get it but anyway so this is a
lip gloss it says tinted lip balm so it
must not be very opaque and it comes
with a little brushy-brush mm-hmm ooh I
would not call that a tinted lip balm
that is a lippy sticky holy cannoli wait
till you see this that's a pretty sweet
pigmentation for a tinted lip balm so
very excited and happy to have this
especially since I did see it at IMATS
for twenty dollars and did not purchase
it because it
so ridiculously expensive and I didn't
know if it was going to be any good so
happy to have that big sexy hair root
pump I can always use that stuff like
that to like help me out in that area
you know I've had hits and misses with
big sexy hair let's smell it wow that
was a spray it smells like a hair
product it smells like a hair salon
nothing fantastically smelling or
anything but it says volumizing spray
moose so anxious to try that see how
that works on taming at this gorgeous
main that I've got yes and then I got
the pop goes the shadow by Elizabeth mot
Elizabeth ma take / cards which I don't
use I pass them off to my friend who
loves them this looks actually very nice
seems powdery very powdery let's see how
its watches nice shimmer they're very
pretty got champagne from the way that
it looks in the pan I would have
expected it to be darker more of a
medium brown but it's definitely a light
champagne but it's very pretty i'm
anxious to use that looks like there's
one more thing here i mean in all this
is ten dollars like really and then I
got the dr brandt microdermabrasion skin
exfoliant and this is something anything
that says microdermabrasion freaks me
out because it makes me think of like
the people to get microdermabrasion and
then their face is like red and scarred
for like a while because they peeled a
layer of their flesh off and I just
don't want a layer of my flesh peel it
off I don't know about you but I just
don't that doesn't sound appealing to me
especially since I've normal skin so
this will be passed on to one of you
glorious people if you are interested in
this dr. Brandt micro dermabrasion
sample it is a point 25 ounce if you're
interested in this you're going to put a
comment down below and you're going to
tell me you're interested in it and
within the first 24 hours the upload
with this video you can enter and then
after that I will cut it off pick a
winner and ship this out to you I have
been terrible as shipping things out
quickly so I cannot tell you when I will
send this to you but it will be said to
you I guarantee you that all right and
then
it for there but i did get thanks to you
glorious people i did use my FC points
to get aha two of these these are the
tokyo milk dark lip balms okay and one
is in salted caramel and the other one
is la vie &amp;amp; rose and they had these
available and I jumped on it a special
to salted caramel I was like yes I want
that in my life I have a little bit of a
salted caramel addiction especially when
it's in chocolate or coffee so I'm
excited to try that this one is number
36 the salted caramel coat smells like
straight sugar yes mm-hmm I want to eat
this I know in my heart and my soul to
eating this is a bad idea but I want to
eat it so bad my mouth is watering but
I'm not going to eat it i'm going to
have self control and then this one is
the one that's the Rose one let's see
mmm this is number 42 and I can smell
the rose already I can tell I won't want
to eat this one mmm it smells rosy and
what other florally cents in there as
well I'll keep it I'll use it it'll be
fine but I'm not you know I definitely
like the salted caramel better but I do
like this as well so I'm going to keep
this one too so that is it for my Ipsy
