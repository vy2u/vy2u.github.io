nananananana hello my friends welcome to
my review of my March FC bag and showing
you what I got in my april epps bag just
got my notification of May Ipsy bag and
I was like oops I think I better review
the March one show you what I got in
April and then hopefully the May one
won't take so long but I definitely did
want to put this video up because I know
a lot of people really liked this video
so but without further ado let me go
ahead and jump into the review of the
March bag I do pay for this outright
it's not a promo I pay for it just like
everybody else so anyway let's talk
about what we got let me tell you the
standout product in May the Santa
product for me was this mellow bronze
face blush really like this product a
lot is so nice it's a beautiful shade
I've used it a little bit for contouring
it's a little warm for contouring but
I've used it for a blush like an actual
blush bronzer for blush and I really
like it a lot it's got a really nice
pigmentation really nice lasting power
definitely awesome for this I am excited
to try more product from this brand
hopefully epsy will get more products
from them I'm super stoked about this
book this bronzer / blushy thing yeah
starlooks ok let's talk about the star
looks because this this one's the one
that I'm I'm sad about that I got
because i've got probably nine different
star looks eyeliners from years of
getting subscription boxes and char
looks eyeliners don't work for me and
let me tell you why the big reason why
most of them don't work for me is
because on the lower lash line they do
tend to run if you do like them on the
upper lash line i feel like a pencil
they're absolutely fine there's nothing
wrong with them they're nice and creamy
they go on super pigmented things like
that but i didn't want to waste this
because i have a ton of black eyeliners
open right now and it just would be such
a shame to open it use it once or twice
and then not use it again so i did keep
this in the packaging because i have a
lot of experience with starlooks
eyeliners so i did not do that the other
thing that i did not open was the next
liquid suede in the shade soft-spoken
because i already own this i will tell
you that I'm not the biggest fan of this
formula my biggest complaint of the
formula is that it it doesn't wear down
evenly it wears down really patchy but
if you put a lip balm over top of it as
it's wearing down it does age a little
more gracefully but overall I mean this
is a beautiful shade it's absolutely
gorgeous let me get mine hold on okay
here's mine and I'll swatch it for you
by the way if you're curious about what
I've got on my face I have an actual
really real tutorial coming up next week
on this look it's the Urban Decay alice
through the looking glass palette i'm
going to be reviewing this and i have a
tutorial so if you are interesting that
don't forget to hit the subscribe button
so that you don't miss that next week so
anyway this is the soft-spoken lip
liquid lipstick oh well it's not a bad
formula it's just not a great formula i
don't think i'm gonna be buying any more
from this line i am thankful to have
this one because it is such a pretty
color but it's definitely not my
favorite formula now for the like okay
products this is the bow gosh she's got
she gosh I don't know Paris eyebrow
brush this is to me is not an eyebrow
brush this is an eyeliner brush because
it's so thin I do like that it has
bit of a stiffness to it because then I
can use it for eyeliner i have used it
for eyeliner it's really nice for Joe
eyeliner specifically it's also good for
a liquid liner if you have a liquid
liner that needs a little bit of
smudging out it's very very nice for
that I did not enjoy it for my brows
it's just not thick enough to handle
these caterpillars so but I am enjoying
it as an eyeliner brush and then I got
the organic search daily care comforting
hand and nail cream and lavender meadow
this is a really really really strong
lavender scent when I showed it to you
last month it sell it smelled like it
had a little bit of a sweetness to it
just smelling it in the tube it doesn't
it's just straight lavender what I did
was I put this on my bedside table and
then I rubbed it on my hands before bed
and lavenders like a very calming sent
so I enjoyed it for that purpose was it
extra special extra amazing no but it
was nice it's nice I've used most of it
and I'm enjoying it but I probably won't
go out of my way to purchase any more of
these just wasn't super impressive so
overall I mean was this worth ten
dollars for me no it was not worth ten
dollars for me because this I could have
done without it was nice but I could
done without this I already owned whoa
this one this one I already own so I
didn't really need that and the formula
is not super Fab Four me the brush I
mean it's nice but I didn't really need
it I mean it's kind of like one of those
things where you know it's nice and off
but it wasn't something that was like
yeah this is awesome the only thing I
really really liked was the mellow
bronzer and to me this is not worth the
ten dollars for me this was maybe worth
six or seven dollars for me so I mean
it's not far off and I guess if you do
the try it factor oh and then the star
looks eyeliner of course I didn't want
didn't need so if you go for the try it
factor may be worth barely ten dollars
but definitely not a huge fan of the
March bag let's go ahead and show you
what I got in April there is one product
missing I'm going to put a picture of it
right there I have misplaced it and I
know as soon as this video is over I'm
going to find it because that's kind of
what happens with me as I I lose things
for when I need it and then I don't need
it it's right there does that happen to
you that happens to me all the stinking
time so I'll show you everything else
except for that face mask I haven't
tried it yet and I can't speak to it but
I haven't tried
but this isn't a review of this bag this
is just the me showing you what I got
show you what I'm gonna be reviewing
next month the thing that I'm most
excited about is this Nomad I shadow
it's very gold and very gorgeous and
very creamy I definitely want to use it
more I have used it but before i do a
full review i definitely want to use it
more so far so good on that we also got
this little mini tart lipsurgence in
wonder this is a very bright shade for
me I'm gonna have to use that this
company have to be a weekend shade
because no way I'm going out of the
house with this thing on for work it's
too bright too crazy but I do enjoy
tarte lipsurgence is so i was really
excited to see that in the bag I got
this brush that I have use you can tell
because it's colored this is a crown
brush it's got a little dig here which I
thought was really interesting for like
holding it so that you can put your
thumb there and your finger there which
i think is super creative this isn't the
the duo fiber with the little sparse
bristles is not my favorite kind of
brush but so far so good it's pretty
nice but again i'm going to wait for
their full review until later on till
next month while the end of this month
hopefully and then the last thing in
here i got was the skin bright eyes I
enhancing liner these are really really
nice I've only used it once so of course
I need to use it more but it's a very um
you know very light flesh toned color
you're supposed to use it to brighten up
your waterline so i will be using that
as well and that's what I got my April
bag so one two three four with the gold
eyeshadow and then this gold eyeshadow
was in the shade Marrakech Marrakech
desert sands i believe and then the face
mask that i have shown you so i don't
know we'll have to see i mean i'm really
excited about that eyeshadow but other
than that i'm not super duper uber
excited about anything else but the more
i use it maybe i'll like it more i was
happy not to get another hand cream
though because I'm like up to my ears in
hand cream right now so I want to thank
