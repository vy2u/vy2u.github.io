unpacking I steckley not not bagging
this month because I kind of already
unbanned it I want to do something a
little bit different where I want to
kind of try the products a little bit
before I show them to you especially
since now I am officially back to work
and it may take me a while to shoot some
of these videos this month i got my Ipsy
bag maybe the 15th 18th of the month so
uh yeah it took me a little while to get
the bag and then you know it gets a
chance to film this was my Ipsy bag this
month I did get two extras that i'm
going to show you that i got with epsy
points you know ypsi points I kind of em
like kind of hit or miss with the FC
points because you know there are a
thousand points for one thing the value
of the items usually aren't too
fantastic sometimes they are if you can
catch them and and and this is the
things you have to catch them you have
to like be online and like refreshing in
order to get some of these deals I mean
it's just I really think epsy needs to
improve on their point system like no
joke like I'm very fortunate in that a
lot of you all sign up using my link so
I have some points like saved up so that
whenever I see something I want I can
pretty much get it but you know being
able to even be on there at the right
time to get it before they sell out is
just crazy so they've really need to do
something about that like I've got to
have some extra samples lying around or
something it's just I'm a little
disappointed in their point system right
now but let me show you the two things
that I got this is something I
experimented with for the first time
today and this is by nail teeny I can
tell by the martini on the top I don't
remember exactly what they swear they
said it was from they said something
else it is it called a shadow tint and
it's in ambrosia and let me just show
that to you and again this was not
included in the regular epsy bag this
was something I got with my thousand
point perk so that's kind of how that
went on and it is a like a like a
purpley mavi kind of color it has a
shimmer to it actually does have a
little bit of sparkle I noticed when I
put it on my I let me show you close up
what i did i know i need to get my
eyebrows did but but yeah it's kind of
like over
here in the corner osh and show you that
I cuz I'm a mosquito bite right there
y'all don't care if I mosquito bite I
got mosquito bite there but anyway it's
like right here kind of in the corner
there and hold on I did find it quite
difficult to work with my you know
blending it with my finger was difficult
blending it with a brush was a little
bit easier but still like it was a true
cream product not like a cream to powder
product so it made it a little bit
difficult to work with but I did it I
definitely wouldn't recommend this for
anybody beginning an eyeshadow because
it was kind of a pain in the butt to use
will I use it absolutely but what I
recommend it you go out of your way to
get it probably not again this is my
first time using it so I can't really
speak to the lasting power on it or
creasing and all that but I did want to
mention that i did use a and kind of
give you my first impression so that was
that and then the next thing that I got
was these little stickers that everybody
was kind of mad about I think they're
worth like 5 bucks or something but I
had I did have a lot of points and I do
love nail stickers so i did get these
and these are the rap artist nail decals
and you just get a few little stickers
in there is this worth a thousand points
absolutely not especially if you don't
have subscribers from your blog or your
youtube channel you know getting you
points you know it's one sheet 1 sheet
of stickers i actually just got of
course it's from china so you know
you're going to get a lot more and i
don't know how good the quality rice but
i just got like 50 s thinking sets the
stickers like this for like six bucks or
something I mean I don't know one and
let me show you what I actually got in
my Ipsy bag and I am being a little
quieter not just because I don't want to
yell put because my husband is actually
sleeping next right over there he's
probably not sleeping right now because
he's probably faking it but you know I'm
trying to be a little considerate and
not yell I guess I'm filming right next
to him so that's not really very
considerate but you know he understands
and he loves me so it works out thing we
got was the Coastal Scents forever blush
little sample and you do get twenty-five
percent off at checkout and a coastal
scents honestly like I really do like
Coastal Scents i would say seventy five
to eighty percent of some of that moon
cuddles coastal scents i really like for
an inexpensive one of
those you know the ones that make 88
pallets you know like there's Coastal
Scents there's bhcosmetics there's you
know the ones that you kind of look at
and go and it's going to be any good
honestly I like Coastal Scents better
than bh cosmetics overall I their
quality of the products are better and i
did use this actually one day i'm not
wearing it today because it didn't match
the lipstick I know that's weird but it
didn't and I'm driving me crazy I could
do it but um but yeah I did wear this
one day and I really did like it had a
really nice lasting power i used the
pink and that's how that looks there
that's how that looks there so those are
the two swatches and let me swatch here
and i don't know if you can see my egg
nails i made bacon and egg nails I
actually they were supposed to be
flowers but then I decided that it
looked more like my dog scratching to go
out excuse him I'm gonna let him out a
second but I looked at it and I was like
you know what it doesn't really look
like flowers it looks more like you know
sunny side up eggs so I put some bacon
on the other side just for the fun of it
so that's the deal with that but anyway
back to the swatches those are the two
swatches the pink and then like the more
nudie kind of color I'm going to let the
dog out I'll be right back so we'll do a
little brush swatch I love this brush
because it's got the little point at the
top if you find this elf blush brush at
you know your drugstore totally get it
it's totally worth it a dollar or
whatever oh my gosh is amazing okay so
we'll do the pink one first okay would
you suck at
okay let's do the peachy color
so those that's how those watch I mean
and and on the cheeks you really do it
really is pretty pigmented and the
lasting power was actually really nice
on these I was very something I was very
excited about that I got is the
strivectin antioxidant defense lotion
now everything I've ever gotten from
strivectin has been from new Beauty test
tube and I only got the same thing twice
and it was like a spot cream or
something like that and I've always
wanted to try some news from Tribeca
that I could actually use now I am
disappointed in the sample size I don't
think i'm going to be able to get too
much out of this it is a lotion so i
might be able to get like two uses out
of it I can see the product goes to
about here on here because of my lights
I can kind of see through it's a point
25 fluid ounce i would imagine the full
size would be a full ounce but you know
this stuff is stupid expensive so i've
always wanted to try try it without
having to pay the full price so that's
really nice i'm excited to try that and
then there's two more things in here
this is the hmong gangoh nutrient
defense anti-aging lip conditioner and i
did have this in my pocket one day and i
really liked it a lot now I read on the
FC website the reviews for this some
people really hated the sin some people
really like the set I personally like
the scent I like the son of lemon and I
really feel like it moisturize my lips
are very very nicely one thing I always
look is what is the number one
ingredient in a lip balm I really like
to see shea butter I would like to see
how hoba I really like to see you know
some of those ingredients this one has
sunflower oil and then beeswax I wish
that beeswax was first and then the
cocoa butter and then the sunflower oil
but not quite as moisturizing but
overall really did like this and we'll
be using it I'm a lip lip balm junkie so
and then the last thing in here is the
Lord and bury a silk kajal kohl eyeliner
in black and I am wearing that on my
waterline I used on my eyeliner today I
used actually from the Naked 2 palette
the black that's in there and used a
just like a I don't know I'll show you
just like this angled liner brush here
and just applied with some eyeshadow and
then I use this on my waterline and just
tightened up my wing a little bit with
it and I really like the way that
applied I know people are complaining
this is like the teenies Tiny's eyeliner
ever happy to try it and this I mean
this much eyeliner is going to last me a
long time I mean I don't go through
eyeliners that fast so I am thankful to
have it even though
is a smaller sample I really don't care
because just because of the how much
time it takes me to go through my
eyeliner okay my friends I know I'm
wearing a different outfit but it's the
same night just that's just what I do I
know you're in the middle of watching
the Ipsy video but I realized now an
hour and a half after I shot that video
that i forgot to show you the perversion
I lot I thought perversion mascara and
that I got that and I need to show you
that so I'm just going to suck it up and
show you and I'm not going to change
back into that shirt because that's just
lame but this is the perversion Urban
Decay mascara I did do a full review on
this on the full size of it I am wearing
it today I do really like it a lot if
you want to see how it applies with the
subversion lash primer i will link that
video down below but for me i really
like this mascara a lot i like the way
it lengthens my lashes i like the way
that it volumizes my lashes and it
doesn't flake on me and it lasts for me
like I I've seen some people say that
they don't like it doesn't work for them
but for me and my lashes it definitely
works for me I've really been enjoying
it so now back to the other outfit and
the rest of that video so and I didn't
talk about the bag the bag is like a
little pencil case thing I probably well
I'm going to start putting I think these
bags in like for my students as like
little prizes and things if they want to
have like a little bags I think this
would be cute like a little pencil case
for like a girl in my class I think they
would really like this so i think i'm
going to take this to work and give this
week so i just have so many little bags
that I just you know I don't need that
many and I just think that's really cute
you know with the orange and the white i
love that contrast between those two
colors they complement each other
contrast or complement what do they do
make up your mind I don't know whatever
they do I like the way it looks so
really really happy to have this bag but
will probably be giving it away so in
summary i got the Lord Barry I Leonard
that I actually really like so far
strivectin that I'm anxious to try the
Mangaung go a lip balm low value product
but i like it and i got the Coastal
Scents forever blush which again low
value product but I like the way that it
works and that is that it so overall do
I think this was worth ten dollars
absolutely i really do I mean between
this and this I mean and even the blush
I mean adding
all these things up I mean these are
this is definitely worth ten bucks is it
worth a lot more to me than ten bucks no
not really I would say to me this is
worth about fifteen dollars maybe twenty
i know it has a monetary value of more
than that but drop my liner cool he's
almost blended in because it's so Danny
but I mean I definitely think I got ten
dollars worth of product so I am happy
with this MC bag isn't my favorite bag
ever now it's not but it's a good bag
it's definitely a good solid bag so
