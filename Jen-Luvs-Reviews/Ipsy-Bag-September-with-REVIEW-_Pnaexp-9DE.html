final video in the series of beauty box
subscriptions that I receive this month
and this was the first time I ever
received beauty box subscriptions in the
mail so I was super excited to get these
and the final one is my lamb bag / epsy
bag they just changed their names epsy
which i think is a very strange name I
would not name my company if see it just
sounds like something you would jump
rope to or something I'd like some kind
of toy company like it just doesn't
sound glamorous or glorious to me at all
one thing I'm going to show you that I
got in the bag that I think is so cool
is they have some of the people that
make Beauty videos they have their
pictures all around the outside of this
card people that subscribe to the
service I mean I guess they don't all
make Beauty videos but I guess they
asked them to send in pictures to put on
this card and one of my favorite
subscriptions right now his her name Oh
youtube name is Donnie sweetie she's
right oh I don't know if you can see her
she's right there and that was so
exciting for me to see her because it's
like oh I know her sort of i watch your
videos that's so cool I was pretty happy
with this bag and I'm looking forward to
getting my next bag because it came with
some cool stuff now this stuff came in a
bunch of different packaging that I did
not save um so it you're just gonna see
what I kept out of it the actual product
for the most part the first thing I am
going to show you is something that I
did not really try it is the Carol's
Daughter split and repairing split end
sealer um I don't really have split ends
my friend Amy does my hair for me every
eight weeks so my hair really gets well
taken care of she's amazing so I didn't
really get a chi
to use this um I will tell you a little
bit about it it's a spray and this is
what it oh that did not go well okay
it's not a spray i only use this once
can you tell it just totally dripped on
my pants okay so so anyway so it's a
little squirt bottle it's a giant sample
really big sample and that's what it
comes out looking like it smells what
kind of beachy and I guess you're
supposed to spread it on your hair and
it's supposed to make your split ends go
away but I don't really know what to do
with that I'm gonna probably put it on
my four-year-old at some point and try
it on her I should have done that before
this video but I don't know she's
squiggly and squirmy and putting things
on her hair is like I don't know to get
hurt I guess I probably could I don't
know I might review this again in
another video if it actually does
anything if it doesn't do anything then
you'll never hear about it again the
next thing that I got which I really
liked was this Marabella I shadow and it
is in a I hate to call it this but it's
like a dirt brown color like like like
flower bed dirt color it's gorgeous for
a crease color and let me swatch that
for you it's very soft let's see how
that's almost like a dirt color I know
that sounds terrible but it really is
pretty when it goes on and I actually
have it like over here mixed into my
crease you might not be able to see it
right now because I have a color covered
in other things um but yeah it's it's a
nice color and I'm really happy with
this I'm happy with how it stays on it
stays on really really well I mean it is
an all-day shadow so next up we got the
smudge brush and I feel like you can
never have too many brushes like this um
what I've been using this for is um when
I want to blend a color this is really
nice to grab because I'm not putting any
shadow on this I'm not going to use it
as a shadow brush I'm just going to use
it as a blending brush and it works very
nice and this is by London New York soho
london new york I don't know you know I
never know how to read those goofy
things when they have the words all like
i don't know i'm gonna say soho london
new york is what i'm going to guess is
the order of those words and i know they
sell these i think i saw them at ulta
and they're not super expensive but i
really do like this brush it's very soft
it's very dense and i'm enjoying using
it so this is definitely company that
i'm going to check out more products
from the next thing that i wanted to
show you and I met my nails are just
falling apart right now I so need to
read you my nails and I should have
redone this video but I just don't feel
like it um but we got a circus nail
polish which I've seen in other my glam
bags and the deal with this I really
like the color but it dried so stinkin
flat it was like the flattest it looks
like we'll be shimmery in the bottle I
mean not shimmery but at least you know
some kind of shine or something in the
bottle guess because of the glass but it
tries very very mad very mad so I felt
like I needed to put some kind of
sparkle or something on top of it so
that's what I ended up doing so now posh
was okay the lasting power of it was
okay it's in the color tightrope by the
way um so oh it's by andrea's choice but
yeah I don't think I'm gonna be going
out of my way to purchase these if I saw
them on sale somewhere i might purchase
them but um definitely i'm going to go
out of my way to buy another one of
these alright the final thing that i got
in my bag I saved my favorite for less
was the jane sparkle lip gloss and this
is a color I would never have bought in
a million years I would have never
bought this color because it is bright
neon pink but I'm going to put on for
you so you can see what it looks like
hopefully I do cake somewhere we're
looking at mirror it's the office of
this turned into the no mirror makeup
challenge like it's like this pop in
pink definitely with a different shirt
I'll hide oh here's you can
see my shirt it's very bright and
vibrant without screaming so loud oh my
gosh she's got pink on her lips ah yeah
it looks it looks really red but it's
really not that I guess doesn't look
that bad but I'm really had with us it
is a little bit sticky but nothing
obnoxious it feels very thick on my lips
it's definitely doesn't feel
moisturizing it all but it feels thick
and the smell the smell is very mild um
kind of candy snow but very mild nothing
crazy this is the end of the series of
my three Beauty boxes that i got for the
