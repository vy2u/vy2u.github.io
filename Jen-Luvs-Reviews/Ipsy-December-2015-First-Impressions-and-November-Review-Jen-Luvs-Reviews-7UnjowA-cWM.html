hello my friends welcome to my review of
my November FC bag and my unbanning ish
of the December epsy bag I love love
love this format because you not only
get to see what I got my bags but you
also get to hear full reviews on
everything I got in my previous bag so
let's go ahead and jump right into what
I got in my November bag this is not
said to me for review I pay for this out
right just like everybody else so let's
go ahead into the products that I got
first I got the novex brazilian keratin
extra deep hair cream this is a
wonderful wonderful conditioner what I
do with it which is maybe not exactly
what you're supposed to do with it but i
like it is that I'll shampoo my hair
I'll put some of this in my hair after I
shampoo it throw my hair up in like a
pony tale ish thing in the shower and
then I will wash the rest of my body do
everything else that I'm supposed to do
then I'll pull my hair down and wash it
rinse it out until you give it some time
to set in my hair and it works
wonderfully like that there may be some
things about putting ponytail holders in
your hair while it's wet there probably
isn't very good to do with your hair but
that's what I do so that's what I'm
telling you I do because I'm not ashamed
I'm not ashamed of using a ponytail
holder in my hair while it's wet so I'm
just going to tell you that use your
beware but overall this is a wonderful
product highly recommend this next thing
I'm pulling out is the Smashbox full
exposure mascara this is a really really
nice mascara the only thing that I do
want to warn you about is that the one
is ginormous so if you have small eyes
you may not enjoy this the full size is
quite pricey I do feel like you can get
drugstore options that will do the exact
same thing as this but it really is a
wonderful mascara so if you are looking
for let's get it flipped around the
right way if you're looking for a really
good more expensive mascara i would
recommend trying this one no flaking no
smudging lengthening volumizing
separating all of that goodness but I do
think there's drugstore options that are
just as good if you're not sure what
those drugstore options are you can
check out my 2015 favor
video that will be listed down below I
have a couple options in that video
alright inspir eyes shadow I was really
pleasantly surprised with this this is
in the shade carnival and I use this in
my crease even though it is kind of a I
would say it's a suede color I wouldn't
say that it's really satin I guess it's
kind of satiny it's more like a suede
and it worked really well as a
transition color which I'm surprised
because usually I like a nice matte
transition color but because it isn't
shimmering it's got a little bit of a
shine to it but it's not shimmery it
worked really well up in the crease so I
use this from many many looks this month
and I've really been enjoying it I'm
curious to try some more products from
the inspiron because I was so impressed
with this eyeshadow very very creamy
very easy to use very blendable works
well with other shadows long wearing all
of that good stuff definitely a good
product excited about it and then in
here is when I'm wearing on my lips
today this is the tristique mini matte
lip crayon and chili red and it looks
strange because when you first get a
tristique product in your glam bag or
when you buy one it's like oh my
goodness it's open its going to get
everywhere that's just the packaging
this is what it looks like inside and I
do really like this it's not super
moisturizing where time is pretty good I
haven't worn I've only one at one other
time other than this and it was really
just to test it because I don't wear
these kinds of shades on the daily these
are more filming shades for me and I
haven't really even use it for filming I
do want to wear it today I'm wearing for
the second time today but overall it
seems very nice it but it's not
moisturizing just be aware of that and
the where time is very nice it wears
down pretty evenly it does take a couple
of layers if you want that truly opaque
shade it doesn't when it first goes on
it's a tad bit on the Shearer side so
just be aware that you may need a double
layer of it if you like that opaque look
there is absolutely no scent to it at
all it's completely senseless I do not
smell anything then the last thing I got
in my epsy bag was this liquid gossamer
by jelly pong pong cosmetics I'm not a
big fan of this I know some people
really enjoyed it
if you use it with a stippling brush it
tends to go a little bit better into the
skin but i like to use my highlighter
just with my finger and kind of blend it
in and I just didn't feel like this if
you'll get sat on my skin unless I use
the stippling brush I mean you can make
it work but I don't think that I would
purchase this or recommend purchasing
this unless you have a stippling brush
to go with it to kind of get it to blend
into your skin but if you can get it to
work it is very beautiful I'll swatch it
for you oh it's exploding so it just
kind of sits there on top of the skin if
you can see how that works so that was
my November bag overall I feel like was
a really good bag I mean just these two
products alone I would definitely pay
ten dollars for if I flip it the right
way I would definitely pay ten dollars
just for these two products alone
they're both wonderful and then this is
also really really fun to try this kind
of pushes it over the edge these two I
could kind of do without just because of
the shade isn't really a shade I wear
very often but it's a really nice
product if you like that shade and then
this I probably wouldn't purchase at all
that's just my personal opinion so let's
go ahead and move on to what I got in my
December Ipsy bag ok so in December we
did get an extra gift in our epsy bags
from Michelle Phan if you've been
subscribed for at least I think it was
three years to three years I subscribed
at like maybe the eighth if see back i
just subscribed in the first year so i
think that's why I got this it did come
with a little note from Michelle it says
hi dreamer and then it just talks about
did you know that you're one of the
first to subscribe to the glam bag I
consider you one of the founding member
of FC you shared this dream and all
these wonderful things in the show
always says that are very fluffy and
frou-frou and happy and kumbaya ish and
and I do thank Michelle for sending this
to to us I think that was very very kind
of her it did come with some application
tools that I promptly lost I don't know
what I did with them I have used this on
my eyes twice since I got it and I feel
like the shades are nice um the formula
isn't my favorite I don't feel like it's
super creamy I don't feel like it's
super easy to work with but it's
definitely nicer than your average
drugstore palette it's I would compare
this in quality to like morphy
eyeshadows or more feeI shadows
you know where they're good but they're
not like blow you away Mary al the
pallets are similar to this I do feel
like the lasting power on this is better
than the Loreal the pallets but I mean
overall it's not a great formula for me
but it is a good formula and I'm very
thankful to her I really like the bag
for December the bag that they gave us
it's got the cute little lips for epsy I
think it's super cute some people were
saying it's kind of boring but I think
it's really cute things that I got in
here that I have tried so far the honey
moisture mask with propolis extract I'm
really enjoying this I'm not a big
masked fan but this is really more of a
moisturizer than a mask what you do with
it is you put it all over your face kind
of thick you let it sit there for 20
minutes and then you rub in the excess
it smells like real honey like not that
stuff you put on your biscuits to KSC
you know what I mean it's like real like
honey honey out of the hive and you can
really smell it very very strong when
you put it on your face if you don't
like that sent you probably will not
enjoy using this I personally love that
scent so I don't mind it it feels great
on the skin and then rubbing it in it
feels very nice it does get a little bit
tacky at first once you do that 20
minutes and you rub it in it feels a
little bit tacky but in about five
minutes that feels like it goes away and
I have been sleeping with this on my
face the past few nights and have really
been enjoying it'll then we got
something that I have not tried yet this
is the chlorine Oh floral floral water
makeup remover let's read the English
version Jen I have not used this yet but
I'm excited to use it i left chlorine as
a brand i love their dry shampoo it's
fantastic so I'm really excited to try
this let me smell it for you smells very
sweet and a little bit floral so I'm
curious to try this and see how it works
and then I did try this also this is the
formula X nail polish and this is in the
shade revved up I use this I put this on
my nails this chipped within less than
24 hours this chipped and I did use the
formula X the system under half of my
nails I did every other nail on both
hands I did one two three on this hand
with the system and then I did 12 on
this hand with the system and then some
with just a top of base and top coat
straily basin top coat I saw no
difference using the formula X the
system with it
if you don't know what the system is
it's a cleanser and then a base coat and
then a top coat from formula X and I
wanted to know whether that would help
this lasting power and I can tell you it
absolutely did not this is definitely a
fail nail polish for me unless you want
to reapply it every single day maybe
even more than once a day it shipped so
fast I'm so disappointed in this really
disappointed I do want to use it for
nail stamping and see if that is a
better use for this but as far as a
straight nail polish total fail total
fail alright next thing in here I got
was a concealer brush by beau gah she's
I don't how to pronounce that G ACH is
and this is just the concealer brush I
don't particularly like concealer
brushes the flat kind I've heard that
it's very flat kinds of brushing very
good for applying masks but I just I
don't know I just I'm not a big fan of
this Stella brush I will use it and try
it out for review purposes but I wasn't
very excited to see this in my bag and
then the last thing that we got was a
pacifica lip product which also i have
not tried yet this is a beautiful shade
it is in the shade nudie red and I'll
swatch it on my hand for you it feels
very creamy and it smells like plastic
but I like Pacifica as a brand so I'm
really excited to try this I'm hoping
that the plastic scent goes away as you
use it though sometimes it sits on the
lips and you can smell it for a really
long time and sometimes it dissipates
pretty quickly so I'm curious to see how
this is going to wear on the lips there
will be a feel whew that there will be a
