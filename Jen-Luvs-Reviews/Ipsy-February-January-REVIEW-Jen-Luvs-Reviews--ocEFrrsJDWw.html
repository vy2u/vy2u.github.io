close my eyes I have to look at myself
yes I can close my eyes hello my friends
welcome to my review of the January FC
bag and my let me show you what I got in
my februari FC bag I just got this today
so I haven't had a lot of time to play
with it but this girlfriend or boyfriend
I have a lot to tell you about the
things that came in my January MC bag so
let's go ahead and get started I do pay
for this out right this has not sent me
for promotion just so you know as you
know I always provide you with an honest
review so the first thing that I got in
here is in Hanalei sugar lip scrub and I
was not impressed with this at all um it
is like straight up oil number one and
because it's so oily the grit is just
not there like you can feel the sugar
there but it's like really weak even the
amount of grit that's in there and it
just doesn't it does it in order to get
enough grit to exfoliate you have to oil
the ridiculousness out of your lips like
to the point where you're just like a
grease ball like its disgusting like in
order to exfoliate isn't moisturizing
yes absolutely but I don't think this is
a very good lip scrub the sense of it is
mildly minty but it's not overpowering
but I really did not enjoy this as a lip
scrub at all I will use it just as a
moisturizer for my lips but I will not
use it as a scrub it's not effective at
least for me anyway the next thing in
here was this little peek eyebrow little
pocket e little thing it's very cute
it's the wrong color for me it is very
light for me I mean you can see how dark
my brows are and how light that is it's
just too light it doesn't work I want to
try to use it as an eyeshadow i haven't
tried to use it as a matte eyeshadow but
i think that's what i'm going to end up
using it for it definitely doesn't work
for me for my brows just the wrong shade
wrong shade or i might just pass it on
with something with lighter hair and
then the next thing i got was the mr.
right now eyeliner pencil in scott this
actually works really well for me i've
heard a lot of people saying they did
not like there's I really like mine a
lot I got a burgundy
shade the only thing is is I don't like
it very much in my lower lash line
because it does have a red tone to it
and I feel like it makes my eyes look
bloody and I don't like that at all um
but as far as the formula i really like
it it's very creamy as very opaque it
lasts all day on my upper lash line on
my lower lash line it lasts for a long
time in my waterline but not all day it
does last time I lash line all day which
is very very nice so overall I really
like this a lot I did hear some people
didn't like it though which surprised me
another thing that I didn't like was the
jake a beauty blinky shimmer I show and
this shocked me because I've pretty much
liked everything I've ever gotten from
Jake at beauty I you got a ton of stuff
from that one point that they sent me
for review and I really liked everything
this I did not like it all when i
swatched and I was like yes look at that
oh my god is so amazing oh my gosh like
gorgeous right when i put on my eyes it
was so patchy it was ridiculous i was
kidding me man big fail like I couldn't
believe how patch it was I do want to
try this with some different primers
I've used it with the Urban Decay primer
potion I've used it alone I've used it
with what i use it with i also use it
with my ELF primer and I used it with my
Myka beauty primer and none of them like
I don't like it but i do want to try it
with some other primers just to make
sure because i just can't let go with
the fact that just did that to my hands
I can't let go of that fact but I can't
let go of that this thing stinks like it
makes me upset because I love Jake at
beauty this oh by the way this is a
shade tangerine light it's number 102
and I like the shade I just didn't like
the formula and I'm very sad about it
and then the last thing is what I'm
wearing on my lips today and this is the
tristique mini matte lip crayon in
Florence fig and I love this alone I
love it it's a me color I love the color
I love the way it feels lasting power is
really good it's of course not like an
all day thing but it wears down really
really nicely it doesn't give like any
kind of weird funk or anything going on
and no patchiness like it wears down
very nicely it's just a really nice lip
product smell wise doesn't really have a
set which is a good thing for a lot of
people out people don't like sense in
their lip products that's really good I
definitely want to try more of these I
real
enjoyed this a lot so overall and I'm
kind of on the fence here with the Ipsy
bag I mean I did not like the this was
the wrong shade for me this I did not
like it was she a Lee this I did not
like it was too patchy but I really
liked the eye pencil and I really like
the lip product and I feel like these
two products alone were worth the ten
dollars so for me the FC bag was a wind
this was a twenty-dollar subscription
girlfriend I would not been happy but
for 10 bucks I think we're in good shape
so let me go ahead and show you what I
got in my febuary bag and this will be
reviewed about this time next month so
one thing i did try i cheated and i
tried it I put it on my eyes tonight
this is the naked cosmetic Sierra Nevada
Mike a pigment I put on my eyes I just
slapped it on there and it is like glowy
beautifulness I have to look at myself I
can't just close my eyes I have to look
at myself yes I can close my eyes but my
big complaint about this is when I
opened it it's like super messy so i
can't speak to lasting power at all all
i can speak to is that this pot is a
mess thankfully they had it taped up
pretty nicely with some nice packaging
to like tape it up but as so messy got
everywhere all over my makeup table it
seems to be very glowy I mean the it's
gorgeous it's absolutely gorgeous but I
need to wear it for a full day to give a
full review on it and I haven't done
that yet this is also something that
I've tried just on my hands one time
this is the candies vanilla hand and
body lotion buy more and it says its
enriched with almond extract and argan
oil this smells amazing in the tube I'm
not sure how much I like it on my hands
it seems to get kind of plasticky on my
hands but I want to try it more I want
to try it more more imma try it one this
I really am excited about trying this is
the new photo finish primer oil by
snatch box oh my gosh so excited to try
that don't know anything about an
abnormal skin so I have no problem
putting oil on my face no problem at all
so this is the jerrell parker perfume
and this smells very nice it's an oh so
divine and i really love the way that
smells it smells very girly it's got a
little bit of a floral scent I know I'm
not supposed to smell it that way home
on me let me smell like this put it on
my hand instead I can't smell it right
now my nose is just not
working but I want to try this I like
the initial cent of it but I definitely
want to try it it seems very floral so
I'm curious to see whether I'm going to
actually like that and then the last
thing in here that I'm excited to try is
this trust fund beauty nail polish I got
one of these I think in an FC bag before
I think it's a purple one really liked
it a lot this one is called i'm kind of
a big deal and it's pink and i'm very
excited to try this so yes win on that
