late to the game on my MC bag I got this
early last week but I don't get it time
to shoot videos until the weekend so I
had to wait until later in order to
shoot this but I'm so excited to open up
my October FC bag please excuse the
children's chitter chatter in the
background there are some cards in here
to show you those real quick i'm not
going to read them all to you but this
is um it's the art of beauty is the
theme for this month and they have all
of the brands on the back so i got a
nourish organic coconut and Argan body
lotion let's smell so this smells like
smells coconutty a little beachy kind of
smell but not suntan lotion ii
interesting let me see what it feels
like doesn't feel greasy feels pretty
nice absorbs pretty quickly smells
coconutty i really really like this cool
next up i see offres lip gloss plumper
in sultry plumber's are usually the ones
that have that minty feel to them see
what this comes out looking like so that
is the swatch on that let's put it on
it's a thick formula but very minimally
sticky not really sticky though smooth
not to whaley you like the color um I've
gotten I know we've gotten I got a large
I shadow from offer once from a beauty
box not sure if it was epsy or not but
it was a strange color it was like a
golden bronzy color what was very very
warm too warm for my skin tone but it
was gigantic I actually don't feel the
plumping on my lips as much as I thought
that I would it's not that cold feeling
or that tingly feeling that you
sometimes get in plumper plumpie plumper
II plomberie lip glosses yeah we'll go
with plomberie so I'm actually very
happy with this excited about that oh I
love joy at nail polishes I saw some
other people got away in a posh but I
wasn't sure if they were in all of the
boxes or just some of the boxes or bag
let's say that one's
this is in Mason and my friend amy
nicole on keek she got this one and did
swatches on her keek and it was gorgeous
so I am really really excited to try
this once i get rid of this orange this
is the one that i got in my Birchbox
that is a purple and it's got some like
some pink glitters in it and it looks
like it might have some like like it
like pink maybe iridescent sin there
it's really cool everyone's might get
isaiah polish it takes three coats to
get an opaque but for the most part i
will loved every so a polish that I've
ever gotten all right next up we have by
h2o a hydrating treatment oil-free
marine hydration face oasis so it's just
a face cream I'm anxious to try this I'm
always looking for new face creams to
try oh it's like a gel that's weird I've
never seen a face cream it's a gel here
it's got a very on spa smell to it like
oceany clean spa but it says after
cleansing massage gently into damp face
and neck so it is like a moisturizer
weird I've never seen a gel moisturizer
it's very cooling to the touch strange
strange strange product but I will
definitely try it I'm anxious to try it
I i found that h2o is very hit-or-miss
as far as the products i found some
really good products by them and some
ones that didn't work for me okay last
up is style sexy hair spray clay shot
one shine seven hold whatever that means
I don't really need a product like this
just based on my hairstyle i am getting
my hair done a couple days i'm very
excited so maybe once i get my haircut I
will need something like this but I
don't know I might pass this on to
someone who actually has a hair that
needs to be styled and played overall
I'm very happy with what I got in my
Ipsy bag i am not a fan of this i am
very excited about the lip product i am
starting to feel that cooling sensation
of my lips it was delayed but i am
feeling it but it's not a strong cooling
feeling very happy about the ZOA polish
i'm happy to try the h2o cream and happy
about my lotion for 10 bucks I am so
happy with this FC bag I mean just as
oya polish alone is worth nine dollars
