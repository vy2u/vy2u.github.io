together that's the best I can do for
that hello my friends welcome to my
December epsy bag review and my let's
see what I got in my January bag it's
not none bagging it's just uh let's see
what I got my January bag that will be
perfuming next month and if C is if you
do not know ten dollars a month it is a
monthly beauty subscription service I do
not get this for review or promotion I'm
not paid to do this video I pay for this
bag out right and as always my promise
to you is an honest review so let me go
ahead and get into what I got in my
December bag the first thing was the
thing that I am the most happy with and
this is the honey moisture mask with
propolis extract by lather and I really
love this product I can show you how
much I loved it it is completely and
totally gone the smell of it smells
similar to honey but a little more
earthy than honey what it's made out of
is the glue that the bees used to kind
of make the hive to make everything
stick together it's also an
antimicrobial and it keeps pests away
things like that from the hive and kind
of protects the hive so there are some
claims about how this can help to um you
know it use it has antibiotic properties
and things for your skin and there's
definitely some really interesting
beauty claims in bee propolis so I don't
know whether it did any of that stuff
all i know is i really enjoyed using it
i really like this smell the smell is
very strong though so if you're you
think you might be sensitive that you
probably won't like this i would
consider buying a full size of this now
this is supposed to be used as a mask
meaning you're supposed to put it on
thick and according to the directions
and then you're supposed to rub in any
excess after 10 minutes I ended up
finding that to be a little unnecessary
and also it made me go through the
product too fast so I ended up just
using this kind of like a moisturizer
and I really enjoyed it a lot it was fun
to use and I'm definitely considering
buying a full side x up we got a
concealer I am NOT a big fan of this
kind of style brush it is very soft it's
appropriate for this kind of brush I
just don't prefer this kind
I've used it for concealer some but I do
still feel like I need to pad out the
concealer after I use this this can also
be used for eye cream things like that
but again I still feel the need to Pat
with my finger afterward I just feel
like it doesn't blend well like I can't
get it to do what it's supposed to do
without poking myself in the eyeball so
maybe if I practice more with it I would
get better at it but it's just not a
preferred brush shape for me so I
probably could have done without this
one this is by the way by bo gosh she's
i think is the way you pronounce that
paris and it's the concealer brush next
in my bag was another fail this was the
formula x nail polish in the shade
revved up this is a mini and i really do
like formula x nail polishes overall
I've had very good experiences every
once won't have a bad experience this
happened to be a bad experience it went
on beautifully absolutely gorgeous this
did not last 12 hours on my nails
without a chip by 24 hours it was a hot
mess so bad that I had to take it off
and i did use formula access the system
with it to make sure that i was giving
it the proper formula x treatment that
is a cleanser a base coat and a top coat
made by formula x because i wanted to
make sure i gave it a fair shot with
their products and it still didn't help
it's just really not a good formula and
i was very sad because it's gorgeous
color it's a bad for me next that was
another product that was just okay for
me this is the chlorine floral water
makeup remover i did put this
head-to-head with my bioderma it doesn't
even come close to how good my bioderma
is i haven't tried the Garnier for the
micellar water yet but this is just not
i'm assuming supposed to be like on my
solar water and it's just not um it it
puts a dent in my makeup but I feel like
I need a lot more effectiveness and I
love chlorine as a brand I loved a lot
of their products I just didn't love
this problem and the last thing in here
was something I really wanted to love
this is the pacifica natural minerals
power of love powerful color color
natural lipstick in the shade nudie red
I don't know where they get red from us
this is Newt there's nothing but nude
going on here there's no red that's a
nude and this is a new that I love I
love this color it is very creamy
it is long lasting for a lipstick it is
not a lip stain or anything but it is it
lasts very nicely where's pretty well
the problem with this is this is
probably one of the worst smelling
lipsticks I've ever smelled in my entire
life it may have something to do with
the natural ingredients that are in it
but I just could not get past the snow
because the snow not only smells bad in
the tube but it lingers on the lips and
it just smells really bad like bad burnt
plastic not burnt like I imagined like
like burnt marshmallows and plastic put
together that's the best I can do for
that I don't like it at all so
unfortunately this was a fail for me as
well now you're gonna be surprised
though my review of this bag this bag is
cute by the way I really like this I
actually would pay ten dollars for this
and let me tell you why I patos ten
dollars this I would not want that this
was terrible but this I loved loved
loved loved loved loved and these I
would have wanted to try these are
products i was interested in so just the
try factor and very very happy that I
got a chance to try these I've wanted to
try more things from Pacifica and
chlorine I got to try them so even
though the only win was this I still
think it was worth my personal ten
dollars a month so my friend let's go
ahead and go into the January bag I'm
not going to review any of these
products today I have not fully tested
them so I'm gonna put the subscribe
button there so that you can make sure
to hit that so you don't miss next
month's video where I actually review
all of these products so the first thing
in here is the tristique mini matte lip
crayon in Florence fig I will swatch
that for you well look at that it's
almost the same color as the Pacifica
isn't that interesting if she must know
what kind of lip colors I like cuz I
like these guys of color so I'm happy
with that next in here is this little
peak eyebrow product it is in espresso
it is a natural Steen brow powder little
baby reminds me of like little cigar box
from old-timey it's very cute little tin
next is the Hanalei sugar lip scrub and
there
is that a very very mild minty ish
beachy kind of sense there and then the
blinky shimmer eyeshadow in tangerine
light by Jake at beauty and I'll swatch
that for you by Bam Bam Bam Bam shiny
shiny shiny and then finally in here i
have the mr. right now by the bomb and
this is in the shade scott and i will
swatch you that they're very creamy i
think it got smushed inside the cap a
little bit so that's why i was flaking a
little bit but very very creamy there
and that is my january bag again i will
be reviewing that next month so make
sure you subscribe so you don't miss it
thank you so much for watching mad love
and i'll see you in a video soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
