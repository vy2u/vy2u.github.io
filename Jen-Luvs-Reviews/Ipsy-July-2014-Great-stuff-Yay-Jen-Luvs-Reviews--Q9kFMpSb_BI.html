seabag finally coming to you I was on
vacation so I didn't have time to film
but Laila's gonna join us for the Ipsy
bag opening and see what's inside she's
drinking a Chia squeeze their amazing so
if see if you don't already know is 10
bucks a month and that's including
shipping it's kind of a hit or miss
thing sometimes we get some amazing
products and there's sometimes it's like
not like wall but honestly I always feel
like I get my ten dollars worth always I
don't it's very rare about always but
it's very rare that I feel like I didn't
get my money's worth out of FC so anyway
let's go ahead and open this baby up and
see we got okay this is something that I
got has with my Ipsy points this is a
glam RX it's like a little Z palette to
a magnetic palette and you put like the
magnetic eyeshadows in their mac
eyeshadows hitting our magnetic makeup
geek eyeshadows and then it got a little
mirror in there so thank you to those of
you who have used my link and signed up
thanks to you I was able to get that so
thank you so much and then we have the
card this card other than knowing that
this theme is sensationally sunkissed
it's completely useless if she gives
most useless cards it gives no good
information all it is promotion for MC
which is a little annoying alright
bareminerals not your ordinary shadow
new five and one BB advanced performance
cream eyeshadow hopefully there is one
of these in there because I am super
excited about this product hopefully
it's a color that i will wear free
shipping at ulta.com with any bare
minerals purchase and also right now i
just got an email my email I just got a
coupon code for twenty percent off from
old so I might be using that
see I hope you can use to code you
probably can't alright the bag this
month look at this bag while up what do
you like this bag I like the scalloped
edges here this is neat we just when we
went on vacation I had like five FC bags
hold on us but they really came in handy
for travel um no weird funky smell a
little bit of smell but nothing like
offensives it smell funny I'll okay a
little bit weird plasticky all right you
want to open at me oh did I introduce my
love this is Lila she's my six-year-old
she's awesome um okay so the first thing
I see John is he's going to be three
tomorrow in real time which is way long
time ago on flight 26 all right first
thing in here tits and sass oh that was
close but I don't want to say that in
front of child tinson SAS cheery my
Elizabeth mot it's a fabulous lip and
cheek stain i have not had much luck
with product like this hopefully Olympic
Elizabeth Martin will pull through it
looks like the what's called the bomb
stay niak or I think benefit has a
version of this see what okay is a joke
foot applicator okay so there is the
stain let's give it a second to dry blow
on it for me kiddo don't spit on it
you'll sweat it all over again all right
now let's see it get it stained yep
staying pretty good so it's got a really
nice mild sent you at a cherry cherry
scent smell mmm smells good baby I'm
anxious to try this very thankful to
have this one here this is a hang ten
dark tanning wheel so are you supposed
sunscreen SPF eight okay so it's got a
very low SPF I'm surprised even still
make dark tanning oil okay so you put it
on your body and when you go out in the
Sun it's supposed to make your skin tan
faster you want to pull the next thing
out yes okay here go pull the next thing
out see what's in it
ooh ok this is the bare minerals this is
the five and one BB advanced performance
cream eyeshadow I'm very excited to try
this super duper Burke say let's see
what color we got we got a dark one and
year-long bia mode please ignore it ok
so this one is called sweet spice I
believe it's either sweet spice or
divine wine I'm trying to hold it up and
see any divine you think divine wine
let's key I think it's divine one I
think you're right it doesn't actually
say on here I don't believe ok but let's
watch it as well are you know what
that's not that's not too bad does it
blend and it blends that actually is
going to be pretty fun to play what I'm
just going to have this kind of round it
does look kind of brown but I think
that's going to be a nice color it
reminds me of Kristen game taupe so I
like the way that it blends out this is
going to be really fun to play with you
know Bubba all right oh you're
waterproof big lash mascara I have a
stupid amount of mascaras open right now
like a stupid amount like a lot yeah so
stupid enough and I'm not talking about
a person is stupid and talking about a
lot of mascaras so I'm naturally not
going to open this but this packaging is
gorgeous it reminds me of the mac like
that water yeah it's like water droplets
like the mat collection has the water
droplets on there that's really pretty I
like that I'm not I want to open it but
I can't and it says it has argan oil in
it which I guess would be good for your
lashes as well as other hair I guess but
anxious to try this whenever I do open
it this will go in line with all the
other mascaras that I want to try and
open ah yeah this is an awesome if she
died I'm really excited about this one
ok I think there's one more thing inside
what is that be fine oh they used to
have these on little black bag they had
little see
guys these things daily moisturizer with
SPF 15 with rosemary pomegranate and
ruts Thanks I would never put rosemary
pomegranate and rice together in my mind
smells good though smell it smells good
that's like you want to put some on your
hands yeah it's lotion it's supposed to
be for your face we can put on your hand
and see how it feels yeah it doesn't it
doesn't get Christine you do get dry
skin in the wintertime all right rub it
and see how it feels yeah feels good
does it's got a nice very light scent to
it not super strong you're really
sensitive smells you probably won't like
it might be too strong for you but it
seeps in very nicely cool and I think
this stuff is like organic yet no
artificial colors no animal testing
whatsoever clinically and armitage no
dermatologically tested proven to be
safe and effective for all skin types
this was an awesome bag I'm loving this
bag I love that you love that one you
love the lotion I like back and it'll
keep your hands from aging which I know
is a concern of yours it's agent getting
old aren't you concerned about getting
old and having wrinkles what do you mean
you are yeah I know cuz Flanagan yeah
well it's gonna happen eventually and
it's not the end of the world it just
means that you're lucky enough to be
older but you live that long to get
wrinkles we may be thankful for our
wrinkles it means we were blessed with
more life
no not not this age wrinkles would look
really weird on you all right so in
summary we got the be fine food skincare
excited about that we got the tents at
SAS by Elisabeth Moss we got the mascara
by the big lash mascara by pure we got
the hang ten dark tan whale which is
probably what I'm least excited about at
the tanning oil and then we got the bare
minerals five and one eye shadow samples
to me this was definitely worth ten
bucks ah definitely i'm really excited
out these products and he signed about
the mascara I'm send about the 10th
excited about the eyeshadow LYLAS
excited about the skin cream which she
can always use it just says daily
moisturizer I don't see why she couldn't
use it on her hand so the only I'm not
excited about is this I'm gonna give
