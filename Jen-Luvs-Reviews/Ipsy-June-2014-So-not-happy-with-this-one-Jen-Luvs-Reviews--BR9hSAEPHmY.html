bag opening I am excited to open this
one my friend first thing i want to show
you that i did get i wasn't able to get
both of these but i was able to get one
of them and this is the chair where zoo
lip gloss and this one is in peony and i
will show you what that looks like oh i
saw old swatches from other videos that
i shot with a different shirt so on this
glorious lip gloss that I got with hip
see referral points thank you all so
much for setting up using my Ipsy link
so excited because of you I got this we
got a doe foot applicator with this and
mmm let's throw some of this on here I
thought it was going to be stickier than
it is but it's not sticking it's very
smooth how's that looking of course I
had other lip color on already but feels
good doesn't have a strong smell that i
have it on I can't really smell it let
me see if it has a smell here packaging
is pretty it's got aim not good smell
smells like makeup doesn't have a nice
smell when you put it wraps your nose
but I can't really smell it right now
while it's on my lips but if you're
sensitive those kind of things you might
not like this but oh no I'm very excited
to have it next I want to show you
what's actually in my epsy bag I'm
crossing my fingers for the Jessie's
Girl eyeliner I had pink eye and I had
to throw away my Jesse scroll eyeliner
and it is my favorite eyeliner so I'm
hoping I got one we will see and I
probably don't because well this is an
eyebrow pencil so maybe I still will I
just saw like another eyeliner and I was
like oh man okay so this is an eyebrow
pencil by offres and I do enjoy offer
lip glosses let's do a little swatch
nice nice offer a nice great okay
it keeps breaking inside of the
sharpener seriously I am NOT happy what
okay well I can't get it sharp and I
want to swatch it okay so that's a sharp
as I could get it right now I'm not
trying to have a break over and over
anymore feels very creamy which makes me
nervous and it's not super pigmented
either of course there's no way to know
how this is going to be all my actual
eyebrows until I try it but from my
experience creamy eyebrow products
typically don't work for me as well
because they tend to make my eyebrows
stick together like they kind of gel my
eyebrows so they don't look as natural I
prefer a dryer pencil formula to go on
because I feel like it kind of a lot of
times it'll kind of just attach to my
skin rather than to the actual brow
hairs so I'm not impressed with this so
far at all do I have a crackdown it okay
so you see that crack down there that's
why it keeps I think it I'm having so
much trouble with it right there so we
will see about that so far really not
impressed that and that makes me sad
because I've pretty much liked every
offer product that i've ever gotten this
is the first one that i am not impressed
with so that's kind of sad next I see a
shimmer eyeliner by nikka k and I do
enjoy their nail polishes we've gotten a
couple of nail polish for them and then
I did order some more nail polishes from
groupon from them and it looks like this
is it's a regular liquid eyeliner which
I'm not the biggest fan of I prefer like
the pen eyeliner but i do like these
occasionally that is very loud very very
loud with something like this what I'll
probably do is put this on next to my
lash line and then put a black a thin
black layer so it's just kind of a
stripe of blue and then black this would
be nice to wear like at the beach you
know when you're in kind of a not
typical situation there is no way that I
am wearing this to work or anything
daily younger people you know in their
teens early 20s can get more away with
things like this but this is neon
electric blue
I might be a little old for this product
so not happy so far okay haha i actually
already have this this is the NYX butter
gloss and not Eclair and i already own
this and i think it's right here no
that's cannella creampie Tremblay
where's my butter glosses okay it's
probably in my purse or someplace but i
already own this so you guys know what
that means when i already own something
or when I don't need something I give it
away so if you are interested in the NYX
butter gloss and eclair I would be happy
to send it to one of you you're going to
put a comment down below in the comments
that you are interested in the NYX
butter gloss and 24 hours ish after this
video is uploaded I will pick a winner i
will put the name of the winner in the
comments i will contact them through
YouTube mail I will put a comment
underneath their comment to try to
notify the winner I will warn you though
i am terrible at sending things out
quickly so i don't know when you will
get it but you will get it i just sent
out a huge batch of stuff and there were
some people they were waiting for like
well over a month i know it's terrible
i'm a terrible person they should all
have their stuff at this point so if
you've want to give away on my channel
and you have not received your stuff at
this point please please please send me
a miss a message and let me know what I
missed because and the school year was
insane anyway that's off topic so
somebody will win the next butter gloss
which is one of my favorite formulas of
all time of lip glosses okay next I got
the Carol's Daughter sacred tiara
anti-breakage anti-frizz styling cream
Carol's Daughter I've really enjoyed the
products i think i've tried two products
from them i've enjoyed both of them so
very excited to try that as well proven
to instantly stop shedding and frizz
shedding you know what's funny I've
never thought of myself as being someone
who sheds you know I think of that as
dogs so I if I own Carol's Daughter I
don't know if i would put shedding you
know maybe uh you know keeps your hair
in your head i don't know i don't think
i would put shedding I think that's a
really weird thing to say to a human I'm
excited to try that none the
and then oh gosh all right last thing is
a real tree for her it looks like a
perfume everyone else loved their empty
bag this month i am not feeling it I'm
not feeling it well unless this is
amazing because I do love perfume um hmm
it's very floral does it have notes in
here for this no of course not you know
what the biggest complaint i have about
FC as they don't include any information
about the products it would be really
nice if i didn't have to go all the way
to the Ipsy website to find out
information about it you know what we're
just going to do that right now because
i want to know what the notes are for
this and I want to find out so I'll be
right back you see that the bottle is
actually really pretty for the full size
that's really cool the 3.4 ounce 100
milliliter bottle is twenty dollars and
it says real treat for her opens up with
a sweet taste of pomegranate which I
don't relate with my small pomegranate
in there yeah I guess so maybe a little
bit a hands of par semaine persimmon
move an exotic stint of orchids that I
smell it blends with lotus blossom and
Shemp champaca flower and it's flowered
followed by the rich son of amber the
transient scent of violets and the depth
of mahogany wood yeah I'm not a fan of
the sense I prefer if you're going to go
floral I need it to be balanced with a
little more fruit for me to be happy
it's just too much flour is a little
grandma efore me and just I don't know
it just it sometime just not a fan I'm
not a fan so overall epsy for me was a
big want wah unfortunately I got the
broken brow pencil I got the way too
young for me eyeliner I got the
duplicate of an amazing product but
still a duplicate of the NYX butter
gloss not their fault but still I
already have it I got the pretty kind of
excited Carol's Daughter styling cream
and the not excited at all about the
real tree perfumes so didn't get the
Jesse scroll eyeliner which I'm very
very sad about that was what I really
wanted I also heard there's a chocolate
Soleil bronzer out there
which I'm sure not too many people got
you know it is what it is not every
month can be amazing and for me if see
this month was not amazing at all so I
would love to know what you all got in
your epsy bags leave a comment down
below I would love to know what your
favorite product was what some busts
were for you things you did like didn't
like about yours and what you thought in
mind if you'd like and yeah thank you so
