with you though
hello my friends welcome to my review of
my februari epsy bag and my unpacking
ish thing of the march FC bag instead of
doing a traditional on bagging where I
just show you what I got kind of hall
style I like to do a review of the
previous previous month's bag so you can
know what I think about it so that you
know whether ypsi maybe a subscription
for you or maybe some of the products in
here maybe something you might want to
go out and purchase so that's the way I
like to do what if C is a ten dollar a
month subscription bag that gets sent to
your door I pay for it out right I'm not
sponsored by ypsi this is all just like
anybody else they don't you know send me
anything special let me go ahead and go
into the februari bag first thing I want
to show you is the trust fund beauty
nail polish really like this nail polish
a lot I like the brush on this it's kind
of a bigger brush and it flattens out
onto the nail which I really really like
this was a to coat polish which is what
I look for in a nail polish i really
like 12 to coat and oh I forgot to tell
you this is in the shade I'm kind of a
big deal lasting her on this was pretty
typical for me like a two to three-day
lasting time on this and it's it's a
very nice polish is it amazing no but
it's definitely nice and I'm really
really thankful to have it I enjoy it
another product that I really really
enjoyed with the naked cosmedix mica
pigment this says number s n0 2 it says
Sierra Nevada on the back but someone
told me that that's not the shade that
that's something else I don't know but
my only critique about this is the
packaging the packaging is extremely
messy it just gets all over the place I
don't know why companies insist on
messing with what works when it comes to
loose pigment shadows I mean you put
like bare minerals you put the filter in
the top you screw on the top it works
great I don't know why they insist on
getting creative on this I guess the
packaging is cute but if it's going to
make a mess it's not worth of having the
fancy packaging the application and
where time of this shadow is wonderful
it is absolutely gorgeous it is really
pretty I've enjoyed it from day one I've
worn it probably five or six times since
I've gotten it and have really really
liked it it's really nice for that pop
of bright shimmer in the middle of your
eye it's just a really really nice
product highly recommend this I just
wish that they would change their
packaging the next product that i really
liked is by company called more
mor and this is the hand and body lotion
in Candide vanillin it says that its
enriched with almond extract and argan
oil I tend to like more products overall
a friend of mine back in the very very
beginning of my channel her name's
Bonnie Morales she doesn't make videos
anymore but she had sent me one of their
body butters and I really enjoyed and
ever since then every time I see more
I'm like oh yeah that's a good brand and
I did enjoy this its moist erised my
hands very nicely I really personally
enjoy the scent of vanilla so I really
liked it a lot as far as the scent and
it seeps into the hands very nicely it's
a typical really nice hand lotion and
I'm very thankful to have it now the
products that I did not like but I
really think both of them are due to
personal preference this is the Smashbox
photo finish primer wheel if you like
that oily feeling on your skin if you
like to wait whale moisturize your skin
if you're one of those people that just
does that you'll probably really like
this it did extend the aware of my
makeup I just personally don't like the
feeling of oil on my skin it takes a lot
for me to be able to handle that like I
don't like face max and like anything
that slimy and anyway on my face I don't
like spraying things on my face I like
lotion is as far as I go like
moisturizer I can do moisturizer but
Wales is a little much for me so I think
that's just me that I didn't like it I
don't think that it's a bad product i
think it's just me it's not you oil it's
me I'm breaking up with you though
another one that I'm breaking up with is
the jor-el Parker oh so de verano de
parfum this one was very floral for me
it's very girly very daytime very fresh
and light and it's just not sweet enough
for me it's too bouquet of flowers for
me it just wasn't me lasting power on
this also was pretty good lasted about
four hours before the scent kind of
dissipated so much that I couldn't I had
to go like this to smell it but I mean
it's not a bad perfume it's just it
doesn't match me so I'm breaking up with
you too sorry but overall I mean for ten
bucks I think this definitely is a win
bad for me I've got these three products
that i think are well over worth ten
dollars the mineral eyeshadow the nail
polish and the hand lotion total wins
for me and then for the perfume and we
all that's just personal preference i
did not like these but the three
products i will definitely say this was
worth well over 10
dollars Thank You FC well done and then
let's show you what I got in march i
will be reviewing these met next month
i'm going to fly in the subscribe button
right there so that you can make sure
you click that if you were on a laptop
or desktop so you don't forget to watch
my video next month and also if you're
on mobile at the subscribe buttons down
below so let's show you what I got not
as excited about this one as i was about
the februari one this is probably the
most exciting product in here for me
this is the mellow bronze face blush and
this is just a nice tone for my skin
tone and i'm looking forward to using
this more i think that's going to give a
nice glow to the cheeks and i'm excited
about that i do already own it the NYX
liquid suede in the shade soft spoken
I've worn it many many times I have it
right here so this one I will be passing
along but i'll give you a full review on
how i feel about this product i got some
some opinions on this one I'll share
with you next month this is a brush by
an eyebrow brush they say bye Bo gosh
sheets is the way that I say it but I
know that that's wrong and I apologize
I'm not I don't speak French so it's
really hard for me to say French words
without extensive looking up and I tried
to look this one up and I can't find it
so anyway so this brush is very very
thin for an eyebrow brush so this is
going to take a lot of work to get into
my caterpillars and really fill in those
brows so i would actually think about
using this for eyeliner rather than
browse i need something a little thicker
for my brow so i'm probably to use it
for both and i'll let Janelle and then
the last thing oh no there's two more
things the next thing is another thing
i'm considering not opening this is just
the star looks jet luxe long where I
pencil I tried tons of these I have a
bunch of black eye pencils and I don't
want to waste this so I'm probably just
going to review this as I've reviewed
many star looks I pencils and kind of
give you my idea of what I think about
those and try some my other store looks
pencils because I would hate to open
this use it once or twice and then not
use it again so I'm going to keep this
brand new I think and I just review the
other store looks pencils that I had for
next month I hate to do that but I hate
to waste to it's one of those things
catch-22 you know the last thing I got
in here with the organic surge daily
care comforting hand and nail cream in
lavender
meadow and this I have not used yet the
scent is a little bit lavender II but
it's also got a sweetness to it which is
very very nice and that's kind of what I
look for my floral scented products is a
little bit of a softness a little bit of
a frosting smell to go along with it and
I know that sounds a little weird but
smells very very nice it's got kind of a
like a whipped cream kind of smell along
with the flowers so we'll see how that
goes but I'm excited to try this so I
don't know I said so a lot of times I
don't really know how I'm going to feel
about this stuff once I try it I feeling
I'm not gonna like it as much as I like
my februari bag but we'll see I mean
once I get into these products more
maybe I'll love them so we'll see I want
