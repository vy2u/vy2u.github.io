hip seat bag for the month I just
seriously overbooked myself for this
month and I just I had too many videos
to shoot and too many of them were box
opening so I just pushed my box openings
all the way to the end of the month so
finally made its empty I've been looking
at this thing and lugging on this thing
just wondering what's inside of avoiding
the Ipsy website because they tell you
now like if you don't want to know
what's in your bag don't go on the impsy
website until after you've opened it
once they've mailed it because it will
pop up and it will tell you what's in
your bag I learned that last month so I
saw it real quick and I turned it off
real quick and made sure I know so it so
anyway I wanted to show you what I got
for my extra this month so excited thank
you all so much to everyone who's been
using my Ipsy link I got the marvelous
Moxie by bare minerals lipstick and
light it up thanks to you all and used
my Ipsy referral points so thank you for
that and there's something coming out of
there it is directions for lipstick
strange okay
sure there's this little button here and
let's how'd you open what you need to do
Open Sesame
oh I see it which slides here so maybe
slide uh-huh
okay and this is like the Great Crazy
Legs big packaging I don't know that's
crazy there's a little slide thing where
you slide it and then it pops out okay
sure looks very pretty looks like it's
it's not real like it doesn't even look
real it's such a beautiful shape nice
let's see we got going on pretty I will
totally rock that the spring here is the
bag I'm sure you have seen this before
mine doesn't smell bad I saw another
hypsi opening they said their bag smell
bag my bag lads month smell bad this one
doesn't smell bad and it's like a canvas
II kind of texture and then the card and
the Ipsy cards are pretty useless they
don't really give you much information
just kind of like updates on their site
and the brands are down below that they
use this month okay so first thing I
pull
is the Hank 1050 classic sport natural
sudden screening and of course we can
always use sunscreen sunscreen is an
essential in the summer and it feels
like it's completely full this is a one
fluid ounce tube so this will last a
little while very excited about this
depending on where I use it I guess I
guess I might use it all over my body so
I gonna last that long but just for my
face it will definitely last a long time
this is balanced guru balanced guru okay
I've only ever gotten one product for
balanced guru and I've gotten it twice
and it was like a oily stuff I think it
was like a moisturizer or something I
forgot and that really weird smell but
yeah this is a no frizz oil so I mean
anxious to try something different from
this company totally tried to redo my
nail before I shot this video totally
just messed it up I should have put some
Pam on it
don't hold it against me on my nails
looks like dude oh here we go this is
the balance guru no frizz oil I wonder
what the basis of this what's in this
stuff glycerin so Jaa soybean oil starts
with soybean oil goes to sesame seed oil
then olive oil castor oil argan oil
grapeseed oil lots of different kinds of
oil there's some jojoba oil in here some
pumpkin seed oil some other kind of nut
oil some sunflower seed oil basically
let's see okay so I guess balance guru
was like okay let's see how many kind of
oils they make it let's just mix them
all together and put them and make it a
serum so let's see what happens with
this it has a very make sure I don't
drip it on myself
it has like a very citrusy set it's got
a really nice smell for a hair oil
sometimes they smell a little funky
alright let's see what's next enough
about that
alright the pur Lisse pur moist hydra
balance moisturizer i think we got a
full-size of this in a boxy charm and
this one i can see because of my
lighting is filled to here it is 0.5
ounce it is a really really nice
moisturizer i have used it and it is
fantastic so always happy to have a
little bit more of that and it's really
expensive I think full-size is like 50
bucks or something alright this is a hey
honey
take it off where do they come up with
this stuff I think they think they like
okay let's just get an inappropriate
possible without crossing the line hey
honey take it off exfoliating honey
peel-off mask for all skin types is this
telling me that it's gonna take my face
off because that does not sound
appealing you take my face off I happen
to like my face it's not perfect but I
do like it and I really don't want to
take it off it says for directions of
use go - hey honey calm so if you don't
have internet access you're totally
screwed hopefully it doesn't really take
your face off all right and then the
last thing that's in here I believe it's
the last thing let me see other than
silica gel is the Pacifica eyeshadow duo
and I think everybody got some variation
of this this month let's see which one I
got it didn't look too impressive in the
ones that I saw I got the purple and
white all right oh it's not white show
you okay so those are the finger
swatches and swatches those are actually
nice I think those are workable I like
those this one's probably gonna need a
little build up but those are nice not
super duper uber pigmented but doesn't
have to be to be good sometimes it's
nice for shadow not to be super
pigmented at first and then to be able
to be built up let me see if I can build
it up a bit because they're definitely I
mean I don't know the the one on the
right is definitely pretty powdery the
one will last a little bit creamier let
me say I don't know they might be
workable we'll have to play with them
and see definitely gonna create a more
natural look you're not gonna get a lot
of bold pop there with that
so that was my Ipsy bag for this month
overall pretty happy with it I got this
as a bonus so this didn't come in the
bags but really happy about that I think
that's what I'm most excited about but
didn't go in the bag sunscreen you know
I mean sunscreen is very useful I will
use it but I can't say it's exciting to
me the hair oil I'm excited to try and
see what all of these oils do when you
just mix them up and shake them in a
bottle and then the hey honey
exfoliating mask I will be reading these
directions because it says it's gonna
take my face off so I'll be reading the
directions before I try that one the pur
Lisse always happy to have a little bit
more of that this is a great moisturizer
and the eyeshadow depends on how it
works it works great it's gonna be great
if it does if it's terrible and I'm not
excited about it but I mean not super
impressive off the bat especially with
the
kind of baby shimmery looking one so we
