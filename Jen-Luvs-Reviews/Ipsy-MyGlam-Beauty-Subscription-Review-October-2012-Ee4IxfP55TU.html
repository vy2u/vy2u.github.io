excited to get my glam bag because our
EPS bag huh bye-bye it's too bad my hips
abag I was excited because I saw on the
sea website what the bag look like and
isn't this so stinking cute I absolutely
love this little bag I am in love with
it I don't know what it is about this
it's just so attractive to me I just
love this and I cannot wait to UM use
this to for my collection it seems to be
continually growing okay so here's our
theme this month which is called hello
bombshell October offers are the bomb
and as soon as I turned it around I saw
there was something from the bomb in
this box and bag in this bag and I was
so excited about that because I love my
stuff that I've gotten from the bomb so
super excited to see that okay so i'll
talk about that first the first thing we
got was what's your type blast mess
matte black mascara on the body builder
from the bomb overall I like this
mascara I it doesn't clump it lengthens
and volumizes is not um the most amazing
mascara I have ever tried I'm not like
oh my gosh I have to repurchase this um
but i may buy this again it wasn't bad
it wasn't it didn't blow my mind um so
yeah if you're looking for a good
mascara you happen to be buying stuff
from the bomb i would recommend this the
next thing that we got was this lip balm
and it is a bomb what I put that on my
lips oh no oh this one let's go on my
lips this is gonna go to my friend hi
ken is gonna get this a glorious
mirrorless lip balm because there is no
way on God's green earth and I'm going
to put this lip gloss on my lips when it
is not Halloween this thing is insane it
is really cheap action no time it's
adorable packaging i love it i love
packaging oh not
okay I did see that someone got a
brownish one of these and I thought that
looked really cute the red one I
wouldn't know Warren cuz I saw some
people got red but this one the the pink
one is not next up we got this heck we
or PB oil treatment which restores
softness and shine by color Couture and
there's that and it is a lot like um
it's got this little snap top okay it's
got the little snap top and you flip
that open and then you drop it little
drops it reminds me a lot of argan oil
as far as the consistency of it um it's
oily it smells very nice it smells very
buttery and it says you're supposed to
work a small amount evenly into your
hair before you blow dry or air dry for
a silky shiny hair or after you style to
calm frizziness and fly aways or any
time for added softness and I did use
this I did like it um it didn't blow my
mind so I don't think I'll be buying
this for the full price but I will enjoy
it while I have it let's talk about this
cute little eye shadow that we got from
coastal said look out a sub cute it's so
adorable and I actually put all my eyes
today because I want to check the
staying power of it I did put primer on
my eyes I used on Urban Decay's primer
potion I forget which one but anyway I
just everybody catch crying potion and
you can see I put this makeup on at
about seven-thirty this morning and it
is now nine-thirty you can see it's
still on there no creasing um it does
definitely doesn't look as beautiful as
it did when I first put it on um what I
did was I put the light color which is
called vanilla sky all over my lid then
i use the vibrant red on the outer half
outer third and then i use the frosty
taupe in the crease and then i use the
raisin berry to just kind of dark in
that outer corner it did kind of look
like my eyes were bleeding
for a minute so I had to take some brown
i use Muse from my vice palette and I
had to cut a dark in the outer corner I
also use the black from I don't know
what it's called that's in my new tube
palette because I just happened to have
that in my hand for whatever random
reason to jerking off the outer corner
of course you can't really see that now
because I did it however many hours ago
but overall is staying power was pretty
good of these I do have some quote I do
have a postal sense palette that I got
oh gosh 2007 I got this Coastal Scents
palette when I first started watching
makeup geek TV um forever ago and she
recommended the Coastal Scents out so I
think at that so I do overall enjoy
Coastal Scents palettes I don't think
I'll be buying any more any time soon
just because I had a ridiculous amount
of Coastal Scents I shadows and you know
I'm cool on those okay the last thing we
got in here was a marker eyeliner it's
just um I guess I see a bombshells the
name of the company and its their
eyeliner staying power is pretty good
better than the off one which it should
be for that I'm sure it costs more than
the elf one um it is like drawing on
your eye with a sharpie it really is it
doesn't have a nice crisp line um it's
fine I wouldn't be I wouldn't recommend
it to be purchased um unless you really
like a marker eyeliner I think a sharp
you would work just as good um overall
my favorite thing in this bag was the
bag itself my second favorite thing in
the bag was probably the mascara I
followed closely by the eyeshadow um the
things I did not like as much were the
eyeliner the definitely the lip gloss
lip balm I should call it cuz that's
what it's called and the hair oil
treatment um which just didn't seem to
do anything fabulous for me maybe
because i use argan oil i'm kind of
spoiled by it but I mean I definitely
was calm
moles of the effects of the argan oil so
if you're looking for an alternative to
argan oil that the peak oil might be
something that you might be looking into
