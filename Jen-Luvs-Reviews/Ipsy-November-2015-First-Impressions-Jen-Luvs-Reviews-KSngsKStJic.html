of my Ipsy bag from November I've
actually already opened this but I did
want to show you what I got in my Ipsy
bag this is one of my most highly
requested videos that I haven't made in
forever is just showing you guys what I
got in my glam bag now this is what I'm
going to be doing subscription bags from
now on I'm going to be kind of showing
you what I got and then the next month
I'll be giving you a review on the
products that are in this bag now I have
had this bag for a good week or two so I
can give you some little mini reviews on
some of the things I just haven't tried
everything yet but this way I don't
procrastinate
on showing you what I got because I
haven't tried everything but then I
never review it because then it's too
late and blah blah blah all that so
we're just going to show you what I got
the first thing I got is the stove X
extra deep hair cream and I've gotten
essence subscription boxes quite a few
times so I have tried this product
before it is a wonderful wonderful deep
conditioning mask I really really like
it a lot it says Brazilian keratin
protect and repair and I have enjoyed
this in the past I used to have these
really weird directions on it like
something like you had to wear some kind
of salon cap or you had to put it under
some kind of like salon heat and order
for it to work those directions are no
longer on here so I don't know if
they've changed the formula or if it's
just they just took it off because they
know that that's too high maintenance
for a typical person like who in the
world has oh it said salon vaporizer who
in the world has a salon vaporizer in
their house like oh yeah I'm just gonna
go use my salon vaporizer
you know nobody does that so I think
they took that off there they probably
took it off because it worked fine
without it but it probably works better
if you use it on the salon so that's
probably why I was on there but anyway
point is good product use it before I
haven't used this one yet the other
thing is is this is a huge huge sample
of this so I was really thankful tips
included such a big sample of it the
next thing I got was this liquid
gossamer by jelly pom-pom cosmetics I
did use this once I want to use it a
little bit more it was very weird to
blend in didn't really blend in
my skin too well oh oh too much too much
Jen too much ah
get back in there I tell you all right
but it just kind of sat on the top of my
skin and didn't really blend in very
nicely um it's just it's kind of an
obnoxious shine in that it doesn't like
I'm wearing champagne pop today
champagne pop kind of blends into the
skin so it kind of you know it gives you
kind of a natural glow you know I mean
because nobody really looks like this
but this just looks like you've got some
painted shimmer on your face you know so
I haven't really been enjoying this so
far I do want to use it some more maybe
use it with some different setting
powders and things and see if that helps
but so far I'm not a fan of this when I
am a fan of is this inspir eyes shadow I
did where that says in all of her shadow
color one day with primer and I really
really enjoyed it it's a very nice
shadow I used it on the weekend when I
was like just trying to get out of the
house with a quick look it doesn't show
up very pigmented on my hand now that
i'm swatching it but on the eye actually
looks very very nice do a double swatch
I feel like it's not doing it justice in
the swatch but I am really enjoying this
it is in the shade carnival and yeah
it's it's a really nice shadow lasted
all day long it's great the next thing
that we got with this Tris TKE mini
matte lip crayon now I am wearing the
Tati lip crayon right now it looks kind
of similar to that it is even let's see
it's a little bit smaller in size than
the toffee ones but I have not tried
this yet so this is something that I'm
gonna have to try and get back to you on
it does have kind of a good cherry
plastic kind of smell so we'll have to
see whether that affects me or not like
whether it stays on the lips because I
don't like stinky smells on my lip so
we'll say but I did I have tried some
other products from for speak that I
really loved I am using I used today the
Tris teak eyebrow crayon and I really
really like that product a lot so I'm
rooting for this product to be good
alright the last product that I got in
my Ipsy bag in November was these
Smashbox full exposure mascara now this
is a product that I have used before and
have really
really really liked my biggest critique
about this mascara is this ginormous
brush and I put this up to my eye look
it takes up my entire eye and I do not
have small eyes I have pretty big eyes
and it takes up my whole I like I can't
even a matte like more than my whole
what I really I mean look at that that's
craziness so it's just gigantic so if
you have a small eye this may be really
difficult to work with but it really if
you can get it to work it really does
work nicely and I would recommend it if
you feel like you can work with that
size of a brush now I haven't used this
particular sample yet but I am adding it
to my mascara drawer to try to make sure
that I'm still loving it it has been a
few months since I have tried one so I
want to make sure that I'm still loving
it before I fully review it that is it
for my empty bag for November so to
recap I got the big sample of the
Novack's hair mask I got the deluxe
sample of the Tris tika lipstick I got
the inspiration oh and I got the
Smashbox mascara deluxe sample and the
deluxe sample I think it's a little
sample of the liquid gossamer
highlighter so for now I feel like this
is a pretty good epsy bag of him I think
that between these three products these
I think are worth 10 dollars to me if I
saw these in a bag for ten dollars I
would get them I feel like just these
two alone are worth ten dollars to me
because I really like these so we'll see
as I try the products more whether I
changed my mind or I keep the same idea
so we'll come back mid to late December
