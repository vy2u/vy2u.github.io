the June ape sea bag and my unboxing ish
thing of the July if sea bag you may
know I was on vacation for the last
month so I've actually had quite a long
time to try the products in the June bag
and I've actually already tried
everything in July but I'm gonna try to
save my reviews of the July stuff until
I get my August bag but I will tell you
what I thought of everything on my June
bag first and I'll show you what I got
in July so the fireball is what I'm
gonna talk about first by Urban Decay
this is an eyeshadow and when you look
at it you're like oh my gosh it's so big
oh my gosh you're such a good size and
then you open it up and it's like oh
it's just a little baby but that's okay
because it's amazing and and this will
take me a while to go through I use this
quite a bit when I was on my road trip
and I really like this a lot it lives up
to urban to take urban decay quality
it's exactly what I need it to be
it's very shimmery it's got the nice
duochrome in it it doesn't crease on me
I definitely last longer with a primer
but man is this a beautiful shadow
really really really happy with this
definitely excited to have that in here
the next thing in here is a product that
didn't work so great form even though I
love the brand this is a brand Marc
Anthony i religiously use their shampoo
and conditioners I use only those I
contribute not contribute but I
attribute the lasting power of my crazy
color to using that shampoo it's
actually faded a bit because I switched
shampoos and I don't know what I was
thinking and I switched I was trying out
a product and it totally started
stripping the color out of my hair but
when I only use Marc Anthony shampoo and
conditioner my hair color less forever
this product however the beach spray did
not work super well for me and I think
it's because either I'm just not a hair
person I just don't know how to use this
or my hair is too thin it just you know
it ended up just making my hair look
stringy but I really think it might be
operator error I don't know or just is
my hair but this just didn't personally
work for me I can see that it might work
for other people it just didn't work for
me another
product that didn't work for me was the
Seraphine botanicals blush this has
beautiful pigmentation when it goes on
but it blends out really really easily
to the point where you can't even see it
anymore and it's very disappointing
because it's a gorgeous color I was
really sad that it didn't last and even
whatever color I could manage to keep on
my cheeks does not last a long time so I
was really sad about this and again
maybe it's my skin type I don't know but
it did not last on me and now this
product I honestly I have to tell you I
did not get a chance to try this this is
the formula X nail polish and the shade
wingwoman on my vacation I couldn't
paint my nails at all because it's just
too hard to maintain on the road you
know camping and all of that so I didn't
try wingwoman overall I typically really
like formula X nail polishes I've had
some misses in like their neon line but
this is not part of that line that I
know of but other than that I've really
had great a great experience with
formula X nail polishes I'm actually
wearing a formula X nail polish right
now I've been wearing it for three days
and I have no chips like overall I
really like this Brad's but I can't
speak to this one and then the last
product is a product I can speak to that
I can tell you that I did not like this
is the japonesque solid brush cleanser
gentle goat-milk cleansing balm I just
this one just isn't effective for what I
need and the kind of products that I use
it just doesn't clean my brushes well
enough so this was a no for me
so overall with this I honestly don't
think that this bag was worth ten
dollars I did not like this I did not
like this little mini nail polish and
this I don't feel like is worth ten
dollars to me it's getting close I would
pay eight dollars for these two but
definitely not ten so unfortunately this
was not a good epsy bag for me but I
think some of it was personal preference
oh and then this didn't work for me so
yeah it's a big want womp for June for
me unfortunately but I do really like
this a lot I'm very happy to have it
very happy so you know I'm thankful that
I have it but I don't think the bag was
worth ten dollars to me I did like this
little bag I think this is super cute so
let me show you what I got in July I got
this cute little bag
and I think it's adorable it's got a
little beach umbrellas I almost thought
it was like little mints but they're
supposed to be a little beach umbrellas
it's very cute and I like the
holographic effect on it's very pretty I
was really excited to see this brush
this is by luck see I love luck see
brushes they are super fab this is a
small angle brush really really love
this brand of brushes another brand that
I really really like a lot is J cat
Beauty I've gotten a bunch of stuff PR
from them and I really like them as a
brand so I'll be reviewing the eyebrow
pencil next month and then the organic
Serge daily care revitalizing eye
revitalizing reviving can I speak today
reviving eye gel and this is our gel so
I want to use this more I haven't used
it a whole lot this I have used quite a
bit the pure correcting primer I'm
excited to tell you about this one this
is the fun one and then the last thing
in here is one just hands-down I can
tell you right now this is this huge win
for me the meet matrimony and this is in
the shade Matt Moskowitz I'm wearing it
on the outer corner of my eye today just
stellar product from the balm just
stellar I have to tell you so I have a
feeling could tell you that this is
probably going to beat out the Jun bag
really like a lot of these products in
here but I will do the full review next
month so thank you so much for watching
