to review bags and an Ipsy bag unpacking
hello my friends welcome to my FC bag
reviews and unpacking for july august
and sep tember hope you're having a good
September almost october already this
video is all about if see an Ipsy is a
ten dollar a month subscription service
and you get lots of makeup hair skin
care beauty goodies in your epsy bag you
don't know what you're gonna get and you
get what you get you don't get upset you
can tell well you can get upset but you
can't return anything you get your ten
dollars stuff in the bag and it's like a
lottery and that's why I think so many
people are addicted to subscription
boxes and bags is because it's almost
like gambling but with beauty items you
know I almost imagine like a giant claw
going down but you can't see what the
claw is gonna grab and then you open it
up and you get this bag and it's like oh
so it's kind of fun and I think that's
the addiction of subscription boxes and
bags so I do subscribe to ypsi I've been
subscribed epsy forever and the way that
I do these reviews is that I try the
products for an entire month in this
case two months and then I also show you
what we reviewed next month what I got
in my September bag alright let's just
get into what I got the bag is really
cute it's got little beach umbrellas on
there I thought that it was like little
mint candies at first then I was like
what are they sending me this is more of
a December bag but I got it once i look
down as I God it kind of looks you know
like a shimmering very shimmery
iridescent beach there and I'll show you
my favorite product I got in here first
this is the meat matrimony matte
eyeshadow palette single and this is in
the shade Matt Moskowitz Wow is this an
amazing shade i actually just ordered
the full meet matrimony palette because
i loved this so much i got it on
hautelook they just had the balm on
there and oh my goodness so excited so
excited about this use this a handful of
times and the pigmentations amazing
lasting powers amazing cannot wait to
get the full palette next up oh the pure
correcting primer I really like this
primer I haven't tried a whole lot from
pure minerals but I was really excited
to try this and I really liked it a lot
when you put it on it has
as a peach tone but then it blends in so
if you have a deeper skin tone it's
going to look more lotion e on you it's
got like a lotion II kind of feel to it
I'm not sure what the ingredients are in
this but it doesn't feel silicone e it
feels more lotion e which I've seen more
people liking lately than the silicone
base the more lotion e feeling ones I
just thought was a really nice way to
get my makeup started you know and I
don't know if an extended wear time it
definitely gave an illuminating effect I
tried it with a matte foundation and it
made the mat not so flat which I thought
was really cool but did try it with an
illuminating foundation as well and I
didn't feel like it fully pushed it over
the top it's not like um it's shiny but
it's not sparkly there's no glitter in
here I think it's the burberry one that
has glitter in it and it's just like are
you kidding me but this one just kind of
gives a nice subtle shine to it and I
like the way it looks I like the way
foundation looks over top of it so it
was definitely a big win for me next
thing in here is the organic starts
daily care reviving I gel and this is a
gel it feels like a gel it looks like a
gel it actually feels kind of watery
when you put it on I used it for an
entire month I didn't see many effects
of it I didn't really see any effects of
it so I put it to the side and I started
using other eye products maybe with
extended wear extended use it would work
better but unfortunately it wasn't
enough of amazingness for me to use it
long term to purchase a full size I'll
probably end up using this up eventually
but I won't think I'll purchase a full
size of that and then next is the jcat
beauty perfect duo brow pencil and I
really liked this brow pencil the shade
was a little off for me it was a little
bit light for me so I didn't use it a
whole lot but when I did I thought it
was really nice I just wish that I had
gotten a little bit darker of a shade
Jake a beauty is a very inexpensive
brand I've tried a lot of their products
they sent me products for review once
and I like most of the products that
I've tried from them and the brow
product was very nice I don't like it as
much as the Anasazi brow Wiz on my
loreal brow definer but it's you know
it's nice it's not bad it's just nice
you're not good you're not bad you're
just nice sorry I think I've told that
joke before but I had to go in it I had
to go there again
right next thing is the Lexi's small
angle brush this is a really nice brush
I'm a huge fan of luck see brushes and
this one is fantastic it so it's good
for eyeliner and it's good for brows
it's good for both and the reason why I
really like it is that the the brushes
are very stiff when I want to put on
eyeliner I don't want it flippin and
floppin and bending all over the place
saying with brow products and this brush
is perfect it's perfect and it's very
very thin so if you have want a very
thin line or if you have their want to
do very thin eyebrows are very detailed
eyebrow work this brush is perfect and
this is the 215 small angle brush super
Fab so do I feel like this is worth ten
bucks absolutely absolutely and the
reason why mostly the brush the brush
itself is amazing i love the eyeshadow
that kind of pushes it over the edge
really like the face primer so those
three products are definitely worth over
ten dollars to me he's like a kind of
nin they're not bad but they're not
great so yes definite win on the july
bag let's move on to August alright the
August bag was super super cute very
Michelle Phan I think she did the art on
this I mean it's just so stinking cute
she's got this little crown of make up
here and it's just it's stinkin adorable
I love the shape of it to just I can't
believe like I would pay five dollars
six dollars at least for this bag alone
maybe even more i love this bag was
probably my favorite bag of ever gotten
and that says a luxe I've been getting
Ipsy bag since pretty much the beginning
all right first thing in here is a very
strange product this is the Peter
lamothe think llama supreme radiant
complexion booster for all skin types
wait to see this stuff this stuff is
weird all right I know I have old
swatches on my hand I apologize for that
I just filmed if you want to know how I
got this I looked and why my eyes look
crazy today I just did a review of the
extravagant I set from Sephora and
that's what I have on my eyes today and
I tried to wash my hand and it won't
come off I didn't go as far as using
makeup remover I probably shut out but
but yet but if you want to know about
all this stuff then i will put the link
down below and there's also a little I
next to my head if you click the screen
if you don't see it click the screen
it'll be there
and it'll take you to that video so
anyway this product is weird look see
how it's brown so then what you do is
you just rub it in like this and it
leaves on the face I guess I can't
really see it on my hand but it leaves a
little bit of brown tone on my skin my
hand is slightly darker than my face so
I don't see it and maybe because i had
primer there to let me put on the other
hand and see if it makes a difference
but when i put this on my face I could
definitely see it changing to a little
bit Tanner of a skin tone it would left
it looking hydrated and browner I don't
see it on my hand which makes me think
that maybe it's just that my skin tone
is really light on my face compared to
my hand I don't know but I'm surprised
that it blended right into my hand it
feels very silky and smooth to go on
it's probably got silicone in it I would
imagine yeah silicones the first
ingredient followed by another silicones
well it just feels really good on the
skin it says that it even skin tone
smooth wrinkles eliminate the complexion
and his ultra sheer I did find the brown
tone on my skin I don't know if anybody
else found that which it was kind of
weird I do feel like it even my skin
tone I do feel like it eliminated the
complexion I don't feel like it smooth
wrinkles so I don't think I'm gonna be
buying a full-size this because I don't
think I needed in my life but I'll
definitely use the rest of this one nail
polish by ciate London this is their
paint pot in the shade dangerous affair
I actually really like this for se hace
Paul ciancia polishes are very hit and
miss for me mostly miss a lot of times
they'd ship within one 1 two 2 days this
one lasted three to four days which is
relatively typical for a more expensive
polish for me it's not amazing but it
was good I've got about 100 nail
polishes let's see one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
I've got about 11 nail polishes that are
so much i'm looking at my nail polish
rack up there and it's just I don't need
this color so i can't say i was
personally excited about it i can see
why other people might be excited about
it but I wasn't excited next one the it
cosmetics no tub waterproof gel eyeliner
this is probably one my least favorite
products from it cosmetics I love that
cosmetics but I do not like this
eyeliner it runs down my eyes on me so i
end up with raccoon eyes
for a higher-end eyeliner to me that's
not acceptable I don't like that at all
it makes me very unhappy so this was a
no for me one product that I don't have
anymore because i accidentally forgot to
keep the packaging was a face mask that
we got i'll put a picture of it here it
was very wet it was very slimy I don't
like face masks I suffer through just to
make sure there's nothing magical about
it but I really should just pass them on
and just not try them at all because I
always feel guilty using them and then I
don't like them so I can't honestly for
someone that loved masks don't listen to
me i can't really review it because i
don't really like anything's mask I
think I've maybe liked one or two face
masks in my entire life of all of these
face masks I've tried so I don't take a
personal but you know I didn't like it
because it's just me with face masks the
last product in here was probably the
only thing in here that I really truly
enjoyed and that's the winky looks
diamond powder I used this as an
under-eye setting powder and I really
really liked it a lot I was expecting it
because it's called a diamond powder I
was expecting it to be Diamond D and
sparkly and it didn't have any sparkler
shine which was fine with me because it
made a very nice setting powder this one
is in the shade light I'm hoping that
they sent out different skin tones I
don't know if they did but this one was
very nice for me from brightening my
under eyes so it made me very very happy
I was very happy to have this so do i
feel like the August bag was worth ten
dollars and the answer is absolutely not
I don't think it was worth ten dollars
for me this was definitely not worth it
I didn't know and this I could do
without this I don't like the mask I
didn't like the only thing that I
actually enjoyed was the winky luxe
powder and this is definitely not worth
ten dollars to me so that was a big on
the August back but let's go ahead and
let me show you what I got in September
that i'll be reviewing next month we
have thee mm-hmm the ba boom is a shade
by be a bombshell cosmetics nail polish
I've tried so many be a bombshell
products I like a lot of their product
so I'm curious to try their nail polish
it's this deep deep blue definitely
going to try this very excited about
that I'm also very very excited about
the buff her house of exfoliation it
just sounds in
robbery it's called the crumbles vanilla
almond foaming food facial scrub I have
not even opened this yet probably open
it and smell it at least because it
looks amazing doesn't smell like
anything how can you call someone
something vanilla almond and then have
it not smell like anything really I'm so
disappointed why why the number one
ingredient is rice and then sugar and
then almond oil vanilla bean seeds this
is I feel like this really less excited
now less excited now mm-hmm all right
this one I've actually tried i'm not
going to review it till next month but I
want to warn you if you did get this
please be careful if you don't like pain
on your lips this is the two-faced lip
injection extreme and it is quite
extreme if you want to see me actually
use this you can kind of fast forward
through my weekly chat that I do every
week with the community on the YouTube
channel it's called an anti hall but
this was one of the products that I
talked about anything in the ads I hall
and I put it on and I talked about the
experience of using it so feel free to
pop over there if you want to see that
in action next thing is the of Renee I
never know how to say this avene a
hydrants up to Mel and this is I guess
it's a moisturizer it's a serum but I
don't know what it does or anything i'll
have to look this up one thing i don't
like about FC is they don't include a
card with products on it and that is
just very difficult because then i have
to go to the website and i gotta look it
up and it's just a pain in the butt so
i'll look this up it looks like it's
some kind of serum can't say i'm super
super excited about it now this I've
actually also used this is the
bellapierre cosmetics mineral blush in
autumn glow this I want to review it
fully next month but I was really
excited to see a full size big product
Bell pairs a brand you often see on
groupon for very very inexpensive and
I've had hit and misses with their
products so I'll talk to you more about
this next month so that is it for my
