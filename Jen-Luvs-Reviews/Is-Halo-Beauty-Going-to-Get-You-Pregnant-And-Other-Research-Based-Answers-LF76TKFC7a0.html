you've heard that saying there's his
side
there's her side and then there's the
truth about to drop some truth in this
video a lot of truth hang tight hang on
oh you're gonna have to hang on it's
coming at you right now if you haven't
been watching youtube videos lately
which maybe you haven't you may not know
that Ozzie Westbrook came out with her
very first product from her new brand
called halo beauty and there was a lot
of hype leading up to it she had a video
that came out and she was really excited
about it really hyped it up and
everybody's thinking not everybody cuz I
don't know everybody but I would imagine
the the majority of people were
expecting something relatively typical
because everybody comes out with
something typical everybody comes out
with a makeup product or a skincare
product daddy decided that she was gonna
go and make a vitamin supplement so the
internet kind of erupted the beauty
internet I think a lot of people were
just very surprised and weren't sure
what to do with it and we'll get into a
little bit about you know the lead-up to
the launch and everything in my own
opinions but before we get to my
opinions I have a lot of information to
give you and the reason why I personally
wanted to make this video is that my
subscribers know number one that I'm
ridiculously honest and I am a thorough
I try really really hard to give you the
best information I am unbiased in my
reviews and I'm an ingredient junkie in
every single one of my review videos we
go through ingredient analysis with
makeup products and I tell you anything
you should be warned about about
skincare and makeup products that you
may be purchasing so I felt like this
video was very appropriate for my
channel I think this is very important
for you to understand though that this
is not a review I have not tried this
product so I cannot review it for you I
cannot tell you whether it works or not
but what I can tell you is more about
the
gradients because I have researched them
to death and I've researched them from
very credible sources now I am NOT a
doctor I am NOT a medical professional
but thankfully thanks to the internet we
have access to a lot of research medical
research to back up different
information and a lot of times this
research is used by medical doctors when
they aren't fully versed in something so
those are the sites were going to rely
on my main sources for this research are
MEDLINE plus NIH and PubMed there is a
website called MEDLINE that's ace if you
work in the health field there a medical
supply company they are not affiliated
with MEDLINE plus MedlinePlus is
recommended by hospitals like Johns
Hopkins for finding information I'm
going to try to fit as many of my
websites that I've used in the video
description unfortunately YouTube does
limit the amount of information I can
put in the video description but put as
many links as possible down there and
also down there which i think is gonna
be very important is the skip ahead
buttons because I want you to be able to
skip to the sections the ingredients the
parts of this video that you are most
interested in because I know it is gonna
be a long one another thing that's going
to be very important is that once this
video is live I'm not going to be able
to edit the actual video so if there are
any updates information anything that
needs to be tweaked as far as the
information contained in this it will be
either in the video description or if
someone leaves a comment that I find to
be important as in addition to this
video I will hit the like button which
will bump that comment to the top so
that you'll be able to see it so I'm
going to try to limit the number of
hearts that I give on this video it's
kind of filter through and make sure
that the comments that I feel like you
need to see are at the very top I also
want to encourage you to do your own
research my research is in no way
comprehensive I don't feel like there's
any way possible for me as a non medical
professional to know everything there is
to know about these products about
Tottie's product about these vitamins
and these minerals and these ingredients
there's no way for me to know everything
so definitely make sure before you take
these vitamins before you order them
make sure you talk to your doctor first
I did contact my doctor she was unable
my general practitioner was on
able to give me information on the the
supplement she said basically it
supplements we don't really know and
that was basically the answer I was like
great thanks and then I had an
appointment with my OBGYN and I had to
reschedule it due to a field trip that
was so much fun that I went on with my
son
unfortunately I don't have the medical
opinions that I hope to have in this
video but what I do have is some lengths
also down in the description of some
videos created by medical professionals
on these vitamins specifically so I
definitely recommend you check out those
videos I think there's maybe four or
five them linked down below that I think
are really really good and very factual
and not biased one way or the other
speaking of bias I do want to put this
out there right now Totti is an
acquaintance of mine I was in a contest
that I was a finalist in the Tatia had
on her channel a long time ago with love
of color and Birchbox if you remember
that from a very long time ago
so that was the first time I came in
contact with her I have met her twice
I've also been speaking with her on
Twitter to try to get clarification on
some of these things that we didn't have
clarification on before like the red dye
that whatever makes it pink I've got the
best information I could possibly get on
that part coming up but things like that
that I have from directly from Tati but
that's the thing anybody that knows me
knows who I am they know that I'm gonna
give my honest opinion they know that I
am going to present the most unbiased
perspective possible and Tati knows this
about me so I don't think she would
expect any less than me to be me and
that's what I'm gonna continue to be so
now that I've kind of given you a little
bit of an intro I do you want to tell
you what's gonna be in this video I have
a list of seven sections of this video I
told you it's gonna be long the first
one is a concern about FDA approval
we'll talk about that first then we're
going to talk about Web MD because Web
MD has been a big thing about whether
web and the MD is a valid source or not
we're going to talk about that a little
bit and then we're going to go through
each individual ingredient one by one
after that we're going to talk about the
cost of the ingredients we're going to
kind of do a little bit of a comparison
to see whether the cost of the vitamin
is justified then we're gonna go into a
kind of
me trying to talk about some of the
things that have been released by other
videos we're gonna focus on axe
revolution who released four videos
about these supplements those videos are
no longer up he's released an apology
video for various reasons you can watch
that if you want to see why I'm not
gonna get into it but I feel like he's
already put information out there that I
think needs to be cleared up because I
do feel like he's put some false
information out there that I want to
talk to you about of course there was
some good information in there boos also
some things that I feel like you need to
understand because he just don't get me
started we'll get started on that a
little bit and then we're gonna finish
up with my thoughts and opinions and
just kind of a final wrap-up of the
product all right are you settling in I
hope you're settled in because we got
some stuff to talk about so number one
is FDA approval I put up a poll on on my
Twitter about what were people's biggest
concerns about halo PD because I wanted
to make sure I addressed as many
concerns as possible and I put in there
in the poll options one of them about
FDA approval and some people were kind
of mad and I put that in there and the
reason why is because the FDA cannot
approve supplements they can't it's not
possible they just they don't do it just
a very quick story to kind of do a
comparison my husband owns a tattoo
studio and when he wanted to get
approval from the health department he
went to the health department and he
said hey I want the health department to
come in and I want you to inspect my
studio and I want a little stamp or some
kind of little poster or little frame
something that says that we are Health
Department inspected and the people were
like I don't even know where to send you
like there is no in Maryland there is no
health department regulation for tattoo
studios I know that that's creepy
but it's the truth it's the same thing
with supplements but it's not this is
not good because a lot of supplements
can have caused your body to have lots
of physical changes and I feel like they
should be treated like medications but
that's not a problem we're going to
solve today so just so you know just
because halo beauty is not FDA approved
does not mean that it does not do what
it says it's going to do because there's
no way to get this product FDA approved
it's not possible what they do have is
something called GMP s which are good
manufacturing practices
Toxie has said this multiple times in
her videos that the lab that she works
with does follow GMP s so there you go
we just have to trust her word on that
this is a quote from NIH the National
Institute of Health it says while a
supplement company is responsible for
having evidence that their products are
safe and the label claims are truthful
and not misleading they do not have to
provide that evidence to the FDA before
the product is marketed next up is Web
MD and I just want to talk a little bit
about this because acts revolution
really laid this on thick toffee had
said in her video that Web MD is not a
credible source and a lot of people do
medical professionals do consider Web MD
not to be a credible source and there's
a couple of reasons why well one reason
is that the studies that are linked in
Web MD you really have to look at them
to see if they're applicable to what
you're talking about it's the same thing
with cosmetics you can say ingredient a
cannot be put onto the skin
but if ingredient a is only at a 1%
concentration and mixed in with a bunch
of other things ingredient a is safe but
maybe study says that ingredient a is
unsafe but it's because of the
concentration because it's not mixed
with anything so you just have to be
careful that the information on Web MD
matches up with what you're applying it
to if that makes sense the other thing
is some of the information on Web MD is
actually an ad they are pretty good at
disclosing what's an ad and what's not
but if you're not really looking for it
you don't may not really know that
something on WebMD is an ad that's how
they get WebMD to be free which is why a
lot of colleges do just like Wikipedia
and places like that they don't call it
a consider Web MD a credible source they
consider the studies linked by Web MD
are credible sources but WebMD itself is
not considered a credible source here's
a screenshot of the Westchester
Community College in New York psych 101
class and it tells you basically that
WebMD is not a good source there's
nothing wrong with the article they say
it's just not appropriate for that
course and if Westchester Community
College says that WebMD
not a good source thought about source
for me either there has been some
concern by people about the fact that
Tottie's halo vitamins are pink and what
makes them pink wire they pink what dye
is in it keep in mind that food dyes are
extremely common in foods I think a big
concern is whether it's carmine or not
carmine is made from crushed bugs and it
is not vegan
Tati's vitamins are vegan that it is not
made from crushed bugs basically the
this is what's happening Tata's hands
are kind of tight on this one because
the people that make the capsule that
halo beauty is in they own the research
and development and the rights to the
pill to the outer packaging of halo
beauty it is a custom color that was
made specifically for halo beauty and
because of that they just can't say what
is in it and Tati is not allowed to say
what is in it so don't worry about them
not being FDA approved and Tati has said
they are FDA approved and they are vegan
but we just they just can't release the
specific colors used because she's
legally not allowed to they obviously
don't know the beauty community on
YouTube and that we need to know this
information think about any other
supplement on the market though whether
people will be asking about this
probably not it's I think it's just our
culture here in the beauty community
unless you have some kind of specific
allergy to would die if you do have a
specific allergy to a die I would
recommend you do not purchase the the
supplement I mean if you're not sure
then just don't purchase it it's it's
not a good idea the other thing I wanted
to mention before we dig deep into the
ingredients is if you are a pregnant or
nursing woman do not buy these vitamins
I'm going to say it right now I'm gonna
say it loud I'm gonna say it clear do
not purchase them there are so many
ingredients that I research that said
specifically not safe for pregnant or
nursing women a lot of them specifically
say not safe for children so 18 and up
is a must no pregnancy no nursing do not
take them you can ask your doctor but
I'm hoping your doctor will tell you no
based on the the research studies that I
read I just don't don't do it
I know you might be thinking about the
birth control thing we'll get to that in
a little bit if you don't know the birth
control thing oh we're gonna talk about
it just wait a minute all right are you
ready for this ingredient in analysis
are you ready to learn about supplements
everything you would want to know about
these things we got you and I'm gonna
explain it to you I read all this thick
stuff and I broke it down and I'm gonna
explain it to you so there's 21 total
ingredients in it taught these
supplements here they all are time
stamps down in the video description we
are going to break this down with five
questions so the first one is what is it
and is it in any kind of food do we get
it naturally from anywhere what does
this thing do when when it's purchased
alone what is the price of it can you
purchase it alone by itself as a
supplement what's the recommended dose
for it and then how much can you take
and can you take too much can you be
eating it and then take a supplement and
then go overboard and have something
happen
where's the line for cut off for having
too much we're going to talk about that
too for each one of these vitamins oh my
goodness let's get in here okay so the
first ingredient is vitamin C it is 60
milligrams in Tottie's a vitamin it is
water-soluble now there's water soluble
vitamins fat soluble vitamins and then
some other stuff we'll get into so water
soluble basically when you hear someone
call it say expensive pee they're
talking about water soluble vitamins
like vitamin C where if you take too
much it just flushes out of your system
and it's gone and it's done and your
body uses what it needs and gets rid of
the rest but it's also not great to have
your body constantly flushing things
that are not supposed to be in it I do
want to mention the food that this is in
so you can get a cup of strawberries an
orange a chopped red pepper broccoli
that will give you enough vitamin C for
an entire day so what does vitamin C do
it helps you absorb iron it's important
in maintaining your healthy immune
system we know this if you're starting
to feel sick you pop a little extra
vitamin C hopefully you won't get sick a
lot of people believe that it also plays
an important role in woo
healing it keeps your bones strong and
it also enhances your brain function now
I found a hundred thirty count of
nature-made
vitae melt vitamin C tablets on
walmart.com for about five bucks for
adults the recommended dose is between
65 to 90 milligrams for each day the
upper limit is about two thousand
milligrams so let's talk about 60
milligrams is what Tozzi has in hers so
this is about the daily amount you
should be getting a vitamin C a day so
you wouldn't need to have any additional
vitamin C pills if you ate an orange
that day it's not going to do anything
to you you're probably not gonna go over
2,000 milligrams in a day if for some
reason you do your stomach's gonna be
upset that's what it comes down to next
up we have vitamin d3 okay she's got one
thousand I use of what vitamin d3 and
this is of course in foods it's in fatty
fish egg yolks cheese fortified products
like cereals your lucky charms it's
probably in there mushrooms and tofu so
there's too many types of vitamin D
there's vitamin d2 and vitamin d3 I
don't know what happened to one maybe
due in three 8m I don't know
vitamin d3 seems to stay in the system
longer than vitamin d2 but vitamin d3 is
typically animal derived now there's
woman type of vitamin D that's vegan and
that's the kind Tati has in her vitamins
confirmed by her it is derived from
something called glitchin and I have to
tell you I didn't look up to see what
licheng was but you can google that part
I did enough googling you can google
that part if you want to so what does
vitamin D do we always see you know
drink a glass of milk and keep your
bones strong all of that it does it
keeps your bones strong it helps your
muscles your nerves your immune system
and helps you absorb calcium 120 counts
CVS brand vitamin D soft gels and the
exact same doses Tottie's it was buy one
get one free for eight dollars and
twenty-nine cents the recommended dose
of vitamin D is 600 I use for ages 1 to
70 and 800 I use for ages 70 plus so you
get a little bit more vitamin D than
your recommended daily amount but that's
not going to give you any kind of
overdose or anything I've got this note
recent studies suggest that healthy
adults can tolerate more than 10,000
IU's of vitamin D per day the salaah
vitamin D is not water-soluble so you do
hold on to the extra vitamin D in your
body now we move on to the B vitamins
now B vitamins are all water-soluble I
did have a subscriber reach out to me
about methylated B vitamins I did ask
Tati she was trying to reach out to her
lab they hadn't gotten back to her as of
the filming of this video so I soon as I
find out the information I will put it
in the video description the beginning
of kind of what she had told me was that
methylated vitamin B is most important
in vitamins b9 and b12 but that wasn't
in the vitamin she said she thought that
the b6 was methylated but she was going
to double check with her lab to see
which one's of the vitamin B's that are
in the vitamin were methylated and which
ones weren't so I will get back to you
as soon as I know so vitamin b1 is
called thiamine and she put 5 milligrams
of thiamine in the vitamin this is a
chemical that is required by our bodies
to process carbohydrates it helps to
turn the food that you eat into energy
for your body it's found in lots of
foods including meat especially pork
whole grains beans seeds and nuts
thiamine is important for the growth of
the cells in your body it's possibly
effective for treating kidney disease
and painful menstruation and then some
studies were done on anti-aging but
there really hasn't been anything
conclusive about the anti-aging effects
of it for this I found Nature's Way has
a vitamin b1 at a hundred milligrams at
I heard for about 5 bucks which of
course is way more of a dose than what
Tasi has in here the usual dose of
thiamine is between 5 and 30 milligrams
per day you'll probably be able to get
it from the food you eat you really
don't need to take vitamin b1
supplements unless your doctor tells you
you need to and again the vitamins get
flushed out so there's no chance of
having too much of it unless you have
some kind of medical condition
moving on to b2 there's also 5
milligrams of that it's also called
riboflavin I like that word riboflavin
it's got a ring to it it can be found in
foods like milk meat eggs nuts enriched
flour and green vegetables people that
might be too
and this vitamin are vegetarian athletes
pregnant and lactating women and their
infants but please do not take this
please don't people who are vegan and/or
consume little milk also may become
deficient in this this is also important
for cell growth and also red blood cell
production I found online at Nature's
Way of vitamin B to 100 pills 100
milligrams and it is about eight bucks
at Walmart the proper dose is between
1.3 milligrams for males and 1.1
milligrams per day for women treatment
for low levels of this vitamin are 5 to
30 milligrams so that's kind of where
this is falling with halo but again you
can't take too much and actually they
some people are treating migraines with
this with 400 milligrams of it there's
no evidence that this ingredient causes
anybody any harm at least according to
medical websites that I looked at we got
2 more B vitamins we've got vitamin b6
this is found in poultry fish potatoes
fruit but not citrus fruits and it's
important for metabolism again the B
vitamin is going to help convert the
food into energy that's its main job it
is needed for healthy skin hair eyes and
a healthy liver they also help the
nervous system to function properly
I found nature's bounty vitamin b6 100
milligrams for 7 bucks and it's buy one
get one free at Walgreens recommended
dose 1.3 milligrams for adults and 1.9
milligrams for pregnant women and 2.0
for lactating again don't take every
pregnant now this is one you can overdo
it on it can actually cause progressive
sensory neuropathy if you can if you
take too much of this they say no more
than a hundred milligrams now remember
talkies got 2 milligrams in this so I
don't think that's gonna be a problem
with this this is one I heard a lot of
people talking about biotin biotin is
vitamin b7 I have never heard biotin
called vitamin b7 I think it's because
biotin sounds like I don't know it just
sounds a little fancy you know it breaks
down certain substances like fats
carbohydrates and other substances it's
found in milk dairy products and sea
foods animal derived sources have a lot
of biotin in it a diet high and egg
whites can actually lead to a bite and
deficiency though so be careful of that
vegetarian sources are
not sunflower seeds legumes cauliflower
bananas cereals avocados just kind of
goes on and on there there is some
preliminary evidence that hair loss can
be reduced if you take biotin the biotin
must be combined with zinc and it is
combined with zinc in halo beauty right
now we're at a might for increasing the
thickness of your nails as you probably
know biotin is very inexpensive the
nature's made gummies are the ones that
I used to take a while back they are
three thousand micrograms for seven
dollars
Totti has three thousand micrograms as
well so you can get the biotin just the
biotin by itself for about seven bucks
if that's the entry at the ingredient
you're interested in adequate intake
though is really only 30 micrograms so
you don't really need it but if you want
that hair skin and nails benefit taking
more than 30 micrograms would probably
be necessary this is one that I know
some people were really concerned about
especially people that get medical tests
so there are some tests that are used
biotin levels to help decide whether
it's a positive or a negative result so
very high intakes of biotin to mess with
those results we're looking at 10 to 300
milligrams in order to have that be a
problem
so takis is three thousand micrograms
which equals three grams you need to
take at least four of Tottie's doses
it's that's eight pills in order for it
to have that problem with the biotin
according to the levels mentioned on the
websites linked in the video description
now we're getting into trace minerals so
we're gonna start with zinc these are
things that you only need a little tiny
bit of in your body you don't need a lot
so zinc is found in cells throughout the
body moisturizing red meat poultry
seafood such as crab and lobsters and
fortified breakfast cereals back to the
Lucky Charms those are also good sources
of zinc we've got beans nuts whole
grains dairy products they also all have
zinc in them now the zinc helps to the
immune system some studies say that it
is possible as a treatment for acne
which I was very surprised to find
taking zinc in combination with copper
manganese
calcium might decrease bone loss and
women who have passed menopause so if
that's you or if you're inching up there
then that may be something you might
want to look into and talk to your
doctor about I'm gonna read this one as
well it says although there's early
evidence that suggests taking zinc
together with biotin might be helpful
for hair loss most studies suggest that
zinc is not effective for this condition
taking zinc by mouth does not appear to
improve skin redness or itching in
children with eczema research suggests
that taking zinc by mouth daily for 90
days does not improve quality of life
symptoms associated with rosacea so
there you go there's that I did find
this ingredient 30 milligrams at
Walgreens for six dollars and
twenty-nine cents adult women should be
taking about eight milligrams of the
product adult men 11 milligrams toffee
has ten so she's fitting right in the
middle there you can have a zinc
overdose basically you're just gonna
kind of get sick to your stomach over
time it can lower your immunities and
also cause low levels of the good
cholesterol the HDL cholesterol which is
not good
moving onto copper I was you know I
never really noticed that copper was a
thing and I always think about copper as
a penny you know what I mean but that's
a thing it's a trace mineral one
milligram is what's in the halo Beauty
supplement it's an essential trace
mineral that's in all of our body
tissues oysters and other shellfish have
it in it whole grains beans nuts
potatoes and organ meats dark leafy
greens also have it dried fruits such as
prunes cocoa oh yeah
black pepper and yeast are common places
to find copper copper works with iron to
form a red blood cells it also keeps
your blood cells and your nervous system
healthy one thing that's beauty related
is that it helps the body form and
maintain collagen and elastin so that's
kind of the beauty related one
scientists have hypothesized that copper
may have antioxidant properties as well
without a sufficient amount of copper in
the body the body can't replace damaged
connective tissue or the collagen that
makes up the scaffolding for bone one of
my favorite websites called truth in
aging I'm going to quote from them they
say clinical studies have found that
copper peptides also removed damaged
collagen and elastin from the skin and
scar tissue
so I'm but I'm not sure if that's
topically applied or ingested I don't
know but they're you know take that one
with a grain of salt Vitacost you can
buy this 15 milligrams of zinc in
combination with one milligram of copper
for four dollars and fifty cents the
recommended dose is one to two
milligrams a day so that's what halo
Beauty has in it 10 milligrams is the
upper limit for copper I think will be
really difficult based on what I'm
reading and the levels of copper in
different things to go over 10
milligrams unless you were specifically
taking high levels of copper through
supplements and just overdosing yourself
on supplements you're not gonna get that
from halo Beauty last trace mineral is
manganese 2 milligrams is a trace
mineral that's stored in the bones
kidneys and pancreas is found in lots of
foods including nuts legumes seeds tea
whole grains and leafy green vegetables
it's considered an essential nutrient
because the body requires it to function
properly it's possibly effective for
things like osteoporosis and combination
with calcium zinc and copper there's
insufficient evidence that it helps with
PMS it also works in tandem with other B
vitamins to fight depression and anxiety
which I thought was really interesting
there's some scattered anti-aging
benefits because it may be an
antioxidant in your system but the
results and the research is kind of
scattered I found this from Puritans
pride which you're going to hear a bunch
of times - they sell really inexpensive
vitamins 50 milligrams for three bottles
for $11 so really really inexpensive no
recommended daily allowance has been
established for this but five milligrams
of manganese per day combined with one
thousand milligrams of Elemental calcium
15 milligrams of zinc and 2.5 milligrams
of copper is what they recommend again
websites linked down below 11 milligrams
would be too much so two milligrams
again is a very low amount so those are
all of the ingredients that you would
find in multivitamin these are nothing
that are out of the ordinary they're all
pretty run-of-the-mill vitamin
supplements that you can get anywhere
for very inexpensive now we're going to
get into the ones that are a little more
specialty the enzymes and the extracts
and the oils and all of that stuff so
we're gonna start with catalase Kali's
can actually
found in different foods including beef
liver potatoes wheat sprouts carrots
avocados pineapples cherries apricots
and bananas now this is the one that is
supposed to stop your hair from growing
from from getting more gray it has
something to do with fighting with the
hydrogen peroxide that's in your body
and that's what causes your hair to go
gray so it makes sense that if you would
take catalase that that would stop your
hair from turning gray unfortunately
there is no evidence to support the
catalase will stop your hair from going
gray I will link down below a lawsuit
that was against a couple of companies
for claiming that this particular
ingredient that was the main ingredient
in the product that it was going to make
your hair stop turning gray and they
were sued and it was bad for them the
brand's were called get away gray and go
away gray what ended up happening was
that they just had to stop making that
claim and they couldn't sell their
product anymore and they had to pay a
big fine for it to the people that had
purchased it because this was back in
May of 2015 I tried to find something a
little more recent so in March of 2017 I
found an article by a doctor his name is
Reis Hylian I believe I said his name
correctly I don't know hundred percent
he says I have not seen any human
studies giving catalase pills and how
effective they are in what dosage
therefore it is difficult to know
whether taking a catalase supplement in
a pill has a positive effect and if so
how many milligrams are optimal they do
still sell this stuff you can still find
it
I found a supplement called neutral gray
I think it's I think the website is
called both health supplements calm it
has twice as much catalase as Tottie's
and it cost 42 dollars it also includes
b6 by its and copper zinc horse tail and
saw palmetto which we'll get to along
with a bunch of other ingredients but
the doses are all different than what's
in hello beauty I also found it 10,000
IU one at Walmart it's 16 dollars but
and it also includes biotin zinc copper
and some other things the label was
really hard to read the image was really
bad
but yeah so there are other companies
that are selling this stuff and claiming
that it does make your hair stop turning
gray it's not supposed to fix hair that
is already great it's just supposed to
stop your hair from grain
and logically it makes sense but there's
no evidence to prove it I couldn't find
any evidence that this stuff was helpful
really in any way but I couldn't find
any evidence that it was harmful to you
either I mean all I found was that if
you take it basically nothing is going
to happen now we have rosehip powder
extract 100 milligrams of that rosehip
is found it's the the leaves that are
underneath the rose in some places some
places said that it was you know the the
cup of leaves there and then the
dictionary actually says it's like a
berry that forms as like the seed after
the rose has already bloomed and
everything so that's kind of where I'm
leaning to what rosehip actually is so
it's one or the other or both that are
dried in order to make this powder the
medical websites that I looked at so
that it's possibly effective for
reducing pain and stiffness with
patients with osteoarthritis and might
slightly reduce cholesterol and blood
pressure and it improves some symptoms
of rheumatoid arthritis and that is for
three to four months at 2500 milligrams
hallo Beauty only has 100 milligrams I
was able to find the solar a rosehips
500 50 milligrams 100 servings for about
9 bucks there are some anti-aging
studies that were done on this there was
one by something called heibon vital
it's a specific brand of rose hip powder
and there were some anti-aging things
that were improved but that was at 3,000
milligrams and again halo beauty is only
at a hundred milligrams so the evidence
suggests that she would need a lot more
of this rose hip extract you would need
a lot more of it in order to see some
results at least that's what the
evidence says but just because we don't
have evidence of something doesn't mean
that it won't happen it's just we just
don't know a docent a typical supplement
is 1000 milligrams and rose hip tea is
gonna give you 2,000 milligrams which is
a lot lot more so it's kind of hoping to
see a little bit more of this because it
does seem like a really nice ingredient
there just isn't a lot of it in the halo
Beauty vitamins
we've got MSM coming up next with it
which is methyl sulfonyl methane 160
milligrams in halo
Beauty the chemical found in plants
animals and humans rich sources of MSM
include cows milk coffee tomatoes tea
Swiss chard beer yay for the coffee and
beer drinkers I guess our falfa sprouts
and corn it also is found in fruits such
as apples raspberries and vegetables
whole grains and legumes and that was
from Live Strong which I tried not to
use as much as possible but I couldn't
find the foods and that was where I
found all the foods it's just the foods
part it's not the medical part it's
interesting because this this is seen in
a lot of health supplements for athletes
and what the major thing that people are
taking supplements of this for is for
muscle fatigue so there was a study done
with people that were going to run long
distances and they took MSM for a while
before and it helped them with their
muscle pain after they ran and not just
the pain but the muscle damage itself
also research shows that by taking MSM
by mouth in two to three divided doses
daily there alone or together with
glucosamine or glucosamine can slightly
reduce pain and swelling and improve
function in people with osteoarthritis
but with that there the results may not
have been statistically significant so
maybe a little bit of results not a lot
of results on that one there was an
anti-aging study that was done with this
it was a primary double-blind
placebo-controlled clinical trial which
those are the best kind but there were
only 20 participants in it and they
either received 3,000 milligrams or the
placebo over 16 weeks but they saw
significant results in the reduction of
crow's feet
firmness tone and texture again halo
Beauty has 160 milligrams this is their
dose was 3000 milligrams Gannett wish
there was more I was able to find this
at Puritans pride MSM 500 milligrams
eight bucks on sale for $3 and 19 cents
for a hundred and 20 capsules the the
note on the website makes me kind of
think you're supposed to take this three
times a day for that 1500 milligram dose
per day
doctors on these websites recommend no
more than 6,000 milligrams per day
that is a lot way more than 160
milligrams ie about alright you get
stretch break for this one you need we
need to do something we need to like do
like cheerleading or something pay oh
let's go hey-oh saw palmetto we're gonna
dissolve a meadow right now okay we've
got 160 milligrams of saw palmetto in
Tottie's halo b supplements okay so it's
a plant and it's ripe fruit is used to
make the medicine now it's native to the
southeastern United States and the fruit
was used medicinally by the Seminole
Tribe of Florida just fun fact there for
you it's most commonly used for
decreasing symptoms of the Lord enlarged
prostate if you search for saw palmetto
on amazon
that's all that'll come up is men
prostate stuff so this is where i think
the reasoning behind why it's in halo
beauty so it's thought that some types
of hair loss are caused by an increased
sensitivity of hair follicles to
something called DHT and DHT i'm not
gonna try to pronounce it but it's a
type of testosterone so what saw
palmetto does is it prevents the
testosterone regular testosterone
because even women you know men and
women we both have testosterone it
prevents the testosterone verted into
this DHT which is what causes hair loss
in both men and women so because this
the saw palmetto blocks that they're
thinking the the idea behind it is that
it's supposed to stop hair loss from
happening so if you're going through
menopause or are soon going through
menopause this is something that I found
out estrogen and progesterone levels
often drop during that time where they
do drop and the testosterone levels
remain steady so what saw palmetto does
is it helps to prevent the weakening of
the vaginal and uterine tissues so it's
it's an uncomfortable feeling that women
that are going through menopause feel
and it's supposed to help less than that
and Tottie's video the reason why she
says that saw palmetto is in there is
because some people when they take
biotin they will break out and the saw
palmetto is supposed to help you not a
break out from the by it's and if you
typically break out from biotin I was
able to find this GNC men's ultra saw
palmetto formula
160 milligrams combined with zinc and
copper is 2699 and that was in the same
dose as the halo Beauty vitamins every
other one that I found they all were
higher than that and they all had a note
that said not for use by women the
nature's bounty one is only ten bucks
but that one is not supposed to be used
by women and I'm assuming the majority
of the people that are watching this
video are women if you're a man you can
take the other one if that's what you
choose to do talk to your doctor first
the recommended dose is 160 milligrams
which is what is in halo Beauty this is
the one this is the thing that people
were really freaking out about and and
rightfully so
was the effect of saw palmetto on birth
control it's messing with your hormone
levels I could not find any solid
evidence that saw palmetto will lessen
birth control but however it may and
this is how I feel I know Tati said that
saw palmetto will not get you pregnant
and that is true it will not get you
pregnant
but no pill gets you pregnant the way
you get pregnant does not have to do
with putting anything here okay let's
leave it at that in case there's
children around you know it but okay
this is as a mom of two children I did
not accidentally get pregnant and I got
pregnant on purpose and it was hard it
was hard having babies having babies is
not something you want to do by accident
if I were relying on birth control not
to get pregnant I would not take halo
Beauty that is my personal opinion based
on the research that I have done the
might and the may is too much of a risk
for me and accidentally creating another
human I mean this is life-changing
I mean god forbid you know a 20 22 23 24
year old somebody's still in college not
ready to have a kid you know it may and
it does maybe they're part of the 10%
that it does I'm making that number up
and they're not ready for a baby and
they have a baby with someone maybe they
don't even like that much you know maybe
it's you know somebody that it's just
you know mr. right
now you don't want to baby with mr.
right now you want to be with mr. right
so if for me personally and my my
thoughts definitely talk to your doctor
but I if I thought that there was a
chance that I could get pregnant if I
was relying on birth control I would not
take halo beauty that's my opinion
hello editing Jen here so as I'm editing
this I'm realizing how long this video
is and how much really thick information
there is I know with me I can only
handle so much of this kind of thing
before I just start spacing out and I
can't handle it anymore I can tell you
as I was doing the research this took a
lot of days for me to digest all of this
so we're gonna go ahead and stop the
video for now and we're gonna turn this
into a three-part I believe that's the
plan for right now series on what I've
learned about the ingredients for halo
beauty hopefully you found the first
part very informative and helpful
in the next video there's going to be a
huge focus on ceramide rx looking at the
study talking about the the patent the
copyright the whole thing about whether
it is have it labeled all of that is
going to be in the next video along with
the rest of the ingredients of food that
are in halo beauty and either that video
or the third video we'll talk about cost
of ingredients my personal opinions my
responses to the acts revolution videos
some final thoughts things like that so
that's what you have to look for coming
up I hope you enjoyed the first part and
that you learned a lot I know that I
enjoyed making this video for you even
though the middle of the night when I
film that so I do have a wonky lash in
case you notice that try to ignore the
wool goulash as you watch this but
hopefully you know you weren't so
focused on that that you didn't hear all
of the great information I provided for
you in this video
so lots more to come in this video in
the coming days I'm gonna get these up
to you as quickly as possible they may
be on my upload schedule they may not be
it's just as fast as I can get them out
to you so you may get them a little bit
earlier I do have what's up and makeup
my makeup new show coming up so that's
gonna take priority for upload on Sunday
but I will get you the rest of the parts
of this video before any other Beauty
content on the channel other than the
news content so again I hope you really
enjoyed this video and learned about a
little bit

decisions on whether halo beauty is
right for you and I want to thank you so
