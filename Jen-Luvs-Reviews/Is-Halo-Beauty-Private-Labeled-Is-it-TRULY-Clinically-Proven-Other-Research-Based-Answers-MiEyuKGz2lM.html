second video that I've made on the halo
Beauty vitamins this is technically just
the second part of the first video that
I filmed when it finished filming for
this topic I realized I had over two
hours worth of footage I should have
known it was going to be a lot just
because of how many pages of notes that
I had but didn't realize how long it was
gonna take me to edit and it was just a
lot of information so I decided to break
it up into a couple of videos so if you
haven't seen part one I will link it
down below for you so you can check it
out there's a lot of information in
there that's not gonna be in this one
such as the reasoning why that I'm
making this video the fact that I'm not
a doctor and that you should always
check with your doctor things like that
that I feel like are important also for
this video but I can't I'm not gonna go
through the whole seven minutes or
whatever that I told you all of those
things so that's a section I definitely
recommend you watch if you're curious
about why the pills are pink I've got
the best answer possible for you with
the other video and we talked about Web
MD a little bit and we went through the
first set of ingredients all the way up
through saw palmetto in this video we're
gonna be talking about after saw
palmetto so we're in spent a lot of time
in ceramide rx you're gonna see like a
change of outfit and everything because
of course this was film the same day as
the other video but before we get into
that I did want to address some of the
things that have already been brought up
since my video went live in real time
today I want to just kind of go over a
couple of things people are talking
about in the comments one thing is when
I talked about birth control in that
video when I've said the word birth
control what I was saying was about
estrogen based birth control of course
I'm not talking about other methods of
birth control just
estrogen-based birth control I wanted to
talk to make sure that was clear
hello editing Jen here so I did want to
mention one more thing about saw
palmetto just in case I wasn't clear
enough in the first video in the first
video I did say that if I were relying
on birth control and estrogen based
birth control I would not take Tottie's
halo Beauty vitamin because there just
isn't enough research on women for me to
be a hundred percent sure that the birth
control wouldn't be affected by the
hormone levels changing due to taking
saw palmetto
I do want to make sure I'm very clear
that there has never ever once been a
documented case of a woman getting
pregnant due to taking saw palmetto my
thing with it was that there just isn't
enough research on it and it would
personally freak me out
another thing in the comments of my
video people mentioned that even taking
antibiotics can mess with your birth
controls the statements made in that
video where my personal opinion about my
personal body you have to decide for
yourself what is best for you so now
that hopefully I've cleared that up
let's jump back to the intro to the
second part of my halo Beauty supplement
video the other thing is is that people
of leaving been leaving comments about
the biotin and how if you I'm like
especially with thyroid testing and
things like that you need to make sure
you don't take biotin within a certain
amount of time before you take those
tests because any levels of biotin can
interfere with some of those tests so I
wanted to make sure that that was
clarified as well that was clarified by
some medical professionals that were in
my comment section so wanted to put that
one out there other suggestions we're
not just to talk to your doctor but
sometimes a pharmacist isn't even a it's
an even better source of information
than a doctor that was recommended by a
lot of people to talk to your pharmacist
this was really interesting that's gonna
apply to some information in today's
video up about the cost of different
vitamins that a lot of the vitamins
you'll see for very inexpensive
chemically derived supplements are much
less expensive to create and produce
than those from plants which goes
further to explain why vegan supplements
are more expensive to purchase we're
gonna get into that in this video but I
do want to make sure that that is added
in to you know your bank of information
even though I'm not gonna mention it
later I'm mentioning it now there's
actually a few comments about the
different qualities of different
vitamins how some vitamins are just made
better than others and side note thank
you to everybody who corrected my
pronunciation of Lich in which is not
Lich in its lichen so thank you to those
of you that corrected that because that
was definitely not something that I
looked up didn't notice just so you know
what's coming up in this video
besides the rest of the ingredients
which is everything passed saw palmetto
we're also going to talk about the cost
of the ingredients like I mentioned a
couple of minutes ago
and then the my personal opinions on
everything as well as my critique of
some of the information presented by a
particularly youtube channel called axe
revolution and i
want to let you know you guys know I'm a
huge supporter of small channels I have
done small channel shout out videos and
things and if you want to check out axe
revolutions videos and you want to
subscribe I am not judging here they did
provide a lot of good information but
they also provided what I believe is
very misleading information so we're
gonna talk about some of those things I
mean they made for video so I can't
address all of the things that pay
address the ones that really really bug
me are the ones I'm going to address in
this video and kind of just some of my
final opinions about this now that I've
done all of this research my opinions on
the launch my opinions on the supplement
in general and things that I wish had
happened and some things that I still
wish would happen and I feel like itachi
still has some time to kind of fix and
tweak and all of that so so yeah oh one
more thing in case this ends up being
just a two-part series I do want to
mention there have been a lot of claims
by people in the recent days that have
just started taking halo beauty talking
about you know the curing of eczema the
curing of arthritis the curing of all
kinds of stuff because of these
supplements I am NOT going to comment on
that
and the reason why is if I said let's
say I said hey that doesn't even make
any sense you've only been taking it for
a couple of days how could it possibly
be giving you these kinds of results
then I'm basically calling them a liar
without any proof and I don't think that
that's fair for me to do so I'm not
going to address that I'm gonna let you
kind of decide for yourself how much you
believe what people are saying I don't
feel like I have a right to to judge
whether something is working for someone
else when I don't even know that person
you know what I'm saying I mean does it
sound a little bit like that be some
surprising thing to happen yeah that
would be surprising for me but I'm not
gonna straight-up call them a liar but
definitely keep in mind that the placebo
effect is real and what that is is when
you believe that something is going to
happen you sometimes will see results
even if there are no results because you
want so badly to believe in something so
that's possible but at the same time
these may be real legitimate results and
I have no right and no way to tell you
whether they're real or not so that's
the only commentary I said I wasn't
going to comment on it and then I
commented on it but that's the only
thing only commentary I'm going to make
on that so without further ado let's get
into part two of my halo beauty
the ingredient analysis right now
alright we're making our way downtown
we're getting there were getting there
okay we're moving on to Amala this is
200 milligrams inhaler beauty PubMed
says it is arguably arguably the most
important medicinal plant in the Indian
traditional system of medicine called
Ayurveda the common name for this is
Indian gooseberry is what it's called
it's either either alone or in
combination with other plants to treat
among lots of things lots of ailments
including the common cold anti uses an
anti-inflammatory and also as a hair
tonic sometimes they will use it people
will use it just topically applied as a
tonic on their hair for hair growth it's
called Amla I don't know why I call it a
mala all the time it's called Amla and
there are some preliminary studies that
suggest that Amla will prevent help to
prevent cancer which is really cool but
definitely more research needs to be
done but I thought that was great and
the reason why it does this is this was
an article in the International Journal
of pharmaceutical sciences review and it
says that the research says that it
protects cells against free radical
damage and provides antioxidant
protection it can also prevent aging and
maintain strength through old age I'm
just reading it off of the study I don't
know prevent aging I don't anything can
prevent aging but oh well that's what
they say improves body resistance
strengthens the heart hair hair and
glands of the body the studies were
cited but I couldn't look at them when
the studies that they were talking about
that settled all these things I couldn't
I couldn't click home they weren't
clickable links I tried googling the
study I tried copying and pasting I
couldn't read them so but that's what
that particular article stated I had a
lot of trouble finding this for sale on
traditional American websites so I did
find it a place called jet comm that's
60 capsules for 24 dollars and they were
730 milligrams each again halo Beauty
has 200 milligrams
there was no appropriate dose determined
anywhere and I couldn't but I couldn't
find any harmful effects of it either
easy Ayurveda calm which I don't know
how reliable that source is they say
that an excess can cause dry skin but
yeah
were way lower than that 730 milligrams
in halo grapeseed extract at 60
milligrams this is an antioxidant as
well remember antioxidants are really
good for your skin they're great for
anti-aging purposes they're great for
all kinds of things antioxidants there's
a problem that can exist where veins
have problems sending blood from the
legs back up to the heart so this is
supposed to help with that it's also to
help promote wound healing and also to
reduce inflammation which is great for
the skin if you have inflammation with
your skin I found this with Puritans
pride a hundred capsules for a hundred
milligrams each
and it's a dollar nineteen with 50%
polyphenols now Totti has 85% in halo so
I had to dig deeper and I found a 300
milligram capsule at 90% polyphenols for
$17.99 so that's the one I'm gonna
compare to this one the polyphenol
number is important it seems as far as
the price goes so we're gonna say that
this is a more expensive ingredient just
because of the the polyphenols being at
85% recommended dose is 50 milligrams to
300 milligrams daily so we fall right in
there with halo Beauty 25 to 150
milligrams daily for general antioxidant
support and then 150 to 300 milligrams
daily for that vein issue where the
blood is at pump them from the legs to
the heart grapeseed doesn't appear to
have any toxic risks mild side effects
might include upset stomach but seems
pretty good as far as you know the the
taking of it anything bad that can
happen definitely still talk to your
doctor we got one more before we get
into the big one boy it's common pumpkin
seed here we go pumpkin seed extract
powder 80 milligrams I couldn't find out
exactly how the extract powder was made
I was really curious couldn't figure it
out but they have lots of nutrition and
pumpkin seeds rich in vitamins A K bited
vitamin b3 and folate they also contain
minerals such as potassium manganese
phosphorus iron calcium copper I mean
all kinds of stuff may have omega-3 and
omega-6 in them
and there they have a lot of protein -
they're really really good for you
research suggests that pumpkin seeds are
good balancing hormones in both men and
women so this would be a good good in
combination with the saw palmetto in my
opinion my uneducated just researching
and reading opinion pumpkin seed is
really really good for people with with
bone loss with osteoporosis it can also
help in treating arthritis and reduce
inflammation they're also good for
prostate health and the reduce and they
reduce the risk of getting kidney stones
I was able to find the actual extract
it's not the powder but the extract on a
website called life-extension calm its
water soluble pumpkin seed extract two
hundred sixty two milligrams is fifteen
dollars and then from bulk supplements
through Amazon is 250 gram bag of the
powder for 15 dollars it's a five to one
extract ratio they're two hundred fifty
to five hundred fifty milligrams is what
people should be taking or one ounce of
seeds so we are eighty milligrams for
the halo Beauty which is way lower than
what is recommended for effects it is
water-soluble so you just flush what you
don't use I wish that there was more of
this ingredient in there because it does
seem like a really nice ingredient there
just isn't enough and in my opinion just
from reading alright you ready for
ceramide I need I need some water before
cerimon I need to take a little break
here because this is girlfriend of
boyfriend let's get in ceramide rx you
can buy ceramide in a couple of
different forms you can buy it in pill
form or you can use it topically
ceramide is naturally occurring in your
skin it's kind of like glue that holds
your cells together so it's really
really important but you have it
naturally in your skin it's kind of it's
like an oily wax stuff that keeps your
skin hydrated and plump so it makes
sense that people would want this in a
supplement most ceramides are found in
wheat products but this ceramide the
ceramide or X is rice derived it is
found in nature in the wheat flour dairy
products eggs and soybeans there was an
article written about truth and aging in
2013 this is what they had to say about
they said I could find no independent
research on photo ceramide capsules
effects on the skin after
frustrating hours I eventually found a
study on photo ceramide capsules and the
perceived improvement of dry skin that
is not the study that goes with ceramide
rx we'll talk about that in a minute
ceramide deficiency can lead to dry skin
but nothing on photo ceramide
supplements in contrast the topical
application of ceramide does seem to
have some evidence behind it there was a
Japanese study eight people and their
eyelids treated with ceramide gel for
four weeks and they had the water
content of their eyelid on eyelid skin
was significantly increased but it was
for four weeks and it was eight people
oh my god a study I wish there's more
people there's also a French study that
showed topical ceramides with other skin
lipids whatever those are improved at
the skin barrier repair this is kind of
a fun fact so if you had a premature
baby which I didn't but if you did they
were they might have had like this
cheesy like waxy stuff all over them and
that was ceramide just so you know
well mostly ceramide not all ceramide
but it's comprised mostly of ceramide
which I thought was kind of interesting
website called Beauty Brains which I
love that used to have a podcast that
was amazing supposedly it doesn't exist
anymore but it's amazing April 2015
their podcast they talked about
ceramides and they said that a lot of
ceramides that are used in skin creams
and things like that are artificially
manufactured so they're not very
expensive but if you get them from
nature from plants from animals they are
very expensive according to the Beauty
Brains who I love but they also weren't
talking about rice derived ceramides
they were talking about we derive
ceramide so they don't technically
reference the ingredient that is
ceramide rx I was able to find of course
a ceramide that was for sale online
photo ceramides 40 milligrams that our
rice derived wheat and gluten free 40
milligrams ceramide PCD which we'll talk
about in a second along with vitamins A
C D and E it was twenty three dollars
and sixty eight cents us it comes in a
plastic bottle with a label another one
on Amazon $20 looks the same we get into
Acts Revolution he accused Tati of
private labeling we're gonna go more
into that but I believe personally the
private label ceramide PCD product is
ceramide PCD
with vitamins A C D and E that is the
private label product because you can
find it all over Amazon so since we're
here let's talk about clinically proven
if you look at Tates website for halo
beauty and you go all the way to the
bottom it says clinically proven and it
talks about the results of a study for
ceramide R X now just so you know
ceramide rx and ceramide PCD are the
exact same thing the study for ceramide
PCD is the same study for ceramide rx
Totti and James bought the rights to use
ceramide rx I just feel like that's just
a smart business move in my opinion if
they had the opportunity to do that if
they believe in this ingredient so much
I don't see a problem with owning that
name ceramide rx but let's talk about
this study now clinically proven is kind
of one of those wishy-washy things that
people can say without a whole lot
behind it and this is kind of an example
of that there is a lot of misconception
out there about the study and what it is
this is the ceramide rx study I read it
four times I highlighted it this is what
it was it was done in February of 2000
just a really long time ago 46 people
applied to be a part of this study they
were tested below their left eye for
water content of the skin they bought
these machines and you can read about
the machines in the study I'll link the
study down below if they showed more
than 50 percent water content they were
excused from the study so this was only
done on people that had dehydration of
the skin of more than 50% now because
they not some people out that knocked it
down 237 people in the study now for
subjects then left the study because
they either forgot to take the
supplement or they just never showed up
again so that knocked it down to 33
people that were actually in the study
so they they had them take the
supplements for six weeks and this was
just the ceramide PCD also known as sim
ceramide rx now six of them were male 27
of them were female the mean or average
age it says 25 point 1 plus or minus 7
point 8 years so that leads me to
believe the ages of the subjects were
between seventeen point three years I
would imagine it'll be like eighteen and
thirty two point nine
years these were relatively young people
it was a double-blind study they did use
a placebo pill and of course in that
kind of study the placebo and the
regular pill have to look exactly the
same because neither the doctor nor the
person taking it know who has what pill
it's like a secret envelope thing so
nobody knows so when they're evaluating
the results there's no bias from the
doctors they go in really really deep on
the conditions that these people were
put in before they were tested to try to
make sure that they got the best results
possible again it's in the study that
I'll link now one thing that acts
revolution talked about was that it says
that they removed the makeup during
their resting and waiting period and
underwent the testing after 60 minutes
so if people came in with makeup on they
removed it they had the people go
through a waiting period they just sat
and watched television for 60 minutes
and then they were given the test and he
was talking about how you know the
cleanser could have affected the you
know the skin if anything it's gonna
cause even more dryness because it'll
strip the skin of oils but we weren't
they weren't measuring oil they were
measuring water so I don't think that it
would make any difference what the
cleanser was but I wouldn't expect him
to know all of that but I just don't
like that he was spreading that
misinformation I don't think that a
cleanser would do anything and because
it's not gonna mess with the water
content of the skin it's only gonna mess
with but Weald content of the skin you
know what I mean it doesn't make any
sense so that doesn't knock it out for
me personally so then the study goes on
to say what they measured like skin
roughness and the width of the wrinkles
and the index of the smoothness and all
of that stuff there were 17 people that
ended up in the ceramide group 16 people
in the placebo group they talked about
how the groups were similar in age and
height and body and all this stuff
both groups both the placebo and the
treatment group showed improvement in
itching dryness and flush so that tells
me that people were going with the
placebo effect that they you know oh my
skin is itchy oh it's not itchy anymore
because they were thinking that they
were taking the ceramide when they
actually weren't taking anything so the
this is important the overall
improvement rate was forty three point
eight percent in the placebo group and
sixty four point seven percent in the
ceramide group to me that is not
statistically significant that's just me
looking at this from having taken the
statistics
course in college and taking research
courses in college that does not seem
statistically significant one thing that
there was a significant difference that
they're saying is that there was no mark
changes in water content of the placebo
group but the water content was
significantly increased in people that
took the ceramide so it is possible that
the skin will be more hydrated from
ceramide it is possible now this study
is all was only done on ceramide so when
you see those things scrolling at the
bottom of halo beauty that is not on the
entire supplement that is just on
ceramide rx so I personally for me the
way that I feel I don't think that that
is quite what I would have chosen to do
on my website if it were me let's just
say that because I feel like it doesn't
match up with what she's advertising you
know the advertisement for halo Beauty
is this supplement and then to say it's
clinically proven with all of this
information in there we know that the
ingredients can interact so to say that
the entire bottle has these effects when
we know that it's just one ingredient
that's not something I would choose to
do now this is the thing is that did she
do anything illegal no she didn't did
she do anything that vitamin companies
haven't been doing for years and years
and years no she didn't she did the same
thing that is commonly done all over
vitamin and supplement websites all over
the internet all over bottles everywhere
you go to supplement store it's the same
thing she hasn't done anything that
other people don't do the difference is
is its Totti and we're gonna get more
into that when we get to my opinion but
that's the big difference is that the
beauty community on YouTube scrutinizes
a lot harder than the typical I believe
the typical consumers so I think that's
where the problem comes in we'll get
into more that when I get to my opinion
but that's kind of where I'm at there
with that people talk about clinical
studies why didn't talk to do clinical
studies and I found an article and I
found this very interesting and I
actually tweeted it out that the cost of
a dermatology clinical study is about
forty nine point three million dollars
mahmahmahmahma million dollars I know
Tati probably has a lot of money I've
seen videos of her house I've never been
there but I would imagine that house
cost a lot of money
the woman has money I don't think she
has forty nine point
three million dollars to do a clinical
study one of my Twitter followers her
name is birdsong dis design she says to
prove something scientifically it has to
be peer-reviewed and reproducible
clinical trial trials are not
significant if ik proof so even if she
did do clinical trials that still
wouldn't be scientific proof because
that would have to be peer-reviewed and
all of that the other option I feel like
she had was market research
I don't know how illegal that is like
the legal side of market research but I
feel like that might have been an option
even giving it to friends and family and
taking before-and-after pictures I think
that might have been a good way to go
but that didn't happen so I'm hoping
that things will happen now another
thing that's really important to
understand too is just because there
hasn't been formal research doesn't mean
that it doesn't work it just means that
there's a big question mark and I think
we need as consumers to understand that
that you know if you're willing to take
that you'll put your money into
something that's a question mark that it
may work it may not work you're trusting
in you know what you you know know of
totty and you you're trusting in her and
you want to invest in it on a question
mark and that is 100% you're right some
people will trust and they will try it
and some people won't and that's just
going to be up to you we do have a few
more ingredients to get through we're
gonna try to zip through these as
quickly as possible let's talk about
horse tail it's 20 milligrams in a halo
beauty it is the field horse tail or
common horse tail it's a plant and
believe it or not it's actually uh it
would kill a horse if a horse try to eat
it which I thought was very interesting
the buds are eaten as a vegetable in
Japan and Korea in the spring this
particular ingredient is rich in silicon
potassium calcium manganese magnesium
phosphorus dietary fiber vitamins A E
and C among lots of other things
one thing that they use it for is let's
say you go out in the cold a lot and you
get those broken blood vessels in your
skin it's supposed to help with that the
chemicals in horse tail also show some
antioxidant properties which is also
really good there is insufficient
evidence for helping hair loss and
strengthening nails though but there
there are some preliminary studies on
the nail thing I was able to find this
for four hundred 40 milligrams from the
vitamin shop for $8 450 milligrams from
a website called lucky vitamin for four
dollars and fifty cents and the doses
seemed to be somewhere between four
hundred and forty milligrams
500 milligrams but I couldn't find any
kind of recommended dose there 20
milligrams in halo Beauty which is
significantly less this is one of those
that is should not be taken by pregnant
or breastfeeding women at all if you're
taking any diuretic medication you need
to make sure you talk to your doctor
before you take this because it could
mess with that but honestly the dose and
halo is so low that it may be
insignificant you know but that's one of
those things you're gonna have to
discuss with your doctor we've got three
more and then we'll talk about the cost
so we've got access stampin x aspects
Anthon four milligrams it's a cart
enoyed which basically means that it's
an ingredient that gives fish and
vegetables an orange or red color kind
of like carrots
it's found in salmon and roe trout
shrimp crawdads orange on red fruits and
vegetables and also found in dark leafy
greens it is an antioxidant ingredient
in dietary supplements and foods it has
properties that may preserve sight skin
and immune system may help prevent many
conditions associated with aging the
vegan forum is at the hasta Vita shop I
will link it hopefully down below if I
don't run out of room 38 dollars and 75
cents
I also found Puritans pride of a 5
milligram for $8 so it's not vegan from
Puritans pride the vegan one was 38
dollars and 75 cents the recommended
dose is between 4 to 8 milligrams 2 to 3
times a day
up to 40 milligrams a day so this is 4
milligrams for the entire day instead of
4 3 times a day the only thing that
would happen if you had too much is kind
of like when people say you eat too many
carrots you turn a little bit Orange
that might happen with this some studies
show that might lower blood pressure so
again not for pregnant and nursing women
and this one seems to be a really good
one it's just in a lower dose
glutathione 10 milligrams the natural
compound that's made in the body it's
also found in fish vegetables and fruits
but cooking will destroy it so it's in a
fruit or vegetable if you cook it it's
going to be gone it's also in beef and
lamb it is a potent antioxidant it
protects muscles from oxidative stress
promotes healthy immune responses helps
support
did health and this is funny the linear
formula looks like somebody clearing
their throat I'll put it up here it's
like there's some debate about whether
this particular ingredient can be
effective when taken orally though
unfortunately it's possible the enzyme
in your stomach just kind of destroy it
that it's possible you really need to
get it from food in order for it to do
anything I did find 100 milligrams $12
from twin lab at Puritans pride when
it's sold it sold between 50 and 500
milligrams some people are using it for
skin lightening just so you know so if
you hear anybody saying that the halo
Beauty vitamins will lighten your skin
that is actually probably not true ten
milligrams in halo in order to lighten
the skin you need between 1,000 and
2,000 milligrams and taken for weeks and
we're talking about ten milligrams
versus 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams so
anybody tells you that this could
lighten your skin it's I would seriously
seriously doubt it and the very last one
is another really good one it's called
alpha lipoic acid this one is actually
really cool this one's it's 30
milligrams it's an antioxidant that's in
lots of foods again it is made naturally
in our bodies you can find it in spinach
and broccoli and Brussels sprouts yams
potatoes yeast tomatoes carrots beets I
mean tons of stuff red meat it was
probably put in halo because it does
have some anti-aging and skin benefits
it recycles other antioxidants it's
actually now being widely used in it for
to treat a number of diseases and
conditions including diabetes multiple
sclerosis cardiovascular ailments cancer
AIDS and Alzheimer's it has actually
been proven to be effective for skincare
and anti-aging again studies linked
below which very rarely do we say that
it is effective it's usually probably
effective maybe effective some studies
say that it actually is effective you
can get 100 milligram dose of this from
Puritans pride you can get 3 bottles of
it for $9 and you do get 60 capsules so
if that sounds interesting to you you
might want to talk to your doctor about
just taking some of that because that
one sounds really cool in me I really
like that one that one sounds neat there
is no established dose for this but
general
500 milligram dosage in a day divided
into two times so once in the morning
once at night is recommended some
studies use between 600 and 1200
milligrams at daily for diabetes and
also for neuropathy again halo Beauty
has 30 milligrams are you ready to move
on from ingredients because I know I am
because this is one o'clock in the
morning so let's talk about the cost of
these ingredients someone who tweeted me
on Twitter that they were saying that
you could get all of these supplements
individually for way less than halo
Beauty and so I added everything up the
total cost of all of these vitamins if
you add all of them up was a give or
take because you might be able to find a
little cheaper it might be a little more
expensive I gave a range of between 200
and 250 dollars you'd also be taking 21
individual pills now if you were taking
let's say a multivitamin for your
vitamin C your vitamin D your vitamin
B's all of that stuff let's say you're
taking a multivitamin for that so let's
take out all those first nine
ingredients those first ones that were
like traditional vitamin E you know
mineral e kinds of things we'll take all
those out so we just did those bottom
ones those one that were more supplement
like we end up with between a hundred
and a hundred and fifty dollars for
those ingredients based on the ones that
I found kind of going a little lower a
little higher on that you are gonna get
a lot the dosages are different the the
amount that you're getting in the bottle
you might be getting a lot more of the
bottle but if let's say you just wanted
to try it and you wanted to be able to
kind of get the same effects from trying
it that's what I that's the only way I
can estimate it because of the dosages
inhaler beauty of some of these are much
smaller than you would get an individual
pill and also the number of pills in the
bottle
I can't match it up exactly because I
mean I could do like the division and
everything but you can't purchase it for
that so there's no point in doing all of
the division because if you can't
purchase a bottle then there's no point
in knowing all of that information it's
what can I purchase to get the same
ingredients and that's kind of how I
calculated it so it does seem that halo
Beauty is not overly expensive when you
compare it to the individual costs of
each I
remember we're talking 21 supplements
here I also did a little breakdown chart
I tried to find I've done this a lot of
times with ingredients from from beauty
products from you know skin care
products makeup products things like
that it's just copying and pasting the
ingredients into Google and seeing what
pops up what other supplements are
similar I went through a bunch of hair
skin and nail vitamins as well and try
to find ones that matched as closely as
possible so I'm going to put the graph
up right here one thing that I saw a lot
of people saying was I can just go out
and buy buy it's him why do I even need
this it's just biotin it's naturally not
there's a lot of other ingredients that
you actually I could not find in any
other hair skin and nail supplements I
searched and searched and searched and
searched the one that had the most in
common was the puritans pride vitamins
for hair time's release so we've got the
vitamin C at a higher dose it's the
second one there you've got the vitamin
d3 and a little bit higher of a dose the
vitamin b1 is a higher dose the b2 is
higher the b6 is higher the biotin is
higher the zinc is less the copper is a
little bit higher we don't have the
manganese we don't have the catalase we
don't have a zero to have the rosehip we
do have a hundred of the MSM where
there's more in the halo beauty it also
has horsetail at a hundred milligrams as
well and then we don't have anything
else that's the same and that was the
one that was the most similar I looked
at the nature's bounty because I know
this one is very very popular you get
two thousand five hundred micrograms of
biotin in that which is 500 less
micrograms than in halo beauty and all
the only other thing you get in that is
15 milligrams of vitamin C which is much
less than halo beauty so you really
can't count those nature's bounty
vitamin like the gummy vitamins you
can't even compare them to halo Beauty I
mean there's there's no comparison
there's there's not even close to the
same amount of ingredients in it so you
can't say I'll just go out and buy some
buy it's in at Walmart it's not the same
thing you know that's like saying I'll
go up by single eyeshadow it's the same
as a palette it's not the same you know
what I mean you're not you're not
getting all of that so you may find it
to be that you don't want the extra
ingredients and that's a whole different
situation that makes sense to me but you
can't say that it's the same thing
because it's just not
all right so if you didn't see the axe
revolution videos I'll kind of give you
an idea of what they were like they're
now currently down the channel made for
videos regarding Tottie's halo beauty
vitamins and then they made they took
those down and they made an apology
video and then I just read on Twitter a
few moments ago that they also took that
video down as well but what I feel like
has been done is that because these
videos got so many views and I heard so
many people kind of repeating these same
things over and over again I feel like
some damage has been done then I feel
like you know as someone that knows what
it really is I feel the responsibility
to kind of clarify a couple of things
that I feel like we're misleading in
those videos so so yeah let's target a
couple of things I'm gonna mostly focus
on their third video that they made I
fell like that one was the one that had
the most misinformation in it yes of
course they had a lot of really good
points but they also had some
misinformation so I'm gonna focus on
those so anyway okay so we've got H they
talked about the ingredient list changes
on the website they showed how you know
one point it was one ingredient list and
then at one point it was another
ingredient list and which one was a real
one I would say the one on the bottle is
the real one and when they put that
video out though current one on the
website was the one that was on the
bottle that I had copied off the bottle
on day one went off you put it up on
halo beauty's Instagram so I personally
have the mindset that if something it
does isn't right if they made a mistake
you should kind of fix it instead of
leaving it I mean yes it probably should
have been correct the first time they
put it out you know what I mean but at
the same time it's like if it is wrong
don't we want it to be fixed just sayin
the next one was a big one that really
bugged me and it's the definition of
private labeling this drove me insane
okay so the thing is is he was accusing
halo beauty and talked to you of private
labeling ceramide rx that is not private
labeling okay what private labeling is
is when you go to a private label
company that makes cosmetics vitamins or
whatever and you say I need to make an
eyeshadow palette or I need to make a
supplement what do you got
and they say well
I've got this supplement this supplement
the supplement this supplement and
they're already formulated like I
mentioned earlier when we talked about
ceramide rx the ones that you can find
on Amazon they are all exactly the same
with different brand names on them they
have ceramide PCD it and then there's a
few other ingredients in it now that for
meat I believe is the private label
formula if you buy just one ingredient
that is not private labeling that is
purchasing an ingredient that's totally
different I mean I don't know what
people expect that they expect her to
just formulate the stuff in her kitchen
but you have to source ingredient you
have to get them from somewhere right
you have to either you know vitamin C is
every vitamin C product private labeled
no it's not if I don't see is an
ingredient you know what I mean it just
doesn't even make any sense and the fact
that people are calling ceramide rx a
private label it is a new copyright on
ceramide rx at ceramide PCD with a new
copyright on it it's not it's not
private labeled because private label
has a really bad feeling to it because
it made it seen you ate that she didn't
put any effort into it
Tatia said multiple times in her videos
that she built this halo beauty formula
from the ground up and that's what it
seems like to me it seems like she
worked with these doctors to put these
ingredients together to come up with a
new kind of formula and I believe that
to be true from my research I do believe
she is telling the truth another big
emphasis was on Tottie's team and the
doctors and why don't we know the
doctors names and let's look at all
these websites that they show the
doctors honestly if I were a doctor and
I was involved with halo Beauty at this
point I would not want my face shown if
you said that let's even seen what what
he's what he did to talk to even though
he's apologized I taught you I don't
know if she's accepted his apology or
not but even though he's apologized he
has brought so much hate to her doorstep
do you think these doctors want people
digging in their history to see if they
once went to a Scientology convention
somewhere not saying that Alex did that
but apparently somebody did I mean these
doctors do not want the drama that is
you to beauty they don't want that
in their lives so yeah you know fight
vitamin supplement company X they can
put their whole board on there because
nobody's gonna dig up all the skeletons
in their closet we all have little
things that we don't want published all
over the internet but people who are in
the beauty space are extremely targeted
for the tiniest tiniest tiniest little
skeletons in their closet and they don't
want any part of it and I completely get
it I wouldn't want it either I am
totally cool with not knowing the
doctors names because of that reason for
protection of the doctors from the crazy
flippin people who would dig up
everything on that doctor it's not it's
not even worth it to them it's not even
worth it I get it
I can't even imagine how embarrassed
Totti must be you know with these
doctors these are medical professionals
and being like oh yeah and guru gossiper
they were talking about you know on
reddit they were talking I mean they're
they're so they're medical professionals
this is childish you know anything like
the amount of digging the amount of
misinformation people are putting out
there is childish it is high school
childish BS in my opinion the next thing
that I noted that he talked about was
the disclaimer on Tati's website and I
wanted to break down what I interpreted
that disclaimer to mean he interpret it
as I'll put it up on the screen right
now he interpreted it as if something
happens to you because you took halo
Beauty toss he's not going to back you
up she's not gonna have your back even
though you supported her she's gonna
abandon you and she's not gonna help you
and she's not gonna care because she's
not legally responsible because of this
disclaimer this is the way I interpreted
disclaimer basically for what from my
interpretation what it means is that
halo beauty is not making the claims
that are made on the website it's the
professionals it's the third-party
professionals the doctors the people
that are making these claims not halo
beauty she is relying on this team of
doctors to make these claims for you so
relying on the claims that these doctors
have made is at your own risk you have
to decide whether you want to trust
these doctors the Totti trusts so do you
trust hottie to know that these are good
doctors also you should that's saying
you should be asking your doctor and if
you don't ask your doctor or if your
doctor gives you bad information
halo beauty is
responsible also if you have any bad
reaction whether you talk to a doctor or
not
hallo beauty is not responsible this is
for legal purposes I mean think about
the lady that said she got herpes from
us a fora lipstick woman probably
already had it I mean I'm just saying it
I'm gonna say right there woman probably
already had a lot of people have herpes
it's not that big of a deal a huge part
of the population has it
chances are she just didn't have an
outbreak before the time and she
happened to go to Sephora the month
before and it's ridiculous
so this legal disclaimer is protection
for toffee and halo beauty you know you
can interpret that any way that you want
and if you don't like that then you
should not be purchasing these vitamins
you should not be purchasing them if you
don't like that that you know and I did
give you the breakdown on all the
ingredients and you should be talking to
your doctor and you should be doing your
own research so if anything is red flag
for you you shouldn't be taking them you
know I mean the last thing I wanted to
talk about was the fourth video he made
and I my jaw hit the floor when I heard
that he he basically prank called the
ceramide PCB people pretending to be
somebody who would want to purchase
Sarah my PCD and recorded the phone call
and not only did he record the phone
call but he published it in a YouTube
video and I looked up laws and looks
like that's probably illegal
probably it's possible I'm not reading
the page correctly but it looks like
it's probably illegal and it's possible
they could have a serious lawsuit
against Alex and you know Alex
for doing that and I don't know if he
says that it didn't have anything to do
with Sarah my PCD and why he took the
videos down but that was a bad move that
was not a smart move I'm just saying
like that was not a smart move but that
was those were the big pieces that I
want to touch on with Alex's videos he
had a lot of other points and a lot of
them were opinions he has 100% right too
but I just want to clear up some of the
things that he said they just weren't
true and just kind of give my opinion on
a couple of different things
so speaking of my opinions let's go into
my opinions a little bit about this I
took some notes and you know we can't go
back that's the big thing is she can't
go back and fix things but I do wish
that she had done things a little bit
differently I mean I just revise my my
shirt is like coming off at the wrist it
is what it is but I feel like you know
the launch video of course I think that
that is was a big problem and I don't
think she I think that it stems from and
I'm gonna back this up more I think it
stems from Tati not knowing her audience
she she talked to professionals she had
this idea she talked to people who have
done this before and she didn't realize
who she was selling to and I think that
led to a lot of problems so like with
the with the video the original launch
video she didn't mention that you should
consult your doctor in that video that I
saw she said that the bill pills were
magic that was probably not the best
choice of words
she also said they would work for
everyone also probably not the best
choice of words she had the anti gray
claims which I don't think are
necessarily the best claims to make
based on the research that I've done
there were no before-and-after pictures
she talked about clinically proven but
she didn't say why or how it was
clinically proven there were so many
questions after that video was put out
and you know I just feel like that is
what led to everybody going to WebMD
that's what led to everybody googling is
that there was people were trying to
decide to buy and you know we're in this
culture on YouTube where when something
launches if you want it you better jump
on it quick because a lot of us have
been burned by a launch you know we are
in this culture that you have to log on
in that moment to faced and you have to
buy it right that second so people
wanted to be educated on whether they
wanted to buy it or not so what other
choice were we given other than to start
googling these ingredients and that was
were so many misconceptions
we're laid down that was a big problem
and it's it's sad that it went down like
that and this is the thing too if she
had launched a traditional eyeshadow
palette she would not have launched the
palette showed the packaging opened it
up showed the shades closed it up and
said yay buy my palette no she would
have done swatches she would have done
an eyeshadow
she would have done a wear test like
she's so good at doing and I just don't
understand why that didn't happen for
the vitamins you know and the other
thing is is I wish you know the before
and after photos I wish that those had
happened it's kind of sits with me wrong
that she's now counting on subscribers
for before-and-after photos
it's almost feels like the subscribers
are the guinea pig kind of thing even
though I know that they're not because I
know that she has tested on herself
James has taken it other people on her
life have taken it I know this but it
feels to the outside consumer that the
consumers are the guinea pig sport
because there aren't any
before-and-after photos and these
before-and-after photos of the customers
are being used instead of people before
other thing is how do you know that
someone didn't want to impress Tati and
be posted on her website so they added
in a little halo hair extension and you
know to show the difference how do you
know you don't know and I think it's not
controlled it's not controlled at all so
that's a problem that I have with you
know just using customers and not having
that stuff ahead of time you know it's
just I don't know it there's nothing she
can really do at this point other than
use customers unless she uses it on
herself but then we have the problem of
the fact that Tati you know she she said
it multiple times she has hair
extensions she's got fake nails she uses
you know fancy-schmancy skincare she
gets facials she's talked about getting
Botox before me Botox does fade over
time but she's talked about getting it
you know Botox before Tati is not going
to be a good model for the effectiveness
of this product she's just not she's
gonna need other people to help her with
this I mean I guess that's where the
customers come in but it still is kind
of like yeah and that's the other thing
too is that if you look down at the
bottom of the website there's Tottie's
face next to the results and it's just
it's not the way I would choose to do it
it's not I wouldn't put her face because
it in the fitted the pictures obviously
been retouched as well you know and it's
right next to those results that
clinically proven and all of that and
it's like it just puts a bad taste in my
mouth and probably a lot of other people
it just it just doesn't seem right
especially after reading the study and
knowing what the study really is
that it was done 1718 years ago and you
know I mean it and the that was only
done I think it was seventeen people
took the actual ceramide and was only on
the ceramide and on the entire formula I
mean there's just so many factors in
there that I just don't think it's it
sets well with me that her picture is
next to it I don't think it's possible
in that photo to see ceramide rx even or
a halo beauty in that photo because
there's hair extensions you know it's so
the pictures been retouched I don't know
it bothers me so I'm hoping that once
she does get those customer photos that
that will replace her next to the the
the results and I think that the big the
big difficulty and I think this is a
difficulty in our society in general is
the difficulty of taking the perspective
of other people because we only see
things through our own eyes and I think
that's what happened is that Tati did
not see this launch through her
subscribers eyes she didn't see it
through her audience's eyes and I think
that's where the problem came from hello
editing gem here so I realized as I was
finishing this up that I didn't give an
opinion on whether I think these
supplements will actually work based on
my research and I hate to say this but I
don't know I don't know if they're going
to work or not because there are a lot
of factors involved first the dosage of
some of the ingredients that have more
research behind them is lower than what
they were in the clinical trials so yes
they're showing effectiveness but they
were at higher doses and in some cases
much higher doses in order to see
effects but we don't know if this
combination of supplements and vitamins
is going to produce an effect there's
just no way to know like I mentioned in
the ingredient comparison part of this
video I couldn't find anything else like
this on the market there are some
ingredients in here that look like they
could be very effective for hair skin
and nails but we just don't have the
evidence to support it at this time so
we can't say yes we can't say no we're
just gonna have to wait and see so now
back to the tail ends of this video and
there's a surprise at the end so hang
tight I think that she has most likely I
did not ask for this but I think she's
most likely learned a lot
from this experience hopefully halo
Beauty can move on from this hopefully
it works really well for a lot of people
and you know I wish I wish halo beauty
all the best I hope that it goes very
very well so again I do want to
highlight that down below I do want to
link a few videos that are done by
people in the profession that I felt
like we're really good informational
videos on the ingredients in the halo
beauty supplement just some final
thoughts from NIH and I'm just gonna
read this from them don't take
supplements in place of or in
combination with prescribed medications
without your healthcare providers
approval check with your health care
provider about the supplements you take
if you were scheduled to have any type
of surgical procedure the term natural
doesn't always mean safe a supplement
safety depends on many things such as
his chemical makeup how it works in the
body how it's prepared and the dose used
before taking any dietary supplement ask
yourself these questions what are the
potential health benefits of this
dietary supplement product what are its
kind of potential benefits for me does
this product have any safety risks what
is the proper dose to take and how when
and for how long should I take it I
thought that was really good advice so
with that being said toddie did not send
this to me in PR she sent this to me as
an acquaintance and edging on friend and
I hope Tasi still wants to be my friend
after this video but I feel like she
knows me well enough to know that this
video comes from my heart and I'm not
trying to be I know there's gonna be
probably equally a number of people that
say that I am being negative and too
hard on her as people that say I was too
easy on her and to me I feel like this
video was very balanced and fair and
factual to the best of my ability but
yeah this was with no obligation to try
or review got a little note from Tati
and I've got the hair skin and nail
Beauty booster by the way this packaging
as a Lobo G we're gonna open this baby
up oh my goodness these tails are huge
oh can I even take these things
bottoms up baby
all right we'll see you in three weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
