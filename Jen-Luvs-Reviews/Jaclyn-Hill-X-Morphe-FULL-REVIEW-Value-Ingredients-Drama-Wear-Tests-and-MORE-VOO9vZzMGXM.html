the jaclyn hill morphe palettes
i know you've probably seen reviews on
this before but none of them are going
to be quite like my review so stay tuned
this is my review for Jaclyn hill morphe
palette i want to start off by saying I
am NOT a morphe affiliate I did purchase
this with my own money I know there are
going to be people on both sides
watching this people that love Jaclyn
hill and or love morphe and then there's
going to be people that hate Jaclyn hill
or at least what they know of Jaclyn
hill oh and or hate more fees if you are
either one of those people I want you to
take those pre-existing preconceived
things and I want you to take them and
put them on a shelf for a minute because
I want to discuss the quality of this
eyeshadow palette not thinking about
whether it's morphe not thinking about
whether its affiliated with Jaclyn hill
and just talk about this eyeshadow
palette for what it is because I feel
like there are a lot of people that just
want to know whether it's a good palette
or not they don't care if it's Jaqueline
roll morphe we just want to go tell us
that's what I would be doing for you
today however however there is going to
be some discussion of morphe and
jacqueline hill later on in the video so
if you're curious about my opinions
about that stuff you can just either
skip ahead to that part or just wait a
minute because I'm going to get there
this how it was launched on June 21st
and then it was restocked on July 18th
so 27 days in between at morphe brushes
dot-com and I have heard that you can
get this at the morphe brushes store but
i don't live anywhere near one so i
can't tell you that for sure it is a $38
palette I used an affiliate discount
code to purchase this so I saved 3
dollars and 80 cents making my subtotal
$34.20 I paid seven dollars and 95 cents
for shipping bringing this up to 42
dollars and 15 cents you can't get free
shipping if you order $75 or more I do
not want to do that I sucked it up and
paid shipping you get fifty six point
two grams of product total in this
package so that's quite a bit of product
to this 35 shades with
out shipping my cost was 61 cents per
gram of product with shipping at 75
cents per gram of product that is really
really really inexpensive even though
this is more expensive than a typical
morphe palette the price program is
insanely cheap so when it comes down to
it even if you don't like half of this
palette you're still only paying like a
buck fifty program which is still a
fantastic price if you love house to
palette I mean even if you love a
quarter of the palette that's still
going to be a wonderful price as far as
price per gram the only other palettes
that I have seen that are even close to
this inexpensive or dubious place
palettes which will run you like a
dollar fifty to a dollar seventy per
gram of product so that's twice as much
as these all other shadow palettes we're
looking at like 285 305 350 or more per
gram of product so this is a really
really good deal this palette is made in
China but cruelty free kiddies says that
morphe has clarified their cruelty-free
status and says that they are cruelty
free now let's talk a little bit about
what you get for your seventy five cents
per gram including shipping to the US so
it comes in this white box here and it's
got Jaclyn on the back with a paragraph
of information from Jaclyn and then it
comes in a bubble wraps sleeve here and
then you get the palette and it is a
white cardboard
unlike other morphe palettes which are
in a plastic packaging and it's white
and then it's silver on the inside now
here comes the information about this
card it was a little bit odd what
happened with that it seems the
influencers that were sent this palette
were given a card and then the people
who got the palette shipped out of them
for that they purchased right after it
like the first batch of orders that went
out did not get a card and then all of a
sudden everybody started getting cards
again so I personally think they
realized people really wanted the card
maybe they didn't think about it when
they realized everybody one of the card
they started including it again I got
mine super late compared to everybody
else that I know and I watched a video
by Rob UT Christie if you're not
following her she's amazing so Christie
put this in her palette and I thought
that was a genius idea that she taped
this inside so I did the same thing
there is a little message from
Jacqueline
there but I feel like to me the shade
names are more important to me just as
Christie had set it up for her you get
35 eyeshadows in here with a mix of
finishes we're going to go into a little
bit more about what Jacqueline said
about the ingredients in the product and
all of that and how each pan is pressed
differently and all that we're going to
talk about all that later but overall
we've got a lot of warm and then we've
got this little corner of cool it's what
I'd like to call it new shades over here
pretty cool we got a couple ones over
here that are going into the cool range
but mostly this is a warm toned palette
now I'm going to show you a couple of
different things the first thing I want
to show you is that I did I am back on
snapchat as Jen Lowe's reviews and I did
do snapchat as I was testing this you
could see the wear time of it so I did
save my snap so I figured I would show
you some of the snaps right now so you
can see the wear time of through my
second look with the morphe Jaclyn hill
palette and I have to tell you that I am
very very impressed I as good yesterday
I put it over an Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer today I used the batter up by the
balm in the shade moonshot as a base
which is already shimmering I really
want to just see whether it would play
well with this and it totally did laid
over it really really nicely and yes ah
it's definitely still there that's a
good thing
I do feel like the shades were closer
together in tone so they have muddied a
bit more on the eyes like it looks like
the inner corner which is the way I put
it on with the inner corner light until
I turn my head and you realize that's
just a shine from the lamp it's all one
shade all one shade trying to move to
some good lighting so you can see can
you tell that it's the same color all
the way across that they've completely
muddied to one shade I know I can tell
can you tell I just filmed what the K
and this is Jacqueline Hill I shadow
test day 4 I only have the Jacqueline
Hill palette right here
the rest is Bert I wanted to see if the
shadows would work well with shadows
from other pilots that were not more
checking in on day 4 of the morphe
palette I do have to say my eye look is
a little busted
I was playing roblox with my kids and we
were laughing so hard I was crying like
messed up I feel like over on the edge
it's like my eyeliners gone that was
like wiping and stuff so but overall I
think that I look still looks really
really I need to go to bed
haha tomorrow is another day see you
well this I believe is day 6 of testing
the Jaclyn health how excited to use the
essence the I heart something I'll
forget and everybody wants to spend $20
on a primer so we got the cheapy primer
on this side and nothing on this side to
see if it makes a difference I'm excited
about today I think it's going to think
it's give me a good wear test day so
we'll see I mean I've got like four or
five different shades here and I've got
a little bit of shimmer in the inner
corner and a little bit of shimmer on a
look tonight's later than I thought it
was going to be when I checked in but it
is 12 hours since I put this eyeshadow
on that's a long time and just the fact
that I saw of color on both color on
both my eyes which i think is amazing
like are you serious
so this was the essence eye and this was
the no primer eye and mmm oh they're
both laughs are the same to be honest
they're both no separation of color
anymore it wasn't a lot of stuff create
separation of color than beginning
anyway but there's definitely no 7 I do
have a little bit of creasing on this I
do you see that right there where I do
not have creasing on the primer side so
that's kind of interesting
hello my friend so we are on day seven
of testing the Jaclyn hill palette hello
hi so what I did today was I put the
essence primer on this eye which is
different from yesterday no primer on
this side and use the shimmer shades
along with the matte okay we've had our
full day of testing it's been 11 hours
since I put this I look odd if you
remember this is the side with no eye
primer and this is a side with the
essence eyeprimer if you look the no
primer side definitely has creasing and
this one so this is this is the size of
the essence you can see there's a little
tiny bit right there but it's not nearly
as bad
this side the shade that was all over my
lid was the shade hustle which looks
like this
so I'll show you what it looks like at
full opacity and you can you can see
that is faded significantly I mean it's
been 11 hours but it did much better
with the Urban Decay primer potion all
right my friends I just got ready on
periscope so what's it been makeup this
is the finished look on my I say I have
the Jacqueline Hill palette you can see
that pool part so pool party is my liner
today which I really really like it on
my lips I have one of each Anees new
liquid lipsticks from Ronnie cosmetic
cuz it's so pretty as far as the Jack
would help out today I'm really loving
the way this look came out I wasn't
quite sure what I was doing as I started
like where I'm going to go but I like
how it's finished and as far as primer
today I am wearing the primer today
we're testing the Kat Von D primer with
it because the formula is quite
different from the Kat Von D to the the
Urban Decay one that I know works really
well you know the essence does not so
check back with you at the end of the
day and if anything cool happens between
now and then I will see you if not I
will see you at the end of the day to
test where time okay it's currently been
about eight hours since I did my
eyeshadow and it's still looking pretty
stinkin good with the Kat Von D eye
primer
all right ladies and gentlemen we were
at the 10 hour mark for this eyeshadow
oh my goodness so I've got a little
creasing right here but look you can
even see you can even see pool-party
perfectly still lined right there like
what are you kidding me what time is M
to say goodbye Q are the meets on my
face too mushy yeah I can then checking
a carrot coming right now at this point
I do want to do a little bit of shade
comparisons for you with the shade here
and some other popular pallets and
pallets that I own so you can kind of
get an idea of the different textures
that are in here and how they compare to
other brands you might already own that
way without owning it you may have an
idea of how these kind of feel and work
now let's talk a little bit about the
ingredients in this palette we're not
going to go into the comparison to other
morphe shadows yet that's going to be in
the next section because that doesn't
really have to do with the quality of
this particular shadow palette but we
will get into that I promise so I looked
at the ingredients and they're very very
common eye shadow ingredients there's
nothing in here that I would say magical
or revolutionary or anything we've got a
child and my sub based product kalin is
very common simethicone very common I
mean there's nothing in here that's
making me go yes it's so different and
unique no it does have at the hexyl
palmitate so if you were anti palm oil
this is definitely a palette you don't
want to get it has phenoxyethanol which
is the preservative in it it does not
have parabens in it there are some
ingredients in here that are not lips
safe such as ultramarine blue hides
rickland hydrated chromium oxide green
greens I've never seen it called that
but it's got the same number as chromium
hydroxide green that's what it typically
is labeled as I thought that was kind of
interesting ferric ferrocyanide those
are ones that are not lips safe so just
so you know you might want to check with
morphe if you want to put poppies on
your lips as far as which shadows have
those ingredients in them but other than
that I mean we really don't have
anything atypical at all the last part
that I want to talk about about the
palette itself without bringing in
anything else is just my review of the
palette as a whole I do feel like
there's a lot of repetition and shade in
here all of this is very close to the
Urban Decay Naked heat palette which I
also own like this stuff in here I feel
like she overdid it with the Browns and
the Reds I wishes she had put in a brow
bone matte highlight shade I think that
would have been very nice even though we
all own I'm sure at least one matte brow
bone highlight but it's nice to have it
in the palette I don't know I'm just
kind of into that whole complete palette
thing and I just feel like that's
missing
I also wish that there was a more cool
toned transition shade in here I thought
I think that would have been great
this shade 24/7 here it I find very
difficult to work with me personally I
feel like I have to kind of pull strings
in order to get it to work she says that
this is really nice as an all-over lid
color that's not my
personal style and I love that
Jacqueline does it but it's not my
personal style so I wish it was going to
be a complex shade like that I wish it
was a lighter shade because I feel like
I get more use out of it but again this
is just my personal perspective this was
created as Jacqueline favorite not Jen's
favorite so Jacqueline is going to put
in what she loved but these just things
that I personally don't love if you love
them like Jacqueline does you're not
going to have a problem with these
things and that's not right or wrong
it's just different and different is OK
my favorite shades in this palette are
the green Roe down here I love this
purple here the more I played with this
shade up here sissy I really like that
it's got a really nice fun shift to it
that I enjoy and that's pretty much the
extent of what I love in this palette so
that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 mm the goal is really
nice 7 mm that's about it there's about
seven shades in here that I love that
I'm really happy to have so that's about
a fifth of the palette so we're going to
do a little calculation here we've got
56 point 2 grams total divided by five
equals eleven point two four grams of
product that I really really like 42 15
divided by eleven point two five equals
I'm paying about three dollars and 74
cents per gram of product of the shades
that I love which is a bit on the
expensive side it's not outrageous
there's definitely more expensive eye
shadows and that honest Thalia I believe
lorac is around that price point so
still that is not out of range for me so
I do feel like it is worth the price for
this palette just to get the shades that
I love there's enough in here beyond
those seven shades that I like like I
really like these shades over here I
really like this shade I think this
one's very fun and interesting so
there's enough that I like that I think
it's definitely worth the purchase and
I'm really happy that I have it and
that's not to say the rest of these
shadows in here are bad I want to make
sure I'm clear because I feel like I'm
being misinterpreted a lot because
people aren't really some people not you
of course but there are some people that
aren't really listening to what I'm
saying I'm not saying the rest of the
palette is bad it's just I have it other
places and I don't need any more
it's oh this is just me and what I'm
happy to have and what I feel is unique
to this palette for me personally I hope
I'm coming through clear on that one
you
so now the palate review is done but I
do feel like just as I did in my
Geoffrey star beauty killer pilot video
I feel like I want to get into the
nitty-gritty of how I feel about how
this palette was launched and things
that I don't feel were good about the
launch and some things that Jacqueline
said in her video now I'm not trying to
throw shade against Jacqueline I just I
feel like this is something that I want
to express there's just some things with
this that are just not sitting with me
right and I feel like I want to tell
those to you so you don't care about any
of that and you just wanted to hear my
opinion about the palette thank you so
much for watching this video and I look
forward to seeing in another video soon
bye okay now everybody that's left this
is what I'm feeling okay so there are a
couple things that happen
I watched Jacqueline's video all the way
through and I took notes like a student
so at 3:48 she says what if we do
something completely different
completely custom but you have to give
me creative control but you have to let
me come up with my own colors in my own
shade that what would you think of us do
something completely different like 35
shades
created by me with new textures new
finishes new blend abilities but we can
keep it affordable because more if you
know how to do affordability and she was
like freaking love this so I did a
little ingredient analysis because you
guys know I love ingredient enosis and I
checked the ingredients to see if it was
different and I can tell you that it is
different except for for one kind of
palette so I'm going to show a graph up
here that I created of the ingredients
of the morphe product so it seems like
they have five distinct formulas the 35o
F and M are a significantly different
formula than the Jaclyn hill palette but
if you look at the 25 pan palette it is
extremely similar to the Jaclyn hill
palette I picked another 35 palette just
a random want to see if it was the same
as the 35 oh S&amp;amp;M and yes it was so those
have a distinct formula the individual
shadows have distinct formulas and the
25 pans have a different formula that's
what you're getting with the Jaclyn hill
College so if you've never tried a 25
pan palette from morphe you have never
tried shadows exactly like this from
morphine the only difference between the
Jacqueline Hill and the bronze mocha 25b
palette is that the bronze mocha says
may or may not contain Kaylin and the
Jacqueline Hill palate does have Kalyan
in it but other than that they're
identical oh and then F F DNC blue one
late the pigment from Jacqueline Hill
and it is not in the bronze mocha
palette because why would they put blue
in that but other than that they're
identical absolutely identical the other
thing is the different shades thing me
they're not exactly the same as other
morphe palettes but there's a lot of the
same going on in here I hate to say it
especially and even that kinds of guys I
mean really they're third not they're
not different there's sadly some
differences in here don't get me wrong
all these guys down here I love they're
they're different for me this guy appear
very different but I wouldn't say that
this is a palette full of colors that
are unique and different yeah you agree
no agree no it's up to you I want it
again it's okay if you disagree with me
I'm totally cool set the next part I
wanted to talk about what's the price
increase as you may know morphe pelts
are usually less expensive than this the
Jacqueline Hill is more this is what
Jacqueline says about it is more
expensive than their typical palettes
that you find online they're in the
plastic packaging but there's a lot of
reasons behind the difference in the
price increase which has to do with the
colorants that we use which is not true
unless for some reason she got a
different quality of pigments maybe they
don't know they're the exact same
numbers but maybe they ordered the
pigments from a different lab that's the
only way that I would be able to see
that that could be true well she's our
granny machine
Jaclyn isn't responsible for buying
morphe they're machines so that
shouldn't be part of a price increase
that should be a more feed business cost
I don't get I don't buy that so one of
the things that makes this palette so
unique is that every single shade and
this palette was prepped differently
which is a really big deal because you
don't hear that very often I do know
that Kat Von D a while back had released
blushes and she said that she they were
bad because they were pressed too hard
so there is something in the pressing
that changes the texture of powder
products but I can't say whether each
one of these is pressed differently or
not okay I'm going to continue with what
Jacqueline
and it's very time consuming and pedia
and one of the things makes they've made
this palette take so long to the way a
shadow is pressed is what determines its
color payoff and its pigmentation so I
went through every single color and went
back and forth with the last like note
this needs to be pressed more nope it
needs to be pressed that is true based
on my knowledge of the Kat Von D blush
situation this is what I think and I
okay I don't believe that any of those
reasons are why this palette is more
expensive it's because of something else
Jaclyn said which is why I think this
color is more expensive and this is my
opinion I have no connection with morphe
at all it's just an opinion based on my
observation I think it's because Jaclyn
ordered so many tests of the different
shades you guys I can't even begin to
tell you how many samples I went through
there's one shade in this palette and
the name of it is obsessed and I went
through over 25 samples about one color
that would one color and that's why I
named upset because I'm obsessed with it
she said she knew ordered 25 changes on
that one shade that's a cool
kathleenlights that's expensive okay I
actually at one point this under letting
it out of the bag because it's not going
to happen I was looking at seeing how
much of a cost to start my own makeup
brand I shawnee which is coming out with
her makeup brand and I was like I wonder
how much of a cost to make eyes shadow
so I emailed a lab it was a very green
kind of lab they were very specific
about what ingredients they wouldn't use
and would use and that was why I was
interested in them so this is how much
of a cost it would cost $750 per pan to
be formulated along with a $150 per
shade charge for shade matching that's
$900 per shade and that allowed me three
changes three changes now do I think
that morphe was paying that much for the
shade changes no I don't think they were
paying that much they've been working
with this lab probably for a long time
they developed developed a relationship
but even if this was costing them ninety
dollars per three changes and she talked
about how much she changed the shadows
in here like they're saying $900 even if
we say they're paying $90 oh let's round
it up to $100
I feel like the price increase is
because of that I also think that it's
partially because they know people are
going to buy this palette for a higher
price because it has Jacqueline's name
on it and it's just marketing I think
that's part of it too but I don't buy
that it's because the ingredients are
better I don't buy because the machines
that they had to buy I don't buy that
either and again this is just based on
my personal opinion I have no connection
with morphe and whether or not this is
true this is just my speculation based
on my background knowledge of different
things finally about nine months into
working on this we had our palette and
I'm like the shades are perfect like
we're good amazing and it was time to go
into production it was time to launch it
and I was like Linda you're gonna kill
me I'm so sorry I hate this it's not
right she was like wait what okay it's
not right I know we've been working this
for nine months that's a long time but
it's not right and so I went back in I
removed nine shades it's funny it was at
nine months and nine shades I removed
nine shades and I completely started
over with those nine shades so she had
probably tested each one of those nine
shades at least three times then remove
them replace them with other shades then
tested those probably at least three
times I mean I cannot even imagine how
much lab time went into this palette in
changing the shades changing the tone of
it changing the amount of sparkle in it
changing the finish of it changing how
much it's being pressed
I mean Linda it has said in her videos
the owner of morphe said that she let
Jacqueline change things as many times
as she wanted but I can imagine I'm
picturing this in my brain that could be
completely wrong of her just cursing
under her breath like hers gotta be
kidding me Jacqueline you know because
she knows how much it cost
as far as lab time to get all of these
shadows changed so many times so if
Jacqueline's telling the truth about how
many times she went back to the lab on
these shades again that's expensive the
next piece that I want to talk about is
the timing of the release so she said on
top of that more be also use branding
machines to create this palette and also
introduced a new grinding process to
make the matte shades even premiere with
David had to explain to me that the
grinding process is a grind
like the math pigmentation and basically
the machines work like double as hard as
a typical mat because we wanted to make
it really extra creamy so along with
like each shade being pressed
differently and the grinding process
that they're using for this palette it's
taking a long time to create them much
longer that it typically takes any
palette to be created she was explaining
why it took so long for the palette to
come out
well then Jacqueline I have a question
for you if it takes such a long time for
these shadows to be breath then why'd
you only have 27 days in between the
original release and the re-release
unless they were already manufactured
just curious now that's a terrible thing
to do I mean it's marketing it's good
marketing it's smart marketing is it a
little deceptive to say sold out but
it's not really sold out in order to
sell more pallets some people would just
say that smart marketing some people
don't want those kinds of things you
have to decide for yourself whether
that's something that bothers you I can
tell you it doesn't really sit great
with me but it's not a deal breaker for
me one thing that she said that I
thought was very accurate was one of the
things that makes this palette so
special to me is that there the coloring
here for absolutely everybody and that
is why I wanted to dedicate to my
subscribers news my subscribers are all
different people from all different
walks of life may you be younger older
boy girl men woman light-dark it doesn't
matter there's something in this palette
for you and I would say that this
palette is friendly for many skin tones
I don't know what happened with some of
the swatches on deep skin tones but
you'll find a variation of different
swatches on different people some of
them swatch like doodoo some of them
swatch really well I mean I personally
from my experience I feel like they're
really good shadows and I don't have any
complaints about them and I can see that
they would show up very well on deeper
skin tones and I've seen people of
deeper skin tones really enjoying this
palette so I don't know I feel like some
people not everybody and I'm not I'm not
saying because I don't know everybody
that's reviewed this palette but I feel
like sometimes people let their
frustration with morphe promo codes or
their frustration with Jacqueline Hill
cloud their judgment about the palette
that before they even try it they've got
this thought in their head of
it's going to be good or whether it's
not going to be good or maybe they're
looking for views I don't know maybe
they just you know swatch them very
haphazardly and didn't you know really
put a lot of love into the swatches I
don't know maybe they didn't swatch them
over a primer like I did initially in my
swatch video and that made a difference
I mean there's so many factors going
into it you have to look at what's
presented to you and decide what you
feel is real or not real when it comes
to those things but for me I feel like
it is a suitable palette for many
different skin tones if not all skin
tones now the last thing is petit and
I'm omitting that it's petit but it
bothers me and because it bothers me I
want to talk about it and it's my
channel so I do what I want to do and I
want to talk about the cake
okay just don't know about the cake
allow that Jacqueline had a party and at
that party they had a cake and on that
cake I feel like there's a hole in the
ground and the green grass grew anyway
and at that party there was a cake and
on that cake there was a palette layout
and this is what it looked like
so someone asks is that how it looks
like and jaslyne says no it has some
similarities but no and then to a
different person she says the palette
you saw on the cake are not my colors
she did some snapchats talking about it
she apologized to anyone that felt
deceived when they saw the pilot and
that the shades looked extremely similar
I feel like saying that it has some
similarities but no is very deceptive
for me personally we're talking about
fondant frosting versus powder eye
shadow of course they're not going to be
exactly the same they can't beat it's
obvious that Linda or someone else gave
a picture of the palette to the person
making the cake and told them to put
make the cake look like that it's
obvious that and I feel like Jacqueline
saying that the shades are similar but
they're not the same is deceptive and I
think that she was probably extremely
hurt that the cake picture was leaked
and freaking out and oh my gosh is my
palette even working on this so hard and
now everybody's seen it and I have to do
something no no of course it's not the
colors of course it's not similar but I
wish I wish in my heart and soul I wish
that she just kept her mouth shut
and just not said anything because I
feel like that's better than kind of
lying
you know I mean yeah we could push it
and say that they're not her shades
because they're not exactly the same but
girlfriends that cake was modeled after
your palate there's no going around it
and it really bothers me because to me
and it's I know that sounds petty but to
me the choices you make publicly are the
only thing that we know about who you
are as a person and if you're going to
lie or deceive about sold out times and
about maybe that's not her fault maybe
that's morphe I don't know but and the
whole cake thing and it's just like I
feel like I don't want to trust the
Jacqueline he'll review because I'm
scared that she's not going to be honest
is that unreasonable maybe I'm being
unreasonable maybe that's not you know
maybe I should be able to trust her you
could agree with me or disagree it's
totally okay if you disagree with me but
that's just my opinion I don't trust her
as a person in makeup maybe she's a very
fine person I may run into her in an
event and make she's a wonderful person
but I think that what she did was cruddy
and I don't think that it's good to lie
I don't so I'm really hoping that as I
continue to watch her that I will get
that trust back in her but I seriously
doubt it to be completely honest is it a
deal breaker will I never support
Jacqueline Hill again no absolutely I
will I still have no problem with when
she comes out with her makeup line maybe
I'll buy it and review it like I'm not
thinking that she's a terrible person
like I get why she did it I just don't
like it and I think it looks Cuddy you
know so that's it for my Jacqueline Hill
morphe palette review I hope you enjoyed
it if you did definitely hit the thumbs
up button even if you didn't like his
videos that's okay I still love you it's
okay we're allowed to disagree with each
other it's totally cool but I would love
to hear your thoughts about the
different points touched on in this
video what do you feel about the shades
about the quality all of that what do
you feel about the do pible myths of
about half the palette what do you think
of with the production of it and the
sold out Ness and whether it was really
sold out or not and the contradictions
of this and this and that and
I just want to know what you think so
definitely leave those thoughts in the
comments below thank you again so much

in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
