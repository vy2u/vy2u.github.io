kind of video of mine it's not my
complete review but this is what I could
get you before tomorrow morning when
this palette releases I wanted you to
have something from me as far as
official opinions and swatches of this
palette I did watch Jacqueline's full
video on this palette I also went to the
morphe website to get the descriptions
of this so that I could be educated
about what all of these shapes are as I
speak about them I'm also going to be
doing finger swatches and two different
kinds of brushes we're going to be using
a flat brush and also a fluffier packing
brush we're going to go ahead and start
with the first four in light beam silk
cream and MF vo in light and beam are
similar shades beam is a bit more
frosted and I like being quite a bit
better than in light beam has more of a
pop to it which is what I personally
enjoy I did feel like I needed to double
swatch these because they were just not
coming out what I thought to be full
pigmentation so I did do a double swatch
here so this is my flat brush this is a
color pop brush you can see it just was
not picking up on that brush at all this
is the fluffy brush I'm using this one
from Coastal Scents and I really like
this brush even though it's not super
expensive brush I like it a lot you see
that one's not picking up at all either
so this is a brush swatch of beam this
one of course comes out a little bit
more it is a little bit more pigmented I
can see not really using it like much at
all
Silke cream and MF EO are also not
swatching very well so I decided I was
going to pack them on and try to just go
back in and Tapie that didn't suck
it was representative of the performance
that I had seen on my eyes so I decided
to go through a pack all the rest of
them because something just felt wrong
about these swatches and I wanted to get
you an accurate representation of what
these shadows were doing that's the
first four shades with no primer you've
got two satin there and two mess and as
I watched them away you can see that
they do not last hardly at all I was
like I don't know what's going on here
so I decided I was going to do something
different and I was going to put Urban
Decay's primer potion and Eden all over
my arm and see if I could get what I was
getting on my eyes to happen on my arm
so this is the Reese watch of the shades
with the Urban Decay primer potion and
you can see that they lasted so much
better from the white test I do feel
like a high quality primer is necessary
for these shadows to work more on that
in the full review creamsicle doesn't
really go with these but I did want to
just show the four shades so we've got
faint sissy little lady and creamsicle I
do like these shades a lot the shade
faint is really really beautiful I mean
I'm a big pink fan I left Pink's so it
was really nice to see these I don't
feel like sissy and little lady or
swatching as well and I think that's
pretty accurate to perform it I find
that they definitely do better tapped on
with the fingertip since he does better
with a flat brush and little lady you
actually I feel like does better with
the fluffier brush Jacqueline said that
each one of these shadows is formulated
and pressed in different ways so you
really have to find out what works with
each individual shadow with this palette
which is kind of a pain in the butt to
like oh yeah I remember I need to use
this brush with this shadow it's kind of
annoying but I got used to it and it's
not a deal breaker for me so with the
white tests this does have primer on all
the rest of swatches have primer may
hang out okay especially for like
Jade's getting into the next four we
have butter puter pukey and hunts okay
let me just say she says that pukey is
supposed to be baby to kee Brown I don't
know any babies at puke Brown baby's
puke white because they drink milk and
that's all they're drinking so I don't
maybe should have baby poops not baby
puke my babies never puked Brown but
anyway that's beside the point one thing
I don't like about beans the first three
shape is they're very very similar we've
got a matte orange e undertone a neutral
chestnut shade and then that warmer
Brown I just I feel like they weren't
all necessary to have all three of them
Hunt's is definitely a beautiful shade
she really likes it a lot
I really like it a lot I'm totally with
her on that one it's a really good shade
but I don't like that those three are so
similar in tone they're different but on
the eye mixed with other colors they
look relatively the same there isn't a
ton of difference you may notice on your
own eyes but other people most likely
won't notice the difference between
those shades on your eyes and with the
white testes hang out really really well
with the primer it's pretty stinking
amazing how good the lasting power is I
mean hunt is ridiculous as far as the
pigmentation now moving on to the next
four we have firework Queen obsessed and
SB and firework I don't see it being a
super unique shade I know should I
supposed to be like this bright fire
working looking color and I really don't
see that personally the gold she did a
really great job with the gold foil I
love that shade a lot definitely best
packed on with the finger tip obsessed
she said she had over 25 submissions of
this color and it's good for an all-over
lid color for a smoky eye you know it's
fine I again I don't see it being
anything amazing I'm definitely not
obsessed over it and then SBN is that
smoky but neutral shared shade it's one
of my least favorite shades in the
palette I don't feel like it performs as
well as a lot of the other shade so this
is them all together out of these my
favorites are probably performance-wise
firework and queen
with the white test you can see that the
deeper shades stick around obsessed is
gone you know I'm really impressed with
the gold and the firework as far as the
lasting power I just don't find firework
to be unique the next four are Hill sir
Roxanne jacks and buns you can see in
the color swatches down below the ones
that I capture for the computer you can
see that he'll stir and rocks and really
the big difference between those two is
one of shimmer and one's a mess Jack's
is another map it's deeper so if you
like if Hillstrom Roxanne had a baby
like a matte baby then it would probably
be Jax they're just not super unique in
my opinion they work great but they I
feel like they're very similar even buns
really isn't that much different than
the other three overall when you put
them on the eyes I definitely don't
recommend using these all in a look
together there's so many options of
color in this palette that you can pick
any one of these you know total
crapshoot it pick one and then move on
to a different part of a palette because
this this section kind of made me a
little sleepy it reminds me a lot of the
Urban Decay Naked heat palette does that
if you get naked heat vibes off this of
course Jacqueline may not have known
about the naked heat when she made this
palette but gives me naked heat vibes
and the staying power on these four are
it's insane it's so good with that
primer underneath just really really
good then next four are obviously you
know that red is really not supposed to
be with those other cool guys but that's
just the way the floor worked out we've
got cranapple royalty twerk and hustle
cranapple is a cranberry shimmer she
says it's perfect for all over the lid I
don't find this to pick up well with a
brush I think the swatch is accurate
there I feel like a fingertip definitely
works best with this
I really like royalty a lot it does have
a little bit of silver glitter in it but
I don't feel like that translate
translates well to the eyes but what I
love about both royalty and twerk is
that their colors really transfer to the
eye without changing to a brown or a
grey they really stay that blue purple
blue kind of color I twerk I think it's
very unique I'm very excited about to
work it's a very fun shade and then
Hustle is that cool tone shimmer it's a
pale gray with a little bit of purple in
it I'm not a huge fan of that one it
just kind of falls flat for me but I
really like royalty and to work a lot
and cranapple is a great shade too and
wiping them off you can see that that
end shade hustle is gone but the rest of
them hang out there really well and now
we're going back into some of the Browns
we have Meeks 24/7 chip and mocha Meeks
is a and outright bronze 24/7 that she
said was the trickiest color in the
palette this is one that you have to
apply with a finger or a very wet brush
and then chip is a matte brown with a
pool purplish undertone and then mocha
is a warm fuzzy Brown this is another
row where I feel like she just overdid
it on the same kinds of colors oh I
forgot to mention I had to refilm this
these next two sets of swatches because
somehow the footage didn't something
happen to the footage so you're going to
see different brushes being used this is
the makeup geek foiled brush right now
the first one and then the second one is
a Julius place fluffier brush so it's
different brushes but you'll see that
we're getting the same kind of thing the
same kind of brown over and over again
which I feel like more if he does all
the time but I feel like I wish that
Jaclyn hadn't done that hadn't gone that
route I know they're all unique in their
own way but on the eye it's like they
all just kind of look the same which was
a little disappointing to me not to say
they aren't beautiful but they are kind
of all the same I think 24/7 really is a
difficult shade to work with I haven't
had fun using that shape of the other
ones I really like with the white chest
they all last really really well
and the next four is probably my
favorite four in the palette because I
find them to be very fun and relatively
unique we have pool party Jada diva and
enchanted pool party I wore is liner one
day that you'll see in the full review
and it lasted all day I mean it's just a
beautiful pop of color same thing with
Jada they're just really really pretty
if you dig those turquoise colors I even
Steve all over my eyelid one day and
that was absolutely gorgeous I actually
have a tutorial for that look I'll link
it down below and then enchanted I
rarely see a deep matte green so I was
really excited to see that so along with
some of the boring that I feel like
Jacqueline put in here you have things
like this that are super unique I feel
and very very fun I think my favorite
shade in here is definitely diva
for the white test on this you can see
they all have last really really well I
mean I'm super impressed with the
lasting power wit like I said with a
primer and again more info on that on
the full review and finally we have the
last three Central Park soda pop and of
this Central Park is a lot like that
neat 24/7 chip mocha final line it's
kind of like song like I just bored and
want to fall asleep with that one you
know it's just very typical and kind of
boring to me but I really like soda pop
a lot I feel like it applies beautifully
it does exactly what it's supposed to do
and I don't know how she did it but she
made it stay purple which totally
impressed me with the black it is not
the blackest black that there is I am
going to be swatching this black against
other blacks just you can see the
difference in the full review but again
I just wanted to show you before it went
back on sale and definitely a huge fan
of soda pop in this one the other ones
or I can kind of do without
white test again absolutely awesome
laughing power on flippin believable so
final thoughts on this for now I really
really like this palette I have to tell
you the quality of the shadows is
wonderful we're going to go all into
ingredients and everything I made a
chart for you of all of the ingredients
you can see comparisons with other of
the morphe palette I've got so much info
for you coming in the next video I
definitely find this palette fun to work
with I feel like the lasting power is
definitely there with a primer if you're
having trouble with lasting power I
definitely recommend that you switch up
your primer and see if that helps but
overall I'm having a lot of fun with
these they blend really nicely and I am
very much enjoying this palette do I
wish that she had made some different
shades absolutely but I do feel like
there are a lot of hits in this palette

them helpful if you did definitely make
