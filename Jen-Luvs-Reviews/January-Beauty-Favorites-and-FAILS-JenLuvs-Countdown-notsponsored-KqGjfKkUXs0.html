my favorite video of the month my
monthly favorites and fails countdown
it's coming at you right now if you've
never seen one of my favorites and fails
videos they are super super fun what we
do is we start with the worst product I
tried this month and we countdown all
the way up to the best product I tried
this month so let's jump right into it
with number 10
hey this product was sent to me in PR so
the next time someone comes after me and
says you only say nice things about
things you get in PR I will remind them
of this moment this I heard really good
things about this is the june jacobs
papaya purifying enzyme mask when I got
my PR box from June Jacobs
I remember in I think it was Instagram
stories I got some private message of
people saying oh my gosh the enzyme mask
is awesome this stuff burns my face I'm
gonna insert a picture right here of my
poor red face it didn't hurt very much I
guess maybe I heard a little bit while
it was on but when I took it off I
realized how red my face was and it
continued to feel burning I went to bed
not too long after that what I wash it
off and in the morning my face was fine
but still I don't know I left it on the
for the required amount I mean it says
leave it on for three to ten minutes
maybe I just left it on too long I think
I left it on closer to the ten minutes
so maybe I just need to try it again but
yeah I'm a little scared to try it again
even if I just do it for the three
minutes it kind of freaks me out so if
you have experience with the June Jacobs
papaya purifying enzyme mask how long do
you leave it on for because I think I
might have left it on too long and I'm
really really scared to try it again but
just because I've never had a reaction
to face masks like that before in my
entire life that is why this is at
Number ten even though part of it might
be my fault number nine is a product
that I got in my Ipsy bag and it is a
deluxe sample of the city color contour
palette I remember trying this I think
on periscope getting ready to film
what's up and makeup we do that every
Friday like Friday afternoon I get ready
on the app periscope it's a Twitter app
if you don't know anything about it it's
a livestream app that
get ready on and there's usually like 30
of us over there it's a nice little
small group and we have a lot of fun but
anyway I was using this and I used the
deepest shade to contour and went on
super dark I used like a real dense flat
brush almost like a NARS eita brush but
it's not the NARS eita brush and I was
blending it out and it was like gone
when I blended it out I was like what is
going on it went from being like super
opaque and dark to like ghosted
completely gone so what I ended up doing
in order to get this this shade to work
was to just put it on with a less dense
brush and just not need to blend it out
you know just to slowly build it up
rather than starting with dark but it
was just kind of a pain in the tush you
know it's not that it's a bad product
it's not a good product the other thing
about it is that it the last in power
was terrible absolutely terrible the
bronze shade I probably won't ever use
because I don't really use shades that
are this warm and the white shade I
probably won't use either because I
don't really like white highlights
except for maybe a little bit in my
inner corner and I don't think I would
ever reach for this so I think I'm gonna
pass this on to a friend of mine and I
think this is gonna leave my life
because it just didn't work for me the
next one was another disappointing one
and I just talked about this in my
boxycharm unboxing video because I was
so disappointed I had to include it in
two videos this is the Tarte TARDIS
mascara and this was the thing this is
what really made me mad as I remembered
that I really like this mascara and I
was going on and on about it in my
December box driving video no no no it
just fell flat and like I said in the
box charm video it just didn't it didn't
give me anything better than an average
six dollar mascara from the drugstore
and that's things expensive so I expect
more from a high-end product and this
one's gonna be a no for me next up is
one it's taken me a long time to break
up with this one this one I've had high
hopes for I really wanted to love it but
my last experience with this product
made me just go I think that this is
gonna have to go back to the store I
just I can't with this anymore
it's the Fendi Beauty eyeshadow palette
the galaxy palette okay before you go
ham on me I tried multiple shades with
this I tried it with two different kinds
of glitter glue I tried it with just
regular
or a a couple of different types of
primer and the look after about six
hours of wearing this is a disaster what
ends up happening is I end up with
glitter on my face doesn't matter which
glitter glue I use the next end the Too
Faced I end up with glitter down on my
face and then also the actual shadows
are like migrating and squishing and
weird ways so like let's say I put you
know this shade all over my lid okay in
a few hours it's only like halfway down
my lid and it just completely
disappeared from closer up to my crease
what what are you doing like it's not a
complete mind of its own I don't know
like who possessed this palette but
maybe Rihanna needs a checker Factory
and make sure that they're not
possessing the palettes with evil
spirits or something that are just
wreaking havoc on my eyelids and having
doing whatever they want to do it's just
I can't get it to stay the look that I
made for more than a few hours before
things just start migrating everywhere
so this is definitely unknown especially
at this price point I just can't I just
can't with this I just can't and it
makes me sad because I really had high
hopes for this I loved shimmery
eyeshadows I love colors.i love glitters
I love all of that but the formula just
was a big note for me and I'm hoping
that if she comes out with something
again in the future she tweaks it for me
a little bit because I would definitely
be willing to give it another shot the
other thing is that the fingerprint
thing is just it's not cute it's not a
good look the fingerprints are not a
good look it looks 30 now we're starting
to get into things that I just think are
just kind of okay this is the sugar
palette by face candy this was sent to
me by shop hush I did do a full shop
hush review on the anasazi of Beverly
Hills palette dupes that they sell there
that are by bad habit this is a
different brand called face candy and
this is supposed to be a dupe for the
two-faced peach palette the sweet peach
palette now there's multiple peach
palettes this is the original sweet
peach palette I have to say I do really
like the original sweet peach palette I
like the shades I do enjoy it it's not
my favorite palette of all time but I do
really like it this one here the shades
muddy together so bad on me like they
I can't get the colors to look unique
especially in this like half you know I
think there's a little bit better if I
mix in these greens but for the most
part it's just it all ends up pushing
into just one very bland look the only
people I think that would enjoy this
would be people that like very toned
down calm looks may enjoy creating a
little bit of variation on their lids
with this but I definitely don't think
it's even worth the inexpensive price
for this I didn't I don't enjoy using it
I'm gonna pass this one on as well I
just know this is gonna be a no for me
unfortunately this one is kind of a half
yes half no because if this product was
fifty dollars forty five fifty dollars I
would be so so happy but the price point
on this is so stinkin ridiculous that I
just I that's why that's the only reason
why I'm on the fence with this one and
some of you're gonna be mad at me I know
but I got it speak from my heart okay
this is the Pat McGrath mothership
pallet I got this at the VIP Rouge sale
and I will tell you some of these shades
over here like these four over here I am
absolutely in love with because they are
so unique to my collection
it's actually unique to my collection
it's something different these two
shades especially I am loving actually
know these two shades right here are
money they're so good
because they've got like this duochrome
shift that I don't have anywhere else in
my collection these two shades as well
are absolutely beautiful the statins
over here and the mats are also really
really good I just can't believe I paid
I paid $125 for this thing I think I'm
just still like hurt and my soul that I
did that I didn't spend that much
because I did have the discount what I
spent on it like 100 bucks or something
after you take off the 20% off yeah like
a hundred bucks or something but still I
don't think that eyeshadow should ever
cost a hundred dollars at its pressed
powders III mean the packaging is really
really really nice it's very very like
it feels luxe I mean at least she gave
us some really luxe packaging I mean the
mirror is beautiful but it's just I just
think that it's just too expensive but
that's why it's in the
middle of the countdown because the
quality is really really good the price
points just ridiculous in my opinion so
it's good but is it worth the price for
me no am I happy to have it though yeah
am I gonna return it no I'm not
returning it I'm keeping it as you may
know if you've been around for a while I
like to try skincare lines all together
as a brand for a long period of time and
before I give my full review now because
these products were just kind of okay
for me I'm not gonna do a complete video
I'm just fitting them into my favorites
and I did want to tell you about them
because there's one particular product
if you're gonna get something from this
line I would definitely recommend one
product this is the brand new do this
was sent to me for review and not
sponsored they have a gel cleanser they
sent me they also sent me an eye cream
and a moisturizer and then a toner I did
look at the ingredients for this and the
ingredients look very good I did not see
any magical results I was coming off of
the best damn Beauty skincare which was
my favorite products of 2017 so I don't
know if I'm just like that stuff was so
good that this stuff is just good like I
went from so good to good and that's why
I'm kind of like they're fine you know
but I mean I okay let me tell you about
the thing that I really liked I really
really liked the toner a lot if you're
looking for a good toner I would
definitely recommend this one I brought
the box over so that I could tell you
some of the ingredients we've got water
glycerin oat kernel extract which I
don't know a whole lot about next is
cocoa cap relate which is another thing
I don't know a lot about but then we
have manuka honey which is a really good
skin care ingredient and then aloe vera
extract which is also something I love
to see in skin care some other really
interesting ingredients there's also
some witch hazel in here and I just
found this to be a very pleasant toner
it's got a very nice scent to it it's
like a very light citrusy kind of scent
but it's not so so strong that it like
gives you a headache but it's a very
nice pleasant like wakeup kind of scent
is what it reminds me of it's it's very
nice a little bit orange E if I had to
pick I'm gonna use these all the way up
these are mostly gone I'm gonna finish
using them but if I were gonna purchase
something from the line it would
definitely be the toner I don't think I
would purchase anything else for number
three this month I've actually had this
for quite a while but I haven't
mentioned it to you I don't think in a
video before this is the benefit 24-hour
brow setter they set me a bunch of
products I was thinking about doing like
a whole benefit brow video because I
have so many brow products and now at
this point I've tried them for such a
long period of time I have a really
strong viewpoint on all of the benefit
brow products that I've tried I think
there's only like one that I haven't
tried and that's like they're really
skinny pencil but this I'm really like I
really like the the brush on it it's
like a flat brush I don't know if you
can see that but it's got the like the
bristles on this side and this side and
then it's flat in the middle like it's
like a paddle but with like mascara
bristles on either side and what I
really love about this that I like so
much better than the Anastasio one if we
were comparing is number one it doesn't
have a strong alcohol scent and number
two it doesn't make my brows crunchy yet
it holds them in place so that oh my
gosh it's like ideal it's an absolutely
ideal brow gel for me for holding my
eyebrows in place I've never had a
problem with my brows moving later on in
the day my biggest problem is I just
have to remember to use it cuz I always
forget to use a brow gel but when I use
this I am so so happy so this is
definitely a recommend speaking of brows
oh my gosh
found a new brow pomade really excited
about this this is the Crisanta and
cosmetics new brow pomade CRA's Anna
Anna is a friend of the channel she
sends me stuff for PR when she comes out
with new products all the time this is
the one that I feel like she is just
knocked out of the park it reminds me a
lot of the anastasia dipbrow but it is
much less expensive if you like
instagram brows this is the product for
you if you like those really opaque
sharp brows now if you don't like
instagram brows but you still like a lot
of pigment you can easily spoil you this
product out the other thing i really
like about this is that it stays put it
doesn't end up traveling where i've
tried some brow gels that by the end of
the day I've got like brown like coming
down here and I just look really really
sad because I've got way too much brow
product and it's like travel it all the
way down but this does not do that it
sets very very nicely but it is very
intense so keep that in mind
if you don't like
more thick brow products you don't want
to get this but I personally really
really love it and finally at number one
big shocker for me I didn't expect this
to ever make it she's number one but I'm
actually really really liking this and I
have to go with my heart and I have to
tell you by number one product for this
month is the Too Faced chocolate gold
palette I've really been loving this
when i swatched this I wasn't that
impressed it didn't seem to be as
metallic as I wanted it to be I did a
live stream I actually ended up private
in that live stream because I feel like
it didn't give accurate information to
what I ended up thinking once I tried
the products that I showed in that video
so that video you can't find on my
channel anymore I don't like to keep
things like that up even though I was
very clear in the video it was a first
impression I don't want anybody to think
that that is the way that it applied on
the eyes this stuff applies on the eyes
really really really well and I'm just
I'm loving it every shade I've used in
here I've enjoyed using it makes me
happy I don't know about you but like
when I use an eyeshadow palette it
either brings me joy or it doesn't and
this is a palette that brings me joy and
part of it might be the chocolate scent
because I like chocolate and I love the
chocolate sense but I feel like this I
have to say is my favorite Too Faced
eyes shadow palette right now I have so
many Too Faced eyeshadow palettes you
know you know the original one the
bonbons the peach the peanut butter and
jelly I've got the candy Johnson palette
that I actually really liked but I think
this one is gonna top it for me the only
people I think that would not like this
for people they just don't like bold
looks which is not me I really like like
the bold shiny eyelid look so if that's
not you I don't think you're gonna like
this one another thing I want to mention
that I really appreciate about this is I
really like this little corner of matte
here I think that was really very very
smart of them I wish they did that more
in their palettes I think that's really
cool of them to include this here I feel
like it really balances out the rest of
the palette so you can have you've kind
of set down this base here and then just
have fun with the rest of the palette
pairing the colors in different ways I
haven't found any combinations within
this palette that I don't enjoy where
I'm like oh those colors don't go
together they all seem to be going
together really really nicely and I'm so
thankful that I decided
pick this pallet up one day when I find
absolutely hilarious about this that I
was gonna mention if I did a full review
of it I asked on Twitter if I should do
a full review this and pretty much
everybody was like now I'm over it is
the fact that this looks so much like
the makeup revolution eyeshadow palettes
because if you don't know makeup
revolution has been kind of duping Too
Faced palettes for a long time and
they've got this chocolate bar I'll put
a picture here the chocolate bar with
like their drips down the side to face
totally ripped their chocolate bar with
the drips down the side it's almost like
a you you know giving a special finger
to make a design like this like we're
gonna do your design but we're gonna
make it look at ten times cooler than
you ever have kind of thing I don't know
I found it a little bit funny but anyway
point is is that I really really do
enjoy this palette and if you do like
shimmery metallicky foil the kind of
eyeshadows I definitely recommend
checking this out and picking it up so
that is it for my monthly favorites and
