double as my honeymoon suitcase hello my
friends welcome to my slightly belated
January favorites video well it's not
favorites video it's a favorites in
fails video basically what I do is I
line up ten products that I used and
line them up from very very bad to very
very good we start at number ten which
is what we're gonna do right now at
number ten this month my biggest biggest
fail this month was a big shocker to me
like I when I got this in my view delish
lucky bag I was so stinking excited it's
like yes it was something I wanted for a
really long time I was so happy about it
and I am seriously crying in my heart
over this and this is the Becca ombre
Rouge palette
now let me say some positives here I did
swatch this on my hand for you the
swatches come out very very nice they're
very creamy very buttery shadows here's
the issue number one they muddy together
on the eyes the shades do not have
enough contrast in order to make a look
that does not muddy it just they've all
mushed together the second issue I have
with it is that it doesn't have a good
lasting power by the end of the day
these are gone off my eyes and to me for
a palette of this price that's
absolutely unacceptable so I would
definitely not recommend this palette I
would be hesitant to buy Becca eye
shadows in the future and that makes me
sad it makes me really sad I would have
to see some really good reviews on about
a shadow palette for me to invest in
another one in the future I'm I'm crying
in my heart because I love that guy and
this makes me sad at number nine this
month is a product that I actually
returned because I just couldn't wait
any longer I had I had an opportunity to
go to Sephora and I was like you know
what I'm just going to take the stuff
back and just be done with it
and they wear the Kat Von D shade +
light blush duos I bought them and
before I got them in the mail I saw
Thames Holly I gave them an F and if you
don't know tempt Holly on her blog she
is probably the number one you need
blogger of all time her blog is amazing
and she scores everything and for exempt
Holly to give something at F it has to
be pretty bad like it has to be really
bad and it's bad it's really bad the
pigmentation on these things is is
atrocious
I had Mickey and Mallory that one was
really was was terrible the 150 often
Poe was a little bit better and if it
weren't for the price point I probably
would have kept Piaf in Poe it kind of
reminds me of a mediocre drugstore blush
something where you would be like yeah I
paid 6 bucks for it
I like it it's nice you know wear it
every once in a while you know it's fine
but not for $25 the lasting power was
not good and it just was a horrible
formula and now why I'm crying
especially about this is because her old
blush formula was my Holy Grail blush
formula the one that she discontinued
I'm so sad that it's gone and has been
replaced with this terribleness on the
other side one of my friends here on
YouTube mentioned to me that they are
now off of the sephora website maybe
they were getting such terrible reviews
that they just took them down hopefully
they're reformulating them and working
through them again because I don't even
I don't even know what they were
thinking when they put them out on the
market whether that people were gonna
think that this was gonna be okay I mean
they're absolutely horrible I did hear
that there were a couple of them that
were a little bit better some of the
deeper shades were a little bit better
but mmm not good not good at all at
number eight this month is the essence
liquid eyeliner now I do want to show
you the essence gel liner this one is
wonderful and I'm a huge essence fan I
did not like the liquid liner and I'll
tell you the big reason why I didn't
like it and it's because of the brush
okay if you can see there it's it seems
like it's kind of a fine point but when
you put it on the eye see how thick that
is it's really difficult to get it to be
fine it's just too difficult to work
with so when I use this on my eye I
can't get a wing I can put it all over
the lid but it does seep into my fine
lines so it takes some working with so
even for the price I wouldn't recommend
this just because of how difficult it is
to work with unless you like a really
thick line if you like a really thick
line you'll probably love it I
personally don't like it at all
lasting power is still pretty good but
it's just that brush man the brush kills
that they should have made it just a
little bit more fine pointed and it
would have been a great product number
seven starts getting into kind of the
man products for me this is the artist
Couture by angel his name is Mac Daddy
on YouTube it is his highlighters and
feel like this is more of a personal
preference thing overall it comes like
this it comes with four mineral style
pops here they're called diamond glow
powder and let me just say the packaging
is super cute here it's this cute little
box with this little bow ribbon and it's
just it's adorable packaging my issue
with these highlighters is they are not
targeted I don't think two people who do
not go clubbing they have a lot of
glitter they're targeted I believe
toward the Instagram crowd people that
really want a glitter highlight glitter
okay so here are the four swatches one
two three and four and you can see the
sparkle in them this one is probably the
most matte but there's definitely
sparkle in there as well and it's not
just shimmer
it's sparkle the top one is called
conceited the second is called yes the
third is called mermaid fantasy and then
the fourth is called Illuminati so along
with them being straight-up Sparkle they
don't last on the face they're a powder
that just if you get on a strong wind
they're gone I mean within two hours
they're completely gone off the face so
this is why I'm saying I feel like this
is marketed and should be for people who
are taking photographs for Instagram or
if you're taking photographs for a
wedding and you want glitter on your
cheeks you want that fairy look I feel
like this is not for the everyday person
in just the sparkle of it and the
lasting power they're just not good for
that so there is a market for them it's
just oh I'd be curious to know how these
would work on the eyes I feel like they
might be nice eyes shadow rather than
highlighters but I haven't tried them
for that purpose so I can't review them
for that purpose but maybe a little bit
of fix plus or something and then
patting them onto the eyes maybe
gorgeous alright number six the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi cushion now this I did
do a review of and comparison with the
Physicians Formula one I would say that
overall in the end I feel like now that
I figured out how I can best work this I
like this one better than the Physicians
Formula I do still feel like the
Physicians Formula lasts a bit longer
but when I've used this with my Real
Techniques sponge instead of the sponge
that is included in here the lasting
power is much better the finish is much
better and it's a much nicer product to
use overall when I specifically use my
Real Techniques sponge you can use a
beauty blender as well this sponge I
don't care for I don't feel like it's
effective as far as getting the look
that I want to get now the other thing
is is this is ridiculously overpriced
you get half as much product as a
traditional foundation I don't feel like
it's worth that price difference so if
it's something that you're curious about
I recommend trying it but just know that
you're getting half the product for
twice the price and it may not be worth
it to you okay number five is a perfect
place to put this because it's actually
a skin care kit now this is the way it
looks when it's actually in the bag this
is by skin Iceland and it is the saving
face recovery kit for life's biggest
moments and it says big interview and
breakout coming on when week before my
wedding five hours of sleep in five days
my under eye bags are so big they could
double as my honeymoon suitcase this is
a $50 bag I got it at Ulta at full price
and then I saw them on the epsy website
as an FC deal for $20 so I got a second
one the reason why I got a second one is
because there's certain things in here
that I'm really really enjoying and
would purchase a full size of so let's
just kind of go through the different
products so the first thing in here is
the Nordic skin peel this is supposed to
be an exfoliator and it comes with all
of these pads now altogether I mean this
is an insane deal if you like these
products it's in the same deal to get it
for 50 bucks for 20 it's even more
ridiculous these are very very cold and
that comes with most of these skin
iceland they're going with the ice theme
on this you know that clean feeling you
feel in the teeth if you use a really
really crisp toothpaste that's the way
your skin feels when you use this and
that's how I'm appealing to you you'll
probably love these products it's very
wet it's very saturated with product I
use this about three times a week they
say you could use it daily if you don't
have sensitive skin but you get this
entire full-size pack of it it's 60 pads
and I feel like they're they're very
good to use I don't know what they're
actually doing anything but they feel
awfully good and they're rough enough
that I
like they could exfoliating so I'm just
trusting and it's working but I have no
evidence to show that this one's working
next is the cleanser this is the Glacial
face wash again you're gonna end up with
that cold feeling on your face after you
use it if you like lather on your
skincare and this is going to be great
for you it's very enjoyable to use of
course this is not a full-size I don't
feel like it fully removes my makeup I
remove my makeup first then I use this
as a cleanser afterward works great for
that but this is not a makeup remover
just so you know but I do feel like it
works as a nice second pass over my face
after I've removed my makeup now this is
where we get into the stuff that I think
makes it worth it
this is the skin Iceland Icelandic
relief I pen this year and I'm gonna
open this up because this is kind of the
reason why I wanted to try this this
more from this brand are these skin skin
ice and hydro cool firming eye gels
these I I hate Maps
I hate face masks but I love these they
are sticky and they're cold and they
feel really good under the eyes they're
great for deep puffing they're great for
under-eye bags I feel like my I have a
crease right here that is just an aging
kind of dig that my eyes kind of sink in
a little bit I feel like that
significantly diminished since I've been
using both of these the first time I
used one of these I was like oh oh my
goodness like I was so excited I feel
like the effects of this wear off after
24 hours though I don't feel like they
last same thing with this if I put this
on at night when I wake up in the
morning I feel like my under eyes are
more taut but then throughout the day
they kind of go back to looking normal
so this is definitely something you have
to keep using and order for it to work
but I feel like it's doing good things
for my eyes and my wrinkles and the
tartness of my skin I feel just doing
great things so these are kind of the
two products out of all of them that I
really love really love that really make
this purchase worth it for me so just
between just this is $20 alone so and
then the last thing in here is the
moisturizer I don't like this
moisturizer this is it's called the
antidote cooling day lotion again you
get that cold feeling on your face and I
don't feel like it truly moisturizes
when I put it on my skin my skin will
sometimes still feel dry and to me after
moisturizing that's completely
unacceptable so this is something that I
wouldn't recommend do you see I've used
almost all of it
and I will continue to use it but I
won't purchase this again this is
something that I just I don't think it's
good so definitely some wins and some
fails in that kit so that's why it's a
great place at number five at number
four this month we have the Revlon
Colorstay not just nudes palettes I have
this one in the passion nudes I also
have number two in the romantic nudes
this is a huge jump for Revlon Revlon
eyeshadows are notoriously terrible I
mean I have every time I've ever said
okay I'm just gonna give these one more
shot for Revlon eyeshadows I've always
regretted it every time this is the
exception the L'Oreal Allah palettes
were my favorite of the drugstore
palettes that came out was it maybe six
months ago or whatever there was a huge
push on drugstore palettes the L'Oreal
Appel it's worth more than my favourites
I feel like this is definitely up there
if not better I love that you get some
shimmery shades some matte shades some
satin shades in here the thing that
really sells me on these is the lasting
power is fantastic and I am shocked by
that even without a primer the lasting
power in these shadows is wonderful so
that's really where this gets me they
are a little more difficult to work with
than the high-end shadows that I have
but they're not so difficult to work
with that it's not worth the price point
especially if you're in the market for a
new nude palette this one and the
romantic nudes just beautiful beautiful
palettes definitely recommend them and
and I'm very much enjoying using them I
love the shade range the shade range is
perfect
for lots of different skin tones and
they really knocked it out of the park
with this good job Revlon I am very
proud of you on this one at number three
this actually was number one in my heart
for a while and it dropped to number
three today and this is the blink
mascara amplified it is a tubing mascara
I've got it in my boxycharm and if you
saw my boxycharm review you've already
seen what I'm gonna say about this
except for the very end so what this is
is it's a very large brush you put on
your mascara like normal but what
happens at the end of the day is that
when you take it off you take it off
with just warm water and the tubes just
slide off of your lashes so there's no
rubbing and that is what makes this
stuff magical now the reason why it
dropped down from number one
number three is that I feel like as its
aging the effects of the love the
lengthening and the volumizing is not as
good and I've only had this open for
about a month three weeks three weeks
probably and I feel like it's already
starting to die a little bit on me which
makes me super sad because this was all
of a sudden a Holy Grail status mascara
out of nowhere and now it's starting to
die on me and I'm just like are you
kidding me I what I would recommend if
you wanted to try this is if you can get
your hands on a deluxe sized sample for
cheaper then I would recommend this at
this point I'm not recommending getting
a full size just because of its it's not
aging well and it just breaks my heart
but it did introduce me to tubing
mascaras so that is bumping it up on my
list for this month and I did love it
for those first three weeks I mean just
I didn't want to use anything else
because of the not needing to rub my
eyes to get my makeup off is just a
whole nother world for me it's a
complete game-changer so that's why it's
at number three this month at number two
this month is a complete tie I could not
decide because I love them for different
reasons to brow products that I did a
reveal review of that I will link
there's a little eye that you'll see up
in the corner go ahead and click that
and that will take you to the video
where I review these now or you can
click the link down below after the
video is over now this is the Maybelline
brow drama crayon pomade and then this
is the Loreal brow stylist definer this
one here let's talk about this one this
one is just as good as my Anastasio brow
is it is very thin it goes on creamy
it's got the spoolie on the back again
full review down below or click the eye
and then this one here is the this one's
a crayon form now this one I got a lot
of comments on that video about using
this and what happens when the point
goes down because this is not one that
you can sharpen it does roll up that
much what you're gonna do when this
starts to die is you're gonna take a
breath a brow brush and you're gonna rub
it in the product and you're gonna rub
it on your eye and it's gonna work just
as well and I have used it that way and
it does work just as well overall I
would recommend this one over this one
just because of the value but if you
like that skinniness and you like this
format better I definitely recommend
this they're both ten bucks
either way I
you're gonna like it as far as the
formula it's really just how you like it
presented better and whether you like
getting a lot more product for your
money and the number one product this
month is a product I've actually had for
a couple of months but I've never
mentioned it and I think that it
deserves the number one spot this month
and it is the BH Cosmetics Carli bybel
palette I am not subscribed to Carli
bybel I don't think I've ever watched a
single one of her videos i I just I just
haven't jumped on the Carli bybel video
training yet but I will tell you that
this palette is phenomenal absolutely
phenomenal and it's only 1250 on the BH
Cosmetics website right now and this is
all this is not sponsored I was not sent
this for a review this is I purchased
this with my own money like all of this
there isn't a single thing here that was
sent to me except for that this came in
my my box e-tron which I do get for
review but other than that I've paid for
every single thing here with my own
money now this here the pigmentation on
these things is amazing the lasting
power is amazing my only critique of
this is I wish there were just a few
more matte shades like a matte taupe
would make me so happy this is the
closest we have to a matte taupe and
it's just a little bit too dark if they
took this knocked it down a notch and
replace one of these shades with it we
would be in serious business serious
business these highlighters are gorgeous
they're also gorgeous as eyeshadows this
is an amazing amazingly high-quality
collet I would compare this to my high
and I shadows I would compare this to my
urban decay I would compare it to my Too
Faced I would compare it to all of those
this is amazing I do recommend that you
check out they do have a brand new BH
Cosmetics palette that is supposed to be
just as the same quality as this my
friend Michelle from glam moms just
reviewed it it's pride plus Prejudice
plush zombies or Pride and Prejudice and
Zombies palette I will link her video
down below if you want to see swatches
of that palette but she says that it's
the same quality as this so good for you
