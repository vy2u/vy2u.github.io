about 10 o'clock at night and I just got
home from running holiday errands and
picking up my daughter who's spending
the night in my parents house and I came
home to this giant like tower of boxes
of stuff that I bought and one of the
things that I wanted to show you and I
could not wait was this jewel matte box
it is my first order from jewel mint on
Black Friday they had an email go out
they said $25 for five jewelry pieces
and I was like oh I've always wanted to
order from jewel man and I've never
known what to get this would be the
perfect way for me to kind of introduce
myself to jewel men and get like a
subscription box kind of thing at the
same time because it's all surprise
stuff now they had said that some of the
boxes include up to 20 pieces of jewelry
some of them have other surprise things
in them why we just couldn't resist
getting this I wanted to open on camera
so that I could show you what I got
supposedly most of the boxes are
different so we shall see all I did was
cut the tape and it's got packaging
slips and stuff like that and the first
thing I see is a special thank you we
hope you thoroughly enjoy your new mint
find as a special thank you take 25% off
your next full price to purchase so
there we go and then my packing slip red
paper and let's see we got well I am
seeing some little bags here I'm also
seeing a box so this is everything
that's in it obviously I did not get 20
pieces of jewelry home curious to know
what you all think of what I got as well
so make sure you leave that information
in the comments below what you think
okay let's say what is this oh that's
interesting that's a little edgy I don't
think that matches my outfit right now
noop does not match my outfit but that's
interesting I I don't know if I can rock
this or not this might become a
Christmas gift I don't know do you guys
think I can rock this bracelet I don't
know about that okay let's see what's
next another bracelet whoa another crazy
bracelet I don't know about this one
either not really my style
I don't know maybe oh okay so that's two
pieces down okay I'm going to open up
the other bag assuming there's two other
pieces in here
let's see another bracelet okay this
one's really cool I like this one a lot
purple is my favorite color like some
diamond ish kind of stones and then two
purple stones this one's actually really
cool I actually really like this one how
does it open it's got a hinge aha it
still doesn't match my outfit ah okay I
like this one a lot this one is a win
for me so hopefully whatever's in this
box will make up for the rest of the $25
okay I only got three pieces so far and
they said it's gonna clear least five
pieces so there should be two pieces in
here okay there's still four pieces in
here Wow okay so I got four necklaces in
here can check those out so this one
here it looks like it's just got some
stones going across and it's got kind of
a brassy color chain to it this one says
dream and it's on kind of a black chain
but it looks very very cheaply made like
the M is a strange font I don't know I'm
not sure if I will wear that one this
little bow one is super super cute I
love that one and then there's a little
feather one down here that I love oh
wait no this is you know what I think
this one is one necklace let me open
this up just to see okay there are three
so let me take these off so we can
really see what's happening here okay
this one is definitely my favorite okay
you've got the bow at the top and then
the leaf at the bottom this one is
gorgeous
I will definitely rock this one this one
I will definitely wear as well this
one's very pretty
again look it's just look at that look
at this can you guys see that I'm not
sure if you can see that but the stones
are like put in crooked so like this
one's in crooked and this one looks like
it's set in further or something like
this one's not in perfectly oh very very
cheaply made not
really happy with how that looks but I
will probably wear it anyway just
because I don't think most people will
notice unless they're looking very
closely I don't know do you think people
will notice I don't know mmm now that I
look at it I don't know I'll try to rock
it and then I'll ask my honest friends
if they think they can tell them how
cheaply it's made and then this one I
don't know if I'm gonna wear this one
this one here it says dream I really
like the idea of it I just don't like
the font that they used the M is smaller
than the rest of the letters and I think
that's gonna bug me so it looks like
it's the biggest with the D and then it
gets smaller as it goes to the end I
don't know I wish they were all similar
you know similar sizes I don't know I
guess that's just a personal preference
but the stones look like they're in
there at least but yeah I mean I think
overall I will wear $25 worth of jewelry
out of here so the big wins in here work
for me wear this bracelet and this
necklace this one is a maybe this one I
don't know this one's a maybe and these
bracelets are big nose for me well not
where these will have to pass these on
to a friend well thank you so much for
watching I hope that you found that fun
and interesting to watch me unbox this
