julep box mystery box opening I am
always up for surprises in the mail and
when they come from a company like julep
it makes me even happier I own quite a
few julep polishes I am embarrassed to
admit how many I own I am NOT going to
tell you because it's ridiculous but I
had a subscription for a little over a
year now and you get two to three
polishes a month you can kind of add
that up plus I went a little nuts um one
of their sales and ordered like ten
polishes they were only like three bucks
apiece it was crazy when a little crazy
so this is just adding to the madness
that is my jewel collection now this is
the thing about julep that I'm learning
julep comes up with some beautiful
gorgeous colors the colors are just so
creative and amazing of course some of
them are very ordinary of course but
some of the colors are just beautiful so
that's why I continue to get julep now
as far as being chip resistant I had
really bad luck with julep nail polishes
and being chip resistant usually they
chip on me after about a day to two days
they are not chip resistant at all at
least for the way that I treat my nails
now as you can see I don't have my nails
painted because I was hoping to be able
to try on some of these polishes for you
so you can see what they look like we
can figure out you know what kind of
coats we're dealing with here let's go
ahead and get into what was in this box
and if you are not familiar with the
julep subscription and the subscription
itself is $20 a month you get two to
three polishes a mug PI star that's my
caddy your first month is actually free
that's really cool that's how you hooked
me and why I'm so addicted at this point
but if you want to try a free box I'll
put my referral link down below
everybody that has julep has a referral
link I do pay for all of my chillip
stuff out right it is not sent to me
they don't even know that I make videos
I don't think so let me just show you I
will put
I paid for this right here I did end up
getting I think two lucky bucks on him
remember I better look it up just so I
can see what in the world I order what I
ordered was the lucky mixture mystery
box I got to pick which mystery box she
wanted and you can see one of the
polishes you were getting I picked the
one with Shannon and it was $25 and then
when I went to go check out they had
some add-ons because they always do and
they one called Nicolette which is a
white and I do have a white polish buy
them but it's a matte white and I wanted
a white that wasn't Matt even though I
love the matte white I wanted another
one so I got that and then they had
another mystery box add-on for another
10 bucks let's say so this is Nicolette
they now come in these these packages
here instead of bubble wrap and I like
that okay these are the three colors I
believe this was the $10 add-on because
you didn't know what color to forget you
didn't get choice they just said for 10
bucks we'll send you three polishes so I
got Lexie Cassie and Amy and I'll put
the descriptions here for those three
polishes and I will show you the
swatches and then this was the original
$25 mystery box and in here I got some
forget-me-not seeds and it looks like
they put in some forget-me-not seeds for
with the other mystery box as well we
did get some forget-me-not seeds last
spring I believe so these are probably
sage pledges had extras and it looks
like I got six polishes and then also a
glycolic hand scrub with natural apricot
seeds this facial for hands packs a 10%
glycolic acid punch whisk away dirt and
oil to reveal noticeably softer and
younger looking hands after just one use
so let's say so this is what it looks
like the two I want to smell it because
I said it's it's supposedly it smells
really good it smells like lotion or so
and it definitely has like an
exfoliating like little beads in their
resume this is you can see so that's the
way that looks and I can feel the
crunchies already but it's I mean it
does smell nice it's just not you know
oh my gosh it smells amazing you know
I'm saying I'm gonna go wash this off
I'll be right back okay so let's get
into the polishes I got in that $25
am I like pink my extra pink all of a
sudden or something I don't know and the
first thing I'm seeing is one called
Sabrina and it is a crackle polish and
so my knowledge crackle polishes are
kind of out I'm seeing them all on
discount right now which mm and it's an
orange so I'm not really happy about
getting this one it did come with it
looks like it's like a purpley black
called fee or a and then this one I
think I have this one this one I do have
this one it's Blakely this is actually
my favorite julep polish and now I have
a backup with you okay I love Blakely it
is gorgeous I'm gonna show you the
swatch just gorgeous
oh so excited to have that one I wear
that I live in the Baltimore area and I
wear Blakely during Ravens season and
everybody goes nuts at least when the
Ravens are doing well nobody cared last
year so and then it came with three more
let's see what's in here I see a pretty
one and I see one I'm not too crazy
about okay this one I don't know so I'm
kind of on the fence about it's called
Kennedy it's a very nudie nudie I don't
think I have any colors like this so
it'll be nice to have something of this
tone because I don't think I own
anything like that and then this one's
really pretty this one's like a mint
green and what's the color here this one
is called Shannon and it's a silk finish
I love their sub finishes this one is
going to be gorgeous I can already tell
and then this one here is the one I'm
not too sure about this one is it looks
like it's a gold brass kind of color and
it's called Tatiana and it does look
like a Latin kind of color reminds me of
like a Midwestern kind of you know
southern Texas II kind of color I don't
know just reminds me of desert so yeah
so those are all of the polishes that I
got I'm excited to try them and enjoy
them and add them to my julep collection
I just wanted to give you a little bit
of my impressions after I have swatched
them all kind of giving you my you know
my thoughts on them so as far as
Nicolette goes it's exactly what I was
looking for it is a you know semi glossy
but not too glossy white polish the two
coats were beautiful and really happy
with Nicolette now this one is actually
not as bad as I thought it was gonna be
the Sabrina I don't see the crackle
maybe because they did not apply it over
top of another polish but all I see is
like a I don't know like I'm it's really
a matte finish and it's got like a shine
to it it's weird it's it's a hard to
explain it's not glossy but there's like
a little bit of like a shine that almost
changes the color a little and you can
see like I don't know if you saw over
here as I was brushing the second coat
on the second coat actually pull a
little bit of the polish off and it
actually been about an hour between
coats so there's no reason for there to
have been damage to the Polish after
that so not very happy with that overall
I probably won't be using this one that
often the Sabrina but it may be nice for
fall maybe Halloween something like that
so I am gonna keep it but it's
definitely probably my least favorite
out of this set alright moving on to
Fiore it is a really dark dark color
it's it's darker than polishes that I
normally wear I can see this is maybe a
nice base for some nail art I can't see
me wearing just this straight it's just
not my style to wear something that's
that close to black just plain so it
might be nice for nail art but this one
I probably won't reach for a whole lot
either but you can see that it was very
opaque in those two coats and extremely
extremely glossy so really interesting
color there now this one here this was
this is Cassie and I actually like this
one better than I thought I would as far
as the shade now this one was not
completely opaque within the two coats I
would probably put a third coat on this
for good measure but overall I do really
think I'm going to be using this polish
it's a beautiful spring color I am very
happy with it as far as the initial
application I just think that it's a
three coat polish and usually juleps are
either one or two coat polish all right
now
to Blakeley now this one I don't know
why but I don't I remember Blakeley
being a little more purple than this I
haven't worn it in a while but it's a
little more I mean it's it's a multi
chrome I don't know how you call it it's
not a duochrome because there's multiple
colors in there but I don't know I don't
love it as much as I did when I remember
applying this a couple of years ago when
the Ravens were doing so well in the
Super Bowl I seemed more green and then
I remember and less purple so I don't
know I just don't really like it it's an
extremely unique color but it's
definitely not my favorite anymore you
know opinions change over time moving on
to Amy I know I have quite a few julep
polishes that are very similar to Amy
but I really think this is a beautiful
color yeah it is fully opaque within two
coats it is a really pretty for spring
color and even into summer it'll be nice
for nail art it's not super glossy it is
a little it looks a little deeper on the
nail than it does in the bottle I don't
know if you're seeing that but that's
what I'm kind of picking up here but I
do enjoy the way that this applies it's
not streaky would recommend Amy
all right now Lexi Lexi is not I mean
neon you know yellow is not a color I
typically wear all over my nails but it
will be nice for a nail art maybe laying
a polish over top of it you know as far
as you know using a striper or dotting
tool or something to put something over
top and you'll see this one as well was
is not a two coat polish it's gonna be
more of a three coat polish and I know
that this is an applied super cleanly
remember I'm not a nail artist here I'm
just a consumer just like folks the
people probably watching this so please
don't pick on my polish application you
know I'm just I'm just you know I'm
trying to got the camera on the way and
everything but you know this this really
it's it's not my favorite color to use
as far as you know just being a bright
yellow but I can see it being usable
it'll be fine
it's just it's it's not a very wearable
color for me all right three colors left
this one in Kennedy I actually like this
a lot more than I thought I would the
nudie cream color it's gonna be really
pretty as a base for some nail art I
don't know I keep talking about nail art
but I can't I mean just the nudie color
I think it looks a little bit weird on
my skin tone I
now what do y'all think III don't know
it just it's not really my taste to wear
this by itself but you know I think we
can work with it I can do something with
it I am happy to have and I don't have
any colors like this so it takes me out
of my comfort zone so I am happy to have
it it's just I don't know I'm a little I
don't know about the shade I don't know
if it's really me you know it doesn't
really fit my personality but definitely
happy to have it and it was a two coat
polish which I'm surprised for how
lightly for how light the color the
shade is it is a two coat polish so very
happy about that aspect now this one
here this one is the shannon color and
i'm actually this is the one that I'm
actually happiest with of all the shades
that I applied today well there's two of
them these last two actually are my
favorites Shannon is just beautiful this
matte silk finish I just love the way
that that looks I think it's so super
pretty I wish I had had this for Saint
Patrick's Day but I think this will be a
really pretty color for spring just in
general I can see me wearing that all
over my nails without any nail art I
think this is a very wearable color for
me I'm really really happy with it and
then this was kind of the shocker for me
you know I really didn't think that I
was going to enjoy Tatiana but it's
absolutely stinking gorgeous this is
gonna be a beautiful fall color I can
see wearing this the Thanksgiving dinner
I can see wearing this for you know
right around you know when the leaves
starting to start to change I mean it's
a gorgeous gorgeous fall color I'm
really really happy with this one and
I'm absolutely shocked at how much I
love this polish so so that was my lucky
box unboxing I hope that you enjoyed
