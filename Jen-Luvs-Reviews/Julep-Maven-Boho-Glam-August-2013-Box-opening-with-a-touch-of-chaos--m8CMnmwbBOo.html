here alright so this video is quickly my
julep unboxing all I did was under the
packaging I have it opened it yet the
kids really want to be on this you like
Lila's cute hair but a thumbs up if you
like light lest you care oh my goodness
forget-me-not seeds as our little bonus
extra little thing they threw in here
and Fernet forget-me-nots really pretty
so you're very distracting so it says
refer to friends to get two thousand
joules which is enough for a free box so
if you're interested and so if I refer
to friends that you get two thousand
joules which is a free box so if you're
interested in that I would put my julep
link down below so let's see what's in
here first we get the double step is it
foot foot treatment and friction stick
I'm assuming this is for when you have
shoes that you got all right John was
being a little crazy so now it's just me
and Lila he's out playing in his room
for a little while but anyway as I was
saying this is the double step foot
treatment and friction stick so this is
for when your shoes are bugging you and
you need something to kind of make a
guard usually I just put band-aids on
the feet and actually a subscriber of
mine it will put their name here mention
to me that band-aid makes a friction
stick and i actually just bought it and
i haven't used it yet and then of course
i get this this is actually pretty
neat-looking the packaging is cool okay
so i will put this away and put this to
good use got a little roll up thing is
my talk on here so i'm going to go ahead
and roll that down and if it's awesome
it will definitely be in a favorites
video okay now on to my polishes they
came wrapped it really pretty this month
really really pretty that is your le le
yeah hmm not so sure about these
polishes this one I'm not real sure
about this one is Frances and it is like
a muddy green kind of love that ugly
yeah a little bit and yeah I'm not sure
about this one this one is called Louis
yeah I like this one I think this one's
definitely usable with offer fall or for
spring all right here you go let's watch
it on Lila's fingers first watch on a
five-year-old it is really pretty it's
very elegant he's actually go pretty
together that is actually a lot prettier
than I thought it was going to be so
those are the swatches on Lila's fingers
if you can see those this one they
actually look really pretty together I'm
shocked at how much I like this green
especially paired with the the pinky
mavi color just really really pretty i'm
excited about them so overall I'm
actually really happy with this because
I never would have picked up this color
in the store there's just no way like I
look at it and go view that's just ugly
but swatch on her fingers it's actually
very very pretty so it's almost like a
rose with a rose stem kind of feeling
here it almost reminds me of my grandma
believe it or not my grandma would have
loved these colors so i'm sure i will be
happy with them and enjoy them back at
you my stinky breath achoo right so
overall i feel like i'm very happy with
this for twenty bucks i got my two julep
polishes which I think are like fourteen
dollars or something ridiculous in the
store each but then cheaper of course
when you order them i got my dub step
double step not Doug stat that's a kind
of music I got my two polishes I got my
double step and I got my forget-me-not
seeds that we will be planting you want
