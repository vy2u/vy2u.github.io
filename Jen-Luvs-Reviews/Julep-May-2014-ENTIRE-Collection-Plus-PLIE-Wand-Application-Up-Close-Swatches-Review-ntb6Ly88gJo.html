the make election from jülich so this
these are my Museum of thoughts here
okay so this one as far as application
this one is called Jean and this one
actually had a gorgeous application one
coat no streaks no clumps amazing this
one here is Tam and kam is a beautiful
color in my opinion I really really like
it a lot it did take two coats to become
opaque it might even need a third coat
depending on how you choose to apply it
but really liked that one as well
this one here is called Iona and this
one I felt with really took three coats
to become opaque but now that it is
opaque it is really beautiful and I do
enjoy it a lot this one here is called
jewels and I felt like this one was one
of the streaky ones this one took it's
three coats there and might even be able
to use a fourth coat I mean just not
super opaque at all I don't I don't know
the description so no it's meant to be
that way or what but definitely not my
favorite as far as application but the
color really is pretty once you get into
a page this one is called Maddie and
Maddie was gorgeous after one to two
coats really pretty it's not quite as
pretty as I thought it was going to be
when I saw it on the website but it is
very pretty and it's a really nice
summer color this here is called
Paulette and Paulette was beautiful
after the two coats just really pretty I
love the gold shifts and they're just
really beautiful I really love that one
that one wasn't streaky at all this one
also was very beautiful this one is
called Larry or Lori and this one is
just absolutely beautiful I think this
one is actually my favorite of all of
them this one's going to be beautiful
for spring and summer I can see myself
wearing the summit toes I could see
myself wearing this on my nails I'm just
really excited about this this one here
was my least favorite of the bunch this
one is called Ramona went on very streak
three coats two opacity of a little bit
clumpy definitely not a fan of the
formula of this one and then lastly we
have Seiya
se
I believe is how you pronounce that and
this one's really beautiful if you like
orange or coral polishes it does have
some gold there in the background and
it's just a beautiful color I did take
two coats to be opaque but it really
truly looks like that on the nail which
I absolutely love so now a little bit
about this plie wand I don't know about
this yet I'm not sure I mean as you saw
in the application it you do have to it
took me a minute to figure out how to
get these things off and these were
actually kind of difficult to pull off
it really took some some muscle to get
those off at least for me and but the
but you know putting it on was very easy
the the thing about this is it's
supposed to give you more control over
doing your polish with your left hand
now I can just do my polish with my left
hand I've been able to do that for quite
a long time so I don't know if I really
personally need a tool like this because
I'm used to doing it with a shorter tool
I feel like the downfall of this is just
how long this wand is I feel like it's
just too long if they really wanted to
make it for what it's supposed to be
they should have chopped off about an
inch of this wand and I think it would
have been easier to use I feel like the
counterbalance here isn't a good thing
but if you are really bad at doing nail
polish on your non-dominant hand then
you know using your non-dominant hand
painting then then this may be something
you might want to try I did feel like
this rest here did give me more control
it was really nice to have this rest
here do I feel like this is gonna be the
cure for nail polish application issues
no I don't think it's going to be but it
is a nice tool so this here is what it
says it's supposed to come with and I
didn't get these things I don't know I
thought this piece I got two of those I
got one of those I did not get that and
I did not get that so I'm gonna have to
contact julep and find out what is up
with that I think this is just supposed
to be a regular nail polish brush but it
is a bit harder than other brushes than
their natural brush it feels just and
feels very plasticky and super cheap you
do have to dip it in nail polish remover
in order to get it to fall
that's what made it a little bit softer
but I mean you can see after using it
one time how filthy it has become so I
you know I'm not a fan of this design
for these I'm hoping that the striper
will be a little bit better you know I
mean I think the idea of the plie wand
is cool I think that it's it's a good
idea I think it's worth trying if you do
want you know a new way to try on your
polish if you have trouble with polish
application this may be something you
might want to try so that is my review
of the julep collection for May I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up and make
sure you subscribe if you would like to
see more videos like this I put up two
to three videos a week makeup reviews
