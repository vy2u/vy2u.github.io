rack I and naked eye I baggie are you
done oh my goodness hello my friends
welcome to my monthly favorites video I
did not do a monthly favorites for june
i just got crazy i was on a no by with
some of my friends from keek disagreeing
518 and it was beauty talk and miss lola
lynn and yeah so i didn't buy anything
in july but i had got a chance to play
with all the stuff i got in june and i'm
not going to tell you about anything
that was just uh i would either talk to
you about whether it was awesome or it
was horrible i have about 20 things just
show you so I'm gonna try to zip through
this as quickly as I can first we're
gonna start with hair and then we're
going to work our way to face and then
make a pro I have found a Holy Grail
hair routine that makes my hair be able
to stand the humidity here humidity here
is insane I have been out in the heat
blowing up this baby pool and filling it
and my hair is still not frizzy and let
me show you the products that created
that this trusted my heat tamer spray is
amazing I learned about this from my
friend Stephanie at little lady low real
low Laurie Laurie little lady lori i
will put a link to her channel down
below and also my friend Amelia st. john
loves this stuff it's cheap and it's
awesome also I just got this in my new
beauty test you boo oh it's amazing this
is the it's a 10 miracle leave-in light
this is what really puts it over the
edge for saving the fridge and the
flyaways this will be repurchased I
guarantee it the other thing that has
made a huge difference in my hair is
going to be no shocker and I finally
broke down and got the macadamia natural
oil hair mask this lives up to the hype
my friends I'm telling you it lives up
to the hype Vista is phenomenal if you
don't want to invest the thirty-five
dollars in this I know that my ulta
carries the little sample packs I think
there are five dollars it's definitely
worth trying my
here is extremely unmanageable extremely
it's thinner not thin but thinner and
very very frizzy whoo cannot stand my
hair but this has made a huge difference
in the softness and manageability of my
hair highly highly highly highly highly
recommend let's move on to self tanning
shall we and I have a win and a fail on
self tanning on million dollar gen okay
i bought this because casey homes um
it's blondie recommended this particular
one it was on hautelook and let me tell
you i don't like it and let me tell you
why I don't like it it's because i'm an
idiot it's because i obviously don't
know how to apply this product in a way
that is functional i'll show you a
picture there if i can find it i had
like a ring around my arm like this
because what i did was i sprayed this on
after my shower I was up for maybe an
hour so after my shower and then i went
to bed well when I went to bed I fell
asleep like this okay and then it made
like a mark here I also had like a spa
chewiness going on here and I mean
thankfully I put it on my face pretty
evenly but it was ridiculously biko
worse for making fun of me so bad
because I obviously don't know how to
apply this but what has say this was
this I got this in a beauty box I
forgive me for not telling knowing which
one but this is the st. Tropez as one
night only infant glow body lotion okay
this is not a tanning lotion this
doesn't keep your tamp look how dark
that is okay looks like it something for
somebody that is not my skin color but
look
okay that's completely blended in so you
can see how dark it makes my skin I mean
just gorgeous and when I was paler it
really made a difference just beautiful
beautiful color that it provides so what
I would do is I would spray two pumps of
this into a squeeze of this and then I
would put it on and then it was
functional I mean I tried this with a
mint I tried it without a mint I tried
it with a sponge I tried it with all
kinds of things and I just I failed
every time okay I'm obviously a spray
self-tanning idiot and I could not do
this so I will not be repurchasing as I
let's go to nails next I originally had
this again excuse the nastiness of the
products here but I had bought this
target brand nail polish remover like
that's what it ended up with oh it's
like spilling on me um no I totally just
spilled it on my nails but that's what
it looks like on the inside it's like a
scratchy plastic in there I did not
enjoy this one because it was not it
worked but just that the sponge inside
was very uncomfortable to use and
compared to this one this one does is
not even close they're about the same
price this is the ultimen this is for
399 ulta I this was my original one you
can see that it's disgusting and that's
because it is not travel friendly it
spilled all over the inside of my
plastic bag that had all of my makeup
products so a lot of my stuff got
completely ruined because of this going
at least the packaging the outside that
got completely ruined so that's how it
looks I'm an idiot why do I keep doing
that but that's what it looks like
brand-new and the sponge is extremely
extremely soft it also comes with this
little it's called a tow dollar and it's
funny when I saw dabur I automatically
thought a boy Dobler and your ass the
life he this here just the experience of
using this is so much nicer because the
sponge is so soft I absolutely love this
nail polish remover removes nail polish
very very quickly even Sparkle nail
polish comes off a lot faster using this
then like a spa you ever tried to use a
cotton ball this to remove Sparkle nail
polish does not work well moving on to
face I have a face fail and that is the
and dating cream I wish that julep would
have a system like if she dies of
identifying the skin color they sent me
medium and medium is way too dark for me
now I do appreciate that they didn't
send light because I know that that is
not fair to people who have dark skin
but I don't think that it's fair to send
a medium to everybody either if you
expect people to have a usable product
it works for my skin color now when I
first got it it to not work for my skin
color at all here comes the nail man
again so the deity cream I don't like it
because it is clumpy on my skin like I
don't feel like it blends very nicely I
don't feel like my makeup goes on well
over top of it it's just not a good
product in my opinion it did not work
for me and this is the way it was when
we got it and I saw a lot of people
complaining about this look okay you can
squeeze it all the way through and no
product comes out why didn't they just
make a package that fits the one ounce
of product one ounce of product is a
decent sized amount of product it's a
full-size product but they didn't what
were you thinking at julep it just makes
you feel like you got ripped off I have
a new Holy Grail concealer and it is
time bomb by the ball there is what that
looks like very soft creamy it's a
little light for my skin because I do
have a little bit of a task let me try
to cover the sparkle for you so you can
see how it covers I mean just covers
really really nicely I Wednesday it's
the most high coverage concealer that I
own but it is really good for dark spots
and for on dark circles I wouldn't save
the best for blemishes i would think
that blemishes you would need a war
full-coverage concealer but definitely
love this I don't get a lot of blemishes
so this one is absolutely perfect for me
oh and this is in the shade light medium
have to blush wins and one blush huge
giant fail let me show you the blush
fail first and it's from malli I did
show this to you before and I did set
tell you I was going to give it more of
a more love more try and I hate it I
absolutely hate this product and I feel
comfortable saying I hate this product
because it is
pletely useless ok I am digging my
finger into this blush trying to get a
swatch that is what it looks like on my
fingers and then here is a swatch and
you can see they're not I pigmented at
all there's like no color payoff
especially on the blush the blush is
completely and totally useless Nelly is
now being sold at all so so what I
wanted to warn you if you see this stay
far far away other cheek products I know
I'm late to the game on this but these
the wet and wild color icon seriously
how awesome are these things these are
just as good as high-end um you know
when wound is like a hit or miss the
eyeshadows are hit and this blush sure
is a hit I'm telling it reminds me of
the pigmentation of my bomb blushes you
look at that that's a lot that's what
I'm talking about that is what a blush
is supposed to do these nicks stick
blushes I have never seen anybody review
these and Nix was on hook look I got a
bunch of Nick stuff but this was the
stuff that I like the most so this is
tulip this is hibiscus and this is tea
rose what I love about these is the
staying power on them the blend ability
of them there and they're just
straight-up fun to use I mean you just
take it and go wrap and go on it when it
went done went went light on it
and done um and your blush is on and
that's it there so fast and so easy if
you were on the go or in a hurry these
are perfect yes on these absolutely all
right now moving on to I shout out my
friend Miss Ava from Ava's beauty talk
sent me these I could not find these
anywhere and I want to give away on her
channel and I'm so so thankful no I
heard a really negative things about
this one I don't feel like this deserves
negative I don't think it's fantastic
but I wouldn't say it's bad this one I
really love and having fun with they say
that this one is a Duke for the Naked
palette by urban decay I don't own the
Naked palette I on the naked tomb I
don't know whether it's a dude or not
but I know that these are extremely
blendable their creamy they're very
highly pigmented i'm not going to swatch
them i'm sure you can find them
somewhere swatched if you're curious
this is the nude awakening palette and
then this one is going into the going in
the wild but thank you so much to Ava
for sending me these goodies and some of
the other goodies she sent me she sent
me all kinds of so she's amazing i will
put a link to her channel down below I
love her another thing i want to show
you was this YBF eyebrow pencil i'm
shocked how much i love this when i
showed you this in the new beauty test
tube video I was a little concerned
because it was a little hard to apply
and one of my wonderful subscribers I'll
put her name here explained to me that
when you do it like that's for lighter
eyebrows and the harder you press is for
darker it kind of changes colors the
pas- I just broke it oh it's those in a
harder you press the darker and get so
that's how it works should that was
light medium and dark and I just did
that by by pressing harder on the pencil
another thing I love about this is the
spoolie on the back this is just a nice
to just go boo boo you know whenever you
need a little boo-boo okay you might
remember I got some mary kay stuff from
my friend Jen okay Jen I met through
YouTube she asked me if I wanted a box
of stuff to review and I did a box
opening of that i will link that video
down below but i want to show you some
of the things that i love that i got
from her big huge huge thing with that
jen is going to give you twenty percent
off your mary kay order which is
completely unheard of if you order
telling her jen lowes reviews sent me
the first thing i wanted to talk about
from the mary kay stuff was this purple
eye shadow this is a cream eye color
this is beautiful I have the color
tattoo the perp new purple color tattoo
and that doesn't even compare to how war
justice it but just beautiful creamy
just oh so easy to work with absolutely
love this I will definitely be buying
more of these from jen as soon as i'm
off my no Buy in August lipstick I got
this lipstick and rosary and again i
will be purchasing more lipstick just a
gorgeous bright pink perfect perfect
perfect for summer love this look at
this really super cool packaging watch
these you can see the color through the
top and when their contacts look how did
you like that pop ow you could play
younggu bomb okay next our last products
from mary kay this is my big fail from
mary kay which was the lash primer this
did absolutely nothing this is usually
usually lash primer is white this is
completely clear and it might as well
have been water I mean it did nothing I
got the lash love lengthening mascara in
my influenster box and then I got the
Mary Kay ultimate mascara from jen and i
love both of them the difference between
the two in my opinion is the lash love
is a more natural look and the ultimate
is a more dramatic fake lash kind of
look so i don't know if you can see but
this is the lash love and then this is
the ultimate this one i don't know if
you can see is a little clumpy erm
eyelashes are sticking together more but
this was more volumizing more
lengthening this one is a more natural
look not quite as lengthening not quite
as volumizing but a more natural long
beautiful lash look as soon as you put
this one on you you're like whoa dude my
lashes some crazies happening this one
takes a little bit of buildup you can do
a really nice soft natural lash with
just one coat of this this is three
coats of each just you can see what's
happening thank you for my hug buddy
that was nice if you were interested in
any mary kay stuff i will put jens link
down below she is awesome i highly
recommend you order from her if you're
looking at anything I loved the
lipsticks I love the blushes the eye
makeup remover is amazing and the
mascaras were really really good too so
those would be the things that i really
recommend oh and that eyeshadow based on
the cream eyeshadow phone big thumbs up
if you have any questions Jen will
answer them for you she is really good
at giving advice so definitely ask her
questions if you have any and take
advantage of that twenty percent off
because I don't know how long that's
gonna last the last thing I wanted to
talk about was some non beauty related
at to food products i want to share with
you and I never talk about food and that
justice is credit to how amazing this
stuff is a big fan of a mix of salty and
sweet this kettle corn is thinking
amazing it's by angie's and it is a
perfect amazing hitting the perfect mix
of sweet and salty and I've tried a lot
of kettle corn let me tell you and I
destroyed look at how big this badges
okay it's almost gone my kids love it I
love it as far as sugar it's got eight
grams of sugar in two cups so I will eat
this instead of having chocolate which
is like 14 grams of sugar for like two
squares of it this will last me a lot
longer I can sit and eat it while
watching TV and relax this is by no
means a healthy food but it's better
than some of the things that I've been
craving lately so I have been eating a
lot of this obviously with the giant
costco size bag alright the last thing i
want to show you this is no one look at
this do you know what that is that is
chocolate covered bacon yes it is it is
so good i got this let me show you what
it looks like a plug this doug
look Ned's up in that crazy this is a
piece of bacon covered in chocolate now

inside oh my goodness ladies Sulu's
sting guru now I got that at a place
