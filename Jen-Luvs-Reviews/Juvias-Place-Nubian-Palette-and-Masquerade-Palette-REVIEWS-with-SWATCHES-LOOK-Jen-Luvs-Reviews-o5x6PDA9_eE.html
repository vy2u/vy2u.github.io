hello my friends welcome to my review of
the GPS place I shadow palettes I'm
excited to bring this to you because I
feel like they are very different than a
lot of things that are on the market and
I'm excited to share my opinions with
you along with lots and lots of other
things gonna be jam-packed girlfriend or
boyfriend with information in this video
about these pallets so the first thing I
do want to mention is these were sent to
me by subscribers so I cannot speak to
the shipping times there's been a lot of
drama on the Internet's about the
shipping time for Julia's place pallets
I did not notice that they when she sent
me an email that she said she was going
to buy them for me which was so so kind
of her Thank You Nancy um that I didn't
notice that it took a particularly long
time for them to ship since when she
ordered them but I can't really speak to
that but I am going to speak to the
quality of the shadows so down in the
description below you'll be able to find
timestamps to all of the different
pieces of this video we're going to
first start talking about price and
availability and packaging and things
like that we'll go into some swatches
and then we'll go into a demo of the
products being applied to my eyes I am
wearing just this palette on my eyes
today so we'll show the demo that will
give you an ingredient analysis to tell
you whether there's any icky chemicals
or icky things that may hurt you in
these palettes and then we'll go into my
full review of the products so if you
want to skip ahead to any of that the
timestamps are down below you just need
to click them and they will take you
right there so let's go ahead and start
with the new Bien by Julia's this was
the first palette that they came out
with this one as of the filming of this
video is still available on their
website and it is on sale right now for
twenty three dollars and fifty cents I
don't know if it ever goes up any or if
that's just always the price you get 18
grams of product which equals a dollar
31 per gram which is relatively
inexpensive for eyeshadow when we're
getting into the more expensive stuff
we're talking two three four five
dollars a gram this is a very reasonably
priced palette for how much product you
get this is also a cruelty free product
so I know that matter
a lot to some people so definitely keep
in mind that this is cruelty free if
that's something that is very important
to you within this palette you get four
matte shades and the rest they call
shimmery pearl textured colors the matte
shades apply very well with a brush the
shimmer shades I find apply better with
the fingertips but we're going to show
you that in just a minute but before we
do let's talk about this one by the way
these are cardboard packaging with
magnetic closures there are no mirrors
they do feel quite sturdy but I could
see something getting missing can I push
this up if I try let's see fine let's
say I'm in a bag and I want to it's
pretty sturdy as far as the magnetic
closure it's not coming open which makes
me happy I mean you have to hit it
pretty hard for it to be open but if you
were going to travel with this I would
recommend get putting it in its own kind
of container just to make sure it
doesn't flop open this is the masquerade
by Judy as you can see the pan sizes are
ginormous compared to this one here I
mean this one it doesn't even I mean the
size doesn't even compare like this one
if you wanted to if eyeshadows never
went bad you could probably pass this on
your grandchildren I mean this thing
will last you first thing in ever this
is a $32 and 50 cent product it is fifty
seven point six grams of product which
is insane and it's fifty six cents per
gram which is an insane deal right now
this did seem to be sold out on the
website but that does not mean that it's
not coming back I do not know if it's
coming back and I've also found that the
shadows between these are very very
consistent in what they are and what
they do so if you learn a lot from this
video and you feel like you want to try
other gb/s place eyeshadow palettes I
would imagine they would be there
perform in a similar way to these even
if you can't get these so it's still
going to be very very valuable if you
want if you're interested in Julia's
place so within this you get five matte
eyeshadows this purple here and then
these four brownish and reddish brownish
British kinds of shades here the rest
are that creamy texture that creamy
shimmery texture so speaking of that
creamy shimmery texture I really want to
show you how they apply with a finger
and also how they apply with a brush so
I'm going to go into the swatches of
these two palettes
Oh
you got a fast car I wanted to get to
anywhere then we can make it to you
maybe together we can get somewhere
better places better start from zero I
live in Toulouse and maybe we'll make
something and me myself I got nothing to
prove
got a fast car I got a play they get us
out of here and another convenience
store then it saves a little bit of
money or won't abstract too far just
cross the border and into the sea you
and I can walk it just fine I see when
these me living
see my man's got a problem level the
Polish the way it is he says parts too
old for spicy I'm telling like his my
mom often left him she wanted more from
life than he could give I said
somebody's gotta take care of him so I
quit school that's what I did
you had a fast car is it fast and I like
a flyaway we gotta make a decision
leaves an island die this way
so I remember we were driving driving in
your car speed too fast for a common
strong city lights lay out before me
I had a feeling it
and
I had a feeling I could be someone be
someone be someone you had a fast car we
go cruising entertain ourselves stealing
got a job work at the market as checkout
girl I don't things that get better
you'll find work and I get promoted
we'll move out of the shelter I bigger
house live-in lover
armed squatches can look slightly
different than ice watches or the way
that it applies on an eye there just
isn't as much fat in an eyelid as there
is in an arm to keep the skin taut so
I'm gonna go ahead and show you how I
got this look today using the original
nubian palette that's all I have on my
eyes today as far as eyeshadows so go
ahead and check that out right now is
how you live Oh take take take it all
but you never give should've known you
was trouble from the first kiss had your
eyes wide open why were they open
gave you about a headache and tossed it
in the trash you tossed it in the trash
give me cuz what you don't understand is
I can't relate
you know
yes
oh you made
but you won't do the same no no no back
back black and blue beat me til I'm numb
tell the devil I said hey when you get
backed away from man badly
that's just what you are yet you'll
smile in my face the ripper breaks out
my car gave me one ahead and you tossed
it in the trash you tossed in the trash
yes
what you don't understand is I catch a
grenade
so you've seen how they apply and it is
it's I really honestly like I'm gonna
start reviewing a little bit because I
really really like these eyeshadows I
have to tell you I'm really enjoying
them and I find them to be quite
versatile I really do there was one day
I wish I could have done two eye looks
for you today but I just couldn't I'll
put an Instagram picture here of the
look that I came up with this shade
right here is really really fun
I think it's called Giza and what I did
was I put Giza and this purple shade
here and I put I mix them together and I
put them all over my lid then I stuck
Giza all by itself in the inner corner
and then stuck the shade on the outer
corner and it made this most gorgeous
purple look I mean it was beautiful I
cannot wait to do it with some of the
other colors like so excited about this
palette the way that the shadows play
together they just play so nicely
together I really really enjoy it okay
this is the thing though the brush works
really really well in the matte shades I
really love the matte shades and how
they go on you do have to kind of blend
them because they are really pigmented
so some of them you have to work a
little more for it to get them to blend
the way you want to but I do feel like
the shimmery shades definitely apply
better with a finger they remind me of
my Natasha Genoa eyeshadows a lot and
then Natasha de Nona's are really
expensive
they just feel really creamy now we've
got ones like Kairo right here that have
chunky gold glitter in them that is
quite different than let's say the shade
Casablanca which you can just feel is
very very different it's got like a
smoothness like a creaminess like a like
a dinette the coat even though there's
no dimethicone here I don't know how to
describe it it's just really really
smooth where this one is more powdery
and the mattes have a little bit more of
a powder feel but these creel II almost
feel like cream shadows on your finger
and there they work great as long as
you're willing to use your fingertips
they work fantastic
now that I told you how awesome they are
let's talk about the in cricket analysis
because you know there are some things
in here we got to talk about because I
can't let it go without telling you a
couple of things so the first one I mean
you can really tell that this was their
first pallet with the ingredients that
they chose to use in it first thing is
the first ingredient and this is talc
and a lot of people not a lot of people
but some people are sensitive to talc it
is listed as a 3 on environmental
working group along with
people being sensitive to this there is
they do talk about the contamination
concern of asbestos fibers but cosmetic
grade talc has not had a specify burr
since the 1970s so you don't have to
worry about that but I was reading on
cancer org every time I read something
new I have to include it and it says
studies that exposed lab animals rats
mice and hamsters to asbestos free talc
and various ways that had mixed results
with some showing tumor formations and
others not finding any so they're not
quite sure about that yet so that's up
to you whether you think that's a big
bad or not the big bad in here are the
parabens some people do not feel that
parabens are an issue there are research
studies to show that parabens are not an
issue some people though are very
sensitive to parabens and this does have
the one one of them that is labeled as
being a more potentially harmful paraben
which is called propyl propyl propyl I
think it's propyl paraffin it is a
paraben family it is a preservative
that's what all parabens are they're
preservatives and it mimics estrogen and
can act as a potential hormone and
endocrine system disrupt disruptors so
basically when your endocrine system is
disrupted they say that tumors can form
so that is a concern with parabens that
people have that was a big thing about
deodorant a long time ago and people
freaked out and people didn't want
parabens than anything and then there
were studies to say that that was not a
true study so I mean it's a very
controversial thing with parabens but
the ewg does mention that this does this
purple purple paraben is a really bad
one according to them so keep that in
mind and if you're sensitive to parabens
you may want to pass on this one
there's also mixed results for a
wildlife and environmental toxicity with
this particular paraben there's is
another pair of Indian in here called
methylparaben it's pretty much described
exactly the same way as the propyl
paraben but there's less evidence
against that one as there is in the one
that I just talked about and the last
thing in here is an ingredient that I've
never talked about on the channel and
it's called chromium oxide greens and
depending on which kind they get it can
be rated between a 2 and a 5 on
Environmental Working Group I didn't
mention that 10 is really really really
and one is seen as very low hazard so
this is a chromium oxide and it's a
mineral pigment that's used as a
colorant so it's it's part of the the
coloring in this palette it's used in
some hair dyes and there's mixed results
in the bioaccumulation of it so building
up in the human system it is suspected
to be an environmental toxin and also
suspected nano scale ingredients with
potential to absorb into the skin now
this is very very low on the ingredient
list once it gets passed 1% of the full
product they can list the ingredients in
any order I would imagine it will be
less than 1% of that ingredient in here
since it is a pigment it is part of the
coloring so I don't know how much of
that is in here but again if that
bothers you just so you know that is in
here now you can tell with this palette
they've learned a little bit they did
not include parabens in this product the
yellow one that they came out with as
well does not have parabens and I think
that they realized that was kind of not
not so good of a move for for customer
satisfaction to put that in there so
they did not include it in this one or
the yellow one that's available on the
website it does however containing talc
which we just talked about now this has
something called chromium hydroxide
greens which is relatively it's very
similar to the one that we just talked
about the chromium oxide greens it is
rated at two to four on Environmental
Working Group so not quite as bad Oregon
system toxicity has mixed results also
by accumulation is mixed results so that
one isn't rated quite as bad as the
other one that was in the green palette
and it says limited or incomplete
evidence of cancer according to the
safety hazard data government Assessment
cannot classify as a human carcinogen
due to data gap so they just haven't
studied it enough so they don't know
whether it's bad or not they haven't
given it enough study so if that bothers
you again this is going to be something
you do not want to get one big thing to
remember is the way that the chemicals
interact with each other can make
different reactions more or less there's
no real way to know there's a lot of
information that I just can't give you
in this video and also we don't know how
much of these ingredients you need to be
using it
for it to cause any of these effects so
this may just be a complete you know not
even meaning anything in the end because
there may just simply not be enough of
those dangerous products in here to harm
you so you just have to decide whether
you want to take that risk or not for
some fantastically performing shadows
nope
speaking of that I do want to just talk
a little bit more about the performance
of these shadows again I just really
love them I've really been enjoying
using them they they blend just so
easily and they're really fun to use I
think the colors are very fun I do wish
with this palette here I wish that they
had knocked out one of these deeper
shades and given us a matte champagne
that I would have really really loved
that because I feel like they've really
gone heavy on the deep sand maybe
because this was most likely designed
for women of color they went really
heavy on the deeps but I personally
being the selfish one that I am really
want a matte champagne in here that's
just me personally but other than that I
feel like the color selection is very
good I mean it does look like a lot like
a lot of the palettes that are out now
with all of these deep reds and brick
colors with the champagnes and the
warmth and all of that it's very common
so this one I feel like is a little less
unique as far as the color selection
than this I mean you know I have the
Urban Decay electric palette I have some
other palettes I have some Kat Von D
very very bright shades and I feel like
this is unique I feel like the shades in
here unique I feel like the formula is
unique in that it has that you know the
way that it feels on to the eyes with
little to no effort just by touch by
patting it onto the lids
they're just really fun to play with I'm
really enjoying them a lot and if you're
a color lover I would definitely
recommend going for some of the colored
shades because they're just they're just
fun so it comes down to you and also
that it's a fantastic deal I mean
they're they're very inexpensive for
what you get and I don't know for me
it's a recommend I'm loving them not
McDonald's I they just started thinking
dududududu I hope you enjoyed my review
