the whoops that way to see this place
the Heron palette and now you may know
if you go to Julia's place calm this was
currently sold out on their website but
I have information from Julia's place
that this will be restocked sometime in
March so you can still get your hands on
it and that's why I'm reviewing it and I
am so excited to tell you all about this
palette Tveit place is an andy brand out
of new jersey i have really liked their
previous palette so i was so excited
when my friend Nancy decided she was
going to send this to me so that I could
review it so Thank You Nancy for sending
this to me when I first saw this palette
I have to be honest with you I was a
little confused by the color selection I
was kind of like what are they thinking
what are they doing but I do have
opinions about that we're going to save
the full review for the end if you've
never seen one of my reviews before just
so you know they're very very long but I
have skip ahead buttons in the
description box you just need to click
the time/space stamp in the description
box and we'll take you exactly where you
want to go if you're interested in a
specific part if you want to go straight
to my full review you can do that by
going to the link of the description box
first thing you need to know is that
this is cruelty free but it is not vegan
it does contain carmine which is made
from beetles so this is not vegan it is
distributed from New Jersey so if you
live in New Jersey you will have to pay
tax
it is designed and formulated in the
United States but it is manufactured in
the People's Republic of China or PRC
there is some discussion about whether
something made in China is able to be
cruelty free and yes it can I will link
an article down below regarding that so
the in case you have any questions about
why this can be made in the in China and
also be cruelty free go ahead and click
that link for more information this is a
$28 eyeshadow palette as far as price
per gram this is insanely inexpensive
it's very inexpensive so let me just
tell you the palette is $28 you get 18
grams of product inside let me open it
so you can see it you get 18 grams of
product inside which ends up being a
dollar 56 per gram this is cheaper than
any high-end eyeshadow palette I own by
far the closest one is a Kat Von D
metal matte palette which was very close
to this but still just a tad bit more
expensive program than this this does
not have a mirror I forgot to mention
that they are one and a half gram pans
which is pretty standard for a single
eyeshadow they do not pop out but I can
see they are nestled into a pan so if
you wanted to do pop this you probably
could if you really wanted to the next
part of this video is my favorite and
it's the swatches so I'll go ahead and
show you how to use a finger swatch and
brush swatch right now all right here
the swatches for the saharan palette
this was the very first time that I put
my fingers in these shadows and it was
extremely enjoyable if I must say so in
this first row is definitely my favorite
just I mean look at that the finger
squashes are insane they're absolutely
insane the brush watch for Sokoto I
don't feel like does it super justice
you can really get it up to that full
pigmentation on the eye if you want to
whadda be is just it's perfection it's
absolute perfection it looks just like
that on the eye borough row I think is
how you pronounce it is also just
perfect and Tia is perfect I have
nothing bad to say about any of this top
row I mean Sokoto being a matte shade
the fact that got that thing to be so
beautiful with a brush just unbelievable
I don't know what fairy they hired or
bribed to help them to put magic into
this palette but they did something good
now this is the white test and the
purpose of this is to show how the
shadows may fade over time or how
they'll perform if you over blend and
you notice this Sokoto and kiya hang out
there really well
watubi Umbro kind of fade away the
second row is my least favorite but it's
still a really good row this one is my
absolute least favorite of the shadows
and that's a Zoe oh that first one I'm
on is really nice Jamila is good it's a
little bit difficult to work with it
kind of is a little bit tricky to blend
but it's still a really good shadow so
as the only one that I feel like doesn't
perform well and you'll see that in the
demo as well it just doesn't perform
well it might also be due to my skin
tone as well
brush watch I don't feel like it does it
100% justice you'll see it better in the
demo Jamila is good it's a good shadow
it's just a little harder to get to move
where I want it to move and Senegal is
just as magical as that top row just oh
my gosh like I don't even know what to
say there's just so much magic there
like I don't even know what to say now
with the white test and Jamila and
Senegal hang out there really well the
way actually hangs on pretty well but
I'm on is gone it's completely gone so
just be aware of that when you're using
the shadows now this final row second
favorite row we have Chad casino Lulu
and schoola
chad is amazing Katsina you're going to
see in a minute in the demo I use it as
a crew shade Lulu's my least favorite in
this row but it's still a really good
shadow like Lee's favorite meaning that
it's like an 8 out of 10 it's really
good look at Chad I mean you want a
black smoky eye chad is your shade
Katsina is actually really easy to work
with it looks a little a little stiff
there but it's really easy to work with
Lulu you just kind of have to build it a
little bit just show it a little love
and there's a love you back and then
fula is just I've never seen a shade
like Lola before I mean maybe you have
but I've never seen a shade like that
that metallic pink just like you ever
just look at a shadow and you just love
it so much it's just like hits your soul
so when you do the white test you can
see Chad is not going anywhere if it
does smudge and smear which is good for
smokey eyes Katsina hangs out there
really well Lulu kind of fades away a
bit but fula hangs in there pretty well
so really really good solid swatches on
this palette now you've seen how they
apply to arm skin now I want to show you
how I got this look today using this
eyeshadow palette I did have to dip into
my naked 2 palette for a brow bone shade
but you'll see that in the demo I wanted
to use as many colors as possible as
you'll see that in this without talking
any more let's just watch the demo just
see how it all works go ahead
do back in the boss Tom them away and
don't you go and go go
I want to push it if you don't really
fit hey I get to living in effect what
what hey we got busy a little I'm just
counting on that stop and just get me on
my feet and Jim gasps miss me Lily
cuz if you make me when I'm with you I
don't you
you said drag me on back and then you
step back me once I just expect that
don't waste our major parts of the video
the next one is ingredient analysis and
after that will be my full review so
ingredient analysis is when I go to
environmental working group org and
other websites that I trust to tell you
about whether there's anything in here
that may cause problems with the
environment or with sensitive eyes or if
there's anything in here that could
cause harm to you in any way that's what
this section is about so the first
ingredient in here is talc its a bulking
agent what they do is they take the
pigment and the child kind of fluff it
up a little bit a little bit and gives
the pigment something to stick to
how can be an irritant for some people I
will link some information about talc in
the description below another thing that
may be irritating to some people is at
the hexyl palmitate it's an emollient
it's made out of palm oil so it gives it
that that moistness that slip and these
are very very very moist
so the xoxo palmitate helps with that
with that slip this is also something
that people can have sensitivity to so
just you know that is in here as well
the nectar is in here is a very
interesting ingredient and that's
mineral oil and I did some research on
mineral oil it is ranked as a 1 to 3 for
environmental working group org it's
classified as expected to be toxic or
harmful by the environment kantha canada
domestic substance list which i thought
was very interesting AWG says that most
of the concern is when mineral oil is
inhaled which of course you're not going
to inhale your eyeshadow pallete I hope
this information is from polished choice
which is a website that I love it says
despite mineral oils association with
petroleum and the hype that it's bad for
for or ages the skin keep in mind that
petroleum is a natural ingredient
derived from the earth once it's
purified to become mineral oil USP which
is cosmetic grade
no resemblance to the original petroleum
and isn't a source of contaminant so
that's from them cosmetics info George
said that there were some concerns with
some inflammation of the liver if you
ingested it and some topical things but
they basically disproved all of that so
according to those sources mineral oil
is fine according to Canada they still
have an issue with it so I'm not sure
you just kind of have to take those
pieces of information and do with it
what you will there's also some a couple
of little things you need to know about
the pigments that are in here ferric
ferrocyanide and chromium oxide greens
are not supposed to be used on the mouth
so do not use this to brighten up your
lip colors it's not a good idea and then
the yellow colorant in here which is I
think called yellow 5 Lake I believe
there's some mixed data on whether or
not the ingredient is biofuel ative and
toxic for scientists in Canada but it's
used a lot in a lot of cosmetics so if
you have a problem with that ingredient
you probably want to check your
cosmetics because it's really included
in a lot of things but other than that
there's really nothing else going on in
here I personally don't see any huge red
flags unless you have really really
sensitive skin to the ingredients that I
mentioned before so now on to my full
review of this product I will tell you
first off that I love the shadow I
really do I love them I find them very
easy to work with as far as the quality
of the shadows I do find the shade
selection a bit difficult to work with I
would definitely recommend the other
original nubian palette for people that
have never used eyeshadow before it's
much much easier to work with
I would probably even recommend the
masquerade palettes over this just
because I find this to be a little
confusing as far as what can go where
and I can just see some craziness coming
out of it if you're not careful you can
just kind of go a little nuts but I will
tell you it is really fun if you have
experience using eyeshadows and you want
something different in your life this is
a wonderful option I find that the
shadows are very very easy to use
and that's one thing I really love that
it's effortless it's absolutely
effortless you don't have to worry about
shadows fading away when you're trying
to blend them you don't have to worry
about them blending into each other so
much they look muddy it's not going to
happen you probably don't have much in
your collection that looks like this I
mean it's just a really fun different
kind of palette which I really
appreciate
now this shade up here I wanted to give
special note to its called Tia and it is
one of those brown green ones I do have
a lot of brown green eyeshadows Mac
makes one there's one in the newer newer
tardis Pro palette even wet and wild
comfort zone palette has one but this
one is different in that it's deeper
it's got a deepness to it and it's more
of a teal rather than a green which is
kind of interesting and I feel like the
green really shows through more than the
brown which i think is unique so if you
like those brown green eyeshadows this
is something you will probably really
enjoy because it's different than all of
the other ones in that way I really like
their foiled formula it is wonderful if
you like that pop if you really like
that pop I wish that this one over here
is the whale was a little bit more poppy
it's a little bit mild compared to the
other ones so we just can't compete with
it I feel like I really need to use I'm
on the way that I put it in my inner
corner instead of Zoya because it just
doesn't compete so who is this eyeshadow
palette best for I feel like people with
any skin tone can love this and have a
lot of fun with it but it really is for
color lovers for people that like bright
shades people look like out of the box
makeup look if you like something safe
this is not your palette this is not a
safe palette go with new being one if
you have aging lids where you have some
creepiness you will be able to get some
love out of this and one thing that's
fun if you have aging lids and you're a
little nervous about popping you know
this one right here this bright gold all
over your lid you can throw it on the
lower lash line for an extra little pop
of color and that's a lot of fun or you
could use it as an eyeliner take your
eyeliner brush put a thick stripe over
your lash line and then take a black
liner and hug that right next to your
lash line you'll have this beautiful
stripe of gold and it
looks really beautiful without being
completely overpowering SARS where time
on these shadows I can get them to less
beautifully through a worker school day
you can probably bring it into the
evening but by the end of the evening
you're going to see that it's gonna it's
not going to look the same girlfriend or
boyfriend it's not going to look the
same as it did when you first put it on
of course but the lasting power is
pretty darn good I must say I'm very
happy with it so if you haven't figured
it out yet this is a definite recommend
from me to you I really feel like
Julia's place is one of the most
consistently good formulas of eyeshadow
that I have ever seen I just I feel like
they're just bringing everything to a
new level I feel like the only brand
that can compete with Julia's place is
coloured raine there's no one else
that's even in the ballpark right now
like nobody-nobody I mean you think
about some of the brands that are just
outright failing right now that used to
be good or people used to think they're
good but I think they're just Julia's
place and coloured raine I feel like or
just bringing the eyeshadow game to a
whole nother level and I'm just really
excited for them I hope that they do
well and I hope that if you do buy this
house I hope that you love it as much as
I do I am not affiliated with Julia's
place they did not send this to me I
just happen to absolutely love their
product so I want to thank you so much
for watching this video if you enjoyed
it definitely make sure you subscribe
again I have the video as with the
eyeliners linked down below if you're
curious about these both of these
products will be back in March so keep
your eye out for those and again I just
want to thank you so much for watching
Mad Love and I'll see you in a video
