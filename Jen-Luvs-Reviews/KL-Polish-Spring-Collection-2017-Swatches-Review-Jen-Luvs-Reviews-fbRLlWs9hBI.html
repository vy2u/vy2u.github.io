video this week all about youtubers who
create their own cosmetic lines we just
did Ronnie cosmetics on Wednesday and
now we are going to be talking about KL
polish and kathleenlights nail polish
line stay tuned no kathleen like she has
a very popular youtube channel i will
link it down below and i do want to
disclose that I have met Kathleen before
and it was not a long conversation I
wasn't even really a conversation it was
just really me introducing myself to her
saying hello telling her that I really
enjoy her channel and that was kind of
the end of it I wouldn't even call her
an acquaintance so at this point I just
met her one time a generation Beauty in
New York City so I just want to put that
out there I also want to let you know
that these polishes are here in this
video thanks to the super chat you may
know that on Sundays I do have a weekly
chat with the community here with the
collective braid of makeup awesomeness
and I had enabled the super chat which
means that people can donate to the
channel so that I can buy extra products
for review on the channel and the
kathleenlights collection was something
that I purchased with super chat money
so the names that are scrolling next to
me right now are the people that
purchase this collection so I want to
thank you so much for your donation so
that I could do this review let's talk a
little bit about this line so this is
Kathleen's second line she did a fall
line and now she's done a spring line
there are six polishes in the collection
and they're eight dollars and fifty
cents each
you used to be able to get the bundle
which is what I got it was on sale for
$45 now it is completely sold out
the only shade in the collection that is
sold out as of the filming of this video
is that's what she said the rest of the
fall collection does seem to all be
available but just this one right here
seems to be sold out which I wouldn't
cry about too hard I'll let you know why
in a minute all the nail polishes are
cruelty free they are made in the USA
and they are nine free so there's a list
of ingredients that are considered
harmful to people and
people like five free nail polishes I
think there are seven free nail polishes
and there's also nine free nail polishes
so basically they don't have the stuff
that everybody considers hi everybody
but the scientific community sees as
being bad one thing that's really really
strange though that I have to say now
that I'm looking at my notes it says
nine free polishes are also free of
parabens and acetone but acetone is
actually listed as one of the
ingredients in the polishes so I'm very
confused by that and I would reach out
to Kathleen right now but I really need
to get this video because I got to pick
my kids up from the bus stop in a minute
but I will put any information that I
get from tail polish after I contact
them about the acetone thing in the
description box below because that is
really weird
the only other ingredient that I found
that was any controversy over was
something called benzophenone I believe
is that it is one there is an allergy
concern for the skin but you don't
typically put the nail polish on your
skin but if you're sensitive to it just
you know that's in there there is a
little bit of talk on the internet about
this ingredient being bad but it
couldn't find anything from a credible
source they were all blogs and things
saying that it was bad and I don't know
the credibility of those particular blog
so I am going to say as far as my
research I don't see anything wrong with
it I will link a blog it did do a lot of
research on this ingredient I will link
her post down below so let me tell you
how I tested these so what I did was I
wore each Polish with my favorite base
book which is the julep base coat I wore
each Polish until it shipped
significantly and then I tried it with
that base coat I also tried with no base
coat and no top coat I also tried a few
of the polishes with a base both a base
coat and my sachets Seche vite Seche
vite LSAT sachet vite sister's eat with
my session beats a top coat so I didn't
try every single one with the semi top
coat but I tried the ones that were most
problematic so I tried eat a lot and
part of the reason why I tried them a
lot was because it's just really really
really fast but within three days they
chipped but that is typical for me for
nail polishes that are in this price
range with OPI is with a sees those chip
on me within two to three days the ones
that don't chip on me that faster the
juleps and the
or leaves and the Soyuz the ones that
are a little bit more expensive actually
things oil might be in that price range
sums always chip faster but a lot most
of them last really well on me but
that's my personal nails I know that
everyone's nail oils and things like
that are different but that was my
personal experience of state shipped
very quickly no matter what I did base
coat no base coat topcoat no topcoat I
they chipped so that was a big bummer
for me but that's not necessarily for
every single person that wears them so I
do want to show you how these polishes
go on to the nail I'm going to do a
close with my nails in real time and
show you how many coats it takes for
full opacity for each polish so I'm
going to go ahead and show you that
right now
we're going to go ahead and start off
with the Drule up base coat this is my
favorite base coat it is the oxygen
bonding base coat I feel like it helps
my nail polish to stay on a lot longer
and like I mentioned earlier the
polishes from kale polish don't tend to
stay on me very long so I feel like this
base coat give them the best shot I'm
really curious I heard Kathleen talking
about that she was going to develop her
own base coat so I'm very excited to to
see what she comes up with now my nails
are not Instagram nails I'm a mom it
does the dishes and the laundry look too
much base coat oh we just want we just
want put polish on that now please for
the video anyway that was way too much
base coat but I you know I have regular
people nails you know not people that do
in the nail polish video nails so I'm
going to let these dry a little bit and
I'll be right back I've given them about
five minutes or so so let's go ahead and
start off with my favorite which is Miss
Honey one thing I absolutely love about
these polishes is the brush it's curved
at the bottom so it makes it perfect to
go on the nail because it curves right
down to the base there you see I'm just
going to put that one swipe on and
that's enough done and I love that about
these polishes so now we'll go to my
second favorite which is Saint Clair
moving on - that's what she said
this one's beautiful - go on you've done
that ones the only one I feel like is
done in one coat this is coconut milk
and hug and roll
a little patchy I'll fix it on the
second coat and then finally we've got
stache yo ice cream okay so this is
total one so you can see that the first
one which is Miss Honey it's definitely
going to need another coat but it looks
pretty good
same thing with the second st. Clair I
think we're done with the that's what
she said definitely going to need
another coat on me what's this called
coconut milk and then definitely going
another coat on hug and roll and
definitely another coat on the pistachio
ice creams I'm going to let these dry
and I'll be right back let me night when
they show you that thought was really
cool this is my only your nail polish
this is in the shade
Vernice 2 to 7 grease yeah and this is
the brush and you can see it's very
similar to the KL polish brushes so when
I saw the brush on the kale polish I was
like yes because I have never seen a
Polish at this price point with a brush
that's curved at the bottom and it
really does help with application so I
was really happy about that when I saw
that okay so let's go in for coat number
- starting with miss honey and then you
can see that one is now finished
hey as st. Claire after the second coat
is also now opaque I don't need a second
coat on this one here which was that's
what she said and by the way I didn't
mention that I did shake these polishes
before I started the camera so I know
someone's going to ask me tell me that
there's something wrong because I didn't
shake the polish but I did okay so that
one actually looks really good in
comparison with other times that I've
used this
no one actually looks streaker than I
remember when I used it before I'm going
to have to do another coat on that one I
do like this pink shade better than the
light though just as a personal
preference and lastly a pistachio ice
cream like my hand is shaking a lot
where the normally would and this one
looks like it's going to need a third
coat today to which I don't remember
from from when I was using it before so
I don't know maybe I didn't put an awful
on on the first coat but to see you know
I guess these three are the ones that
are going to need a third coat these
last three I didn't close it up hopes if
you close it all the way Jenn so these
three here coconut milk hug and roll and
pistachio ice cream are going to need a
third coat for today but I guess
depending on how you paint your nail you
may not need a third coat I feel like I
want to do a third coat today so we're
going to let these dry and we'll be
right back
oh no I didn't get a little bit oh well
let's see how it covers up the ding so
the third coat going on and I got a
little ding I'm not going to worry about
it but you can see that it's at full
opacity now so I've got all all of these
at full opacity and let's go ahead with
this one I find drying time on these to
be pretty typical it really just depends
on the topcoat if I leave them to dry
naturally they take about 10 to 15
minutes to dry completely well I'm only
letting them dry for about 5 minutes
between coats which I know everyone's
got their own strategy for painting
their nails that's just mine as I get is
about 5 minutes between coats if you
have your own strategy that you'd like
to share for how to get your nails to
dry faster that would be awesome to
share another thing you can do which is
great is to dip your nails in icy water
which is a nice free way to dry your
nails quickly ok so we are at full
opacity for all six shades three coats
on these two coats on these and one coat
in the center one thing I want to point
out is if you look these do not have a
top coat and look how glossy they are
they're just a really beautiful formula
with the shine on them I don't think I
own too many polishes that have
that level of showing on them without a
topcoat usually takes the top coat to
get to there so I definitely think
that's great about this formula and
they're all like that these of course
over sir are wet so but these are these
are drawing and they will continue to
look like that even when they're dry and
then the metallic nature of this one is
really beautiful I'm going to give these
a minute to dry and then I'll apply the
top coat just so you can see what it
looks like with my session top coat on
so these are the nails that have the
Seche vite top coat if you don't know
such feat this is a drugstore it's about
I don't know about eight dollars
something like that at most drugstores
you can buy this some people really
don't like such Mead
I personally really like it I think it's
very effective there are some ingredient
concerns on this especially for pregnant
women so definitely look into that if
you were pregnant but other than that I
really really like this top coat if you
have any other ideas or things that you
believe about Seche vite you feel free
to leave those in the comments below so
anyway so this is how it looks with the
top coat and you can see how much
shinier that that's what she said got
it's a little less metallic as far as
just base metallic and now it's metallic
and a shine on it and the rest of them
just got a little bit shinier so those
are the swatches I hope that was helpful
and now back to my final box so if I had
to recommend any single polishes to you
it would be Miss Honey and st. Claire
these two I feel like are the most
everyday wearable especially Saint
Claire and I feel like any skin to
skin tone can rock this like this one is
a little bit more well don't know how
many people are into blue nail polish
but if you are I definitely recommend
this one as well two that are just okay
for me are the pistachio ice cream and
hug and roll and the ones that are a
little more difficult to work with are
that's what she said and coconut milk
those are the ones that are kind of like
men not really my favorites so I want to
