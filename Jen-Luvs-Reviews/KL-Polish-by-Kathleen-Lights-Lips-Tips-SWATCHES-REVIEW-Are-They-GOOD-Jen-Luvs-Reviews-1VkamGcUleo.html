standing there welcome to my channel
today we will be reviewing the Kol
polished lips and tips set if you are
interested in my opinion on these nail
polishes and whether they are worth your
purchase then hang tight because we're
about to get right into that right now
before I get into the review I do want
to let you know that this was sent to me
by Kol polish with the obligation to
review I did agree to do a review video
but I am NOT being paid for this video
I do not benefit at all from your
purchase I just knew that this was
something that people that are
subscribed to my channel would be
interested in so therefore I told them
yes you can send it and yes I will do a
review but beyond that there is no
affiliation between myself and Kayla
polish and again I don't anything from
your purchase of this and they are not
paying me to make this video a little
bit about the brand information it was
created by kathleenlights and if you're
not familiar with her I will put her
cute little face right there she is a
youtuber on YouTube that does Beauty
videos she started her own nail polish
align and it has been out for quite a
while now I did invest in her fall
collection back when it first came out I
do have a review of that that I will
link down below for you in case you're
interested in that the only place you
can buy this set or any Kayle polish is
on que ella polish dot-com they do
charge a 495 flat rate shipping to the
United States there's no option for free
shipping to Canada the flat rate is 895
for basic shipping and 13 95 for
expedited shipping the International
shipping outside the US and Canada is
$9.99 there are some countries that they
do not ship to so you can look on their
website for a full list of countries
outside the US and Canada they will not
ship - it looks like they ship to the
majority of countries in the world one
thing that's important to know is that
all sales are final from KL polish so if
you end up not liking something then you
cannot return it the only way you can
return it is if the polish comes broken
nail polish is cruelty free and vegan
they are made in the United States all
kale polishes are 5 free and now the new
formula is now 7 and 9 free so basically
there's like a list of things that
people don't like to see in nail
polishes and
I strive to be five free it's relatively
rare to see ones that are nine free most
nail polishes are five free one thing
that was interesting in their faq as
they talked specifically about acetone
even though acetone is listed as a may
or may not contain on their polishes
they actually don't use acetone in the
nail polishes it's just something
they're approved to use but they don't
actually use it so now specifically on
lips and tips like I mentioned you do
get six nail polishes and a lipstick
liquid lipstick and the set is $45 so
let's say you decided to buy each
individual polish for eight dollars and
fifty cents each by getting the kit
you'd be saving six dollars and you were
getting the liquid lipstick as well so
it is a good deal if you like all of
them but let's say you only like five of
them I would recommend getting them as
individuals because that will bring you
to 40 to 50 which is less so if you're
not going to use the lipstick and you're
not going to use one of the polishes
definitely get them as singles instead
this is a limited edition set so if you
don't get the set just know that the
polishes individually should be an
option I don't believe the individual
polish shades are limited-edition I did
a little bit of price comparison with
other nail polishes that seemed to be in
a similar price range one thing that you
should know is that you do get a little
bit less polish in a KL polish most
brands seem to have point 5 fluid ounces
these have 0.41 fluid ounces so you are
getting a little bit less polish so like
for example compared to OPI you're
paying 1050 for a Polish where
kathleenlights you're paying 850 so they
end up being about the same value as he
and Zoya polishes upfront you're paying
50 cents more for them but again because
you get more polish it is a little bit
better of a value and then China Glaze
is 750 per bottle and the standpoint 5
ounces so that would be the best deal
out of all of them as far as how much
actual polish you're getting for your
money but I do feel like that KL polish
is comparable in price to those brands
so now what we are going to do is I'm
going to take out each one of these
polishes and I'm going to swatch them
all for you on my nails I do want to
preface the swatches with that I am NOT
a professional nail artist I don't even
review nail polish all that often so my
swatches are not professional swatches
the point of the swatches is to show you
the opacity of the nail polish to show
you how many coats it takes for
Oh pasty that's the point not just show
you how to paint nails okay I just want
to make sure I put that in there because
people will give me a lot of flack for
my swatches last time let me go ahead
and get into that right now so you can
see what these nail polishes look like
on my hands I decided as I was sitting
down to do this that I do want to give
you a little bit of review commentary on
these polishes as I apply them so this
is the shade Taurus and it is described
as a mid-tone yellow brown and she says
it screams fall which I totally agree if
no fall is uh it's over we can let fall
go for the year but it really is
beautiful so let's go ahead and apply
this now you notice that if the brush
tip is a bit rounded so it makes it
really easy to apply the shade because
it's rounded just like the bottom of my
nail which I absolutely love
and you can see it's not completely
opaque in one coat but that's okay kale
polish does say that knee should be
applied in two coats so I'm gonna go
ahead and just paint the rest of them
with one coat so we can save a little
bit of time because she also recommends
that you let the first coat dry
completely before you apply the second
coat so this one is point zero and it's
described as a cool toned gray brown
it's as the edgy nude you've been
waiting for so it is very cute I like
this it's um it reminds me of chocolate
like a milk chocolate
and the same where it's not completely
opaque but it's really not supposed to
be after one code according to them
moving on to Aquarius this is a soft
pinky nude as she calls us everyone's
favorite lipstick in a polished form I
thought she would say Lumiere would be
everyone's favorite lipstick and
polished firm it's kind of interesting I
copied this off of her a website so she
also says she doesn't she says don't
shake thumb she says she that you're
really supposed to roll them I don't
know I'm more of a shaker than a roller
so I don't know I'm gonna have to get
used to rolling the polishes I know
there's lots of reason to roll rather
than shake but I'm old-school okay so
let's go ahead and apply this one this
one is the most sheer out of this set
but it's still very very nice moving on
to Alyssa and Alyssa's described as a
muted pink that's perfect for everyday
wear and I just love how the brush
spreads out over the nail because you
can really get the whole nail at least
my size nails you can get it in one
swipe which I absolutely love even
juleps which are my favorites don't do
that you did the brush is way better on
these all right here comes Lumiere this
is the one I was most excited to try
because it matches her her color pop
colors so this is a super on-trend dusty
mauve pink
I just realized I wasn't rapping the
tips I'm gonna take this off
right after I film because I'm not going
around with my nails like this so when
I'm trying to do a nail polish test and
not just watches I will rap the tip this
one here is called November and it is a
warm peachy pink that will brighten up
any day
and you can see they I mean they're
really pretty opaque for one code and
one thing I definitely want to mention
is the theis dry really fast like
impressively fast so for example I'm
just gonna dig my nail into the side of
this just to show you you see how it's
not completely I think I hopefully you
can see that it's just got a little dent
if I if I kind of dig my nail in there
like they're already about half dry and
all I had time to do is paint six nails
and they're already have tried this
video has been filming for six minutes
and like you see this is almost
completely dry but I'm gonna give them
like another four minutes like a 10
minute total dry time just to make sure
they completely dry before we apply the
second coat so I'm going to turn off the
camera and we'll be back in four minutes
alright we are back and nails are
completely dry you can see I can go like
this and they're all completely dry no
dings and it's been about ten minutes
which is stinkin amazing so I'm just
going to quickly put on the second coat
of each polish and then we'll talk about
it and we'll wrap the tip just for fun
so as you can see they are all opaque in
two coats they're all really beautiful I
really enjoy these on my skintone I
think that they would be beautiful on
all skin tones to be completely honest
with you I don't know anybody that
doesn't look pretty with a pink nail the
only one that I would say maybe not
would be this brown one because it's so
warm tone so maybe someone with a cooler
skin tone may not look like that also
actually now looking at this 1.0 this
one is very cool tone so someone with a
warm skin tone may not prefer that but I
can see really these Pink's being
beautiful on any body of any skin tone
at all I think you being absolutely
gorgeous but these may flatter certain
skin tones more than others and maybe
you know maybe you don't like pink nail
polish if you don't like pink nail
polish you're definitely not gonna like
this set I also want to show you that
this actually just came in the mail
today this is the winter glamour land
nail polish a set that is brand new for
holiday of 2017 I'm gonna do a separate
video of just swatches for these because
I don't have time to review them before
the holidays are over so look for this
in another video very very soon just
nail swatches of these just so you
couldn't see what they look like as far
as the opacity of them so now that
you've seen the swatches let's go on to
my full review of these products and now
for my full review of these polishes
because this is a limited edition set I
didn't want you to run out of time to to
purchase them so I was only able to try
two of the polishes and fully wear them
I wanted to wear them until they ship to
the point where I could not wear them
any longer so I tried Lumiere which was
the one I was most excited about and I
also tried point 0 which is what's on my
nails right the second if this wasn't
limited edition I would have taken the
time to try all of them before I
reviewed them but I wanted to get this
to you so I can speak to the wear time
of these two and I really do feel like
they have improved the formula I
couldn't find a formula list of their
old polishes that I had tried before so
I can't tell you exactly that they are a
different formula but they seem like
they have improved it I did have some
problems with shipping within one to two
days with the old formula what seems to
be happening with these is that they
kind of seem to chip a little bit on the
tips of mine
and I have been trying to wrap the tips
both with the polish and with my base
and top coat that's what I've been doing
if it's wrong I'm sorry but that's what
I've been doing and that particular way
that I've been doing it for whatever
reason the very very edges of my nails
seem to chip but the overall lasting
power on my entire nail has been
fantastic I am NOT a perfectionist and
that I need my nail to be perfect
looking all the time I want 98% of my
nail coverage if they have a little ding
here and there I personally don't care
that's why I really really like these as
I feel like they last a really really
long time
other than those very edges of my nails
all of the polishes apply beautifully in
two coats which i think is fantastic
most nail polishes will apply in two
coats if they take three or four coats I
am NOT interested at all unless they are
meant to be sheer they're meant to be
sheer I'm still not interested because I
don't like sheer nail polishes I do
compare these to the soil ones that I
absolutely love I love Zoya and I love
julep those are my favorite nail
polishes as far as the shade selection
of the collection I think she did a
really nice job number one being on
trend and number two with thinking about
lots of different skin tones I feel like
these would look beautiful on any body I
feel like they would look best on people
with neutral to warmer skin tones but I
do feel like people with cooler skin
tones could definitely get away with a
lot of these colors as well it's nice
when you have a set like this and you
feel like you can wear all of them to
your job of course everybody's job is
different but they seem more work
wearable than let's say a blue or a
green or a yellow or something like that
so I think that's really really cool
they did that as far as the liquid
lipstick I did want to talk about that
for a minute I did not try this liquid
lipstick in particular I do own and am
wearing Lumiere the lipstick I wish that
they had put the lippy stick in there
instead of the liquid lipstick I know
this one's prettier but this one is such
better formula this is the ultra satin
lip formula which is better than their
ultra matte lip as far as being dry and
cracking and things like that but this
is not my personal preference for a
liquid lipstick I don't really enjoy
them from colour-pop now that I've tried
lots of liquid lipsticks this is not
something that will ever wear and I
didn't want to swatch it and use it No
I would never wear it beyond this video
so this is gonna go in my giveaway box
for a future giveaway I really like the
Lumiere lippy stick I love it it's
beautiful it's a gorgeous shade so I
would probably like the shade but again
I don't like that formula because it is
very very dry on me not again not as bad
as the matte formula but the satin one
is still too dry for me is this a
fantastic deal no is it a good deal yeah
if you like all of these colors or if
you're a kathleenlights nail polish
collector or if you just really like her
and want to support her I would
definitely recommend picking this up I
do really like the polishes a lot but if
you are just getting these and you don't
care about that it's kathleenlights and
there's only a few of them that you like
in here we definitely recommend getting
them as individuals instead of as the
set I feel like you're gonna be a lot
happier and you're gonna feel like
you've spent your money better and that
way too you can look at other polishes
in her collection she's got some really
gorgeous unique shades in her collection
that you could probably kind of pick and
choose a mix and match which might be
better speaking of that there is a
holiday sale going on right now it's
three polishes for $15 they've got some
curated sets on there you definitely
might want to check those out because
that is a really good deal at five
dollars a Polish I think these are way
worth well more than five dollars a
Polish I think 850 is a fair price for
these I don't think that they're
overpriced at all for the quality of
what you're getting and overall it's
just a really great set and I'm just
very thankful to have been given the
opportunity to try these I will be
looking at buying more Kol polish in the
future do I need more nail polish no I
do not need more nail polish but in when
she makes shades that are very unique to
my collection I will definitely think
about purchasing some in the future
because the quality is very very good I
am now going to turn the conversation
