and first impressions of the Kol polish
winter collection it is called winter
glamour land we're gonna take these out
of the box we're gonna swatch them on my
nails I'm gonna give you my first
impression opinions on them we're gonna
decide together whether these are
accurate to the descriptions on the
website and try to help you make some
decisions on whether these polishes are
right for you or not so if you're
interested in that hang tight we're
gonna get into it right now as you may
have seen last week I did do a full
review of the lips and tips set I did
have some time to play with this so I
could do a full review because these are
holiday kinds of colors I wanted to get
to you as soon as possible since I just
received this a couple of days ago I
didn't have time to fully test he so
we're just doing full at first
impression this is not a full review of
these products but hope they'll be able
to give you some information and help
you decide whether you want to purchase
these or not these were sent to me by KL
polish I'm not being paid for this
review I do not benefit from your
purchase and I do not have a discount
code or affiliate link for you you just
go to the KL polished website in order
to purchase now just a couple of things
about the brand before we get into the
swatches I will put a time stamp right
there if you wanted to skip right to the
swatches you can only purchase kale
polish on kale polish accom they do ship
internationally but there's a list of
excluded countries on their website you
have to check their to see if you live
in one of those countries there's a flat
rate shipping within the US it's for 95
and then Canada's flat rate 895 for the
basic shipping and 1395 for expedited
shipping international shipping outside
the US and Canada is $9.99 one thing
that's really important to know is that
all sales are final from Kayla polish
unless a Polish comes broken from my
review that I did last week someone did
comment that they did have a Polish car
broken and the customer service was
great they did send out new polishes to
replace the ones that were broken and
damaged from the shipping the next thing
you need to know is that Kayla polish is
cruelty free and vegan and made in the
United States on the box it does say
that these are seven free nail polishes
seven free means that they don't include
ingredients that some people do not like
to see in their polishes I'm gonna put
those on the screen for you so you can
read what those are as far as price
point it is the same price as the
in tip set with the lips and tips that
you do get the free colour-pop ultra
satin lip wear this one does not come
with a lip stick the individual polishes
are eight dollars each so you're getting
this last polish for two dollars and
fifty cents for the whole set so if you
just like five of these polishes and not
six I would recommend getting these as
individuals because you will save
yourself a little bit of money you can
also kind of mix and match on the
website if that seems more your style
rather than getting this set but anyway
let's go ahead and get into the actual
swatches so like magic we are going to
have them all laid out for you there
they are
editing magic let's go through the
individual polishes one by one by
description so this is casino night it
is a shimmery gold this is a glitter
polish so this one is one of those where
you kind of have to scrape it off a
little bit to remove it if you know what
I mean if we've ever used that glitter
polish that's the only one in this
collection that's like that next up we
have ace which is a true red then we
have Central Park which is a dark black
and green they say it's a great
alternative to black we're going to talk
about that when we get to the swatches
this one is my favorite it's called
Cassiopeia it's a grey black with
multi-dimensional shimmers oh I love
this which you see this one okay
those aren't just freckles if you look
closely you can see Cassiopeia all right
your story a long time ago in Ethiopia
there was this Queen Cassiopeia who
thought she was the most beautiful woman
in the entire world and there wasn't
anybody in the kingdom who wasn't
offended by this woman's relentless
vanity and one day she really screwed up
and offended the gods I remember what
she did I don't remember who she
offended but it was bad she crossed the
line but anyway beside and to see God
punish Cassiopeia by placing her in the
heavens upside down in her throne stuck
for eternity with her skirt around her
shoulders and all the blood rushing your
ass and then this one here is Mindy it's
a vampy dark berry and then finally we
have Graham which is a slate gray let's
go ahead and start with casino night and
this one I feel like is a typical gold
glitter there really isn't anything that
makes this stand out but it is a good
gold glitter in that there is a lot of
sparkle there it's not a sparse one I
have a couple of drugstore ones that are
really sparse and then I have some that
are really opaque in one coat or this
one you can see your nail and well you
can see my nail through it you can't see
your nail because your nail isn't here
but you can see my nail through it just
a little bit which i think is kind of a
pretty look just with one coat next up
with ace it is a beautiful true red and
you can see how pretty that is
it's almost opaque in one coat if you
have short nails and you don't have this
white strip like I do you might be able
to get away with one coat of that one
move on to Central Park
they do describe this as one that you
can get away with as black uh a screen
it's really really green I would imagine
in the dark from far away it might look
kind of black but in the light it's
pretty green when cassiopi Cassady I
love this one it reminds me of some of
my jewelers that I love that are 14
dollars a piece at full price it's just
such a beautiful beautiful color I don't
know if it's coming off on camera well
but there are some true holographic
sparkles in here that reflect a rainbows
it's really beautiful but you know
depending on the how you shift your nail
I mean I see greens and I see yellows
and I see reds and I see Johnny in the
mirror and I see Suzy in the mirror I'm
just kidding hopefully you got that
reference but yeah I mean depending on
the lighting of this you can it kind of
looks Brown and then other lights it
looks more kind of copper I don't know
it's just such a cool shade I really
like that a lot
and then we have Mindy Mindy is really
beautiful I feel like that the berry
tones the deepness of it isn't coming
off on the monitor as I'm seeing it here
so I'm hoping I can kind of color
correct a little bit so you can see the
true color but the swatch that I put the
color that I put down is what I see on
my nails I want to make sure that you
see what I see
so when you look at the color swatch
that I put with the name that's going to
be an accurate depiction of what I see
on my nails I'm trying to match it up as
I add it and then finally let's put on
ground
and I'm actually really impressed with
Graham because it's almost fully opaque
and usually lighter shades they're not
even close to opaque on the first coat
and I feel like Graham does really
really well
I mean overall I feel like all of these
shades if you have short nails where you
don't have that white strip you might be
able to get away with one coat
kathleenlights I'm kale polish recommend
to do two coats with all of their
polishes so speaking of that let's go
ahead and apply the second coat so you
can see what they all look like with
full opacity
as I put on this last one I just want to
make note of the brush I really do love
the way that the brush fans out as I
apply and also the rounded tip at the
end of course this brush is not unique
to Kol polish there are many other
brands you can find that have this kind
of brush but I do appreciate that kale
polish it uses this type of brush
because it's my personal favorite kind
all right so that's what the shades look
like on my nails with two coats I really
like using a shade like casino nights on
the pinky finger on the ring finger as
an accent nail and then painting my
nails another color that's my favorite
way to wear shades like this not saying
that you can't wear this all over your
nails but for me I think they're kind of
a pain in the butt to take off so I
don't like them all over my nails
because I get annoyed really easily
glitter polishes this one here I think
it's important to note with Cassiopeia
this is not the same even though there
are kind of some flecks of glitter in
there it's very easy to remove just as
these all these polishes are the other
polishes that don't have glitter as I
mentioned before I haven't tried these
polishes beyond swatches of them so I
can give you kind of my opinion of kale
polish overall I do really like the
formula it's very fast drying there are
some things that happen I'm very rough
on my nails so I do have some slight
wear after a couple of days but that's
not enough for me to take it off it
usually takes me at least five or six
days before I'm like alright I'm done
with these polishes they look terrible
and also I did not say this in the
beginning but I am NOT a nail artist the
swatches that you see are not
professional swatches and I am going to
be removing this polish right after this
video is over so just know I didn't wrap
the tip I didn't you know put a top coat
on and because these are coming right
off because I have other things to do
and this looks really weird you know
it's it the purpose of the swatch is
just to show you what they look like all
my nails not to teach you how to paint
nails I I talked about that ad nauseam
in my last kale polish video but I want
to make sure I mentioned it here as well
so hopefully this gave you a little bit
of an idea of whether these polishes are
right for you personally my preferences
are for these polishes my favorites are
Cassiopeia of Cour
and honestly Central Park I really like
a lot because it is unique to my
collection I don't own a deep cream like
this and I do think it's very very
pretty I think this would look beautiful
with some gold nail art and I think I
think that would be just incredible
looking and also save it for st.
Patrick's Day I think that would be fun
too these cut these shades here I don't
find them to be super unique to my
collection I've seen a ton of golds that
are very similar to casino nights I have
red polishes that are very similar to
this Mindy and Graham are a little bit
more unique to my collection but I do
have shades they're similar so if I were
going to purchase this collection I
probably would just purchase these too
personally because they're unique to my
personal collection but that's not to
say that there's anything wrong with the
other ones you have to look at your own
personal collection and your own
personal preferences and decide which
ones are right for you if any at all so
