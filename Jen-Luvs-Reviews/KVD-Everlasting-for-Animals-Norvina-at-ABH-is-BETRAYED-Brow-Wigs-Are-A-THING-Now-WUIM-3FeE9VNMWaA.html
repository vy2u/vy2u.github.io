Asya feels the sting and brow eggs yep
Vera Singh I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what's been makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and makeup for
May 21st 2017 let's get started with the
top industry news Kat Von D announced
this week that she is releasing four new
shades of the popular everlasting liquid
lipstick which has been dubbed the Farm
Sanctuary collection and she'll be
naming the first shade the one in this
photo Hilda
after the very first animal rescued by
farm Sanctuary in 1986 KVD said I think
he'll it'll will universally look
amazing on all skin tones watch their
Instagram page or our daily makeup
minute here at Chad loves reviews for
sneak peeks of the collection as they
are released in March we brought you the
news that almost hacia Beverly Hills was
working on a sister palette to the
modern renaissance although a BH was not
ready to disclose the details of the
palette it seems that someone betrayed
the trust and the non-disclosure
agreement they were given and posted
pics on reddit needless to say this did
not sit well with the president of ABH
Claudius or aka nor Vina nor Vina took
to Twitter after the leak stating the
sensationalism of leaking product is
irresponsible I work myself to create
the best products I can who are you to
ruin the reveal nor Vina also posted a
pic of the reddit post along with this
statement I wake up to a text from a
friend asking me if we showed this
palette yet I wonder why she or he
sought it within their right to ruin
this for me
it seems the poster to Reddit even
disclosed how she obtained the palette
with the caption a friend of mine works
for a BH and snag new one
hot off the presses another message from
noir vana stated you got your friend in
trouble because we will know by the end
of the day today where they came from
the retailer signed a non-disclosure so
they will be new clear about this since
breaking a non-disclosure make you as
bad as noir Vina once the picture is out
there do you feel that blogs and
Instagram accounts have the right to
repost it let us know what you think in
the comments below
celebrity makeup artist Joyce Benelli No
for working with the kardashians has
announced that she is launching her own
makeup line but as many companies do it
hit a snag at a complete do-over with
another manufacturer with necessary the
new line will consist of a few products
to start off and it looks like the stand
out is for brow gel the line is
currently marked to release in fall
around September October just in time
for the holiday season's brow trends are
something that seem to be popping up
every day lately fix and bushy colored
feather just about any way you can
imagine well maybe not every way ever
looked in the mirror and thought I need
a wig for my brow yes they exist observe
in a reposted video on Hung Vuong goes
Instagram you see someone being fitted
from brow wigs and getting them applied
so no it's probably not a common item
but it's a great idea for some wanting
to try out a pair there are affordable
options would you do this let us know in
