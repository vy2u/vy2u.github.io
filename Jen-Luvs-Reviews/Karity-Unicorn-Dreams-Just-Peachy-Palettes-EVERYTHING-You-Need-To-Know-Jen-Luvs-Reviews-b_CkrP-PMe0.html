2 eyeshadow palette today we've got two
products from the brands carroty we've
got their unicorn dreams palette and
they're just peachy palette they just
came out not too terribly long ago and I
really want to share my thoughts with
you so I'm about to do that right about
now in case you have never heard of
caridy they are an indie makeup brand
and I know a lot of people are kind of
swaying oh right away from the
mainstream brands right now because
either they're good or they just want to
try something different they want to
support an independent brand in these
palettes you get 15 I shadow Xand they
are $25 charity is a cruelty free brand
they are also vegan and they are paraben
free these pallets were designed in the
United States but they were not made in
the United States they were made in the
PRC also known as the People's Republic
of China the brand that I use a lot that
the products are made in the People's
Republic of China are the juvie s place
eye shadow palette so that goes to show
that just because it is made in China
doesn't mean that it is necessarily bad
quality that is a common misconception
about products made in China they are to
people some people automatically think
that it's gonna be bad quality so don't
throw it out because you think it's
gonna be bad but if you only buy
products made in the USA then this is
definitely not gonna be a product for
you you get 19 point five grams of
product in here and like I said they are
25 dollars each which makes them a
dollar 28 per gram which is really
inexpensive it's definitely way less
expensive than a Sephora brand these are
basically drugstore eyeshadow prices
each pan is 1.3 grams I forgot to
mention that ingredient wise they are
talc based eyes shadow palettes they
also have FX or palmitate in them some
people are allergic to at the hexyl
palmitate and some people don't buy
products with ethics or palmitate due to
environmental reasons there is mica in
here people were telling me in my last
video that I did that there are some
child labor concerns with mica I don't
know very much about that but if that's
something that bothers you there is mica
in here that is the second ingredient
also phenoxyethanol is the preservative
in here and some people are sensitive to
that just like some people are sensitive
to parabens
some people like to dab eyeshadow onto
their lips to give a different look you
don't want to do that with either of
these eyeshadow palettes because the
pigments in here a lot of them are not
lips safe for example chromium hydroxide
greens ultramarines ferric ferrocyanide
and chromium oxide greens are in this
and then in this one in the peach one
we've got chromium oxide greens and
chromium hydroxide greens and
ultramarine blue in these so you do not
want to use these on your lips but other
than that they're very much a typical
eyeshadow formula there's anything that
stands out as being especially unique or
different in these they're relatively
typical you know Kailen magnesium
stearate things like that that are in a
lot of eyeshadows so now let's look at
the individual palettes let's start with
unicorn dreams because that's what I
have on my eyes today I am gonna also
show you a look with the Just Peachy
palette this is all you know it looks
like a unicorn
it's very unicorn like we've got the
malls which is what I'm wearing on my
eyes today we've got purples we've got
blues we've got greens and then we've
got some kind of grays and whites over
here a little bit of brown and the just
peachy palette we're looking at very
similar shades to a lot of the warm
toned palettes that have been coming out
lately we've got shades of brown orange
red and cream tan kinds of colors in
here speaking of the colors I'm gonna go
ahead and show you swatches of both
palettes right now unfortunately I
wasn't able to get my friends to come
over to swatch these with me it is a lot
of swatches it takes a lot of time to
swatch all of this so we're just gonna
see it on my light skin tone and I'm
sorry about that but the carroty
cosmetics website I'll put up some
photos right now they have swatches on
different skin tones that you can check
out over there but you can also see them
right here I'm showing them to you in
case you're curious so we're gonna go
ahead and do some finger swatches and
brush swatches and I'm gonna show you
those right now all right this is the
Unicorn dreams palette I really love the
outer packaging on this with the hollow
Unicorn it's super cute and here are the
shades inside very unicorny let's go
ahead and start out with pure spark
gallop and a sky now pure really does
perform just like that on the eye I was
so sad about this because I felt like
it's got so much potential I wanted to
show you I did try this
with a synthetic flat shader brush it
does not swatch well with that so I went
back to old reliable and ended up using
my fluffier shader brush instead because
I just wanted to show you that this this
flat shader brush does not work I need
to get a different one and that's on me
but it's coming coming soon but until
then we're gonna use the brushes that I
like which are the a little bit fluffier
brushes you can see that spark really
does have a nice shine to it not super
opaque but it does have a nice shine
moving on to gallop a little powdery
there but you can get a nice shade and
sky same thing a little bit powdery but
again you can get a nice shade you just
kind of have to pack and build and pack
and build in order to get it to be that
bright blue that you can see in the
finger swatch and if you're new to my
channel you are new to the white test
and this is supposed to simulate a long
day of wear or if you rub your eye to
see whether the shades will stain your
skin and as you can see only sky and
pure really stick around through wiping
them off let's move on to the next for
mystical secret main and believer and
you can see mystical is gorgeous it is
definitely one of the strongest shades
in this palette it's beautiful
secret doesn't brush swatch nearly as
well but you can pack it onto the lid
with a fingertip and get a gorgeous look
with main again not as strong as
mystical but still very nice and I
really do like believer a lot as well
but you are going to get the most punch
with that fingertip you're gonna see
this as a theme kind of through this
palette but if you like a less punchy
look it really is going to be for you
but if you like that really really
strong bright color this palette may not
perform exactly the way you like and
wiping them off you'll see that this for
the set of four it really does do better
as far as staining the lids which means
that chances are you're going to have a
longer wear time with these for them
with the first the next set of for our
fairytale Noah hooves and magical and
you'll notice right away that Fairy Tail
is probably my least favorite shape the
palette and Noah really isn't that much
different on the skin it was quite
disappointing to see them next to each
other and being like what I had used
Noah a little bit on the eye and really
liked it so I was sad when I saw Fairy
Tail was so so similar I hadn't used
that one on the eye yet whose also brush
swatches really badly magical is like
the last set of four where you are gonna
get the most punch with a fingertip
rather than a brush or if you have
different brushes than me they may work
better than mine but we're all really
not impressed with Fairy Tail at all no
one hooves do perform a little bit
better on the eye than what you're
seeing here but they are going to give
you a little bit lighter up a look and
then the white test you probably could
have predicted this magical is the only
one that sticks around my favorite shade
in the palette coming up sparkle I
really love this shade it's absolutely
beautiful it reminds me a lot of a shade
that's in the tart make believe in your
self palette it's very very beautiful on
its own and also as a topper you're
gonna see that in the demo portion in
just a minute
forbidden has a little bit of sparkle in
the undertone but you really can't see
it too much on the eye unless you pack
it on all by itself
forest is a nice shade but you can see
it looks much deeper in the pan that it
does on the skin so just be aware of
that I had really high hopes for
forbidden because it did look quite
unique but unfortunately it does kind of
fall flat and with the white test they
all hang out there a little bit for us
it's definitely the strongest probably
due to it just being a deeper shade
let's go ahead and move on to the Just
Peachy palette I'll tell you right now I
do like the formulas of these shadows
just a little bit better than the
unicorn Dreams palette but the shades
are more typical to what we're seeing in
the market right now first at a 4-hour
glow up creamy princess and totally
sweep glow up is a beautiful highlight
shade I really like it a lot and
princess is probably my favorite shade
in this palette it is absolutely
gorgeous both in the swatch and on the
eye I haven't used totally sweet on the
eye yet but it is beautiful in the
swatch
creamy doesn't do as well with the brush
but you can see that princess really
does do well with the brush it really is
a gorgeous gorgeous shade I love it
totally sweet also does pretty well with
a brush swatch I'm really looking
forward to using that one actually on my
eye it's one of the ones I haven't used
on the eye yet
and with the white test you really see
how good princess really is and totally
sweet a creamy and glow-up are gone now
we've got yummy freshly picked cobbler
and warm and fuzzy
I'm still working on my camera focusing
issue I'm gonna keep trying to do better
every single time but I will make sure
that you get to see everything fully
focused Yummie is a gorgeous shade I do
feel like it's one of the stronger
formulas in here freshly picked is also
very very functional and great for a
matte cream color cobbler kind of falls
flat on the brush swatch but again
packing on the lid it is very nice same
thing with warm and fuzzy definitely
better packing on to the lid rather than
with a brush but if you like a lighter
look again warm and fuzzies gonna be
just fine with a brush I really like
cobbler as a shade I find it to be one
of the more unique shades in the palette
because it does have a little bit of a
gold shift to it and with the white test
you see that yummy and warm and fuzzy
are the ones that hang out the longest
delicious M nom I love that name Atlanta
and juicy are the next for delicious is
another wonderful shade in the palette I
haven't used um Nam on the eyes yet
either but I'm really looking forward to
using that one because the swatches will
be really pretty
delicious you can see that's another one
that's gonna pack better on with a
fingertip oh I forgot about this brush
swatch nom nom did not do well with a
brush wha-wha-wha I did go back in to
see if it would build and it does build
a bit but again that one's gonna be a
fingertip one I haven't used that one on
the eyes yet Atlanta is a beautiful
matte shade that one is really really
good I've used that as a transition
crease color quite a few times and I
really like it a lot and juicies also a
pretty good one it does build further
than what you're seeing here and I do
really like that shade it's a nice one
I wish there was a little bit more
difference between amnon and juicy you
can see that they're really not that
different from each other wish there was
a little more variation there oh how to
focus in focus
white test here all of them do really
really well lasting power on this
palette is actually a little bit better
than the unicorn dreams palette Organic
sliced up and fruity sliced up is one of
my absolute favorite shades in the
palette it is gorgeous really easy to
work with it isn't as dark as I hoped it
would be on the eye but it still is a
really nice shade
and fruity again is not as dark as I
hoped would be when looking at it in the
pan it's really difficult to build this
up to a deep shade so just be aware of
that that the deep shades in here really
aren't super deep if you want a smokier
look or if you prefer darker shades on
your eyes
this may not perform the way that you
want it to and the white test you can
see they all hang in there really really
well like I said a minute ago I do feel
like the lasting power on Just Peachy is
a little bit better than unicorn dreams
now that you have seen the swatches I'm
gonna go ahead and show you the two
looks that I did the one that I'm
wearing now with unicorn dreams and then
also a look with the Just Peachy palette
alright my friend this look is going to
be with the unicorn dreams palette we're
gonna start with the Ulta eye primer in
the shade nude matte this is a super fab
dupe for the Urban Decay primer potion
in Eden it's not exactly the same I feel
like Eden is just a little bit better
but if you don't want to spend that kind
of money and you want something close
this is definitely a good option
Carrie D did send me some brushes so
we're going to be using a few of these
they sent me there a 20-7 brush which is
like an angled kind of fluffy brush they
sent me the e30 which is like a pointed
blending ish brush and then a blending a
31 brush go ahead and do well there's
only one matte skin tone color in here
as you're gonna see in a minute this
palette does lean light so I wish that
they had included one more lighter
transition shade in there something else
matte
so this transition shade is a little bit
deep for me but I'm not going to
complain you just kind of have to use a
really light hand if you're my skin tone
if you were a little deeper than me this
will probably be pretty perfect because
of the shade selection in here and I
really do just want to use this palette
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna dip in
with their each 27 brush and I'm just
gonna try to deepen up the outer corner
just a little bit just to build up the
intensity of it and hopefully use that
to deepen up and it is working that's
actually quite nice and with my eye
shape I like to go up into the crease
with a deeper color because I feel like
that makes my eyelid pop even more and
then it just stays more diffused on the
brow bone these colors kind of match the
shirt I'm wearing so we're just gonna go
super monochromatic today and I'm gonna
go in with hooves which is kind of a
satin finish and we're gonna use my
devious place brush this is just it just
says judy is on it doesn't have a number
and just pack that all over the lid
I do want to show you some of these
shimmer shades though so we are going to
top that with magical which is this
shimmery shade here and I personally
prefer to apply shimmer shades like this
with my fingertips you can also use a
flat synthetic brush if you like but
that is not my personal preference so
we're not going to do it let's stick
this in the center of the eye right in
the middle I'm gonna take the shade
secret here again with my fingertip and
put this on the outer corner you can
actually also use a sponge tip
applicator for this but I don't really
like the way those feel you might know
that I'm a texture kind of person I
don't like the way the sponge tip
applicator feel I don't feel like these
shades are blending together super nice
so I'm gonna go back into the magical
shade the pink shade that I put in the
middle and kind of blare it just a
little bit more but there really isn't a
whole lot of contrast between these two
shades well let's add some with the
shade Sparkle I have used this one
multiple times and this is my favorite
shade in the palette and I'm going to
tap that in the inner corner of the eye
there is no matte cream color in there
so I'm just gonna dip into the Just
Peachy palette by carroty and swirl my
brush in that this is the shape freshly
picked and just kind of hit up the brow
bone just a little bit I do want to show
you something that's really cool you can
leave a look just like this if you want
to but I want to show you how awesome
the shade Sparkle is what I'm gonna do
is I'm actually gonna lay this over top
of the entire look kind of like a
shimmer topper and just kind of show you
how it just brings the rest of the
colors to life see how it doesn't
overpower it it just kind of brightens
everything just to make sure that my
crease color really is deep I'm gonna go
back into forest just a little bit and
just make sure that I haven't covered
too much of that Brown with the pink
choose the shade forbidden on the lower
lash line it's kind of it's a mom with
like gold sparkle in it and I'm really
curious how that's gonna look on the
lower lash line
that's pretty alright I'm gonna go ahead
and do the rest of my face and I will be
right back I realized after I was done
filming that I completely forgot to come
back and show you the finished look with
liner and lashes this is just a clip
from my everyday people contouring
tutorial so hopefully you can get a good
idea from this as far as how the look
came out with liner and lashes as a
complete look now we're gonna go ahead
and move on to the Just Peachy demo
alright y'all ready for look number two
we are going to dip into the Just Peachy
palette and this time we're gonna be
using the Kat Von D eye primer because
it is quite a different formula then
let's say the Urban Decay primer potion
and the Ulta brand the Too Faced shadow
insurance this one is quite a different
formula so let's go ahead and rub this
one on I do like this one because it
does mute out some discoloration so it
just got in the mail the new Moda
mythical brushes so I figured you would
get into them and try them for the first
time I almost don't even want to use
them because they're just too stinkin
pretty so let's just take out the eye
brushes alright let's start with
transition
and we will start with let's do Atlanta
for a transition ever feel like yours
having a bad face day like that's the
way I'm feeling right now you see that
matte shade really blends out very
evenly and very nicely this is called a
shader brush it's a little fluffier than
the shader brushes I normally use but
that's okay we'll work with it so let's
do princess I'm a firm believer that the
eyeshadow palette should perform better
with some eyeshadow brushes than others
but overall you should be able to use
any eyeshadow brush to get a decent look
out of a palette if you have to use
special brushes for it I am NOT a fan of
that so I'm just gonna pop princess in
the center of my lid
let's do juicy this one right here not
sure if that's dark enough that is not
what I'm going for it's not dark enough
so let's go into sliced-up instead there
we go that's better and I'm going to
punch that in the inner corner as well
interesting alright let's go ahead and
let's go into warm and fuzzy and let's
get that a little bit on the brow bone
up here
I'm gonna go in with my fingertip back
into princess and pop that again right
in the center see I really like these so
much better with a fingertip and you may
be able to find a flat shader brush that
you really like with this alright we're
gonna do sliced up on the outer corner
again so make sure that's nice and
punchy and then in the inner corner oh I
like that I definitely like the way the
shades in this palette apply better than
the Unicorn palette I feel like that
just there's more hits the shadows that
I really like in the Unicorn palette I
feel like there's more of that formula
in here that foiled formula that I love
okay I'm gonna go in with this liner
brush and go in with this fruity shade
you just really define out here I'm
gonna just tap this one just very
lightly in there and just really try to
build up this outer corner I'm gonna
actually use that shade this fruity
shade as my liner today I'm going to dip
in with that liner brush and I'm gonna
spray it with some fix+
not sure if I like that I don't think
it's dark enough
yeah that's not dark enough I'm gonna
have to go in with regular liner so
we'll just do Nyx's epic ink liner and
just kind of go over top of it
oh I just got an idea okay now that I've
got that black down I want to try to go
on top of it with the sliced up shade
the shimmery Brown see if I can get with
a deep shimmery shade hmm that's pretty
here we go that is exactly what I was
looking for there we go
and we'll do again we'll go into fruity
this one down here kind of pop that
there weren't weren't wet and then we'll
do a little bit of glow up on the lower
lash line to brighten if you like the
inner corner isn't really haloing let's
try it let's pop that in again because I
feel like it's not doing what I want it
to do it's just not super deep
okay going back in with princess just a
little bit in the center to make sure
I've really got that pop that I want and
if some goes over my eyeliner at this
point it doesn't really matter because
I've already got that shimmer on there
so now we're just gonna go in with
freshly-picked which is the matte cream
shade and just kind of do a little brow
bone highlight and then we will do
mascara and then we'll be done this is
the essence lash princess false lash
effect mascara it is definitely one of
my favorite mascaras of all time it is
getting a little bit old I need to re-up
on it soon but it still does a really
nice job we're doing those super light
on the rest of the makeup today I'm just
gonna put a little bit of my Sephora
concealer
and a little bit of benefits gala for
Nia blush to kind of go with that peachy
theme
and this lipstick is from a brand called
color the world and this is the shade
Huntress my friend Nancy bought me a few
of these to try and I really like this
formula it's super creamy and that's
where I'm gonna leave the look today I
think people think that you need to do
highlighter and bronzer and contour
every single day but you really really
don't I know some of you don't do that
every single day but some people do and
just so you know I don't either I
sometimes I just want to do blush and I
don't want to deal with the rest of it
and today is one of those days so this
is the finished look I hope that you
like it and now onto the rest of the
review so now it is time for my full
review of these two palettes here so
let's go ahead and start with the
unicorn dreams palette okay uh okay
there are some good things about this
palette I really love this shade Sparkle
I feel like it's a really nice top or
over the other shades I did a really
beautiful look for what's up and makeup
this past week where I use magical and
gallop and then I use sparkle to kind of
bring it all together and it really
looked beautiful I was very happy with
that look there definitely some things I
feel like could be improved in this
palette the big thing is that there's a
lot of light tones in here as you may
have noticed with the swatches a lot of
these colors are very light so if you
have a medium to deeper skin tone this
may be a supplemental palette for you
these two shades here sky and Mystikal
really aren't that different on the skin
so I personally would have put in a
different shade other than one of those
there also aren't enough matte colors to
really bring this look together we've
got one deep brown and forest we have no
matte cream colors I just I feel like
this is definitely a supplemental
palette for really anybody the
pigmentation on this is just okay it's
definitely not a really bright poppy
bold eyeshadow palette so if you like
something more subtle like maybe the
original Too Faced palettes like the
chocolate bar palette the bon bons
palette I feel like the pigmentation of
these is similar to those in that it'll
provide a light lighter wash of color
rather than like a jus vyas place where
it's going to be like BAM Instagram in
your face so if you want to try some
color
you're a little scared of something as
bold as juvie this place this may be a
place that you could go and feel
comfortable with it you know adding a
little bit of mystical on the lower
lashline with the neutral look or using
mystical as eyeliner or you know just
adding a little bit of sparkle over top
of your nude eye look something like
that I mean they are beautiful colors
but I do feel like it's not as poppy as
I personally enjoy I do feel like that
starting off with pure I feel like pure
was a great idea and it's like this gray
with this pink shift but it just doesn't
come through the shade just doesn't
perform and that made me really sad
because I was very excited when I saw
what that was and then once i swatched
it once I tried to use it it was kind of
like a it really fell flat for me which
I'm very sad about some of the matte
shades are a little bit powdery
especially the blues I'm not a big fan
of those I feel like this is worth you
know maybe the $25 price point but I
definitely wouldn't pay more than $25
for this palette it is good for the
right person meaning someone it doesn't
like a super punchy I look but wants to
try some colors but if you really like
us very very pigmented you know really
bold eye this palette I don't think is
going to be for you on the other hand
the just peachy palette I feel like the
foiled shades in here are a lot more
punchy which is my personal taste to be
you know really bold really bright
really foiled and I feel like you get
that more in the formula here I wish the
uniforms rooms was like this because I
know that people are really really tired
of palettes at this point that are these
peachy kinds of shades this did come out
during the middle of all of that when
these were really really hyped up and I
do feel like the lasting power on these
is better than the unicorn dreams I feel
like the unicorn dreams is kind of
muddied and faded by about the eight to
ten hour mark where I feel like this one
can hold its color a bit more whereby
the eight hour mark you've still got a
little bit of separation of color by the
10 mark there 10 hour mark they're
pretty muddy but this one's definitely
better than the other one if I were
gonna say to purchase one or the other
of these if you like the same kinds of
eyeshadows that I like which are really
pigmented eyeshadows I would definitely
pick the just peachy over the unicorn
dreams the mattes in here
are more consistently good easier to
work with but again we're where I know
that a lot of people already purchased a
lot of pallets like this so I can see
where some people this may not be for
them but if you are interested in a
peach tone pallet and you don't have
these swiming in your collection and
this may be one that you want to
consider
I definitely think $25 is a great price
for this one this one I would pay maybe
a little bit more maybe upwards to $30
for this but probably not more than $30
for this pallet so on my personal
opinion honestly I probably wouldn't
purchase this this isn't one that is
fits my taste as far as the punchiness
of the shadows and the shades in it and
it be not being a complete palette but
this is one that I would probably
purchase if I didn't already own a bunch
of shades like this I would probably
purchase it but since I do I probably
wouldn't have purchased either of these
oh my gosh but I have to be honest with
you about how I feel and you may feel
