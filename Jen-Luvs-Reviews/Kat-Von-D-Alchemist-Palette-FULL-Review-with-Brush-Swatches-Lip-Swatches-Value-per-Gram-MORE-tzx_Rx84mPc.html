review on the Kat Von D alchemists
palette this has been highly requested
on the channel and I am so thankful to
have this once again thanks to my friend
Nancy who ordered this when they had the
accidental presale and said it to me
which was so nice of her Thank You Nancy
for saying this to me I really
appreciate it in case you do not know my
reviews are very long they have lots of
information so feel free to you to skip
ahead a buttons down below to get to the
sections that you are most interested in
let's go ahead and jump into this
palette and everything you need to know
so the first thing you need to know is
it is formulated without parabens
sulfates or phthalates it is lip face
and eye safe it is cruelty free
sephora.com has this quote is completely
free of animal derived ingredients and
Kat Von D Beauty has it listed as hash
tag vegan alert it does not say
specifically this product is vegan but
it has those things on there that lead
me to believe that this product is vegan
it is currently sold out on the sephora
website I don't believe it was available
for very long it is listed as coming
soon on Kat Von D's website so if you're
interested in purchasing this you can
sign up for an email alert when this
does become available over there it is
sold in Sephora stores I did call my
local store to see if it was in stock
and it did sell out last week they do
have a truck coming in but they're not
sure if more of these will be on the
truck so check your local Sephora to see
whether it's available in store says
this palette is seven years in the
making it is one of Kat Von D's passion
products she spent months perfecting the
intricate letter A and the decorative
scrollwork featured on the front of the
palette so let's talk about what
actually comes in here so you get four
pans of iridescent highlighter shade it
does come with a triangular shaped
mirror that is about a centimeter away
from the edge of the packaging it is a
cardboard packaging with magnetic
closure but it does have a smooth
plastic key kind of outside like it's
been dipped in some kind of plastic this
is something that is not going to
collect dirt super easily and
just because of the slip of the plastic
so if you're worried about fingerprints
and smudges on packaging this is
actually a really good one on the back
of his alchemists holographic palette
face and eye highlighter palette it does
mention that there are four pans in here
at one point five three grams of piece
inside you do get the four shades you
get an emerald sapphire violet amethyst
and an opal so green blue purple and
pink they're so talking about value
we're looking at four the four panned at
1.5 three grams each which is six point
one two grams total $32 for this palette
divided by the six point one two grams
leads to five dollars and twenty three
cents per gram which is obnoxiously
expensive it's really really overpriced
for what you get in here as far as price
per gram if you compare that to her
metal matte palette which was less than
$2 per gram a product in the middle
matte I just don't get it maybe because
she put so much love into it I don't
know maybe it's just calculated by the
number of hours she worked on that I
don't know but it's ridiculously
expensive for a Kat Von D product
speaking of this one I put pictures of
swatches of this up on my Instagram make
sure you're following me on Instagram
for sneak peeks of swatches of products
that I'm going to review I got asked
about the anasazi of glow kit in moon
child how does it compare them well no
i'll known that palette well my friend
is shawni over at total makeup junkie
101 does own both and she did a full
review of both of them and did side by
side to watch comparisons I will link a
Shaunie's video down below I will also
link a blog post that I found if you're
more of a blog kind of person the blog
is called our beauty cult calm there are
swatches on that blog as well did they
take away that I took from both the
Shawnee and the blog is that the big
difference between this and the
moonchild palette is that the moonchild
palette has chunkier glitters in it it's
not as smooth of a formula where this is
very very smooth and there's no actual
glitter in it which makes this one a
little more attractive to me personally
so let's go ahead without further ado
let me go ahead and show you the Swan
watches of this palette so you can see
for yourself how it performs on the skin
right here is the outside of the
alchemists palette it really is pretty
when the light catches it you can really
see that holographic look on the outside
now looking in the pan you really can't
tell that much of a difference between
the shades until you start squashing
them so these are the finger swatches
the first one is the green the second is
the blue the third is the violet and the
fourth is the pink now next to those I'm
going to do brush swatches this is the
Real Techniques bold metals eyeshadow
brush I really love it for packing on
color so that's why I use this brush
there's lots of brushes you can use for
squatches this is just my favorite
personally I feel like they go on very
nicely with a brush I don't see much
difference between a brush and the
finger swatches I decided to do also a
blush brush since these can also be used
for a highlight so that is the way it
applies with a fluffier blush brush and
I really like the way that these apply
up and these swatches you can't really
see too much difference between the blue
and the green but on the eyes you really
can it tell quite a bit of difference if
you're looking if you're from far away
you might not be able to tell the
difference between the blue and the
green on the eye or the cheeks but
there's definitely a difference between
the purple and the pink so now that you
have seen the arm swatches that it's
watched over no primer I just put
straight onto my arm I do want to show
you some lip swatches as well to show
you how this applies to the lips go
ahead and show you those swatches right
now now for me the most fun way to use
these is actually on the lip now this is
the brand new liquid lipstick by Kat Von
D called centuary she's coming out with
a brand new line of liquid lipsticks and
this is the first one that she did a
pre-release on I just fell in love with
the color swatch online so I bought it
and I honestly don't think it looks as
spectacular on my lips as it did on the
model but I still really like it so this
is the example of the way that these
look over
a deep brown shades that trendy 90's
loft logical have deep brown let's I am
going to show you also over red and over
nude so let's start with the emerald
this is going to give you that green
Brown look that you may like insert an
eyeshadow that looks a little crazy
right now
the little Tyrone Biggums ish right now
but it's going to get better I promise
this liquid lipstick is quite dry so I
press my lips together it doesn't really
blend nicely so what I did that I
grabbed my blistex deep renewal and just
put that over top and I feel like that
kind of meld the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick in with the highlighter and I
feel like that really is necessary with
a dry liquid lipstick to put some kind
of lip balm or lip gloss over top now
going into the blue here just I think
provides a really neat look this is the
blue Brown a kind of look that you might
get from some eyeshadows Kat Von D
actually did a blue brown eyeshadow and
it was gorgeous but it's just a fun way
to put it on the lips and again it's not
blending very well into the lip so using
that lip balm really does make a
difference of bringing it together the
highlighter doesn't last longer than the
lip product which is really nice now
watch what happens when I put the violet
shade on create a really neat effect one
thing I noticed about the violet shade
though is it tensity a little more
powdery than the other shades when apply
to the lips you get more chunks and that
happens with every single one of these
swatches where you do see a little more
powder enos but then when you take that
lip balm and you put it over top you
really I mean it just brings it all
together and it's just this gorgeous
holographic purple shade I mean I just
really love the dimension in this
combination you know we're going to look
at the pink and I feel like this one is
if there is such a thing the most
natural of the three and the most
everyday wearable for some limits
looking for something less dramatic
again another just powdery powdery
powdery because this liquid lipstick is
so dry so definitely recommend a lip
gloss or a lip balm over top
bring them together and you'll see how
that comes out and I think I'm going to
wear this one all the time I think is so
gorgeous it just makes me happy in my
heart this color now moving on to the
red this is Bare Minerals holiday Jen
nude lipstick I did put a little bit of
concealer over my lips and just make
sure all that Brown was gone this one is
a very soft liquid lipstick it doesn't
dry down to completely dry it's very
hydrating it's just a beautiful creamy
liquid lipsticks formula I want to show
you the way these highlighters melded
with a creamier liquid lipstick so you
can see the difference in just how it
might apply with other products that you
have this is the green next with the
vibe which you think would probably look
pretty creepy and right now it does look
creepy but wait till you see if blood is
in it is a really cool looking and then
neat so now I'm going to put the lip
balm over top of it and I just think
it's so pretty I would never have
thought but green and red together to
come out something like this but it
really brings the yellow tones out of
the highlighter which I really like now
going into the blue shade and of course
this is going to give you that blue
toned red you know it's just it'll
really accentuate that blue in the red
emily bring it out and give you that
pinky blue tone red look and it's so
pretty I love it it really came out
quite pink they're actually now the
violet wait till you see the violet oh
my goodness and you can see those chunks
coming up as well and just how chunky
that ended but just the idea it looks
like it's a black light doesn't it
doesn't it look like straight out of a
black light in a dance club I mean
looked unbelievable the way the red
pairs with with the violet it's just so
pretty
and then finally the pink opal with the
red eye kind of brings it down actually
and kind of gives it a little more of a
peachy tone rather than too bright
ultraviolet kind of shade and again I do
feel like this one is kind of the most
quote wearable kind of interpretation of
the red with these highlighters now
moving into the nude I wanted to use a
drugstore product so this is daringly
nude by Maybelline it's not my favorite
nude in the world but it was the one
that I found and I've used it quite a
bit and I do like it but I'm not a
hundred percent sure how much I like the
way that it meshes with these colors I
think you just have to have the right
eye look with them but isn't that kind
of cool the way that that looks I think
when we put the balm over top it
definitely helps to bring it together
but I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of
this color on me but maybe really really
pretty on somebody else again same thing
with the blue I'm not sure if I'm a huge
fan of the blue with this nude shade
either but again with the right eye look
the right person could really pull this
off
now we start getting to the ones that I
like the best the ultraviolet on top of
the moon came out really really pretty
just kind of brought a Kleck city to it
and just kind of a wildness to it and it
really just showed that violet color I
can see this is being a beautiful
springtime lipstick and then finally of
course my favorite the pink opal really
brings out the peach tunes in it and
again I feel like this one's my favorite
and I feel like this one is the most
quote wearable with the pink opal now
that you've seen how it applies both to
the skin and to the lips let's go ahead
and jump into ingredient analysis this
is where I look on Environmental Working
Group org and see whether there's any
harmful harsh chemicals in this harmful
and/or harsh and or nasty and or gross
Kat Von D being vegan being cruelty free
it typically doesn't have junk in it but
there are quite a few ingredients in
here for people with sensitive skin that
you may want to watch out for I do
whenever I do these reviews I feel like
I'm just flipping this thing around like
way via palette and I am first three
ingredients I'm not going to go into
detail about because I talk about them
in pretty much every single video I will
link down below more information about
these so the first one is how the second
one is at the hexyl palmitate and the
third one is phenoxyethanol just know
that they can all be irritant to some
people the next one is dink oxide it is
a two to three on Environmental Working
Group ten being the worst one being the
best
it is a colorant and it's only in
sapphire it can be used as a sunscreen
and some product I would imagine not in
this product one or more animal studies
show allergenic affects at very low
doses to study shows persistent and
bioaccumulation in a wildlife and
there's some evidence that it's harmful
if it's inhaled just so you know don't
snort your blue sapphire okay it's not a
good idea so if you find that you're
sensitive just to the blue shaded he
it is probably the zinc oxide that you
are sensitive to the next one is
potassium sorbate it is a three it's
also a preservative there's strong
evidence of being a human skin toxin or
allergen by the cosmetic ingredient
review assessments which is a us-based
research company also tocopherol acetate
which is also a three that is a skin
conditioning agent it's a form of
vitamin E their strong evidence that it
is a human skin toxin or allergen truth
and aging actually said that it is a
skin sensitizer that can instigate
immune system responses such as itching
burning scaling hives and blistering of
skin I would imagine that would be in a
higher concentration so really and truly
if you have sensitive skin you may want
to skip this pout because there are so
many ingredients in here that can be
allergens for people if you've never had
problems being allergic to cosmetics
before you'll probably be absolutely
fine with this and again don't snort the
blue now as far as my full review of
this palette I have to tell you I really
do enjoy it I did not want to enjoy it
but I really did enjoy it but I do feel
like this is for a very special group of
people that will enjoy it if you'll go
to work and you wearing nude makeup
looks and you know you're kind of a
natural kind of person you don't really
go out of your comfort zone much don't
bother it's up for you this was not made
for you my friend this is made for
people that really like that shimmer and
shine really like to go out of the box
with iridescent putting iridescent on
the lids on the lips on the cheeks this
is not for the average everyday person
that's just casual makeup user this is
for someone that really likes fun unique
looks I love putting this on my lips it
is such a fun way to spice up my entire
lip collection and it's so fun to play
with it's very enjoyable
I love how finely milled it is I love
how it applies the only critique as far
as the performance of this is the
lasting power the lasting power is not
great especially on the cheeks the
cheeks it does not last me longer than
five or six hours before it is
completely gone as far as its lasting
power on the lips it tends to fade with
whatever lip product you're wearing so
if you have a longer last
lip product it will probably last longer
than if you have a less loss
longer-lasting lip products one thing
that I find with a lot of lip toppers is
that sometimes they'll hang around pass
the lipstick and leave this weird look
this does not do that it tends to fade
away kind of blend in with the product
and go away along with it now as far as
on the eyes it does laughs I feel like
the longest on the eyes I feel like it
will get you through a good solid school
or work day but it will not last you
into the night you're going to have to
reapply but I mean overall I'm really
having fun with this I do feel it is
overpriced for what you get but it is
super fun and I am really thankful to
have it I wish that she either given
more product or she had knocked down the
price by about five bucks then I feel
like it would have been in a more of a
fair price range so I want to thank you
