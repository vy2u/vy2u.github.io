cuz I'm kind of scrubbing it today in my
dinosaur shirt my love came when I did a
project with some fourth graders where
they had to each research a dinosaur and
then I fell in love with Dinosaurs I
think they are so stinking cool so this
is my t-rex shirt I got this at forever
21 I know I'm probably a little old to
shop in forever 21 but love my
sweatshirt but my point is I feel like
I'm scrubbing in a little bit for such a
fancy schmancy palette but I really
wanted to show you this because it is
pretty new it came out about a month ago
I've been playing with it a lot and I
wanted to show you this and give you my
opinions of it so I'm gonna go ahead and
insert the swatches of this right now
so those were the swatches and I'm not
gonna go through and describe each one
because you all have fantastic eyes and
you'll be able to see exactly what's in
that palette and this palette from the
swatches a general opinions I think the
way that she designed this was pretty
genius but I don't think that this
palette is for everyone I love that you
can put and she's kind of got them in
quads here where these colors go very
nice together and these colors go very
nicely together but at the same time you
can actually mix some of these other
ones as well
for example this color south is a really
nice blending color so you can use south
along with some of these other shades
over on this side same thing with this
placebo this matte I don't know what you
call that like a matte Coralie color you
could put this Santeria in the crease
with that and that would look really
nice so I mean Indy it's a very
versatile palette for a color palette
I mean Kat Von D is just genius when it
comes to colors I mean she's a tattoo
where she's got to be genius with colors
and she designed this very well as far
as the day glow color now I have this
palette here the naturally pretty
palette and I did a similar video with
this as I did with this where I showed
you the swatches and everything and this
one has something called transforming
pearl so it's the same kind of idea
where you put the transforming pearl
overtop of the matte shades and it's
supposed to turn them into shimmers now
what cats done instead of saying I'm
going to turn them into shimmers cat has
decided that she is going to transform
the actual color by putting dayglo over
top and as you saw in the swatches it
really does transform the color I don't
feel like it transfers as much on the
lid because you're usually looking at an
eyelid from a distance you were looking
the swatches close-up so I don't think
that the average person looking at your
eyeshadow is going to notice a huge
difference when you use dayglo but you
will probably notice and sometimes
that's enough
I do enjoy using dayglo it is really fun
but don't expect it to be this
miraculous oh my gosh everybody's like
freaking out over your eyeshadow because
you use the day glow I think people are
gonna freak out over your eyeshadow if
you use this color Salina which is so
incredibly unique the purple with the
blue sparkle in there is just fantastic
also this dog roses as you saw if you're
into bra
shadows it is the perfect bronze
eyeshadow just absolutely gorgeous now
as far as negatives about this palette I
feel like arc angel is a little bit on
the powdery side for Kat Von D eyeshadow
is a little bit harder to work with a
little bit more fading when are you down
moving my cat is moving around in a
paper bag and making lots of noise I
would appreciate if you would stop that
I've tried to shoot a video okay so
anyway this one is a little bit more
powdery than a typical Kat Von D
eyeshadow I was a little disappointed in
the formula that's definitely usable but
will fade over the day especially if you
don't use a primer it is a really fun
eyeshadow to play with but I don't feel
like this is for everyday wear for the
typical person I'm a teacher I don't
feel comfortable wearing a lot of these
shades to work but I can get away with
some wearing some of these over here to
work I just have to kind of really make
sure that I'm not you know obnoxious
with it or else it looks just really
strange far as the glitter that's in
this palette there isn't fallout on the
glitter like the way that some like
urban decay shadows where the glitter
just falls all over your face that does
not happen what is gonna happen is if
you do not tap off your brush these
shadows are very very soft if you do not
tap off your brush you will get a ton of
product on your teeth so you make sure
that you are tapping off your brush
before you apply and you will be just
fine especially if you're using a primer
but during the day definitely most of
them will last all day long again
Archangel was the only one that I've had
difficulty with well I forgot to show
you there is a giant mirror here which
is also nice if you're taking this on
the go overall for me for Kat Von D this
is a win but I can see where a lot of
people this would not be the palette for
you have this review of the Kat Von D
Esperanza palette was helpful for you if
it was given big old thumbs up and make
sure you subscribe so you can see more
palette and other makeup reviews in the
future I put up two to three videos a
week most of them are either
subscription box openings or new
products at the drugstore and also from
higher end stores such as Sephora so if
you like that kind of thing makes you
subscribe and mad love to you and I will
see you in a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
