Kat Von D metal met pallets can I just
say I love this artwork I just have to
say that right off the bat this review
is going to be a very thorough review
time stamps are down below of all the
things we are going to be including in
this video I will also place them next
to me so you can peruse the different
sections so you know what you are most
interested in now before we start on the
review I do want to go over quickly what
else I'm wearing on my face because I've
been getting a lot of requests for that
recently so my foundation is the Too
Faced Born This Way for blush today I'm
wearing the in stain by the balm in
pinstripe for the highlight I'm wearing
the SBS essence essence pure nude
highlighter in B my highlight and then
for lips I'm wearing the absolute New
York intense lip polish in the shade
nude so that is what is on my face let's
get into what is going on with this I
have had this for I guess about three
weeks my friend Nancy purchased this for
me Thank You Nancy for buying this for
me it gave me an opportunity to review a
very popular palette this thing has been
everywhere and overall it has been rave
reviews I do have some critiques for it
though for you and that I'm excited to
share with you so the first thing I want
to get into is where this is available
what comes in it and value so this
palette as you can see is bigger than my
head is gigantic and the pans are also a
very generous size for comparison
purposes I just want to show you
compared to the Urban Decay Naked
palette how large this palette is and
I'll show you inside so you can see the
difference between the pan sizes there
and then I'll show you the chocolate
bonbons palette which is the same size
as the other two-faced palettes that are
of the size so you can kind of see what
you're getting here and we are going to
compare these as far as value as well
Kat Von D does have her own Beauty
website this is not currently available
on that website it's only
on Sephora's website and I believe it is
limited edition it has has been out for
a little while so if you do decide you
won I do recommend you get it soon
before it sells out this is from Kats
website that says they absolutely do not
test on animals they will always be 100%
cruelty free that's something that cat
is very proud of it also says is Kat Von
D beauty vegan and it says the FDA
hasn't established a regulation for what
it means to be vegan we define it as a
product that does not contain any animal
products or byproducts and has not been
tested on animals and they have on the
Kat Von D website the hashtag vegan
alert to indicate the products that are
vegan unfortunately because this is not
available on the cat Fonzi website I do
not know 100% if it is vegan because
even an ingredient listed can be animal
derived or plant derived you don't
really know but it was not tested on
animals so as far as whether it's vegan
or not we don't know it is distributed
from San Francisco California and it is
made in the United States of America I
looked at this on the sephora website to
see the value what is this palette a
good value and I did notice that on the
website it is listed incorrectly it does
say that it's nine pans times one point
one four ounces which is an insane
amount of product I mean if you think
about like a tarte blush that's gonna be
point two ounces so alright they're
saying each pan is 1.4 ounces I mean
that's just crazy it also said on the
sephora website the same thing 13 times
1.4 ounces which would end up being like
783 grams which is absolutely insane and
there's just no way it's not right so I
looked on the box and we went by the box
so we have for the shimmer shades and
nine times point zero six ounces leading
to 1.7 grams and then the same thing
with the matte shades which is 13 of
them at point zero six ounces so these
are actually the exact same amount of
product in the shimmer and the matte so
that ends up being 34 point four grams
of product altogether it is $60 so that
leads us to one dollar and 60 cents per
gram which anything in the one dollar
range is a really good value the only
products I've ever found that been
then $1 program have been the juvie Asst
place pallets usually hi Aaron products
end up being in to $3 range so with
urban decay its $54 and you're paying $3
and 19 cents per gram for one of the
naked palettes for one of the Too Faced
palettes we're looking at 2 dollars and
79 cents per gram of product at $49 full
price so you can see that the metal mat
is definitely going to be a better value
than your popular high-end or I guess
you call them high-end Sephora brand
products comparing how much is in each
palette you get 2 and 2.2 times as much
product in the metal mat as you do in
the naked and 2.1 times as much product
as you do in a typical to face palette
of this size so definitely a fantastic
value here but is it worth your money
that's we're gonna get into next and the
best way for me to explain that to you
is to show you a demo of how I got this
look today I wanted to do something a
little bit out of my comfort zone so I
went with kind of a peacock II kind of
look there's a lot of color in here you
can get a beautiful neutral look if you
kind of stick to this end over here but
you can also get some really great bold
looks in here with some a lot of color
by using these so this is a great
palette not only for people that have a
lot of palettes and need something
different in their lives but it's also
good for people that just wanna
experiment with a little color maybe you
have a ton of neutral palettes and you
just want to try a little color in your
lower lash line this is a great palette
for that so let me go ahead and show you
how I got this look today and really
that right now
you caught my eye right from the start
and stole my heart I wasn't looking for
love
god I was cuckoo and I fell for you oh
baby girl you are
in
I wanna give the best me because you
deserve it uh I'll never I'll never
leave I'll be right here baby girl you
are
idolize in
they
when you need me I'll be there if you
Tayna love again I come
stand right by you everyday love you in
a special way just wanna get closer to
you baby girl I even see these go on
beautifully on the eye they play very
very well together they blend
effortlessly into each other without
becoming muddy which is fantastic one
thing you'll notice is the brushes that
I used in the application those are all
motor brushes and I could not find the
eyeshadow brush that I really really
like to pack on colors so I used one
that with a little fluffier but you can
see it still applied very very well even
with that slightly fluffier eyeshadow
brush one thing I can say about these is
that the performance of these compared
to let's say the Too Faced holiday
collections or some of the Tarte
palettes that have been coming out
recently that I've heard I haven't
bought a Tarte palette in quite a while
but from what I've heard they're just
not performing as good as they should so
this is one that definitely performs
really really well I feel like other
brands need to look at Kat Von D and see
what she's doing and kind of go that
route because her shadow formula is
amazing she's had some misses in her
holiday palettes in the past I don't
think it wasn't last year but the year
before I bought the Holi palette and was
not impressed with it this one is really
really good as far as the quality of it
here's my nitpick of it though I do feel
like the shimmer shades last longer on
the eye than the matte shades I did do
some all matte looks and they faded
pretty quickly
but I found that when I mix the shimmers
and the mattes
the look lasts much much much longer
this look will still be on my eyes and
very vibrant by the end of the day which
is amazing
I definitely cannot say that for a lot
of other palettes I have purchased
recently so that's a definite win for
this palette now now that I've mentioned
that let's talk about why I think that
maybe that the mattes do not last as
long as the shimmers we're gonna go into
the ingredient announce loop so I'm
gonna go ahead and tell you and some of
the ingredients what I think about the
ingredients and also environmental
working group is the resource that I use
in order to find ingredients
may be harmful for certain types of skin
or everybody in general so thankfully
one thing I have to say about this is
that Kat Von D's formulas do not have a
lot of yuck in them they don't have a
lot of red flags that pop up Kat Von D
does not list her ingredients on the
website so what I did because I am anal
retentive like that and I don't want to
miss anything I actually typed every
single one of these fine print
ingredients both on the front and the
back for all of the different formulas
of every eyeshadow into my computer it
took me about in a little over an hour
to do that to make sure I didn't miss
anything because it would of course be
the one that I didn't put into the
ingredient analysis system and that
would be the one that has something bad
in it so I didn't want to run that risk
so I ran the whole gamut I can typed
everything in and found out some
information about these ingredients so
first of all one thing to be aware of is
that every single one of these shadows
does include talc so if you are
sensitive to talc talc is something that
bothers you you definitely do not want
to purchase this palette because every
shade does have it now with talc it is a
filler that they use for eyeshadows it's
usually one of the number one
ingredients and that is no different in
this it is one of the big ingredients
it's kind of a base for the pigments to
kind of hold onto to give it more
substance so the talc is in here along
with mica in every single shadow
Environmental Working Group is always
updating their website so this is their
current warning about how studies by the
national toxicology panel demonstrating
that cosmetic grade talc free of
asbestos is a form of magnesium silicate
that also can be toxic toxic and
carcinogenic it is restricted in
cosmetics in the UK and Canada it's
classified as being toxic or harmful and
classified as a medium health priority
by the Canadian substance list so this
is something that is in a lot of
products here in the United States other
countries take it more seriously than we
do but I just wanted to let you know
that that is the current warning there
you can do research on talc and find a
few different arguments about whether
talc is harmful or not and it also
depends on what it mixes
with as well so just so you know wanted
to let you know about that the next one
is a preservative called phenoxyethanol
and that is a replacement for parabens
because it is paraben free they have to
use some kind of preservative so that it
the product doesn't grow bacteria like
maybe some other brands might have had
bacteria number I'm not gonna go there
alright so the next ingredient that is
in every single shadow is an ingredient
called fen oxy ethanol I think I said
that fen fennekin all there you go I got
it phenoxyethanol is rated a four on
Environmental Working Group
it's a preservative that they use in
place of parabens so that the product
doesn't grow harmful bacteria now this
has high concerns for irritation for the
eyes and skin and lungs also
occupational hazards have been
identified so people in certain
countries can only handle it so much
I've talked about this ingredient many
times it's in lots and lots and lots of
products it's restricted and use in
cosmetics in Japan and also classified
as toxic or harmful for products used
around the mouth in the European Union
and then the workplace exposure is also
in the European Union so just don't put
these eyeshadows on your mouth it's not
a good idea but it is interesting that
it's classified is not expected to be
potentially toxic or harmful by the
canada substance list so I thought that
was kind of interesting and it's not
banned by the FDA and anyway are
regulated by the FDA I looked up a
couple of websites that I will link
below one of them is truth in aging
which I find to be a pretty good
resource it says it's one of the few
preservatives that does not release
formaldehyde which is kind of cool
in 2013 it came to public attention in
the US when the FDA issued a warning
about its use in a cream called mommy
bliss for nursing mothers and the FDA
warm'd warned that this particular
ingredient can cause shutdown of the
central nervous system vomiting and
contact dermatitis in baby so do not let
your baby suck on your eyelid and you'll
be fine
so if you've ever heard of this
ingredient that may have been where so
chances are this is probably not going
to be a huge red flag to you for
eyeshadow application if you have
especially sensitive skin this could be
an
irritant for you though and then polish
choice also mentioned that it's almost
always synthetic but this chemical
naturally occurs in green tea which I
thought was pretty interesting alright
enough about that ingredient let's go
into some of the the dyes that are in
here one of them is yellow number 5
which is seen to be bio cumulative which
means that it builds up in your system
but we don't know how much it needs to
build up in your system in order for it
to be toxic but just so you know that's
there also chromium oxide greens it is
restricted for use on the lips by the
FDA so again don't put this on your lips
there is some persistence and
bioaccumulation for this as well and
then we have malic acid which is only
included in the shimmer shades which has
an irritation for the skin eyes are long
so you want to be careful with getting
those shimmer shades in your eye benzoic
acid it comes up as a three that's also
only in the shimmer shades and there's
data gaps for organ toxicity so they
just don't have enough information on
that one it's kind of mixed mish-mosh of
information so benzoic acid may or may
not be bad we just don't know cuz there
hasn't been enough enough research
behind it there's two more things
aluminum powder is only in the shade
ignite for neurotoxicity it is
restricted in the FT for the FDA
aluminum powder is something you don't
want a lot of on your skin it can go
into your skin and absorb into your skin
but it's it's only an ignite and I'm
sure that it is a very very small amount
because it is just abused as a pigment
in ignite ignite is this one right here
just so you know and then the last thing
is in the shade velvet which is this one
right here and velvet has cornstarch in
it and it also has cacao seed butter so
if you are sensitive to either one of
those ingredients you'll be fine to use
this palette
except for stay away from the shade
velvet I did learn that there are people
that are sensitive to corn from the
community there's someone in the
community so girlfriend do not use the
velvet alright one thing I also notice
which was really interesting is the
ingredient list for the shimmers was
insanely longer than the ingredient list
on the mast there was so much more that
they put into the shimmers so that maybe
some of those ingredients that are in
the shimmers and not in the mats may
have impacted the lasting power of the
shadows I thought that was really really
interesting but overall I mean nothing
that just sounds crazy there's people
that are really sensitive of parabens
there's no parabens in here and again it
is cruelty free so that's a really good
thing for those of you that pay a lot of
some people are really really diehard
about their cruelty-free products and
this is a cruelty free product before I
go into my final thoughts I do want to
show you some swatches of these products
so these swatches are going to be both
with a brush and with a finger so you
can see how they may apply if you choose
to tap them on with your finger like for
example the shade tinsel definitely can
go better with a fingertip because it's
kind of chunky it's the only one in here
that is chunky you're gonna see that
really they apply very very well with a
brush and the formula is very consistent
in that so check it out I know he's just
not right for you and you can tell me if
I'm off but I see it on your face
wouldn't you say that he's the one that
you love and you spend annoyance I'm in
the wrong situation any time you want me
to stop
again
shed on
we wasted
wasted
Hey
oh stop dying filled second you say you
like me too
I just wanna give you the love that
you're missing baby just to sit next to
you would be everything you need this
could be so different
tell me what you want to do because I
know I can't read
then again
settle
give me a sign big Lahan will be fine
let you down just know that you don't
have to do
Oh
walking treat you better than he can in
any girl like you deserves are gentlemen
so my overall thoughts on this pallet is
that I absolutely love it I do wish that
the matte shades lasted a little longer
and that's my only critique but again
like I said when you mix them with the
shimmers you're fine but if you're
getting this because you're loving the
matte shades and you mostly do matte
looks like if you have a lot of texture
on your lids and you don't want to use a
lot of shimmer you probably want to skip
this palette but overall it's definitely
a recommend i mean values they're the
the lasting power with the shimmers is
there you get a ton of product this will
last you and you can pass it on to your
great-grandchildren I mean this thing's
gonna last you a really long time it's
just a really good solid palette I do
love the mirror as well it is a
cardboard packaging with a magnetic
closure the magnet is very strong so you
could take this in travel and not worry
too much about it
opening up to be safe you might want to
keep the box if you're planning on
bringing this for travel but it is
ginormous so you may not be travel
friendly for you just because of the
other size of it is kind of insane
because I mean is who is huge but
overall definitely recommend for me I'm
gonna keep it I'm gonna love it I'm
gonna use it and I'm happy to have it so
