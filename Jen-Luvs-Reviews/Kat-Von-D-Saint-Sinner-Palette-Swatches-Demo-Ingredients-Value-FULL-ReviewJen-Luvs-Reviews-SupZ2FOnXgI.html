the brand new Kat Von D saint and sinner
eyes shadow palette for holiday of 2017
I have lots that I want to share with
you about this palettes lots of things
including who I definitely don't
recommend this for and who I definitely
would recommend this for so if you're
interested in that stay tuned
you've never been to one of my review
videos they are quite long I will be
putting timestamps down in the
description in case you'd like to skip
ahead to a specific section that happens
to be your favorite everyone seems to
have their favorites they're all linked
down below in case you want to skip
ahead so let's go ahead and start off
with what this palette is this is Kat
Von D's holiday released for 2017 she
always comes out with an eyeshadow
palette every single holiday season they
are notoriously amazing this one is very
interesting or kivett say it's very
interesting and and let's let's get into
that before we get into the nitty-gritty
just a little bit about Kat Von D as a
brand in this palette is sold at Sephora
and also a Kat Von D Beauty calm it is
$62 and you do get 24 eyes shadows that
are separated into two sides you have
the st. side and then you have these
Center side this is supposed to be your
softer looks and this is your more bold
looks of course you've got the two
mirrors on the side all the artwork on
here was done by Kat Von D and it was
also done kind of also to promote her
perfumes coming back which are also
called Saint and sinner so it's kind of
a cross promotional kind of thing with
that theme Kat Von D is a cruelty-free
Brad they've always been cruelty-free
and I do believe they're trying to go
more vegan this palette is a vegan
palette and that this product was made
in Canada so the idea behind inside is
it supposed to represent human duality
which Kat Von D is very deep and she's
very intellectual and philosophical and
all of that so it doesn't surprise me
that she's going really deep with the
meaning behind
this palette and as you read the names
of the shadows you'll notice a lot of
nods to Catholicism according to a
website Kat Von D says that there are
three finishes in this palette the
electrifying metallics velvety mattes
and shimmering pearls but then she says
that there are two new special effect
glimmer shades and she does say where
those are located which is at the very
top of the palette these are the glimmer
shades if you bought the Kat Von D shade
+ like glimmer palette these formula the
formula these two is very very similar
to the formula that's in there if it's
not the exact same formula you're
talking about value for a bit it is a
$62 palette like I mentioned earlier
they're 24 one Graham pan so therefore
we're paying two dollars and 58 cents
per gram and also two dollars and 58
cents per pan now that is a reasonable
price versa for a brand product I like
to see eyeshadow palettes at Sephora
when I think of them being a good deal
under $3 per gram so you are getting a
nice amount of product for your money
here that's in comparison with kind of
its peer groups in Tarte and to face and
lorac and and shadows like that we'll
talk a little bit about ingredients in
this palette really nothing out of the
ordinary in here I've seen all of these
ingredients before things that you might
want to note as there is dimethicone I
don't worry about dimethicone as much in
eyeshadow as I think about it in
foundations and things because
dimethicone can kind of clog pores for
some people but I haven't really heard
anybody say dimethicone clogs their
eyelid pores so I don't really think
about it there but I know some people
are sensitive as I'm ethic own so
there's that in case you're sensitive
also there is talc in here I know some
people are sensitive to tell so just so
you know there is mica in here and in my
last video I talked about that someone
had mentioned something about child
labor at mica and there is a whole bunch
of information on the internet if you
google it about mica and child labor but
what it seems like and I could do a
whole video on this if you're interested
based on you know I'll just do a bunch
of research and tell you what I found
basically what's happening is is there
are some countries where there is lead
they're illegal
mica mines where children are working
but this is how their families of four
to
live and survive so if you don't buy
them like other than the kids get laid
off and then they don't have any money
so it's one of those really difficult
situations about whether you boycott
Micah because of the child labor but
then are you cutting off your nose to
spite your face kind of situation where
now the children don't have money and
then they don't have food so it's it's a
really really tricky situation you just
have to kind of look inside your heart
and decide whether you want to buy
products with Micah but just know that
Micah is a product that is in so many
make up products I mean any make up
product that has shimmer in it it
probably has some form of mica in it I
will leave some links to some videos and
articles and stuff down in the
description below in case you want to
read more the last ingredient I want to
talk about is phenoxyethanol that's the
preservative in here some people are
sensitive to it there are no parabens in
here oh one more thing and that is that
some of these shades are not lips safe
seven of them in particular there are
some pigments that are eye safe but not
lip safe and there's been a lot of
questions in the comments about that
well I kind of equate it to like hot
peppers like you would eat hot peppers
and you'd be good but you wouldn't want
to put them in your eyes same thing with
like saline drops you can put those in
your eyes but you don't want to ingest
saline there are different ways that
things in kind of get into our body that
are safe one way but not another way so
in this way the eye shadows are said to
be eye safe by the FDA but they are not
found to be lift safe I'm assuming
something having to do with ingesting
the product so some people like to put
eyeshadow on their lips to kind of alter
the color of their lipstick or to create
a shine so I want to let you know which
ones are not lips safe and those are
I'll put the picture up right now we
have worship vestment ministry Exodus
Cathedral rosary and exorcism those are
the shades that you don't want to pat on
your lips all the rest of them seem to
be lips safe based on the pigments
listed all right so now that we've kind
of gone into the Nitty Gritty of this
palette let's go ahead and show you some
swatches I do have swatches on two
different skin tones this time I have
myself which is a lighter skin tone and
I have my friend Jenny who is a medium
skin tone so let's go ahead and get into
those swatches right now all right here
is the outer packaging of the saint and
sinner palette and then you open up the
doors and use
be stateside on the left and the center
side on the right we're gonna go ahead
and swatch the st. side first which is
absolution worship immaculate and
chalice for the first four you can see
that absolution is that glimmer shade
this is a very typical swatch for one of
her glimmer shades it's very consistent
with her other palette that she'd
chalice is ridiculous in the foil there
now I'm gonna use my regular shader
brush for absolution you can see that it
doesn't work at all that's also
consistent with the other formula one
thing you're gonna notice about these
shimmer and foil shades is that they
don't work super well with a brush like
this this is my preferred brush that I
like to use to pack color on the lid I
have not had luck with a synthetic flat
shader brush with these I also haven't
had much luck with a sponge tip
applicator which you're gonna see in
just a minute but they do pack a very
well with a finger tip and you may be
able to play with different brushes that
you own and have better luck than I did
so here's that sponge tip applicator and
we're gonna go ahead and try to brush
that on first and you can see that that
doesn't works let's go ahead and try to
pack it on and you can see that works
just a little bit better I find the same
results on the eye as you're seeing on
my arm it just doesn't work but I knew
somebody was gonna ask me about it so I
figured I would just do a little demo
there so this is the first set of 4
overall really great shadows honestly I
feel like these are best applied with a
finger tip unless you're using them to
blend into other shades and you don't
want these to be the most prominent
color they will blend nicely with a
brush but it has to be something where
you don't want a super big pop of color
with a brush if you're new to my channel
you are new to the wipe test and this is
supposed to simulate a long day of wear
and as you can see almost every shadow
does stain the skin which means that you
are going to get a longer lasting time
most likely with shadows like these I am
not wearing a primer on my arms so
definitely keep that in mind
that a primer may even further extend
the we're moving on to the next four in
the st. section we have Sacred Heart
Amen sanctuary and heaven these are also
really good shades very consistent in
quality with the last ones amen is our
first match shade that we've seen and
you're gonna see it's absolutely
stinking gorgeous Kat Von D knows how to
rock a white matte heaven is also very
unique to my collection it is an
absolutely beautiful pink silver
duochrome
look at that look at that white oh my
gosh it's so pretty it's so good when
sanctuary comes back in focus you'll be
able to see that that one does pack on
very well with the brush and so does
heaven heaven actually packs on very
well with a brush I'm still working on
my focusing issues every time I feel
like it gets a little bit better but
we're still not perfect yet definitely
my favorite in this quad I don't know
either Amen or having they're both
amazing really good actually this is
just a great quad overall you're not
gonna believe this wipe test you're not
gonna believe it oh no oh no look look
look all what just happened amen it's
still there can I get an amen oh my gosh
I can't even believe it that like never
happens with white shades but you can
see heaven does fade away so you
definitely want to use a primer with
this or a glitter glue to make sure that
heaven does stick around the other two
stain pretty well as well the last four
on this side are crucifix Cathedral
rosary and baptism another really strong
set of four oh my gosh that Cathedral
it's purple with a silver shift it's so
gorgeous
baptism swatched really really badly so
I just brought that back in that made it
in my fault because my pinkie finger was
the one that's watched it it really is a
nice shade I don't think I like it quite
as much as Amen but it's still really
good crucifix no effort on the pigment
there absolutely no effort Cathedral
does take some building with the brush
a baptism is really beautiful it is it's
light purple tents compared to Amen just
a really really nice shade and again
just great quality here rosary is kind
of the same as the issue that I had with
worship and immaculate and Sacred Heart
and that you know they don't really work
really well with this kind of brush but
she Mabel to be able to find out I
should brush in her collection that
works better I haven't been able to find
one in my collection and with the white
test again they are all still there
which is insanely impressive that like
never happens let's move on to the
center side we've got rapture Sabbath
ashes and martyr rapture is that glimmer
shade you're gonna see that in the
tutorial all over my lid in just a
minute
sabot is a black it's not the blackest
black in the world but I I don't hate on
that I really personally don't like a
super black black that's just me I I
rather have one that builds up one that
can blend into other shadows I find a
very intense black difficult to work
with let's go ahead back in with that
sponge tip applicator with rapture just
to kind of show you that it will build a
bit with the sponge tip applicator but
really a finger tip for me is the best
if you have long nails you might want to
take that into consideration when buying
this palette easy that Sabbath really
isn't that strong now ashes ashes is an
amazing shade that glitter in there
actually stays on the eye after
application which again is unheard of
martyr is another beautiful matte shade
it is perfectly done the pigmentation is
amazing it is a great transition color
for a lot of skin tones it's okay for me
it's a little deep for me
but I have used it and I do enjoy it
this is a very strong set of four as
well definitely ashes is my favorite
followed very closely by martyr in this
set but I'm not hating on rapture and
Sabbath either they're both good shades
too if you've seen the wipe test on my
channel before you know that this
doesn't happen that often that all of
the shades hang out like this I mean the
last entire on this palette is soon
the next set a for devil revelation
vestment and ministry devil is another
really really nice true or in shade
revelation is similar in formula to
ashes in that it's kind of a matte base
with glitter thrown into it but it's
like the way I always wanted the
two-faced glitter ones to be and the one
that Tarte had made I mean the glitter
really does hang out there which is so
unusual you can see absolutely no effort
with Devils super awesome revelation
also no effort vestment is a really cool
teal brown it doesn't really brush
swatch very well but I promise you it
does apply to the lid if you're willing
to use a finger tip or if you find a
brush that works better for you it's
it's a gorgeous gorgeous teal brown
shade and ministry I feel like does turn
purple on the eye it's very blue in the
pan but it definitely turns purple and
you can really see that in the swatch
there is a lot of Brown investment so
definitely keep that in mind because in
the pan it does look more teal but there
really is a lot of brown and the
undertone and if you're gonna use this
just to kind of swirl in the outer
corner to deepen up a look you're not
going to get that punch of teal your the
only way you're gonna get that punch of
teal is if you pack it on to the lids
the other shades are all awesome except
for like I said ministry don't expect it
to stay blue it may turn purple on you
I've been go away again pigmentation for
the win just insane the way that it
stains the skin and this is not a
permanent stain it takes off very easily
with makeup remover but it will last on
your lids all day long at least from my
personal experience moving on to the
final set of four we have Exodus
exorcism a relic and stigmata
I thought Exodus was a really weird
shade to include in here to include a
neon thought was very odd but I'm trying
to figure out how to use it I haven't
used it yet on the eye you can see that
the swatch is really really good on this
exorcism is a bit weak on the swatch
this is probably my least favorite shade
and the palette purples are notoriously
hard to do and I don't feel like they
nailed it with exorcism but that's
pretty much the only shade in the
palette I feel like
didn't nail relic is wonderful I have
used that one and looks and it blends
really nicely with the other shades and
stigmata I have also used another
gorgeous gorgeous shade and just very
very happy with these shadows overall
favorite shadow of this set of four is
relic least favorite and the entire
palette is exorcism but I'm still not
hating on it it's just my least favorite
of the 24 shades the 23 other ones are
amazing this one's just good and again
all of them hanging out beautifully from
the white tests like move on to Jenny
swatches Jenny has a medium skin tone
she is a Filipino descent and you can
see how these look on her that is the
first set of four here is the second set
of four from the Saints side just a men
just showing up gorgeous on her again I
need an Amen right here for Amen it is
beautiful sanctuary also looks really
really pretty on her and then with
crucifix Cathedral rosary and baptism
Cathedral is gorgeous rosary would be
really nice packed on the lid for her
and you can really see how crucifix
shows up beautifully in baptism -
they're just really beautiful on her now
we're moving onto the center side these
don't look quite as good on her I think
as they do on me especially with martyr
it's starting to kind of blend into her
skin tone a bit but I think this would
be a beautiful transition on her ashes
really does ash out on her I'd be
curious to see what this would look like
on her lid but I would imagine this
wouldn't flatter her as much as it
flatters my skin tone or other skin
tones and you can see that Sabbath
really doesn't show up as a true true
black and the next one's devil
revelation investment and ministry I
think I just did a bad swatch on
vestment that's not vestments fault I
think that's my fault
but you can really see that purple
showing through and ministry at least in
my opinion devil is gorgeous revelation
again gorgeous and the final one's
exorcism again falls flat
the other ones are really good I may not
have swatched relic enough on her with
the brush but it does show up nicely on
her skin I'm not sure if they these
necessarily flatter her skin tone those
yellow shades very much eye but I
haven't worked very much with medium
skin so I can only speak so much to it
hope you found those swatches helpful
now that you have seen the swatches of
the palette let's go ahead and I will
show you a demo of how I got this look
today I do want to give the disclaimer
because I've been getting more and more
comments lately about Jen you really
aren't talented at eyeshadow I've got
one of the best back word compliments
ever the person said I love watching
your tutorials because you kind of suck
at eyeshadow and I kind of suck too so I
know if you can't make it work I
probably won't be able to make it work
either and I thought that was pretty
awesome I don't really think I suck at
eyeshadow but I am I'm not a makeup
artist so you can kind of see if you're
not a makeup artist how you might be
able to work with these shadows I don't
do super complicated looks but that's
good for some people you know it's not
good for others it's good for some
people so I hope you enjoy my demo I'm
gonna go ahead and show that to you
right now
alright here's my demo of the look that
I did today we're gonna start off with
the Kat Von D eyeshadow primer I do feel
like my eyeshadow primer is drying out a
bit it's not as creamy as it was when I
first got it it's probably about time to
let this go but I did want to use it
with this and that is the Kat Von D eye
primer I did want to use it now I have
been breaking into my bronzers as
transition colors for with this palette
because really there's only one shade
that I can use as transition in here and
it's the one called martyr this is the
shade amen and then Amen is an amazing
matte white shade it is phenomenal and
you can see it right there to deepen up
the outer corner we're gonna go in with
crucifix and I barely tapped my brush
into the palette and you can see how
much pigment there is I mean it's just
insanely pigmented if you do get this
just keep that in mind that you want to
very gently tap your brush for this and
then build up slowly because it is
intense and I'm just blending that out a
bit with a clean fluffy brush
I decided I wanted to show you how these
glimmer shades work and I hadn't used
rapture yet so we're gonna go with some
two-faced glitter glue on the lid to
make sure that that shade rapture sticks
I do feel like you need a glitter glue
with her glimmer formula there it is
let's go ahead and Pat it on and see how
it looks and you can really see that
shimmer and shine alright so here comes
that rosy shade to try to deepen up the
outer corner I do wish I'd laid that
down first but it's working out okay
it's working out fine and I can always
tap rapture over top of it if I need to
and this is just a teeny tiny little
Coastal Scents brush that I love just
bringing it up into the crease just a
little bit just to add a little more
dimension and then this is baptism I'm
just adding that into the inner corner
just so you can see a different lighter
shade and then back into crucifix to
deepen up the crease
it's kind of winging it out a tiny bit
to try to get that triangle on my outer
corner and now into the shade martyr to
just bring it up on my brow bone just a
little bit it's very intense and I
really didn't like the way that it
looked very much so I tried to cover it
up with a men which will also lighten up
my brow bone a bit and just kind of
soften up martyr because martyr was just
too strong with him for what I was going
for bland bland bland bland bland bland
bland bland bland bland bland bland and
just to show you a different shade I
dipped into sanctuary for the lower
lashline and you just see it goes on
super easily like it was only on there
for a quick second and then into heaven
I'm just gonna bring that all over the
lower lashline to give a shine on the
bottom now it does look a little bit
weird but it's gonna look better with
liner and lashes in just a second here
it comes and bam there it is so there's
liner and lashes with it and I do like
the way this eye look came out of course
it is a little bit more bold but I feel
like this I shadow palette really lends
itself to bold looks you can get some
more neutral looks out of it but I feel
like a bold look is really what this
strength is for this palette that's it
for the eye look now on to the full
review so all that business is now out
of the way let's get into my full review
this is where we start getting really
subjective in my personal opinions of
this eyeshadow palette so let's go ahead
and start with the packaging I do really
love the packaging it's absolutely
beautiful it is large but not as large
as some of her other holiday eyeshadow
palettes which I appreciate because you
know I've got limited space as far as
storing eyeshadow palettes at this point
I think it's absolutely gorgeous the
design you can tell it was designed by a
true artist these I mean she definitely
nailed the cathedral look here don't you
think I really nailed it
the only thing that I don't like as a
non makeup artist is that I get really
overwhelmed by the color selection and
the way that it's set up look I look at
this and I go oh my gosh what am I gonna
do with that like how do I even put
these colors together I'm gonna show you
some pictures now that were captured
from reddit and I think my facebook
group I don't know
I'll put the sources down below of
pictures that people have done where
they've reorganized the shadows that
kind of make them have make more sense
as far as the the way that the colors
are paired and this really these
pictures really helped me to kind of
decide how I wanted to use these shades
together because I can tell you right
now you cannot just take a random shade
from this and pair it with another
random shades and it will work some
palettes you can do that where you can
really just go anywhere and kind of go
you know light on the inside medium
medium shade in the middle and a deep
shade on the outside and do a little
transition and you're done and it
doesn't matter what shade you use this
is not one of those palettes this
actually takes some thinking for me
personally I need to really process what
colors look good together thinking about
the color wheel and all of that and it
definitely isn't a brainless eyeshadow
palette for me also with the color
selection there really isn't a lot in
here that will set up the base of the
look so as you saw in the demo I used
the hoola bronzer as my transition shade
and I really really like doing that just
grabbing either a cool tone bronzer or a
warm tone bronzer to set up this palette
because I feel like it really kind of
gives a different base to the look
that's rather than using martyr which is
the closest to a transition shade for me
because this is so warm if I want to go
a little cooler I don't really want to
use martyr so I can reach in for a
cooler transition if you're deeper the
shade crucifix is really really really
really pigmented just make sure you're
going in with a light hand because who
it can get really really deep so that
may work as a transition for some people
but other than that you really don't
have a lot as far as like brow bone
highlights and blending colors you've
got a men you could probably use baptism
a bit but you know it's just not set up
for that and this is set up for me the
best way I found use this is a
supplemental palette using this kind of
setting on my face with another palette
and then using this and just kind of
pulling you know two or three shades
maybe even four shades from this palette
for a look as you can see today I try to
use as many colors as possible so I did
use more shades from this than I have in
the past but I definitely feel like this
is not a standalone palette and I don't
think this is for people that don't have
that artistic eye of what shades go
together because I've done some a couple
of looks that came out rulla rulla bad
because I picked the wrong colors the
finishes I love that she did a variety
of finishes I have so much respect for
the shade ashes and I'll tell you why
it's because the I do have the swamp
Queen palette from Tarte and that was
made with bunny Meyer from graveyard
girl and that this is what I wanted the
one shade on her palette to be and what
happens with that shade is that you
swatch it and then you blow on and all
the glitter goes away but with this
shade the glitter actually stays I did
my top ten tips for shopping at Ulta and
my boxycharm review where I was wearing
a look using this palette and I had this
shay - is all over my lid if you could
see it up close you would see that the
sparkles really hung on there I had very
little fall out through the day and I
was so impressed with this shade I've
never had a shade like this that I liked
as much as ashes where it's kind of
thought that matte base and then they
throw the glitter in there and it's just
really really gorgeous
I also did a look here with martyr devil
and revelation and I really like that
look a lot I haven't dabbled as much in
these brighter shades down here for
whatsapp and makeup I did a look with
relic and Immaculate and that looks
really really cool with the gold and the
green oh my gosh that came out amazing
so you can definitely get some beautiful
looks because there are so many cool
finishes in here like you saw today I
use rapture as kind of a topper with
these two shades just like in the
glimmer palette you definitely want to
use a glitter glue like you saw in the
demo definitely want to use a glitter
glue because these will be all over your
face by the end of the day if you don't
use a glitter glue I feel like the rest
of the shades
except for Cathedral I feel like you can
get away with not using a glitter glue
and having it all over your face the
wear time of this eyeshadow palette is
just what I would expect from Kat Von D
it is fantastic I still have beautiful
separation separation of color by the
end of the day I mean this is 10 11 12
hours of wear and I still have
separation of color you can still see
the original eye look which is very very
rare of a shadow formula outside of Kat
Von D my devious place I'm good my visi
R I'm good and my coloured raine I'm
good but other than that from my
personal collection I have a lot of
trouble getting eyeshadows to last that
and it doesn't seem to matter whether I
use the Kat Von D eye primer or other
eye primers in my collection they all
seem to work just as well which really
makes me happy and one more thing I want
to talk about about mixing these shades
together is that one thing that will
happen sometimes when you lay colors
down next to each other is that they
will kind of muddy together or one will
fade away and other will dominate these
really blend beautifully into each other
and kind of create new shades when
they're next to each other which I love
because you can really get super
creative mixing these shades together to
create completely different looks so the
final question is who is this good for
who is this not good for lest I want who
it's not good for I would not buy this
for my mother there's no way in the
world I would ever buy this for my
mother someone like my mom who likes a
bunch of neutral shades and just wears a
basic eye look to work every day this is
definitely not for her and you can look
at this and kind of already know that
it's kind of like a no-brainer kind of
thing but I mean you can create some
neutral looks but if you're looking for
neutral looks then you probably want to
skip this palette people that are
beginners I feel like are gonna get
really frustrated with this palette
especially if you don't have that
artistic eye the last time I mentioned
this I had some critiques where people
were saying you know well nobody's born
with an artistic eye and I disagree with
that I feel like there are people that
are born with specific talents because
you know maybe their parents were
artists you know they're you look at you
know Claire from Claire in the cross
because I don't know if you know her but
she's this adorable little girl who
sings beautifully that is a talent that
child was born with she did not train of
course she's just training to be better
but she was born with that talent I feel
like the same thing with with being an
artist some people are born with an I to
know how colors go together and I feel
like the rest of us kind of have to
practice and work and train it's get
even close to those talented people like
Kat Von D so if you are not one that has
it has a good eye for putting colors
together I would not recommend this just
because it's very difficult to figure
out what shades to go together unless
you look for reference material online
other people that have done looks my
friend Nicole from yay or nay Nicole I
know she's working on a review of this
with a bunch of different looks whenever
she gets those videos up which hopefully
is soon I will link those in the
description down below so you can check
those out and
her different looks that she's created
with this palette but overall it is a
tricky palette to work with when it
comes to the shade selection if you are
an artist if you are tired of all of the
same eyeshadow palettes what do we do
another neutral palette for what do we
need another warm eyeshadow palette for
this palette is for you okay this is
this is a what I believe Kat Von D made
this eyeshadow palette for for the
people that want to get creative the
people that want to try something new
for those Instagram artists for people
that like those bold eye shadow looks
this palette is so for you and I think
you will really really love it a lot for
me I am very thankful to have it because
it takes me out of my comfort zone it
makes me try something new it makes me
think of color in a new way and I feel
like this palette is making me a better
artist and I love that and it makes me
so happy in my heart and I'm so thankful
to have this I'm so thankful Kat Von D
came out with this and that she is
pushing the boundaries of what typical
eyeshadow palettes look like and that
she's doing something different and
unique and she's kind of going with her
heart on it and I I respect that so much
and I am so thankful to have this
palette and you know you just kind of
have to decide for yourself like always
whether what I've told you in this video
will kind of make you go one way or the
other I would love to know your thoughts
