the Kat Von D shade + light glimmer eye
palette I have a lot I want to tell you
about this palette and including people
I don't think this would be good for and
people that I think would absolutely
love this so stay tuned if you've never
been to one of my reviews before there
are quite long I have lots of
information to give you so if you're not
interested in part of the review you can
go ahead get to the next section and
you'll probably be interested in that
part time stamps will be down below for
easy snip ability we're going to start
with what in the world in this catholic
extent this is the sister palette true
sister palette - the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette I have the newer
version of the eye palette this just
came into my life recently so I do have
the matte version at this point and I
did use it as part of the look that I'm
wearing today that I'll show you in the
demo in a minute so this is the pretty
much the exact same color scheme we have
whoop we have a section of neutral then
cool and then warm tone shades in
different quads the big difference is
that this one is all math and this one
is different levels of shimmer and shine
this is $49 you can get this currently
at Kat Von D beauty calm and also at
Sephora calm supposedly is limited
edition tellin D is a cruelty free brand
this is also a vegan product where the
original shade + light eye contour
palette was not vegan this product is
not made in the USA it is actually made
in Canada the packaging is a hard
plastic this has a texture to it
you've got the holographic print here
and the shade names are printed on the
back they do match if you flip it over
so if you're looking the color on the
far left is porcelain and this color on
the far left is porcelain that's how its
printed on the back and I do like that
she took the time and effort to print
the shade names on the back I know some
people prefer that they be printed on
the front but I feel like with the way
this plastic is it's a
very shiny plastic that it might have
scraped off or rubbed off unless it was
actually etched into the plastic because
it is a smooth plastic so I can see why
she didn't do that if she wanted to have
this sweet shiny plastic packaging on
the inside you do have a large mirror at
the top it says Kat Von D and I do find
this mirror to be great size for this
pallet it is a snap closure not a
magnetic closure it feels extremely
sturdy it is very heavy you notice that
right away when you hold it it's got
some serious weight to it
my first big big big critique of this
pellet that I feel like Kat Von D
seriously dropped the ball on with it
there is no look hard or directions for
how to use this pallet in the original
shade and light palette at least the one
that I got there was a pamphlet that you
could look at that had different eye
looks you could create I feel like
because she's got these different
formulas that are new to her line she
really should have included some kind of
directions on the website it does say
that it's an eye contouring palette with
12 neutral shades in a range of glimmer
finishes their shimmering satin base
shades
pearl eyes metallic contour shades
reflective glitter defined shades and
special effect glimmer topcoat but
there's nowhere on here that I can tell
where it identifies which one is which
so if you're new to makeup you may not
have any idea where what to start with
what is she even mean where are these
shapes located huge huge huge drop of
the ball on that this is the box and
it's absolutely gorgeous
boxes insane it says get inspired go to
Kat Von D beauty calm / how to's to
watch Kats makeup tutorials and as of
the day that I'm filming there isn't a
single tutorial on this palette on the
site which i think is ridiculous I think
that's crazy to release something like
this without any instructions
another thing it says in the description
is it says it's Kat Von D signature high
performance long wear eye shadow formula
which is just straight up not true it's
not true it's not real because all of
these to my knowledge are brand new
formulas to the line except for the
shade here which is just a guess it
seems like the way that they feel that
they are the same
formula as the chrysalis palette and the
monarch palette where they had kind of a
satiny texture to them but this is
extremely different and formula than the
metal matte palette then the the
original shade and light palette then
The Alchemist palette those are the
three pellets that I have ingredients
for castle and he doesn't like to post
her ingredients anywhere except for on
the boxes so I don't have the other ones
but I can tell you that these do not
match up with her most recent palette so
I feel like that is her long wear
eyeshadow formulas or signature formula
that I don't believe to be true at all
and I think that that's very misleading
and makes me unhappy it is possible that
shadow pellets in the past had some of
these formulas but honestly I seriously
doubt it I do have like the ladybird
palette and I have some of her really
old formula and none of those feel or
look or perform like these she has
identified those four different formulas
and I believe that there's one of each
formula in each quad so the top row is
going to be those base shades that she
talked about the first shade in each
quad down here so this one this one and
this one
those are going to be your pearlized
metallic contour shades the next ones
are the reflective glitter defined
shades that's this one this one and this
one and then finally the special effect
glimmer topcoat this one this one and
this one so it is easy to find and I
just wish you've included that
information one of the things that
really irritated me about this palette
to begin with was that I was having
trouble remembering which shades did
which things so here is a quick guide
just looking at the ingredients so
sterling quartz and glacier those top
coats all have very similar formulas
then rust and bronze have very similar
formulas but cinder is a little bit
different then we have porcelain dust in
dune of course that have similar
formulas but add in copper because
copper is a very similar formula to
those three and then onyx and Jasper
have very similar formula so you can
kind of treat those the same they kind
of follow the pattern of the palette but
it's a little bit different it
very confusing and and for me is their
stressful palette to use in it's palette
you get 17.1 grams of product which is a
lot of product and it costs $49 so that
leads us to 2 dollars and 87 cents per
gram of product which is on the middle
to less expensive end of Sephora brand
products there's definitely a lot more
expensive products price per gram than
this in Sephora but it's not it's
definitely not overpriced but it's not
the cheapest that you can get it's
getting pretty close though it's a good
deal for something that you might buy at
Sephora
there was a $24 brush that was marketed
to be used with this palette I did not
purchase that brush but I believe that I
do have some brushes that are similar
and that I feel work well with this
palette as far as ingredients that you
may be concerned with for one reason or
another every single one these shadows
has talc in it so if you are allergic to
health that is not good for you I'm very
sorry for not the ethanol as the
preservative you there are no parabens
but phenoxyethanol is something that
some people are sensitive to as well
there in Depok owned in three of the
shades which are the Sterling Group
glacier and quartz shades there is
dimethicone there are no palm oil
derived ingredients that they are very
apparent to me on like SX will palmitate
something like that so if you are anti
palm oil from what I'm looking at at a
glance you I don't think that there are
any palm oil ingredients there 24 total
ingredients used in this palette but
some of them are used in some shades and
not in others so I'll just make you a
little paragraph down below of
ingredients that may or may not be
contained in these shadows they're
included in at least two of the shadows
the last thing I want to mention about
the ingredient is these all do seem to
be lip safe I didn't see any ferric
ferrocyanide or chromium oxide greens or
anything like that I guess because it is
a neutral colored and usually the
problems that we have with lips safe
products or eye safe products are
usually in those color colors like the
Reds and the greens and you know things
like that so there are these all do seem
to be lip safe you can definitely check
with Kat Von D and email the Kat Von D
Beauty calm to make sure their lips a
face from the surface they seem to be
so now that we're done with ingredients
I want to go ahead and show you swatches
of the entire palette there will be both
finger and brush swatches right now
alright here you go my friends here are
your swatches of the shade and light
glimmer palette as you can see they are
separate into the three quads the first
quad is for neutral the middle is for
cool and the right is for warm we're
going to go ahead and start with the
neutral quad this consists of porcelain
on the top and then copper bras and
sterling on the bottom feel like these
all swatch finger swatch pretty well you
can see that porcelain picks up really
well on the brush but I don't feel like
at Birth swatches very well at all when
you see the demo you'll see how
beautiful that applies to the eye I
don't feel like it's 100% represented
here with the brush swatch I think it's
better on the eye copper is very nice it
is buildable which I like I do really
like bronze a lot I think it's a
beautiful shade
sterling is a little tricky to work with
it takes some practice figuring out how
it best applies and this might be better
with the Kat Von D brush I don't know it
works okay with my beauty junkies brush
I will link this brush down below it's
very inexpensive you can get off Amazon
but yeah I mean I like the neutral quad
I don't feel like you can make a
complete look out of anything in this
palette I really feel like it's best
paired with some kind of matte neutral
look or matte colorful look it doesn't
matter the reason why I do two wipes has
to give the hint to lasting power and
also how they blend you see the dark
shades hang on the light shades
disappear which is relatively typical
but I would like to see the light shades
hang on a little bit better if they
could moving on to the cool quad I feel
like dusk is the worst finger swatch as
far as comparisons I would apply on the
eye
it applies pretty good on the eye I like
porcelain just a little bit better but
it is nice I do really like cinder
cinder is beautiful and dust just looks
like doodoo man but cinder is really
nice I really like that one a lot onyx
is a great shade too because the glitter
does hang out on there unlike some
blacks with glitter undertones the
glitter will fall away I feel like the
glitter doesn't only fall away with this
even if you just swirl it in the outer
corner you can still see some glitter
and then glacier is also very beautiful
but again very tricky to work with both
Stirling and glacier glacier is a little
more white where sterling of course is a
little more silver I feel like you can't
tell any difference between those two
shades when you put them on the eyes
unless you look at super super close
wiping them away same deal is with the
neutral quad just the dark shades are
the ones that are going to hang out
there for you the last quad is probably
the most solid out of all of them as far
as performance this is the warm quad
dude is really really a nice shade but
rough I have to say is my absolute
favorite I love rust
but quartz is my favorite of the
stoppers that's that last shade over on
the right but oh my gosh you see Ross do
you see it oh my gosh is so pretty
Jasper it's just tricky it's good it's
just tricky it takes some practice at
least it did for me but quartz quartz is
really nice that as you saw with the
ingredients the ingredients for quartz
is slightly different than sterling
glacier and I do like the quartz better
and the shimmer is very very beautiful
in these shades I really like this quad
a lot it's definitely my favorite I do
feel like anybody of any skin tone would
be able to get use out of this palette I
don't think I mentioned that later but I
do feel like it I just feel like
depending on how you lay down your base
that's going to be up to you and then
just use these as accent colors as we do
the wipe test you'll notice that these
all really do hang out there you can see
little bits of the lighter shades still
there which is very impressive for
lighter shades now we're going to be
something a little different I wanted to
lay down the Too Faced glitter glue so
you could see how these shades stay on
the arm with the glitter glue as opposed
to the way it was a moment ago with no
primer nothing at all so we're just
going to do those last two shades in the
three on the bottom for each quad
because I feel like those are the ones
that really need the glitter glue the
first one on the bottom of the three
that one I feel like there's a little
more typical so I don't feel like that
one needs the glitter glue as much as
the other two formulas and you'll see
that there are so much more vibrant
especially those white shades just the
vibrancy they really stand out now where
before they kind of blend it into the
arm
and that Jasper shade really starts to
pop now over top of the glitter glue
where before it just kind of fell flat
for me
just a completely completely different
texture I wish the Kat Von D had been
able to create her own glitter glue to
go with these and they included it with
the palette as a gift with purchase I
feel like that would have been ideal
that would have been what I would have
suggested to her if I was on her
marketing team I think it would have
definitely lowered people's frustrations
using this palette if they had had that
with it I with the wipe test you'll see
that it is unreal it does make a huge
difference you can even see those very
light shades are still there to an
extent you also get a little bit of
smudging this there I had a little bit
of my black fuzz from quick background
there but you still you can see that
they kind of smudge a little bit now
instead of just staining which is really
cool now you've seen the swatches I do
want to show you how I got this I look
today it is my favorite look that I've
created with this palette I feel like
I've finally figured it out so I'm
anxious to show you how I got this look
today and that's come up now all right
here comes the tutorial ish kind of
thing except for this palette I am going
to be using the Kat Von D eyeshadow
primer I do like this almost as much as
my urban decay in my old eye if you
can't use the urban decay or the Ulta
for some reason I definitely recommend
checking this one out it does work very
well it's a different formula I'm going
to go ahead and into the original shade
and light eyeshadow palette and just use
that first shade there for a transition
and then everything else is going to be
from the glimmer palette but I really
wanted to do a transition that was matte
and then use as many shades as possible
for the rest of the look so we're going
to start off with porcelain all over the
lid and you'll just see the immediate
opacity there it's so stinking beautiful
oh my gosh now we're going to go into
the glitter glue and because Kat Von D
is cruelty free and vegan I wanted to
use a natural glitter glue so this is
the one my silk natural I don't think it
works quite as well as the Too Faced but
it's still very good now we're going to
put bronze out in the outer corner and
kind of build up the deepness there and
then add that little bit of sparkle out
there it's very opaque and very dark so
it takes
definitely some blending to get it to
soften al and now going into my favorite
shade rust and kind of putting that over
top of the other shade closer to the
brow line and now we're going to try one
of those toppers this is sterling and I
was kind of nervous to shake if it
didn't work for me in the past and we're
going to use quartz on the other side I
figure out in a minute I really don't
like the way this looks and fix it so
when it told me that if you use the dark
shades with a little bit of setting
spray that they work better so I was
trying that out on the lower lash line
with onyx on the outer corner to the
center and I do really like the way it
looks but I did feel like I needed to
smudge it a little bit with my finger
now we're going to go in with Jasper on
the center to the inner corner because I
just wanted a darker a little bit Smokey
Row look for today now I realized that I
really didn't like the way that courts
contrasted with Sterling I didn't think
it was enough so I grabbed the shade and
put it on instead and I liked it so much
better again it's just trial and error
with this palette porcelain is going to
help me to blend out that rust shade
that's so pigmented and also highlight
under the brow bone and I really like
how that worked out as well as a
highlight I'm going to use dust that was
recommended in the tips and tricks for
this palette and I think it gives a
really beautiful glow to the skin I like
it a lot this is the finished look with
liner and lashes I really do like how
this came out this is definitely my
favorite eye look that I did with this
palette and this is me trying to make
sexy faces and look like a beauty guru
which I don't know how successful that
was but but I do hope you enjoyed the
demo so we've gone over all the basics
about this palette we've gone over the
swatches and the demo now I'm going to
give you my full review of how I feel
about this palette I will tell you the
first three or four times they use this
how it I absolutely hated it I hated it
it was making my life miserable look
what is going on with this thing why
can't I make it work it was making me so
incredibly mad
because I just couldn't figure out what
to do with it to get it to work bitch
the big trick this is the big thing that
I said in the demo is it you need
glitter glue you have to have glitter
glue in some form the two-faced one is
fantastic the one I use in the demo was
from silk naturals my friend Lupe she
was like you got to get the next one and
try it out and I went to like three
different stores and couldn't find the
next one
to make sure that it worked but I trust
Lupe when she says the NYX Twitter glue
is fabulous so what you want to do is
you want to lay down
whatever matte base you're going to use
you saw how I laid mine down the demo
but you do want to lay down some kind of
matte base to go with the shimmers or
else you're going to look like a
glittery craziness I mean unless you
like that look if you like that look I'm
not judging you but for me that's not a
look that I prefer I prefer to lay down
some kind of substance before I throw
the glitter on top I have used this in
conjunction with other palettes and I do
find that it's nice to just put one of
these toppers on top of let's say a
Juvia splays palette with loss of color
or you know even another neutral I look
from like let's say a two-faced palette
it will give it a little bit of extra
spice and I find myself gravitating more
toward these toppers than I thought I
would because they are lighter than a
lot of the things in the palette and I
prefer for the most part lighter looks
in the end I feel like this palette is
for people that don't mind figuring out
how a palette works in order to enjoy it
I feel like there's definitely a
learning curve with this at least it was
for me if you got this and you knew how
to use it right off the bat
congratulations to you you are a better
woman or man than I because that was not
my experience with it but I definitely
do not recommend this for beginners
unless you're going to just maybe pull
one of these shades out in with another
palette then you may enjoy it if you
want something more complex something
different if you have a lot of
experience with makeup you're probably
really going to love this palette I
don't find it to be user friendly which
is a huge bust for me I don't like the
Kat Von D didn't give anybody any help
with how to use this that was a huge
fail I don't know what she was doing
because as I see
her is being a very good teacher when it
comes to giving information to her
consumers about how her products work
and I don't know what happened with this
and I'm very disappointed in that I know
I've mentioned like a million times but
I'm like oh I'm at one because I do love
gap buy the products and I just I know
how that happened the lasting power on
this palette is really good again if you
use the glitter glue if you don't use
the glitter glue the colors may stay
around they do stick around quite a bit
but the fallout is insane you know
quality wise blendability wise I haven't
had the worst time with it after I've
played with it quite a bit but before
that my looks were just coming out a
mess and they were coming out either
extremely ordinary and boring or they
were coming out so complex that they
didn't look good you know they just look
bad I'm reviewing this for the average
makeup consumer so for the average
consumer I'm only going to give this a
to heart rating just because of the
complexity of using it if you are an
experienced makeup person I would give
it maybe a four I think it depends on
what your purpose is for this palette
what you want to use it for if you are
used to a lot of neutral looks and you
just want to add that pop of shimmer and
shine you will probably like having this
so you just kind of to look inside
yourself and decide which person you are
and whether this would be something that
you would use or not now that I figured
it out I am thankful to have it because
I feel like it adds an extra tool to my
tool belt so is this a recommend for
some people not for others that's it for
my Kat Von D shade + light glimmer
palette review I hope you enjoyed it and
found it helpful if you did definitely
make sure you give this video a thumbs
up because it makes me look super cool
hit the subscribe button for more
reviews in the near future including my
thoughts on the anasazi bubbly whole
subculture palette I know that it's been
done to death
but I still keep getting lots and lots
of requests for it so I'm still willing
to do it and I hope that wherever you
are you are having a wonderful day or
evening and mad love to you and I will
see you in a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
