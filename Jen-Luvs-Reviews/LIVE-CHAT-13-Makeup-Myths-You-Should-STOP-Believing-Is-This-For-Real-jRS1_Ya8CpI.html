Charlie and Marilyn and squeaky little

Teresa MO who was one of our fabulous
contributors on the whatsapp and makeup
Facebook hunters group and everybody
else that I did not say hello to you
hello to you welcome I really like these
articles that are written because you
never know who's writing them when we
did last week for tips of people for
people over 40 I felt it was somebody
that was well way way younger than 40 I
thought it was really interesting her
perspective on tips something we agreed
some of them we didn't but we're see if
we agree with them this week I don't
know if it's the same author it looks
like it's a different author her name is
Lauren Epstein or Epstein EPS teim she
says it's time to ditch the bad beauty
advice that's keeping you from reaching
full gorgeous potential the first make
up myth is your concealer should be
lighter than your skin tone raise your
hands if your concealer is lighter than
your skin tone I'm gonna keep mine up my
concealer is lighter than my skin tone I
like the way that that looks I think it
depends on what your purposes for your
concealer is your concealers purpose
truly to conceal or is your concealers
purpose to brighten the under eye area
hold on a minute
my my daughter's friend's mother is
texting me I'm in a live chat I'll get
her to do it in about an hour I want to
respond to her so I don't forget so she
knows I'm not ignoring her but yeah I
feel like color correcting color
correcting is a reason why we should
maybe use one that's our skin tone but I
really feel like color correctors the
ones that are different colors are
really good a lot of times for that or a
color correcting concealer like I know
that Yves pearl makes a good color
correcting concealer that has a little
bit of a peach tone for people that need
that so I feel like you know for me I'm
not really hiding much under my under
eyes I am worried
getting there for I a concealer that is
lighter than my skin tone I feel like
this concealer that is the same color as
my skin tone there's really no purpose
for it for me so that's just that's
where I'm at I want to see what people
are saying Lily Anne which I'm hoping
that I'm saying that right it might be
illy Anne it might be Lily Anne that
myth should stay ad demented say add
dimension to the face yeah I mean I
think it just you like I think what
you're trying to say is that when you
the concealer can add dimension to your
face if you're trying to brighten the
under eye area I think that might be
what you're trying to say finesse says
yeah it is but I also have one my skin
tone as well yes I do too and I don't
feel like I need it very often
beautification ritual my concealer and
foundation match my skin tone okay so
let's see and then
Primrose kisses says I have to I have
one to Brighton and one to actually
conceal and I feel like that's what I
think a lot of people do and I think it
just depends on your own personal needs
you know and where your add as far as
what you need in your life
anastacio says or anastasia i'm not sure
how you pronounce it 1/1 dark circles
etc one for dark circles yes sherry says
or cherry says nope almost impossible to
find a shade lighter than my skin tone
that is not white there you go Oh Cheryl
says yea or nay Nicole's in the house
good to see you good to see you Cheryl
as well let's see Beth I use a color
corrector for dark circles then
concealer to brighten yeah and I felt a
lot of people kind of do that Naomi I
only use traditional concealers match to
skin tone when I'm not wearing any other
makeup and I have done that as well
where I use one that's close to my skin
tone and that I don't wear foundation
but some people don't want to do that
some people have you know maybe
discoloration that they want to cover
with foundation all the time so maybe
concealer isn't enough but I have
definitely just used concealer where I
put a little concealer here I put a
little bit here kind of to cover up any
redness any other red spots and then
just kind of blend it out and I've done
that but I think that one's going to be
a personal preference kind of thing
Sarah at the beauty hub says I also feel
like I am so pale that if I go brighter
it looks super strange and that makes
sense to Natalie hey Natalie my
concealers primarily used to brighten my
concealers lighter than my skin yeah so
definitely you know I feel like that one
is it's up to your personal alright
let's go on to the next one makeup myth
always line your lips before applying
lipstick
do you always line your lips for
applying lipstick I'm going to read what
they say pre lipstick liner is supposed
to create definition around your kisser
and keep your lipstick from feathering
unfortunately the liner which tends to
outlast the lip color can leave a ring
around your lips once the lipstick wears
off first apply your lipstick then use
your liner to define the outside rim of
your lips this Ungaro I guess as a
makeup artist suggests looking for
chemical free lipstick option try our
recipe for a DIY beet lipstick okay
read the concealer thing one but they
were basically saying that you know you
need a lighter shade only makes your
under eyes look ashy and blue according
to their makeup artist but I mean anyway
so the lip liner thing I do not use lip
liners but when I do I don't just use
them to outline my lips and they don't
know like when I've seen tutorials on
lining things I don't they're I very
rarely will see someone use a lip liner
just on the outside their lips usually
people will use a lip liner to define
and then color in so that would kind of
balance out this whole thing about that
it's going to be just on the outline of
your lips and everything else will fade
and you'll end up with this ring around
your lips if you use the lip liner all
over as kind of a base for your lipstick
then that negates that problem in my
opinion that's kind of where I'm at on
it why not use lip liners all that often
I feel like lip liners are most
important for me when I wear a dark
color I don't wear dark colors all that
off him Tania says i line my lip lip
liner and then fill it in yeah exactly
anastasia and seam liners and oh wait
i'm not quite sure what you're saying
there
i'm sorry i'm not comprehending for some
reason nikki i generally color in all of
my lips with lip liner then apply my
lipstick and then when it fades I still
have a lip liner color yes exactly
that's exactly what I do exactly
Brittney I feel like using a lip liner
on the outside of your lips is a very
90s thing to do yes and I remember when
I was in college my best friend Wendy
she used to do the dark lip liner with
the light lipstick on the inside and I
like one day I just broke down she was
like girlfriend I was like we got to do
something about this I was like we've
got a break out of this let's let's try
something new like I'm not saying you
know you need to ditch it forever
I'm just saying can we try something new
with the lips I think it would look
really good if we did something
different I forgetting my exact words
but I was like girl we got to update
this lip look here and I wasn't even
really into makeup that much but I was
you know I looked at trends and things
like that even though I wasn't like
super into makeup back then but yeah I
feel like it is kind of 90s but a lot of
90 stuff is definitely coming back in
definitely coming back in Moorea only
line with a very light colors to add
dimension
use darker colors more like stains Pat
the pigment on so I don't use them okay
there you go
that works let's see Monica I have to
line because my lips are thin and I have
to line them for contouring for your
lips that makes perfect sense that makes
perfect sense I mean I feel like you
know you really need some people I feel
like would want to use lip liner more
than others and it's just not really my
thing in general let's probably the
flash flood warning in the area okay
flash flood warning in the area tab I
see you um so uh but yeah but anyway oh
sure Lee's here hi Sharlee I had my
granddaughter this afternoon she just
went home Oh home very nice alright
let's go to the next rule because I do
feel like if you do just outline the
outer part of your lips that it could
definitely do that but I think that much
your phanie not anybody I'm sure some
people do but I feel like a lot of
people color in their lip with the lip
liner at this point alright this one is
definitely something I think we're all
going to agree on this I would dare to
say 99% of us if not a hundred percent
of us are going to agree on this makeup
myth pumping your mascara wand helps
spread the product attention long lash
lovers do not pump your mascara wand
into its tube you may think this
strategy helps get more mascara on the
wand or distributes it evenly across the
length of the wand but according to
Ungaro their makeup artist the pumping
action just pushes air into the tube
which dries out your mascara faster
check out these other tricks before
extending the shelf life you beauty
products and then they have a link I
think we all agree that that one is very
very very true at least I would imagine
that's that's my thought
yeah you don't don't want to pump your
mascara don't do that no no no no no no
pumping of the mascara it's not a good
idea
Linda says swirl the one the tube I
agree I agree yep everybody's like yes
dries out and adds bacteria yes do not
pump your mascara and I know why you
used to do that a long time ago I used
to do that absolutely rising of my
teenage self sarah says yup you know we
don't you know that yeah you were
twister swirl exactly and then just kind
of I usually wipe off the excess on the
of the tube or on like a tissue yep Don
agrees Christie says also sounds
horrible IV I know you know what though
sometimes the formula so what you wanted
to dry out a little bit well that's a
good point that's a good point IV this
is why the collective brain is here
because that's that is a really good
point that I hadn't thought of
she's a thinker she's a thinker Erin can
you send some water to Alberta police
for desperate oh my gosh I drove through
flooding flood like the sheets of rains
you get here I just got my hair done you
see all my Gray's are gone my Gray's are
gone and then she curled my hair for me
so we put my hair up in a up in a would
you call it a shower cap so that my hair
wouldn't get all nasty but it's still
kind of I lost a lot of the curl that
she put in oh well but yeah we have
we've had a lot of rain lots and lots of
rain here all right
crafty woman says my hair looks great
thank you so much Jamie Jamie and Brian
I'm suit maybe this is Jamie maybe this
is Brian I swear all mine you're good
I swear mine too and I says true my bad
gal bang took a week or so to break down
yeah and some kind sometimes mascaras
too sometimes my scared to do all right
let's move on to the next one makeup
myth apply concealer before foundation
that is the myth in some cases applying
concealer before foundation can wipe the
concealer away aren't Ungaro warrants
try her trick instead apply foundation
all over first then assess your face in
the mirror you may not need as much
concealer as you think Dad would only in
the areas where it's needed plus Ungaro
adds concealer is thicker than
foundation so this technique will look
much more natural so do you put your
concealer on before foundation or after
foundation I usually put mine on after I
have tried before foundation before and
I did not like it I did not like the way
that it looked I personally prefer to do
it after and I think that that's because
I primarily am using it for brightening
if you're using it for color correcting
then I can see why that might be a
choice that you would make but for me I
don't
I don't do that I put it on after
because I'm using it to brighten don't
tell any of the people that make YouTube
tutorials that they shouldn't be using
so much concealer though I'm sure that
they would get upset sometimes to see we
talked about this last week a lot of
concealer in some of these videos you
know tart shaped tape totally completely
filled in triangle doubt all on the
forehead down the nose in here and it's
like oh like if I did that I would look
crazy like but they look gorgeous they
look amazing they look absolutely
amazing let's see beautification ritual
depends on the foundation I'm using
brand and coverage that's a good point
Melissa I used to put concealer on
before foundation back in high school
there you go Nicole does it after hi
Nicole
we need to catch up we need to talk on
the phone soon I see you comments have
to do it last because of fallout yeah
that's a good point and that's one thing
I've been trying to remember to do it's
to G my foundation concealer after my
eye shadow but I always forget like I
it's just it's not my routine it's not
what I do it's not what I do
Sue's please sometimes I put on before
because I'm lazy and I'm more careful
blending concealer when it's on top of
foundation if that makes sense that does
make sense
Neela I like my triangles I like my
triangles too I'm with you and I'm
totally with you I like cuz I use it for
brightening and I feel like the triangle
is like but I can't do it with like
shape tape like I can do it with my
color pot I've been doing it with my
makeup revolution one I've been doing it
with the Urban Decay Naked skin that
would I definitely feel like I need to
do like the full-on triangle but like I
was specifically talk about shape tape
because that stuff is so incredibly
intense I can't do it with shape tape I
can't do it it's horrible
if the result comes out terrible on me
and maybe it's my application method
maybe I just don't know how to do it
properly which is totally a possibility
completely a possibility let's see I'm
gonna try to say this mal a chain I like
my foundation before my eyes and then
concealer after gotcha that's smart
because then if you have just a little
bit of fog you can you can cover that up
or get rid of that Sara
if I do my eyeshadow them face makeup I
always forget my eyebrows and that you
know what I forgot to do my eyebrows
today I got home this is my five minute
makeup look like this was one even five
minutes I have two colors on my eyes
I've got my crease and my lid I used the
color pop what you call it then you had
me at hello palette and I just put a
shade my crease shade on my lid a little
liner a little mascara little lips and
done I think you everything so I
completely forgot to do my brows oh well
but I hear you I totally hear you
Christine says took me a while but now I
do eyes first there you go
Cheyenne spot conceal for acne etc
before brightening for under-eye after
there you go there you go
that makes sense all right and if you're
watching this on the replay feel free to
leave your thoughts about these in the
comments below as many comments as you
want
as many comments as you want to leave
makes me look cooler makeup myth dust
your whole face with bronzer to look tan
I used to do this bad idea unless you
want to look like a Barbie doll who
swapped heads with a friend thing is
brushing your bronzer onto your entire
face creates that dreaded line of
demarcation between your face and your
neck like an orange mask says Ungaro
from more natural believable globe dust
bronzer over areas of your face that
someone actually hit it like the bridge
of your nose forehead cheeks and chin I
have a really funny story about that one
I was probably about 16 I went to the
mall and when I went to the mall I saw
this girl who was working at the mall
and I thought she was the most beautiful
girl she was so beautiful and her face
was more tan than her neck it's like but
man does she looks so pretty you know
with her face that color like she's so
pretty
I was er I want to look just like that
so I started using bronzer all over my
face to try to look like this girl that
I saw at the mall and I was like it
didn't look that bad with her neck being
a completely different color than her
face like her face was so pretty so I
started doing that and then eventually I
don't know why I stopped I think I just
started getting lazy but I think I
always thought it looks good but yeah I
was always trying to look like this girl
I saw at the mall who totally had a
different color face than her neck I
thought she looked good I did genuinely
no one ever told me no one ever told me
that that was a bad thing
like ever ever Monica I love my betty
loumanizer all over my face for bronzer
I love the glow and I think it just
depends on like how what your skin tone
is too you know the floating head I call
it neck face that's what I call it now
neck face and your face is different
color than your neck
kay says I use a very cool tube bronzer
from Physicians Formula and use it for
contour there you go
Linda I call that the floating head yep
green eyes I highlight I don't contour
use bronzer call me check these stripes
of bronze on my forehead I'm like no
that doesn't actually look good and I
won't even talk about the time I tried
to contour my nose that went really
really badly Oh bad idea bad prom
primrose kisses bronzers trial-and-error
I totally agree totally agree Julie it
doesn't matter what bronzer I use I look
like I've dirt all over my forehead yeah
me too where where I'm me too on that
one I'm totally with you Nikolas life I
always dust my whole face with bronzer
because I'm not able to match my
foundation right and it's always too
like yeah and I think that yeah exactly
like what you're saying I feel like it's
to the individual person I think that it
that it can work for some people and not
work for other people Robbie says
contour highlight then apply bronzer all
over I think as long as like you don't
have that floating head look but if you
like the floating head look you do you
but I feel like as long as you don't
have that completely different neck face
situation going on you can bronze
especially you're trying to match like
that makes perfect sense to me
Erica focusing on the temples looks best
for my face shape there you go Emily
says we should all look like the skin we
have skin color we have yeah I mean I
well see I come from we talked about
this last week too I come from you know
the the generation being a child where
you know I was I talked about last week
someone send too much time I used to get
made fun of for being so pale my
grandmother used to tease me about it my
parents occasionally would tease me
about especially my father who was my
grandmother's son you know so for me
bronze and tan and deeper skin has
always been
like a goal for me personally you know
like that's always been something that
I've been jealous of people when I see
that they have naturally bronzed and
golden skin always like like man I wish
I could have deeper and you know what I
mean like just because that was a way I
was raised in that I was kind of shamed
for being pale so I feel like it's still
in me somewhere like for myself
personally like I feel like it's still
in my gut somewhere and I try to push it
away as much as possible so I definitely
feel like you know we need to appreciate
who we are as people and I'm totally
with you you know appreciating whatever
skin tone skin color you have
but highlighting you know doing
highlighter and blush and contour and
all of that if it makes people happy I
have no problem with that or you know
even you know self-tanning and things if
it makes people happy they should do
what makes them happy you know so I
don't know that's just that's just where
I'm at sometimes I you know go into a
little bit a lot of detail but I want
you guys to know me for who I am you
know even if I'm not perfect because I'm
not none of us are you know alright
Terry says I understand growing up
wanting be more tan my mother's
Brazilian and the golden goddess I'm
much lighter complected so now I wear
self-tanner all year yeah yeah Peggy
says I'm oh I'm so pale I'm almost
reflective and I'd like you know there's
you guys know there are beautiful people
of all skin tones it doesn't I hope
nobody's misinterpreting what I'm saying
here all right
Ivy says I like my skin now awesome I
hope nobody misinterprets what I'm
saying alright let's go on to the next
one makeup myth all natural products are
safest all natural products are safest
is the myth
not so fast a product might be 100% au
naturale but that doesn't mean you won't
have a bad reaction to it says Samantha
jozek a makeup artist at Rouge New York
makeup salon if you've experienced this
comfort or reactions to beauty products
in the past
jozek suggests visiting your local
allergist and getting tested to find out
what really does and doesn't work for
you the truth is that a product from
your dermatologist
just might work better for you than one
from the local organic market depending
on your sensitivities I totally agree
with that I mean I don't think you know
you don't want poison ivy skin lotion
you know it's natural but you don't want
that and also when something says that
it's natural chances are its what is
with the percentage like 30% natural in
order to be able to say that it's
natural I know it's pretty low I don't
know what off the top of my head which
one it is but even products that say
that they're natural still have things
that are not natural in them you know so
I I definitely you know I don't think
that all natural is definitely the best
at all peggy breaks out more if she uses
natural products interesting Brittany I
hate the all-natural root essential oils
are all natural but they're actually one
of the most likely things to cause
irritation look a grapefruit or citrus
oils you can get dermatitis for them yes
and that's part of some of the research
that I've done
unlike Lynn Yule which is a fragrance
you know citrus oils things like that
lavender oil a lot of those can cause
skin sensitivity at least there's
research behind it some people disagree
with the research but there is some
research there Christine says natural is
a mean English term relatively
relatively I think that there are
definitely some cosmetic companies that
are more natural than others there's
definitely some labs out there that go
more natural than others they use more
natural ingredients but I think when you
use more natural ingredients a lot of
times you lose the effectiveness of the
product you lose you know that it
actually works well I like for example
Ilya beauty Ilya beauty is a company
that sent me a ton of stuff and though
it's very beautiful for a very light
look like if you like that really
natural look a lot of it is you know
pigmented wise it's it's kind of weak
you know like it's it's very
natural-looking on you because they use
a lot of natural ingredients so there
really isn't a ton of pigmentation and
the products and some people just don't
want that so you kind of have to decide
you know what's more important to you
but some people very much believe in
using much
our natural products in skincare and on
you know makeup products and all of that
and I think you just have to go with
what you believe is best for you I just
feel like you know I don't know there's
just there's there's definitely some
chemicals out there like bismuth
oxychloride that are just absolutely
awful for some people and cause all
kinds of rashes and irritations but then
some people it does absolutely nothing
for them I can use bismuth oxychloride I
can be perfectly fine you know so I
think you just have to do you and I
don't think there's anything wrong with
going the natural route but I don't
think that it's an end-all be-all that
if you you know if you're using natural
products that you're gonna be okay
you know that that you're doing
something better than the people that
aren't using the all natural or all
natural which is usually about 30 50
percent natural products you know
anything like I don't know that's where
I'm at
let's see Naomi the only natural company
I've liked was a hundred percent pure
natural plant waxes and pigments but not
scented Beauty pedia doesn't trust them
though oh good to know Erica I have very
sensitive skin so some things have to be
natural for me and other stuff breaks me
out yeah so it's it like I'm saying it's
totally an individual thing I feel like
and a natural but safe beauty products
please yes and I don't see anything
wrong with natural but safe beauty
products you just have to you have to do
trial and error and do your own research
into what's good what's not good trying
to think off the top of my head some
good websites that I look at I mean I'm
Adam I'm on PubMed so much reading these
articles on PubMed for these different
ingredients and things PubMed is super
reliable but yeah I mean there's just
there's so many places you can look you
know you have to like there's there's
different blogs that are really good
like beautiful with brains is amazing
you know cos DNA cos DNA is is hit and
miss cost DNA goes off of ewg and ewg
sometimes exacerbates things so I don't
really trust cos DNA cos DNA is like
like they'll take a study that was done
100%
tration on a rat and it was harmful to
the rat so then they'll say that it was
bad for people that when it's mixed in
beauty products you know like so they
they sometimes I feel like heightened an
issue but then sometimes I feel like
they don't address issues that they
should that have been found other times
to be bad you know I don't really trust
cost the any as much I do look at cost
DNA I look at that to kind of see if
there's anything that they're labeling
in an ingredient list as bad as like a
starting point to do more research into
it but I don't trust them off their face
Patrese pretty much I'm allergic to the
smell of jasmine for example I have to
label read everything it's a migraine
trigger for me which is unfortunate
because I love the smell of jasmine oh
man and that's a natural thing you know
I hear her yeah alright see this one's
really funny remember this one was
linked to the article from last week
make up myth women over 40 can't do
shimmer the article from last week that
linked this article said that women over
40 shouldn't be doing shimmer and now
this one says women over 40 can't do
shimmer that's a myth they say go for it
says new york-based makeup artist and
beauty expert Amanda Christian Burt
Buren Iran Baron who celebrity clients
include Beauty Sarah Jessica Parker
Natalie Portman and Sheryl Crow gold
peach Brown Burgundy all look amazing
and sexy on the eye she says no matter
what age you are Buren has a trick for
keeping your eyeshadow on point apply a
matte base color and blend a colored
shimmer shadow over it focus on the
lower part of your lid and blend up into
the crease of the eye then brush a super
light highlight shadow under the brow
bone to bring the whole look together
voila I totally agree that women over 40
can definitely wear shimmer better be
because I am gonna be I don't wear
shimmer and forever forever no one's
taking my shimmer away nobody I don't
care
yup I'll be shimmering at 80 you know it
glow to the gods Steph you know it yes
surely I like a little shimmer but will
not use foiled shadows too much for my
liking see I like foiled shadows but I
think that it's just it's a personal
preference thing I don't think people
should be discouraged to use shimmer
over 40 or over 50 or over 80 I feel
like you should wear what makes you
happy the logic behind it is that it
accentuates texture and it can
accentuate texture but you have to do
what you like and what you enjoy and if
you feel comfortable and happy glow into
the gods you should that's my opinion
that's where I'm at it's much Polly says
I can't keep my language polite to the
person who say we can't wear shimmer I
can't either
I'm with you Angie ha I'm 51 and I
shimmer shimmer shimmer all day every
day you go Angie high five - Angie BAM
that's for you Stef says you have to
experiment some highlighters embassy
emphasize texture I agree and I feel
like and you can definitely correct me
if you feel like this is not true for
you I feel like liquid highlighters tend
to accentuate texture more than powder
highlighters pores wrinkles all of that
I feel like liquid highlighters are like
I have much more trouble with liquid
highlighters than I do powder
highlighters some powder highlighter is
definitely accentuate but I always feel
like a liquid highlighter just brings
everything to the surface Georgina I
gave my mom a makeover for Mother's Day
and I've never seen her look so youthful
shimmers made her eyes pop yes awkward
beauty bye Allie I like shimmer but not
always foil
I love the foils man I can't get enough
of the foils love me some foils I can't
I can't stop eyewear for it foils all
day every day if I could just says my
mom is 70 and she loves shimmer death
Natalie I think we're all kind of on the
same page here Nancy cream highlighter
works best for me oh well that's good to
know so there you go
so everybody's different you know Suze
please highlighter with chunky glitter
emphasize my texture yes
frog push because like liquid it fills
in the dips that makes sense
that makes sense Natalie I think that
soft shimmers and satins are more
flattering especially on women in their
60s plus mattes can look choppy and be
drying to the delicate lids that make
sense it makes sense
all right let's go to the next one
makeup myth you need foundation for a
complete look if you take good care of
your skin you probably don't need a
thick spackling a foundation to pull off
the flawless finish
oh oh that just hit a sore spot Oh
cringe cringe cringe okay
that's suggesting that people who have
skin problems are not taking care of
their skin
sorry Mayank I hadn't read this yet and
I am like that kind of stuff sets me off
it makes me so upset because just
because someone has blemishes or someone
has discoloration or some what does not
mean they are not taking care of their
skin some people are genetically
predisposed to different skin things
that might be happening sometimes people
that have perfect looking skin and don't
take care of their skin so that bothers
me that line that just I'm gonna have to
move past that because that's not what
this is about but that just made me
sorry
like oh you kidding me you kidding me I
mean yes it's possible that's the reason
why your skin maybe has issues but
that's not always the case and I think a
lot of times that's not the case
Debbie says I have a slight allergy to
chocolate so if I eat it I break out
doesn't mean I don't take care of my
skin there you go good points Emmy
Natalie I take care of my skin and have
rosacea acts up when it yeah exactly
that's what I'm saying that's exactly
what I'm saying sorry that just totally
made me go oh all right let's move
trying to move past that it says in fact
they could easily make you look overdone
Buuren says to skip the foundation and
try a tinted moisturizer a rich
nourishing face cream or a very shared
dewy foundation just a few drops to let
your natural skin shine through it's
beautiful to have healthy skin and show
it Buren says a tinted moisturizer gives
the face a sheen that looks youthful for
an extra special touch apply a light
shimmer highlighter to the outer
I to brighten the whole face skip the
powder if you want to keep your natural
glow and try one or more of these 19 no
makeup makeup tricks that might be a
good one for next chat 19 no makeup
makeup tricks let's put that in a tab
save that for later so this is this is
the way I feel about this I feel like
with foundation that you need to do what
makes you feel comfortable and happy if
you feel like foundation is going to
help you to feel like your skin tone is
more even making sure that if you like
the look of foundation I have no problem
with it does everybody need foundation
no I agree with that not everybody needs
foundation
nobody technically needs foundation
nobody on the planet needs foundation
but you might want foundation if it
makes you happy for one reason or
another but you know like right now I'm
not wearing any foundation do I need
foundation no if I had discoloration
what I need foundation no am i
comfortable right now am I happy yes I
am happy you know but I happen to not
have a lot of discoloration into so
depending on your own skin you may
choose to want to wear foundation you
know but I can I can see what they're
saying as far as like too much
foundation can make you look like you're
wearing too much makeup to some people
and I can kind of see that Maria says
your skin is gorgeous thank you thank
you very much Sheila sometimes I spot
conceal and keep going yes meet you
Sheila Steph I never wear a makeup what
oh I never knew her makeup if I've acne
I find it better for my skin to breathe
that's a good point to Marinella I like
the idea of foundation even though
people keep saying I don't need it I do
admit I do not I don't always wear it
but I love to wear it there you go hi
Daniel I'm sorry if I if I'm going to

community for a really long time I'm
just happy that you're here
Kelsie when is your drunk elephant video
coming up because your skin does look
amazing I I want to do it before I leave
at the end of the month I was actually
just thinking about it the other day I
need to start doing the research on it
and making sure I've got all my ducks in
a row as far as the ingredients of
everything but I don't want it to be too
terribly long so I'm gonna have to
figure out how I'm gonna do that because
there's definitely products I like more
than others products that I feel like
are more beneficial than others ones I
feel like you can skip especially if you
own one you don't need the other things
like that but I'm gonna I'm working on
it I'm working on I do really like the
stuff overall
Tiffany PK I go without all the time I
usually use it when I want an amped-up
face there you go
there you go all right let's move on to
the next one I don't know how many we
have left at this point
all right makeup myth real women can't
pull off a smoky eye who in the world
would say that real women can't pull off
a smoky eye I guess they're saying that
the smoky eye is more glamorous so it
should be saved for more glamorous women
but okay it says Believe It or Not a
dark sexy smoky eye isn't just for
models and movie stars who apparently
aren't real women according to its
author
according to Buehring the best way to
achieve a professional-looking smoky
eyes to blend eyeliner with a great
eyeshadow brush or q-tip use a
high-quality eyeshadow that blends well
a dark brown or even black smokey eye is
modern and fun don't miss the makeup
tips that make you look amazing in
photographs that's another article and
they're just plugging all their articles
aren't they so I definitely think that
anybody can do a smoky eye I think that
they're fun they're very difficult for
me sometimes it depends I feel like
sometimes it can make me look overdone
like it can make me look like I've just
got too much going on where I don't
enjoy the way that I look
so I very rarely will do a full-on
smokey eye especially the ones where
they have the lower lash line completely
lined out I feel like sometimes that
just can make my eyes look really small
and it just looks overdone so I don't
personally enjoy like full-on smokey eye
on me
I really definitely think that um
anybody can do a smoky eye if they want
to amanda says I've no lid space but bag
that can make it a little more difficult
definitely Laura I like wearing colorful
smoky eyes there you go are you still
reading the smoky eye is my only eye
look took years to learn and now I can't
stop nice yeah I do cat eyes that's what
I do all the time is cat eyes that's
that's my thing
staff a real woman can wear whatever the
heck she wants amen amen high five is
death totally agree totally agree nanny
I find a blended smoky eye harder than a
full-blown cut crease really Wow
Dahlia my smoky eye doesn't look good
all the time but I still feel sexy with
one oh that's so awesome
Erica I'm a raccoon with a smoky eye but
I still do it because I want to look as
dramatic as I am oh that's so cool I
love that KC I wore smoky eye every day
one year in high school it was just my
style emo life go ahead love it love it
love it
Linda I feel like smoking out my lower
lashline makes my eyes look smaller me
too me too totally totally agree
definitely therese says my eyes tear too
much that makes sense
Beth I'm known for my smoky eyes I rock
it every day good for you Rachel I love
smoky I'm 46 yeah I don't the way that
some of this stuff is worded it's like
girl let me help you with your wording a
little bit a man's I put liner on and
with my eyes open that's all you can see
yeah mm-hmm Nicole a true smoky eye will
make my eyes look so much smaller so I
don't do them often yeah I mean that
makes sense that makes perfect sense
Nicole is is beautiful blonde she's
gorgeous if we want to see Nicole you
can go over the a or nay Nicole her
YouTube channel she's gorgeous gorgeous
just saying she's my friend so let's say
that Florie says what makes us not real
women I know I know
well they're saying that the real women
they're saying the people that aren't
real women are the movie stars is what
they're trying to say like movie stars
and models and they're comparing to real
women which would be us who are not
movie stars and models that's what
they're saying yeah I don't know
says testing Pat McGrath today it's kind
of a smoky eye seven hours no primer and
still looking great that is awesome
fabulous all right let's go to the next
one makeup myth oh I think I think we're
all gonna agree on this one too if I can
get my thing to scroll makeup myth
expensive brands work better no need to
break the banks get your beauty on there
are good and bad products at all price
ranges Amen says Michelle green go
Michelle green a cosmetic district
dermatologist in New York City in fact
many of the active ingredients in
anti-aging skincare products are the
same no matter where you buy them or how
much they cost while sure expensive
products are going to work for you so
will some of the much cheaper options
that would be a good video is to look at
drugstore skincare and see which ones
compared to the ingredient list that
I've seen in some high-end but
significantly more effective than the
lock seat on one the lots of time one is
what I don't know and you get like half
as much and stuff to pay more for it and
you have to figure out what works for
you and I do feel like with cosmetics
specifically makeup I feel like there's
a lot of excellent drugstore products
especially when we're talking mascara
when we're talking lipstick I feel like
you can find some really good options in
the drugstore
I don't know but sometimes they look
good high-end lipstick just has that
creaminess to it that just makes it like
mmm but yeah I mean it there's C
eyeshadow I feel like a lot of times I
like it better the high-end ones better
but mascara is definitely something I
feel like you do not need to buy
high-end mascara there's so many good
drugstore mascaras out there so many
really really good ones like Jordana
bass classic scream I think is like 3
bucks it's amazing so I mean but as far
as skincare I would have to look more
into that and look at the ingredients
but I do know like for example like I'm
looking a little bit drunk elephant
stuff when I looked at the locked-on
stuff there is definitely ingredients
and high-end skincare that I would
imagine is not in drugstore skincare but
I have to I would have to research it I
would have to look more into it and see
what people are saying Erica I've talked
to Erica ah
err
has been all up in here elfin
wet-and-wild are mostly all of my
collection I get complements daily I
love my high-end stuff like eyeshadow
palettes but not necessarily by any
means yeah there you go
and also it's how long you want it to
last because my biggest critique with
drugstore eyeshadow is the lasting power
I can get a really beautiful look out of
a lot of drugstore eyeshadows but it
only lasts me like six hours before it
starts to fade we're a high-end
eyeshadow a lot of times will last a lot
longer so I guess it just depends on
what you're looking for if you're only
looking to have it on for six to eight
hours then a drugstore eyeshadow may be
perfectly fine you know and then you
have drugstore price eye shadows like I
really love the morphe jacqueline hill
palette dubious place i shadow palettes
super inexpensive compared to high-end
and there are just as good quality in my
opinion Christie melt stacked smile
stocks are sick they're so good calla
lily calla lily may have more pigment
yes frog push trying to find a good lip
liner I wish I could tell you I'm not
I'm not a lip liner kind of person Steph
I find out over the years you really
have to do your research try things in
experiment totally agree rachel says is
why I prefer old to over Sephora yeah
because you can get both price ranges
and the l'oreal lash paradise mascara
from l'oreal is amazing yes I agree it's
really good it's really good Christie
says to Jacqueline helped out was look
100 bucks in Canada that's insane I
wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for it
but I feel like 30s good genuine Jess
I'm so new to makeup so for me spending
forty five dollars an eyeshadow palette
is insane yeah I hear you I totally hear
you I mean I think that like it just
depends I feel like okay this is this is
my logic for spending forty five dollars
on an eyeshadow palette if you find an
eyeshadow palette you can use every
single day and be happy it's worth it
than buying three different drugstore
eyeshadow palettes that you're not happy
with for the same price that's the way I
feel can you hear the rain outside it
just started pouring pouring
Lupe
what's up Lupe if I use a good primer
and the shadows last the same whether
it's drugstore all right that's awesome
hi under drugstore Brittany my whole
collection is drugstore with very few
exceptions with the right primers and
setting sprays they can last all day
nice and you have to figure out what
works for you too I mean people with dry
lids people oily lids people like normal
lids like me I mean everybody's going to
have a different experience
Lisa off topic but I found a great deal
for benefit Porefessional primer nice
Lisa put it put it here so that people
can read it um Charlie $45 is my limit
for eyeshadow palettes I hear you I hear
you
Cristina Laura wet and wild the wet wild
waterproof she's talking about all right
let's see what the next one is but I
definitely agree especially with makeup
that expensive brands are not always
going to work better because there are a
lot of high-end products that are just
they don't work they're terrible I've
tried so many high-end products that are
not good at all at all all right make a
myth you don't need sunscreen if it's in
your foundation oh my gosh totally agree
with that makeup products have come a
long way to guarding your skin from the
Sun many foundations and tinted
moisturizers now offer SPF production
protection that may be enough if you're
sitting in a windowless cubicle all day
but if you're heading outdoors for more
than 10 minutes you need real sunscreen
totally agree makeup alone does not
provide enough protection from the Sun
Green says if you want to wear sunscreen
underneath your cause you want to wear
sunscreen underneath your cosmetics
sunscreen provides a good base for
makeup application absolutely 100% agree
with that I think sunscreen on your face
is critical you need to the the
sunscreen the amount of even if it says
SPF whatever I feel like the amount of
other things added into the foundations
and the tinted moisturizers it's not the
same as using a straight sunscreen you
know that's that's that's my opinion
Amanda can sunscreen break you out yeah
I'm sure it can break some people out
you have to find what works for you
absolutely ho no my daughter's texting
me
I have she wants an apple I have one cut
up next to me she can have it one cut up
next to me you can come in and get it
okay oops hold on a minute
oops I texted her friend mom for it's a
oops wrong person all right let me copy
this copy I texted her her friend's mom
instead of her oh come on all right
sorry
I have one I screwed again next to me
you can come in and get it sorry gotta
do the mommy thing okay but yeah Sun
screen is very very important mineral
sunscreen
let's see or audre says Dennis gross
mineral sun spray is awesome very cool
good to know Emily has anyone tried to
spray on SPF setting sprays what I
understand they're bad at setting makeup
but does the SPF work I have no idea
Aaron my sunscreen hunt has been
terrible everything breaks me out I just
got a new one from drunk elephant to try
good luck with that let me know how that
goes
keep me posted Kacie I'm an offender of
replacing sunscreens for foundation I
wore the Smashbox BB cream to Florida in

important you know so thank you thank
you thank you all right let's go to the
next one cuz we're running out of time
and I don't know how many of these we
have left
all right makeup mith lip plumpers work
don't be fooled by the pouty lip
advertisement lip plumpers don't
actually make your lips fuller rather
these products irritate your lips with
ingredients like menthol and hot pepper
said they become swollen temporarily
says dr. green which can be harmful the
only products that can plump your lips
are injectable fillers containing
hyaluronic acid like Juvederm vole Bella
which was just FDA approved the sheet
this year why don't know when this was
written
past the OTC plumpers and fake luscious
lips with a pretty lipstick and liner
pass on oh they're saying pass on them
while you're at it learn how to use with
another thing for and add for another
article okay so this is the thing lip
plumpers do temporarily can't wash as
they can temporarily plump your lips but
the effect doesn't last very long I did
do a video on the two-faced lip
injection extreme and what I did was I
did a time lapse so you can actually see
I did it super fast like I sped up the
footage you can see my lips plumping and
then I did a before and after next to
each other where you could see my face
was he my lips for the exact same size
and then you can see that they are
slightly larger I mean slightly slightly
larger and the two-faced lip injection
extreme does use the hot pepper to plump
your lips but the effect is again does
not last very long so if you're going to
do it for
the gram you know doing for Instagram
then you may want to try one if you want
it to last you all evening you're gonna
have to keep reapplying and keep
reapplying keep reapplying supposedly
some of those lip plumpers if you use
them all the time they will plump your
lips a little bit more permanently if
you continue to use them I believe the
logic behind it and please correct me if
I'm wrong because I don't like to give
bad information but what the logic
behind it is it supposed to increase the
blood flow to your lips which is what
makes it plump more and I don't think
the mint ones work my opinion they admit
ones do not work the ones that are like
the buxom but I do feel like the ones
with the pepper in them those do work
temporarily that's that's my personal
experience and from the research that I
did for that video callalily says if you
put hot pepper on your lips what happens
if you kiss someone well the thing that
happens is when you put it on it like
you'll see it and you have to that
videos really good so just go watch my
videos okay but but basically what
happens is is that it starts off where
you can't feel anything and then your
lips slowly start to burn and then it
like gets really intense and then it
slowly fades away so this all happens
within five minutes so when like I've
kissed my husband after he can't tell
like it doesn't it doesn't join me in
because he's past like I don't know but
he never had a problem like when I've
kissed him with that stuff on but yeah I
don't know I feel like it definitely
plumped my lips Casey says that you face
one plumped mine so unevenly it wasn't
worth it at all well that's good to know
that's good to know it definitely
plumped mine evenly I'll have to say
Kelly says okay I'll watch the vid but
you okay thanks no for the burning house
no burning no husband's no be terrible
Victoria mosquito got me on the lip once
and that works too it's not very
comfortable though I would agree I would
definitely not recommend bee stings or
mosquito bites on your lips to plump
them no no not at all / blue have burnt
my lips are strapped jalapenos my lips
were plumped I think it has to be
certain kinds I think it's
I think Cayenne I think is one of them
cayenne pepper I think is one of them oh
so are you still reading says I've
kissed my boyfriend wearing buxom it
makes his lip tingle well that one has
the mentholated the mint stuff so that
one may be a little bit different so Kay
says what about the Machine thing oh my
gosh the lip suckers have you seen the
lip suckers or you put the thing on here
and it gives you the boot whoops
learn it sometimes it'll have a little
line here and then the line will give
you like that little butt lip thing you
don't talk about the but let let goes
like this but it'll be plumped stuff the
lipstick those things freak me out okay
I have not researched them I have not
researched them so I want to tell you
this is from my impression this is
nothing this is not research-based I
feel like using those lip plumping
machine thingies those nude ones that
suck your lips out they do work you see
them they work but what in the world are
you doing to your skin you are pulling
your lip skin lip wrinkles lamp wrinkles
if you keep pulling your skin over and
over and over again it's it's gonna
shrink back you pull it out you shrink
it back pull it out shrink it back pull
it out shrink it back that is not that
cannot be good that cannot be good it
cannot be good for your lips I've had so
many of those companies reach out to me
for sponsored videos and I'm like no no
no no no no no but I'm not never never
never never but they do seem to work I
had theirs I've definitely seen people
use it on camera yeah Emily bust open
your capillaries and cause trauma to
your face no no no Barry says lmao I got
a lip hickey doing something oh and the
bruising it's gotta cause bruising I
don't know uh-uh Britney there we go
makeup by Britney just overdraw your
lips that's the safest way
Manny anyway we'll show you how to do it
he's the king of over drawing the lips
all right we got to move on because we
were running out of time oh my gosh
we'll only supposed to have two minutes
left let's see how many of these left
okay I've got one oh there's only one
left
perfect okay so makeup myth makeup harms
the skin is their myth chemicals and
ingredients and beauty products are
often scrutinized for being potentially
harmful to the skin and body but Linda
Mason I'm
Bart is from England who has worked with
an impressive array of ælis clients
including Kate Moss Brooke Shields and
Cameron Diaz says that makeup products
protects the skin from pollution and at
least a few makeup lines such as oxygen
etics provide legitimate skin benefits
but to keep skin as clear as possible
Mason recommends gently wiping off
makeup every night and rinsing with warm
water and a creamy cleanser I think that
that makes sense
I have not researched that but that
makes sense because there actually are
quite like there are a lot of
foundations that have humectants in them
that help to keep your skin hydrated and
balanced there's a lot of ingredients in
specifically foundations that can really
help your skin and be good for your skin
but the thing is is you definitely
definitely 100% need to wash off your
makeup at night you that that is a must
washing off foundation and makeup at
night is an absolute must
absolute but wait Naomi says only avoid
your irritation makeup for the most part
just sits on the epidermis yeah I mean
it's just sitting there exactly totally
with you but yeah I mean I don't think
that people should be using I wanna make
sure I'm clear on this I don't think
people should be using makeup as skin
care though I think that skin care is
really important but I don't but I what
I'm saying is that there are ingredients
that are in some foundations that do
have skin benefits but I don't think
that makeup overall should be used as
skin care want to make sure that I'm
good there make sure I sometimes live I
can't go back and edit and be like how
did I say that can I say it a little bit
better can I say it a little clearer
sometimes people take me super super
literally in live chat so it's it's hard
because it's live you know I can't edit
it out but yes washing off your makeup
is really important but I definitely
don't think that makeup is necessarily
bad for the skin unless you personally
are having an issue with it but I don't
I don't think I wouldn't imagine that it
would cause issues wearing makeup during
the day and then washing it off at night
so sniffs honey says I'm overdraw
my lips I'm going full drag-queen Yenta
from the nanny
Micheline says if it's just sitting
there on the skin wait he's just sitting
there if it's just sitting there are the
skin care classes a waste no I don't
think so
I wouldn't think that there are wastes I
feel like that it's not giving you a ton
of Awesomeness that what's the typical
skin care would but it's not bad you
know like it's not bad especially if
it's got like the humectants and stuff
in there what you won't really want to
watch out for the big big big bad from
my research the big bad is denatured
alcohol that's the one that can actually
damage your skin over time so you
definitely want to watch out for
denatured alcohol in your cosmetics it's
in so many things especially setting
sprays and it actually causes damage to
your skin over time that's the only
ingredient that I found that's common in
a lot of cosmetics face products that I
would definitely say can damage your
skin not all the alcohols just denatured
alcohol that's that's the big bad but
but yeah I should probably pop off here
Calo lino says it's still skincare on
your skin during the day yeah but I
think in general like doing your
skincare first your skincare routine
then putting your makeup on especially
your sunscreen then putting your makeup
on washing it off at night and then
putting your skin your night routine on
even if it's the same as your day
routine you know even if it's just a
moisturizer you know all right I'm gonna
pop off here hopefully I articulated
myself well today I feel like there was
a couple of times during this chat that
I just didn't articulate myself the way
that I want it like I would have if I
was editing this so I take take what I'm
saying with a grain of salt you know
know that that this is live and you know
it's live man yeah it's what it is but
but yeah I want to thank you so much for
watching I hope that you have fun today
I know I had fun hanging out with you
just a heads up there will be no one
