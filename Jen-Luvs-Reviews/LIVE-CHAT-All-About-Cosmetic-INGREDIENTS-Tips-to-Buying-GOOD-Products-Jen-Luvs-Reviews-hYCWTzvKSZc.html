the live chat weekly live chat and here
my voice is a little bit scratchy again
another night with not as much sleep
more sleep in typical but not as much
sleep as I get on not Saturday nights
trying to get ready yeah right somebody
I forget who it was I can't member what
her name was calling me out on Twitter
she's like girl you are up late and it's
like it just finished editing oh is
everybody this morning by the way skin
care tip get good sleep drink lots of
water not lots of coffee practicing when
I preach I need I need to do better at
that hopefully everybody's doing well
this morning today we're gonna be
focusing on ingredients and this stems
from a video that I did a livestream
yesterday with my FC bag I'm bagging and
I unbagged
this eye cream and I looked at it and I
was like oh so those are the ingredients
uh you know like this is like are you
kidding me so people were asking me can
you do a video all on ingredients so
that is why I'm doing this video I do
want to put this out there that I am NOT
a skincare expert I am NOT an
esthetician I am not formally trained in
any of this this is simply the reason
why this exists is because it's by
request there are so much better more
official ways of finding out from
official people um goth yzma I think is
what her name is it has a wonderful
channel Gotham ista ji o th am is ta has
a wonderful channel on skincare my girls
Stephanie Nicole she does a lot of
videos on skincare and they have a solid
real knowledge based on ingredients what
I know is from my one year ish of
researching ingredients for my channel
and most of my research comes from
googling stuff looking at reputable
sources places that don't actually sell
the cosmetics I do look at polish toys
occasionally even though they sell
things but I take their information with
a grain of salt I always make sure I
check other sources as well but I look
at a lot of different places I have a
couple of books that I have which of
course I don't have with me
but I have like some books that I look
at but I am not formally trained in any
of this this is just my knowledge from
what I've gained from that year of year
ish of research ingredients that being
said I I only know about the ingredients
that I've researched there are thousands
and thousands and thousands of
ingredients and I don't know them all so
all I can speak to is the ones that I
know but again this was requested so I'm
hoping I can give you enough information
to let you be able to kind of glance at
an ingredient label and be able to say
well this has some good stuff in it this
is a lot of fillers things like that so
I'm hoping I'll be able to help you
enough and I'm hoping I'm not completely
over my head with this video in that you
know I'm just gonna do my best with it
because it was requested and I'm really
hoping that I do a good enough job with
it because you know I only know what I
know and I'm gonna tell you everything I
know and I'm gonna let this be kind of a
community run QA kind of thing where I
figured what we would do is we would go
to some of your favorite products people
that are here in the live chat and we
would we would just kind of look at the
ingredient list together and I could
kind of tell you what I recognize that
looks good and what or whether it looks
bad so before I get into this I do want
to tell you what's in this eye cream to
show you where my kind of alarm bells
were with it kind of like are you
kidding me
and then I'll we'll talk about some good
ones so before I do that I do want to
say hello to the people that are here in
the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness I'm hoping there are some
skincare experts out there that would
kind of back me up on things or correct
me if I'm wrong stuff like that I'm
hoping I'm trying I'm going to try very
hard not to say anything I don't know I
don't give you any false information
I'll just say I don't know you might
hear that a lot
video because there is a lot that I
don't know but there's also a lot I know
as well
Becky is here good morning to you Mimi
is here good morning Steph one of our
fabulous chat moderators good morning
Steph this is a hashtag not sponsored
video speaking of stuff this video is
just something that I chose to do with
no particular brand attached Junie is
here good morning Banshee news good
morning reading
good morning Christina is here amber is
here Aspen is here good morning to you
Shirley and latina and Julio down by the
schoolyard are here tam is here another
fabulous moderator Michelle also what to
the makeup reporter and Facebook admin
hello hello
judith and the gold digger and nancy my
friend is here and Tabitha of course is
here my fabulous production manager
thank you so much mermaid and the marine
Denise Becky Tracy Karen Shirley thank
you so much for being here and if I
didn't say good morning to you good
morning to you I am really hoping that
this goes well can you tell them I'm a
little nervous about this one I'm like
sitting here thinking was this a good
idea or not
okay well we'll see so let me go ahead
and tell you about this this particular
eye cream that came in my Ipsy bag the
ingredients are water butylene glycol
cyclo penta siloxane and phenoxyethanol
those are the first four ingredients and
those are basically just like texture
ingredients there's there's nothing in
there that skincare based and you really
want to look mostly at the first 10
ingredients the first 10 ingredients are
gonna tell you what the product is
mostly made of anything beyond that
there may be some good things in there
that are impacting the formula but those
first 10 ingredients are really the
tell-all for it when you look at really
the first five those are gonna be the
ones that make up most of the substance
because if you don't know cosmetic
companies have to just like food you
have to list the order of ingredients
from the one from what is most
containing here down to the least until
you get to the one percent mark once you
get to the one percent mark then you can
list them in any order and they don't
tell you where the one percent mark is
so you kind of have to guess for example
there was a cleanser that I reviewed on
the channel for what the K it had over
100 ingredients in it it's a green tea
cleanser I think I did it last Monday
and there's over 100 ingredients in
there so will way I explained it in that
video is let's say you have a ten gallon
vat of this stuff and you take 1/8 of a
teaspoon of something and you put it
into that 10 gallon vet how much are you
going to actually get in your 5 ounce
bottle of product not a whole lot
probably not enough to impact the
formula enough unless it's super super
super potent for some reason and that's
not something I have a knowledge base on
so anything that's beyond like once I
see like the preservatives and things
like that like I'm all and the the
colorants if there's colorants anything
beyond that I'm like that's it probably
about 1% mark there sometimes I get I
would imagine the preservative might be
a little higher like for this the
phenoxyethanol is a little bit higher so
there might be more of a couple of these
after it but once we get past like the
does fit their sixth ingredient I'm not
really taking it seriously at this point
so that is that's kind of where I'm at
and like with this you know what I want
to see is those good solid skincare
ingredients that were gonna be talking
about in this video in contrast they do
want to talk about the Juice Beauty
smoothing eye concentrate which is what
I've been using recently I got this in a
fabfitfun box that was a sponsored video
this one is not I'm just telling you
that this is what I've been using so
it's like almost gone I'm trying to get
the rest out of this this was a sample
size and I did pull up the ingredients
for this this is gonna be mostly like a
hydrating skin like healing kind of kind
of product I didn't see a lot of
anti-aging in this but it's very
hydrating which is really good for
preventing you know in anti-aging it's
good for keeping your skin hydrated so
that you don't dehydrate and the more
you're dehydrated the more more likely
you may be to get wrinkles and all of
that and you're gonna lose your
plumpness and all of that so hydration
is good that's my point so we've got
white grape juice which I thought was
very interesting I don't know a lot
about white grape juice but the second
ingredient is aloe aloe juice it's
better to have aloe vera extract um then
aloe juice juice is not the best version
of aloe you want the extract if you can
get something like the leaf extract so
that's kind of okay for me the next is
sunflower seed oil which is another one
that's okay cetera cetera I think
alcohol that is a good alcohol the ones
you don't want or the are the is it
alcohol D I'm this is off the top of my
head alcohol denatured alcohol is the
one that you don't want
your skincare because that is one that's
going to dry out your skin especially if
it's higher up glycerin is one that
recently I've been talking about how
it's a humectant so it pulls moisture
from the air and pulls it into your skin
but if you live in a dry environment it
could take the the moisture from the
lower layers of your skin and pull it up
recently I've been doing a little more
research on glycerin and I've seen
there's an airplane going by don't know
if you can hear it but I recently have
seen some contrary studies of that
there's always contrary studies where
people are saying that that has been
debunked by some studies so take that
with a grain of salt with the closer in
and the it being a humectant and all of
that I'm kind of upset with myself that
I've been pushing that so hard in my
videos because I've recently found some
contradictory information that I didn't
find before but there is still some
strong evidence to suggest that that is
true but there's also some some studies
that have said that it's not as strong
of like there's some some contradictory
studies let's just leave it at that so
you may want to stay away from glycerin
if you live in a dry environment but
it's not a 100% thing so those are the
the first ingredients in it a lot of
hydrating healing kinds of things in
here and I've really really been
enjoying this so you can see the
difference between that and like
butylene glycol is a texture thing
cyclopentyl siloxane is a texture thing
phenoxyethanol is a preservative then
you have glycerin then you have
dimethicone cross polymer which is a
texture texture thing it's a silicone
then you have dimethicone which is
another silicon then phenyl try meth
acum which is another texture thing and
then we have soybean oil and it's like
which would you rather have which would
you rather you know what I mean so
supposedly this is a $35 eye cream and
then this one is $29 so it's kind of a
no-brainer for me which one I would pick
and that's that's really what I wanted
to share with you in this video is kind
of you know what to look out for this is
this is 0.5 ounces and then this one is
point oh okay so this is a full-size
this is 0.5 ounces this is a full-size
and this is 0.5 ounces but the
ingredients in this maybe aren't the
best best best ingredients ever but it's
definitely better than this so I'm going
to go ahead over
that was my example I'm gonna go ahead
over to the collective brain and I'm
gonna talk look and see what are some
things that you guys Pamela says that
methyl cone is a silicone that is very
true
let's see Shelby says I've tried
everything my skin is super dry and now
it's finally not what have you been
using Shelby let me let me let me go up
and see what Shelby's been using let's
see if she's told us why I sell all ours
D and number three in YSL all ours let's
look up what she's talking about here I
used to be able to be able to look to
show you like a screenshot of what's
happening oh it's a foundation okay well
we can look and see what the ingredients
are in this foundation let's see if they
list it and sometimes they don't list it
on their websites let's say okay waters
like um cyclohexyl siloxane denatured
alcohol see that's the third ingredient
is denatured alcohol so I'm really
really surprised that you're finding
this to be a hydrating thing the the
cyclohexyl siloxane is gonna make you
feel like it's very smooth on your skin
but the denatured alcohol is is an
ingredient that's supposed to dehydrate
your skin eyesight dodecane is an
ingredient that is like a it's like a
balancer almost it's in a lot of liquid
lipsticks to kind of help with the
drying so maybe they put that in there
to combat the denatured alcohol very
interesting I don't see I mean it's not
it doesn't claim to be a skincare and
good product but I don't see skincare in
here that's very interesting that you
find that this is good for your skin Wow
so interesting I mean because one of
those things is you know everybody's
skin is different so I don't know that's
pretty crazy though Wow Allison is here
good morning Allison Allison I've really
been enjoying your comments lately
thanks for coming by
Oh Shelby says no that's not what I was
saying I was answering someone's
question okay alright Shelby thank you
so much for clarifying because I would
it looked like you were saying that that
was helping you with your dry skin okay
well I'm not gonna go back and do that
again
Kahless says I use the first-day beauty
ultra Repair Cream and it takes away my
dry patches let's talk about that one
because that's one I have definitely
heard about so I'm gonna copy that from
your from your post kala and let's put
it in and let's talk about the
ingredients for that product okay ultra
Repair Cream intense hydration it's $30
for a six ounce tub and it looks like
we've got water stearic acid glycerin
there's a lot of things I don't know
capric the capper licking capric
triglyceride is a good one
Cerrito alcohol is fine let's see what
this is so this is this is the process I
do so there's something called but
beauty rose I don't know how to present
parky butter we're gonna we're gonna
look and see what that is because that's
pretty high up so I'm just googling that
that's all I'm doing I'm typing it into
a google search and it's shea butter so
this is a shea butter product
dimethicone Oh wailing that's a good one
and Allan toen is a good one so we've
got shea butter which of course is going
to give you a lot of hydration some
people are allergic to shea butter
though so that's definitely not
something that you want to be using if
you're allergic to it of course
squalene there's a lot of controversy
about squalene because people say it's
squ ala and II there's a lot of
controversy because some people believe
that all squalene is from shark liver
oil but that's not true
it can be actually brought from plants I
believe is one of the one of the ways to
get it but the thing about ingredients
is you don't know where your ingredients
are from but that is one that is really
really good for eczema really good for
eczema what else yeah that's just that's
just a really good one and it's and and
okay here we go so this is a website
called truth in aging calm which is a
really really good website for like
legit information they always cite their
sources of where they get their
information
and which studies which I absolutely
love so they say it's so bountiful while
it's not so bountiful in plants as it is
in shark liver can be found in many
vegetables it's also found in human
sebaceous secretions as a per curser of
cholesterol
I thought sometimes they go and it says
squalene levels peak in our early 20s
and then decline very rapidly so a lot
of time they get it from olive oil so
this really is a good one and then Alan
Cohen is another one that's really good
then we have green tea leaf extract
which I've done a couple of videos on
green tea let's talk about Alan Cohen a
little bit real quick and I'm just going
back to truth and aging because I really
do love that website it's so good it
says it's it has the ability to remove
excess skin it's a skin soothing
ingredient it helps you shed the outer
layer of your epidermis and promote
healthy tissue formation so it's in a
gentle exfoliant no evidence of
anti-aging effects according to truth
and aging so yes this is a good one
you're gonna feel immediate hydration
from that shea butter but you've also
got some good like the squalene and the
Alan toen for the exfoliation and for
the hydration so that's really really
good a definite yes on that one let's go
back to the community and see what the
community is saying Shelby says that
means I have no natural squalene lol
maybe not maybe not Erin says I wonder
what a vino eczema lotion has that makes
it so good for eczema in particular
let's look at it on the website that I
really like a lot it's called truth and
aging Melissa says Alan toen is an egg
white I think I'm not sure about that
that's definitely possible though let's
look at the Aveeno eczema lotion let's
see what's going on with that I'm hoping
you guys are finding this helpful I'm
hoping I have enough good information
for you I'm not usually as
self-conscious on camera as I am with
this one but I want to make sure I'm a
hundred percent honest with you guys
about what I know and what I don't know
and that way you know to take my
information
crane assault let's see it says
collodial oatmeal which I don't know
anything about water glycerin and then
something chloride I don't know this
ingredients I'm gonna look at it this
the sterile diammonium chloride let's
see what that is I have a feeling that's
a texture ingredient and I'm just
googling it that's all I'm doing
and then ewg org is another good website
to kind of start off with ewg is the
Environmental Working Group but the
thing about the ewg that you really need
to be aware of is that sometimes they
take studies and they kind of blow them
out of proportion where they'll have a
study where it was only done in rats in
the 1970s and if the rats were given you
know topical application of 50 percents
concentration over a period of three
weeks and they developed cancer you know
and it's like in a typical skincare
product maybe it's a point five percent
concentration and you know you it's like
and it's done in humans yeah there's a
big huge difference so you know truth
ewg might say that this is a horrible
and you know ingredient based on this
rat study of this huge concentration
that you would never see in a human
product so you just have to kind of take
it with a grain of salt and look further
so if AWG says something's bad i
definitely recommend you look at a
couple of other sources to kind of
verify that information but it is a
really great place to start for research
so this disodium back to the chloride
thing dye sterile dye sterile dye
sterols ammonium chloride it's used in
hair conditioners and skin creams
according to the Beauty Brains which is
an excellent podcast oh my gosh the
Beauty Brains amazing let's see the
positive charges in the ingredient react
with the nickel each negatively charged
proteins on the skin and don't
completely rinse off or become absorbs
this this leaves the skin coating that
leaves the skin feeling smooth so it is
a texture thing so it's supposed to give
your it's at like a topical thing
there's no skin care in that ingredient
it's just kind of a topical thing we've
got panthenol I know I've looked that up
before I don't
see a lot of good things in here I'm
quite disappointed actually so that was
the third ingredients we had water then
we had glycerin so good hydrating for
definitely good hydrating in moisture
environments maybe not as much in the
dry environments but there's conflicting
information there and then we have that
one that makes your skin feel good on
the outside
but it doesn't do anything actually good
for your actual skin and then the next
ingredient is the panthenol and then
that one let's see okay well almost
there it's a pro vitamin B it's using
cosmetics and beauty products primarily
as a lubricant emollient and moisturizer
because it binds to the hair and
penetrates the skin providing both
lubrication and hydration so that's a
pretty good one it's a vitamin B
derivative so that's pretty good
petrolatum which gets a really bad rep
because of the petrol in the beginning
it petrolatum from what I understand
please correct me if I'm wrong is that
it mostly gives like a topical feeling
kind of like the other one a topical
feeling of hydration but doesn't really
do great things for your actual skin so
so far I'm got cetyl alcohol oat kernel
oil I really don't see a lot of good
things in here we've got Sarah mine but
that's like way down at the bottom
there's only one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen fourteen ingredients in this so
like the first five would probably be
the biggest and that's the water the
glycerin though a topical thing we
talked about the panthenol the
petrolatum and isopropyl palmitate which
is another texture I believe so this one
doesn't look great which makes me kind
of sad because you said it works really
well for your eczema so maybe it's one
of those maybe it's a less expensive
alternative but I don't know if it's
actually going to do anything in the
long term at least according to me Oh
looking at the ingredients isopropyl
palmitate it's the same kind of thing as
that other one I was talking about about
the static from Beauty Brains is the
same kind of thing that is such a bummer
all right well let's go back to the
collective brain and see what people are
saying
yeah it is kind of interesting what's up
buddy yes that's fine
mama Beauty says Jen did you ever look
more into that ingredient in the Too
Faced Born This Way by my name is Monica
Oh Monica okay I think I can remember
that because it's Mon 420 okay which
ingredient was it in the bornus but oh
the one that was cancer-causing I didn't
look deeper because I kind of looked
really deep for that video let me look
and see what that was and it's it was
let me say Born This Way Foundation if
you didn't see my my video on the
comparing the new toothpaste foundation
to the Born This Way that's what she's
talking about where one of the
ingredients there's some research has
suggested its cancer-causing an
ingredient that is in Me Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation I'm trying to
remember which one it was at the hexohm
ah Methot cinemate and I'll tell you
where I got that info from but it's kind
of freaky and but the thing is is you
don't know the concentration that it's
in it you don't know the concentration
that was in the study so it's not one of
those where it's gonna immediately cause
cancer and you need to throw it away and
it's terrible and it's awful and all of
that it is fda-approved so you just have
to you know you have to decide where
your line is individually okay so this
is from truth and aging and it says it's
used in mostly in sunscreen products
it's used in products that are applied
to the skin to absorb reflect or scatter
UV rays it protects the skin from
sunburn and other damaging effects of
the Sun it also protects cosmetics and
personal care products from
deterioration caused by UV rays and
allows them to last longer and high UV
conditions but then with the safety
Mather measures it says according to ewg
in some studies and they've got links it
to produce excess reactive oxygen
species that can interfere with secular
signaling cause mutations and lead to
cell death so basically that's cancer
causing the reaction can also be
implicated in cardiovascular disease so
I don't know like how that all gets to
the heart and everything I don't know
that's why I just kind of mentioned it
but this is kind of the best information
I found on that and it says ingredients
applied to the skin may cause allergic
reactions
so if you had a bad reaction at the Born
This Way Foundation that might be why so
yeah I mean it's it's it's some studies
and when I click on the word studies it
takes me to a ResearchGate article and
it's very very let me see requests full
text okay so in order to read the full
text you have to be a student let me see
not a researcher and then you have to
log in which I haven't done yet it looks
like very very science II though it may
be a little too deep for me I mean we
need meet may need um got the me stuff
for this one but yeah I mean we
definitely don't want to over react
Laura says don't overreact people and I
totally agree we don't know the
concentration it was used in the studies
like I said it could have been in rats
in the 1970s at a 50% concentration for
three weeks straight I mean you don't
know but if it's one of those things
that I want to bring your attention to
in case for you want to do something
about it for your own personal choice
you know so that's why I wanted to bring
it up because there is research there
and then people can kind of do more
research on their own if they want let's
see what else we're talking about
Charlie says the two-phase comparison
the two-phase faint oceans how I found
this channel I've got that ingredient or
on a sticky note on my sunscreen now I
love having the peach perfect foundation
I'm loving it the peach perfect
foundation has wonderful ingredients and
I go into more of that in the video but
it really does I mean he knocked it out
of the park with the ingredients on that
um the new peach perfect foundation if
you can stand the smell because the
smell is quite strong Tamm says palm oil
is the devil yeah a lot of people like
people don't buy palm oil drive products
for environmental reasons because of the
palm oils being chopped down and the
environmental impact of that both with
the just nature wise you know as far as
the you know nature sorry live stream I
would have cut that part out you know
animals and things and how they're being
affected by the palm trees being cut
down it's such a huge rate and all of
that you know oh the CeraVe therapy is
definitely recommended
by dermatologists let's check it out and
let's see why ceramides is what sherry
says so let's check it out because it's
very important to know that I think some
people equate you know that they have to
get drunk elephant in order to get
really really good skin care and that is
just simply not true there are so many
really good skin care products that are
not $80 or $100 you know you don't need
to go lemare you don't you really really
don't a lot of times it's like you know
if you get a gold bracelet you know you
don't need to get like the gold isn't
better quality just because it's $3,000
you're going for the design of it you're
going for the packaging you're going for
the name on it it's not necessarily a
better quality product not to say that
they're bad quality but you can get just
as good quality product from much less
expensive if you're looking for the
right things and it really just comes
from just like I did just just
researching and looking into those
things and just taking some time to
learn about it and you'll be able to do
the exact same thing I did because I
didn't you know I like I said it and go
to school for this it's just you know
what I've done from from just
researching and looking things up and
reading books and things all right Sara
V moisturizing cream I have heard really
good things about this let's check out
the ingredients label info okay so we've
got purified water glycerin and then
we've got Sarah tip 20 and cereal cereal
alcohol that which is a good one capital
it capric triglyceride yes those are
good and then we've got something that I
don't know behind Ramon iam Methow
sulfate and Cerrito alcohol cetyl
alcohol those are all good ceramide
three ceramide six - ceramide one
hyaluronic acid those are all really
good so yes this is this has a lot of
really good things in it let me go and
check out this bad one that started with
the B let's see if I could find it there
we go bent Ramon iam Methow sulfate a
very mild yet effective ingredient known
for its detangling and hair thickening
properties
so it's mostly used in hair care
products which is kind of interesting
when using lotions and creams it gives a
soft powdery after touch to the skin so
that's basically it for that but I mean
it does look like it's got some really
good things in it let's look up ceramide
3 just for the fun of it and see what
they say and you see how I'm doing this
is this and this is not something that
you can't do you can totally do this
there's an article in truth an aging
called our ceramides of skin
breakthrough there's an article by the
NCBI which is NIH about ceramide 1 and
ceramide 3 the reason why I like truth
and aging especially for a video like
this is that it gives it kind of in a
nutshell really quick if I was gonna do
this for and actually like thorough
video I would read those longer articles
but you guys don't want to sit here and
watch me process all that because it
takes a little while dr. oz recently
gave his three tips on how to drop a
decade from your skin and made a very
curious recommendation photo ceramide
capsules plant dates
ceramides less controversial e he also
mentioned vitamin C serums okay so then
it talked about we do photo ceramides
really work it says I could find no
independent research on photo ceramide
capsules but that's different that's too
like ingest let's sing ceramides are a
natural components of the human skin
their different ceramide types and
ceramide three and six are commonly
found in the skin all four layers of the
epidermis contain ceramides and they
play an important role in creating a
barrier which reduces infection and
helps to retain the skins moisture so
you guys can go over to em read the
whole article I don't want to read the
entire article at truth and aging but
that would be a place to look for more
info on that but but but it comes down
to is the CeraVe does look like a really
good product it is 1169 and this would
be for moisturizing for normal to dry
skin which is what it's advertised for
there are parabens in here though so if
you don't like parabens then that's
something that you want to consider but
parabens
were if you like watch Stephanie Nicole
like she'll say the same thing that a
lot of the scare on parabens was based
on a study that was debunked so just you
know if you don't have an allergic
reaction to parabens you may want to
look more into the research about
parabens and whether you want to cut
them completely out of your your beauty
routine because there really isn't a lot
of solid information about parabens that
say that it's bad for the average person
but it is bad for people that are
allergic obviously okay let's go ahead
and look and see what the community is
saying a more first time getting here
actually watching this live oh I'm so
happy you're here Janelle says I work I
will check out German doctor de work for
me but for the price of the price is not
good gotcha one thing you definitely
want to check out and I do have on
entire Korean Beauty series is that the
Korean beauty is on the whole very
inexpensive and you can get high
concentrations of really good
ingredients for like a skin creamy to
get a really really good one for like 20
bucks which is still a little expensive
for some people but if you're looking
for really good skin care
I'm telling you Kay beauty is the way to
go I'm telling you I'm telling you it's
really good Shelby says I started with
the ordinary but I but needed more so
I'm on the niod line I've heard really
good things about the niod line I
personally didn't have a great
experience with the ordinary but it may
have been the way that I chose to use it
that had nothing to do with the actual
quality of the products but you know you
can only you do the best you can I use
them for it was it three months four
months something like that I think was
three months I used the products
religiously and that was the way I chose
to use them was just to completely kick
everything out of my skincare routine
and just use the ordinary I do have that
video but it didn't really see good
results what do you think of korsak's
and belief believe has some really good
ingredients I'm not familiar with court
costs cost rx not korsak's cost rx I
haven't tried anything from them Monica
says a lot of times people are pretty
confused when we talk and find their
expensive skincare isn't the correct
skin care for them and that makes a
difference too I mean just because it's
really expensive doesn't mean that it's
something that's matched to what your
needs are so it's really important to
not just grab something based on a
recommendation from a youtuber but
really look and see what does that
skincare do what are the claims on the
container and make sure that matches you
and I know that sounds like a dud Jen
but I feel like some people they go oh
my gosh so-and-so said that this was a
miracle for them this was amazing for
them I'm gonna go out and buy it and
then they find that it doesn't do the
same thing for them because they just
simply have a different issue
now Sara says what about Alba Botanica
specifically their Hawaiian oil-free
moisturizer because I got two of them
from Walmart for $3 and it seems to be
awesome well let's check this out
Alba botanical Hawaiian oil-free
moisturizer let's check it out cuz if
it's 2 for 3 bucks yes I'm all about
that let's see oil-free moisturizer okay
oh I've seen this brand before okay
let's see I just have to find one that
has ingredients so thrive market calm
there it is Oh they've got it for $11.45
and they send that saving 41% Hawaiian
oil-free moisturizer and you got a deal
ingredients okay so we've got water
glycerin sÃ¡tiro alcohol I think I was
saying that wrong the entire video octo
palmitate which is a texture thing cap
roll capper looking capric triglyceride
yup glyceryl stearate that's a texture
thing oh oh here we go aloe the aloe
leaf juice so again again the juice
isn't necessarily the best but it's alo
is good dimethicone which is a silicone
glycerol Lori I think that's a good one
let me look it up glycerol nori and then
we've got the green tea we've got papaya
fruit extract these are good stearic
acid I think is a good one if I remember
correctly I know that people are gonna
watch us on the replay and do a bunch of
research remember this is off the top of
my head so please take this stuff with a
grain of salt because what is this
Beauty Brains has an article about
we're just gonna research ingredients
together be careful what you believe
about ingredient lists the Beauty Brains
calm I love them they're amazing what is
happening here
you've been green washed I was thinking
about doing the whole video on green
washing oh it's just talking about
people are saying that it's natural
things are natural when they're not
that's not what I'm talking about that's
a whole another video okay I don't see
any articles that I could read super
quickly let me see what AWG says the
purpose of it is skin conditioning agent
a moldy aunt surfa can't emulsifying
agent okay I'm gonna have to do more
deep research into that I don't want to
sit here forever and do that but yeah it
looks like it's got some great
ingredients down further we've got the
Allen toning we've got hyaluronic acid
what you just found a good one for
really really cheap nice job yeah this
is a good one I mean it looks like it's
similar to the CeraVe as far as the
quality of it I mean nothing that's like
blowing my mind like oh my gosh but but
yeah definitely a good one that's great
I can't believe you got that for three
bucks two for three bucks are you
kidding me
oh no yeah two of them at Walmart for
three dollars nice job yes green washing
green washing is when when you get
somebody was asking what green washing
is it's when you when a skincare or a
makeup company says all natural or
organic and they claim that they're the
best because they're all natural or
organic and then the ingredients really
don't do anything when they're let me
get let me get a formal definition for
green washing so it green wash is to
make sure that I'm representing this
correctly okay a disinformation
disseminated by an organization so as to
present an environmentally responsible
public image so it they're they're
basically saying that we're awesome
because we're this but really we're not
we're environmentally friendly all of
that but you know it really isn't true
so they're because really I don't know
what the percentages are but in order to
say you're a natural product or you're
an organic product I don't think it has
to really be very natural or organic
like there's they're like the
regulations on those terms are super
super loose so never like just you know
you see something that's all natural
especially cosmetic product or organic
or something you can't take that as a
hundred percent this is going to be an
excellent product because there's I'd
have to do a whole video with research
on everything to make sure I'm speaking
100% accurately but yeah just be careful
of that but that's what greenwashing is
yes Stephanie coha Shelby so Stephanie a
coal say cat poop is natural - doesn't
mean it's good for my skin exactly and
like you know poison ivy or poison oak
totally natural but should you put it on
your skin now oh I saw someone say
something about the pixie glow tonic
let's look up the pixie glow tonic
because that's one that gets a lot of
hype okay so I can find the ingredients
on this because sometimes the
ingredients are listed and sometimes
they're not there we go okay so we've
got ah okay we've got water we've got a
low leaf juice glycolic acid yes give me
some of this billing glycol glycerin
sodium hydroxide
witch hazel some people really love
witch hazel some people really hate
witch hazel so that's really important
the horse chestnut seed extract these
are all really high up oh nice yeah
definitely hexlen glycol fructose
glucose sucrose urea that's an
ingredient that causes a lot of
controversy because of the word urine
that it can be derived from some kind of
urine I think colorless crystalline
compound mem is um oh it's in urine
that's what it is it's in your urine but
a lot of the skincare ingredients it's
not it's not from actual urine let me
make sure that I'm getting I'm
representing this correctly urea pee and
your cosmetics from the Cosma test
that's actually a pretty good blog
it's not it's not actual pee though from
what I understand a component of urine
it's usually synthetic versions or using
cosmetics beneficial water binding and
mild exfoliating properties for the skin
so again just the stress this is
definitely something you can totally do
for yourself it's that you can do the
same thing I do i because i mostly use
google and then a couple of a couple of
books
so surely says my mom swears by witch
hazel yeah so definitely good on the the
pixie glow tonic I actually have a brand
new bottle of it that I haven't opened
yet because I'm finishing up my review
of the well I'm finishing up my thoughts
on the best damn beauty by Nicole
guerreiro and that video hopefully will
be coming out in the next couple of
weeks and I've been using the Peter
Thomas Roth toner which burns the doodoo
out of my skin but I really like it
not burns but it like feels really like
it kind of makes my skin feel a little
when I first put it on so but yeah so I
don't want to switch over to the glow
tonic but after I'm done with that I'm
going to switch over to the glow tonic
Sandra says what's in the makeup eraser
the makeup eraser is a microfiber towel
that's all it is
Elise says urea is just a basic
chemically substrate like a felt like a
filler is it really see people that some
people know this stuff better than I do
I don't know I I didn't realize urea was
a filler because that's not what I'm
pondering let me look again let me look
again because I don't want to give you
guys wrong information let me say let me
see if I can find a another source see
the problem is with some of these is
that the sources are not fabulous all
the time sometimes I just get blogs so I
try to avoid talking about the ones that
are just from blogs because I don't
necessarily trust all the blogs urea is
a naturally occurring compound a normal
metabolic constituent of a little bit
River purple or world's yeah nothing
here is telling me that it's a filler
but I mean you could be right you
probably know more than I do
so I don't know it's definitely
something I'm gonna have to look more
into but Elise says it's just the filler
so definitely take what I'm saying with
a grain of salt Banshee Muse says I like
the pixie tonic better than the ordinary
and even on the ski SK I its ski right
SK iÃ­r SK to know how to pronounce nut
Elise says we use it a lot in
biochemistry lab okay well there you go
there you go Stacy says good morning I
made it good morning to you say Mimi
says it cosmetic is that good
ingredients in the products can't really
we talked a little bit about squalene a
few minutes ago for me I've seen all the
research I've done about squalene has
been really really good as far as you
know the products that I've seen with it
in it people seem to speak very highly
of them and we did talk about that just
a little while ago but so much it
controversy well maybe we should look
into the new it cosmetic skincare let's
look into it let's see what's going on
alright so we've got about 15 minutes
left I came on ten minutes late so we're
gonna say in extra ten minutes okay
let's look at this it cosmetics I just
picked one anti-aging armor super smart
Kent skin perfecting beauty fluid it's
$38 come on click on it baby come on
load it up load it up we don't have all
day here okay ingredients water
cyclopentyl siloxane so that's not okay
and then we've got something butyl
something I don't know butyl octal Sal
Sal estate I think oh my gosh I but you
bring these all the skincare experts are
gonna come and destroy me after this
video okay so there's a bunch of really
complicated articles that I would read
if I was going to be doing a full review
on this let's see there's a safety
assessment doesn't look like there's
really much on this
air conditioning agent skin conditioning
agent miscellaneous solvent and skin
conditioning so that's probably more of
a filler because I don't see a lot of
good stuff about that because usually
the ones that are like the like ones you
want to find there's a lot of
information on them okay this one is C
1215 ethyl benzoate it's a thickening
agent okay so so far nothing good we got
one two three four were four and then
butylene glycol I think that's a I can't
remember if that's a good one or not and
then we have silica syllabus actually a
good one it's different than silicon
there's a difference there's silicon
there's silicon and there's silica and
they're actually different
okay propylene glycol and dye cap
relates that slash and dike dike cap it
capreit skin conditioning agents I'd say
promotes healthy skin according to
research and they've got a link this is
truth in aging is using skincare and
beauty products as an ingredient and
moisturizers cleansing products
fragrance products and make a product
such as foundations and lipsticks but
there's nothing in here that says that
it's amazing glycerin yeah I mean we've
got caprica a capper lick and capric
triglyceride but that was in the really
inexpensive stuff too so like looking at
these off this one off the top they've I
mean it's got a lot of ingredients it
looks like most of the really good
ingredients are lower down but again
this is just at a glance in order to do
a full like ingredient Alice's I would
have to spend an hour on it
and that's the anti-aging armor so at
first glance I would not purchase this
because it doesn't look amazing and it's
$38 okay let's try the confidence in a
in a cream I wish I could show you my
screen so you could look at it while I'm
looking at it but they don't allow me to
do that anymore again we've got water
butylene glycol cyclopentyl ox and
glycerin the same butylene glycol dead
cap relates I cap rate at the hexyl Ison
8
I I know I said that wrong let's look up
that one yeah this looks like a bunch of
like filler stuff in the beginning it
looks like all of the good stuff the
allen toe and the ceramide the retinol
retinyl what else is in here
I mean all kinds of good stuff tea tree
oil and all that stuff is all way down
so off just glancing at these I probably
wouldn't get them let's look up the
ephah hexyl I so know nay no Nate what
you can see this it's is o and O n a n
o8 e e oh my gosh
that's too many vowels I can't even do
it I would need to like do what I used
to do with my kids when I taught phonics
and separate it up by doing like lines
and do each one it says very little
information is available regarding this
ingredient this is true that aging
beyond beyond using it as an emollient
ester thickening and stabilizing so this
does not look amazing to me just at a
glance this does not look amazing we've
got some shea butter in here ala leaf
extract Amy but this is the same stuff
we were seeing in this Sara V you know
and in the other one that was the $3.00
at Walmart is the same stuff with a
bunch of filler in the beginning there
might be some other things that I'm just
not familiar with that I'm not looking
up like I said but it's not looking
impressive on those two ingredients that
makes me a little sad because I do like
it cosmetics I've had some good
experiences with them but that's not
making me happy okay let's go ahead
Tammy says Jen I was going to say that
just break it up into syllables girl
okay let's do it
ice oh no name
no wait I said no nano wait Pamela says
bye-bye lines give me little bumps main
ingredient and Matt become blocks my
pores yeah a lot of people have trouble
with dimethicone that's why I always
make sure I mention it in my videos okay
Oh Charlotte so berry magic cream let's
check it out that's another one Sandra
let's do it I hope you guys are having
fun with this because I'm having fun I
love ingredients it's super fun okay
Netta patois okay let's go to Charlotte
Tilbury website ingredients once you
check it out I'm glad these places all
have ingredients okay so we've got water
and then something I've never heard of
before a home oh so late let's check it
out Worcester Oh stearate they say I'm
looking to say there's anything that I
recognize right away that looks good
okay we've got phenoxyethanol that looks
like it's about the tenth ingredient and
then after that we have shea butter so
I'm not gonna look at anything beyond
the shea butter so let's look at this
home Oh slate because that's really high
up what is that
there's a WebMD article let's look at
the WebMD article it's used in
sunscreens to protect the skin from
harmful effects of the Sun prevent
sunburn premature and premature aging
helps to decrease the risk of scud sun
cancer okay so yeah I don't see I'm
looking at precautions and stuff they're
basically just saying make sure you
really protect yourself from the Sun
that this might not protect you
completely it's not a sunscreen yeah
there's not really a whole lot on here
but it's it does it looks like it's just
basically used for sun protection that's
the second ingredient then we have
glyceryl stearate s e let's look up that
one again I'm just googling girlfriend
and boyfriend I'm just googling
okay okay polished choice again this is
one that I take with a grain of salt it
says it's widely used in that ingredient
that is itself emulsifying that's with
se stands for so that's kind of a filler
ingredient not a filler in green when I
say filler ingredient the fill
ingredients are important because they
give you the texture that you like or
they help you know two things to absorb
or they thicken it or they thin it out
or they help with sense I mean they're
not like it's not that the fillers are
bad they're just you know not going to
help you with anything in your skin as a
hexyl Salas Salas sigh late it's another
sunscreen ingredient so it looks like
this is a good good to help with sun
protection and then butylene glycol
glycerin butyl methyl iodide benzyl
methane okay let's look up that one okay
they're calling that avobenzone they're
saying it's the same thing it's another
sunscreen so we're loading up on the
sunscreens here with this product again
this is the the Charlotte's magic cream
which is supposed to be really amazing
okay let's look up this one octa cry
lean active ingredient in sunscreens
what is going on here then we have cetyl
alcohol so that's a good one and the C
12:15 Akal benzoate we talked about a
little while ago cyclo penta siloxane
dimethicone phenoxyethanol and then the
shea butter so it looks like a lot of
the good things again are lowered down
but I've heard such wonderful things
about this so I don't know I'm very
confused right now why this is coming up
as not being fabulous because this is a
$100 for 50 milliliter product and it
has five stars 4.8 stars and 127 reviews
but I don't see a lot of good things
in the front end so I'm actually quite
disappointed in what I'm seeing but it's
coming it's got the allen toe and the
aloe leaf juice but again these are
things we saw in those less expensive
products so this would be something
based solely on the ingredient list that
I would not purchase our Blackburn if
ocation says all the k' brands have
snail is it really good for the skin I
they do not all have snail but a lot of
them do have snail and I have heard
wonderful things Sandra says I use the
magic cream every day and my skin looks
amazing it was a present that is
fantastic and I'm not saying these
things don't work
please don't tell it don't don't make me
don't twist it to make me say that this
is saying these things don't work I'm
just looking at the ingredient list
solely I've never tried these products
but I would definitely if it were me I
would choose products that were less
expensive that had better ingredients on
the top end
that's me personally based on my
personal knowledge so and it's so
expensive oh my gosh Paul says I love
those glasses on you oh thank you so
much
jacqueline says oh dang that price tag
just gave me a heart attack I know right
Nilo print says how I read chemically
sunscreens are not healthy in the long
term than physical sunscreens and that's
something that I don't have a lot of
knowledge on Stephanie is definitely a
better source on that Elise says is that
like snail slime yes they from what I
understand the snail they kind of scrape
it off of the snail they don't kill the
snail in order to get the slime because
if they kill the snail then they don't
get the slime you know they just take
the secretions of the snail and
supposedly it's very very good
I have very rarely used products with
snail secretions in them Allison says
I'm starting to see more and more that
it's chemical sunscreens that are
responsible for skin issues leading to
abnormal cell growth leading to skin
cancer and it certainly has my attention
yeah I haven't done a lot of research on
that
Tamm says snail secretions freaked me
out yeah they used to freak me out a lot
I actually have a video that's now
private that
did I think maybe four years ago it was
a long time ago it was on a oh I can't
remember the name of the brand off the
top of my head it's a man's name is the
name of the brands but it had snail
secretions in it and it freaked me out
in the whole whole video was like stupid
I ended up private in it because my
whole thing was oh my gosh it has snails
in it gross I'm not using it and it was
just a stupid video but yeah I
definitely used to freak me out - Holly
says hi Jenn what are some products with
great ingredient list that you love and
think are worth the cost I'll tell you
right now the best damn Beauty stuff is
it has some solid ingredients I'm gonna
do at the end of the year a top ten for
what the Kay
there's some really good stuff from what
the Kay that I've reviewed that I really
like a lot that are good good good solid
ingredient products let me see if I can
you know what I'm not even going to
navigate over there because I've got my
microphone on and everything but I got
all my what the Kay products in a drawer
over there but I am gonna do a video on
that let's see
trying to think of there's anything else
like off the top of my head the polished
choice products which I did I always
want to tell you this I did do a sponsor
video for them a really long time ago
but I'm no longer sponsored by them but
I still really love their products I
definitely recommend checking out some
of their line you can call and actually
get a consultation with somebody and
they'll recommend products for you and
the products are not outrageously priced
they're kind of mid-range - a little
less expensive on the skincare line oh
no something happened with Christine
what happened to Christine they
electrocute the snail so they produce
more slime because it's a protectant for
the snail are you kidding me Christine
oh my gosh I have never heard that
before in my entire life that is not
cool that is not cool oh gosh I had no
idea I will definitely have to look into
that a little bit more oh my gosh
Danielle says polished choice products
never worked for me Danielle what I
would what I would recommend is to
definitely call them tell them what
you've used and tell them you know if
you're interested in trying it again
tell them what you've used tell them
that it didn't
and maybe they can recommend different
products for you because the thing is I
think that a lot of people like okay
when I buy a two-faced eyeshadow palette
I pretty much know what I'm gonna get
okay I know what I know what it's gonna
feel like I know what it's gonna be you
know but the thing about skincare is
every product has its own ingredient
deck and especially with a brand like
polished choice their ingredient decks
on each product are all quite different
so you can't say polished choice on the
whole will never work for me you may
have just had the wrong ingredients for
your skin Monica I will look into it but
yeah so you definitely want don't want
to throw out the baby with the bathwater
if you know what I mean and and look and
see the products that you've used I
would definitely recommend talking to
them about it and see if there's
something else that is in their line
that has a different ingredient deck
that's for the purposes that you want or
maybe maybe you just want to try a
different line I don't know but I think
skincare is one of those things where
you can't just take the entire line and
say the entire line doesn't work unless
you've tried the entire line you know
what I mean just because the ingredient
extras are different Paul says I love
Paula she used to go on Oprah back in
the day I did not know that Shauna says
I use timeless skincare which you can
buy squalene and others that are
responsible and you know what you're
getting squealing turned my daughter's
eczema very nice that's great to know
thank you so much for that Kimberly says
leaders in solution aqua wringer and
metohia land and Ono Maddie heel I lost
it and MFR great sheet mask great to
know thank you so much for that
Christina says give polished choice time
to work the first time it didn't I it
didn't chew it gave up on it right away
yeah you definitely because your skin
isn't an instant thing it takes a while
for the for your skin to exfoliate and
regenerate and all of that it's not
something that's instant and that's one
thing that I feel like that Korean
skincare and their mentality on skincare
has over American skincare I don't know
about other countries but you know in
America we're all about fixing things
like this fixing things immediately we
want to fill in those pores we want to
you know minimize those fine lines and
we want to see immediate wares
and with Korean skincare what they do is
they're all about preventative so it's
about the long term it's about doing
things to help to retain the moisture to
help to retain the elasticity and that's
what their ingredients focus on so when
we try something and in America and we
don't get results within a month you
know sometimes we're like we'll forget
it it doesn't work so just know that it
takes a while for your skins to to feel
the effects of a skincare and some
skincare ingredients they take a full
year to do anything and I know that's
frustrating
but it's like that's just the way that
our bodies work and we can't force our
bodies to do things that they don't do
you know what I mean so that's why when
I do reviews I do three to four month
trials and that's what I'm doing with
best damn Beauty right now and that way
I at least have a good idea of what it's
doing to my skin even though a full year
would be better I don't want to just do
one skincare video a year I want to put
out more than that for you and give you
kind of an idea so I'm trying to do like
three to four skincare videos a year for
you but you do need to give it time to
work you definitely do so you know keep
that in mind and when you when you tuck
if you do decide to call Paula's Choice
I know I'm saying I'm not all polished
choice right now but I really like them
you know they do i do want to disclose i
have to disclose they have been sending
me a few products with no obligation to
review recently i haven't tried any of
them because i'm doing the best aunt
beauty stuff but they do occasionally
send me PR products as well but again
i'm just telling you you know my
experience with them has been very
positive on the end of the consultation
process so they can tell you how how
long it'll take for things to kick in to
they can give you a better idea and you
can also Google Google's fabulous
Stacey's wants me to look into the
medics 5.5 okay let's look into that I
don't know anything about that product
let's look Allison says SkinCeuticals is
great but way too expensive i mean i
feel like i've tried some skin suitable
stuff before i don't i don't have a good
memory on that okay so I see medics 5.5
collagen and cream with can't with
caviar on
Amazon okay so look let me see let's go
to the medics website and see what
happens there okay which red X 500 okay
so it's a whole line of products called
medics 5.5 what are we gonna be looking
for let's do the okay so it looks like
they've got products ranging from like
$20 to $40 let's see something that
weekend okay let's try this medics argan
oil plus 24 karat gold age rewind cream
it's $30 there's no ingredient list that
makes me unhappy
by the way there's no scientific
evidence that I've been able to find
that gold does anything for your skin
other than give you stress because you
realized that it did absolutely nothing
for you and you you bought into the fact
that gold is good for your skin because
you like gold and it's pretty gold
doesn't do anything just so you know
from what I've what I've seen and the
research I've done gold does nothing so
don't let that one sell you it does say
that has coffee bean extracts I've heard
some good things about coffee bean but
lotus extract I've heard good things
aloe vera is good but it depends on the
kind item and see but there's no
ingredient list so they could be talking
about all of these things the Lotus
extract the aloe vera the coffee bean
all of that and it could be the very
last ingredients so unfortunately that
website is not going to be helpful for
me let's see if I can find let's look on
Amazon and see if they have ingredients
on Amazon okay
why don't they have ingredients oh here
we go okay so this one right here this
is the retinol cream with freulich acid
anti-sagging treatment targets crepey
wrinkles and sun damage skin and it is
$12.90 on Amazon there's 110 customer
reviews and it looks like it's got four
stars so let's look at the ingredients
for this it says water cetyl alcohol
which is good glycerine dimethicone so
and then shea butter if you have acne
prone skin you stay far away from this
because it's got dimethicone and shea
butter on your face shea butter on your
face if you have dry skin you may enjoy
that but acne prone skin is probably not
gonna like that so much so tarath 20 i
think that's a good one let me look that
one up and then the next one is the aloe
leaf juice and then retinol so this is
gonna be a night thing retinol is a
night for Willick acid is good camilla
leaf oh that's the green tea extract
which i really like
let's look at this atera 220 okay
it's derived from coconut lime no I've
talked about this before it's a solvent
ionic stabilizer emollient so that's not
um oh here we go
yeah okay yeah so that's more of like a
you know helps with the texture and
stuff like that so yeah this someone
does look pretty good except for if you
have if you don't like the idea of
dimethicone on your skin or shea butter
on your face then you definitely want to
stay away from this but if you have
drier skin this may be a good one so
this one is gonna be based on who you
are it has apple fruit extract and i've
done some research on apple fruit
extract that actually looks pretty good
but there's not really a lot of
scientific research it's more people
like trying it out and saying that it's
good and companies that sell it saying
that it's good so yeah some good stuff
in here i think that that one looks like
it'd be worth the 1292 try out if you're
interested that one looks pretty good
alright let's see okay we've got oh it's
what it's we're five minutes over how
did that even have
Ben Howard five minutes over man I was
having fun too
bummer last one Susan says I'm late
joining but what if ending this ginger
good for Fort work in ginger I don't
think I've never seen ginger in skincare
will do ginger in cosmetics and see if
anything pops up and that's humming all
I do honestly beauty benefits of ginger
ginger extract okay hmm
there's some lotions and things let me
see if it has any other names to kind of
keep an eye out for but I've personally
never seen it and in skincare ever
there's some blogs that talk about it
but I don't know it's a toning and
antioxidant properties genders can
reduce the appearance of
hyperpigmentation draw into the areas of
the skin they were lacking color and let
the juice dry this is a blog though this
is not a blog but this is a website
called birdie so definitely you know
take this with a grain of salt
both ingesting ginger and applying it
topically have major anti-aging benefits
but there's no studies linked but it
says it's got anti-aging property but
honestly I have never seen it in a
skincare product
so let's look up science scientific name
for ginger and let's see zinger burro
fish canal so if you ever seizing a bear
of fish Annelle you're gonna want to
stay away from it because you're
allergic to it all right I have to go
and spend some time with my kiddos
because it is our family day and I want
to thank you so much for being here I
hope that you found it helpful and what
I would really really love is if you are
a skin care expert if you are a
dermatologist if you are an aesthetician
if you know about the ingredients that
I've talked about if I have made any
mistakes if you want to add anything to
it if you feel like something wasn't
represented perfectly please please
please leave comments down below and I
and please read those too because again
I am not trained in any of this I am an
ex
Googler and I have excellent at reading
books but I this is not something that
I'm formally trained in so hopefully
this has given you an idea of how to
look up ingredients how to find
information on your own and also some
ingredients to look for and how to read
a label and while you're in the store
and kind of be like no no about this or
yes I definitely want to try this but a
big message I want to make sure I get
across to you is that you don't have to
spend a hundred and fifty two hundred
dollars three hundred dollars on
skincare in order to get something
that's really really good
so I hope you have a wonderful rest of
your day
where or night wherever you are and mad
mad love to you and I will see you in a
video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
