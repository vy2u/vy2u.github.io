broadcast from generation beauty I am
excited to be here I know I got the link
up late so I'm hoping that people will
join me soon so I don't want to talk too
much until there are more people here I
know that you guys watching this on the
replay are excited to hear more about I
always forget to turn off the sound on
the live chat here let's skip the ad hi
Liz good morning in Oregon good to see
you I got a movie a little bit closer so
I can read today but yeah so we are at
generation beauty we're about to go to
the very last day of generation beauty
today we're going to be leaving here
about ten thirty to go get breakfast
good morning Alaska good morning to
Leanne good morning to Nikki some of you
guys will probably this will be kind of
repeat information because if you follow
me on periscope I you guys already saw a
lot of the stuff and heard a lot of this
information good morning Sean tall very
good to see you and Mickey yes I did get
the mega Pro too thanks to you I got
Lily to get it to Lily Spurgeon like my
friend friend she got it too good
morning shannon oh it's so good to see
you guys it's wonderful to see you so
generation beauty so far generation
beauty what can i say about it um well i
can tell you that it has been wonderful
meeting people that has been a fantastic
thing i have been loving hugging people
and that has been the best part is
meeting people the event itself I do
appreciate how much effort was put into
it let's say that I appreciate that
there are lots of brands that I am
interested in that are there me to Nikki
did you get that did you get it too good
morning fizzy pop there are lots of very
good brands there to check out and talk
to I've talked to a lot of brand about
what's it been make up and drop a lot of
business cards so that has been good but
the event itself and the way that it's
set up is not my favorite
yes yes well this should not cut out
shantal this should be good Sean Tom
wants to know was talking about on the
phone periscope cuts her out if you're
watching this on replay you can't see
the chat window that's going over on the
side so I'm going to try to repeat what
they're saying so that you can know what
is happening but yeah so the format of
it is not my favorite and I'm really
hoping that somebody from Ipsy does end
up watching this just because I feel
like I've got some good feedback um you
know I mean it's the whole thing is you
go in and you get this like pass thing
babe can you pass me one like one of the
things with the tickets on it so I can
show them the ticket thing you go in and
you get this thing with little tickets
on it and you wait in these ridiculously
long lines with your little ticket and
then they give you something or they
provide some kind of service while
you're there so so this is I had lost
mine and they were nice enough to give
me another one which was super nice of
them but this is a little paper and then
what you do oh ok it sorry officers
going to comment so what you do is you
tear off these little tear tabs and and
then they give you something at the
booth and that way you can only make
sure you only get one of their things so
some of the booths were not having any
more of their goody bags like their bags
that they were giving out of stuff which
i think is kind of strange just because
I feel like generation beauty
communicates how many people are coming
so you would think that they would pack
that many bags maybe they didn't wanna
invest that much money and I don't know
but by the time I convinced myself to
wait in line for an hour for something
they were sold out of the bags so like
it was like what the lines were just
they're ridiculous they're really long
and you don't know what you're going to
get you don't only know what you're
waiting in line for you can walk up to
people that work there and ask them what
you're waiting in line for but it's kind
of a big cluster you know like it's just
you know it's a lot of waiting in lines
and I am NOT a waiting in line person I
wanna see a gen Birchbox club I want you
to I would
off to collaborate birchbox I did do a
collaboration with bartsch box in a
video that they sent me some stuff from
the Birchbox shop and I reviewed it but
I would love to work more closely with
Birchbox I love birchbox I love hip c2 I
do I love epsy but I'm not a big fan of
this event overall just because I feel
like you know though it's organized it's
not fun you know it's not fun to wait in
line for a really long time and that's
all you're doing is waiting in line for
a really long time and that's like what
you do and to me that's not enjoyable
Casey said this is the first time that
she's ever made early of this Sunday oh
I'm so glad you're here Casey only one
more day to go yeah and yeah and and
John and I were playing on getting there
kind of late because we don't want to
spend 11 23 there will probably be there
one two three today just because we
don't want to want to be there the whole
time and if that means we miss out on
goodie bags miss out on goodie bags I
got a lot of stuff already thanks to
ypsi the goody bag situation is the swag
bags are amazing like that's another
huge positive like they really hook you
up with the swag bags even like I went
to the Creator event and I I mean roll
this up because I don't want to miss any
comments um I went to the Creator event
on Friday night and we got a giant bag
of stuff like a giant bag and then
everybody that goes to generation beauty
gets a bag of stuff and both bags were
very generous and wonderful like
especially the bad guy got as a creator
was ridiculous like absolute particulars
there's hundreds of dollars of stuff in
there and then the one we got as just a
guest at generation beauty that
everybody got down one had over 200
hours where the stuff they said so yeah
so you know and we got another one today
another bag of stuff today Shannon says
if you want to see several brands you
would never have enough time to see them
all because of the lines exactly and
what I ended up doing was I ended up
kind of going to the front of the line
and talking to people and saying hey is
your social manager person here like and
they would point me over to the person
that I wanted to talk to
and then I would just talk to that
person then I would walk away and I just
wouldn't get the little sample thing
that they were giving out and kind of
passed on those which makes me sad
because I was hoping to do some kind of
give away with a lot of the stuff but
it's just the lines are just too long
Jenny teen wants to know if the party
was fun well seeing people that I know
was really fun it was nice meeting some
new people I got to meet Nicole from
young wild &amp;amp; polish that I'd never met
before which was very nice it was nice
to meet her I got to see Manny anyway
but that's the second time that I have
met him I also got to see patrick Star
that's the second time that I have met
him and other than that there were no
new peak well no that's not true as far
as like people like to have bigger
channels those are the only people that
I am I met oh and then julieg I may have
a complete idiot dad for myself in front
of Julie gee that's a whole other story
that I'm not even gonna get into I'm not
going to rehash what I said it'd eulogy
but it was stupid anyway no but I met a
lot of people with channels that are
about my size a little bigger a little
smaller some really really nice people
wrote down a lot of channel names
subscribe to a lot of channels got some
people subscribed to my channel hoping
network with some of those people
there's one and the girl that has a
really good channel that I want to shout
out she was just standing on the side
with her friend and she is so so so cute
let me find her because I have a note
with Oh makeup by mlc not makeup mlc but
makeup by mlc hung out with her but she
was super nice and then um her name is
destiny Noel on Instagram and her name
on YouTube is spelled destiny des TI NY
but then there's four wise yyyy at the
end of her name and then an X and then a
three I know that's really annoying as
far as me like having to spell it out
loud maybe I'll try to put it in the
description down below she is the cutest
little channel she's um got like 75
thousand subscribers and she's just
adorable she's one of those younger girl
youtubers and she's just very cute so
those two I definitely wanted to shout
out his new channels that I found thanks
to the Friday event but there's always a
big but it was so loud in there that you
could not talk to anybody and was
supposed to be kind of a networking
thing but you couldn't talk to anybody
because it was so loud like you
literally had to scream in people's ears
and like I went to the next party last
when we went to imax and there was a lot
of food there and i went thinking that
was going to be more food there and it
was just like two guys walking around
with a couple of trays at the very
beginning with like appetizers i didn't
know what they were like it was like not
food enough that i was i was expecting i
was expecting to kind of have a couple
of little appetizers and things and i
ended up eating anything because the
guys were just kind of walking by
quickly and then they were gone and they
never came back and was like oh so they
did have henna which was really cool a
lot of people got hannah done and it
looked beautiful there were some photo
booths opportunities where they had
little props and things but other than
that it was just very loud dancing with
a bunch of people that I knew and didn't
know about to see some people that I did
know again I got to see it's britt lynn
again she's very very nice Vanessa from
bad as rad I got to give her giant hugs
mini me she I got to hang out with her I
got to hang out with who else with Nikki
Murphy I got to see Ellie from elko she
didn't stay very long but I got CLE from
elko you know it was really nice hugging
people but I wish it wasn't so loud or I
wish there was a place that we could
gone it wasn't so bad where we can
actually have a conversation because I
feel like I kind of defeated the purpose
of the above the party if we couldn't
even talk to each other you know and I
felt bad for people that were there by
themselves because you weren't allowed
to have a plus one yet they made it
impossible for you to talk to people and
meet people i don't know i just thought
that was kind of crazy so if people from
epsy happened to watch this my
suggestion to you is either lettuce
spring plus ones or give us a place that
we can talk to meet people because it
was just it was counterproductive you
know I mean and it was it was way too
loud I mean it was like club loud you
know it wasn't like meet and greet
mingle loud you know I don't know it
would be nice it was more of a cocktail
party rather than a club that makes
sense oh and there was an open bar which
was also very nice for people that chose
to partake in drinks which was nice so
anyway enough about that let me go ahead
and scroll down and see some of these
comments because I'm missing a lot
comments as I'm talking kind of I kind
of stopped the comments so I could focus
on what i was saying so let me go down
let's see okay Amanda they should have
had we're talking now on they're going
back probably talking about the
generation beauty and what I was saying
about it she says they should have had
the samples prepackaged because just of
Hammond mount exactly and John and I
were saying that like places like tart
that we're selling things I do it like
chick-fil-a style where you've got
somebody walking down the line and
writing down tickets for everybody of
what you want and then they could have
somebody on fulfillment back there where
they're like you know getting like maybe
like carbon copy tickets where you give
somebody you know you write down the
person's name what they want you take
the copy and you take copies back to the
counter and you have somebody getting
the products together so that when you
go up there you're ready to pay you know
the person who's on fulfillment can like
you have somebody getting the products
you can have somebody calculating the
total so the line moves I mean the tort
line was probably we estimated about an
hour and a half to wait in and I'm sorry
but I don't even wait like for parking
like I would rather park a mile away
then wait for a parking space I'm not I
it's not worth it to me to wait an hour
and a half to save ten dollars on a
blush it's just I just can't I can't do
it you know so anyway and I felt bad why
Miami going to that cuz I handled that
privately excuse me I do have a cold I
thought it was from the from screaming
at the party but I actually have a chest
cold I don't know what's going on but
yes Amanda I totally agree with you and
then Chrissa is talking about oldest
stuff three times the points I think
Kristen Nikki you're talking about also
points you might want to check out all
two points um you guys are limit okay
let's see she'll says good morning good
morning to you Chantel says gemco swag
bags you're set for life I know right I
should show you guys some of those hello
to Tabitha very good to see you thank
for all you did to help me this week I
appreciate you so much shantal said
life's too short to stand in long lungs
I know like I don't even wait like I
don't go on rides but if I did I still
wouldn't wait in long lines corn rice
courses is Jen hi hon I said she must
run
in your app I posted the new hard candy
stuff cool you know what I did get it
and you know I didn't pass it along I
forgot to pass it along for the show
today and I'm so sorry Christy I dropped
the ball on that so what I need to do is
I need to talk to you privately about
how to get me information because we
have a brand new system so Krista I'm
going to have to we'll have to get in
touch again because I got to get you in
touch with Tabitha and work out how you
can contribute to the show in a more
functional way so we can like link your
blog and all that stuff because I want
you involved in things because you're so
good Leanne you are like an energizer
bunny i love it i would have dropped by
after friday night yesterday yeah yeah
I'm trying man trying to hang in there
Jenny um it's easy to chew on your foot
on your way it's easy to chew on your
foot when your feet are killing you well
my feet were my was having issues
because I had really high heels and I'm
wear high heels Shannon said that I CLA
yes I did I met her at me at the Friday
event but I did not see her generation
beauty yesterday shantal says I'm like
subscribed young law and polish but now
she seems kind of snobby I don't know
maybe she's not I you know it was so
loud in there it was really hard to talk
and then I did not she had a meet and
greet at OMSI where but it did not wait
in line to take a picture with her I
don't take like I'm not of big take
pictures with people think like even
when I've met celebrities in the past I
don't take pictures with them like I
just I feel weird like I feel really
really weird taking pictures with like
even Hollywood celebrities like getting
autographs and stuff like I don't do
that so like I didn't want to wait in
line in and take a picture with Nicole
just because that's just not my thing
that I do so I toured for me to say what
her personality's like because it was so
loud and I couldn't talk to her so I
don't know I don't know I can tell you
that we didn't get to have a good
conversation that's all I can say
Kristin finally makes the live show so
glad you're here Kristen scrolling down
scrolling down if anybody's saying that
I'm neglecting their comment please just
let them know that I'm working my way
down KJ was yet the loud music was
insane in the party like it was
absolutely insane and they did not allow
plus ones in the party so John could not
come
it was really loud it was really loud
fizzy pop would you say it's not worth
going if your not a youtuber I live kind
of clothes and thought about going glad
it didn't well it depends I mean I think
that if you don't mind long lines to get
samples you know and and sometimes full
sizes of things then if you're willing
to wait for things you probably don't
have a great time and it's also nice to
meet people you know what's up John
doesn't think that you're gonna have a
great time yeah John said it's not fun I
don't know if you can hear him over
there but he says it's not fun and for
people that if you don't but if you
don't care about standing in lines yeah
if you want to stand in line all day to
get discounts and free products then you
will enjoy it also if you like meeting
people from YouTube you will enjoy it
the line to me Manny and Patrick was
insane like that was like over an hour
to meet in any and Patrick hour probably
two hours to meet them Nicole from young
wanna polish was probably about 30 45
minutes to meet her probably about 45
minutes and then you gotta share tote
bag but but yeah I mean it's just if you
don't mind waiting in lines but
personally I do not feel like I will
attend generation beauty again just
because it's not my style to wait in
line for things like OB I'm just going
to end up like we'll probably just end
up sitting most of the time when we do
go um so yeah Krista says Jen and
everyone I'm so disappointed in this
year's palaces sephora tart 1 equals
awful and the to face one looks like
Sephora is just the glitter no shadow
awful Smashbox money was awful to all
Krista I'm so sorry that you did not
like it oh I didn't I haven't tried all
of those good morning to you Steph Steph
is my friend hi staff um let's see I'm
trying to scroll down to find some
things that are on-topic they sell hello
from the Philippines hello to the
Philippines I'm so happy that you're
here I know I don't look very happy like
I'm like because i'm super tired but i
am not in my heart I'm smiling very big
dance good morning Jen and everyone else
good morning to you Deepa good morning
to you and good evening to you Deepa
let's see uh KJ says you're so organized
you need to be consultant for the shows
yes yes my monthly obsessions calm is
krista's she's that's her blog so if you
want to check out a really good blog my
monthly obsessions com go check out
Christa steph says I meet you need the
kat von d i I the kat von d I still love
it the UM what you call it may be to
local it's fabulous it's absolutely
fabulous yes I yes I realized it was a
chest cold last night I did not realize
it to have until last night when I was
coughing and realized it had nothing to
do with me losing my voice at that party
he's called that konkret maybe maybe
that's it maybe it's from being a
convention i don't know i'm not sure
amanda wants to know if the events or
invite only the friday night party was
invite only but the generation beauty
you bought tickets so john and i
purchased tickets when we in april when
we got back from I mats or right when
we're going to i'm at somewhere in April
we bought tickets for generation beauty
they were fifty dollars each back then
and then they slowly go up in price as
it gets closer i think that the final
price was like two hundred dollars or
something for the final I forget exactly
how much they were at the final price
you could probably google it and find
out but yeah um they ended up getting
very very pricey I do feel like if
you're I feel like it was maybe worth
fifty bucks maybe for a one-time thing
you like when you go to the movies you
like I'm glad I saw that movie once but
I probably won't watch it again like
that's the way I feel about generation
beauty right now and I'm not hating on
FC I'm not I love ypsi I'm just giving
my honest feedback about it you know I'm
not going to lie about it oh yeah
absolutely if they had a way to like
maybe like a meet-and-greet corner where
you could just like sit and chill and
talk to people looking in an organized
way you know and trade channels may be a
place where you have laptop setup and
you could show people you have your
YouTube channel up so people could walk
around and just click on youtube videos
to watch
um you know if people that were going to
be there like they knew a lot of us were
going to be there because we were there
on Friday night so maybe like having
computers up with like suggested
channels to watch with like little
summaries that we sent in you know as a
way for people to find new channels or
something I don't know just like a
little bit more of a fun fun stuff to do
there was a magician at one booth who
was kind of funny but I only caught him
for about three minutes and then he was
gone so he was working for the company
the company brought him in so what
exactly is generation beauty it is an
event set up by epsy to network it's
guess it's supposed to be the network
with brands talk to brands learn more
about brands and to meet you two people
it's kind of like an eye mask but
without as much selling of products more
of promoting of products so you get more
free rather than paying for things like
I'm at you go any purchase items you
could have to buy where generation
beauty is more of this company wants to
tell you all about their things and then
they give you free stuff so you can try
it um let's see so for AJ Nikki sister
for jcpenney has a bunch of new sets
awesome let me know about those okay
deepa says why are you sounding like
this are you sick I'm sorry I just
joined chat yes I just well I was up
very late last night as I typically am
but it's not because of my awesome
production team might was because of my
awesome production team that I did not
have to stay up late on Friday night
okay but last night it was just because
I was gone all day and didn't have time
to work on the script until after we got
home from dinner which I didn't start
one anything really until well until I'm
sorry not the script on editing I think
it's start editing until about nine
o'clock which is very very late for me
to start editing but they I would've
been up even later if I didn't have my
awesome production team actually got
about four hours sleep last night but I
wouldn't have gotten any sleep it hadn't
been for them let's see everybody's
laughing at you John from earlier no one
wants to stand in line I don't think I
really don't think anyone wants to stand
in line sha Allah says John such a
trooper awesome he's so supportive you
think you yeah he left at one point he's
like I I'm gonna go get you know he had
a headache and you know smelled of
in there and he just feels like I gotta
get out of here so he left for about 45
minutes or so and came back another
thing was to is in order to get food and
drinks you had to go outside the venue
which isn't that big of a deal but it
would be nice if there was food inside
the venue i'm assuming it's a different
price point if you sell food in the
venue yes okay thank you Tabitha for
talking to her I appreciate that hi Anna
Canio or Annie how whatever you want to
call me hello good to see you steph says
again which youtubers were kicked out of
I'm out that was Nicole Guerrero that
was Manny mua and that was patrick Star
I think those were the only three there
may have been more but those were the
three because there wasn't an organized
way to meet them like a generation
Beauty it was extremely organized there
was a line set up in a specific part of
the venue they could handle a very long
line there also was a lot more there's a
lot more space at generation beauty than
there is a time adds so there's a lot
more room for people to wait in long
lines another thing that they do a
generation beauty which i think is very
interesting is they kind of wiggle the
lines around snake-like but once they
hit the end of the snake they call off
the line and they say line is closed and
they don't allow anyone else to line up
until the line dies down a bit which is
kind of frustrating when you walk all
the way to a certain point to go to a
specific booth and then the line is
closed so then you just find yourself
kind of wandering around an area until
they reopen the line it's just I don't
know it just I understand the logic
behind it it makes sense because you're
trying to keep the traffic down and
trying to keep things flowing but it was
just I don't know I don't know I get it
I totally get it but it just wasn't it's
not my favorite I don't have a solution
for that problem though I have no
solution but I wasn't a big fan of that
um an economist says she's rewatching
the smackdown got carried away oh yeah
John and I put up the birchbox Smackdown
and I would come was it last week this
past week and it's really funny if you
haven't watched that you should watch it
okay I've only heard about it from jen
and i'm irish so wouldn't know if
anything similar okay Oh for generation
beauty yes okay oops I skipped all the
way down hold on a minute I got to find
where I was and
then i need to i want to show you the
swag bag so what I'll do is I'll chat
for about five more minutes and then I'm
going to stop and i want to show you
what's in my swag bag um okay so
Christmas is Jen do you think I matches
a lot better yes I do because I feel
like I matts is more functional for what
I personally want in an event which is
to buy products and two to go up to
brands and see what they're all about
and swatch things I think generation Kia
beauty could be a lot better if there
was just more to do that wasn't annoying
like in order to do the fun stuff you
have to wait in long lines and it's just
I wish there was more stuff that was fun
to do that you didn't have to wait in
line score and I don't know necessarily
what that would be like I don't know I
don't know man there's just so many
people there like I don't know I don't
know but they've got a lot of people oh
and I met a lot of people from the team
of ypsi and they were super super nice
everybody meant at work for epsy was
awesome i was waiting in line next to UM
one of their social media people when I
was getting my coat on friday after at
the end of the party and we talked for
about 15 minutes and she was so nice and
I wish I could remember her name but she
was super cool super cool she did let me
know I'm not going to tell you exactly
what it is I promised her I wouldn't but
if you have FC points and you they're
coming out with some some really good FC
point things soon that she told me about
but I promised I wouldn't say anything
so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna break my
promise but there's some really good FC
point things coming out soon steph says
just do it want to experience it and
that's it that's kind of the way I feel
about it yeah $200 i think is what the
end price was if you got it at the last
minute before the tickets sold out
amanda says she appreciates my honesty
it's no problem I mean I definitely you
guys know I'm gonna be honest with you I
mean even if if she isn't upset with me
like I would feel really really bad if
she was upset with me but I feel like
it's important that I tell both you and
if see what my experience was so that
you guys know what it is so you know
what to expect if you go to one and so
that if see may get some idea of what
maybe they could do differently next
year steph says
I think you're blocking my light thanks
baby oh okay okay yes I'm good thank you
so much for checking in on me I
appreciate you um if they had like more
networking opportunities exactly or just
you know reasons to talk hi Alicia
Alicia not quite sure how to pronounce
it because that is pronounced two ways I
get I know you know that but I'm not
sure which one so whichever one you are
hello to you Shannon says Jen I saw you
at IMATS I saw that imac seemed crowded
too but was generation beauty worse than
that regarding lines well this is the
thing about I matson lines IMATS there
are lots and lots and lots of foods they
don't have lines that you can go up to a
generation beauty there isn't a single
booth doesn't have a line every booth
has a line but I a mass is much more
packed there's lots more booze like
you've got at least twice as many booths
that i'm at as there is a generation
beauty so generation beauty there was a
lot more open space for people to walk
so it didn't seem as crowded because of
the more open space but the lines like
you literally could not go to a line
that had something there for you to take
without um without waiting in line it
wasn't going to happen and the only time
the lines died down was when they ran
out of the free products they were
getting the way it's the only time I got
shorter so yes so I'm at some of the
lines are extremely long like if you
want to go to sugar pill if you want to
go to make up for ever if you want to go
to what are some of the other really
really goes 1 Sigma lime crime used to
be really long last year wasn't quite as
long but but lime crime is typically
pretty long if you those lines can you
can wait in those lines Oh Nix Nix is a
really long line you can wait at imax in
those lines for a good hour hour and a
half but it's only those specific
there's only a handful you really have
to wait for a long period of time so yes
and I want to go around in circles I
feel like I've gone I think I covered it
nikki says Jen did you finish that big
coffee no i didn't i ended up drinking
about three quarters of 1 1 cup I didn't
want to overdo it so I didn't the rest
babe will you bring me my coffee
I can't drink it now because it's been
sitting on all night our refrigerator is
full of things that you're supposed to
buy that are like nine million times the
original price so i could put anything
out figures i couldn't refrigerate my
coffee but i'll show you my coffee an
event that got from the restaurant who
said i'm gonna be up all night i need a
big coffee to go and she's like well i'm
a coffee cup but i can give you coffee
to go so i'll show you that anic aayah
says Jen I'm put off for the generation
beauty because I really hate lines and
waiting yeah you wouldn't like it check
this out check out my mega coffee so it
was filled up to the top this is how
much I had in my cup I probably drank
about that much coffee last night but it
worked it worked and I thank the people
what was the restaurant we went to last
night it was called Aurora and it was in
Soho and um and they were super nice our
waitress was amazing the food was
amazing but yeah she packed me out this
to go it was very sweet of her um yeah
and I I'm put off by of generation be
because of the super long lines to staff
says like I would I would like a place
where we can meet up with youtubers like
me being an average jane learning things
and not freak out over the celebrity
stuff yeah and that's the other thing to
the celebrity thing because you guys
know that I am NOT into the YouTube
celebrity thing I don't believe it I
don't buy into it I think it's
ridiculous like I just I can't like I
understand why people would buy into it
I'm not judging people do buy into the
YouTube celebrity thing but girlfriend
like I just it's like it's I doubt you
know not idolatry and like the biblical
sense but it's like the idolatry draw
it's like are you seriously just sit in
the living room and I make makeup videos
like I can wire why are you flipping out
like why i don't i don't know i don't
get it i mean i guess i don't know a
kenny it's one of those things you
either buy in tourney don't and I just
don't buy into it that's just me but
yeah so anyway yeah that's a whole
nother thing I could go on and on about
that but I'm not going to accept
probably get myself in some trouble and
deficits where I was asleep that's like
a gold medal me I know it's tab at the
yeah I got two hours and then two hours
on top of that so what I'm gonna do now
now that i'm down to the end of this set
of comments
okay let me just goldich go down a
little bit Oh Christine says hi Jen
first I'm here I'm enjoying it so far
lovely honesty all thank you for seeing
I'm so glad that you're here fizzy pop
says like maybe half live demos or
speaker and I could people have occupied
while they wait yeah or have like
promise Phan doing like a look up on a
stage like doing like they do at imax
have a stage where she's like up there
doing like makeup like on somebody and
giving techniques and answering
questions and stuff or michelle up on a
stage like and that would that's an
amazing idea ok so fizzy pop gets credit
for that if see if you're watching this
that would be amazing and you should
totally do that because that's something
people could just sit down relax enjoy
and learn something so so smart oh my
gosh you're genius absolutely ok so i
want to get into the swag bag before it
gets too late i said it was only a San
til 1030 but I'm actually going to stay
on longer because i want to show you
what's in my swag bag so this is the bag
from from the event and I did show this
on periscope already but I want to show
you guys so I'm going to hold off on the
comments for a bit because i think that
people will want to see this so first of
all yeah so let me show you what we got
as far as the swag bags just for being a
visitor at generation beauty so
everybody got this this bag right here

the door what's the ding dong all about
hope you're not trying to kick us out I
don't know what the ding dong was about
that's freaking me out ok the cargo HD
CC cream full size and they gave
everybody the shade medium I believe
this mine is medium I'm assuming the
role medium this is the skin Inc puro
viable peel this is the Soho naturals
retractable kabuki brush this is an A
flat concealer brush from a mystery
brand I'm assuming this is from crown
brush what was the ding dong about I
heard a ding dong I heard a weird genome
it was weird

up with that that would have been cool
oh well checkout's at noon cool we have

see the actual shade on here but it's oh
here it is it's in feline and it's like

got an F see the mark anthony oil of
Morocco argan oil hair spray the stuff's

it cosmetics tightline full lash length

anxious to try that this is the a
cosmetics no tug waterproof gel eyeliner

that's way over way over the price of a
ticket um so yes lots of lots of amazing
things and I wish I could scroll down

maybe I should maybe actually just then
I feel bad skipping everybody else's
comments let me see and I want to show

video but I did it really fast i went
through that in like 3-4 minutes in a
little bag I'm just zipping through them
like I'm not reading comments or
meaning i'm sipping through so um i see
i want to keep going i want to show you
everything and i think that's like I
think that's what everyone would want to
see I'm making a judgment call and
thinking everybody will want to see
what's in my swag bag rather than um
which call it rather than John rather
than answering comments or should I do
this in a separate video I don't know I
feel like I don't know should I do like
a video just about this you know i don't

time Nikki helps me with this that's
here nikki nicole marie Lombardo who's
Nicky on the chat here she said for bye
bye under eye to take a tiny bit and
warm it up on your hand before you use
it and that can make a really big
difference she also said to set it with
setting powder so that's what I did and
it worked amazingly Evan I I've on
another thing from even I they give us
this bag here I tried to speed it up
blow dry spray and it really worked it
was amazing I have not tried this one
yet I don't know what that is I don't
recognize that did you bring that I
don't know where that came from that
doesn't look familiar ok the
forget-me-nots dry conditioner and then
the skip the spa thermal hair wrap so
excited to try those too I haven't tried
those but I can tell you that I really
enjoyed this but I don't know if the
blow-dry time was faster because i was
using the hotel dryer or because it was
of this so i have to try it home with my
regular dryer to make sure that it
actually works before i recommended but
it was a positive experience I'm not a
big bag of stuff from essence but I did
try this mascara the lash princess
mascara let me show you the wand it's
not very princess-like I was expecting
to be more alike pretty and it's not
pretty it's a slightly Christmas tree
shaped it's a little bit bigger on the
bottom than the top and it was it was a
nice mascara i would say it's a bad
mascara it clumped a little bit i had to
kind of wiggle a little bit
clumps out but it worked out okay and it
was it was ok I didn't have any flaking
through the day it was fine Oh front oh
my goodness is illuminating blush
stripes I'm just gonna I have to show
you this I have to pause a minute to
show you the amazingness of this like
can you I don't know if you can see the
two tones there but this thing is
amazing like the highlight on this it is
just glowy pop in amazing us and there's
a there's a golden shade down there for
deeper skin tones and warm skin tones oh
my gosh so genius so genius and then the
other one that I use with the laura
geller baked choc lotto vivid squirrel
blush and papaya this was amazing lasted
all day it is just beautiful I
definitely want more of these I look for
these at the birchbark shop they didn't
have them flourish mug shot so I was
unable to get more or else I would have
stocked up girlfriend there are they are
amazing all right next up we got crown
brush 36 colors smoke it out smoky
eyeshadow palette and again if you're
just joining the chant for some reason
if you're just getting here this is the
swag bag I got at the creator's event so
this was in an invite-only party all
right this is the Soho bag that we got
it's a makeup bag just open it up very
quickly for you you show you it's like a
travel makeup bag so it's got like
pockets and it's got a little hanger
there so you can hang it up on a door
and it twists here and it's just a
really nice little bag oh so my essence
F is only parently okay this from shoe
air maybe I'll do like a formal video of
this for those people that missed the
taxes people that may not that might
want to see this I'm this is kind of my
safeguard of in case I don't have time
to film a video of this stuff I could
show get to show lots of people what I
got you where got a bunch of stuff this
is the kid in eyeliner I'm really
excited to try that this is the it's the
shade Twilight if they're long-wear
cream loose eyeshadow show you what that
looks like it's um it's in like a like a
silvery gray like a dark gray and I have
one of these in a neutral shade and it's
got a lot of fallout unfortunately
this is one of their this is called
blushing beauty this is one of their new
little kit things I don't think this has
been a release channel I don't think but
it's got these little things that are
all linked together they're very cute
and they're all linked together there's
a lip gloss a tint and highlighter an
eye shadow I believe a single eyeshadow
and then a little face kit on they're
all like linked together see they like
come apart and have even open the I
should open it really quickly okay so
there's that there and then this one
should open up on this side yes what if
you guys can see that and then hopefully
this one opens this way that would be
smart and it does there you go and
there's that so I'm very excited to play
with fees I have very few products from
jus air so this is nice to have and then
there's a little tote that says friends
don't let friends have bad eyebrows and
I was talking to people on periscope
about this bag that's not my sense of
humor like I don't know I would never
tell my friend that she has bad eyebrows
I'm sorry but never I would never tell a
friend that she has bad eyebrows I guess
I'm not being good friend that according
to you she wear because i'm not telling
my friend that she has bad eyebrows it's
not happening there's so much more to a
friend than her eyebrows you know I'm
saying I got the joke it's cute but it's
just not my humor all right formula x
the cleanse prime and shine I don't know
what shade is nail polish and it might
be the same one but i have bought this
before i purchased this and i love these
products i'm very excited to have new
ones because mine are getting old and
getting low so i'm excited to have
another one of those a double ego
dual-ended crayon por lo oh no some in
French liquid eyeliner and this is in I
don't know what shade it is oh it's this
green shade here all right derma e
purifying two-on-one charcoal mask
Pantene on shadows twilight six color
eyeshadow palette by skin this was a
little hit from skinning so skin see
I think it's how you pronounce it oh
it's not a kid it's just this this thing
here this is the pure deep-sea hydrating
mask which I'm assuming is quite pricing
so I was looking at some of their stuff
and it looks like this point forcing
this here is the skin all with an enzyme
makeup removing cleansing cloths by skin
I use this last night they smell like
orange and they worked really well
tristique this is a brow pencil trying
to go quickly this was a bunch of stuff
from NYX okay I gotta cut it off in 15
minutes at the very latest this is a gel
gel liner yep it's got a little
sharpener on the back they give us a
black one and then they give us a brown
one I think in here somewhere yeah
here's the brown one there you go and
the optics Avant palette which I'm very
excited to try I actually sent that to
my swamp partner when I did those what's
been makeup swamp thingy I said that to
her but I didn't open it or anything I
don't know what it's like on the high
voltage lipstick in this is in twisting
and then this is the NYX whipped there's
actually an orange II kind of corlee one
that I wore and loved it it feels very
mu C to go on but it dries down very
matte I did feel like I needed to
reapply it quite frequently but I did
like this a lot orange one it's in my
first and then this is the Knicks this
is a beach babe bronzer so that's the
next stuff zipping through slipping
through roll the next stuff back in the
bag I mean and this is this is a
ridiculous amount of stuff it's kind of
crazy like how much stuff they gave I
mean I'm so so so so so thankful for the
stuff and this this is definitely like
wait over and above and I think if see
so much for all of this this is another
essence thing my essence bag must have
dumped them going there but we don't
phone the assets like to find it all
this is the blip bliss on buffing
believable smoothing finishing bomb I'm
looking forward to reading your comments
later this is the belief true cream aqua
bomb the chlorine dry shampoo the stuff
is amazing it's my holy grail dry
shampoo it used
be the Battiste for brunettes and then
it became this the only thing i don't
like about this as it comes out like a
fire hose it's like and it doesn't last
very long because so much product comes
out but it works amazingly um okay
benefits two of the gimme brows this is
a little back from get cosmetics with a
wall of stuff in it hey we got the hello
lashes five and one mascara you got me
bye bye pores which I've heard good
things about the vitality lip flush in
agenus a quoi which I'm pretty sure is
brand-new I remember talking about this
and what's up in makeup Oh what is this
it's like clear in the world oh it's a
Reviver form1 Reviver plus palm oil
cherry oil shea butter oil argan oil so
it's like a lip balm ooh that feels nice
it's a lip balm that tastes like cherry
this is really nice I like that I like
that a lot very nice okay and then this
brush I was so excited to see a brush
they love their brushes and I don't know
which one this is it's not written on
here oh here it is heavenly luxe
complexion perfection number 7 and it
says on here conceal so there's a
conceal side and there's an all-over
sign and the brow powder Universal brow
pencil which I do really like this
product a lot and then there's a little
business card in here for it cosmetics
so that was the sufferer make cosmetics
I mean they really went over and above
for the swag bag like uber and evolve
okay here's my assets bag I found that
we're almost to the bottom now we're
almost to the bottom okay we got the
Brad this is this this is for your
lashes it's supposed to extend the
length of your lashes i have used this
before and this was not a product that i
particularly enjoyed it just fell in my
eyes and i don't know it's like almost
like putting baby powder in your
eyelashes that's supposed to lengthen
your lashes I've heard this works very
well for some people it did not work
well for me when I tried to use it but
it was a long time ago so I'm a dump
into it bump em ma used try to use it
again the essence all about graze on
shadow this is that's eight shadows in
there the S
blush up blush powder and I've never
tried a lot of essence so this is a
great opportunity for me to try us as
products and very excited I'm excited to
try this one to make me brow I'm excited
to compare that to the gimme brow from
benefit and see how similar they are
because essence of course is much
cheaper some lipsticks this one is an
eye feels pretty and then this one is
one of the matte ones i believe this is
called barely there yes and then this

essence nail polishes which I've never
tried and I'm so excited to try them

of stuff I guess it's worth the trip
yeah I mean it was definitely worth the
trip it was worth a trip just the meet
people that I got to meet I got to hug
people and that's what makes me happy

something else to hug p KJ says about

periscope is a separate app but it does
feed to twitter so i'm not i'm not
really sure but you can have just like a
lame twitter account you don't use oh
okay yeah you have to sign up with your
phone number you have to use your phone
number because John doesn't have a
Twitter and he has a periscope thank you
John for that Jenny likes periscope as
well the connectivity is bad sometimes I
totally agree nikki says OMG jelly offer

talk with them more because I've been in
love with Oprah since the very first
liquid lipstick i stood up tried from
them my boxy charm years ago and i was
telling them that like i fell in love
immediately with that liquid lipstick
and I was before Olympic liquid
lipsticks were a rage they said that
they on they were they claimed that they
were the ones who invented the liquid
lipstick and it was so long ago I don't

liquid lipsticks they're amazing Oh
