been waiting 12 minutes all right
so hello my friends thank you for your
patience I appreciate it I guess it
received restart my computer so it's a
day let me do my intro over again today
we're going to talk about makeup brushes
I'm going to be showing you some makeup
brushes that I own that I really really
like it all different price points I'm
also going to be talking to you about
different brush shapes and what brush
shakes are typically used for what
purposes and then the dry brushes and
face brushes we're also going into yeah
everything's better all right good so
I'm gonna talk about what brushes are
good for what purposes typically what
they're used for and then we're gonna be
talking about what else I had a great
intro and I said it and you couldn't
hear a word I'm saying um well yeah just
different different brushes what they're
used for different brushes at different
price points and um yeah I think that
was it I think there were other things
too but I forgot that in all of the
craziness alright so let's go ahead and
get started but before we do if you're
watching this on the replay I'm gonna
take just a second say hello to the
people who have stuck with me and the
collective grain of makeup awesomeness
thank you so much for staying oh my gosh
so I'm just gonna say hello
what what what forehead is cut off oh my
gosh can this thing get any crazy art
it's Mercury retrograde or what
alright my forehead is cut off how's
that is that better you're on your what
does that mean tab what does that mean
oh I'm so thankful that I have friends
that watch the show so I can open
alright now that I've checked myself
before I've wrecked myself talk about
some makeup brushes but actually no I
gotta say hello to the collective brain
so let me say hello cuz everything looks
good now hmm good morning Nicole and
Jenice and what's going fast all right
Nora man good morning sahaja glad to
have you back from your travels oh my
goodness okay
finally the Hajj is finally back hi miss
candy good to see you
just got some RT Stoops and love them I
did not jump into the RTS the whole RT
stream I don't watch a lot of tutorials
so I don't really see a lot of artists
being used so I mostly just watch
reviews and I haven't watched a lot of
Artie's for me so I don't know anything
about those so candy maybe could be our
expert on those Heather hello good
morning good morning to Terry the
morning Jennie sue the morning dubs one
Felicia Jackie I DIY beauty hello in
Colorado hello mark yeah I need to know
oh good I'm so glad good morning to
Alexis and Christine and Nancy good to
have you here and Heather and Liz and
Kat and Sabrina the makeup mom and
that's AB you whole four one one and oh
let's see gore delicious
that's all pink doll nice hello in
Puerto Rico
hello Melia and kala and Nicola yay or
nay Nicole Carolyn good morning janista
morning Elise yay okay I'm gonna go
ahead and scroll down if I didn't say
hello to you good morning good morning
to you so let's go ahead and start with
let's start with eye brushes because
those are my favorites I felt like I
thought I should probably start with
face brushes but I love me some eye
brushes now one thing before I start
that I want to make sure you know is
there are no steadfast rules of what you
can and cannot use you cannot use this
brush for this and you cannot use this
brush that you have to use what works
for you but this is typical of what
people use for what at least in my
opinion from what I've seen that's what
the brain can correct me if they would
like so the first kind of brush I feel
like is the kind of brush that I think
everybody needs what in the world now my
aunt's calling me goodness hang up I'll
call you back
alright anyway so you scroll down so I
can see the collective brain
this one right here is truly I think if
you're gonna buy one makeup brush this
is it that one right there
you need a flaps
like it's not completely flat it's not
like this it's not completely flat it's
kind of domed a little bit but rounds it
like this something like that this is
for packing on color the it cuts down a
little bit lower so it's got a little
bit of a taper so another thing you need
to know is that the product picks up on
the ends of the bristles so wherever you
see the bristles poking out that's how
much product you're going to take off so
when you have a brush like this where
it's just the bristles on the top here
this is more for spreading than it is
for picking up product so this is a
concealer brush we'll talk about that in
a minute but this brush is the brush you
need a sieve but like a Seabrook well
the thing is it's about a seed brush the
elsie brush that gets too small for me I
don't like ones that are that short
because I find it difficult to work with
yes that one is really really tiny
I do need a whiteboard I need a
whiteboard so I can draw your best
pictures but the top one it is so so
small I don't really like that one but
that's just me that's just me okay
okay all right we're good so and you can
get these at all price points every
price point everybody's got a brush like
this okay so that you need the other one
if you're going to get a second brush is
a blending brush okay
this is my favorite one this is the pro
crease brush by beauty junkies beauty
junkies is my favorite eyeshadow brush
brand these were sent to me for review a
long time ago but I had just bought a
couple months before some Sigma brushes
and they're pretty much exactly the same
so I don't really the Sigma brushes are
great don't get me wrong they're
fantastic brushes but I feel like if you
can get them for half the price you
might as well get the PD junkies ones
and that's from my heart and any reviews
you do you watch of beauty junkies
you'll see in the comments below
everybody that's bought beauty junkies
that I didn't pay you know that says hey
these things are awesome so I do not
have any Dell iam tools unfortunately I
don't but yes blending brush is
definitely something that you want now
there's different kinds of blending
brushes depending on what you want to do
the more densely packed your brushes the
more color it's going to pick up because
there's more bristles to pick up that
product so this one is going to pick up
than this one this one's also going to
spread the product out further okay so
if you want to get something that's a
little more detailed look if you're
trying to get up into your crease you
want one like this this one is the
tapered blending brush by beauty junkies
this one I use just for blending out
existing color that's already there or
if I just want a little bit of color
because you see how fluffy it is it also
bends a lot more I don't know if you can
see that it bends more this one is a
little more stiff so it's easier to work
with to put the color in where this one
is more for like you know making color
that's already there move okay likies
blurb says she likes a julep brushes I
do like julep brushes I have a couple in
here that we'll talk about one of the
most essential makeup brushes for
beginning beginners and your opinion
these two these two right here but you
don't have to get them from beauty
junkies you can find these you can find
Ecotools makes really great brushes Real
Techniques makes really great brushes
elf there's some really great elf
brushes there also some really bad elf
brushes but there's some really great
elf brushes but these two right not
these two these two right here no these
two you know a blending brush and a flat
shader brush your done okay so then it
brushes are typically cruelty free
because they are there in synthetic
they're not made out of animal products
so I mean you can double check on the
website to see but I'm pretty sure that
they are cruelty free because there are
synthetic products but you never know
you never know and some of some animal
hair brushes they claim to be cruelty
free because they they take the the
bristles from brushing the the live
animal they're their acquired through
natural hair loss not from doing
something to the N one and stealing
their their hair so it depends on what
your level of cruelty free is whether
you use no animal products at all or
whether they can be naturally removed
from the animals so well techniques is
fabulous and Ecotools brushes are great
too Michelle says for giving beginners
on the bus on a budget Jessop makes a
good set with eye and face brushes
they're like $15 a set yes very nice
and then Betty Ann says real techniques
are fabulous dubs once it's royal and
langnickel model motor brushes are
really good but she butchered the
spelling that's okay Cheryl says I've
been seeing BH brushes and palates and
t.j.maxx lately BH Cosmetics their stuff
is very hidden yes very hidden mess you
can get some really great stuff from BH
Cosmetics like the Carli bybel palette
the galaxy chic palette and I you know I
have a couple of their brushes they're
not standout brushes but they're decent
but get the job done
Marc wants to know while I review the
niki tutorial Calot yes I will I've only
used it once though so yes there will be
a review of that palette they guess the
beauty junkies from Florio Gerudo agreed
okay so you got this one you've got
you've got this one in this one in this
one so these this is three if you want
to buy three brushes this is your number
one you must have this one this is your
number two and this is your number three
your number four if you must is
something like this this is a pencil
brush pencil brushes are really really
good for defining so if you're trying to
get color right into that outer v it's
really great you can use this for lower
lash line it's really really nice this
is again beauty junkies pencil brush
these are the ones I use like I just
grabbed the ones that I use this isn't
these are the ones they use duh I have
one by Wayne Goss and number 20 brush
that one's fantastic it's pretty much
the same shape I actually think that
that one is of higher quality than this
one but they pretty much do the same
thing I mean in the end Lingus ones
probably a little bit better but you
know it's not enough of a difference for
the price for me but pencil brushes are
fantastic I haven't found any in the
drugstore either that are think are
amazing let me see this is the Sigma e30
so this is the beauty junkies and this
is the Sigma e30 this is the Sigma
tapered blending and then this is the
beauty junkies so you can see they're
like both of them and I don't know about
pencil brushes the drugstore to be
honest maybe some other people know
fillet says she loves though ava brushes
dub says they sell them at Walmart now
the blending brush is my favorite ever
over
t24 yeah i don't know any mac brushes no
Mac brushes and SS cuz you recommend a
good eyeliner brush to use with
eyeshadow to line your eyes instead of
liquid or gel liner yes that's that
would be the next brush that was next
one's going to talk to you so this is
your number four okay
in my opinion important brushes to get
your number five important brush to get
is some kind of flat these are filthy
cool I use them for gel liner in their
most their mess okay this one is
Ecotools and it's a mess and needs to be
washed but these are really good they're
just like flat angled brushes these are
great for like Anna was saying to put in
a shadow to give you some eyeliner you
dip it in your eyeshadow and you like a
deep eyeliner eye you dip it in a deep
colored eyeshadow and you apply it like
eyeliner you can do it also on the lower
lash line Kat says she loves Wayne Goss
brushes for the face morphine's away
before the eye weight gospel he doesn't
make great brushes I haven't had any
luck with morphe brushes but I also
don't own very many of them amber says
first time chatting live yeah he's so
happy to have you here and then Michelle
says she loves this brush so this is a
really really good one really any brush
that's this shape flat and angled is
really good for that you can also use
this for gel liner you can use this for
for lower lash line upper lash line
whatever you want to use it for so
really really nice and again this is
Ecotools but just just look for a shape
like this alright so and then of course
with you if you don't have a spoolie if
you don't have a spoolie that came with
your eyebrow pencil this is another one
that's really good to have this one is
the J cap UD Pro makeup one so it's a
spoolie on one side and then it's like a
brow slash eyeliner one on the other
side because you can use that for brows
too for brows though I prefer for me
personally for brows I prefer wears it
here's my winged boss let me show you
that from here to this is the beauty
junkies and this is the winged goes the
Wayne Goss is just a little bit nicer on
a mat where is my brow brush there's so
many brush okay here we go this is by
Real Techniques to see how its thicker I
thought they
bushy brows so this is a little bit
thicker so I really like to have this in
for filling in my brows for powder for
powder brow products for gel brow
products for likely dip brow pomade
things like that I use the the ther one
but for thicker ones I use this kind so
this is the real technique that's from
there I set it's very very nice Jodie
says am I the only one who doesn't like
dual ended brush as I hate storing them
Jodie I do not think you're alone
Jodie has a great youtube channel by the
way it's called yodelin Johto y ou de li
n je o da yodelin Jo de it's a fantastic
YouTube channel you should definitely
check it out I've never shouted out
Jodie on chaps for so I got to make sure
I do that
all right she'll says love that purple
Real Techniques brush yes it's good
isn't it it's really good mark says any
beauty hacks Jen for back to school
makeup beauty hacks for back to school
keep it simple
that's my hack keep it simple because
going back to school going in with like
Instagram face you may not be the best
idea I don't know I mean cuz I feel like
when you're there to learn like you know
we're a little BB cream little nude eye
a little liner maybe some or double demi
whispies but you know crazy you know I
mean like you're not like I don't know
that's my opinion
keep it simple keep it simple for school
because you need to learn you know like
you know it's a little distracting with
person next she looks like they've got
you know contours cut you I mean that's
my opinion
is anyway this year this is something I
haven't talked about this is also by
wing boss I got this in the beauty lush
lucky bag I really like this this is
really great for eyebrows use this for
my eyebrows now this I have never tried
to wave a true beauty it Cheryl says it
face brushes Holy Grail it cosmetics
doesn't make fantastic face brushes this
is supposed to be used for eyelashes I
have never found success for the comb
for eyelashes like ever ever like I
don't even know like I guess that works
I don't know I just like when I wear
mascara it kind of unless you get to it
pretty quick too
Russia it's gonna dry and it's gonna be
hard to come out I don't know I've never
really used this I do use this for my
brow sometimes it's nice you see if
there's anything else I why's anything
else I missed collective brain on eye
wise
Nicole from yay or nay Nicole another
great YouTube channel says I use a comb
for my lashes with a metal brush if it
gets too clumpy and it saves her
fantastic terylene ft and thrifty
another one Oh once you fast I lost you
another YouTube channel great YouTube
channel there's a lot of great YouTube
channels in here lol no Instagram face
for back-to-school Lauren says what is
the cheapest quality pencil brush that
you have found and honestly it's
probably the beauty junkies but I know
you have to buy it online you can buy
them on Amazon if you type in beauty
junkies they do have an Amazon store but
then you can go to the beauty junkies
website to to get them a lot of times
you can go on YouTube and search for
recent videos by beauty junkies and
they'll have a discount code and then
you can take that in that's the little
cheater suggestion
so oh lucky brushes Catherine downing
another YouTube channel love the Lexi
brushes Lexi does make great brushes
we'll get into those all right okay oh
okay so this is another brush that I use
for eyeshadows sometimes this is a domed
brush by Real Techniques it's the bold
metals collection the Real Techniques
float Bowl milk metals collection is
really nice but it's kind of pricey but
I do enjoy it so I use this for packing
color up into my crease sometimes but
you can also use it underneath your eyes
like this like that Kristen says I still
have a beauty junkies coupon code till
1/8 31 if anyone wants it you get
nothing in yourself Kristen what's the
code Kristen game if you're not
subscribed Kristen game you need to go
subscribe because Kristen game right now
Kri STI n G ehm this is becoming me just
promoting my friends I apologize for
that personal quarter code up put it put
it in the chat and I'll read it one
Kristen
Kri STI n alright
yes because my codes expired my one I
had but you know she doesn't benefit
from it it's just a discount code okay
um Caroline says I have a few brushes
that are so good I've had them for years
and can identify them any more I have a
couple of those too I definitely have a
couple of those
all right so let's move on to other
brushes that are a little bit smaller
we'll go small to large so oh my
goodness it's already 10:30 because we
got 15 minutes hmm
at 15 minutes whatever not being able to
talk to you okay concealer brushes
there's a couple of different kinds of
brushes that you can use for concealer
at least I think that are good for
concealer I have all these different
ones okay so one of them is the
traditional concealer brush I personally
don't like flat brushes like this I feel
like I'm like just painting my face I
don't like it I don't like brushes like
this it just feels like I'm Bob Ross and
all up on my face and it just it's
uncomfortable it doesn't feel nice I
don't like them but some people love
these things
people also use flat brushes for
applying eye creams the big ones for
face masks things like that
Loreena says fingers work best for
concealer and I agree with most
concealers usually what I'll do is I'll
Pat it off with my fingers and if it
seems to be blending okay I let it be
but some concealers I find work better
blended with a brush that they're not as
streaky sometimes they go on streaky so
it just depends on which concealer so
these are brushes that I've used for
concealer these are this is a set and
honestly I use all of them
interchangeably what is this oh another
great brush brand is outer beauty I used
to be addicted to them and so I found
beauty junkies once and they're cheaper
so I started using those but brushes
like this are kind of what I use for
concealer they're very dense and they're
smaller they just kind of fit under the
under eye and these are good for powder
products they're good for cream products
they're very very nice gentle wants to
know about the Beauty Blender all of
those sponges the Beauty Blender sponge
beauty junkies makes a sponge the real
techniques I mean everybody seems to be
making sponges at this point sponges are
great for applying products I'm not
gonna get into a whole lot of sponges
right now just because I don't have a
lot to show you and prepare that it's
parallel brushes but the blending
sponges are fantastic but there's like
the application technique when you go to
wet it and all that stuff so it's really
how much you want to put into it as far
as the process for putting on your
makeup so I personally sometimes
get lazy and don't feel like going all
the way to the bathroom like a whole you
know 15 feet to the bathroom and wet
this woman so Shelley says she uses a
sponge for under her eyes and I think a
lot of people do absolutely Nicole for
me I near quote Nicole says Beauty
Blender is her fave two for $30 at
Costco calm right now and you can pick
which color you like that's awesome
Steph says that the sponge is great
under eye because it's pointed yes
agreed agreed
Marc wants to know which brushes you're
holding Grail the ones that I showed you
the flat one the beauty junkies brushes
the flat one flat shader brush I mean
they're all you know a lot of brushes
are really interchangeable though really
truly in my opinion but I'm not a makeup
artist this is just for me having
experience just doing it on myself so as
Lena says she's the concealer brush for
packing on shimmer shadow spray it with
fix+ and watch how much better it
applies better than a better excite than
a regular packing brush she tastes very
nice
Terry makeup lover says the beauty
junkies assert is the best of her
opinion too okay so here these right
here concealer brushes that's what I use
if I miss any other ones I just I'm
pulling them out as I go another one
that I really like to use for under eyes
is this one this is my under eye go to
brush this is the Real Techniques
setting brush and this is fantastic
if you um you have like a I don't
because everybody's different I was
gonna say in what tone but everybody's
different so I'm not gonna say that but
like a powder setting powder that you
put under your eyes this brush is like
amazing for that or if you just want to
spot powder everywhere super awesome
really great brush true beauty says
beauty blenders are the best thing ever
and the only thing that comes closest to
the Sigma f80 which I own and I'll show
you that in a bit Sabrina says why don't
I why don't I have anything from beauty
junkies really the first time I've ever
heard that oh it's fantastic it's
fantastic so yes right here and then
that's when Beauty Hall for one says yes
Jen my favorite setting brush for the
under eye yes this one is amazing and
then Sarah says use it for highlighter
yes you can use this for highlighter you
can use it for contouring
stippling brush we'll get into that
that's great good idea getting the
stippling brushes
this is a crown brush stippling brush
sibling just means that it's kind of
like pokey this is the elf small simple
brush which I think everybody that does
YouTube videos owns the elf small
stipple brush I think I would imagine I
don't have a whole lot of stippling
brushes I don't really use them that
often this one and I don't have a lot of
experience with them they're not my
thing but the elf small stippling brush
I feel like is a must-have it's three
dollars and I use this for blush you can
use this for concealer even if you want
to dab it in a little concealer and go
like that and dabble it on it's supposed
to create like an airbrushed kind of
effect this is fantastic he really says
she loves the Real Techniques stippling
brush it's her favorite Mac sibling
brushes are the ones that Carolyn uses
and Michelle says is anyone on the back
of cashmere shedding disaster brush is
that what it's called the cashmere is
shedding disaster patch that wasn't a
very strategic name just kidding elf
stippling brush yes this is amazing if
you have cream blush products and that's
what I use this the most for is cream
blush products this one right here the
crown brush one that's kind of domed I
like using this for really pigmented
blushes like my own Oh what brand is
that it's like I can picture what it
looks like I could picture it my brain
but I can't remember the brand it's like
there's a blank in my head but for
really super pigmented blushes that Lisa
is really nice because the bristles are
so spread out that you can really
control how much blush you get on your
face and then you can always blend it
out a bit so speaking of that let's move
on to blush brushes smaller blush
brushes this one
amazing amazing amazing frozen
unfortunate place oh no Maliha what do I
look like in case you don't know I'm
very not photogenic at all so if for
whatever reason your computer freezes or
you pause my videos chances are I'm
gonna be making an insane face I just I
some women you pause their video
anywhere and they look gorgeous I don't
know how that happens like how do they
look beautiful
all the stinking time I am NOT that
person Oh at all but yeah this will
techniques both mountains brush is
really wonderful if they're blush brush
I love it because it's tapered all the
way down so this is really nice for
blushes that are buildable the ones that
aren't so so pigmented Anna says it sir
this is Haram Holy Grail Erica says it's
her favorite blush brush roll technique
gold medals I love it when there's when
I bring out something in your legs yes
that's my favorite too and it's like I
you know I kind of know what I'm talking
about this stuff makes me kind of åland
a you know it's awesome so mark
says Jen how can I pick up more pigment
in an elf smudge pot finger use your
finger and apply it with your finger
that's the best way to to get any extra
pigmentation is to use your finger
because we think about the brush Lois
thing about the bristles the bristles
are where the product picks up so your
finger is gonna pick up product all over
it instead of just on bristles so
anytime you apply something with your
fingertips you're gonna probably get
more pigmentation than you would with a
brush but that's why people like to use
brushes I think for a lot of products
because you don't want solid
pigmentation let you think about a
finger swatch for blush you don't want
that on your face because it's just
gonna be too much just give me too much
unless that's the look you're going for
pink go for it but yeah so so so yeah if
you always if you want something more
pigmented try your fingers but yeah so
this blush brush is super fast super fab
oh let's see okay contouring this is
this is my favorite well not my favorite
brush for contouring it used to my
favorite for contouring this is the luxe
e5o for a large angled brush I love
brushes like this for contouring
like I said they use it for blush too
but right there yes flora sent me a new
picture hum from punching let's see
Kat said Oh a dragon rebel some use a
stippling brush for foundation what
other brushes are good for that yes
that's very true that's very true
this is this is really nice and then
Nicole was like yeah I love love the
Luxy brush she had these things her
friends eyes she said she has three of
them candy says so glad I made this
someday I missed all your other live
shows I haven't seen you in forever
candy I'm so glad that you're here are
you gonna make videos again I think you
stopped making videos
yeah this one is really really fantastic
Sarah loves it Nancy loves it it's
really really nice it just i love the
angle for the way that it fits on the
face to go down it just feels good it's
super soft Briana wants to know do you
use the slant the slanted crease brush
by Ecotools it's a weird brush that I
never use no that thing's weird I don't
use that I think it's very odd I don't
even know where that brush is to be
completely honest dub says elf has a
stipple travel set very interesting I
did not know that Oh candy says she's
editing three videos right now Miss
candy mi asked kam di alright so contour
yes yes yes where's my fave right here
like if a brush could glow with like an
aura of like amazingness and like oh
like almost like you know the sword the
stone it just like pops up like this and
you remove it from the stone and it's
all this magical Ness this brush right
here this is the Yves pearl fan brush
it's kind of pricey but man is this
brush amazing I use this for blush I use
it for contour I use it for highlight
it's just the perfect shape the perfect
Brent blendability it's just amazing so
yes on this definitely the other one I
want to show you is the julep one
hopefully I have it right here I know
that I used it a couple days ago but the
thing about fan brushes okay
fan brushes oh yeah Harry Potter market
says Harry Potter wants that when your
hair blows like okay the thing about fan
brushes like the elf fan brush the elf
fan brush is basically like a very very
thin strip of brush and it's completely
not completely useless the only thing I
would use the elf fan brush for is if
you have glitter on your face and you
want to brush it off or if you have it
fall out extra product you can brush it
off with a fan brush which is kind of
nice but other than that it's relatively
useless because there aren't enough
bristles to pick up product to be
functional so this one right here
amazing perfect perfect perfect perfect
so anything that looks like this but you
also don't what one that's
really big because you don't when you're
contouring you want to be specific about
where you're putting it or the highlight
you want to put its be specific so when
you're the brush is too big it's bit
more difficult to work with so I feel
like this size is the perfect size
that's my personal opinion
Brianna I don't know how much it is off
the top of my head I got it I'm asked a
couple years ago but I want to say it's
like twenty dollars something like that
it's kind of pricey so hmm Josi wants to
know what do you think about morphe
brushes I've only ever owned one morphe
brush and I did not like it I think it
was one of their lower quality brushes
and I got it a subscription box a long
time ago I really should buy some morphe
brushes just to try them but yeah I just
haven't I haven't gotten into morphe
brushes so I don't know unfortunately
Sarah says Ecotools fan brush is better
than most that's great to know anna says
I've heard great things that Wayne Goss
fan brush good to know that one's Paul
Rowles runs what those things are really
expensive
Briana she's heard that morphe brushes
do not last long yeah I don't know
anything about that
I don't know mmm Jodi says I have far
too many I'll send you some you know I
was almost to where people send stuff I
really do weird people set up their Pio
boxes send me stuff sandy stuff and I'm
like hiding my eyes Presley I always
feel bad like I feel really bad yeah
Jeni Eve pearl brush is $35 Thank You
Beth from Beauty hall for one one
excellent Instagram Thank You $35 Atkins
$35 for a brush what was I thinking
like really I paid $35 for this I must
have been like I don't even know all
right
uh let's see Anna says I'm not missing
out on working brushes well the
community seems to not really like
morphe brushes
does anybody here like morphe brushes
Cheryl says morphe brushes shed like
crazy
Danae says how do I like the julep fan
brush today it's too big it's too big my
friend um it's just too big and I don't
know where it is hold on let me just
look over at my desk real quick and see
if I can find it because I was just
using it I don't nobody did with it it's
thing I don't know yeah I don't know
where I put it
I'll find it as soon as this is over I
will find it it's one of those things or
if I dig deep enough maybe I'll find it
alright so blush brushes let's see okay
I've also used this one this is the
julep brush this is the bronzer brush oh
okay so now we're into face brush clams
let me get pull out some face brushes
here's some really good ones will go to
foundation the last do foundation
brushes last will do powder products
first some ones that I really like okay
powder products okay so highlighting
this shape is really awesome this is the
pro highlighting brush by beauty junkies
this is really nice for highlighting for
contour do you see how it's like cuts
down there's lots of space for the
product to pick up right here so
Adrienne I don't have a peel box nope
could somebody um time out people I put
some more mods on get them got some
creepy people up in the chat alright so
anyway so I've got um sorry I got
distracted this is not a good for cream
highlighter I would definitely not
recommend this for cream um for cream
highlighters for cream products you want
to use products that are more dense more
flats and honestly what I do with cream
products cream highlighters is all apply
them with my fingertips and then I'll
stipple them out so thank you tab um
people are distraught dirt
people are saying creepy things like
being on periscope but yeah so I really
love this shape of brush for
highlighters for powder highlighters
yeah absolutely
another one that I really like is this
Vasanti one these are great for blush
again it's got that nice taper it's got
a really nice blend Brent bend to it
this is it doesn't have a number on it
but it's five basanti it's a really nice
brush brand I got this in a subscription
box as well very nice Liz says I think
morphe sends you tubers brushes and they
have to give a positive review I don't
know anything about
I know more if he sends a lot of brushes
out to people but I don't know if they
have to guarantee a positive review I
don't know the name of the NARS that
what is the name of the NARS squared off
the that that ISA
is is ills did I sound like an idiot the
NARS contour brush
it's got a weird name it's like is Ilse
something you guys know you guys don't
time and I saw a complete idiot but I
forget what it's called
Pisa ISA the ISA Itza brush the e2 brush
thank you so much chicken think of it I
don't own that I don't know anything I
don't own anything like that but I've
heard really great things I'm super
quiche says morphe isn't terrible just
overrated good you know Lana's said it's
time to get a peel bucks I do have an
address on my husband's studio tattoo
heart studios we have the addresses in
the About section of my of my youtube
channel so if you really want to address
that one sitting over there all right
other brushes the jewel always talk
about the julep bronzer brush but this
can also be used for face powder this is
the one I use the most for face powder
this is the Real Techniques blush brush
but I love this for face powder it's
super fab it's really nice I keep my
brushes in this I got this at Target I
believe it's just an organizer caddy
it's got different sections so that's
how I keep my brushes and I keep pair of
scissors because I'm always trying to
cut something open but yeah that's where
I keep my brushes but yes this is
fantastic
miss candy says I need to guess body
your husband's studio so you can hang
out that would be amazing candy I'd be
fantastic I pulled this one out but this
is I don't even know who makes this I
don't know I'm trying to think it's my
skin I think is the name of the brand I
think I got this in um I definitely got
this in an event like generation beauty
or something
but this is nice for blush as well I
think it's skin the little eye SK iin
I'm pretty sure it's not written on the
brush so I'm doing it from memory but
yes this is nice too but anything this
shape in the shape so when you're in the
store looking for brushes you really
want to look and look for density
because if you don't see the density for
blush brushes you're not going to pick
up a lot of product and it's not going
to be good for you so Jeff down Lee be
careful when you're picking up brushes
in the store and look for something that
looks like it's well constructed look
for things that look dense you want this
density okay I feel like that's the
biggest thing for shopping for brushes
that you can't touch in the store let's
the other four pound oh this is this
one's really good oh I almost didn't
tell you this is this is by Ecotools I
just got this not that long ago
this is their mattifying finish brush oh
my gonna so break for mineral foundation
mineral powders things like that oh it's
fantastic fantastic and almost know if I
have any favorite Sephora brand brushes
kind of think I used to own Sephora
brand brushes but then I don't know what
happened they're kind of pricey and I
don't think they're that much better
than other brushes so I don't know I
don't know I I haven't bought any in a
while Anna I just haven't
I just haven't but this one's really
really nice Lauren says y'all are the
best I'm telling you this is the best
YouTube community on all of YouTube if
you're not part of our Facebook group
we're having a giveaway right now we're
gonna let people into the group starting
tomorrow I believe because we're doing a
facebook only giveaway it's a huge
awesome giveaway but tomorrow we're
start letting people into the Facebook
group again I think Tabitha yes and then
definitely the Facebook group if you
enjoy a really great beauty community
because people are amazing if you need
have questions about this stuff so oh
okay so now let's get into foundation
brushes because it is 1049 I know I
missed 15 minutes if we feel like we
still have things we want to talk about
we can stay on a little late because I
came on so late but oh wait hold on a
minute hold on a minute I did not show
you a couple of brushes on where's like
the elf blush brush is amazing and I
don't know where it is so oh here we go
julep fan brush down bit look at the
difference in size so this is a Facebook
group name is slash what's up in makeup
what's up in makeup so search for that
under groups you should be able to find
it look at the difference in in shape in
size
so yes this one is way more functional
this one is too big feels great but it's
bendy like the brush the bristles are
really long if you think about the the
length of the bristles it bends so it's
really difficult to get it to go where
you want it to go because it's like I'm
trying to put on the product and the
bristles are bending back and forth and
it's like no I don't want the bristles
to Bend
I want the brush to move you know but if
it's too bendy it doesn't move so I'm
not a big fan of this one it's difficult
to use but it is nice if you've got
stuff you want to brush off your face
because it is so there's so many
bristles and it's so big you can really
get large areas to brush fallout or
glitter off your face
alright foundation brushes back to
foundation brushes I know it's going to
do that a minute ago alright so I think
okay here good so this is the
traditional flat brush this is a makeup
forever brush again I don't like flat
brushes but a lot of people do like them
a lot can we use these for face masks
but I just I don't like this this kind
of brush I just feel like I'm slathering
it on my face and like so yeah Michelle
says are you supposed to paint on wool
with that brush too big I know right I
know so yes so I don't really like these
kinds of brushes that's just me
personally for foundation you have lots
of different shaped choices really what
you're looking for foundation is density
density is what's going to give you that
smooth look to your foundation you don't
want to use a product a brush like this
or foundation because it's going to get
all clumped up inside the bristles and
it's not going to give you an even
application it's going to give you a
streaky application so you see the
difference between the density of like
so it's it's you definitely want to use
a more dense thick brush for foundation
Heather says she likes it for masks yes
you can't see me what happened
what no not again seriously I can see me
I look like I can see me seriously all
right hold on
you
okay are we back hopefully we're back I
just went out and came back in please
tell me we're back back still can't see
okay okay all right so if you if you're
in the chat and you can't see me then go
out and come right back so okay we're
good I don't know what is up with the
chat today not functional you know
they're changing the format of chat I
thought I saw that on a video on YouTube
that they're changing this whole thing I
don't know what they're changing I don't
know how they're tricking I don't know
what it's going to be but in the coming
weeks things are going to be different I
think it's the beginning of September
they're changing it they're doing
YouTube live instead of hangouts on air
so we'll have to see what happens with
that and we'll roll with the punches as
it goes hopefully we can still do chat
anyway foundation brushes goodness
gracious oh we're gonna get to these so
you really want a dense brush Jenny go
out and come back okay usually use your
fingers for liquid products I use a Real
Techniques buffing brush for powders and
and fingers will work with some
foundations for me I feel like it goes
on streaky with my fingers I feel like I
have trouble getting a nice finish with
my fingers so true beauty says Sigma f80
is amazing for where the Real Techniques
buffing brush it's not quite as good but
it's a ton cheaper yes but people are
saying they can't see me again okay I
think we're good okay but if it works
for you definitely use your fingers I
just can't I'm not that skilled
apparently so this is the flat kabuki
brush this I feel like is a really
common shape of brush for foundation
just really nice to go on it just feels
good it smooths everything out it's just
a really nice traditional foundation
brush using a kabuki like this this is
the tapered kabuki this was really nice
for getting under the under eyes and
really smoothing things around in
specific areas getting it hairlines Josi
says fingers will leave it blotchy and
if you're skilled maybe maybe it doesn't
leave it blotchy yeah so I'm reading the
comments over here but yeah this is a
really nice I mean I music I kind of use
it interchangeably I don't
one more than the other it's just kind
of whatever I grab Lauren says she likes
the word canoe key it is a great great
worry I feel like I have hair on my face
some kind of brush hay or something
another but yeah so I feel like these
are kind of most functional for
foundation this one here I was hanging
out with my friend Sandra that I
actually met through the community and
this is the Marc Jacobs the face to
brush and love this brush I really was
hoping that I wouldn't love it so I
could return it I think this is like a
$40 $50 brush something stupid but it's
really good I have to say but you know
do I see that big of a difference over
brushes like these no I don't I don't
see that big of a difference I mean
maybe maybe it makes it I'm sorry I'm
getting just drunk distracted by the
chat okay all right I just want to make
sure everybody's okay
maybe if you're doing Instagram pictures
you might be able to see the difference
between different brushes like this or
using a Beauty Blender I guess using a
Beauty Blender I think is different you
can see a difference in the finish of
the foundation but I personally like
when I look in the mirror I can't really
tell a difference between when I apply
using one brush or another they just
kind of all look the same it's really
just how much fun you have use any
different brushes how easy the
application is so Josi says the Marc
Jacobs it it really is good it's a great
brush but a super key she says I kind of
hate it when expensive items are worth
it yeah me too me too but I really
wanted to try it cuz I own a lot of
super expensive brushes maybe my game
would be more on point if I owned worse
is Michelle says they use fingers for
cream blush but they're the list they're
the list as yeah and I I use my fingers
for cream blush a lot too I apply it and
then I just can't
but the stippling brush is also really
nice too I'm trying to miss anything any
other brush shapes that I missed I think
that pretty much got everything that I
wanted to show you there's like weird
brushes like this is the flawless
radiance brush by bare minerals like
this is a weird-looking gosh I mean I
would imagine this would be good for
powder or between this and this so this
density is powder this density is
foundation so this is
powder this is cream elf buffing brush
works for foundation Jenna says that's
good to know
that's good to know
Japanese brushes I got a couple of polka
hoto brushes from the Sephora Pro set
and honestly like they're fine they're
good but I don't see a huge difference
and I think makeup artists probably see
a bigger difference than I do so
seriously I'm seeing no picture again
Jen this is ridiculous this is not me
this is YouTube now at this point yes
tablet says remember chat next week is
evening chat at 5 p.m. Eastern yes that
is true
alright let me go out and come back
okay so hopefully I should I'm back now
this is this is crazy okay alright it
Jenson Michelle says Jen just keep
talking with listening calm down and go
on it's ugly I'm back okay so anyway so
the Hakka Jota brushes I bet makeup
artists can tell the difference between
these things the Japanese brushes and
the not Japanese brushes I don't see
that big of a difference I don't know I
think it's maybe just I don't have that
good a technique to notice so if you
were just a regular old person putting
your makeup on I really don't think it's
necessary to buy super expensive
Japanese brushes I really don't I don't
know I feel like that the beauty junkies
Russians honestly is really all you need
because I feel like like you can get a
nice look I mean I don't know oh no oh
so like little brushes like this I don't
like because they're too small I don't
feel like they pick enough enough
product we were talking about that
earlier about small brushes and then I
just found one so does anybody have any
questions or comments or anything they
want to share we are gonna end chat
pretty soon because I ran out of things
to show you I'm kind of done with all
the stuff that I showed you so but if
there's anybody in the collective brain
has anything that you want to UM to talk
about let me know Oh Carolyn says not
the Sephora mocha hoto the real ones are
the best you tell me that it's not a
real photo what oh my goodness those
were good for the crease oh you talking
like a little small month candy says the
little brushes worked good for the
crease yes for detailing like up in the
crease for getting like a cut crease or
whatever little ones
Patricia wants to know a good lip brush
I am an toilet brush we use what brushes
I just don't have the patience because
they have to be kind of tiny and like to
paint my whole lip with a lip brush they
are nice though for like getting around
the outside almost like almost like
using a lip liner you can use a good a
lip brush for that but I'm not a lip
person I'm more of a night person so I
don't really have any suggestions for
that unfortunately cuz I don't use them
I should start using them now that I'm
using some deeper
lipstick colors Sarah says urban decay
just came out with brushes look nice but
expensive yes anna says best lending
brush for the crease definitely this one
pro crease brush by beauty junkies but
Sigma has one that's exactly the same I
forgot which one dub says no pick in and
out what's sibling brush from Elle puts
up with that on the sibling brush from
ELF we talked about that that's okay
I'll say again this is the sibling brush
from ELF this is amazing for cream blush
cream blush yeah we've talked about a
lot today it's easy to miss stuff so
easy Jody says I like lip brushes for
applying concealer around the lips if
you need to clean things up really smart
Jody Seay I need to get one now now I
feel like I need to get one step says I
go on Amazon get a pack of disposable
doe foot applicator problem solved nice
true beauty says the Sigma e-40 mark
says gem what palettes you recommend
that's not crazy in price it just it
just kind of depends on what you're
looking for it's hard to just say let's
recommend a palette because I don't know
what you're looking for affinity for a
neutral palette the Coastal Scents
revealed palettes are nice the original
one and smoky one probably and else the
four that's the the three pan one elf
ones are really nice oh yes Oh wet and
wild wet and wild not else sorry
not else rewind rewind not elf wet and
wild know what I'm thinking when wild
Christmas says I walked away I thought
you were saying sibling brush from elf
brush it's so funny yes not elf wet
miles you can get Coastal Scents on
their website but if you want with
something the drugstore go get the wet
and wild trios they're really good
overall can you use this for foundation
I wouldn't use this this small one for a
foundation if you're going to use a
stippling brush for foundation you want
one that's bigger and I don't think I
have one that's a good representation
because I don't personally have the time
or patience to step on my foundation on
and then blend it I just I don't this is
the small stipple brush there's a big
stipple brush too though yes
I've has a stipple travel set yes they
do yes and that's a good one if you want
to try a sibling brushes to get the out
point
they are nice they're very nice Jody
says if you live in Canada winners also
usually has some Ecotools brush that's
great to know Jody thank you because I
don't know that's not because I'm not in
Canada super quiche says thoughts on it
cosmetics brushes I always see them in
Ulta but I don't hear about them it
cosmetics brushes are really really nice
I had one of their really big brushes
and it broke on me and I was really
really sad the handle the ferrule came
off with the handle but they're so
expensive I don't really buy them often
because they are expensive but they are
really really nice I buy them as gifts
for people so best brush for the outer V
color for packing it in I would use a
pencil brush for for getting it in there
I really like pencil brushes for that
and then blending it out with something
fluffy like this so bronzer brushes this
or anything that you use for blush so
like this can be used for bronzer I
don't know I wouldn't tell you I
personally wouldn't use this for bronzer
I don't cuz I would want something a
little bit lighter the stippling brushes
are really nice for for bronzer because
you don't you don't know a whole lot of
bronzer like I don't know where's what
happen to haunt us again this is the
brushes like this can be good for
bronzer what happened to my oh this one
right here this is good for bronzer see
how it's like stippling looking so you
don't will get a whole lot of product on
it so that's really nice
Barbara says duct tape to fix the handle
you know where were you Barbara before
through that brush away where were you
with this genius idea to use duct tape
like what's why didn't I do that I don't
know I guess I had too much pride to put
duct tape on my Terrace I think Alana's
good eye brushes including outer-v nice
and the DIY Beauty says when you act
like you're having a one-on-one combo
not at the computer screen yes yes brush
cleaners um brush cleaners you know
there's so many expensive brush cleaners
when really honestly I use baby shampoo
like dollar-store baby shampoo for the
longest time and that worked fine um you
know so I mean really you don't need it
a whole lot I did get me new they sent
me the new Sigma it's not by Sigma I
forget what the brand is but it's a
brand that's affiliated with Sigma
it's like a new Sigma brand where it's
like a pad that you put on your hand and
you brush your brushes on it I should
have brought it up saying it was gonna
do brushes brush video but I want to do
a review on that I didn't tell them I
was gonna do a review but I do want to
do a review because I think that would
be a good video yes can you send me a
sample of your brush cleanser kandi what
where do you sell your brush cleanser so
that I can I can shout it out in case
anybody wants to buy it or check it out
gorilla glue is awesome critical it was
also my showed you scrilla glue one a
four throw it away
Kristin game says I swear by the bench
about brush shampoo balm yes the bench
of L is really really nice yes I really
like that one - absolutely absolutely
Michelle says once you clean them wipe
the handles down with alcohol to get the
build-up goo off nice that's awesome how
much our beauty junkie brushes and where
do you get them beauty junkie brushes
are inexpensive I can't remember the
exact price used Kristin was it one
Kristin or Kristin one one Kristin I
think it was what it was for your
discount
Kri STI and and then if you can get them
on Amazon it just has been beauty
junkies or they Joe a beauty junkies
website but the Kristen's code might
only work on Amazon so yes definitely
and I missed it candy if you told me the
name of where you sell them or you don't
sell them not selling them yet still
being mastered nice nice yeah I
definitely try it out mark says Jen what
is exactly is a creasing that bad
foundation does I don't understand its
when if you don't have any wrinkles it's
not going to make any difference because
my creasing is when when foundation goes
into wrinkles so a little crease almost
like you think about a piece of paper
creasing it'll kind of sink in and
accentuate fine lines and wrinkles I
think is what what you're talking about
candy says check my youtube channel for
updates nice Natalie says I use a brush
back by freedom makeup London and I
swear by it nice alright guys I'm gonna
go ahead and pop off here I'm gonna go
