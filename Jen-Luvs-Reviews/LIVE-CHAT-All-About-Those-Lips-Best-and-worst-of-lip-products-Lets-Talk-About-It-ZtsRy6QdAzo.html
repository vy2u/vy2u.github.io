it I took some dayquil and we're pushing
through let's add some lip stuff so lip
stuff let me just tell you a little
history
me and lips all right I avoided doing
anything with my lips of the lip balm
because lips scare me like doing too
bold of a lip freaks me out like I feel
like people are gonna look at me like
what in the world is going on there so
it's taking me a lot of time to get some
confidence in actually putting a
brighter color on my lips it's taking a
really long time to figure out how to do
what what colors look best on me and now
finally I'm feeling a bit more confident
partially thanks to Sandra and and yeah
so now I own a lot of lip products I
pulled out all of my lip products so
that we can go ahead and chat about all
the different things your screen is
green what that's weird Nicki cave up
caring um yeah I mean oh no you can hear
me but you can't see me hit try to hit
refresh dance oh hello Tabitha is this
doing the post twice thing I hope not
Tabitha hopefully it's just posting once
that's what I'm hoping we shall see
alright so let's talk about lip stuff so
where I started was with the better than
the lick my lips but better color so I'm
going to show you some of my favorite my
lips but better colors I have the
microphone here in my lap so I'm going
to try not to drop it that's the goal so
some of my favorite my lips but better
colors where did my 1 go that I
definitely wanted to show you I pulled
it out specifically own up here's one
here's to um well let's just start with
these let's just start with these two so
if you have never discovered the Revlon
kissable balm stains and all of these
things they are so fabulous like they're
really really nice i'm sorry i just saw
I hope there's no problems with viewing
this so on us again okay
okay all right anyway so these things
are so amazing this happens to be a
matte balm in the shade elusive yes
elusive we wouldn't watch that for you
it is so fabulous like it is just a
beautiful beautiful shape this one's a
little bit pink for me but I really
really like it a lot the other one I
really like a lot I believe is called
honey and it's from the original it's
from the original line of kissable balm
stains that thing is amazing such a
wonderful wonderful shade for high end
this Marc Jacobs shade and eat cake is
really beautiful for me go ahead and
show you that I got a couple old
swatches that don't come off this one is
beautiful as well I really love that one
a lot ironically i'm not wearing lip
products today I'm not wearing any
makeup yet I just got it a bed not that
long ago so you know we're rolling with
it this is another one from the
drugstore that's amazing it's called
airy-fairy by Rimmel this one's a
beautiful beautiful shade for my lips
but better I would love to know what you
guys think as far as as we'll talk about
it okay I would love to know what you
guys think about what your favorite my
lips but better shades or it will be
awesome to hear what you guys think
about that I think those of you that are
concerned about the double posting thing
I think it's when I create the event
that everybody gets a notification and
then when it goes live it you get
another notification I don't believe
it's actually posting twice I think it's
just two notifications that's my guess
about a half an hour goes when I created
the event so let's go back to lip
products nikki says she loves two-faced
spice spice baby that is one that i do
not own um I Oh naughty nude for nude
urnu dear ones I know naked dahling on
naked dolly is a little bit too pale for
me maybe someone with a lighter skin
tone would be able to pull this one off
as on my lips but better but this one is
way too light for me personally and the
thing about my lips but better to is it
really just depends a lot on what your
skin tone is because if you have a deep
skin tone these are not my lips but
better on you these are
so this is just my recommendations from
my skin tone I I only have one skin
tones oh and um you know I'd only
recommend for me let's say I'm reading
some comments here Robin says she loves
Maybelline's lust for blush that's a
really good one is her lips but better
shade I would love to hear from someone
from a deep with a deep skin tone to see
what you love mini me she says she loves
wet and wild bear at all she is a medium
skin tone she loves that one this is one
that's good this one is two-faced
naughty nude this one is a little light
for me for my lips but better but it is
a really nice shape I really like that
one a lot another good one that's kind
of a classic is Nora's dolce vita I'm
going to be all swatched out by the end
of this video nars is dolce vita is very
sheared the phone just be aware that
it's very sheer Flavio says Urban
Decay's fiend is her favorite um I do
not know that one but that sounds
amazing I do like the Urban Decay
lipsticks quite a bit alright let's see
if they say there's any other before we
move on to another topic let's see if
there's any other ones let's see Vicki
says she heard light skin tones she
likes Max's fo Mac Mac's Mac from Mac
the shade fo we're just going to say it
like that um and yeah Nicki says she's
sitting here making a list I'm reading
you the chat window that's over on the
side of my screen because if you're
watching this pre-recorded you're not
gonna be able to see what everyone's
saying so I'm running it back to you
nikki says she's sitting making a list
which is what i'm going to do once i
watch this replay emre moss wants to
know um she said Jenna off topic but
I'll forget if I don't mention it now
okay I'll wait for you Kiki says I just
passed by to say hi I'm leaving for
church now hoping it was a blast day no
Kiki don't go tell me your button lips
but better shape what's your favorite
lips will better shave before you leave
machines like a little bit deeper of a
skin tone um let's see Flavio says to
face spice spice baby is amazing many me
she also says oprah's pasadena is a good
one / really makes a wonderful lip
products if you don't know the Brant
Oprah they're really
pretty fab on Akane and says she doesn't
have one but she loves cream caught by
Mack on her lips she is a lighter skin
tone amber Moss says she found in Duke
for Urban Decay's 1993 let me know what
it is Amber Lee says she recently tried
steel is patina and it's a beautiful my
lips but better shade for me and then
sandras says don't think I owning your
lips but better shade LOL because Sandra
wears bright crazy lips she's amazing
that's her thing she's got these
beautiful lips and she just shows them
off alright so let's go ahead and move
on from my lips but better and let's go
ahead and talk about what should we talk
about should we talk about formulas or
should we talk about drug sir she talked
about high-end she talked about liquid
lipsticks what should we do um Nikki
also agrees that patina is good hello
Krista from oh oh my monthly obsessions
calm so good to see you I'm so glad that
you're here she said she almost forgot
about it alright let's see what else can
we talk about let's talk about some
liquid lipsticks formulas it sends twice
because the first one is the
announcement that i did a little earlier
that i normally do the fur is wondering
why he got the video twice it's because
i started the the chat early i made the
announcement the chat was coming early
so that's why it sent twice but it won't
post twice I don't think it will you
guys have to give more details on that
later Sandra says go read or go back to
bed I was not around says ionio
drugstore lippies is a really better
formulas and high-end they're so
expensive that's a great question
personally I feel like there can be I
think there are some really great
drugstore lipsticks out there but I feel
like with drugstore lipstick they tend
to get hard and dry faster in high-end
lipsticks that's just my personal
opinion I also sometimes they're more
likely to have that lipstick smell then
the the higher-end lipsticks so I do
feel like there is a formula difference
in lipstick swear I feel like with
mascaras you get just the same thing I
was reading on the what's gonna make up
app someone was raving in the review
section about the Jordana best / extreme
mascara and how amazing it is telling
you that mascaras four dollars is just
as good as every small hi ms tara that I
own but anyway my point is back to lips
that I really do feel like there's a
difference between a lot of high-end
lipsticks and drugstore lipsticks um let
me say okay here we go so Kiki says bear
all by wet and wild color pops Bieber
mixed with MIDI she is of a um like a
deeper skin though I'm not super deep
but like kind of deep ish deepesh I
don't know how you describe you know
shades of deep um let's see amber says
is not mad but spot on otherwise
maybelline colorsensational touchable
taupe she really likes and she looks
like she is of like my skin tone maybe
Lily says hello hello to Lily good
morning flory well avail comments were
unavailable to me for the first 15
minutes so weird dan says I have a
question I'm a male and need to get some
lipstick foreplay I'm doing because I'm
playing the female character any
recommendations it will really depend on
your skin tone a lot of the shades we've
already talked about would be great for
you um so definitely check those out you
want to go for more of a matte finish
who's that shiny finish may look a
little weird so anything that says matt
finish would probably be good for you
amber says I power it powder it to make
it mad and that's something you can
definitely do gold digger says finally
got into chat good morning yeah there
seems like be a lot of people having
trouble getting into chat this morning
you were not the only one Ashley says
hello hello to Ashley and then many me
she says she loves what and wilds bear
at all compared to max velvet teddy it
just doesn't last as long viva la juicy
03 good morning to you it's okay oh
there's a lot of people that are having
trouble getting in this one let's go
ahead and talk about some liquid
lipsticks we just talked about all your
lips but better so mad some liquid
lipsticks hello Amy um Okeke also says
she loves the love love I'm shade w5 in
l'oreal i miss i'm not quite getting the
progression there but i'm sure people
can decode that Sandra says max twig
let's see
all right saturday list i buy some
liquid lipstick so the first formula i
want to talk about the toothpaste melted
liquefied long wearing lipsticks these
are a very strange for me it's a really
weird formula for me they they come out
of this little puffy thing here this is
where the product comes out and it ends
drying pretty matte in my opinion um
there's and it lasts for a while but
then it starts crackling off my lips and
drying I don't know if anybody else has
the same problem with these but I don't
like the way they where I usually feel
like I need a lip balm in order to get
these to work but I really am NOT the
biggest fan of this formula I got one of
the melted metal ones and those I did
not I liked him a lot at first the one
that I got I got them melted um it's the
Coralie one I can't remember it off the
top of my head let me see if I have it
here if I somewhere else you know I
think it's in my purse but I tried it
and I just I'm not feeling it anymore
it's the crackling really bothers me
Amy's talking about the Gemini Holograms
lipstick that just came out onto for his
website that thing is so gorgeous but
there's no way that I would ever wear
that color it's insane 8 Anya says she
doesn't like the two face on Akane Oh
says to face melted lippies they end up
on her teeth yuck definitely Cristo
check out my monthly obsessions calm for
her website nikki says to face melted
are not long wearing but I love them
still she lets fig in Chihuahua the
thing that freaks me out is it's called
melted Chihuahua and just the visual on
that is totally disturbing to me like I
can't even take a visual a melted to our
like it's just something just inherently
wrong about that that lipstick name I
just can't even take it but this formula
is definitely not my favorite um I feel
like they last pretty well but they
flake off you know oh my goodness
tabatha says that the gem lipstick is
already out of stock that's crazy I'm
not surprised but it's crazy and you
know it won't be back when support runs
out of stuff they don't it don't come
back Kiki says I love those OMG i have
like seven shades they're amazing my
favorite colors sand and peony she
talking about being bright colors also
the bright colors before I where I prep
my lip with bomb because it's drying yes
I think that's a smart way to wear these
with bomb underneath nikki says she has
the same experiences what I said about
me about the crackling nests and then
Anya says it's animal cruelty I think
these are cruelty-free the two face
products are cruelty-free lisa says they
should have thought they should have
thought that through yeah I mean I think
that you and you get a formula I can't
even imagine how hard it is develop a
lipstick formula like I can't even
imagine there's a lot of things to
consider a lot of things and let's see
okay favorite liquid lipstick Ashley
says that's a great segue into my
favorite liquid lipstick my favorite
formulas I have to favor formulas and
this is the thing is I don't I'll tell
you this ahead of time I don't mind the
drying pneus of a liquid lipstick it
doesn't bother me as long as it doesn't
flake off and it starts flaking off
you've lost me like that that's where
you lose me so um Oh Leslie's talking
about pink chocolate from two faces one
of my favorite lipsticks all right I'm
gonna ignore the chat for just a second
and tell you about my favorite liquid
lipsticks so much i'm trying to stay
focused here so i do really love the kat
von d liquid lipsticks i really like
this formula a lot but there is a
formula that I honestly like better and
people are probably going to be like why
and that is the colour-pop formula i
genuinely like the color pop folio the
best out of all the liquid lipstick
formulas that i've tried now I've seen
reviews of the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks for they talk about how the
formulas very inconsistent I must just
gotten just very lucky in the ones that
I've gotten because for me the flooding
has not been inconsistent it's been
pretty awesome um and again the ultra
maps that's exactly one that they're
pretty amazing for me I'll tell you
which ones that I own hopefully this is
all of them i don't believe that it is I
you know I leave things around places
elite things around places and then you
know things happen to stuff oh let's see
oh here's some more here we go I failed
him hold on I just dropped watch just a
second
all right Pullman pull microphone back
up because last couple weeks ago out for
my microphone back up and it sounded
like you do ok so these are the ones
that I have and you can see that there's
a trend in the shades I kind of stepped
out of my comfort zone and two of them
but other than that they're essentially
from the same family so let's talk about
the ones that i have that are loud and
obnoxious and awesome and then we'll
talk about the ones that are typical for
me all right stay stay I tell you okay
so here we go so these two I have Ouija
and I have drive-in I have never worn
driving and I should a misa do I have a
p.o box I have a address that is on my
um it's on my page my YouTube page my
about me page but it's not right I have
to update it it's my husband's tattoo
studio address but it's the wrong
address we just with the shot well let
me do this let's do this let's put it
here so here's Ouija bright and crazy
but it looks gorgeous I do have some
videos where I wore this and you'll see
it glowing from the thumbnail like
totally see it glowing I hear that some
people are saying kat von z color pop
and stila are her favorites from Oregon
yeah the Cielo I like but I don't like
their color range they need a better
color range many more wearable colors
for me like ones that I can wear to work
so that one here is driving again I've
never worn that one because it freaks me
out but I want to step out of my comfort
zone and wear it and we'll show you a
couple more these are the ones that are
more me this one's beeper I wear this
for filming all the time and I love it a
little bit love it here's paper it's
just that gorgeous brown and this was
the one that Kiki was talking about was
a good little your lips but better for
her mixed with MIDI which I don't own
but I really love that one that one go
really goes very well with the whole
brown lip trend it's going it's really
fits well with that this one is called
coolest this one came from their second
set of liquid lipsticks they released
and then once got some brown undertones
to it but it's not super brown let's see
let's go to the next one this one here
is call
bumble this ones are really nice when
this was my first one that I fell in
love with was bumble it's more of a
reddish toned brownish kind of color
it's almost on the edge of brick red but
it's got some brown in there but it's
not too loud for me people would you see
three says if you ever try the NYX soft
matte lip creams if you have I would
like your opinion about soft matte lip
creams in just a second this is Sol oh
this is another one or solo however you
want to say it that i absolutely love
love that one that one is definitely on
my lips but better one this one this top
one is called Ouija if someone was
wanting to know I think Lisa was wanting
to know that one I think I think that's
the one you're talking about Lisa and
then this one here is called toll and
this is another beautiful one it's kind
of similar to the one up here but this
one is a little bit more red tone so
those are all the colour-pop ones that I
have and again I really love this
formula I can't help it um I can't help
it I know that there are people that
don't like it but I love it now the
thing is is one thing that I really want
to stress about these though is that we
carry a lip balm in your pocket because
it will help when you put it on it will
kind of kill the matte effect but it'll
help it wear evenly because they do kind
of tend to wear off a little weird so
but if you throw a bomb on it just
smooths it all out beautifully another
thing I love about these is that they're
so stinking opaque fourth one down one
two three four that one was clueless
fourth one down is clueless um but um
excuse me but um but yeah I mean I they
what was he saying oh they wear off a
little funky so you just got to wear it
put on lip balm and it smooths out and
then I was saying that they're very okay
so if I had any luck likes like spots
where my lips are like dry or like their
little red or whatever in little spots
if I put these on it's covered
completely same thing with the kat von d
covered completely 610 123456 this one
was a solo or saulo but yes I love love
love this formula so let's go ahead and
talk about the NYX soft matte lip creams
I have some of those and
here's one NYX soft matte lip creams
okay well I found one i know i have lots
more here we go here's a couple more
soft matte lip creams i have these in
this is ibiza i believe i don't have to
say that I'm sorry Antwerp and Zurich
these are the shades that I own I do not
like this formula it goes on Patchi for
me I don't enjoy it Oh compared to these
where they don't go on Patchi these go
on super patchy for me and I don't I
don't like them at all now Anna Connie
is talking about the Knicks Suede's she
says they're not worth it it won't dry
and this is the thing about the Knicks
Wade's I do have some mix Wade's talk
about those where I'm in Nick's waves I
know I have some in here hold on a
minute where my next waves here well no
that's not one hold up oh here we go
here my Suede's okay here the Knicks
Wade's that I own I own let's see if
they have them on the names of life's a
beach soft spoken and tea and cookies
those are the ones that I own these go
on very very nicely but just like Annie
said they don't dry they stay sticky
which is very uncomfortable to wear but
they're beautiful they're opaque but I
don't I really don't like that they stay
tacky it's not enjoyable to wear so you
can top these with a bomb and it kind of
cuts down the tackiness a bit but again
they never completely dry so if you're
aware of that and you're okay with that
you probably will like these but I
personally do not enjoy these at all as
far as that because it just bothers me
absolutely to Viva La Juicy no problem
um let's say well Sandra says she fully
it's your lips two times a day with her
clarisonic she doesn't know it work for
anyone else but I feel it makes your
lips off that is very interesting
because I have issues with my lips never
being completely exfoliate like I always
have issues with my lips that's a great
idea Sandra thank you for that tip nikki
says yeah I suede in vintage getting my
name's messed up I have too many
lipsticks haha people of GC says anyone
have
opinions on the NYX butter glosses yes
the butter glosses are one of my
favorite if not my favorite lip formula
I absolutely love the NYX butter glosses
my friend who lives I have a friend who
lives in Barbados that I met through the
app keek a while back she still watches
my video she's amazing her name's
Lucinda and she always laughs because
they got the NYX butter glosses in
Barbados and she had to get them because
i raved about them so much in videos and
every time I talk about the next butter
gloss so she's like all man here goes
jammed with the butter glosses again I
actually love the NYX butter glosses uh
let me see if I have one right here I do
have one here now NYX butter glosses
they are glosses though Krista yes I can
see your post sweetheart I just can't
I'm not reading every single one over on
the side because I'm trying to talk and
sing functional at the same time taba
this time that the elf lip exfoliator
which is also amazing it's really really
good um Amy says she's looking at the
blue and green lipsticks at color pop
there's no way there's no way I'm not
buying one it's it's not me I there's no
way I would wear a blue lipstick unless
it's Halloween then i would but let's
talk about the butter glosses so this is
the butter gloss an apple strudel it is
a gloss I mean you can see it's like it
glosses out but it has some color to it
so this is really nice for people that
are just starting in lip color that well
don't want something that super opaque
want to have a nice shine on their lips
they smell amazing they smell very very
sweet if you don't like scented stuff
you're not going to like them but I
really really like the butter glosses
they stay on a nice time for gloss and I
do enjoy them alessandra I wanted to
find it says I feel like the color pop
gave me huge allergic reactions someone
got that like the ultra dry peeling lips
I've heard that Alexander from some
people that they do have the ultra dry
does give them like a reaction I have
heard that from people i have not had
that personal experience with it I've
heard it from one other person just one
but that that it happens one person it
can happen to another person so yeah but
they are very inexpensive so at least
you're not out a whole lot of money I
hope gene says does anyone have Nicole
Guerrero's lip mask from best on beauty
i do not have that yeah flory i agree
cheer on Amy and getting those crazy lip
colors we get some coffee real quick
whoo young I'm just talking my face off
over here all right okay Krista says she
likes the intense butter glosses but
they will get everywhere yeah I mean you
have to apply them but it could excuse
me oh my goodness i'm falling apart here
um yeah i mean i think the deeper shades
i think are a little trickier to work
with just because you know with lighter
shades it's easy to cut i'll put them on
and you don't really notice that they go
out of place a bit but many me she says
the intense butter glosses are amazing
too especially the tray leche that's her
favorite very cool um a nice time at the
color pops were bad i'm wondering what
she didn't like about them Amy evil
ahjussi says gen'l'men seventh grade and
i want to attempted lip gloss to just
throw on so i'll probably try to it's a
really good one it's definitely i
totally if you're going to school this
is these are definitely a wonderful
formula for you absolutely absolutely um
let's see minegishi okay whatever the
harry potter mug yes this is my this is
my favorite part of harry potter of all
parts of harry potter was the marauders
map it just is this the concept of the
marauders map is just so stinkin cool
like i wanta marauders map it says the
marauders map on the stuff you know what
i'm talking about it's it's a harry
potter thing and it says i solemnly
swear that i'm up to no good that's how
you activate the map but it's the sole
reason why book to raise my favorite um
but anyway moving on and he says she
wears blue and purple on your lips go
for girlfriend I can't do it I can't do
it um let's say Jean says trail a che is
definitely a great shade Florrie says
she was rocking the purple lip I have
you rock it very well I see flurry on
the app with her purple lip all the time
it looks amazing let's say okay yes yes
it's my fave okay before we move on I do
have some other liquid lipstick formulas
that I wanted to speak about these are
the honest songs yall beverly hills
liquid lipsticks these were not my
favorites i did not enjoy these the
range just like the see loved ones is
not super good for me personally I feel
like they don't have any good like like
these like these color woods how
many good shades like that that I could
get a lot of them were sold out when I
tried to get them I think there's only
like one or two they just don't have a
good color range and the formula is
there a flaky on me it's drying it's
flaky it just doesn't work even with a
lip gloss over top or a lip balm over
tomm a still we're terribly on me and I
cannot stand them like I just I'm not I
guess anastasi Beverly Hills like I'm
not trying to knock the brand love the
almond bread products but i'm not a fan
of their liquid lipsticks at all these
did not work for me i have did i say
what shades i have i have spicy and i
have retro coral and i've worn these for
filming before and then worn them for
the rest of the day i tried to wear this
would work and it did not work for me
excuse me another brand that i want to
talk about is Oprah if you don't know
ofra i met mr. ofra at the generation
beauty and he was awesome and he said
that he was the one four or five years
ago to invent the first liquid lipstick
these are these really are amazing
liquid lipsticks this one is in the
shade Angeles it's a little bit of a
freaky shade it's very very light but
what I like to do with this one is I
like to top this over shades that are
too dark for me like let me put this
over top of here and show you how it
transforms it just makes it a really
interesting shade did you see that so I
use this to transform other shades let
me put it over the other one of course
I'm ruining my swatches for future
reference but watch what happens to it
when I put that over top in that kool so
this is the onus if they should just
call this the transformative liquid
lipstick the shade in Angeles um it's
it's magical it's magical to me I I love
this thing it's actually getting old I
need to purchase another one and I this
was the first Oh for a liquid lipstick I
ever got and I absolutely love it it's
got it like a moosey texture to it and
it's not drying it's not moisturizing
but it's not drying it doesn't it
doesn't last as long as some of the
other liquid lipsticks that I own but it
really is nice come on
smell it smells like straight-up cake
like take like vanilla cake um but yeah
let me put the swatches next to it ivy
so you can see the original shades and
how it transforms them put a little dot
here so it's almost like what I have
this is almost like having a whole
nother set of liquid lipsticks yeah you
see the difference in that cool so cool
so cool but anyway I'd Emily could not
leave the slit this lip video without
talking about the oprah liquid lipsticks
tooth that oh okay i'm nikki says it
that oprah is uh is doing a collab with
deep that two highlighters ooh very nice
very nice cool man I do love Oprah
another one that phone line that I
wanted to talk about before we move on
is the show off lip lacquers by Rimmel
um these again are not my favorite they
flake off on me and I don't know why and
makes me want to cry like I just they're
not enjoyable to wear and if I remember
right Evan worn it in a while remember I
they smell bad too yeah they smell
terrible they smell horrible it's not a
lipstick smell but it's like a real
makeup be nasty smell these are
definitely not my favorites when they
first came out I know there was a lot of
hype about how amazing these are but I
don't I don't enjoy them I have the
shade I three of them obviously I have
meteor meet meteoric meteor that Aurora
and then I have this one doesn't have
the shade on it anymore accidentally
ripped it off but it's the new be one
but yeah these are not my favorites I
don't like these at all some other ones
that I just want to talk about before
you move on from liquid lipsticks the
Sephora brands are amazing I really
really love excuse me I really love the
Sephora brand liquid lipsticks also the
this brand right here this is mirren s
really like their liquid lipsticks and
then the LA girl matte ones they're just
okay for me I'm not um not the biggest
fan of these um they're they're fine but
they're very very very very very drying
and just it's as flat finish putting the
gloss and they are very very flat and
very very very dry
and I don't know not the hugest fan not
the hugest fan let me see if there's any
other formulas I haven't talked about I
have a bunch of these Jake at beauty
wonder lip paints these are messy but
they're beautiful they're very opaque
they're really messy really really messy
I don't own any of the occ lip tars
they're just the same packaging they're
not the same occ lip tars are a lot more
opaque anic aayah says the Galactic dose
of colors are supposed to be the best
formulas ever anyone confirms I haven't
tried a but wanted to I haven't ever
tried those um does a college is very
expensive I'm gotten anyone knows the
colors let's do a Spencer for me past my
price point the last one I actually I
want to talk about these because these
were very popular for a while um where
the glaze lip paid spy la girl I wasn't
a big fan of these either um these are
extremely opaque they may my eye I guess
it's just the shade the shade just
wasn't very wearable for me and I did
have that dry flaky anything happening
with this just mmm not my favorite not
my favorite so that's kind of where I'm
going with liquid lipsticks did I miss
any is there anything else we want to
talk about before we move on Jean says I
can never get the sport liquid lipsticks
are always sold out by me they are a
really nice formula it's a foreign brand
I think people judge Sephora brand
because ulta brand is known to be not so
hot mount such a great brand it's a
former it actually makes some really
good stuff but they also make some
really bad stuff so it's really hard to
decide what to get from Sephora brand
there are shadows are extremely and
inconsistent their lip products are
inconsistent but I do really like their
matte liquid lipsticks Krista says
Joseph Kony has hands down her favorite
and they're expensive but they last they
don't crumble and she can eat oily salad
dressing and they still stay that's
amazing nikki says youtuber Stephanie
Nicole who is also all reviews all of
the lipsticks are very detailed check-in
times and she buys her own and nothing
PR yes I'm gonna check out youtube
channel stephanie nicole definitely
recommend that one Nikki thank you so
much for mentioning her she's amazing
people of juicy 3 have you ever tried
both the Revlon lip butters and
Maybelline Color whispers if so which do
you prefer nice transition into the next
topic
maybelline color whispers i do have some
of those where my color whispers okay
here are these are the pop bombs the
l'oreal pop bombs here is enabling color
whisper this one is in a pinup peach
which is a very popular shade let's see
if I can let's switch arms here can I do
left-handed swatches will say all right
this is pinup peach this is up my lips
but better kind of shade they're very
they're not opaque the ones that I own
they're not opaque they're they're quite
sheer but they're nice they're nice they
definitely give you some solid color
where time is typical moisturizing is
pretty nice but not you know not super
moisturizing um but where time is not
super long no scent no sense I'm reading
the comments over here those of college
I thought they were more expensive than
$18 for some reason nikki says she
doesn't like the color whispers but only
because they're so sheer yeah I mean you
can see the difference between some of
the things I was watching over here and
the this one you know it's definitely
sheer what was this one yeah what that
was oh that was a nude lipstick by
toothpaste but that one specifically
nude anyway oh and then this was dolce
vita by NARS so that's sheer like that
it is they are quite sheer well they're
nice they're nice especially if you're
looking for something that is a little
less opaque alessandra says Alexandra
excuse me good morning Jen flower
Cosmetics has a nice sheer lip formula
that's what you know I've never tried
Alexandria great suggestion oh we're
talking about Leslie okay oh they're all
talking about double posting okay only
seen comments once I don't know what is
going on with youtube today as far as
the chat would know and everything
coming up hopefully everything went okay
as far as the move all grunt nerded out
that the booth at Tabitha's says I like
the color whispers woods impossible find
one that someone hasn't used as a tester
yeah that's kind of a noise oh yeah
uh-huh uh-huh what was the other formula
we were talking about it was it wasn't
just those you guys want to know about
out something else oh I want to talk
about these these are the Maybelline
what are these things called the elixirs
I thought I like these and I realized
that it's basically plastic for your
lips I don't like them anymore oh maybe
she's leaving bye don't forget to go to
mini me she's channel she's got a
wonderful youtube channel go check her
out um maybelline mats are also amazing
she wanted to say she has to go these
these smell like straight up like
flavored classic and they they go on so
incredibly pouchy I thought they were
going to be more like liquid lipsticks
but they're heavy and thick and they
smell terrible and they're just in my
opinion I do not enjoy these at all in
case you didn't notice they've got the
soft warm though that's the thing that
sucked me and made me think I liked it
because this wand is so cushy it feels
like it's giving your lips like this
nice little beautiful little hug and
then it hit you with the smell and
stickiness and the Blair and look mmhmm
yeah I don't enjoy these case you didn't
notice I don't enjoy them I don't know
why I still have these things when I
don't enjoy things why do I keep them so
that I can tell you that I don't enjoy
them that's why I keep them um let's see
this was open a minute like that here's
another one this one is in I don't know
the number it's number three hundred
sixty i think five no 895 i flip it over
this is another one I can't see what the
shade is because it's rubbed off at this
point but it's just they're very um
they're glossy they're not um they're
like trying to be not trying to be but
they're in the same family as the NYX
butter gloss is but they're not nearly
as good because they're heavy and thick
and sticky let's see Shannon says she
loves the Urban Decay Clausen liar it's
quite opaque smells good and the perfect
your lips better for pale girls awesome
dad says provocative mmm that's an
interesting name I don't know that one
meaning me she says loves the high
voltage oh okay awesome very cool and
then um I think it's having this is
what's the deal with lipsticks smelling
weird it must be something in the
formula because different brands
all smell like that lipstick smell like
how do you get that lipsticks now what's
the ingredient it smells like the
lipstick smell it's in so many lipstick
I don't even know Oh Leslie I'm sorry
well at least you'll get to watch it on
replay if you want to you can you can
fast forward if you want to all right so
let's go ahead and start talking about I
have a bunch of these I talked about
your lips but better with these check
things oh no my battery's running low
okay this is what I gotta do okay i
didn't realize i forgot to plug in my
computer so if anybody comes in tell
them i'm going to get my charger and
I'll be right back if you're watching
this on replay just fast forward until
you see me come back so hold on a second
and my computer will die okay coming
back we just plug this in real quick I
forgot to plug it in hold on hold on
almost there plugging in because I do
not want this to die that would be
terrible all right okay let's check in
on my framing real quick and just make
sure I'm looking okay yep we're still
looking at pet hair is looking okay
eyebrows are non-existent all right I
just got lip gloss all in my hair okay I
know thank you thank you for the music
the have this gold lalalalala hold on
music I know when we need to like some
elevator music exactly maybe a juicy
absolutely um all right I wanted to talk
a little bit about formulas I'm all
these stick formulas of lip products
things these sticky thingies and which
ones are my favorites and which ones are
your favorites all these sticky things
there's so many of them why do I own so
many I don't know what is the purpose of
all these
why do they exist in my life I don't
even know alright so let's start off
with color pop I could tell you the
color pop is I don't I can't even I I
hate that I'm saying this because i feel
like it sounds them sponsored but i'm
not hashtag not sponsored where staff um
I love the colour-pop lippie Stix I
absolutely love them I am NOT the
biggest fan of their eyeshadows and
there there are bronzers but I love
their highlighters I love their blushes
and I love their lip products are
they're just amazing they're really
there moisturizing you don't have a
super long-lasting power I mean it's
pretty good for a lipstick formula but
they're they're really nice I really
liked them a lot missing oh I may be
saying she loves the clinic chubby
sticks she doesn't know why I don't know
any of those I really should though so I
have quite a few shades of these i'm not
going to swatch them all but just to
know which ones i have i have burn or
should I swatch something you want me to
swatch them should ice wash them I'm
dropping all my stuff I'm going to put
all this stuff back in yeah I'm just
kind of dropping it all on the floor
that's not gonna be good either cuz my
language is not big enough for my lip
products you get all my color coffee I
guess I can splash them real quick Oh
Cathy it was nice to meet you too she
likes camp caught them at cosmetics lip
labas those are the ones that person
game worked with was camp cosmetics I
don't know any of those Christmases she
loves color pops looking lippie Stix
they're amazing color selection is
awesome that's a very true people
ahjussi want to just watch them all
right we're going to swatch them okay
these are the ones that i have i have
these here will swatch them on this arm
this one is called juice bar and now if
I'd ever worn this one I think I have I
have let's put them let's put them on
the inside just like we did with the
other ones so that is juice bar and it's
just the kind of a bright bright purpley
pink okay and then we'll do this one is
called I heart this and this line oh
I've never worn I don't know why I've
never worn well that's why because it's
ridiculously opaque and bright and they
scare me they still scare me I try to
have them not scare me Sandra but they
do scare me so juice bar is a little
more sheer you can see the difference
between the two business juice bar and
this is I heart this this is definitely
a little more sheer this one is
considered a mat I heart this and then
this one is considered a sheer it's
called shear so they tell you that
before you buy it nikki says she only
has tiger and it's really pretty and
then this one here is called fern and
it's a cream I try to get when i buy
things for review i try to get things
that are different formula so you guys
can see the different formulas i think
i've learned friend once and i really
liked it a lot when it was out of my out
of my comfort zone colour-pop lippie s
have good stain for a lip for a regular
lipstick formula I feel like they have
good stain but they're not like this if
you want something to last forever you
want to get the liquid lipsticks these
will last a long time but it's not like
it's not like these it's not like these
these will be only for the next three
days look even if I scrub my arm they'll
be on me in the next few days same thing
with a cat Marv need liquid lipsticks
alright this one is one I wear a lot of
Cola mirror and it was the it's the
kathleenlights one and I personally
really like live here I know I've heard
some people don't like linear I like I
think it's a beautiful shape as on the
new kathleenlights it's just a it's a
gorgeous shade and it's just it's a it's
a me shade the shade that I love it's
kind of a purpley mall be kind of color
with a little bit of brown undertones
and this one is a matte finish let's see
um let's age um Alexander says color
pops lbb as a favorite for fall nikki
says she loves the mat in the satin most
and says just do it right let's suit you
all thank you so much dan says when Jen
war we gon scourge asst bright colors
sooner so much aww thank you so much
appreciate that and he says she lives
for Lumiere same with impaired Lumiere
to contempo they look so similar online
I don't have to Temple I what if I could
this is one that I wear all the time
it's called bound this is another one
that's a very nice
aid or you can see like it's like
similar to the knee shades over here
it's just like a creamy pink imam be
kind of color love that one Lumiere is
beautiful edited yeah but with but the
thing is is if it's Matt you just put a
gloss over top and it's not mad anymore
like seriously just put a lip balm over
top just a regular lip balm or lip gloss
whatever you'll be fine Lumiere suppose
to be a Duke Bernards and I don't have
that one sanderstead you have great lips
and you can rock strong color by
completely understand the comfort zone
factor in choosing a color all thank you
so much san jose my cheerleader when it
comes to lip products people did you see
03 so she has bound and she loves it and
then christmas as I definitely refer to
prefer to buy one third of a lipstick
for five dollars in a full size of my
lipstick addicts yes and then Christmas
I she loves bad what's amazing this one
is called Topanga and it's a satin
finish I don't one this one too much I
don't know why it's a beautiful Corley
kind of shade orally orangie reddish
kind of shade really like that one I
don't know why I don't wear it it's very
pretty and then the last one I have here
is called button and this is another
shade that I wore a lot in the
summertime love this one for summer
there you go so that one again is called
button and it is a satin finish so
really love this formula it's fantastic
the smell if there is a scent to it if
you don't like sense of lip products you
won't like these because there is a
scent but to me it's not overpowering
it's a nice subtle scent all right we've
got 10 minutes left what do we want to
talk about for 10 minutes let's see
Shannon says Lumiere's gorgeous but a
good looks so much dark rum me than
other people probably because my skin
tone let me tell you something really
interesting very interesting so wait
where are they where are my mighty you
let's fix it um hold on a minute one on
a minute my bike being lipsticks I had
to have to put things on the floor when
I film okay I think that hopefully this
one's it please be the right one please
be the right one yes okay so let me tell
you something about skin tone and shades
okay it makes a huge huge different and
you said yeah if you're still here she
she and i went to the bike
labs in New York City and when we went
there we what it basically what they do
there is a design a lipstick for you I
have a video coming out of our
experience there where they take a color
they say well where do you want to start
what kind of car you looking for and
they slap a color down and then they
start mixing other colors in and trying
different shades until you come up with
your perfect lip shape so this one right
here is one that I made and I this is my
favorite I absolutely love this this is
like gorgeous actually is this the right
one now I think this is the darker one
but anyway point is we hotel nice try to
find the right one because the story is
ruined if I can't find one come on on a
minute it's a little bit lighter one on
where is my lipstick aah I'll find it as
soon as I'm done with you guys I'll find
it ok so anyway let me just tell the
story so point is is that Yesenia is of
a deep like a medium skin tone but it's
like I'm unlike considered medium but
she's like a tan with a like a deep tan
kind of skin tone my last name is cuevas
ok let's just leave it at that so we
tried on the exact same lipstick and I'm
telling you it looked Brown on me it
looked pink on her look straight up pig
and you'll be able to see it in the
video it's crazy so whenever you're
looking for lip swatches please please
please make sure you try to find
something that has your skin tone that's
why I love the color pop website because
they all have they have the the things
are all swatch chocolate proud to swatch
on multiple different skin tones because
they do look quite different on
different skin tones so please please
please when you're looking at swatching
things online and you're looking
swatches look for someone and has a
similar skin tone to you they're
swatches on all different skin tones it
seem like there's more people more
swatches on skin tones that are more
like my skin tone which is sad so jump
on there if you have a deeper skin tone
when you get lit products wash them and
put them online so people can find them
because it really is important to find
your skin tone to see an accurate color
what its gonna look like on you and I
learned that with list with yesenia this
past weekend of how different it looked
on both of us so let's see Annie says
who else is washing on their arms along
with Jedi know right Christmas said
you're giving me
you're getting support give me more lips
am I getting the support give me more
lip set probably not just because I'm
kind of overflowing with lip products
right now and I just did a review on a
lip set so i feel like i can't really
review another one at this point so i
probably won't get this one Stan says
yeah yesenia hats gorgeous latin skin
i'm so envious idiot its year-round tan
line gorgeousness Jane esta Jeanette
Jeanette all right any kind of lip stain
turns my lips bright pink a matter what
color one initial color is we're taught
that is beard I've never heard that
that's queer Lisa said just picked up my
blistex to put on weight false lashes
stuck to the top oh no and he says I
thought the color pop immediately I'm
for julep mint julep her nail polish Oh
as far as the different skin tones yes
julep has the different skin tones for
the nail polishes redhead PhD hello she
says Pinterest is a good place to search
for swatches that are restricted to
english-speaking blog that is really
smart thank you so much for that I
appreciate that exciting would think
about going to pinterest specifically so
look for swatches for things that's
really smart nikki says I really like
the Sephora roots lip stain for just a
really nice lip stain that's true i
really like that one too i got one and
the little gimme lipsett and i really
liked it a lot and it is just the stain
that's not opaque but it gives your lips
that nice color so let's see what else
do we talk about shouldn't talk about
lip balms for a few minutes cuz yeah i'm
going to talk too much about with cloths
in general and this is the thing about
lip gloss i made a joke about lip gloss
in a video of like two years ago where I
did it was something about you know
things people will never say about your
makeup and the joke was oh my goodness
that lip gloss looks so expensive
because really and truly lip gloss is a
lip gloss is a lip gloss it's lawson up
your lips it's you don't need to spend a
stupid amount of money on lip gloss like
I have I have this naked one which I'm
very happy that I have it's called love
childs and I really like it but is there
any difference between this and my NYX
matte matte my NYX butter gloss is now
it's a tiny bit more opaque but other
than that I mean it
not as big a big enough difference
before the price difference in my
opinion no it is a very nice gloss one
thing I did want to talk to you about
its really really nice are these um the
Laura Geller air wit lift wears these
things are so awesome I really like
these a lot these I feel like stand out
there more of a liquid lipstick for me
they remind you a lot of the ophir ones
in the MU see kind of texture to them
again they don't have a super long
lasting power but they're really
gorgeous and they smell amazing this one
is called sweet candy mousse and it's
gotta live with gold glitter in it so
I'd like to wear this one in the fall
and around the holidays and things where
I would try to get a little more fancy
um but but yeah I mean it mostly closes
you don't need to spend a ton of money
one that's a perfect example of lip
glosses you don't need to spend a lot of
11 are these stila ones these steel ones
are so stinking ordinary they're really
ordinary they're sticky there are their
coat they had a little bit of color to
them but they're ordinary there's
nothing magical about these lip glosses
nothing except for the click pen if you
want to hear to click pen you're good to
go but if you don't care about the click
pen it's like they're super super super
uber sticky uber sticky um the answer
she dances he hates lip gloss and warned
um he he says I've worn it for a show
and just know yes exactly um and then I
Tabitha says boo gloppy lip glosses yes
Shannon says i love buxom lip creams
they're basically gloss is not too
sticky buxom lip creams are very nice
and the buxom lip glosses they have that
minty nice chew on that a lot of people
really like that plumping this sentiment
eNOS that is difficult to find in a
drugstore version but again they're just
golf's is in the end so you really just
paying for that little mint eNOS nikki
says I used to be a lip gloss only grown
now don't wear them anymore now I'm a
mat and lipstick kick yes uh-huh yeah
definitely I used to just work lossless
to Jenny says amen to a glances of goals
and then sandras I'm a big fan of the
lorac lip glosses but I basically don't
wear any other bosses you know I'm never
tried on the rock lip gloss now I'm mas
Alexandria thank you so much for that
audience says I don't like lip gloss
only
one I like are the NYX butter glosses if
I get any and my sub boxes and give them
away yeah Sanders says agreeing lip
glosses the lip gloss viva la juicy 03
says Revlon has good lip glosses they do
they do if you need a lick once wear my
red bones got some red columns in here
this is a revelant yep remember ones are
nice this one is in the shade pinkpop
within my arms don't think I'm crazy
we're going somewhere after this you
want think I'm nuts all right yeah these
are not super sticky but you know it's a
gloss it's a nice loss and the smell
isn't horrible it's not great but it's
not horrible family not the best zone in
the world but they're not super sticky
you know what I'm saying um where Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works lip glosses an accounting
says for about 10 years only glimpses
and moved on I think we're all I say
honey lip glosses taba says lily once
they say hello to everyone she regrets
or comments are disabled oh no I don't
know how that happened to Lily Lily
Spurgeon my friend my my other producer
along with nerdling fold who's tabatha
be Shannon Duchess's her favorite lorac
one master to know now I want to go to
ulta and go get some lorac lip glosses I
need to get one of those lip gloss sets
and then Christmas says it revlon's
forty percent off this week at rite aid
yay and then Liam Lee says hi Lily sorry
your comments aren't working um let me
see what else watch out oh the marvelous
Moxie lipgloss is this is a weird one I
forget where I got this one I'm lost I
thought oh I got this in that um that
set that I got it's like a 30-dollar
mystery set these are similar to the box
and ones this is a really odd shade it's
like a metallic brown these are very
very sticky the scent smells like a mint
chocolate um but it looks beautiful on
the lips they're just sticky just sticky
