was that I have coffee and I'm quite
happy about this yet Tabitha says they
fixed it and Kelsey's on her phone so
we're gonna have a jump and people
watching that's so exciting
all right so as you can see behind me
I've laid out my arsenal I've got my
face timers here I've got my concealed
no I remember Sandra I've got concealers
here about face powders here I've got
all of my foundations here and then I've
got my face powders I'm sure there's
other things hiding in little hidey
holes so it might not be my entire
collection but it's kind of close oh I
missed uh I missed a setting powder so
let's go ahead and get started Rory
and it's in holy moly how we already
eight minutes in all right and let's go
ahead and let's talk about some some
face primer I have there's really two
main types of face primers mainly of
course there's more but too many types
you have lotion based and silicone based
or water-based and silicone base now
it's really really important to match
your foundation to your primer so if you
have a silicone based primer and you use
a water-based foundation you're mixing
oil in water and could cause your
foundation to break up so take a second
to look at the ingredients of your
primer before you put on your foundation
it may not be your foundations fall that
it looks horrible at the end of the day
maybe you put on a primer that doesn't
mesh with it so definitely be careful of
that I learned a lot from the collective
brain about foundation primers and that
which ones worked for different kinds of
skin Oh lavender orchids is givanni high
Cavani sorry off topic okay so looking
over here I have a few lotion based
primers cover effects has a really nice
one and the Laura Mercier one is also
very very nice I do not have any um any
drugstore face primers I get samples of
the high end primers and then I never
end up buying on drugstore face primers
so I would love to know from the
collective brain any drugstore face
primers that you guys enjoy I didn't
even know really that they made face
primers until not that long ago at the
drugstore I don't know I've somehow
missed them so so yeah so these are some
recommendations for the higher ends for
foundation primers i'm tess SI big pore
so I liked silicone base primers
especially my t-zone I've been trying
the pores no more from dr. brandt and
she's been liking that a lot a lot of
people that have big pores do enjoy the
silicone based primers like the smashbox
photo finish primer i have heard that
this fills pores like nobody's business
actually it does because i can see it
happening but case has the becca primer
is legit but there's a special way to
apply it definitely Leslie says the
maybelline baby skin is really good
Elysee says the Maybelline master prime
is smoothing and really good Kelsey says
anyone tried
nidia sensitive shaped ball from an
primer the tubers are raving right now
but it broke her out terribly and I have
not tried that Lily says the best
drugstore primer for her is Revlon ana
says she likes the dr. Brandt stuff too
justice says do you know the primer to
use with bare minerals complexion rescue
I wish I did one thing I did want to say
about the the photo finish pore
minimizing primer by Smashbox a lot of
people tell me that this breaks them out
so it's kind of that delicate balance
between filling pores and not breaking
out so you just kind of have to like
Sephora if you have a Sephora near you
can give you samples of these so you can
try them and see you know do some patch
testing things like that because I've
heard horrible things about my silicone
base primers breaking people out but
I've also heard from some people that
these are the best for oily skin the
silicone base because a lotion bases
tend to be too hydrating where the
lotion base ones are better for dry skin
that is kind of what I've heard
Yesenia says I was about to say my
ride-or-die is dr. Brandt so everyone
seems to be in a collective brain about
dr. Brandt dr. Brandt seems to be the
most popular one in the collective brain
right now laramie says it's their first
time in live chat yeah he's so happy to
have you okay I apologize if you know
some people don't like it when I'm
constantly turning around but it's like
one of those things I don't know what
else to do I don't have anywhere else
one day I'm gonna get a table in front
of me so please excuse when I turn
around I'm gonna go ahead and show you
let's see this is one that is a silicon
based primer that it's not bad if you
haven't already be ordering from Coastal
Scents this one is pretty good
neon the Coastal Scents beginnings face
primer but it's straight silicone like
straight silicone um actually it's fine
I just got a comment recently from a
subscriber of mine that I respect dearly
who watched my the balm brand review and
she was upset because I said that this
was a silicone based primer and she said
that it's not it's a silica based primer
and silica is a different compound than
silicone and then I said I'm so sorry I
did think that silicone was the same as
silicone it's not it's something
completely different and I said you know
I'm really sorry thank you for teaching
that because she said she couldn't even
watch the rest of the video because
she didn't trust my review now because I
didn't research the ingredients so then
someone just today commented that this
actually is a silicon-based primer the
ingredients that number one ingredient
is cyclic so siloxane and dimethicone
cross polymer so the first two
ingredients actually are silicone so
I've had done my research so if you were
wondering about the time bomb by the
moment is a silicone based primer I do
really like this primary it's not
amazing but it's good for me it's good
for me
KJ says she likes the benefit pore
filler but benefits not cruelty free if
anyone give me an alternative for that
that would be great and if you're
watching this on replay definitely leave
some comments down below some of your
favorite primer so you can be part of
the collective brain will make a boss
from this we can all learn from each
other and make sure we're spending money
on good stuff and not junky stuff so
definitely be a part of that down below
an unlikely primer that I really like a
lot is the vitamin C skin boost by the
body shop I when I went in there I was
looking for to try something new from
the body shop I'd never tried anything I
opened this up i'm swatching on my hand
I was like ooh that's very very nice and
this also is a silicone based primer I
believe and it just smells like like
oranges it smells amazing the people at
the store said that this wasn't
necessarily meant a hundred percent to
be a primer like it's just supposed to
be a skin smoother radiance thing but to
me and that's a primer I don't know it
looks like Yaya says good morning Jen
I'm glad I can be here on time I'm glad
you're here too and Jackie says la girl
has a great primer that's so awesome and
then Ashley says she really likes this
as well very cool she says she uses it
all the time Yesenia says the nevio bomb
kept makeup on her makeup on all day and
she doesn't have sensitive skin but she
did she did like it
Florencia says I made this video on
primer still can't get the right
foundation shade yes we're gonna get
into foundation stuff in a minute and
you Senya I need you to help me with
that because just any I know you were
telling me when we met did you have
trouble matching your skin tone so when
we get there definitely tap in as far as
different tips for matching eye
difficult to match skin tones amanda
says the black radiant shine control
primer is pretty good at controlling oil
it has Kalyn in it which I'm not
familiar with that angry
but I'm trusting you Amanda that you are
knowing all about this stuff
mpg so the Smashbox primer water kept
breaking down any foundation that she
used all right so those are kind of ones
this is another one actually said one
more the professional bomb by the bomb
this was my favorite pore filling primer
and so I found this one
yeah I don't have big pores so it's
difficult for me to review a primer for
filling pores the reason why I know
these more is because my husband John
was wearing makeup for a little while
long story and he tested out both of
these and he liked this one better so
that's kind of where I got my first hand
experience with these in big pores
because my husband randomly all right so
I'm gonna go ahead and put these away
and we'll get eye primers out all right
so I primers Nikki says she loves the
Make Up For Ever primers and Christa
says she loves the professional all
right so let's talk about some high
primers I have a collection of Urban
Decay eye primers these are known for
being good and I do think that they are
worth the hype I have four of them I
have the anti-aging which actually does
I do see some anti-aging effects with
this and I never say that like never
like when I just and skincare reviews I
never actually see results I do actually
see some results with the Urban Decay
anti-aging primer if I use it
religiously all the time my lip my lids
do seem a bit more taut and it's a very
nice primer as well so if you are of a
certain age or knots and you want to
minimize your wrinkles on your eyes I
definitely recommend this one
some people are finding this I know I
found it at my local crickets crickets
crickets my local Nordstrom Rack these
are the old packaging is now on sale so
you can find this one in this one at
Nordstrom Rack for super cheap right now
so definitely keep an eye out for those
this this is the new packaging and has
this crystal top and instead of being
like a squeezed out application we now
have a doe foot applicator again
we just don't have that hard packaging
that we used to have with a little
little little yo genie in a bottle
looking bottle so it'll be easier to get
it's kind of a mix of the two
packaging's i really really like this a
lot before with famous says Nordstrom
Rack had the big Urban Decay primers for
$10 I got everything you can imagine if
you have one go definitely definitely
Christa says she's a little bit late
that's okay girlfriend welcome
Laramie says totally benefit Air Patrol
I heard terrible things about the vent
of Air Patrol
I didn't hear a single good review of
benefit Air Patrol so Laramie I maybe I
don't know am I missing something here
Florencia says I agree General of my
original Urban Decay eye primer my
sample size lasted for a good time I
have just heard him reading some things
ever that you're funny because some
people are talking to each other so I'm
trying to read so and then CID sedessa
says she just got Elisabeth Moss
eyeshadow primer and her may in her
December hypsi bag and it was very
comparable to the Urban Decay very cool
sin is really really cool a notes that
Eden Eden is super cool Eden is
definitely my favorite right now because
it mutes out this coloration which is a
big win for me with eye primers what I
can get all of the discoloration of my
lids to go away with it I primer I'm so
happy I'm comparable to Eden oh they're
all in my lap I was smarter than that or
the Mac's Paint Pot in painterly and
then the mica beauty eye primer
this one is obnoxiously overpriced
though if you're going to get either
this one of this one I would definitely
go for the Mac peak hot pan early
because it's about half the price of the
mica beauty what we swatch it next to
Eden it is a tone difference Eden is
quite a bit lighter
I mean yeah quite a bit lighter so the
painterly will probably work better for
someone with medium medium to a little
tan skin tones but I'm gonna magic even
someone with a deeper skin tone I may be
able to enjoy using this because it'll
give a nice base for color and then also
with Eden the lighter you make your
sheet of paper the easier it may be to
layer on brighter colors so some people
a lot of people we use Nyx's pencil and
milk I've seen people a very deep skin
use the NYX pencil and milk and come up
with beautiful beautiful eye looks so
it's really what color you want your
base to lay your shadows on top of EDA
and I've just been absolutely in love
with right now I the only minor sin they
used to have one called sin I don't know
if they sell it anymore or what oh test
says I like the Paint Pot in soft ochre
I like that super stick use a shadow
stick really well yes and laramie says
have used the air patrol lightly and let
it sit for a few moments it works
wonders it dries very fast and will ball
up if you are not careful
that is great tips thank you so much for
that I really appreciate it actually
says she's fair and paint really works
great for her and msg says MPG not msg
says the NYX jumbo pencil in milk is
really good she got all the colors and
then Nicki says she loves the NYX and
milk with her color pop eyeshadows so
the thus in the minor sin is just
sparkly it doesn't need out
discolorations like the original sin did
it's more like the regular the regular
Urban Decay primer potion but with
glitter I don't know if you can see the
glittery glittery Ness but I don't like
it's like shimmer really I guess more
than glitter and they don't really like
minor sin as much as I like the regular
sins so just because of the
discoloration thing alright let's tour
eye primers drugstore eye primers that I
have been liking and not liking the elf
eye primer of course is very famous for
being amazing oh I just dropped the
glittery one there's a glittery one ooh
let me show you both of these okay this
is the glittery one and it is glitter
it's not um it's not shimmer its glitter
and then this is the regular elf primer
these are only a dollar each I do not
feel like they perform as well as let's
say the Urban Decay but if you got a
dollar and you want to use a dollar I
would recommend using a dollar on this
so there's the glittery one I don't know
if you can see it or not but I really um
I do like them but I don't think that
they can replace as good as some of the
more higher end ones but
they were Yesenia says Milani is awesome
and I have yet to pick that up I had one
and then I used it or something happy
I don't know basically I had it I don't
have it anymore so we're kind of out of
luck as far as me showing you that one I
didn't just go to the store and buy a
new one the Wet n Wild Fergie met Fergie
eyeshadow primer I did not like the
collective brain told me that it is
awesome and I was like but I didn't like
it no no everybody's like no it's good
the wet in long Fergie yes yes yes so I
tried it again and now I like it I like
it now amanda says Milani eye primers
her favorite also likes the Black
Radiance one for oily lids Lee says the
elf i prime is great I don't care for
the glitter one though just because of
the glitter and then krishna says the
wet and wild Fergie are cutting wet and
wild Fergie and her are cutting ties
she's hoping they repackaged some of the
better products from that line and then
Seth says no the Alpha primer for the
clip no l5 primer for the glitter not
the glitter primer let me clarify I use
it for everything wait on I met so you
do like the elf primer for glitter okay
Nicki says Nikita Cole says wet and wild
is also for oily lids but you need to
just need to set it right away and
Winkies blurb says I personally like the
Smashbox has a primer specifically for
the what I'm sorry I'm not even allowed
to read that look is that a typo like I
thinking that under eye area a primer
specifically for the under eye area
police's like what I'm very confused
what just happened
sorry she said never mind okay we're
gonna try to move tests sorry okay where
they are a hard candy eye primer I was
not a fan of I did not do good things
for me it didn't help my eyeshadow stay
on longer and it just did not do good
for me not did not like that one some
other ones that are really good the
Coastal Scents one is really good if
you're ordering from Coastal Scents this
is very there
comparable to the Urban Decay one I
think it's about ten bucks and the the
bombs put a lid on it is also good if
you're shopping on Birchbox calm the me
or an S one it's out discoloration this
one's really really nice yeah it's it's
very nice very very nice it's very wet
very very wet but you gotta use it
sparingly do we need the tiniest tiniest
tiniest little bit and then the last one
I once talked about is lorac behind the
scenes eye primer I do not like this one
this one doesn't do anything for me at
all I have not enjoyed using this
everybody that I've talked to about the
lorac I primer doesn't like it either I
don't know like if there's people in the
collective brain that thinks that
actually says anyone use the lorac
behind the scenes primer love loom yeah
I'm glad that you're here that's
exciting
I'd be curious to know what people in
the collective brain think of the lorac
because I personally don't like it and
most people that I know do not like it
so we need to keep moving on because we
got a lot of things to talk about we
only we're about halfway done with the
cheek that already all right Krista says
she doesn't want the lorac either before
we move on we need to take a little
coffee break alright that's it no weird
noises no crazy tingle just just a
coffee break
alright concealers alright so I'm gonna
see we're gonna rock through these
because we saw a foundations and powders
and all kind of stuff to go through
alright the time bomb concealer is one
of my favorite concealers everybody's
saying they don't like flu a rocky their
beauty Hoffman one best says she doesn't
like it either
Jackie is saying it says elf smudge pot
and color tattoos are good for eye
primers as well and then mpg says the
lorac eye primer big thumbs down so it
seems like yeah and then laramie says
she hates it too but he hates it what's
up with that what is up with that
alright concealers time bomb concealer
is a really really nice concealer I
heard positive things about the time
bomb concealer from any everybody and
anybody that I've ever heard use this
I've never heard anybody say that they
don't like this it is a tan on the
moisturizing side the the
and sealing ability is wonderful it's
really fantastic maybelline age rewind
Oh girlfriends right here we're gonna
want to talk about that one but yeah
this is a wonderful wonderful Universal
concealer and these time bomb the bomb
should be coming back I think about
January let me see I think they were
there in November December January
February February the bomb should be
back on whole look for 50% off you may
still be able to get some sales on the
bombs website do they may be all over
for the holidays I'm not sure but this
is really really really good if you're
saying some gems if you're dropping some
gems and in the collective brain and I
don't say it definitely make sure after
the chat is over come back drop them
into the comment section of the video so
that we can all learn from you I just
can't I can't I can't see all of them
there are too many Leslie says the
Maybelline age of wide dark circle
eraser is awesome that's what I have I
have the instant age rewind dark circle
eraser here and it really is wonderful
the only thing is is that it has the
sponge applicator that can't be washed
so just be aware of bacteria collecting
on the sponge applicator but it's really
really a fantastic product fantastic
products Jackie says the la girl
concealer is great and it's only four
dollars that's good to know
and then Beth says my holy Brook
concealer to the Urban Decay weightless
concealer and the Maybelline anti aging
okay Lily says that you can use if you
have really bad under-eye circles that
you can use a corrector first and then
your concealer corrector meaning if you
have like purple tones then you want to
go like a salmon salmon colored
corrector and that's one thing that I
can talk about Lily to do with this is
an e pearl or if you have redness and
you want to put green underneath this is
a salmon base salmon color based
concealer it is a bit pricey I'm sure
you'll be able to find cheaper options
but this is a wonderful wonderful
wonderful concealer by Yves pearl for
under-eye discoloration so yuh yes
that's what I said bad under eye circles
use a corrector that's why said Lily
yeah I know no-go
were corrupting yourself cause you said
bad but I read bad it's okay we're all
on the same page here we got this and
then Christmas says besides under urban
decay her favorite concealer here old
drugstore everyone's talking about the
LA girl concealers it's like la girl la
girl le girl so that's great to know
but yes salmon a salmon colored or pinky
tone colors for a purple like blue blue
tone discoloration and green for red
discoloration but this is a wonderful
concealer as well one that I really
really like it's a glamoflage light this
was sent to me by Victoria Delta when we
did a $20 makeup challenge swap and I
still really really like this a lot
it can give me some creasing here in
there so just be aware of that but for
an expensive option the glamoflage light
is wonderful wonderful Sammy says she
doesn't need a lot of coverage so elf
works good for her and then MGP says she
loves the NYX color correctors you can
use a palette of six shades and it's $11
I'm if for that palette of six shades
and then Elise says she likes a pixie
one bye bye under-eye yes hello my
requests here is the bye bye under-eye
from Mississippi this is the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye with
collagen vitamin C and K I personally
really really love this I have heard
that this creases like nobody's business
on some people but for me this one works
great it's extremely opaque you only
need to use the tiniest tiniest tiniest
a little bit it's really wonderful and I
I love it I personally love it and
comparable to that is this one by blue
cover-up is the name of the brand this
is also a really opaque concealer very
very opaque yeah this Lily says I'm use
a color wheel if you're confused I want
to use for your under eye circles
exactly and there's so many times like
when I'm editing my videos even last
night I was I have the the the screen
went for what's been makeup for whatever
reason was very yellow so I added a
purple filter a blue purple filter
because yellow and purple are opposite
on the color wheel pretty sure I'm
saying this right but purple and I think
yeah purple so I added a like a cool
tone filter and evened out my skin tone
so I use it for a video editing but you
can use a color wheel for you know
finding contrasting colors in your
makeup
and also for correcting like Lily was
saying so if you have purple then just
Google color wheel and look and see
what's on the opposite or if you have
you know redness you know look on the
color wheel to see what's opposite and
that's you know and you just do a quick
search to find the color wheel so that
helps one that I want to talk to you
about for dry eyes is the benefits faked
up I just have a sample size of this but
it does have this moisturizing core here
there's a moisturizer and then the
concealer is in the middle so if you
have dry under eyes this may be a good
option for you and then powder Oh make
it skin naked skin I got this it's way
too light for me because they didn't
have my skin tone so you know I'm
looking at mpg says favorite drugstore
concealer right now I would probably say
that the glamoflage likes my favorite
one right now but yeah so this I can't
give this a fair review because it's the
wrong color for me and I pushed it this
isn't fair and it's just I use it for a
brightener instead of a concealer at
this point so I can't give it a fair
review but the last thing I want to talk
about that concealers just powder
concealers I have one buy area everyday
minerals and then my holy grail the
summer bisque I wanted to put this on
for you since we're talking about this I
think I've done this I'm pretty sure
I've done this on camera before but I
specifically wanted to do it on this
because I can't stand watching back
these videos and seeing my under-eye
circles it drives me nuts
ooh they had to focus what happened whew
there I am okay I just want to show you
how amazing this bareMinerals concealer
and this is hashtag not sponsored
girlfriend bareMinerals does not know
I'm doing this they there this is
nothing like that this is just me
showing you something that I like as a
friend
alright here we go I'm gonna get up
close mmm uh-huh oh I'll watch the magic
watch the magic happen always tell me
this coming
I don't know do I not have whoa dogs
barking dogs barking do I not have
under-eye circles today I don't know
what's happening what a minute I feel
like a the effect isn't as good as it
once was yeah it is it's hard to see I
guess my under-eye circles are not that
bad today but I don't know if can you
see the difference I think I can see the
difference usually it's more dramatic
maybe it's my lighting I don't know yeah
I could tell difference oh it's because
let me turn this light on one quick hold
on turn this light on my whole thing is
about to go out the window if I can't
get my lighting right all right here we
go
there we go that's better can you see
the difference now we are my under-eye
circles you wouldn't know I was up till
3 o'clock in the morning last night all
right there we go there we go
yeah you can see the different total
difference total difference okay that
was like a total fail of a tutorial not
tutorial but a demo there we go now it's
working it's magic that's what I'm
talking about the lighting was just off
there we go
totally better right I love this
concealer I love it it makes me so happy
there we go that's what I was looking
for powder concealer I never would've
thought powder concealer was a thing
that was possible that I would like big
thumbs up on powder concealers I didn't
realize this thing is going out of focus
so bad oh my goodness I haven't looked
at myself for a while that is the bare
minerals this is the multitasking SPF 20
concealer and summer bisque and
everybody that I talk about really
really loves this one so yes totally
gone totally gone so highly recommending
this one I love demoing that one because
I feel like you can really see the
difference it's pretty awesome so
alright fizzy pop is leaving good luck
with your Christmas shopping lasting
power is good last member is good I
would say that you get that keep this
look for a good 4 to 5 hours and then
you start seeing it go away just like
any powder so that that's something you
can throw in your purse if you're
concerned about it and just reapply if
that's bothering you
um I don't know how much it is off the
top of my head I do know they sell it at
Sephora it's bare minerals so I would
imagine it's probably around the twenty
dollar mark for a concealer something
like that so let's go ahead and move on
to foundations all right foundations
this is something I've been waiting to
talk about I'm excited to talk about
this I'm excited to tap into the
collective brain for all of this good
morning Julia I'm merry Christmas to you
all right
so foundation don't let anybody tell you
in makeup videos that you need a full
coverage foundation if you don't like I
challenge you to look in the mirror and
look at your skin and see how flawed it
truly is and then decide how much
coverage who truly truly mean and go
with the least amount of coverage
possible like when I was 20 I didn't
need to wear any foundation at all I
mean even now I could probably get away
with not wearing much foundation at all
because my skin does not I do not have
problem skin I'm very very lucky it's
all genetic it's just I'm lucky it's a
luck thing there's no skill involved
here it's just straight look so I try
really hard to use a lower coverage
foundation unless I'm filming or going
to a wedding and even if I am going to a
wedding like full coverage foundations
are just it's too much it's too much and
that's when you see somebody like and
you look at them you go oh my gosh they
have way too much makeup on so just be
be aware of full coverage foundations
even though they make you look flawless
flawless doesn't make necessarily make
you look good you know what I mean so
just be careful of that because you you
know overall you need to wear the makeup
that makes you happy that's what it
comes down to but also at the same time
you want to feel comfortable and if
you're new with using foundation I would
say always err on the side of less
coverage sometimes or like like Cara Lee
Sang fit me when I need full coverage
and tinted moisturizer most days yeah
that's what yeah definitely Nikki Nikki
says I don't like foundation all I only
like the like the
Mattox powder foundation liquid doesn't
work for her it looks so unnatural I
know my mother has a lot of age spots
and things she uses that the foundation
just to kind of mute out discolorations
in her age spots and things like that
and she really likes that K just as I'm
playing with fuller coverage and it's so
so easy to go to K face it really really
is some some recommendations that I have
for you for foundations that will give
you a nice coverage but it's not it's
not gonna make you go straight to cake
phase you have a few all right okay I
have a few I have quite a few can see
how many fit that because that this is
what I personally like this one I'm not
sure if you can get any more the bar at
the BB cream Garnier Garnier BB cream
some people say that they do not like
this recently especially I've heard a
lot more people saying they don't like
this I don't find anything I don't like
companies I absolutely love it this is
the light/medium the combination to oily
skin one really really really like this
one a lot I think they're discontinuing
that this is one that everybody raves
about like when I got this a generation
beauty and I was getting ready on
periscope like all of you that you guys
remember this if you were there
everybody was like oh you got the
cosmetics CC cream you go to try yeah
you gotta try it out like people were
freaking out yeah Annie SEZ BB creams
expire that is true I am really bad with
things expiring if they don't smell I
keep them I know that's bad but I can't
stop like I not throw away products I
just can't I am NOT like I'm really bad
at that but you're right you're right
a cosmetic CC cream best thing ever
Krista says this really is very very
nice anna says the dr. Joffe mood with
the laura geller bright and balanced
foundation over it works well for you i
tried to dr. jart BB cream and it grayed
out my skin it made me look dead like it
was like grey like straight-up grey on
me I don't know what happened there this
is a wonderful wonderful CC cream CC
creams are going to be more opaque if
you're new to CC creams and be
creams and all that stuff BB creams are
gonna be moat for the most part less
coverage than a CC cream but CC creams
are supposed to be color correcting they
also have the skin benefits of of the BB
creams so they're very very nice if you
want a little bit more coverage but you
don't want a full coverage kind of thing
and you want those skin benefits on the
Lumia time free CC anti-aging color
correcting cream is also one that I
absolutely love this is a drugstore one
Kaylee says she thinks the egg cosmetics
has a funny Snow now you're making me
want to smell it does kind of have a
funny smell kind of alcohol Li you put
some on my hand just to make sure I'm
not just smelling the packaging it does
it's like fruity almost I never noticed
that before that it's kind of fruity
here I never noticed that that's so
interesting
Zef Starr says Marcel has a good BB
cream I love Marcel as a brand I'm very
interested in trying that Julia said she
knew her from her friend that elf just
came out with a BB cream at drugstores I
have not had good experiences with elf
like foundations and things so I'm a
little skeptical of those but who knows
who knows let's see I actually says oh
she's disappearing come back Ashley come
back I wanted to read what you said up
hold on I lost it ah Shannon says I'm
really loving the bareMinerals
complexion rush you tinted hydrating gel
cream light coverage evens out her skin
to come but looks totally natural
somehow I'm like oh okay
mom mary says I just got you D naked
skin hate the snow but I like the finish
is the first foundation that doesn't
give me grease face and then lavender
and lavender is Cavani Cavani says Kat
Von D foundation is straight cake face
for her the Lockett foundation I'm
assuming is what she's talking about and
Sammy says I find the Physicians Formula
CC cream and and the I'm assuming you
mean the low mean comparable Lee says
the elf BB cream is okay she uses on
days when she wants just a little bit of
coverage and then Hooda says the
Maybelline Dream pure BB cream is pretty
good Krista says yes a L'Oreal
we can't wait to try it yes the cushion
ones I'm really excited to try those two
oh my goodness I need to go back into
the drugstore and get more stuff from
the drugstore I haven't been shopping in
the drugstore in a while and there's a
lot of really cool stuff coming out so
really want to get some more stuff in
the drugstore so anyway let me touch you
about these so these are those both very
good and then also this is a recent
discovery of mine though the Rimmel BB
cream matte nine and one skin perfecting
super makeup I did not like this in the
summertime I felt like it was a little
too heavy but in the winter I'm really
really enjoying this a lot also it was a
little bit too light for me in the
summer so now it's like perfect Joann
says hey there Jenna try my new elf
foundation serum and I really like it my
daughter swears by their acne foundation
Thank You Joann for that I appreciate it
Annie says grease face said it with stay
matte by Rimmel or fit me matte by
Maybelline yes Rimmel stay matte we're
going to talk about that in a bit
Ashley says any suggestions for full
coverage that's not met so at Ashley
Maroney ma ro n ey if you want to answer
the question but the ones here the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless I
really really love this a lot I also
have the what happened to it oh here we
go
the l'oreal infallible Pro matte I like
the fit me just a little bit better
um but definitely normal to oily skin
not dry skin I've heard this is terrible
for people with dry skin I've heard the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte is a little
bit better for everybody but this is
building up the coverage like I don't
wear these on the daily this is too much
coverage for me on the daily way too
much um and then also another one that's
good for just a little bit more coverage
than a BB or CC cream is the L'Oreal
visible lift blur foundation I like this
one as well this one feels really good
it is a silicon based foundation so if
you have a silicon based primer that
will match very very well with this it
definitely definitely a win on this one
for me and then I got this a generation
Beauty the cargo HD picture perfect CC
cream this is one of those that comes
out white and then it's supposed to
match to your skin tone so that's the
way it looks and then when you blend it
out see it's changing
it does have a little bit of a yellow
tint to it so just be aware of that at
least on me
I would imagine will be yellow tinted no
matter who you are but it definitely is
yellow Tintin just hasn't aware and this
one is in the shade medium so there you
go for fuller coverage foundations I
move oh another thing before we get into
floor coverage foundations let's talk
about powder foundations oh my god it's
only in 15 that's left
what okay one thing about powder
foundations very quickly powder
foundations are a great way to beef up
the coverage of a BB cream or a CC cream
without going to cake face so on today I
recommend the laura geller baked balance
and Brighton foundation this one's a
medium I really really love this one a
lot the Mary Kay mineral powder
foundation is wonderful and the Too
Faced cocoa powder foundation I feel
like this one is probably the most full
coverage of the powder foundations that
I own I feel like I can wear this on its
own and really get a nice coverage also
the lorac also gives a lorac comment
this is but these are very nice to put
on over top of what my son is doing
these are very nice to start to top over
top of the creams just to give them a
little more coverage instead of using a
face powder or if you want a lighter
coverage but you don't want to use and
you're like in a rush this is a nice way
to skip a step so instead of using a
foundation and a powder you can just use
this and I'll give you a nice coverage
without and you get to skip a step so if
you're in a rush this is a nice way to
go as well also you can throw this in
your person you can touch this up a lot
easier than you can a cream foundation
or liquid foundation okay so once that
are more full coverage this one the bare
minerals fair skin I'm not a fan of this
one is very it's lelee it's very very
oily you do need to shake it up but I
feel like even when you shake it up it's
still at this point is not
I haven't tried the bareMinerals
original Beth that's wanted to know
Christa says for some reason powder
foundations don't work for you use them
as a um use them as a a face powder over
top of the BB cream you'll find just use
it as that use instead then but I do not
care for this I do still use it but I
feel like as it ages it's getting worse
this is probably gonna end up not
getting used up completely because it
just doesn't and I don't like the way it
blends on to my skin I feel like it kind
of goes on patchy and it just it doesn't
work well for me the ones that I have
that are like a kind of like a cakey
kind of formula the time bomb by the
bomb this is pretty full coverage this
is like a medium to full coverage if you
have dry skin you may want to try one of
these because they are more creamy and
only kind of thing so you may like this
this is the Marc Jacobs one and some are
bisque this is getting old this is on
its way out but again very very full
coverage and then Anna's talking about
cover effects drops can go extremely
full coverage yeah just be careful with
that full coverage girlfriend don't do
it if you don't have to I mean it's I
think it's better to do a light coverage
and then use concealer to correct you
know what I mean like you just color
correctors use concealers to correct and
then use a lighter coverage foundation
so you end up going cakey coz cakey is
cakey you know Holy Grail more full
coverage foundation is the Immaculate
liquid powder foundation mattifying
oil-free by hourglass this is wonderful
it's a fantastic fantastic foundation I
really enjoy this a lot also you can
control the coverage it's got a nice
pump and you can control the coverage
you can just use a little bit and get a
nice light light coverage or you can
bump it up and you can get a pretty full
coverage foundation it's very very nice
Annie wants to know what shade I am in
the foundation I am in light medium
light medium alright and then moving up
the coverage align the number-7 lift and
luminate foundation I really like the
way this feels as well unfortunately I
don't know what I was thinking like how
in the world is this gonna back to my
skin tone like what was I thinking in
the drugstore
I don't even know so IM rainy i may stop
reading for a second but it really is a
nice foundation I just wish I had been
able to find my skin tone here the other
one that I'm kind of on the fence about
is the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I feel like this one's really
nice for filming but for day-to-day I
feel like it's to take faci for me I
don't feel like it makes me look like I
was born this way it's supposed to be a
full coverage foundation meeting with
full coverage foundation but it's
supposed to look like real skin I don't
feel like it makes me look like I have
real skin I think it looks like fake
skin but I do like the way it looks for
filming um I do enjoy it for that but
this is the shade vanilla by the way and
then the last foundation that I wanted
to talk to you about is the SA Lauder
Double Wear this is another one that is
really really good for full coverage is
very famous for being amazing for full
coverage just be careful as far as using
this all over your face that you don't
go to cake face just use it lightly and
you'll still get a really nice coverage
if you put on just a little bit just
don't overdo it
um and this will be wonderful Zep star
says she hates it Gina says she returned
the born this way and then Nikki says
the forest stay all day
Sephora stay is amazing lasts all day
with a natural finish highly recommend
and thinking that I can frame real quick
and just look at some of the comments
about different foundations that you all
recommend let's say love loons has any
recommendations for the foundations for
a dried or normal skin textured acne
scar drugstore or high-end so definitely
leave those down below or in the
collective brain Hooda says I like its
first I don't know what you summon it uh
uh it it when you guys are typing give
me a favor and put the name of the
foundation instead of it because it's
really hard for me to follow the
conversation I want to know what you're
talking about
jessica says Estee Lauder she's heard
it's not photo friendly I've actually
found it to be very photo friendly in my
experience that doesn't mean that other
people can't have bad experiences with
it but I had really I've had really good
experience with it with being with
photographs this
I'm missing he says I'll top it but I
kind of wonder what happens to return
makeup I kind of wonder - oh who does
talking about the Estee Lauder Double
Wear thank you so much Krista says with
cakey foundation using damp Beauty
Blender sprayed with fix+
excellent hit Krista well done let's see
it she said it unque --xx it wonderful
Thank You Krista for that tip Stef says
waiting for the later shades of the Born
This Way to hit stores that they ever
well afraid of afraid considering the
original line was so what dark and just
me and my license any recommendations
for super oily skin and Gina says
celebration foundation by it cosmetics
she loves and then Jessica Burd says
what primer would you use with it the
Estee Lauder the Estee Lauder
um see I've used this with silicone and
with water-based foundations I'm not
sure 100% whether this is a water-based
foundation I think that it is so I
probably err on the side of a lotion
Janee primer rather than a silicone
based primer because also silicone based
primers tend to be a little heavy or
anyway on the skin so I would just use a
moisturizer with this or a lotion based
primer with this that would be my
personal recommendation as a non makeup
artist Beauty blenders do have flawless
application Beauty blenders are
wonderful also the Real Techniques one
soon as these are open the Real
Techniques one is also fantastic I find
that the use of both of them are pretty
much equal even though they're different
shapes I do feel like the regular Beauty
Blender does last longer all right I'm
gonna go ahead and talk about some
brushes actually here let's talk about
some some face powders very quickly
Rimmel stay matte is a go to amazing I
need to get a new one
amazing Milani this is the multitasker
face powder amazing Mac mineralize
skinfinish amazing Besame translucent
powder smells like vanilla amazing it is
loose powder those if you don't like
loose powder you may not like it NYX
blotting powder is okay and that's all
the powders I hats
and then finishing powders this is my
new love I've had this for a while and I
and I haven't used it because it was
John's and I never used it and it is so
fun to use I've been using it all week
it just kind of brings my makeup
together this is the smooth operator by
Tarte really enjoying this I know some
people just got this in their FC bags
I'm curious to see what other people
other people think of this and then this
is the original mineral veil by bare
minerals I'm also enjoying this MBG is
talking about the Cody airspun powder
and wondering if it's good I'm Hooda
says it's pretty good and she'll says
anyone having recommend recommendations
for how to set dry skin I would say for
dry skin I really like these primers
these right here I don't know see I
can't do it where where are my dry skin
girls where is my collective brain on
the dry skin yeah I don't know my
instinct is telling me to do these but
then they're like there's silicone Basin
and your silicone doesn't necessarily
work well with dry skin so now I'm like
rewinding myself and thinking man um
everyone some that they love the Cote
airspun that's good to know
good to know and setting sprays yeah
setting sprays great idea see that's my
love the collective brain because you
guys know way more than I do and this is
just a medium for all of us to get all
of our thoughts together I love it um
let's see yes yes yes all right so these
were other ones I wanted to talk to you
about as far as the setting powders this
is the Mary Kay translucent powder that
I really like it also I got this in a
subscription book this is by your
mineral Sweden I don't know but it's a
really nice setting powder I like it a
lot so the last thing I wanted to talk
about because we've only got five
minutes left our application tools we
start talking about the Beauty Blender
and the Real Techniques sponge those are
wonderful you're supposed to Pat it into
your skin girlfriend I just rub it I
don't see any difference patting it in
but I think if you want a more full
coverage you're going to want to Pat and
if you don't care you can rub it I do
you
do what help is for you it helps with
you for for foundation brush applicators
I really like flat top kabuki brushes
this ones by outer beauty and then this
one is by Sigma they're almost exactly
the same my friends and on periscope
tabatha was there I remember I was like
you can't tell the difference between
the the outer beauty one and the the
Sigma 1 and there were like signal ones
on the left I'm like wait a minute what
how did you know that and it's because
of the ferrule they saw it on the
ferrule but as far as the brushes my
outer beauty does not sponsor me but
they're one of my favorite brush brands
I just discovered them at IMATS and
they're amazing and these perform
exactly the same the outer beauty brush
that you can get I think it's five
brushes for I think 60 bucks for their
face brush set
totally totally worth it I have to say
though like I hate to say this but I
have to say it Sigma brushes are
wonderful John you are in your underwear
you need to go out what do you mean to
tell me tell me quickly but stay out of
the camera daddy camera because you're
in your underwear one what sorry on our
second honey man's husband I don't think
we want to eat I don't think it's gonna
taste very good we'll talk about it
later okay I got five minutes left let
me finish I'll see you later okay
five minutes and we'll go make the
gingerbread house okay all right sorry
he's very excited about building this
gingerbread man house okay so anyway I
hate to say but I do love my Sigma
brushes I wish that I didn't love them I
bought them outright they were not sent
to me Sigma has never once contacted me
to ask me if I want to review anything
we are not affiliated in any way but I
really do love the Sigma brushes that I
got and this was one of them that I got
this is the the f80
they had a set there was like Sigma's
favorite something like that and I
really really like all of us I got most
of them are eye brushes so we won't go
into all of them but wonderful wonderful
wonderful another one that I like this
obnoxiously expensive is this Marc
Jacobs brush this is the face - this is
really really nice I had the idea I was
gonna use this for contouring when I
bought it but it's not for contouring
it's for applying foundation and it's
O's off it's so good I saw someone was
asking about morphe brushes I only
gotten one morphe brush and it was in a
subscription box it was from they're
really inexpensive line and I did not
like it at all it was very very fluffy I
ended up giving it away it was horrible
it was absolutely horrible but that's
one brush from the least expensive lines
so I cannot speak to the rest of it
let's see other brushes face brushes
that I want to talk about me say all
right for face powder I like using
fluffy brushes like this one by Real
Techniques is really really nice this is
actually their blush brush but I use
this to apply powder I use it to apply
finishing powder and also a loose powder
very very nice
Zef Starr says she loves Luxy brushes
Lexi brushes are awesome I do have a
couple I have this one this bronzer one
that I love
let's see also everyday minerals is a
really nice brand for brushes so this is
a sigma brush this is the tapered
highlighter brush but I've used this for
under-eye for putting on my my powder
concealer it's very very nice I really
like this one a lot I think I said this
is a half 35 I'm trying the other things
oh this was a tart brush this was part
of their holiday brush set that I used
for under-eye concealer also this one I
use for under-eye concealer this is by
Real Techniques and this is the setting
brush I like this for under-eye for a
powder concealer for cream concealers I
mostly use my fingers I really like that
Real Techniques brushes are wonderful
they really are eco tools are absolutely
rocks and eco tools is a wonderful brand
as well I really enjoy those I'm trying
to think if there's any other brushes
that missing also it cosmetics makes
really really wonderful brushes they're
very very fluffy though they're very
they're really fluffy so just be aware
of that for the most part let's see
anything else this is an Ecotools brush
that I really like this is the skin
perfecting the only thing I don't like
about this is it's kind of small so it
takes a really long time it's also
extremely dense so it moves the
foundation around a lot so I find myself
patting this rather than brushing it
because it's just so so dense ELF
brushes I don't particularly care for
for foundations specifically but I do
like the
lots of other things I like your eye
brushes I like their bluff dresses I
like their arm I like them for doing
loose powder but for for foundation I
haven't found a good elf foundation
brush KJ KJ says it cosmetics are nice
and she loves her Real Techniques
brushes is F star says since the chat
kind of messes up your watch time can
you air at a second on a second channel
or you or you now I have no idea I
didn't even think about doing that
honest on like a second Channel
yeah I even think about that that's
actually kind of an interesting idea to
put these on a separate channel but I
don't know I don't know I don't know all
right my friends it is officially 11
o'clock Lou Jean says Wayne Goss for
powder products are amazing the goat
hair helps the application Wayne Goss
brushes I own one and I love it but it's
just a little I brush it's a little like
Creasy I brush Lindsay wants to know
what's the cost on the high-end morphe I
am honestly not sure Laura says what's
your opinion about the Coastal Scents
brushes they're very hit and miss very
hit and miss I've gotten some eye
brushes that the bristles are all funky
