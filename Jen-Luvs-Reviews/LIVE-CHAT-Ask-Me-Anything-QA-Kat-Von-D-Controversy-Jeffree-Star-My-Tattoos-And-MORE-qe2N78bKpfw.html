you so much I appreciate that
wasanta safe travels general miss your
updates thank you so much for that I
appreciate you alright question here we
go Bridget question better best starter
brushes best high-end palette to get
first
okay so starter brushes definitely Moda
moto moto moto moto moto you get
intimate Walmart they have all different
styles they've got like the bright the
bright color went they're all the same
it's just whichever handle that you like
better they make the best brushes for
the less expensive price there are
definitely some higher-end brushes that
I feel like perform a little bit better
but not by a ton I feel like the motor
brushes are incredible Real Techniques
also makes really great brushes their
brush sets from both brands are very
very good just kind of look for a brush
set where you feel like those shapes
look good I don't know if you're a
beginner though maybe let me go and grab
my brushes they're right here my eye
brushes kind of give you an idea okay so
you want to get okay these are all my
dirty brushes but you want to get a
brush that's kind of shaped like this
it's a little bit fluffy and tapered
like that okay you want to get a brush
that's kind of like that there's that's
a standard kind of blending brush so you
can Pat color into the crease with this
you can blend with this this is a must
have also a must have is a brush that's
shaped like this
we're packing on color that's how I
choose a pack on color one that's got a
taper like that some people prefer to do
a flatter one I find those don't work
well for me so I don't use those even
though I know a lot of people swear by
them and I get you know comments on why
aren't you using a flat shader brush
because I like flat shader brush is like
that the UM the flat synthetic ones the
ones that are flatter than us but this
is the kind of works best for me for
packing on color in a large area another
one that's essential is a fluffier brush
this is a motor one I think this is a
motor pro one but they're all you know
it's very similar but a real fluffy one
like this that's tapered these three I
feel like are the ones these cut this
tissue these three shapes okay better I
feel like me essentials now if you're
going to go a little bit more a little
one like this without so loud airplane a
little flat smudgy guy like this for
like detailing packing another one like
a brow brush is super helpful something
like this like an angled brush like this
for brows you can also pack a straight
line of color into the crease with
something like that that's really nice
to have a little pencil brush is really
nice the ones that are like like
something like this this one's really
nice this is a morphe 36 this is my
favorite brush that I got from that
Laura Lee set this one is really good
and I'm not a Marshall girl I don't have
a code just so you know I'm not morphe
person but this brush is really good
what you don't want is something that's
like this this is a motor brush but this
is too tall this is this is difficult to
work with it's very stiff and very tall
I don't like this one at all you want
one that's a little bit that's like a
little shorter a little softer a little
rounder like that but those are kind of
the the eye brushes that you definitely
want to look for like I said there's
three those three are really important
and then as far as face brushes of
course I don't have my face brushes
really far away um I would say a flat
kabuki brush definitely a flat kabuki
brush the ones that are like her oh that
way over there hold on I'll get them oh
doom will do it Oh get him but it's like
a like a brush and it's like flat on the
top they stick out real fat oh like this
some brush like this this
the y6 I don't like this one how sad is
that this is a morphe y6 that lauralee
like raves about and everybody raised I
don't like it it doesn't it doesn't work
well for me it's too fluffy up here it's
not dense enough I don't like this brush
am I the only one that doesn't like this
brush that might be like it I like when
it's really dense really really dense I
feel like this one isn't dense enough
for me and then a blush brush so
something like this around in one mrs. C
I have the loli brush set that I just
got that I never reviewed so this one is
pretty nice so this is the AR 14 I'm
just pulling them out because that's
what I was testing so like a fluffy
round brush again
Moda it's good and then if you those I
would say are the essentials like
something like this and something like
this but if you want to go a little
further like some kind of angled brush
like this of course this is more Fiji
because that was what I was testing
that's when I have dirty something
angled to do either you can use blush
you can do contour with this like an
angled brush like that I really like and
then like a fan brush or something for
highlighting like a little brush so like
I'll use something like this for heiling
this is Mota I'll use this for
highlighting sometimes I'll use this for
packing powder under the eye but not too
much because you don't want to crease if
you're of a certain age and you have
wrinkles but packing powder there
highlighting things like that I use a
brush like that but those are kind of
the add-ons really for me the essentials
are something for blush here's a good
one this is a moto metallic that's for
blush and then something like this for
foundation them but you can use this for
contour you can use this for highlight
if you're really careful those are kind
of my essentials and now I'm gonna
scroll down and see what everybody else
is saying because I just spent a long
time doing that alright let me go back
up because I missed a lot when I was
just blah blah blah blah dying okay I
use this is a 50 to 250 millimeter 50 55
to 250 millimeter it's EFS macro 0.85 m
/ 2.8 feet I don't know but this is the
lens that I use it's like super long
this is why I can't like get further out
is because there
is so long it only like it only captures
like here like you can't even it can't
zoom out any further than I'm already
seeing that which is like the downfall
is lens but I really like the way that
everything looks with this lens it makes
me happy so this is the one that I use
I'm gonna put this back on before it
gets dust in it
yeah Canon 70d is my base oh I got to
get this back on cuz I don't want to get
dust in it there we go okay Jessica
wants to know where do you live it's so
early here I live in the Baltimore area
I live just south of Baltimore in the
suburbs I used to live closer to the
city before I moved into this house I
lived like a spit from the city which
was an awful neighborhood but we you
know it was our first house and that was
what King we could afford so it was whoa
I was a cute little house though first
time here for goddes okay Kalea I'm
gonna say cool eeeh I hope I got that
right
oh thank you AJ for being glad that I
feel better this week thank you so much
okay i'ma see if I can find any more
questions Katie's first time live happy
to have you here George oh here's my
question for you Jen what makeup are you
talking wait what makeup are you taking
with you I'm gonna do that's gonna be my
first video for when I'm gone so I
haven't filmed it yet I haven't filmed
it but I'm gonna film that and that's
gonna be the video that you're gonna get
the first video that I do when I'm gone
if that makes sense I'm stacking up
videos for you so I'm gonna have ten
videos so you'll have at least one video
week I'm thinking they should go live on
Tuesdays because I feel like Tuesday is
the day that I'm used to uploading so
I'll probably put that on Tuesday so the
Tuesday this we're leaving a week from
yesterday so not this Tuesday but the
following Tuesday is when I'm gonna put
that video up I haven't packed yet so I
don't know yet but I already know that
one of the first videos when I come back
is going to be what
got by missed while I was gone that I
didn't take with me cuz like leaving my
babies behind I hate it I hate it
luan have you ordered from DHgate makeup
no I have not I have never tried Knobble
shadows
you
Cooper wants to know how I feel about
gay people I am a huge border of the
LGBTQ community love love love love love
love not everybody because you can't
love everybody in an entire group
because every single person is a unique
individual and there's great people and
every group and there's mean people in
every group so I don't feel like I can
say I love every single person and that
community because I haven't met
everybody but I'm a huge supporter of
LGBTQ rights I should say lgbtq+ rights
I feel like it's human rights I don't
see it as a political issue I feel like
whenever we're talking about human
wellbeing that it's not a political
issue that it's it's human it's a human
thing and that's that's the way that I
feel about it so hopefully that answers
your question
Nadine 'he's been sick oh no I hope that
you feel better soon okay
I'm keeping going Ashley says Sigma or
morphe Sigma definitely there's a sheet
I mean like honestly like I feel like
there's a huge quality difference
between Sigma and morphe I feel like
Sigma is head and shoulders better than
morphe in my opinion but I do have some
morphe brushes that I really like but I
don't know like I got one of like the
Sigma collector set or something and I
really love those brushes there's an ax
brush in there that I don't like Julie
said she thought I was on vacation
already aw thanks I'm glad that you're
here
Mel my favorite brand of eyeshadow
favorite brand of eyeshadow is probably
Julius place is the most consistent so I
would probably pick them juvie has
placed or coloured raine those are those
are probably my two favorite consistent
amazing eyeshadows like they don't do me
wrong like there's there there's I think
there's one colored reina eyeshadow in
the Queen of Hearts palette that I'm
kind of like man on it's called ladyship
I believe it's like a purpley shade like
I even know what it is but I've never
liked
from either brand like I know when I get
a pallet from them I know it's gonna be
amazing and I think those are the only
two brands I can say that about Banshee
news what's your favorite eyeshadow
palette at the moment at the moment she
face chocolate gold that was a really
good palette man it was really good
I really like the jaclyn hill morphe
palette a lot too I'm really loving that
I've been trying out I did my second
full look my third dip into the life's a
drag palette yesterday and the matte
I'll give you a hand the mats are
amazing
the shimmers I'm having a little trouble
with but the mats are really good so I'm
working with that but I would say if I
to pick any favorite eyeshadow palette
it would probably be chief a shop of
gold that's the one that I'm loving the
most lately but I do love Mike my
devious place I always reach for like my
magic palette and my um Sahara it's
amazing the difference I use Sony Vegas
for the problem first four and a half
years of my channel but like all the
editing little things that I do
that's all Final Cut Pro stuff it's all
Final Cut Pro plugins because what
happens with Final Cut Pro is you can go
and there's a there's a website I get a
lot of plugins from it's called pixel
film studios and I go over there and I
get the plug-in you just download it you
installed it and it automatically goes
into Final Cut Pro and you can use it so
a lot of like the the flippies and the
words and all that stuff that's all
pixel film studio plugins goddess kaliya
what brush do you what best brush to do
i primer concealer as an eye primer i
would say if that would be the only time
I would use flat shader brush --is is
something like that I don't really do
concealer as primer a lot because I find
that it creases on my lids so I'm still
trying to figure that out but something
like this and of course I grab another
more Fu brush I promise you I'm not
doing this on purpose it's just those
the ones I was testing so that's what's
dirty this is the morphe m4 21 brush so
something flat like that would be good
for that something that because with
cream products you want something that's
going to be flat for most Wolfer cream
mr. packing as far as concealer goes
what I like to do is I like to put the
concealer on and then I blend it a
little bit with my fingertips and then I
use a brush like they're all over there
I use like a kind of like this one this
one is stupid expensive this is the N
artis brush this is the artists artis
oval something I can't find the number
on it and my that blind I don't know but
something like this but like Moda makes
a set like this that works just as well
let me and I just as well look close and
I blend it in with that or I use a
beauty sponge I don't really use like a
flat like a brush brush for concealer I
feel like it's it's sneers and smudges
I'd rather use something like this so
for actually does make a really good
brush for that but I don't know I have
so many stinkin brushes oh here we go
here's the Mota one
oh here's the Mota one looks like that
so this works really well for concealer
I do it before when I think my friend
Nancy had gotten that one for me but I'm
not sure where that is at this moment in
this moment all right but yeah I wish I
knew what it was or where it is also I'd
show you cuz I wasn't if I was prepared
for that question I'm totally having you
sing Katrina what is the best packing
eyeshadow brush you've tried this is the
thing is I feel like different brushes
work better with different formulas and
I feel like I have to constantly switch
back and forth between different things
so like some some eyeshadow is honestly
like people look at me like I'm crazy
but I have to do what works for me and
I'm not professional makeup artist I
just do what works okay and sometimes
I'll find that a fluffier brush like
this this is a color pop brush this is
really good like this like oh saying the
the one I usually use for blending up in
the crease sometimes I'll put color on
with this because I feel like it puts
color on really lightly and then I can
build it up which is why I used it in
the crayon the Crayola video because I
was worried about the powder just going
everywhere so I wanted to just put on a
little bit at a time and that's why
I use this one but like the packing
brushes like this this one I use all the
time this is a beauty junkies all-over
shader brush like brushes like that but
I mean really you can find those from so
many different brands you don't
necessarily need a certain one this is
that one we got in boxycharm from the
vintage I like this one this one's a
little bit flatter but I really feel
like you just kind of have to play with
different ones or for different formulas
I don't feel like that one works the
same with one formula as the other
excuse me oh here we go Natalie Thank
You Natalie for those of us in the UK
motor brushes are available from royal
and langnickel x' website Thank You
Natalie I appreciate that
sent me a lot of brushes for free but I
promise you that it's not why I talk
about them they send me them for free
because they know that I'm gonna talk
about them because how much I like them
it was like in that order they gave me
some and I like was so excited about
them that they continued to send me
brushes it wasn't like you know they
send them to me and then I rave about
them and then they send me more so that
I get more brushes I don't need any more
brushes they never sent me another brush
in my life I'd be okay with that I got
plenty of brushes I just really really
liked them but I do want to let you know
that I do know the people over at moto
and some of the people not everybody
Amy BH Cosmetics brushes are great I've
never tried those fbh top three
eyeshadow palettes that is tricky to
answer well like I was saying like I
love my GBS place my color drain and my
Too Faced chocolate gold or the ones I'm
digging most right now
Shelby just finished watching what's up
in makeup I'm so glad you watched it it
was like it was a little it was like
three minutes late soon because my heart
didn't go off gas motor brushes are
awesome I have one that I adore for
foundation nice Jacqueline have you ever
heard of Tara mayor brushes no they look
like artiste brushes she got a self
hautelook for $29 Wow no I've never seen
those CD this silences real technique
brushes are amazing I think I'm catching
up to that part of the conversation
Steph says what's one thing you miss
about high school
I think the consistency of it you know
like waking up going to school like I
think that's what I miss about having
like a job' job too is like the
consistency of doing the same thing like
it's kind of I don't know I missed that
and this I don't know like I feel like
you feel like high school was like more
predictable than life now you know I
don't know I don't miss a lot though
because like you had to I there was so
much you have to deal with in high
school like as far as drama and like
friends and boyfriends and all of that
that I don't miss I miss homecoming and
going to football games that was fun
like homecoming dances like dances and
stuff that was fun I miss those
I don't necessarily miss the people of
time I list them some but like I split
off from everybody I knew in high school
when I graduated because of choices that
I made that were really bad I made some
terrible choices so that's for another
day but that was totally my fault
yes we stopped being friends and then
I've seen them a few times since and
they're very very nice people but we
don't really I don't feel like we really
have a ton in common at this point so I
don't think that if we like got together
we would be best friends not that
they're bad people they're great people
is just don't have a lot in common
anymore
Silvia which face primer do you think is
better for sensitive skin ooh I think
that would be something for the
collective brain so if you um if you
have a suggestion for primer for
sensitive skin definitely leave that in
the comments below I would have to like
look at ingredients and stuff like that
since I don't have sensitive skin I
would have to like do some more research
I want to recommend something and then
you buy it it's terrible because I just
said something off the top of my head
you know lots of people saying they like
BH Cosmetics brushes shanna what makeup
are you traveling with I'm gonna let you
know that next week I don't know what I
like you know I feel like in life it's
okay to not know a hundred percent how
you feel about something and I feel like
in today's society we're forced to pick
a side all the time you know which side
are you on you know or are you for are
you against you can't be in the middle
and I feel like it's okay to not know
and not have an opinion fully formed
because I feel like if we preemptively
form opinions about things then we don't
necessarily represent what's in our
heart so the way that I feel about I can
see both sides on like that habit and
stuff where you know there's the
artistic creativity piece where someone
has really invested a lot in the design
and the color selection and worked
really really hard for you know a year
or more you know or maybe less I don't
know on this design of this palette and
then somebody comes and they just take
all of that work they recreated at a
lower price and that's messed up I feel
like that's messed up but at the same
time from a consumers perspective not
everybody can afford a $50 I shower
palette of $45 for Dodge not everybody
can afford that so I feel like it's a
good way for people that they don't want
to
or cants spends a lot of money on an
eyeshadow they can try these color
schemes you know and that habit does a
really really good job with formula they
really really do facecam you don't feel
like this is good but bad habit does an
excellent job so it's it's getting a
similar product its opening up the
market to more people so that more
people have the opportunity try it so I
understand it from a consumers point of
view I'm for it
but from an artistic point of view I'm
against it how terrible is that I know I
but I don't I don't feel like we should
force ourselves into a box if we're not
ready to be in that box you know I just
can't take a strong stance either way I
can't because my heart doesn't have a
strong stance either way cuz I see both
sides that's just the way that I met
Emily what's one video you really want
to do but haven't yet well if I tell you
then somebody might steal my idea
there's one video that I want to do with
Christiana and Cosmetics that I've had
in my head for a while and had this
stuff to do it for a while and I haven't
done it and I told her I was like I
really really wanna do it when I get
back so I don't want to tell you there's
a lot I also have a video that I filmed
about products that I wish I could
review this summer that I won't be able
to review this summer so that'll be a
good one - that one's gonna be coming up
I think the second week is the plan the
second week that I'm gone I did already
film that I film that yesterday Monica
okay somewhat okay she's talking about
boxycharm something the palette I
haven't tried it yet I already talked
about the camera that I use it's a Canon
70d if you rewind on the replay all took
I talked about the lens and stuff trying
to find another question I love all the
stuff that you're saying and I can read
it on the replay
I do enjoy Sigma brushes Ashley the e-40
is fabulous I love the e-40 it's a
blending brush Julie says
morphe brushes are made by crown brush I
don't think that's true I honestly don't
I think they did they were at one point
made by crown brush I don't think they
are anymore
I think they've separated I think they
separated a long time ago that was the
information that I was given by a
reliable source but I don't know that
for a fact I didn't see the paperwork
with my eyes but I don't think that
they're the same company anymore but I
think at one point they were I know
they're still related somehow I think
they're family related somehow okay
Tallis sorry my contact lenses are like
blurring on me like my eyes are dry I
went to bed at like 3 o'clock in the
morning last night trying to get what
some makeup finished so I was going all
day yesterday all right help no matter
what I have trouble blending any cream
contour nicely girlfriend me too
you had lots of different shapes and
types of brushes and sponges but it
always picks up my foundation and ruins
my face I'm try it might be a lot of
people that I hear with that story use a
lot of pumps of foundation if you use a
less foundation I feel like it's less
likely to move it because there's less
to pick up because I don't have that
problem at quite as much as far as
picking up the foundation but as far as
cream bronzer a lot of times honestly
like cream highlight cream bronzer I
have it on my fingertips or a beauty
sponge I feel like that's that's you
know been the best way for me a
stippling brush can work but sometimes I
slip in bar seems to take a long time
and all of the patients so a lot of
times I'll just tap it on but the cream
cream contour products and cream bronzer
and cream highlighter and not my
favorites they're much harder to work
with much harder fbh I think that tall
moto brush is more for cut crease type
looks to get colored precisely in the
crease but I could be wrong I'm not sure
which one you were talking about but hey
you're probably right I'm probably wrong
who knows I don't know which brush
you're talking about I think you should
use but I think when it comes down to as
people should use brushes for what they
want to use them for and I think when
we're critiquing what brushes people are
using I think that's being a little bit
presumptuous
I'm not talking about you specifically
but like when you when people come to my
mic demos and they say you're using the
wrong brush you're using the wrong brush
but it's like if I want to use a certain
brush because I like the way that that
one works then I don't see why someone
should tell me I'm doing it wrong
you know people somebody could say you
might get a better result if you use it
for X purpose but to say someone's wrong
it's like telling someone they're using
the wrong I don't know I just feel like
makeup people a lot of times like to
impose their own things that work for
them on other people and I don't think
that's good you know I mean suggestions
are one thing like what you're doing is
suggesting which is not what I'm talking
about like you're amazing you're awesome
fbh you're fabulous I'm not talking
about you but I think when we're
imposing our own viewpoints and other
people in lots of different ways I think
that that's just not a good thing but
giving suggestions okay have you thought
about trying to use this this way I
think that's that's awesome
and that made sense any sense I'm going
around in circles oh my god
yeah I don't know I don't know which
brush we're talking about unfortunately
lots of brush talk
Julie other things I collect I rocks I
like rocks in this thing right here
underneath here I have a bunch of rocks
I have a gum I don't want to move it I'm
like I've got like all mine I got like
money in my amethyst a little piece of
amethyst geode and stuff
I love rocks but I'm not like an avid
collector like it's not it doesn't
consume anything but like if I go
somewhere where there's stones being
sold I'll always flip through wood see
if there's anything that I want but
other than that I don't really collect
anything except for makeup stuff that's
a good question and we never asked me
that before I don't think
on the motor brush I showed it look like
a lip brush and to find that brush I
don't think that it is what do they do
with it
and I feel like I need to find it
because now there's a couple people
talking about it I don't think it was
though cuz I don't really usually keep
lip brushes what I do with it here it is
is this it no come on I have to find it
now here we go
seems it this one no this one yes this
one right here this is pointed liner is
eyeliner brush supposedly no I would
never use this for a lighter maybe we're
smudging or a lower lashline liner this
will work good for lower lashline liner
like for shadow it can take shout out
put on your lower lashline I would never
use this for like a cream eyeliner or
anything but I feel like it's too it's
too long I don't like brushes like that
but too long I don't like brushes
they're too floppy or too long drive in
Bunker's Jen loves the y6 I know I think
I'm on my own
Tammy's anyone think the price of makeup
has become outrageous I mean I love
great makeup at dang regular people
actually need to save up just get some
new stuff I am totally with you I think
the price is insane like I went to the
drugstore like to to beef up my
drugstore makeup collections I wanted to
get some drugstore eyeshadows for a
video and I was like fifteen dollars for
like a L'Oreal quad or like it was
something like I was like $12 or $15 for
a L'Oreal quad like are you kidding me
really like what craziness I do I do
think that's outrageous
especially the drugstore stuff I always
feel like drugstore stuff shouldn't go
over like 10 to 12 dollars and like 4/10
for like 10 to 12 dollars you should be
getting like a foundation or a eyeshadow
palette like like like a 10 shade i
shadow pumping I feel like like lip
products shouldn't go over like 6 bucks
of the drugstore
I just mean I do I feel like there
that's insanely priced and high-end
stuff too like what is it like 40 38
dollars or thirty six dollars for a
highlighter it's one shade it's one
shade I totally went you tell me with
you on see oh no it skipped down I
missed a lot oh my gosh
okay it just totally skipped down so I
don't know what I just missed and I'm
just gonna go with what's current so I
apologize if I miss things so if you
type something and I didn't see it
please retype it Susan wait a minute
let's see hey Devon where are you
visiting in Canada we are going to
Vancouver um we're gonna go to Banff

gonna go to I don't know like up in that
area
Stacy wants to know if um wait yeah have
you removed the met oh my gosh excuse me
have you reviewed the magic palette no I
did not do a formal review of it but
it's the same as all the rest of my
devious place reviews probable good
they're all good
Veronica what's your tea on the Boxee
Trump upgrade I have not looked into
that because I'm not about to tribe
subscriber so I I haven't looked into it
Michelle wants know if I'm gonna try the
new color pop foundation no cuz I'm not
gonna be home Haley wants to know if
I've gotten coloured raine and target I
have not I haven't gone to my target
since it launched there so I have not
seen it Jamie I said if I mean if not
wants to know if I'm getting the Jackals
homework you've all know I want to but I
can't I'm not gonna be here no my
husband looked in the other day he was
like what do you think about moving to
Canada I like you know what Canada seems
like an amazing place but I like being
an American I don't want to be a
Canadian I was born in America I want to
be an American I want to live in America
I know our country isn't perfect we've
got our bumps we've got our things that
are not good but I still in my heart
believe in America somewhere somewhere I
am proud to be an American and I don't
want to be Canada even though Canada
seems like a very lovely place
jelena how do you feel about Jeff
restart his products I have will talk
about his products I have the I did a
full review of the first eyeshadow
palette that he released the beauty
killer palette it was excellent I
definitely felt like there was some room
for improvement and a couple of the
shades but overall I really liked them I
do have one of his blushes that was sent
to me by a subscriber and I feel like
it's very pigmented very but not overly
pigmented I really like it a lot as far
as him as a person I am NOT a fan of him
as a person and that's from the way he
presents himself in public I have never
spoken to him in person I've seen him
but I have never spoken to him so I
haven't had any personal interactions
with him so I don't know but as far as
the things that I've seen the way he's
chosen to present himself in person I
don't think that he's a good person and
I don't I'm not a fan at all at all nope
nope nope it's one of the very few
brands that I don't don't buy things
from did I say no have I tried its
trainer Jo skincare no I haven't but
that's a good idea we have a Trader
Joe's not that far from us so Barbara
says Jota has a joke over price and not
worth a penny I have a Hooda
9 pan palette and I like it it's good I
feel like it's a little bit overpriced
for how it performs I think it's a it
performs well but it's not blowing my
mind you know honey if you had to do a
full face using only one brands products
which would you choose
oh that's a good question probably to
face to be honest because I have so many
products that I love from Too Faced I
have products that I hate from do Faced
but I have products that I really love
from Too Faced that are really fun for
me to use is personally I am very big
into the scented makeup I love scented
makeup I know that there are people
there like oh my gosh like with the
Senate makeup some people can't use it
for different various reasons I love it
I find it to be very pleasant I am a
very big scent person like I like things
to smell nice so when my makeup smells
nice it makes me very happy it puts me
in a good mood so I am all for scented
that's that's me personally but I see
the other side I totally see the other
side of it that was a great question I
like that question thank you to all of
the admins for taking care of the chat
I'm seeing you all blocking a bunch of
people thank you for doing that I knew
this was gonna come up Kathy wants to
know will you be adding Kat Von D to
your list of products you don't buy you
know I was saying earlier how like some
things in my mind I see both sides now
let me explain let me say before you
kill before you jump on me and want to
want to kill me don't kill me yet okay
so as far as the Kat Von D anti-vaccine
thing I have been avoiding this question
on purpose
because I was trying to find my brain on
it and this is where I'm at now and I
want to be honest with you and I don't
think that I would be me if I didn't
tell you how I felt about this
particular situation so if I was her
friend I would try so hard to convince
her to change her mind I think what
she's doing is dangerous not just for
her child but for other people around
her child I think that it's a horrible
idea I think it just it my kids are
vaccinated my son got a mumps like a
virus when he was five I think his whole
face swelled up he is vaccinated so they
did give him a mumps test and he came
back negative for it but it looked
exactly like mumps it was every symptom
of mumps so the fact that that happened
scares me you know like I don't know if
it's related to the whole not vaccine
thing but even if it isn't to see
something like that was really creepy in
my own kid and you know to put other
kids at risk because you have you know
you want to stand on whatever moral
platform you want to stand on just it
really bothers me a lot so if I was
close to her if we were friends I would
do everything in my power to convince
her to change your mind
because I think it's a horrible idea I
do not support that choice at all but
here's the other piece of it and this is
where I get conflicted in that I don't
see that as me makeup related at all in
that like I feel like it's it's a stupid
thing to do but I don't think that
makes her a bad person I think that
makes her a person that isn't educated
maybe maybe ignorant would be a good
word to use but I don't see that as
being the same as like Jeffrey star and
the things that he's done where he just
looks like a horrible person to me just
it just makes me nauseous in my stomach
some of the things that he has done and
continues to do and not just this past
but things he continues to do I just
don't agree with him and this is just
for me personally you know I mean
everyone has to find their line in the
sand but the the anti-vaccine it's legal
for her not to vaccinate her child it's
legal so she's not breaking the law
she's doing what she feels like is right
for her baby and as a mom I feel like I
I don't have a right to tell other moms
what's best for their babies you know
what I mean I wouldn't want anybody to
come and tell me what's best for my baby
and I don't want to feel like I need to
tell her what's best for her baby where
it crosses the line is she's not just
putting her baby in jeopardy she's
putting other people in jeopardy that's
where it's hard but I don't see that as
a deal breaker as far as makeup goes at
this point but I'm not buying anything
for a while so there's definitely room
for me to change my mind before I buy
another Kat Von D product so I'm not
like saying yes I'll buy her products
you know but right now I'm leaning
toward continuing to purchase her
products
but very very reluctantly and it's only
because I feel like you know it's just
it's so not makeup related you know I
don't know it seemed like my brains
going like do you ever like have a
thought in your head in your brain pulls
you this way and then it pulls you this
way and it pulls you this way I'm still
in that weird like brain phase where I'm
like I'm not even sure what I'm gonna do
about this you know because if it was
only her child it was affecting then I
would be like that's her baby let her do
what she wants with her baby but the
fact that could affect other kids and
other people that's where that's where
it gets me as being that's really bad
it's really really bad so I don't know
as of now I'm not boycotting but I'm not
buying anything for a while so I have I
have
time to change my mind if I decide that
I want to change my mind and buy
something and not buy something in the
future I don't know I'm still in a weird
head space about it I haven't I'm still
kind of going back and forth but but
again right now I'm not buying anything
from anybody so doesn't even matter but
but yeah so that's where I stand on it
and I was kind of nervous to talk to you
about it because I know that people have
really really strong opinions about it
but I have to tell you from my heart how
I feel and you know my first instinct
was like it's her baby it's not my baby
that was my first instinct but then the
fact that it affects other people that's
where it that's what bothers me so
that's where I'm at
let me go ahead and squid scroll down
and see what the communities saying
because it's important to me to see what
you guys are saying about this stuff
Julie says I don't think I need any
sherry shows to social media in the
world
I'm scared people are going to follow
just because she said it and that was
the way to be yeah and I think it's a
more popular thing where she lives in
California it's more popular to not
vaccinate your kids so I think it's part
of her community as well but yeah I see
what you're saying but I'm hoping that
the backlash against it has made people
like think a little bit more about it Oh
crystal Oh it's crystal you need to
check out it's crystals Channel she's
amazing she said my question is how do
you manage to be so talented equally
kind crystal that means so much to me I
honestly don't find myself to be
talented in in makeup stuff at all so
the fact that a professional makeup
artist said that to me is kind of making
me freak out a little bit I think that's
who may thank you um I think as far as
the kindness I don't know
I have good parents ya know I try to be
kind I'm not I'm not perfect only
anybody is perfect I've made mistakes
I've done things on they were unkind but
I think it's really important to just
really think about your affect on other
people you know I think that's important
I think that we lose sometimes the fact
that when we say something it affects
other people you know that every action
we do in public you know not only
represents ourselves but actually
affects people so
that was really nice of you crystal
you're very sweet
it's crystal on YouTube she's beautiful
and very very talented talk about talent
Emily um if you want to do that in your
private life whatever the fact that she
just had to announce the world is
annoying yeah I mean I think that I
don't know I
I'm very as this person is very very
transparent and I like to share things
with the world it's hard for me to tell
someone that they shouldn't have shared
something that was Pat they're
passionate about with the world but I
see that point of view I totally see
that point of view Amy I think vaccines
are important some people like me can't
get vaccines because of negative
reactions yeah and I think that needs to
be researched and talked to doctors and
things like that but I think that unless
there's some specific very very specific
reason not to I think it's very very
important I remember my doctor asking me
with both of my kids so are you gonna do
vaccines I'm like yes and like oh thank
god should I go good I guess everyone's
emotion gets people that don't
beautification ritual my thought exactly
KVD need to do further discussions wait
needs to further discussion she's having
the safety of many outweighs the safety
of a few yeah and I mean like I think it
might be the whole vegan like
cruelty-free thing because the vaccines
aren't cruelty-free most of them I don't
think from what I understand something
that might be part of it they may not be
vegan which might be part of it I would
imagine it would be a lot of that but I
did hear something about you know the
whole autism thing that maybe she could
believe that but I don't know I don't
know what why should what her reasoning
is I think she's probably said what her
reasoning is I know she said something
about medical there's a medical reason
and I don't know Missy says they won't
allow kids in our disco district and
they aren't vaccinated you have to be
homeschooled Wow I mean it's a good
point it's a good point Rebecca says
what she does is her business but I have
a problem with her pushing her position
on such a large platform she's always
been pushy like for as long as I've been
following Kat Von D and social media
she's always in pushy about her
viewpoints she had a quietly parented
her child the way she sees fit that
true that's true but she's always been
very vocal I don't know if she's well
she has been kind of pushy and that she
she kind of almost lays a guilt trip on
people that don't feel the same as her
which I don't agree with the ABF having
a newborn put at risk with a huge scare
during the measles outbreak by an
anti-vaxxer later became educated and
changed your tune Wow okay subculture
butterfly it doesn't just put people at
risk as influencing her followers to do
the same it's exponential that's a good
point that's a really really good point
it is but I'm hoping I don't know I mean
it's hard to see like what the reach
actually is of what she says you know
Melinda says my daughter's a doctor and
it's in no way she would not vaccinate
my precious granddaughters yeah and I
think that if you know when you're
trying to live in all natural kind of
life and then you talk about something
called vaccines which are not natural
but death is natural you know and I
personally don't want my kids to die any
earlier than then is necessary oh I'd
much rather than be around at any
advantage I can give them to having a
longer happier healthier life I think is
better so hmm chair says I think she may
very unkind of people who disagree with
her I can I've seen that to her being
very extremely defensive 70 says I think
maybe Piermont said that Catelyn do you
like to see yourself as an outsider she
almost puts herself in a position to be
misunderstood sometimes yeah I think so
I think sometimes I think she you know
it's there are some people that enjoy
that shock value that enjoy that I'm
gonna be different and I'm gonna show
people that I'm different and I think
she's one of those people which isn't
necessarily a bad thing
my husband's one of those people that
likes to do things well at least when he
was younger not as much now but when he
was younger
I like to do things that were shocking
you know but you know I don't know I
think that when it affects other people
that's when I have a problem you know
what you do in your own life in your own
space I have no property just do
do your own thing you do you but when
you're gonna hurt somebody else because
of it that's when I have an issue
I'll keep skipping down Susan says
interesting what not make up behaviors
drive people to support or not support a
brand I agree and I think there's so
many things there's so many reasons to
not support different brands I mean I
feel like there's got to be skeletons in
every brands closet it's just some of
them are public and some of them aren't
you know misty says child service is
also called if you don't vaccinate
really all right yeah new topic I agree
Michelle I'm with you let's talk about
something different totally with you
Michelle thank you
okay karen says would love to take a big
road trip what's been your favorite
place to visit so far and what are you
looking forward to on this one okay
outside the United States we really
loved Iceland Iceland was amazing
we absolutely loved it it was beautiful
very expensive to eat out but very
beautiful
we loved Iceland we love the people
there as far as inside the United States
I would say Yellowstone was amazing
spending the week in Yellowstone there's
so much cool stuff in Yellowstone
I definitely recommend a trip to
Yellowstone and Grand Teton that was
that was incredible but we're being
nature people so that was big nature so
I would say as far as like museums and
like indoor things the Indianapolis
Children's Museum was incredible that
was the coolest place I think we went as
far as like indoor places that I can
think up all the top of my head you know
all the exhibits I'm a big dinosaur
person on if you know this about me if
you've been around a while you know my
love for dinosaurs but they have a
really really cool dinosaur exhibit at
the Indianapolis Children's Museum so we
did that and it was super cool I
definitely recommend checking that out
so that would say those are those are
kind of the ones that stand out in my
mind right now
happy Savi how do you feel about Oprah's
rebrand unfortunate foreign hashtag and
the whole Twitter thing you know I
didn't really the only way I knew about
that was from you because you tag me in
it savvy about the Oprah
bran there's like a thing on okay
there's all over highlighter and I can't
remember what Savi might be able to tell
us they it was like labeled is $100 for
this highlighter and it had like a
hashtag that was named after somebody
from the company but it actually was
something if you look it up on urban
dictionary it's something that you
wouldn't want to say in front of
children let's just leave it there so I
think that they changed it they tweaked
it so it wasn't that it's a little
slightly different now I think a hundred
dollars for highlighter is insane I
can't imagine any reason why anybody
would pay $100 for a highlighter I think
that's crazy but yeah I I don't know I
don't know what's going on you're the
only reason why I know about that that's
from you so Ashley says will you ever
get any tattoos if so what will it be I
have a bunch of tattoos I have like
eight or nine tattoos they're all on my
back except for I have one on my ankle I
have the little wedding couple that was
on our wedding invitations on my ankle
and then I have a bunch of fairytale
movie themed stuff on my back I've got
the neverending story I've got Falkor
with fashion running Falkor my shoulder
and then I have the owl from labyrinth
is here
I don't want to show you because they're
like kind of old and they don't look as
good as they once did but they look
really good when I got him though I have
a giant mermaid on my back for the
Little Mermaid I have on my lower hip I
have Alice Oh No kind of like in the
middle I have an Alice in Wonderland's
tattoo where she's you know the original
Lewis Carroll drawing where she's
opening up the little the curtain to
reveal the little door I have that kind
of in the middle of my back on my hip I
have the C prints in the fire child it's
an anime movie that I loved when I was a
kid so I had the C prints in water he's
like looking up out of the water on my
hip I was gonna do a whole back piece
but tattoos hurt so I haven't Chris
tattoos hurt so that's kind of the
rundown of my tattoos I'm trying to give
him oh and I have a mask a theater mask
that I got that was my first tattoo it's
on the the curtain of Alice on alice's
curtain it's like it looks supposed to
look like it's hanging on Alice's
curtain that was very personal to me
when I got it there's a lot of
representation in that I got that one
when I was like 20
my first tattoo that was the only one
that John didn't do John did all the
rest of them if I was gonna get any more
though I probably finished my back piece
and then I was I thought about getting
one of John's mandalas because I think
they're gorgeous
so I really like to finish this to
finish my backpiece or get one of John's
mandalas but I don't know where I would
get one of John's mandalas he wants to
do what a big one on my hip cuz he
thinks those are really pretty but man
that's the hurt I don't like getting
tattooed I hate it oh is it your web
page says I don't remember your drive
but if you go to Rochester New York God
now we're not going there go to the
Museum of play good to know mental note
for future we're not going that way
we're shooting straight across and then
watch me hit Colorado that's when we're
going up Tina says bye papa Lux
highlighters they're awesome I love my
pop looks highlighters I have two of
them I have black ice and then I have
the peach one that shifts I really do
like them very much they're very odd
though like they're they're pressed
really weird like they're there in my my
monthly favorites from last month
they're the especially the black ice one
it doesn't even feel like a highlighter
like it's super super smooth doesn't
have any kick up at all it's a really
weird formula but it's gorgeous got like
that wet look on the cheek it's really
pretty like almost like a whiter version
of the Emery's highlighter Valerie did
you ever buy makeup just for yourself
with no intention of reviewing it for
your channel no not anymore
not really no everything i buy kind of
has to be for the channel because I have
so much stuff that it's like I already
get overwhelmed with how much of I
really want to do with decluttering the
spring and it just never happened
because I've just got too much stuff
it's it's overwhelming and it stresses
me out so I don't buy things that I do
I'm not gonna review on the channel I
don't think everything I buy I have an
intention of reviewing on the channel
does it ever does it all happen now
Michelle would you let your kids get a
tattoo before they were 18 I would
strongly discourage it but I can't say
no because I don't know them as
seventeen year olds and 16 year olds I
don't know them at that age yet
but I'm not a fan of that idea
at all because when if I was that age I
would have a big Tweety Bird on me and
that would but that would have been a
bad choice and I'm very thankful that
when I was like 19 20 I did not get a
tattoo and that was even 18 at that
point on a 18 I probably would have
gotten because I was 17 18 I was really
really religious so I probably would
have gotten some kind of Christian
tattoo if I was doing that at that age
yeah I'll leave that there because I
don't want to go into that story I was
not a positive transition out of my life
and it's nothing against Christians it
was just a personal experience that I
had was not good
well you know but I want to get into
that story today that's a that's a story
Tami how many times do you really think
you're going to do your makeup all on
vacation I rarely do mine unless I'm
going out to a nice dinner that's
probably what I'm going to do it I'm
Claude Lee collaboration plan so I'll
definitely do it then when we're just
going on on a regular day I probably
won't but if we're planning something
nice I definitely will I'm like I'm
bringing my hair extensions I'm bringing
you know everything I need to dress up
nice I think it's nice my husband likes
it when I dress up too so traces I swear
the comment feed is so far ahead of the
video it probably is because the comment
feed goes so fast I pause it so that way
I can actually read it because it's it's
flying too fast I can't read it all
right I'm gonna stay on an extra few
minutes because I feel like I want to so
I'm gonna stay on like an extra couple
of minutes I want to I'm gonna hang out
a little bit longer this was Chad I'm
gonna miss you Susan my son got 1 3
weeks ago before 18 his birthday present
he told me he would get a mom tat with
my date of birth and a - she was
prepared what I did so ok that's what
that is what I live with
ah gotcha think I understand yes I think
Julie are you taking food with you
living the sandwich life on the road no
we have a kitchen we have a full kitchen
so we have a refrigerator in a kitchen
so we are taking some food initially but
for the most part we're gonna be doing
grocery shopping maybe cooking in the in
the adventure man we have a cooking
system that you didn't see in the video
because we hadn't purchased it yet but
we have like a hot plate system there's
no microwave my dad was trying to
convince me to get a microwave but we're
not microwave people so we're doing like
a hot plate kind of situation we're
gonna paint we have like pans and you
know small pans and and pots and all
that stuff to cook simple meals but I
like I like to cook so we all have a
refrigerator and we're just going to be
grocery shopping but we do have some of
those REI the dehydrated meals those
things are
really really good if you ever going
camping and you need food like those
dehydrated meals from REI are incredible
they're so good you would never know
they're dehydrated you just boil water
and you pour it in and you stir it up
and you let it sit and it's they're
really really good so we have some of
those for firmer emergency situations
and then we'll have lunch food like like
what you're saying we'll have like
sandwich food and all that but we're
gonna try really hard to do as much of
that as we can because it's so much
cheaper than going out to eat all the
time but yeah yeah no oven no oven on
the adventure man vantur CJ you can see
that in my announcement video I have an
important announcement something like
that is linked under this week's what's
up and make up we're just go to the
channel but it's like important channel
information video you'll see the tour
the adventure man it's really cool but
yeah there's no there's no oven and the
adventure man we can't fit that in there
but we will have like a little stovetop
situation Michelle wants to know if I'm
gonna vlog on the trip probably not
because it's a lot of work to vlog and I
really want to focus on my family and
spending time with them as much as
possible but I do want to do some live
streams so I'm just impromptu live
stream so keep an eye out for those when
we do have we do have minutes and I'm
gonna give you updates and then also the
community tab on YouTube I want to
update that pretty often I do have to
have internet Wi-Fi on my computer to
update the community tab so it's not
gonna be all the time but I want to
update it as much as I can because I
feel like it's just a great platform to
to keep you updated and there's a lot of
engagement over there the way you find
the community tab I talked about this in
the announcement video is you can go on
youtube to my channel page and click on
community but you have to like take the
time to remember to do that or if you go
on your phone when I post something and
you go to your main page on YouTube on
your phone it should be right there
along with your suggested videos it
should be there anything that I post so
I'm but I'm not gonna do a vlog like I
normally do I never finished those
anyway I finished I got through like 3/4
of my Iceland trip and like I got all
the way through our summer trip two
years ago except for the last video I
didn't put that up but links to those
are also on the announcement video if
you want to see my past vlog videos they
don't do very well in the channel either
or like I felt like the engagement
wasn't very good on it and they there's
so much work to do I know there's a
select you know hardcore people that
will watch them but they're just so much
work FBI she has just make home movies
for yourself yeah we're gonna take
videos on like our phones and stuff for
ourselves definitely it's a good idea
and then just kind of edited into one
thing when we get home just for our
personal memories yeah I'm really
looking forward to it
Nicole is here who I'm gonna also see on
my trip from yea or nay Nicole
definitely check out her YouTube channel
we told our kids that we won't pay for
college if they get a tattoo before they
graduate wait some plans to get one when
he graduates but at least it'll be older
if he chooses more wisely yeah I hear
that and I think every parent needs to
make their own choices as far as tattoos
for their kids my husband got his first
tattoo when I think he was 14 his dad
actually took him to a friend's house
and his friend tattooed a skull on his
arm when he was like 14 years old my
husband's father was a very unique guy
he was very funny he was a biker very
funny
great personality as far as his sense of
humor but definitely some some
interesting parenting choices taking his
son to get this fiery skull but John
ended up getting it covered up so he
doesn't have it anymore no we does it he
got it brightened it's still there it's
just brightened and it's kind of its
kind of incorporated into other tattoos
but uh but yeah he actually found a
picture not that long ago a few weeks
ago he found a picture of him actually
getting tattooed at the Sky's house and
he's this kid getting this tattoo on his
arm it's crazy it's absolutely crazy I
would not be in support of that at all
and I am I definitely do not encourage
kids to get tattoos I honestly feel like
25 it's probably a better age but
everybody's different too you know
everybody has a different level of
maturity and awareness and all of that
too so it's a it's an individual
person's decision but just really having
in your head that this is something it's
gonna be on your body forever and you
should only ever get a tattoo because
you want it not because someone else you
think want to impress people or because
you know you think it's cool or you pick
something off a wall it's forever man
so making those decisions is really
important there's no eraser you know you
can get it some some of them you can get
removed but it's extremely painful is
extremely expensive and a lot of times
they don't remove completely so you
can't get a tattoo it's not like you
know wetting people sometimes will get
married thinking oh I'll just get a
divorce if it doesn't work out which i
think is also horrible but at least
that's done if getting a tattoo like
even the removal process like can't get
a tattoo thinking you're gonna get it
removed eventually it's a horrible
horrible horrible idea if anybody ever
says I don't don't let them do that even
give them information that's terrible
will tell them to look that up
alright I should probably go cuz it's
