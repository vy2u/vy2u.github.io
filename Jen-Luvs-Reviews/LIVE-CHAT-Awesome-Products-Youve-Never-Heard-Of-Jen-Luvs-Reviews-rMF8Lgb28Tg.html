those are you there you're in live chat
thank you so much for being here I
apologize for the delay for whatever
reason my alarm didn't go off
I didn't double-check why my alarm
didn't go off but it should have I have
it set to automatically go off maybe it
went off and I just was sleeping too
hard I don't know but I usually wake up
about 8:30 and get everything ready I
had a plan today we were gonna declutter
my highlighters because my highlighter
drawer is overflowing it's insane and so
I woke up late and I started pulling out
my highlighters and I started feeling a
little nauseous because I was like so I
started getting it not literally
emotional like I wasn't actually getting
emotional but I was like no we're not
we're not decluttering this day so I had
to switch gears and I was like what am I
gonna do what am I gonna do what am I
gonna do and I was like you know why I
have so many products that I've used and
tried that like I feel like nobody
really talks about that I thought would
be really fun to talk about and show you
some of these things if you're a
religious watcher on my channel you will
probably have seen some of this stuff
before probably most of it before but I
kind of like side mention them in chats
and you know maybe mention them a year
ago like that kind of stuff so I haven't
brought them to the front of my channel
in a while and some of them a couple of
things I haven't talked like yeah a
couple of things I haven't talked about
at all so I thought that would be a
really fun topics that's why it took me
so long to get here is because I was
like scrambling to get all of my stuff
and making sure that I knew what I was
talking about making sure I was a
hundred percent behind the products and
it just takes a minute so now that I've
rambled on for a minute and a half
thank you guys so much for being here I
don't know what's going on with my
lighting I'll put my face up a little
bit closer my kit should be working now
last chat I forgot to double check to
make sure that my computer was using my
mic it ended up using my computer mic
instead of this mic and hopefully you
guys can hear me better so I'm going to
go ahead and say hello to the people
that are here alive in the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness when I start
showing products if you're watching this
on the replay that's what I'm talking
about products will probably be like
another minute or so so I but when I
invite people into my home I do like to
say hello to them so
and some of them have been here for a
good 20 minutes so Julie is here hello
latina and Julio down by the schoolyard
er here she says great morning whenever
you're on we love you and yours love you
back Julio and latina amber is here
and Julie was the first one year
great job Julie I wish I was here with
you I'm sorry Aspen is here good morning
my friend Valerie so you can see I have
a full cup of coffee because that's how
much I've had time to drink Valerie and
Brook and Teresa M oh hello good morning
to you coffee plus live chat is a
wonderful Sunday thank you so much I'm
happy to be here with you I think I
already said hi to amber yes I did and
Cheyenne is here good morning my friend
AJ is here good morning my friend I love
seeing a lot of the same people coming
back and people that I feel like I'm
getting to know it's wonderful to see
the same people it's wonderful to see
new people as well this is just such a
cool format I love it
Abby is here AJ says good morning all
from a deer stand on Lake Superior in
North Minnesota that's so cool and if I
didn't say hello to you hello to you and
thank you so much for being here I'm
gonna go I scroll down too far okay
we're three minutes in let's get started
with some products who are commenting on
like dinosaur sweatshirt you may not
know this about me but I love dinosaurs
I'm not quite as into it as I was when I
bought this sweatshirt but I still
really love dinosaurs I love anything
that's old rocks dinosaurs anything like
that so yes good stuff alright so let's
go ahead and start with the base up so
let's start with face primers this is
one that used to be one that I talked
about a lot oh no of course the stream
looks like it's kind of in and out okay
this is the Mirabella primer this is the
face primer this is a brand that I don't
really hear about it all anymore this
was given in a subscription box I think
it was boxycharm awhile back but this is
almost exactly the same for me as the
smashbox photo photo-ready the the white
the clear wine the clearish one it's
very silicone based it works very very
well I really love this product it just
looks like this and if you like silicone
based primers and you're looking for
something different I would def
recommend getting this it is very
smoothly go on it feels really good on
the skin and I really like it a lot a
lot of these things you're not going to
be able to find at Sephora or Ulta
that's kind of the point of this so you
may want to check on the individual
websites for the brands aisle but try to
be very clear as far as what the name of
the brand is this is Mir a de L LA and I
have liked what a few products from this
brand I primer let's talk about this one
this is the Miran s eye primer I use
this a lot in my getting ready with me
for what's up and makeup I do go on
periscope if you're not familiar with
periscope it is a I'm gonna clean my
glasses
it's a Twitter app that is a live
streaming app it's kind of like you now
but I don't think there's there is a pay
section to it but my account is not
enabled for that but other than that it
seems a lot like you now if you've ever
done that but periscopes really cool
except for the creepers other than that
but we've got a nice little group of
like 20 or 30 of us that get ready for
what's up and makeup if you ever want to
watch the replay of that you can go over
to my Twitter and it automatically feeds
to my Twitter but anyway I use this eye
primer a lot it's one of those that
mutes out discoloration you show you
it's more liquidy than the then like the
Urban Decay primer and Eden and it's
very very nice I really like this by
primer a lot let me show you so that's
an eye primer it's thinner like if
you're used to using like maybe a
concealer or something to mewn out
discoloration this is a thinner one so I
personally like this better than like
tart shake tape or something to prime my
eyelids because I feel like it works
more effectively as a primer but it
doesn't cover quite as much you can see
my freckle hopefully you'll be able to
see my freckle there Aspen says
periscope with Jen is so fun sad I've
missed it lately periscope Aspen showed
up quite a few times to that and yeah it
is fun it is a lot of fun and I usually
go a little deeper into my opinions on
things because it is a smaller group I'm
usually a little more forthcoming of
opinion so it is not drying Cheryl at
all she wanted to know if this was
drying it is not drying at all it is
very smooth it's very wet feeling but I
do not find it to be drying I do have
normal skin so I'm not particularly
sensitive to it
so I have it but I haven't experienced
any feeling of drying this like if you
use like a Mac Paint Pot sometimes those
can feel a little drying
I've heard people say the Tarte shaped
ape feel a little drawing on them this
I've never heard of that and it
definitely feels different it's not as
thick you know what I mean the eye
primer is by a brand called mirin s Mir
en es se and it's called the sexy secret
eye primer and it's the packaging is
beautiful too
their foundation is very nice but it's
really really really pricey it's kind of
ridiculous and you can call you can find
this on HauteLook sometimes that's when
I picked it up for a like I think it was
like 40% off something like a 40 or 50
percent off but it's very good I really
like that a lot
all right let's see what everybody's
saying yeah Cheryl Michelle says is that
Cheryl Hawn and they go back yep Cheryl
says thanks I've dry eyelids max2 drying
for me yeah that is definitely a lot you
know it's got a lot more seems like it
has more of a water content than the Mac
the Mac is very thick AJ wants to know
if I like the Urban Decay anti-aging yes
I do I like it very much very very much
and she'll says I love her look me too
I'm a big hautelook fan all right I've
got a couple of I've got three different
foundation ish kinds of things and let's
start with the most obscure this is the
radiant skin CC cream by a brand called
clay CLE and this is a Korean product I
forget where I got this from I want to
say maybe with points from Ipsy this
stuff is awesome
it's fabulous it is a Shiseido brand I
put it on my hand a little bit so you
can see it's one of those that comes out
white and then when you when you blend
it in I don't believe that it actually
matches to your skin tone I think that's
kind of ridiculous and this is the shade
light by the way but it does kind of
turn you see that see how it kind of
turns but it's a beautiful finish
beautiful beautiful finish Melissa
wishes this we could post pictures on
here I wish you could too Sarah says I
love the Milani eye primer that is a
very good one Maddy says she just
subscribed thank you so much randy says
the Urban Decay anti-aging is very
moisturizing I'm so glad you've had that
experience that's awesome Katherine
hey Catherine I haven't seen Catherine
down here in forever I'm needing some
new foundation I'm going to have to
declutter my products yeah Allison wants
to know if they're cruelty free I would
imagine if they are a Saito brand than
know some of the Korean brands are
becoming cruelty free but your Sato
brands I don't believe are cruelty free
okay so there is a little bit of a scent
to it it's got kind of a little bit of a
sunscreen ISA just so you know hold on a
second I do have some other options
though for you I think that this I if
you ask me if these are cruelty free
honestly most of them I'm probably not
going to be able to tell you because I'd
have to look it up but I will be clear
in the name of the brand so you can look
it up okay I've got two more foundations
for you this is another Korean one this
is one if you've been on my periscope
you know how much I love this one this
is the sweet cotton poor cover BB cream
in soft beige one problem with these
Korean products is they are not women of
color friendly at all which I'm really
sorry to say I do have one that's a
little bit more women of color friendly
a little bit a little bit but I'm sorry
that these aren't I wish that they would
when they start marketing the US I wish
they would expand their color range and
hopefully they will I am now in contact
with Holika Holika which is the brand
that does this so I will put that in a
subject in the suggestion box but this
one is fabulous this is it smells a
little bit of like sweetness of like
cotton candy it smells really really
good
and well not super good I can't say it
smells really really good but it's got a
little bit of a sweetness to it I really
like it this one is a little bit thicker
than the Clare one see how it's a little
thick but the finish on this is so
beautiful it's got this beautiful satiny
finish which is my personal preference
and I really really like it a lot
um this one I got off of Amazon the
Clare one I got from from Ipsy so I'm
not sure where that one where you can
get that one I would imagine you just
bugle Clee is the name of the brand this
one is Holika Holika hol ika hol ika
this one is really really good if you
can find your shade I think there's only
like two or three shades which is
terrible but I mean I guess you know
when you're marketing to a Korean
audience there are only a few
that they need to create but when you're
marketing to an American audience I wish
that they would increase that all right
moving on I'm looking Oh epifanio says
Innisfree has women of color friend a
friendly products that is awesome thank
you so much for that I appreciate it
youko wants to know if Emily knows that
I cried in my video I don't know I
didn't talk to her about it no idea she
has not commented to me that she has
watched the video so I don't know but I
would rather her not know that's
possible because it's a little cheesy
and I don't like the fangirl I think III
really would rather not fangirl and I
didn't straight-up cry I just got a
little weepy this one is the thickest
foundation I have for you this is the
ultra Demi matte foundation I did do a
video with the olds uh with the Ulta
foundation and oh it was like an altar
hole and what I did was I just tried out
and told you which ultra bright products
were good and which ones were not good
this was one of my favorite things that
I tried this is a very thick foundation
but it comes out to a nice solid medium
coverage it's beautiful it's it's a
beautiful finish lasts all day does not
kick up around my nose or anything this
is in the shade beige and it matches me
perfectly let me show you how thick it
is it's really thick it's really really
good Lisa says my last video was awesome
thank you so much this one has a lot of
dimethicone in it though so just so you
know amber says good morning from
Marilyn hello neighbor but you can see
how dimethicone hopefully you can see
how dimethicone e that is but it feels
really good on the skin if you like that
feeling and the lasting power is really
good hopefully I held my hand up there
still enough I'm getting better I'm
trying to get better at this
there you go Melissa wants to know when
we can get him meet up at Ulta I don't
know man meetups freak me out I don't
know I feel like there's gonna be like
good people but then there's gonna be
like somebody that's going to
you like creepy you know like you never
know who's gonna show up to meetups and
that's why I like all the big people
when they do meetups they oh my gosh
hold on a second sorry okay we're going
to the movies with a friend and she's
about to buy tickets and I'm telling her
don't like tickets sorry I don't want to
buy tickets cuz we already bought her
okay sorry
alright what was I talking about I lost
because she's like are these seats next
to you like no don't buy them we already
bought them for you no okay hopefully
she got that before she bought it all
right anyway Oh what was I talking about
sorry I'm a mess oh the meetup the
meetup thing freaks me out
we're gonna go see wonder we we I did do
a bunch of meetups when we did our road
trip I guess it was not this past summer
but the summer before and I had a great
time I loved meeting the people that I
got a chance to meet but my car got
broken into in Indianapolis and every
time I was so nervous that like there
was gonna be a creeper show up you know
what I mean so it's just like you know
the big youtubers they have bodyguards
and things there to like help them but I
get scared man and I don't know I should
do a Marilyn mean up and just like you
know get some my husband's friends to
show up just in case or something I
don't know cuz I know that probably
nothing's gonna happen but it just
freaks me out all right but anyway
that's off topic Oh Cheryl says about
wonder that it looks really good yes I
used to teach that book when I taught
fourth grade I read I read did it for
two years in a row when I did fourth
grade so it's a very special book to me
all right moving on oh my gosh I'm soft
topics sorry guys okay if you're
watching this on the replay I sincerely
apologize let's keep moving okay let's
go to what should we do next let's do
brows this is what I've talked about
very briefly this is the Miss adoro
brow pencil brow pomade this stuff is so
super fab and it's really
expensive its mi SS ad Oro and it is
really really good
it reminds me a lot of the Anastacio one
but it's I find this one to be a little
bit easier to work with it's really good
I don't like it quite as much as my
benefit and the think I have the benefit
right here I do how weird is it that I
know on the floor where this is this is
the one this is actually my favorite
this is the benefit Cabral this one I
like a little bit more but this one is
about maybe a third of the price and you
get more product it's really good I have
the shade
brown brown and it's fabulous it's just
very creamy very easy to use and it's
very inexpensive so I definitely
recommend this they gave this to me when
I was at IMATS it was just I just walked
up to different brands and I introduced
myself and they're like oh let me let
you try some of our products and I
definitely recommend this this one's
really really good they're their brow
highlighting crayon isn't as good as the
benefit either but this one's much
closer of a dupe to the high-end stuff
than the brow crayon is Shea wants to
know what brush do you use what's your
favorite brushes I use very inexpensive
brushes I do not feel I don't know maybe
this is why my makeup skills aren't that
great I mean I'm okay but you know I
don't use a lot of really expensive
brushes I don't know I I just I like my
motor brushes I like my Real Techniques
brushes I like my Luxy brushes that's
kind of as high-end as I go is Luxy
brushes which are you know kind of
mid-range prices I love my Luxy brushes
but motor brushes are probably my go-to
just because I find them to be extremely
effective for the price point so mota
does send me a lot of their brushes
though just that in full disclaimer but
I do really really really like them
really like them a lot alright uh let's
see but I don't have any like brushes
that oh wait you know what I could tell
you about beauty junkie brushes that
would be a way I could stay on topic
beauty junkies is a brand that used to
send they sent me a bunch of their
brushes a long time ago they're really
really really good you can get them on
Amazon if you type in beauty junkies but
they're not like a cream
the Amazon brand they're just like a
brand that they go through Amazon to
sell a lot of their stuff and it's
easier to buy through Amazon that it is
to buy through their website they're
really really good I think it's spelled
let me look it up beauty junkies on
Amazon there they're excellent brushes
they are some of them are I would tell
you exact dupes for the Sigma ones I did
buy a Sigma holiday set was it a year
ago two years ago and I put them
head-to-head against the beauty junkies
ones exact dupes exactly it's the only
differences the ferrule has like one
more pinch on it or something and one of
them and versus the other that's like
the only difference they're exactly the
same okay it's beauty and then junkies
is Ju NK EES and they have their eight
piece brush set and case for 24 1997
2497 the sponges break on me I
definitely wouldn't recommend the
sponges they wear out and break they're
very soft but they don't last very long
the face brush set the premium
contouring and highlighting kit is 2197
it does come with the brought with a
sponge I don't have that set that one I
don't have the one that I have is the
kabuki makeup brush set it's a five
piece set includes a foundation blush
bronzer concealer and mineral brush and
mineral brushes that's weird it's 1997
that's the one that I have so I have
that set and then I have the eye brush
set and they're fabulous
I do have their Beauty sponge set I
found that the colored ones seem to last
longer than the black ones that they
sent me a bag of the colored ones and I
do like those a lot but don't get the
black one because it rips like as you
use it more so I wouldn't recommend that
Tiffany says oh hi Tiffany dawn the
beauty junkies brushes are really good I
only had a problem with one brush that's
awesome I've heard other people say that
their beauty junkie brushes fell apart
on them and then when I talked to them
was like have you been drying your
brushes with the width of ferrule with
the brush facing up and they were like
yeah and I was like well that's why they
messed up because you have to dry your
when you clean your brushes you have to
dry it with a brush facing downward with
the fluffy part facing downward or I'll
soup can grow in your brush so it was
like don't blame that on the
Raja's man you kind of got a drum that
way yeah and Nell says I tried the
beauty junkie sponges and they left bits
of sponge all over my face from the
first youth was that the black one
because the black one I completely agree
with you the color ones worked fine for
me Susan says don't hate me hate me i'm
anti morphe brush person tried twice
once that fell apart yeah I've had the
exact same I will not hate you Susan I
will agree with you I have not had good
luck with morphe brushes like I I you
know people can not like me if they want
all I have to tell you my experience
with with morphe stuff I'm so off topic
oh my gosh if you're watching this on
the replay I'm a terrible person I'm
very sorry but I want to talk about this
for a second so morphe there's one
product that i like from morphe that
i've tried and that's the Jaclyn hill
palette I don't like the 35 OS I don't
like the 3500 M I don't like another
palette that I got from them I just find
them to be mediocre they're not bad
they're just okay and for all the hype
they get of being amazing I don't see it
I don't see the amazing hype I like them
I think they're good for the value of
them like if they you know for the price
of them I think they're a good price but
I don't think they're as good as my
high-end except for the Jaclyn hill
palette the Jaclyn hill palette is
amazing and then the brushes I have
never gotten a good brush from morphe
like I've gotten like their sets though
like the cheap ones they're like the
sets off hautelook and stuff so I don't
know if it's just the ones that I've
purchased that have been terrible but I
don't plan on purchasing anything from
morphe unless it's that Jacqueline hole
formula if it's the Jacqueline home
formula then I will definitely purchase
it and try it but that the 3500 and 35 M
and 35 s so 35 P qmz I am not buying any
of them because I know that I'm not
gonna like it that much it's not worth
it to me and I said that stephannie Cole
when she looked at when I showed the
Jacqueline Hill palette I know and it's
so funny because Stephanie and I hung
out for like an hour and a half before
we started filming and that's why I feel
like we were so like in sync when we
filmed because we'd already been hanging
out for like an hour and a half and she
knew that I had it and we had talked a
little bit about morphe before you know
we started and I was like you know I
just she cuz she gets it Steph gets it
you know that I was talking about things
that like
when Malini liked and it doesn't matter
the name on it it's just I have to talk
about the things that really fit that
for me and it wasn't about that I was at
Steph's house it was about that I that
was what I believed in you know what I
mean so she gets it because she's very
honest so she gets it and but I did feel
a little like I was bringing in you know
you know something satanic into a church
I mean like I'm bringing this morphe
palette into Steph's house it was like
am I gonna catch on fire it's not good
but um but she was totally understanding
Stephanie is so flippin cool she's very
cool if we live closer we definitely
hang out alright let's get back to the
video I'll put a time stain I should put
timestamps down in the description box
after this video after I go to the
movies for my kids because I am so
off-topic alright let's move on let's
talk about these products I am planning
on doing my Q&amp;amp;A so I'll talk about some
stuff during my Q&amp;amp;A too when I do that I
where we gonna go next let's go to
eyeshadow okay so these right here my
friend um Wendy she has a YouTube
channel called diva makeup queen she has
taken some time off she is a
professional cellist for the New York
Philharmonic I think is what which one
she is
I can't remember she's a cellist in New
York she's oh she's a professional
cellist and she's amazing like she's
ridiculous but she has a YouTube channel
called diva makeup queen and her
eyeshadow formula is really really
really good she doesn't she didn't do
like these came out maybe two years ago
something like that so that was before
like the foiled trend hit so they're
they aren't like the foiled formula
they're just mattes and shimmers but
they're really really good let me swatch
some of these for you because they're
very good let's just kind of go across
she sent me a few of them but they're
just they're such good formula they're
very um they're very nice for there you
go for that beautiful soft look but the
lasting power is really good like I like
these better than my Tarte shadows I
mean yeah my Tarte wait yes I like these
better than my Tarte shadows in my Too
Faced shadows I was gonna say two-faced
but I agree with the Tarte too
they're just really good so I don't know
which sorry if I was going too fast let
me go a little slower here I don't know
which one is which because they're
always in the same packaging she doesn't
change their packaging they're these the
refillable like Z palette II kinds of
things there's what she always packages
him I can tell you which one was the
original this is not the original one
but they're just beautiful she did such
a good job on this formula and I'm
pretty sure she still sells them they're
just very very very very nice someone
asked what a cellist is someone that
plays the cello
is a cellist diva makeup queen is the
name of the brand diva makeup Queen
cosmetics this was the original palette
this is really good I mean do the
sparkly one down here I don't know if I
can even get and that one doesn't isn't
showing up on my skin to him very well
because this matches my skin to him but
look at this sparkly one and that shows
up on the eye they're really really
beautiful they're so nice they're so
nice and she is such a nice person and
she worked really hard on her eyeshadow
formula and it's really wonderful I love
it but again it's more for lighter looks
it's not that poppy for like foiled
formula but it's not they don't feel
like cheap you know
you know mass manufactured eyeshadow
they feel good you know what I mean the
mats are good Cheryl are they as good as
my busy art now but they're very good I
would say they're better than the
typical Sephora brands eyeshadows as far
as like tart and Too Faced and stuff
like that but not as good as like my
busy art not as good as coloured raine
devious place some of those indie brands
that i love but they're good they're
more again they're more of that soft
that soft formula somebody wants me to
swatch the mattes let's see let me get
here's a colored matte I don't think
this one shows up on my skin tone yeah
because I'm it like matches my skin tone
if you can see yes Shannon she made them
all on her own I don't know what the
price is honestly I don't know because
it's been forever but she's amazing
she's a wonderful person when it's a
little more pricey that I wanted to show
you Devon wants to know Jen if you ever
tried the Clarisonic brushes no I
haven't I haven't this Linda Hallberg oh
you know this is I'm going to the Linda
Hallberg in a minute cuz that's a
contour palette this one is kind of a
controversial one because I know not
everybody's gonna agree with me again
not as good as high-end they're not as
good as high-end but they're fun they're
really fun to play with this is the BH
Cosmetics wild an alluring palette for
some reason the BH Cosmetics baked
formula for me is very very very good I
do not like they're pressed formula at
all I find it to be very powdery doesn't
work for me at least the ones that I've
tried to haven't tried any of the newest
ones but for whatever reason the baked
formula I do really like again not as
good as my high-end stuff but it's very
fun I use the green shade on my daughter
for Halloween and it looked beautiful on
her and she was umma from from
descendants too and it was just
beautiful on her they will give you a
little bit of glitter on your face if
you don't use a glitter glue but if you
don't mind a little bit of glitter
they're um they're very nice very nice
you don't necessarily need a little
glitter glue unless you really want to
because the color doesn't fall down it's
just a little bit of the sparkle will
fall down I love these things
I love the the galaxy chic palette I
mean all of these things I really like
them Mimi wants to know if I've tried
Sydney Gracia I have not Jenna wants to
know if the BH brushes are any good I
cannot speak to them Nadine says my
niece was uma - it's so funny because
the uma costumes you couldn't find them
anywhere we had to order it online like
a month like beginning of October and
still it was hard Oh Nicole for me Renee
Nicole says I have the Clarisonic and
have to use the sensitive skin brush
attachment even though usually do not
sensitive skin I think it's because of
the retinol I use yeah you turn a nicole
good youtube channel check her out she's
amazing she's a good friend of mine
Thank You Nicole for putting that in
there because I didn't know the answer
to that question but yeah these are
really really fun shadows if you like
bright bold colors you just want to play
if you don't want to invest a lot in
some color but you want to start playing
with some color I would definitely
recommend this this was sent to me by BH
Cosmetics but I am NOT an affiliate and
I do not they don't know I'm mentioning
this in the video they said this to me
forever ago and I they said you know
make a video if you want
I chose not to make a video but I did
want to mention it because I do like it
another one Nicole's going to agree with
me on this one Sarah Mayer says BH
brushes are amazing Lynette says BH
brushes are pretty good actually nice
nice Holly says I returned my BH foil
palettes turned into a muddy mess on me
wish I would have tried the baked I do
really like the baked Sarah wants know
if I've tried that J cat beauty eye
palette I have not this is one of
Nicole's favorites from yay or nay
Nicole it's one of mine too I got this
in a boxy charm and I am scared how much
I like this because they are quite
pricey this is the blink I shadow
palette I brought this with me when I
went to to Iceland this was the only
eyeshadow I brought because we literally
like carried our backpacks and was like
all we broads because the luggage was
really expensive so we had like one bag
between all of us for a week and like
backpacks so I couldn't really bring a
whole lot and I think this was the only
eyeshadow I brought and oh my gosh the
these are fabulous like these are these
are so creamy oh my gosh if you have
oily lids though they may be a little
bit too much time at the cone but look
at these things compared to what I was
showing you a minute ago I mean look at
these this is a foiled formula though so
it's different than the UM it's
different than the diva makeup Queen
ones but just a little more soft of a
look this is like punch you in the eye
gorgeousness like are you kidding me
are you kidding me they're amazing
they're apps oh that red really chunked
up didn't it let me blend it out a
little bit very easy to blend out but I
am not I'm not affiliated with blank at
all oh my gosh that's really chunky girl
just blend it out a little bit I just
dug my finger in a little too hard
apparently there we go now they're not
as chunky you saw oh my gosh she saw the
chunks really crazy yeah they're
beautiful and the lasting power is
wonderful you can get a beautiful look
but they are kind of pricey why I was
very thankful to get in boxycharm
simply Bonnie says I love that blank
palette just don't drop it because they
break easily oh good to know
okay Oh Mimi says blink and pretty
vulgar are the same company are they
really because I didn't really like my
premolar palette that much wow I didn't
know that hmm Holly says that eyeshadow
palette is my favorite thing I ever
received a box of charm I hope they put
more in the brand and future boxes me
too me too it's so good yeah blend blend
blend
yes Joe blam-blam-blam- but lemons land
alright so this I wanted to show you
this is another pricey one man I need to
get more less expensive stuff in here I
did have a couple things but oh wait
before I get into this I forgot to show
you single shadows oh by the way just so
you know I did do a little bit of
shopping last night on the color array
and website I got one I got some of
their single shadows and then I got one
of their mini palettes I got the pinky
one Shae ray says what palette has works
worth splurging the money on Jen I want
to do a whole video and this is one of
the reasons why I bought it I got the
Pat McGrath mothership pal I got one of
those I have some Natasha - no nah I
have visi art I have some of these
really stupidly expensive eyeshadows and
I want to try to kind of break down for
you whether they're actually like I know
honestly I don't think any eyeshadow
powder is worth more than $60 in my
opinion that's kind of my here but when
I think something's worth it but kind of
show you why you know like the formulas
and whether we can compare it to things
that are less expensive I want to do a
whole video on that what wait horn a
minute where was I just saw Angela
Angela Angelica is here I need to learn
how to pronounce your last name because
everybody talks about you everybody
loves your channel and I love your
channel Angelica girl and yqv
is T it is not doesn't have enough
vowels my last name has way too many
vowels yours doesn't have enough and we
both probably have the exact same
problem she says I love LH Cosmetics are
you getting the new palates I wasn't
planning on getting the new palates but
I do love this one let's pause on what I
was going to show you a second let's
talk about this and said Jellico's here
our mortgage we're going to talk about
this this this contour palette it's
definitely meant for a professional
makeup artist like you got this black
here but the way that these blend
together is so awesome like I love the
way that they mix together where you can
add a little bit of cigar in with
pinwheel let me show you so like if I do
pinwheel this blush and I do cigar which
is like a grey I can put those together
what you can do with other palettes but
you can make them more muted like ashy
pink if you want to you know what I mean
and that's kind of the point of this so
I can take like this one Andromeda and
mix it with Zwicky which is the warm
tone Brown I mean you can even do this
with a lot of things when I'm gonna get
a little more Andromeda and really make
a fun cheek color there you know what I
mean so they're really they're just
really fun to play with because it's and
I really feel like this is made for
makeup artist by a makeup artist and
it's just it's fun to play with but
again very pricy and very bright boy my
friend Nancy I bought that one for me so
I did not purchase that one but but yeah
it's very fun if you if it's in your
budget I really enjoy the quality in the
formula and the lasting power and
everything is really good blends ability
is very nice a very makeup artist
friendly new quest new quest did I do it
right Angelica new quest
that's what Melanie is saying they do it
right new quest yeah you probably say it
a lot more beautifully than I do though
Angelica I'm sure you do I bet you say
it like with this your beautiful
beautiful accent your beautiful voice
new quest that sounds so American you
know like it sounds so not as pretty
like you know I feel like when you have
your own accent it I don't think it
sounds as pretty as other peoples it's
one of those
grass is always greener I did it she
said yay okay good all right let's go
back to I shadow so I do want to mention
these if you don't mind loose eyeshadows
because these are fabulous these are
from geek chic cosmetics they are so fun
they're so fun this is from their Hunger
Games collection it's it's the
Mockingjay shade these are incredible
and these I think are about about five
or six bucks apiece so there are
definitely more in the less expensive
range but look how pretty that is
just really beautiful Gina says Angelica
is very beautiful one has a great voice
I agree I agree people were asking me
about my look that I had on in the video
where I was talking about youtubers that
are awesome that Angelico totally could
have been in that video absolutely she's
got a great channel this was what was on
my eyes this is the shade luckdragon
this was one the inner corner this it's
kind of next to an old swatch but I'm
gonna kind of try to turn it a little
bit see if you can get that sparkle this
one is still available for purchase it
is my ultimate pink I'm feeling like the
antique like oh wait you can't really
see it in the swatch I've got that old
swatch the old green swatch doesn't look
good I'm looking at the replay it is not
doing it justice hold on let me see if I
can do better because that one deserves
better let me get my my solar water
I have little baby my solar water here
and see if I can clean my hand a little
bit so cuz that one that one deserves
better than that
okay tank says geek chic had sanitation
issues really I hadn't heard of that
really I have to look that up oh my gosh
I've never heard of that Wow
well the eyeshadows I'll have I really
like let's see if I can get that better
can you see that better I don't know if
it's gonna come off on camera
what's the top antique gold that gold
wasn't called mockingjay I don't know we
have to find some evidence on that
though I need I need more on that one
because that would make me cry it's
still not showing off the way that I
want it to but it's got these beauties
beautiful like green blue it will
greenish kind of shift to it along with
the pink and I love it so pretty this is
one from their Harry Potter collection
if you wanted to see a matte this is
called oh no it's not a matte mmm it's
called mischief managed I always I don't
buy a lot of mattes and singles because
I feel like I've got pretty much every
matte that I could ever want know if
this is gonna show up on camera so
pretty Valerie wants to know if I have
the supernatural collection girl you
know I do I have one next I'll show you
it's called they're called the super
neutrals and this one is called angel of
Thursday this one I don't know if you're
gonna be able to see it but it's got
it's a silver with a pink shift and it's
so pretty I am a Hadi says please read
unrelated question shape tape oxidize
domine do you know why
oMG I'm so glad I can talk live I'm
driving and had to pull over to talk to
you hopefully see you read this Oh be
safe driving I don't know why it
oxidizes on you I have not had that
problem I am so sorry you know what the
best thing to do I think would be to
contact Tarte and find out from them I
do want to tell you I did kind of try to
start something with Tarte and I haven't
heard anything back I want to know from
chart I want to know if Amazonian clay
is a real thing I don't think it is
I don't think Amazonian clay is a real
thing because it's not listed in their
ingredients the only clay that's in
their ingredients is Kalyn and I think
Amazonian clay is fake I think it's all
marketing I don't think it's real I've
sent them three messages now asking them
about the Amazonian clay and
and whether it's actually a real
ingredient and they have never responded
to me tank says geek chic fingerprints
and size the jars moldy lipstick oh my
gosh
fingerprints inside the jar I'm gonna
have to look that up girlfriend that
makes me sad
but yeah so yeah Stella says it's Kaelyn
clay and that's that's seem to me that's
not cool man like I I cannot stand
behind that like with the whole don't
mess with the ingredients you know you
got to tell me what the stuff really is
Amazonian clay girl that's the only
ingredient that's in there that's clay
you know and everybody uses Kaylin it's
not like they're going down to the
Amazon and digging it up and then it was
because they were people contacting me
and saying you know well you know they
really shouldn't be digging for clay in
the Amazon and I felt like being like I
don't think they're digging for clay in
the Amazon I think they're just getting
Calum from enough from lab you know and
but it's crazy because a lot of their
marketing says with Amazonian clay to do
XY and Z like I don't think so that's my
thought anyway but they won't respond to
me so I don't know I don't know I'm not
sure where where Kaling comes from to be
completely honest Melissa says wow do
you really think it's fake maybe it's
just clay from the Amazon that's from
that's from Amazon calm
it could be clay from amazon.com that's
a really good point maybe it is maybe
they bought their kaylynn on amazon.com
and that's how its Amazonian clay that's
a great point Melissa it's great point
I'm gonna that's gonna be my next email
my 50 mil de tart hello one of my
subscribers suggested you get your clay
from Amazon that's why it's Amazonian
clay so if I buy Kalyn from amazon.com
well I have Amazonian clay as well
that's a good point
I love it I love it I love it I love it
alright let's go ahead and move on to
the next thing let's see okay we talked
concerts let's talk about this one this
was another thing that I gotten at a
time ATS last year this is by a brand
called high DD I don't think this is
women of color friendly either I don't
think they have a deep enough shade in
my opinion but hopefully they will
expand their shade range if I have any
advice to cosmetic prances please please
jump in Joseph ATS you need to you need
to extend your shade range but it does
work really really well it's a very nice
contour kit it's called hashtag selfie
worth and they're just beautiful shades
they're very for a very very light
natural-looking contour I am NOT into
the into the Instagram contour it
doesn't look good on me you know I'm
almost 40 girlfriend I don't need an
Instagram contour I look ridiculous with
an Instagram contour so this is right up
my alley and I love it for my skintone
I'm sad that there aren't more skin
tones it bothers me but if you are of my
skin tone or a real baby I think they
have one that's a little darker than
this I think but it's definitely not as
deep as it should be in my opinion but
it is a really good formula I do want to
show you this even though this is a
brand that people have talked about you
know forever but bare minerals I feel
like doesn't get enough hype for their
products I feel like I'm kind of like
Estee Lauder how well no because Estee
Lauder I feel like they put out a lot of
stuff that's very mediocre like they put
out some really good stuff but then they
put out some stuff that's like really
like almost like how Revlon like they've
been doing this forever like why can't
you put out a good product especially
the price point of Estee Lauder but I
feel like bare minerals is one of those
brands that they they kind of have that
I haven't caught up with the times kind
of feel to them so I think they get
ignored a lot this is their blush
they're loose blush and enchanted Beauty
it's really really pretty and I really
like this a lot it's got a sifter on the
inside like that and then let me show
you what it looks like but it's really
pretty it's beautiful and I love the I
love the the way that it sets on the
skin like it's just very pretty
really like that a lot holla holla D I
don't know what's going on there Perico
friendly contour any tips I do have a
whole video on contouring and how to
contour in a more natural way and that's
on my channel that's probably the best
thing to watch because I'll actually
show you in that video Susan says agreed
bareMinerals deserves more love but they
need to work on their face products they
need work on their face products are
awesome weak they need to work on their
face products are awesome
we're missing some words in there that's
okay I'm not picking on you I'm just I'm
trying to understand what you're trying
to say I really like the bare minerals
the powder the the setting powder is
really really good and I really love
their liquid lipsticks and I really love
this blush but I did not like their
serum foundation I was not a fan of that
I ended up having to throw that away
because it was just not good but I have
high hopes for bare minerals I think
that they can do good things
Jodie wants hey Jodie from yodelin Jodha
another great youtube channel have you
considered doing a beauty collection
video you know it would be like four
hours long it's too much girlfriend it's
too much too much I can't even that just
makes gives me anxiety just thinking
about that Laurie says I didn't care for
the blush I'm sorry oh I like it I like
it I do enjoy it a pure soul wants to
know what is in the bareMinerals that
causes a reaction in some people I have
no idea I have to look at the individual
ingredient listen see Arwen says I'm not
really a bareMinerals girl yeah I mean
there's definitely some things that I
really like about bare minerals but
there are some things that I don't Oh
Angelica says I think a lot of people
are sensitive to business it's the
bismuth oxychloride and a lot of mineral
products yes that is one of the
ingredients yes yeah Navion says that
probably the bismuth bismuth oxychloride
yes Liz says gem what are some of your
foundation shades so I can get idea of
how to compare I don't know my knack
shade I've never bought a Mac foundation
because I'm gonna be honest with you I'm
gonna break it down on be honest with
you
when I go into Mac and I see the girls
in there with their foundation I do not
prefer the level of coverage that they
use for myself the level of coverage
that I see when I go into Mac is way too
intense for what I would want on my face
I think that's the nicest way I can say
it so therefore I have never bought a
Mac foundation even though I do know
that Mac makes different levels of
coverage and their foundation I just
have never gone there the shades that I
have here that are mine this one is in
the shade soft beige this one is in
light and this one is in beige I really
go more of the light to light medium is
kind of where I'm at in every foundation
I do have neutral undertones so anything
that's like a light to like light medium
with neutral undertones is usually where
I go for a frame of reference but I
don't know my Mac number I should
probably go in just to get color match
just so I can tell you what it is and
like write it down just don't like that
look it's just not for me
all right oh I want to show you these no
one talks about these these are so good
you need a glitter glue though the
violet Voss the loose glitters from
violet balls these are really really
good they are so fun but you definitely
need a glitter glue they're not meant to
stick without a glitter glue and I don't
think I can I'll just show you like that
Preston but they're really beautiful
really beautiful oh my gosh oh there's
another brand I wanted to tell you about
it's really good one on there in here
right here for eyeshadows here we go
this is what I want to show you MBA
cosmetics these are fab this is their
chroma lights foil effects glitter these
are wonderful these do not get enough
hype I feel like I just talked about
these but look at this are you kidding
me are you kidding me you do need
glitter glue though it seems like you
might not need glitter glue but you need
them these things are so fab so fab
allora wants to know my favorite glitter
glue I've been using the Too Faced for
years I just got the NYX one and I find
that one to also be very a
I haven't put them head-to-head yet this
is insane this is the MBA M as in monkey
B as in banana and a as in astronaut I
don't know
monkey with a banana in space that just
what happened to me I don't know this is
a chroma lights foil effects glitter and
Holy Grail these are these are
phenomenal these are wonderful these are
they also have loose shadows here these
are some of the matte ones until I like
my shimmery stuff though so this is part
of the agape love girl oh this has got a
shimmer in it this is part of the agape
love girl collection these are super fab
but these are less expensive too these
are not super pricey so yeah MBA
cosmetics is definitely one you might
want to check out if you're looking for
something a little less expensive let me
wipe that off this towel is definitely
going to have to go in the laundry
because there's glitter all over it now
all right next up but yeah the no one's
gonna say the violet Voss ones are
really good too but these are more
expensive honestly if I had to pick
between violet Voss and MBA I go MBA
because they are less expensive and
there really isn't that much difference
between these two as far as like the
quality goes and MBA is less expensive
but they're both really good let's see
what did I show you okay we didn't do
lips yet so let's go into lips these
I've shown in some live chats recently
these are really really good this is the
brand color the world these are really
hydrating lipsticks I mean they've got
this cardboard packaging which is you
know it's not very luxurious but the
lipstick inside they are so hydrating
and moist and wonderful I really really
like them there's a very very mild
makeup e scent it's not strong but they
don't smell good that's my biggest
critique of these but they're just
really nice and they they have a little
bit of a stain to them so when you put
them on you can kind of go through your
day and then like halfway through the
day even after like the moisture has
worn off you do still have a little bit
of even color on your lips which I
really
like a lot packaging like I said is a
little bit cheap looking at Alison says
the same thing not a fan the packaging
I'm not either just well I mean they're
cute but they're not luxurious in any
way but they're just it's such a
wonderful formula it's a very nice
formula so I do really like it even
though the packaging is a little bit not
luxurious they're they're cute though I
mean they got cute little owls and
things on them they're more cute than
than fancy but the formula inside is
really really good
I do wish they snow it a little bit
better that would make me happy
Sharon wants to know have you tried the
JD glow shadows no I don't think that I
have she says I have an intense yellow
gold and a metallic yellow with a green
undertone and my friend has a beautiful
metallic red that's cool yeah I don't
think I've tried those and then someone
else was mentioning about the angel ones
what macdaddy the hiss brands I have
only ever tried the highlighters from
him and I find them to be a little bit
too sparkly for me they're a little too
intense they just don't fit my personal
style but if you're like going to the
club and you're you know in your 20s and
you're going out on a date or going out
on a date night and you're older it
doesn't matter then maybe but I feel
like they're just a little too intense
for me like they're not they're not my
style but they do wear very well and
they're very beautiful but it's just not
my style the the angel stuff the what's
it called artist couture artists couture
yes thank you muse like artist couture
like yeah artists Kotori there we go
we're on the same page here me and you
Naomi we're on the same page
Steph says oh she's talking about Stila
I don't know which product she's talking
about though she's talking about
something oh okay it's amber and Steph
are talking back and forth let me see
what what they're talking about because
it looks very interesting this
conversation I can't find it
I lost it man I want to know what you
guys are talking about okay but anyway I
don't know what she's talking about
she looks like Steph's looks like she's
dropping some knowledge over there
though all right what else okay more
lipstick so if you've seen my channel
for a while you know that I am friends
with Shaunie over at total makeup junkie
101 she did come out with her ronny
cosmetics line i do
want to mention these because I don't
think people are talking about them
enough especially because the Shawnee
beat everybody on this trend in the
United States this has been around in
India for a while it's very common in
India at least from what my subscribers
tell me it's very common in India to do
like a glitter inside of a lip product
but there wasn't a whole lot of it
before he shot he came out with these
and now they seem to be popping up
everywhere everything with a little bit
of glitter in it a little bit of you
know glitter in it I'm repeating myself
they were never again the lipsticks are
really good I'll actually like the
lipsticks better than the lip glosses
because I feel like the sparkle shot
shows up more kind of show you that
hopefully you can see it this one is in
the shade latte they smell really good
too they smell really really good
hopefully the shine showed up I'll have
to wait till it it's like a 30-second
delay for me they smell amazing they do
have like when you are very cleansing oh
they did show it did show up a little
bit you can barely see the shine in the
replay if there's a little bit of a
purple glitter in this but one thing I
love about these is that as you as they
wear down they wear down very very
evenly so they you don't have glitter
just hanging out on your lips afterwards
because I think is awesome I don't know
how she did that
but she did the one critique I have is
that to put it on it doesn't feel super
comfortable to put it on the application
process it's a very hard formula as far
as like putting it on like it doesn't
feel super soft and smooth and creamy to
apply and you can kind of feel the
glitter when you apply it but you can't
feel it on your lips once you've applied
it so if you can get past that like how
it feels as you put it on there
fantastic the lasting power is really
good and like I was saying a minute ago
I they leave a with these with these
ones from what does this color the world
it's the same thing where they leave
kind of a stain on your lips where the
the color will linger pass the the
hydration of it which is really really
nice and I really love these they're
fantastic and even if my friend hadn't
created them I would still feel the same
way and the
let's see okay the liquid lipsticks I
like a little bit less because I I just
really like this so I feel like the
liquid lipsticks didn't have a shot in
my opinion Alison wants to know is it
kriti it feels gritty to go on like the
actual lip applicator like when you put
it on you can feel grit like as you
slide it across your lips but once you
go like once it's on and you go like
this you can't feel grit so you don't
feel it actually it's just it's just in
the application that's not once it's
there this is the same way the liquid
lipsticks this one is in the shade rose
these are moosie they do not dry down
completely see if you can see that it is
a like a pinky purple with a gold shift
to it it's very very pretty I really
like these
Jody wants to know about indie brands I
will touch on that in just a second
don't let me forget Jody but it is it's
a nice liquid liquid lipstick formula
it's not my favorite liquid lipstick
formula just because I well I don't know
I went let me let me dig into my soul
here a little bit you know I'm trying to
think of things I don't like about these
I just really like the lipstick formula
better because I like the staining of it
with this I don't feel like how's that
standing effect these are really good
too like I'm trying to like find
something I don't like about these but I
like them the application can be a tiny
bit streaky
but you can even it out pretty easily it
just you know they're good they're just
really good I don't know I'm trying to
think of something I don't like but I do
like them question was how it when is a
brand not an indie brand and more
technically colour-pop is not an indie
brand at this point because the owners
of colour-pop own multiple companies the
see beauty of multiple companies an
indie brand is an independently owned
branch so it doesn't matter the price
point of it it doesn't matter how like
how far the reach of the brand is all it
means is that the brand is not owned by
a parent company that owns multiple
brands so like to face for the longest
time was considered an indie brand even
when it was at Sephora it was still an
indie brand but then Estee Lauder bought
them not that long ago and that's when
they stopped being an indie brand it's
it's just based on who owns it that's
all it is it has nothing to do with you
know the distribution or the price or
anything it's just all about who owns it
so hopefully that answers your question
I do have two more liquid lipsticks I
want to talk to you about and I've got
16 percent battery and three mint two
minutes left on the clock
okay so this one right here is by an
indie brand called tater rounds beauty
and you can see that this is very at sea
as far as the packaging goes but I
really like this liquid lipstick I find
this one to be this particular shade
called Artemis is really really nice if
I have a liquid lipstick that I feel is
too warm I can pop this over the top and
it cools it down for me and I really
like this I really like this it's it
dries down but it's not super duper uber
drying it's a little dry but not super
dry and I really like that a lot
the other one is this is I couldn't find
see what's killing me is because I was
rushing this morning because I changed
plans at the last minute I can't
remember the name of her brand depeche
girl let me let me look it up because
it's gonna drive me bonkers
she sent me she sent me a set of her
liquid lipsticks and they're so good and
I was rushing and I couldn't find them
cryptic cosmetics thank you so much
internet for cryptic cosmetics cryptic
cosmetics though the liquid lipstick
formula is really good it reminds me a
lot of the Ophir liquid lipsticks
they're just they're kind of a nice
balance between drying and hydrating
they're just a really really nice
formula I love that this was the one
they did in collaboration with solar
look this is the de peche girl shade and
it's just really a nice formula they had
a set of three that just came out not
that long ago and they are fabulous just
a really really nice formula I really
enjoy it and she's very nice she's
contacted me through email she's super
nice and I do really like this formula
let me tell you
almost like a very creamy very very
creamy smells very sweet very nice there
let me smell this one because I know
some people really care about sense this
one doesn't smell good it doesn't smell
bad it's just got a tiny tiny bit of
chemically kind of scent but they're
both really good formulas I definitely
recommend them trying to think of
anything else that I think that's all I
had on the table does anybody have any
questions about anything we have oh it's
been an hour but we'll leave it open for
questions for just a minute JD says I

you like Jeffrey star products Allison
wants to know product wise everything
I've tried from Jeffrey star I've
enjoyed I have tried his one of his
blushes and Regina George which i think
is a fantastic formula I also have a
full review on the knotty androgyny
palette I always forget what it's called
the other palette the out of my head
palette I can't remember what it's
called
fantastic eyeshadow palette not a fan of
him as a man as a person not a fan of
that so do not purchase anything from
him anymore that is a personal choice I
do not shame anyone that chooses to buy
from him and I don't shame anybody that
chooses anything regarding to him it's
Beauty killer Thank You Steph and AJ but
yeah no that's a big no on that but as
far as makeup goes man knows how to mix
makeup so you that but I do not purchase
anything from that brand that's a
personal choice and there's very few
brands that I don't purchase from that's
one of them of the very few
I can't even think of another brand I
don't I don't straight just don't
purchase from Lime Crime I've burnt I've
purchased from Lime Crime but I've
learned my lesson because I don't enjoy
their products so and also I don't enjoy
I don't enjoy things about them as a
brand but there's very few brands that I
play cod Lime Crime and Jeffrey star two
of them boycott boycott such a strong
word even though it's true alright I'm
