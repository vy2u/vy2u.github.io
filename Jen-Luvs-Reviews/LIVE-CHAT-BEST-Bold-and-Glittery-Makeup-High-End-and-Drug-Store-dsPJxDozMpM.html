bold makeup and I'm really excited to
talk about all that with you I've got a
table full of goodies here to show you

the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness on all of their favorites as
well so you don't just get my opinion

do you want to preface this because they
do have a lot of new subscribers I want
to thank you so much for subscribing the

forth between talking with the people
who are here and talking to you so if
that bothers you this may not be the
best video for you I have lots of other
content that you can enjoy let's see
what else
also I got my makeup in this video the
reason why is because I stay up super
late on Saturday nights editing my
makeup news show called what stupid
makeup that goes live every Sunday
morning and my my game adorns busted on
me waking up early to put makeup on for
the chat and I'd rather be healthier and
get as much sleep as possible so yeah so
I don't wear makeup in this video that's
something I get asked a lot that's all I
could think up for right now but if you
have oh chat always is usually I can't
say always usually at 10 a.m. Eastern
time on the channel I get asked that a
lot when is chat and all you have to do
is just go to my channel page and you
should see the live feed to join we do
do a 5 p.m. chat occasionally it's
supposed to be the last Sunday of the
month but it keeps getting bumped for
various reasons a lot of holidays fall
at the end of the month things like that
but I'll let you know when the next 5
p.m. chat is oh let's see yep that's it
for now so let's go ahead and say hello

years I was really nervous to put up the
video at first because I was worried

trimmed a couple of things out that I
now wish that I have left it yeah I
think another good people are setting
them in the comments and it's like Turin

nervous about being misinterpreted so

a lot of people if I just keep really
deserve nothing but if you're here
thank you so much for being that I
appreciate it so uh and it is this is
her first time being here I'm so glad
that you're here okay
let's go ahead and start talking about
some of the products so the first thing
I wanted to talk about was bases because
I feel like putting down especially for
our shadow a base is important to get
that pop so I want to tell you about the
Urban Decay primer potion in Eden
that's what I've been using most lately
there is a Duke furnace the Ulta brand
eyeshadow primer in nude is a dupe for
this and I minds pretty much out I took
it with me on vacation and at this point
I I'm not sure exactly what I did with
it but it's like almost out so I wanted
to show you this one but those work well
Mac's Paint Pot in painterly is also a
favorite of mine to put down because I
feel like you really need that to help
get that pop on your lids actually oh
somebody says who's this karen says good
morning you have my coffee I got to get
mine mine's right here
there's my coffee I forgot about me
guilty we're gonna clear some room on
this little end table here like a TV
tray so any other good bases that you
guys use that I could recommend to
people I really I do feel like that's
really important also you can use things
like fix+
to wet your brush or water to wet your
brush one thing that I've learned
through the the wonderfulness of the
community because I was doing it wrong
forever is that what I was doing was I
was spraying my brush and then dipping
it in the product and I was ruining a
lot of my products that way so what I
learned was to dip the brush in the
product then spray it then apply it and
then take like a towel or something and
kind of just quickly dry it off before
you do the same thing again it's kind of
high maintenance but it's worth it for
the punch
let's getting some suggestions from the
community Steph sets off glitter primer
for everything you can't say it enough
nice Steph Katie says do you have oily
eyelids Jen I try the Urban Decay
original pirate potion in my eyes go
priest maybe in the even version is
different my lips are so oily I do not
have oily lids at all so I can't speak
to that unfortunately and you might be
able to get a sample of it if you have a
Sephora near you they might be I'll
buddy gave you like a little bit enough
in that thing or whatever in a jar or
and they might be able to apply it on
your lids and put a little shadow on so
that you can try it for a day that's
what I would recommend they also give
out samples of this occasionally
so in like little you know like like
support I'll have like a little before
you check out it'll say do you want to
add samples to your bag sometimes
they'll have like the sampling strip
that has all the different primers so I
would definitely keep an eye out for
that at Sephora at ulta when you're
shopping online let's say milk milk
pencil from NYX quest says yes
absolutely did I die I'm not sure if I
said that one I meant to say that one
but that's a pen that isn't kind of an
on like old-school staple for me that
that was the first eyeshadow base that I
ever used and it's so well loved I think
I'm wrong with my fourth one something
like that Hassan is here mary says she
learned that trick from me oh I don't
know which trick you're talking about
but oh I'm so glad love my Vandy says I
want to try a new tart one in a pod I
wonder if it's as good as Mac I don't
know yeah I'm curious about it too I saw
it in the news today all thank you Cathy
she says I look beautiful as always
that's so nice
amanda says the LA girl white primer
stick is also villain free and doesn't
crease nice and average girl Beauty says
wet and wild color icon glitters singles
suck on their own but they're great as a
glitter adhesive or face nice very good
Thank You tabatha for the video link
lots of really good suggestions here
thank you so much and black diamonds and
pearls says elf iPlayer isn't bad either
Cathy wants me to say hi to her husband
Edie
what's up Ben how you doing how's life I
hope life is treating you well ed yes
it's a hard on my lips okay let's go
ahead and move on so since we talked
about eyeshadow primer we should
probably talk about eyeshadow so I
brought out a bunch of single eyeshadows
that I wanted to show you that really
give you that punch
now some people are really nervous about
doing a punch of color on the lid so
there's lots of different things you can
do to add that punch without your whole
eye being look like editorial style so
one thing you can do is you can add kind
of
hopper to it these are really really
nice they're a little on the pricey side
for this stuff but they last forever and
they're super high quality these this is
the naked snack this is that you're a
deficit one
it's amazing what this does let me get a
shadow here these are all kind of
popping I want to get with a boring
shadow okay here we go
this Tarte palette that I was going to
show you in a second has a point shutter
we're gonna take em in oh that's really
close to Mike it's really close to my
skin tone though let me see if I got
caught all right second we'll grab the
Jacqueline copilot cuz it happens to be
right here okay and let's do let's do
this green that everybody loves it here
it's a matte then I'm gonna swatch it
here let's watch it yet it's really
quick okay and then we're gonna take
this naked cosmetics this one is in the
wait what does it call IV one is if this
is the iridescent staff forget what the
official name of it is
okay and you see how it changed it to
just having a little bit of an
iridescent shift so if you have
something like this bold bright color
you can put something on this to kind of
calm it down a little bit but also give
it a really neat iridescent ship out of
the ship is coming across here or not
it's coming across to me but I don't
know if it's more nice and still so yeah
so this is a nice way to add like a
little pop right in the center of the
lid so if you do with a neutral base and
then just right in the center adding for
just a little bit of color or you can do
a neutral base and just add a little bit
of a deeper color on the outer corner or
you can do a neutral base and just put a
little pop right here on the out to the
center of your eyelid and I think that
looks really pretty too and those of you
that are new I am NOT makeup trained I
just play a lot so these are things that
I've learned through plain picnic okay
so anyway these are really really good
Navy cosmetics makes fantastic I chose a
really worse they want so crazy
it drives me bonkers if you have if C
point sometimes look giveaway singles or
on if C points so I think they have one
on there right now
action pound a whole bag of these things
because I get them at IMAX does they
have them at UM discount every year at
I'm at so I usually get a staff when I
go so I've got like this whole special
thing that's just for my naked stats so
they're really puffy a lot of them there
are much if there's even any mats in
there I know I always reach for the
shimmer so if I have any mattes I don't
really use them I use the shimmers no I
think they're all shimmery just oh I
love them so much okay moving on this
step says I'm not in any way alright
move into the drugstore these L'Oreal
infallible shadows are fantastic for a
pop of shimmer and shine this one is my
absolute favorite this one is called
iced latte I can't read it on here but I
know where it what do you know this is
amber rush this is iced latte they look
almost this wait no I the cat's next
I know this is iced lattÃ© this is amber
rush I also have this one here this one
is called infinite sky I reach for this
one plate as much but these are really
really nice for that pop of shine they
also recently came out with using
fallible metallics they're basically in
my opinion the exact same formula
they're just pressed better
they're just pushed harder so they don't
make as much of a mess where these have
this like where you like have to open it
up and there's this little plug and then
inside it's pressed in there and they
can kind of power up a bit but then you
put the little plug back in then that's
fine Aaron says amber rushes our
favorite yes so so yeah so those are
those are really really good for
drugstore options I was gonna show you
this this is on sale right now for $30
at Sephora I gave this a relatively
negative review in that I didn't like
the way that the colors muddy together
on my eyes now looking back I wish I'd
given it a three part rating instead of
a two part rating I feel like two hearts
was a little bit harsh I was going back
and forth in my mind at the time it
decided to do two hearts but I really
feel like it's more than three what I've
done with this is all like I did what I
did on when I was on my vacation exactly
what I just said I did a neutral base
and then I just popped one of these
colors in the center had a new look
every single day and it was wonderful
this one's probably my new favorite
shadow in the middle but I would
definitely think that this is worth it
for $30 absolutely the original price
was kind of like food a little bit but
$30 I think that it's worth it
um you said he says elf smudge pots for
the wind yes and that's the sense she's
excited about the L'Oreal metallics and
Cindy wants to know if amber rushes dark
let me show them I would say it's dark
oats if you big toe but it's beautiful
it's very soft there are a lot like the
Giorgio Armani whatever those things are
called the eyes to kill it's the same
parent company so it's like a mid-tone
bronze shade it's beautiful it's
absolutely beautiful
Brianna let's talk about she hates some
limited edition stuff that she wants to
get the chart Collett
I feel your girlfriend a failure okay
either a shadow single eyeshadows okay
this is fun
MBA cosmetics this is the oil effects
glitter in holy grill this is an indie
brands you can only get it on their
website I believe but you see how it's
like a glitter but it doesn't come out
in order to get the glitter out you have
to swirl your finger in it then you end
up with something like this and then BAM
I think they put a little bit of mineral
oil or some kind of oil to kind of
adhere the glitter to itself now this
will give you fallout if you don't put a
face down on MBA does sell a base it
looks like this it's just like a little
indie brand looking base it works great
or the Too Faced shadow insurance the
glitter glue is fabulous this was on
sale at t now Nordstrom rep I got this
on sale for 10 bucks at Nordstrom Rack
so keep your eye out for this there I
wasn't that long ago that I got that so
keep your eye out if you have a
Nordstrom Rack near you but these are
fantastic if you like really poppy
eyeshadows I definitely recommend
checking out MDA cosmetics there are an
indie brands so they're not they're not
super pricey there are reasonably priced
I believe but they're less than let's
say like the naked stacks it's only
really one nice grand my friend Lydia
works with them and she's she puts out
the most beautiful looks her Instagram
is called agape love girl AGA PE love
girl and she's got a lot of swatches of
MDA cosmetics on her Instagram so make
sure you follow her if you're interested
in MDA cosmetics please that's that's
the best place to find those things by
the balm these over shadows are
wonderful I did too a fold the balm
brand review where I've talked about all
of the parts I've ever tried by the ball
and I'm kind of on the balm collector
but these are wonderful kind of like The
Naked staff kind of like these four
overtop of eyes shadows or you can wear
them alone to do a really shimmery base
let me show you this one this one is
called work is overrated
this one isn't quite as I'm going to put
it next to the glitter and it's not
going to look like much but oh
I don't want to I feel bad things but
crazy
I guess it's Crazy's beauty review says
I've been into this you a skinny-dip
palette first shiny and led there so
filled without a spray and I have hooded
eyes got no transfer which is so cool
that is awesome
fabulous glad to know that I've seen a
couple of reviews of it and they've been
all positive but I don't own it so I
can't show it to you the next get four
single eyeshadows and eyeshadow palettes
that I want to show you that I find is
like just like totally puffy I'm making
a huge mess all over this oh well I
don't care I don't care
good morning Julie how are you what's
work is overrated I agree I agree Aspen
and Mary okay oh my gosh girlfriend Jen
what is happening to you okay these
right here these are the Stila
magnificent metals these are all over
YouTube they're called glitter and glow
magnificent metals this one is in ballet
baby and this one's in kitten plum I
keep getting asked in that video about
five reasons why youtuber is huge
youtubers succeed or whatever it is
whatever I ended up dating me
I keep asking what was on my lid getting
asked what was on my lid during a video
it was this and that's all I did was I
laid down a neutral base and then I pop
this in all over the top lid and it's
wonderful the only thing about this is
it is wet so it it takes a while for it
to dry so I have to let go like this
until it dries and even then I've gained
a little transfer so if you have hooded
lids or if you find that your your lid
color transfers to like here then this
may not be the product for you or I
haven't tried this but you could try
setting down a glitter glue first to see
if that helps with the transfer I
haven't tried that yet but it's a
possibility
Steph says MBA shadows - oh but well
thank you so much for that I appreciate
you looking at that Megan says she has
five of the steel looks magnificent
shadows and she loves them so what I'd
like to do is ask the collective brain
of makeup awesomeness what are some of
your favorite eyeshadows for giving a
pop and if you're not watching this live
you are still part of the collective
burning of makeup awesomeness and you
can definitely leave the answers to
these questions down in the comments so
that we can
read and learn from you this is why
we're the collective brain is because
we're all one giant colossal
conglomerate of a brain all working
together to find the best products and
that's why it's Lucia says I still want
to steal a magnificent medal so bad but
the price tells me as a broke college
student what do you think are the best
dupes if any Jenn I haven't found
anything these to be honest I'm really
sorry I haven't found any because what
happens is is you get a lot of fallout
with products like this you get a lot of
like I haven't found any honestly like
with this kind of formula of where
you've got the doe foot applicator that
dips in and cuts all over your leg but I
haven't found any drugstore deep yet but
if I ever find any I mean let me know
thunderstruck by Kat Von D is what mary
says Vanessa says the nicks prismatic
gave a nice pop Megan says Judy's place
masquerade palette has great break
shakes for pops of color what in the
world is wrong with me I meant to get
those out oh my goodness what is wrong
with me I am this with her that I was
thinking about that and for some reason
I forgot to bring these out genius
placed out now this one is not the most
popping Megan's right the masquerade
palette husband was off but Judy's place
eyeshadows are incredible let me swatch
a couple these for you and some of you
can get a little nervous with Judy's
place because it is a black-owned makeup
brand a bomb brand and they see all this
African stuff and they think well I have
a light skin tone there's no way I can
wear you know things that are made for
deep skin that is not true I want you to
tape that thought I want you to take it
out of your brain and I want you to
throw it in the trash because just
because of brand is a black-owned makeup
brand and maybe catering to a deep skin
tone does not mean people with a like
skin tone can't wear it these are
amazing you are missing out and I don't
want you to miss out because you judge
that there's
African stuff on the top so don't do
that okay I'm gonna go ahead and put
this right here to show you these two
swatches oh my goodness we're not bright
but they are shiny they are shiny I have
all of
here on TV place pallets are in here
because this is I haven't put these away
from what I did my favorites video my 11
brand you should try this is the
full-size masquerade palette and they I
do have a smaller one that I would
definitely recommend getting over this
one because no one in there no one sees
this watch out unless you're like
wearing this every single day just get
the small one you don't need all this
but bam bam bam oh girl wait for that
switch oh my goodness oh my goodness oh
that one look so good let's Reese
watching that one now with you cannot so
good I don't really like that one
no one can get that one this is the pink
there we go it just took some building
it's fine now but I don't like that so
much damn those are so break this might
in the eighties setting that remind you
of like Cyndi Lauper and big blonde like
crimped hair like big huge sets that
reminds me of that policeman right there
but anyway you were absolutely right
baby thank you so much for the reminder
I have a rainbow pair of shorts over
here when your dogs going to tell moving
on uh let's see
Gwen says metal max hello to Melanie's
Jennifer says butter LONDON I glaze oh

suggestions if I missed something that

minutes to render after that will you
please come back and leave it in the
comments
I feel bad he Beauty says Revlon
Photoready photo-ready I art do doooo

one says I'm awesome
Nelson to go ahead and move on to two to
be highlighter next yeah let's just
compiler let's just jump into the best
upper and I've got some lip stuff and I
got some blushes for highlighter the
anasazi of glow kits are wonderful I
have the one in green I don't think this
is available anymore but I really like
this one a lot really really poppy
bright highlighters and don't be afraid
to do these highlighters on your eyes
too multi-purpose well front up with my
multi-purpose
the tardis glow is really nice
this one's a little bit more subtle some
of them but these shades right here are
really nice for a super pop and then
these are lighter pop and then there's
some cleaning products down here then
they don't care for quite as much just
this one is cream Wow yes I don't care
for it play as much because I do like it
I just personally as a personal
preference don't really prefer green
contours it's much more like powder
contours I don't know why I guess it
seemed to practice one more but this is
a really nice highlighter palette this
one from Sephora is really nice my play
Nancy said this to me
this is the luminizing palette by
Sephora this one is fantastic it's a
little less as far as price point and it
reminds me a lot of the Anasazi oh one
that one's not quite as glow they're
talking about in the collective brain
and talking about the new Sephora Pro
palette ever heard they're really
wonderful and they're comparable to the
natasha - no no one's and let's watch
them I have not seen them I cannot vouch
for them cannot do it
meet me starting my jeffree star
highlighters are so good that's what
I've heard I've heard that they're very
good okay this is one that I feel like
it gets a lot of love like kind of on
the down-low
this is gilded honey by Laura Geller if
you ever see any of these with the Bates
with the swirl thing especially if you
can find them on sale like the gift sets
oh my goodness these are wonderful
here's one of the blushes that I brought
out because this is a really nice puppy
blush this one's in papaya but these are
fantastic I love these so much
they're so poppy and glowy and wonderful
radio world Paul says he loves my coffee
mug thank you so much I appreciate that
a student gave this to me when I was
teaching and didn't have like a little
teddy bear in it it was like an
end-of-the-year gift from one of my
students so I love it it's a perfect
size I love that it's thin too because
it fits in my car cup holder if I need
to but yeah these more Geller baked
products are fantastic I've heard a lot
of people recently saying that they
don't enjoy big product they have a bad
time with baked products these are a
huge exception these things are meat
horse back of highlighters I did have a
full-size of the champagne pop but I
gave it to a friend of mine I do
cluttered it because I have the
Jacqueline hole palates
I don't need two champagne pops in my
life so I gave it away but I do have
these little minis that I've gotten in
sets this one is rose gold and this one
is opal these are uh tronic really poppy
highlighters so this one's the rose gold
and then this one is the opal opal is
shinier than rose gold but I would
imagine rose gold will be beautiful on
deeper skin tones as well where the
lighter ones may look a little bit too
white a little too shiny you know I'm
not really meshing into the skin as well
but yeah really really pretty really
really poppy rachel says need to try
more color pop Tyler's but love milk
money and works on textured skin nice
good to know Vanessa says level or
dollar balance and brighten blushes
a rose says can I give a shout-out to
the milk makeup stuff no highlighter yes
you can
absolutely Stevie's girl says to make
highlighted more intense try using a
cream one first and apply powder one
over top row coffee shy nice job Stevie
I love that tip that's great
amanda says did anyone see the wet and
modest releasing two new shades of
cyclic low high leaders yes it was in
order
yes yeah these are all really poppy
really really beautiful I also recently
got this one from Becca this is the opal
flashes JZ since you're sleeping
expensive I only got one but I'll show
you what it looks like I'm just debating
whether I want to do a whole review of
these or not I'll put it over here
the best place to watch what I do really
really like this a lot really like this
Rihanna what's enough boxycharm is worth
it yes 150 million percent yes
the boxycharm we just got in the mail is
stupid
like stupid in a good way like I don't
even know like how they get away with
twenty one dollars on that box if you
see if you're curious look at the most
recent boxy charm and Oh Andrea Mitchell
y'know just Andrea Andrea Andrea Natalia
no yes just in an unboxing of hers and
she talks about the spoiler gets in it I
don't want to talk about it just in case
you don't like spoilers but it's an epic
spoiler for infer next month spa so this
would be the time to sign up for it if
you're gonna sign up for it I do want to
disclose though that I know the owner of
boxycharm since their second box I've
been getting it for reviews of their
second box but I will tell you when it's
junked and I have told you multiple
times in the past when it has not been
my favorite so I do believe the box of
charm is better than Pepsi yes it is
more expensive though but for what you
get you get a lot more stuff but a lot
of people have told me that they don't
use the stuff that's in boxycharm as
like but it almost like you sometimes
they send boxes of things that they
won't use I don't think so it's not
about $21 so what I would recommend
doing is going to the box of charm
website and there's a place where you
can click on past boxes and look and see
what's been in the past boxes that will
fall
you decide your sole topic right now but
I'm really excited about my box of Tron
he said he wants to talk about Mary Lou
cuz you know I'm gonna bring out Mary
Lou Ksenia there she is there she is
boom Mary Lou yes this is the original
Holy Grail highlighter for me
yes Oh fabulous fabulous fabulous
fabulous love it mary lou manizer is
just it's epic and again make sure you
use these on your eyes as well this is
another one I've really been enjoying
this is the Milani day glow strobe
lights instant glow powder these are
really good I just move around to my
other arm at this point we're gonna be
backwards watching yeah this is the
Milani one I got this for PR but I'm not
being paid her and then give me mileage
sunniness well maybe I got it if C or
something I know I didn't pay for it
it's well thankful but it's really
really pretty so that's a good drugstore
option oh talking about tips for how to
wear this subtly so what I would
recommend if you're gonna wear a
highlighter in a more subtle way is
don't do what all the beauty gurus do
and put it down your nose and put it
like on your Cupid's bow and and your
chin off don't do that don't do that if
you do be settle I personally feel like
this is my opinion and it's okay to
disagree with me that doesn't mean that
you're wrong and I'm right
I don't think you're wrong if you
disapprove me I feel like that the only
time that a glowy highlighter looks good
on the nose and the Cupid's bow in the
chin is on Instagram photos I don't
think that looks good in real life I
don't think it looks good at all I think
it looks horrible and that's just my
opinion
but I do like it just a little bit of
shine right here on the cheekbones and
if you want to go a little extra wild
Chad you can check to see if the
ingredients are lip safe most
highlighters are lip safe because the
red pigments are usually the big bad in
the knot is it red
that's an eye shadow no it's greens and
blues
it's the ferric ferrocyanide
the aquamarines that are usually the
ones that are not lips safe so you know
green highlighters you probably want
stay away from but it's not usually in
highlighters like this you can take your
regular lipstick and just pop a little
bit right here and just kind of my mom
and it'll give you that glow and pop of
your lips it's just a way to kind of
suddenly bring some pop to your lips
Jenna says I don't like highlight
mustache yes yes Rose says I love that
you do real-life makeup girlfriend if I
could do not your life makeup I probably
to its head to be honest that's why I do
feel like makeup but that's the only
thing I know how to do that says I still
put it on my nose
LM lmao but I just with everything left
in my up after I brush on my sheets
girlfriend YouTube you if you'd like to
put if you're watching this I am not
judging you if you like to put highlight
on your nose you can do that and I was
talking about shimmery highlight is
won't let these poppy shimmer glowy
highlights if you're using a Mac I like
to highlight those places on you that's
not what I'm talking about I'm talking
about like the shimmery glow I don't
know maybe it's because I like I feel
like it accentuates like it makes my
nose work huge maybe that's why I'm
biased against it again this is just my
so I'm not I still love you if you do
that I'm not judging you please continue
to do what makes you happy yet please
please please do what makes you happy
um but anyway okay so highlighters that
everybody in the collective brain
recommends I would love to know your
thoughts
kate says I think note I think
highlighter on the nose looks golden
capping lights but everyone's good off
her yes exactly
because she's on YouTube so many videos
if you saw her and you don't like with
that highlight on your nose you may
think something different I don't know
I've only met her once and I don't
remember sync I later than those
whatever so this doe says I'm not
offending just saying if you go
overboard very fast Cerebus says joues
highlight is nice - fantastic
surely he says I'm in a market full of
highlights I'm over here like now I'm
good Ivy says subtle all over highlight
glam glow moisturizer nice high
Sheila Sheila says shimmering highlight
under the nose can look like a runny
nose
agreed crazy speedier he says I have a
small nose and I'm dry against my face
like you do you girlfriend
and it's as I love highlighting nose
under the eyes and cheeks is like okay
go for it
go for it I don't I personally don't
like it or me Holly says Rudolph nose
lol not always a bad thing okay skip
down again goodness I hate this jatts oh
there we go
so um Sabrina the makeup mom says I love
using that highlight on my nose yeah
that's different Jenna says use the
Tarte smart palette wait please Jen USD
that Tarte palette shadows opaque the
shadows are opaque in the Tarte palette
that's true
they are my problem with this palette
was that they all kind of money together
on the eye that was my big issue with it
but it is a good palette again I feel
like in review I am rated it a little
bit too low I look back and go boo
jane says makeup revolution fantastic
rachel says color pops milk money
absolutely oh oh for us I meant to bring
out some Oprah highlighters Oprah Rodeo
Drive was just recommended by someone
before it skipped down that KJ says
subtle highlight benefits dandelion
Natasha - no no by some group swarupa
Maggie says Urban Decay's sin as a
highlight and I do have the Urban Decay
highlight in sin it's a lot like mary
lou manizer in my opinion they found the
exact dupe but it's really stinking
close so this is another good one but it
gets pretty pricey
it was an impulse buy that I almost took
back highlight overload lately yeah City
of the salic sent them over the
highlight trend and overdramatic contour
I think if it's on its way out I think
Kathryn says I feel like highlighting
makes my texture shot more and I
definitely agree that it can definitely
make um pores - especially show up a lot
more it depends on the hilar though I
really some accentuated more than others
Megan says Anasazi Beverly was moonchild
palette for different colors there you
go Karen I look funny with highlight on
my nose
but I love highlight yeah yep yep yep
all right let's go ahead and move on I'm
sorry if I didn't read your comment it
was skipping all over the place so I
apologize but instead okay let's go
ahead and move on to blushes and of
course the blushes are not going to be
highlighted but like great bold really
poppy but I feel like these are
definitely ones that are blendable that
they don't give you immediate
clown-faced that you can't work with so
I already talked about through the word
dollar in papaya I also want to show you
this one this is by essence this is the
blush up powder blush and this is in the
shape heatwave this thing is so pretty I
loved it it's got the ombre effect here
and especially it means such an
inexpensive brands so you've got kind of
an orange side and then you've got a
pink side and then you can put them
together and why did I click upon this
when um when I know very well I gotta
get more product coming in I know very
well that I don't have room on this on
this arm I should have swatch with my
other hands so those are the three
change you can get and these are at full
of pigmentation so they're not gonna
look like that on the cheeks so these
are matte they're not shimmery but they
are definitely bold and bright I love
this at the summer blush it just screams
summer to me if you have a five below
near you the city color blushes are
wonderful I think you can get these also
on the city color website but these are
will be leaving that leave pigmented you
do have to go in with a light hand with
your brush but they are wonderful I
think they're like six dollars on the
website but I think they're like three
or four at the store they're really good
what are their blushes that they're
growing out I guess there's the only
ones that I've thrown out as far as like
super bright coffee while I had backup
blushes over here but even now oh oh
makeup revolution makeup revolution ones
are really good as well I posted up my
brush into that one real good alright
I'll compare that next to the city color
do I have any mark do I have any reviews
of mark Jacob left in general I don't
have any reviews but I can tell you that
you like them I don't know if they're
worth the price just because I know if
any blush is what's up right but I
really like them okay so those are this
is the makeup revolution and then this
bottom one is the city color and they're
beautiful they're absolutely beautiful
Briana favorite metallic foiled
eyeshadows we actually already went
through those Brianna but I will tell
you very quickly I really like a steal
us and I love the Jew vias place from
the calyx also called written from the
pallets I'm going to show you those I
hate to admit I hate to admit it I hate
to I'm gonna just know that it pains me
my heart to admit this but the Jeffers
star ones are also really really good I
got the beauty killer Talladega to fold
you want it it's a fantastic palette
full the full review will give you my
whole impressions on that on ham but you
know at least at the time I don't know I
don't like to talk about him because
it's like you know talking about
politics he's like our politics you know
when you when you bring up you know
American politics and how everybody goes
wow it's like that's the same thing
happens when you bring up Jeffrey
started they kind of so I don't really
like talking about just starts too much
trouble
but but anyway he does make really good
I show is just so you know if that's
something you're interested in if it's
not something you're interested in
that's okay too
don't yell nemesises gb/s place blushes
are nice matte blushes Tarth Tarth NARS
Taj Mahal Jenny says I do use some
shimmer blesses blushes makeup equal
romance is my favorite Polly says NARS
makes cheap NARS made heath mistake oh
talking about the selling in China thing
Susan says lorac Pirates of the
Caribbean is one of the best palette to
be here the blessed palette is amazing
really good I wouldn't say that it's
super full woman poppy though like so I
have it but I wasn't adequately putting
into this categories being super super
bold Jenna wants to know if I tried the
androgyny palette know I have it if
somebody had sent it to me four
reviewers
thing or somebody sent it to me that
would be fine but I'm not going to send
anything from Jeffrey started just not
going to him don't stop it make yourself
uncomfortable stop talking about it jack
oh okay anyway so those are all the
blushes that I had to talk about
everybody's talking about NARS and them
song in China urban decay quickie blush
is hot pink nice okay so it is 1041 I
still want to talk about ellipse so I've
got some lip recommendations for you
speaking of Pirates of the Caribbean by
lorac now this was very pricey I don't
know if I would buy another one of these
just because the price point makes me go
but I really love this I was surprised
how much I liked it now I don't
necessarily like the shame that I picked
out because the shade on the website
looked different than what I've got I
have a full review of the whole to rock
pirates a collection that you can
definitely watch the scene all of my
opinions all of this this one's kind of
gray this one is in the shade Sparrow I
think you can only get this on the lorac
website but it's really creamy really
really nice and then this is why I
included this in the pot glow stuff
because this is an iridescent lip topper
kind of lip gloss you can see that but
there's a good iridescent ship to it and
it's so beautiful I'd use this a lot
over other lipsticks not this one
because this one is a little bit too
cool for me
you like it mixed gives me kind of dead
lip but um but yeah this one is
absolutely beautiful beautiful beautiful
also I'm going to show you the Rani
cosmetics lipsticks if you like that
sparkle and shine
need I also did a full review on in
shawnee did send these to me Shawny is a
youtuber who started her own lipstick
line she's about to come out with liquid
lipsticks with the spark dazzling liquid
lipsticks I don't even know what the
thing it made my mind go I can't even
believe it she's doing my like I'm just
like I cannot wait to see them so anyway
these right here have a little bit of
sparkle in them let me see if I have a
spot on his forearm I don't so that
question of Karen just put it on the
other arm it's not that big
okay so let's put it so I brought out I
just don't like swatch it with my left
hands okay this is tattoo and then this
one is clips now these were designed for
people with medium to deep skin to us
but people's like skin tones can
definitely wear them but they have this
glitter base in them and one thing I
really appreciate about these is you
don't feel the glitter on your lips when
you're applying it like it's not a rough
or anything the lasting power for me is
really really good and also the glitter
doesn't stay on your lips at least for
me beyond the lipstick so as the color
fades so does the glitter because the
worst thing for me is like the frog
thread collection from lipstick Queen
the lip gloss is really sick of weird
and it's got these green glitters in it
that will stay on your lips beyond the
lipstick so you put on the lip gloss and
we've got this weird wash of green which
looks like dark green which is really
weird and then as it wears down like if
your lipstick is gone you still see
specks and threw it on your lips that
does not happen with these this it fades
the glitter fades down with the lipstick
which i think is super awesome and I
find these to be very unique I've heard
that you can get lipsticks like this in
India that it's a trend and we got to
get lipsticks like this but I don't know
that for a fact
and I'm starting to see other brands
start to come out with lipsticks like
this so I'm excited for you Shani that
she uh she brought it to the US and I
haven't seen too many people too many
brands in the u.s. wasn't seen any
brands in the u.s. doing this but
they're absolutely beautiful I totally
recommend they also have a mild scent
though so if you're if you don't like
scent they do have sent in the full
review I talk about what all of the
scents are and strengths of each scent
so if you are sensitive the scent I
definitely recommend you watch that full
review because it goes into more details
about that other lips metallic lips Oh
from makes really good metallic you'll
get liquid lipsticks so does on OCC the
lip tars are wonderful you know I kind
of stepped away from the lip tars when
they were in the tubes they were just
too messy I couldn't handle it and then
when they came out in they were like in
like a little bottle squeezy tubes and
now they're in the regular - what's the
doe foot applicator and for whatever
reason I just didn't buy them and then
when I was at IMATS
I decided to break down and shred them
because I've never tried them before and
I really liked the blonde I'm gonna put
it right here of course this is wet but
it's just that really nice metallic
shine we really really like it a lot
mermaid and the marina says which is the
best halo lip topper what I do for like
the halo lip thing is I use a
highlighter I do want to warn you though
against the Bekaa one the new Becca
iridescent lip stoppers I personally
don't like them at all they blend right
into the lipstick that I'm wearing like
don't even if you apply those things
don't even rub your lips together don't
eat it because that your Dessen's is
completely gone you can get it to stay
on as long as your lips don't touch
together but do not recommend those
they're very expensive please don't buy
them in my opinion they don't work at
all of course you can feel free to do
you review your your research from other
people and get other opinions but my
recommendation is please don't buy them
they are I mean like hurting in my heart
that I bought them and I'm probably
going to return them I do have some
information coming out on them soon so I
think my next video I talked about those
two lip toppers me oh they're just not
good but there was a Mac one that
someone recommended to me at generation
beauty and I can't remember what it is
but it's gonna be in that video that's
coming out early next week I have my
June favorites and fails video coming
out next week so more information in
that video I just don't remember what it
was called but it's in the video Holly
says Oh for a great I wish the words had
less expensive I agree I do I wish that
they were like $15 what 15 would make me
feel a little bit better but one think
it's like that 17 18 starts making me go
you know like karen says touch and solar
a beautiful shine you know
my friend Nancy did send me a couple of
Metuchen soul it's a Korean brand they
sell it at Sephora I had a really hard
time with the formula of that I didn't
enjoy it but it may just be my skill
that I'm just not up for it
I'm just not that's the older maybe
that's why maybe other people can do it
better than I can um crazy speedy review
says necromancy cosmetic I have matte
lipsticks in bullet form last forever
and so comfortable so great to know
Karen says touch and so on revlon has
some glitter and you know i had bad luck
with both of those I really did and I'm
so sorry I did I did not enjoy either
one mary says that in shawnee nail that
I feel like so too and Stevie says he
beats girl I always forget what your
real name is you told me like a million
times and I forget every stinking time I
think it's me no where am I
I know you've told me like 15 million
times Jane Allen yes it does seem to
help I don't even know who you're
respond Deborah says those lipstick look
beautiful where can I get them I think
you're talking about the ishani ones the
ironic paws metics it's ronnie cosmetics
calm and he actually needs to learn
she's amazing I think she had a sale
recently to the fourth of July so sign
up for her emails and you can probably
get um if you don't want to buy them at
full price keep an eye out for sales
Arwen says what about the Urban Decay
ones I have not tried the Urban Decay
lot of urban decay newer products for
lips I have some of their old the
revolution lipsticks I have a ton of
those but I haven't gotten any recently
so I can't speak to those unfortunately
leave thanked or Lia was literally oh
now I can't remember oh my gosh I'm a
terrible terrible friend here Oh Annie's
here hi Annie hi Annie
and he says and who see your comics I'm
sorry Eddie and he's the sparrow mine
quick dose of colors dose of colors
liquid lipsticks I really really love I
don't know if I would call them these
the shades that I have aren't super
poppy but I
like the formula a lot it makes me happy
Megan says I got one of the new urban
decay heat lipsticks if you talk about
the cold glitter i swatched them at
generation Beauty at our Creator day
that we had urban decay was there and I
got the opportunity to swatch them I was
kind of hoping that they would give us
some lipsticks but they didn't and uz
stoppers don't dry down on mood good to
know thank you free I appreciate that
Lauren says got to try those jus a lip
cream and rose gold eggs yes those who
ate lip creams are great there's one
that I want to show you in particular
and I know where it is this one right
here found it okay it takes too long for
me to find something I usually let go
this is called tan lines
this one is wonderful I'm gonna put that
over top of let's put it it's but it's
over top of this eye shadow that doesn't
blend that very well that looks terrible
that was a horrible idea
why would I put a gold over a pink like
that I don't know that did not work okay
let's try this again thanks the way that
that looks it's really really nice for
that pop of color and the scent that pop
of shine in the middle of the lips which
is a great way to wear these old poppy
colors keeping the ombre lips are so
difficult they're really really not
they're super easy the way that I do on
berry lips is I take my dark shade I put
it all over my lips and then I take a
light shade and just pop it in the
center and go ma and I'm done and then
sometimes I have to kind of blend a
little bit on the side just a little bit
just to kind of blend it in but it's
super easy to do and there's lots of
other techniques that make it more
complicated where you're like adding
extra here and all that stuff I'll do
all that but I feel like my armory lips
look pretty stinkin good so and I do it
easy and I like it so crazy Beauty
review wants to know if there's you a
lift upwards drive down I don't think so
no IVA says I got the unicorn chopper
and I think I think it looks cool nice
arvind says are you going to MTV New
York yes I should be a generation
City absolutely that is my plan speaking
of unicorn toppers this is a classic
this is people Auguste is a classic at
this point it's unicorn tears by Too
Faced oh this one is lipstick E so it
definitely doesn't dry down that's it
what can I put this over but never
something stupid again actually that
doesn't look that bad anymore it was
pretty bad for a second but then look
too bad anymore okay I'll just put it
over here to show you on the side so
it's right there and I do have a full
video on this that I did a year or two
ago and awesome and what I did was I did
a bunch of lipstick swatches on my lips
and then I put this over top so you can
see the transformation this one I really
really love and this is something you
can do to just put a little bit in the
center and blend it out without doing a
ton of it because I do want to give you
those tips on how to make it like just a
little tiny bit inside doing a full
poppy glow and I think you can do to
make it a little more subtle is to just
use one of these you know you do a
neutral matte eye and then do a poppy
lip you know so that you you know
overwhelm your face if you just want to
do something a little more subtle Megan
so she lost her unicorn tears oh no
Susan says I've been dying to try the
hood of you do lip toppers yeah I
haven't tried those either Susan says
what if you do lip top-40 I haven't
tried them there's so much makeup out
there you know Arwen says OMG they're
coming out with unicorn tears and new
latex form we're so excited yeah I saw
that I don't know what happened there
where I was thinking about purchasing
that and then I saw the thing why all
the other liquid latex is not that one
and I had to get back to check to see if
it's there at this point and he says
unicorn tears is amazingly cool I
totally agree yeah it's it's really
Shelly says I was debating I'm going to
gem TV now I have to go to see you all
surely I would love to see you too
it was funny I was in Toronto at
generation beauty and I'm on Instagram
and it was on Instagram live I was I was
an Instagram live and I'm Instagram
lining and all of a sudden
runs up and she comes and gives me a hug
I saw the humor in here and she came and
found me like she was watching my
Instagram live and that she came and
found where I was based on like my
background I'll adjust the fit beauties
here check out her YouTube channel the
Newark Avenue Quan lip toppers are
gorgeous yes nice to see you Jessica
I've never seen you in live chat it's so
good to have you here James talking
about makeup forever something um Julie
wants to know when is Jen Beauty New
York City I think that it's it's in the
fall it's usually October but it may be
September I'm not quite sure if you go
to UM if you search for Generation V New
York City you should be able to find the
date this is the time to buy tickets
because I think they're a look real
quick because I'm curious now I put the
UM Jen you need New York City because
the tickets keep steadily going up so
right now tickets are there $99 right
now so they'll go up to 169 so right now
they're 99 its September 23rd to 24th
the early Access Pass is $39 that gets
you in I think an hour early um when we
sing it says early edge Oh 10:00 a.m. so
get you in an hour early so you can hit
up all the views before the mad rush of
people so yeah that's that's the early
access you can do that if you want to
not wait in as many long lines because
you have to wait in lines to do the
different activities and things but
honestly I have to tell you what
generation Beauty if you're gonna do
since we're kind of done with this
thought they'll go off topic for a
second
no promo code you just go to I all I did
was Google search for generation beauty
in New York City clipped by now and it's
$99 instead of a 169 at least in Toronto
if this is the way things are going to
keep going the way that it was was that
the goodie bag you get at the ends is
full with all of these awesome things
and then you can wait in line to get
smaller things and our giveaways do
lovely things like they were doing
at one of the booths they were doing lip
lip art at Smashbox
you can wait line to do things like that
but the real goody good good stuff comes
in your bag at the end of you beds will
you get all these full-sized parts that
I for the Toronto bags were amazing for
the attendees so but yeah so I'm
definitely planning on going Geoff's I
hope you can be there too I would love
to go to drag punching I would
absolutely love that would be amazing I
I would love that
hopefully one day I'll get to go
Sharon's has anyone tried the new Revlon
liquid lipsticks with her metallic
finish are they any good as an
affordable option if you have tried them
and you're watching this on the replay
definitely leave your thoughts in the
comments below um but I've showed you
everything that's here on my table I
don't think there's anything I've left

talk about for like the next five
minutes or so
Jessica wants know if I've done all
judge Beauty locations now yes I suppose
like there's give me a Midwest one I
thinking in like Texas or somewhere or
somewhere in Texas either and they're
working on that so I haven't been done
that favorites on that gap but I've done
New York I've done Toronto I've done San
Francisco and I've done Los Angeles so
and I love them I absolutely love them
Rihanna says did you like Jim Keating
New York or Toronto better New York
Toronto the problem for me in Toronto
was that all the people that worked for
the branch were all Canadian
representatives so they couldn't really
help me as an American like they
couldn't like they hadn't passed my
information to the American person news
lady so I probably won't go back to
Toronto to be honest so Smashbox slip
art yes it was awesome and there's some
pictures of me on my instagram my
instagram is just gentle eyes reviews
there's some pictures of my infamous lip
look that they did on my instagram so
why aren't there any in Chicago I don't
know I don't know let's say why nothing
LA or San Francisco it if the bigger
event is Los Angeles the venue is bigger
San Francisco is a what's really cramped
there were a lot of people it was really
crayons so I personally like Los Angeles
better yeah yeah I don't know if they'll
do a Chicago one they I think they're
trying to do as many cities as they
possibly can I've to Revlon HD matte lip
colors Jasmine says and I think they are
patchy definitely have to put over on
that color interesting stuff says I'm
telling you Jack you can wear glitter
lip and convention with all those people
you can be public well you know I mean
it was different when it's like in a
makeup thing to wear like glitter and
this is the thing about the glitter on
the lips
it's like EPS eating it like I kept
accidentally getting some of my mouth
and you know like if you go to the beach
and you get your like outside with sand
or whatever and everyone smile you get
like a little and you're like fine china
piece of sand and it's so nasty that's
what was happening with the bitter is it
came to me I was just kind of going and
like punching on a piece of glitter and
it was so gross so I had to take it off
as soon as I got in the car that was
like the first thing I did I reach into
my husband's glove box and grab like a
McDonald's napkin you know we've ever
done God like public have been thrown
the glove box
so I think we went in there to use a
bathroom we don't really done McDonald's
too often but but anyways I've got the
napkin and I wiped it off and it was
like a mess on my face it look like I
just eaten a rabbit like y'all okay
there's like blood everywhere
it was awful because I had lipstick
everywhere so it took a while for me to
get it off but my husband like me but
how did you do that why did you take
that off of me because I just didn't
want the glitter on my lips anymore it
was just too much
so Jennifer says we need a DC DMVs that
would be amazing
DC or Baltimore oh my gosh that would be
awesome
because I wouldn't have to travel
anywhere Sharon says yeah I heard the HD
Revlon's didn't have too many good
reviews for the metal ones are new I
wonder if those are any better the
colors look nice they do look
nice Jane wants know if I use the NYX
glitters I've tried using NYX glitters I
find things really look literally
because there's they're loose they're
really loose so you have to get
something to really adhere it or else
they just fall everywhere either super
loose you know like a lot of glitters
are just littering in a two thing
crazies beauty review says steel lip
toppers are comfortable dry down and
can't fill the glitter but only two
colors available interesting to know
justice does glitter lips you're
gorgeous but OMG yes it's awful in their
mouth there's an any brand that supposed
to stay really that's good to know
yes to DC Mon 420 love Beauty I forget
that I have that I have that glitter on
my lips so I'll be like why are my lips
so crusty I know and it's and it feels
weird because when it's on your lips and
your lips are kind of the one like this
as you're talking you can feel it kind
of expanding and contracting and it's
it's a weird feeling so robust does he
never do DC Maryland yep you're right
because New York is so close I don't
know they don't they want now actually
what's really pretty now the pink with
that gold topper I actually really like
that now at first I hated it but it's
really not that bad alright it is 1101
