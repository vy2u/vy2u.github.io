the makeup chat it is so good to be here
I'm a little confused right now because
I don't see anybody in the actual chat
so I don't know if there's something
wrong with it or what it doesn't seem to
be posting to anybody so I'm hoping now
that I'm like that now it is posting I'm
gonna text real quick my production
manager and just see I'm gonna tell her
I'm live now oh there we go there they
are
who've been showing up who's making me
really really nervous for a second but
it looks like now that I'm live
it's posting oh my gosh cuz I got it
ready and sitting here for like 20
minutes oh that's good that's good so
today we're gonna be talking about
natural makeup product last week we
talked about bold makeup products the
highlights from space and all kinds of
bold bright colors and all that we
talked about all that but this week
we're gonna go natural and I am their
natural thing as you can tell like I
usually am in chat and of course I have
to do my little disclaimers if you do
not like the live chat format and then
I'm going to be talking to people that
you cannot see I will read you what
they're saying but if you don't like
that this may not be the best video for
you to start with I tons of other
content it's not like chat please feel
free to check out all of that but I
personally love this format so I'm gonna
go ahead with it and hope that you
enjoyed it as well and also I don't want
makeup in this video because I stay up
late on Saturday nights to get
everything together for what's the
makeup and last night was especially
late because I was procrastinating and I
wasn't feeling well earlier in the day
so it ended up being like 3 a.m. day and
it was about 3/4 of it was completely me
procrastinating no makeup do you ever
feel like that like you're having a good
face day like some days you're like oh
my face looks busted and then some days
you're like my face actually looks ok
today yeah I'm doing alright maybe just
the lighting from you and the lights in
them window gets helping but I'm gonna
take just
second I'm gonna say hello to the
collective brain we are gonna get their
opinion on natural products which makes
this even better that's why one big
reason why I love chat is because it's
not just my opinion it's the opinion of
about 200 other people which you know I
I feel like I know a lot of stuff but I
don't know as much as two hundred people
do may only to think of things I
wouldn't have thought I may mention
products I've never tried them so it's I
think it's better to have them than just
me go wrong all right I'm gonna go ahead
and say hi to them real quick because
they're amazing it's the collective
brain of leg of Awesomeness if I can
find the top here we go alright so it
looks like Amanda's heroes is here

palettes I've got lip products I've got
highlighters I've got blushes I've got
all kinds of natural stuff to share with
you so just a v UT is here a coffee Jack
finally making me beginning live so
happy to have you
never make you check out just v you DS
channel she's got a great YouTube
channel alright so let's start with
foundation so for me personally when I
look for something that's more of a
natural foundation foundation I look for
a BB cream typically BB creams are
lighter coverage they contain SPF and
they're all over fabulous you can build
up a lot of BB creams to a more medium
coverage but you can also do it nice and
light leave when Keeley or Lea Seabees
grow every time every baking time I have
to ask you the same questions and it's
awful Julie says my audios off today I
do apologize I have completely misplaced
my microphone I did have a one of those
musical a lavalier microphones when
those little ones and I could eat
misplace it so I do apologize if the
sound is a little bit off so let's talk
a little bit about BB cream so these are
my two current favorite BB creams this
one I just got at generation Beauty this
is from pure lease which I didn't even
know that they made BB creams this is
fabulous it's a really really nice it
says tinted more screen SPF 30
you can't build this up to medium
coverage which is really really really
nice I really love that lock also the
r-mo BB cream is another one that I've
been absolutely loving I love the
Garnier BB cream I ran out of it did not
repurchase it just because I didn't eat
it but I love that beauty cream that's
another one that's fabulous let's look
at the collective brain they're giving
some great suggestions I've saw some
lutein a cesspool he is always with us
he's always asking about you and telling
you to let you know how beautiful you
are
oh thank you William I appreciate that
she Diaries is talking about the elf BB
cream shake Shan said the flower beauty
BB cream from Walmart is great Tiffany
wants to know
Tiffany John check out her YouTube
channel have you tried the PTR BB cream
I mean PRC People's Republic of China
no PTR not Physicians Formula what's PTR
I don't know what that is it's not
cooking in my head good morning to
Lindsey
let's see it's a silent Haley thank you
so much Lee I appreciate it I had a
friend and I'm not just gonna leave it
spelled it the same way you do
why can't I remember this why can't I
remember all right uh Haley says she
loves it there at least one and I'm
working Jessica loves the Loreal BB
cream sherry loves the Garnier Ashley
loves the dr. jart Beth is anyone Nova
silicone free BB cream then look at
these who's don't have the full
ingredients on the oil so I would check
I don't know well I don't know one
specifically I'd have to really look out
for it
Amanda said she loved the up one for a
Cabos skin the sunscreen burns her eyes
she looking for similar formulas for a
foundation for dry skin if you have any
specific questions about specific
products for different skin tones skin
types things like that that I may not be
the best place to ask that is the ones
that they make up Facebook group it's
groups slash what to put makeup on
Facebook they know everything there's
somebody there that has your skin tone
there's somebody there that has your
skin type and there's probably about at
least 20 or 30 of them that will answer
you baby thing over there it's a good
day burst through the people they really
are wonderful it does take a little
while to get in because we have people
who view because we want to make sure
that we have great people in there we
have a new system where you have to
answer some questions going to get it
makes you answer all three questions it
cuts down on the time to let you know
that says BB creams and CC creams are
always too dark on her so she has no
suggestions yeah I know is that good a
lot of BB and CC creams they don't make
like a super fair they also not seem to
make super dark either they it's more
like lights like medium medium and they
kind of stop I guess that's because of
the Korean history of it with typical
Korean skin tones maybe that's why but
it's an American brand I would hope that
they would spend their shade range but
you know well I have another option for
you it BB creams are not good for you
it's powder foundations
powder foundations I find don't last as
long for me without any kind of base or
what I'll do if I
want to use a powder foundation but it
don't use a BB cream as I'll just put on
a moisturizer before or it's into
moisturizer wait for it and it kind of
gives it something to stick to
so I'll wash my face I'll cleanse my
face and make sure that I've got like a
nice hydrating moisturizer on and then
they seem to work better on me when my
skin is really hydrated
I got the toothpaste one here the cocoa
powder foundation I also got the bare
minerals their pro in warm light both
these are really really nice I like both
of them the toothpaste one is a mission
light medium for me Seth says because
light and fair is such a broad term as
is deep this is deep so yeah those are
my two that I use all the time
it cosmetics Tina recommends very good
yes it did I say that right I hope I did
it cosmetics CC cream has the best
coverage of high SPF yes well we're
looking for a light coverage today but I
totally agree with you that sees that
because my CC cream has a great coverage
absolutely totally agree see amanda says
primer helps your powder foundation last
longer absolutely totally agree
Lindsay says the Herb Orion BB cream is
great and fair Wheaton says powder
beauty powder foundations with SPF are
great for sunscreen application nice you
know I've never thought about that
powder foundations are great with SPF
sunscreen for fusion that makes sense
because you put on your sunscreen and
then pick the powder foundation at the
top of that nice Tara says Tarte BB
cream is on the lighter side on combo
hit suits me nicely very good awesome
okay let's go ahead and move on to the
next category I'm gonna put these down
and actually I'm gonna put them away
because I don't think this huge mess
everywhere after I do the chat and I
just drop them in this horrible clip big
of a mess it only takes a second can we
walk over there just drop anymore okay
so let's now talk about well what I'm
really excited about of course is
eyeshadow because there's no eyeshadow
junkie so I have tons of eyeshadow
palettes I'll show you these have been
my holy grail of neutral eyeshadow
palettes for a really long time the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and the
Naked 2 Papa Urban Decay
I have to tell you though it's
unbecoming less in love with these as
I've used more makeup and more products
it's not that these are bad products
because they're not bad products for me
it's just I don't feel like they're as
mind-blowing as they were when I first
purchased them if that makes sense this
was my very first high-end eyeshadow
palette that I bought it is very old I'm
not getting rid of it my booty call fell
out I know my booty call so that's one
that's not there I this really helped
inspire me to make me feel like I could
do a shadow because before that all I
had ever used was like covergirl pilot's
Revlon colics and I struggled on I
struggled and I thought that it was just
me but it wasn't me it was the
eyeshadows so when I got ahold of The
Naked Urban Decay Naked basics - not
many places Urban Decay Naked 2 palette
it kind of opened up a whole new world
for me and that was when I really knew
that I could do a makeup channel on
YouTube so so yeah I'm just gonn want to
know about cushion foundations I haven't
found any that I'm in love with so you
know that's just me personally I'm gonna
get there Amanda I'm thinking about you
it's sitting right here so yeah so I'm
not is I mean these are still good
they're still really good and especially
if you want that chocolate set show you
the inside the chocolate bar palette and
just in case you haven't seen it I think
a ton of looks out of this but I feel
like this is more of more I guess
because I'm personally more into like
the pop and stuff lately which is not
natural so I guess these would be better
I don't know I just feel like especially
this one I don't I don't know there's
not knocking my socks off anymore maybe
I'm just bored with them so I've had
them for so long I don't know I don't
know there's just something about it's
not I don't know do you feel the same
way that they're just not super Wow
anymore so all right speaking of alpha
talents because I got people talking
about the alpha cos I've got the Alpha
needed nude palette this is my favorite
of you smaller elf pilots I did get the
one that was the rose nudes one I didn't
find that one to be high quality in my
opinion this one's really good
I like the matte one as well I don't
feel like the last
how Romney's is as good as high-end
shadows but you can get the same kind of
look the blend ability is fantastic and
I really do like these little elf
palette either $6 each I believe or
they're 10 are they six are they 10 you
can 10 their 10 the bronze are in
highlight palettes those are six these
are 10 but I do really really like these
a lot especially if you are not
interested in spending a lot of money my
shadow I would definitely recommend
getting these over a lot of drugstore
palettes absolutely suddenly says I
think we become where we're gonna make
about there well I'll agree I agree one
thing I wanted to remind you of that
some of you probably don't need
reminding but just in case you do if
you're looking for a good natural
eyeshadow palette a contour palette is a
great way to get an eyeshadow look
without getting an extra product so I
just got this one from NYX this is the
highlight and contour pro palette this
one is really really nice and it's a
neutral eyeshadow palette with giant
pans that's all it is
I'm not neutral but natural I'm less a
mutual some of them have some warmth or
some components to it but but yeah so I
definitely think about using your
contour palette as double duty for
contour and highlighting and for your
eyes so this is one option for that
another one I really like from NYX that
actually let just a little bit better
than that one in the love contours all
palette because it's got this purple in
here that I really like and it's got a
little bit of shimmer and shine in it
where that one is on that I'm not a big
fan of the brow shades up here very much
but I do really like all of the other
shades in here this one I would
definitely get over that one if you want
more options if you just want something
simple I would get the pro one if you
want something that's got a little bit
more as a look I would definitely
recommend this one I also have the one
from makeup revolution
this one is fabulous these highlights
are a little bit really they're kind of
poppy but the matte ones are really
really good for a nice natural look so
this one is called the ultra contour
palette that's a really good one I also
have the Kat Von D shade + light if you
want to go high ends this is a really
really good one I find that this one
doesn't last as long on my cheeks as
some other products other contour
products but this one is
really good as far as the sheeny tony's
and all of that are like a lot and then
this one was the other one I brought out
which was the elf woman oh this is the
elf highlight palette yes this is the
elf highlight palette so you can also do
this as eyeshadow as well it's it's just
the bronzer palette I don't feel like is
as good a quality as this one and then
the contour one the bronzer one was like
wasn't so good for me I decluttered it
but this one is really nice to add color
on to your eyes as well don't feel like
you're limited to the cheeks okay so I
saw someone mentioned busy art I do have
one busier palette the only reason why I
own this is to think this was gifted to
me by someone that she got this and she
got it with the one shape broken so they
replaced it for her and she sent me the
one with the broken shade which I am so
so thankful because it gave me an
opportunity to try busy art shadows
every time I pick up a busy art shadow
pilant even in like holiday season I was
with my friend Nicola from the channel
yay or nay Nicole we were in San
Francisco together we were in the
Sephora I picked up the Bismarck palette
it was during the the holiday sale and
I'm like holding it in my hand and I'm
like I can't I can't it's too much money
it's too small and it's too much money I
can towards up put it back one day I
will break down and get more visit our
parents one day one day I will but this
one I really am enjoying even though it
looks like a hot mess I really am
enjoying it another one that my friend
Nancy was kind enough to send me is this
one by persona it's called the identity
palette oh my goodness this thing is if
this is a palette that never heard about
on YouTube I don't know how she found it
oh my gosh
I drink some these shades these settings
are so nice there are statins they're
not filled their size but they are
beautiful some people don't want to be
seen from space you know these are so
nice there's so nice and I really like
them it's matte looks a little chunky
but it blends out beautiful like I just
I just watched a little too far but oh
my gosh they're fabulous these this is a
really really nice palette I've been
neglecting it I need to
is it more more eyeshadow more eyeshadow
more eyeshadow I love Parrish nudes in
the busy art line nice that's good to
know
very good to know stuff thank you so
much for that I also brought out the
Urban Decay Naked basics palette so
these were my holy grail for the longest
time especially the Naked basics too
this is a fantastic I shadow palette I
can't say I'm out of love with this one
I'm still in love with this I really
like it Oh someone's asking huggies
asking I think you're asking about this
this is called persona and it's called
the identity palette and the website is
their Instagram persona Cosmetics WWE
are stone a cosmetics Co distributed
from Los Angeles so there you go
Facebook is persona cosmetics at USA
make it basics - great way to lay down a
natural base I just put up a tutorial
randomly because I'm trying to do some
type of tutorial and it got the best
reaction my tutorial that I put up other
people that watch it seem to have really
liked it of course there's a few people
that are like I'm Jack this is nothing
groundbreaking but the people that that
are getting something out of it are
really appreciative of it
it's just how to lay down unmute of like
a natural base and then change your look
with just one shadow so this is a great
palette for a laying down that face that
I talked about in the video the Urban
Decay Naked basics original one is the
this one here this one I don't like as
much just because I don't like the shade
range as much it's like light light
light it's like champagne light yellow
tone light peach tone light medium cool
tone neutral ish tone and then darker
and then black it's like I don't I just
don't want the color selection I think
that they really improved it on the
naked basics - I think they did much
better and then it's a range of colors I
like that much much better
Lynette says the persona powder is
always sold out whenever I try to
purchase it now
they're talking about what to make of
this week Jeffers start getting sued
again I don't think they have a case
just just like it almost makes me like
when somebody Sue's someone even though
I'm not gonna balk topic I okay real
quick I'm with gone topic geber stars
getting sued by lunatic labs cosmetics
these are the bullet shaped lipsticks
see the whole story and wants to make it
today but it's like almost makes me lose
some respect for lunatic labs because I
feel like they don't have a case they're
their lipstick I mean yes they're both
bullet shapes but they don't look
anything alike the lunatic ones are like
little thin at the top and the jeffree
star ones were big at the top I don't
know I don't get it I just I think that
just they're looking at Jeffery and all
of his money and they want it and that's
what it looks like to me that's from an
outward person it doesn't know either
partly it bothers me but anyway Oh Jen
says they have a version of the makeup
eraser in their dollar store that's very
cool alright back on topic you dude by
the balm yes this is a really really
really nice palette you got a few
shimmery shades here you've got some
shimmery deeper shades but you've also
got a lot of mattes in there to mix it
up this one is really really good
another drugstore one the original
reveal palette by Coastal Scents you can
get so we're just reading my friend Jen
on that okay we're the old pallet 20 I
shadow colors Coastal Scents the
original one I feel like is the best one
do not get the reveal 3 in my opinion
the revealed 3 by Coastal Scents to me
was not nearly as good as the 1 and the
2 the one that you were pretty good I
think these these can go on sale for
really really cheap and you get a ton of
Shadows they the glittery shimmery ones
do have some fallout so just be careful
they're very powdery kind of like lorac
shadows but you can work with them tap
off your brush it's definitely something
you can work with and you get a ton of
shades in high that's why I really love
the reveal cuff how many shade options
you have so there's a lot of colors that
are dupes in here for the urban decay
naked and make a two pilots not all of
it but some of it definitely recommend
this if you dig deep enough into my
channel I did a full review on it two
more eyeshadow palettes that are from
the dubious place from UB into I
couldn't find my original Nubian but I
like the
quality of this one just a little bit
better of course it does have some great
pops of color in it but it has some more
neutral skin more not neutral sing
neutral some more natural skin tones
especially if you have deep skin because
this one is going to be more deep skin
friendly for that natural look there
isn't really a lot of options for
lighter skin tones for the natural look
but I wanted to show this because the
quality is amazing I do really like the
original Nubian it gives us lighter skin
people a lot more options but I think
actually I think I do you know where it
is Toomas bag right there that I never
unpacked I can't be together for videos
and then I never unpack them here it is
this is the original Nubian by dubious
place this one right here so there's a
lot more option for lay your skin people
in this one but it's still more medium
to deep so it seemed to me friendly
definitely worth a purchase I think for
anyone and then the last one which you
guys know that I can't get away with
doing this video without showing the
Tarte clay flag because you guys know
this is my new favorite I showed every
single video can't stop with this thing
I'm in love with it it smells like
vanilla if you don't like that vanilla
scent you're not gonna like this because
every time I open it it gives me that
warmth of vanilla but it's getting up in
the morning and using a vanilla scented
eyeshadow palette just makes me happy
this one is really really good I've
talked about this thing's death so I'm
gonna put it back but this is my new
favorite neutral palette natural palette
not neutral neck it's real Fallot got
the contour shades there too but you can
use for eyeshadows and it's just super
fun I love it all right going to the
community now for some suggestion for
eyeshadow palettes I want to know from
you what you think let's say she diary
says the original new Venus
travel-friendly though that is very true
the only reason why I was really showing
the movie into was because I wasn't sure
women do mean one was and then I
remembered it where it was so pretty
yeah would you really like they're my
favorite eyeshadow brand right now by
the way Jimmy this place is just colored
rain would probably be up there too if
they've had more eyeshadow palettes
not with more pallets hey Emily how are
you oh did we talk about mr. comfort
zone for what Wow no we didn't talk
about comfort zone from wet and wild
I think it's buried in my drugstore
pallet floor over there but yes comfort
zone from wet wild is a great staple for
a collection I feel like you definitely
need to dig into other palettes as far
as like the brow bone she doesn't have a
really great brow bone shade but other
than that it's really really good
Jack Murphy and Jaclyn hill is so
awesome I do have a full review coming
out of the Jaclyn hill palette when I
get back no see I filmed swatches of it
that I'm trying to get up to you as soon
as possible I don't know when we're
going to get the full of you up before I
get back because I don't know I'm trying
really hard to get the four of you up
I'm ready to review it it's just there's
so much editing involved and I want to
get up so much stuff before then but
just as a preview for what I think about
a Jacqueline hell palette I'll get that
out for you there is there is a lot of
natural you can do with this but there's
also the pops of color I'll hold this up
for you so you've got a lot of Browns
and warmth a lot of warm brown over here
and then you've got kind of your like
clean corner over here
if you have the right primer these are
fabulous
they're amazing if you don't use a
primer if you use the wrong one just my
opinion it just kind of burned but I
really thought the primer is everything
with this I've been testing it on
snapchat they're not follow me on
snapchat I've been testing it every day
on snapchat showing you at the beginning
of the day the end of the day I've saved
the snap so I can put them in the full
video so you can see what it looks like
but their application wise a primer
doesn't seem to matter but when you put
it on your eyes and you leave it on
there the primer makes a huge difference
so that's kind of how I'm feeling about
that but yeah actually can get some very
nice natural books it does come out
again in two days the 18th is when it
comes out and I'm trying to get up the
swatch video before the 18th that's my
my goal best primer my favorite primer
is the Urban Decay's formula I really
love also Ulta brands Ulta brands is
almost an exact formula wise for Urban
Decay so I let the oats a brand new one
hope they keep discontinuing everything
I love Ulta brand so hopefully they mean
never discontinue that one but the alter
nude eye primer is fabulous and then the
Urban Decay primer picture they even
those are my two favorites lisa says
that she feels like wet and wild is much
better now against it says meet Matt
needed meet matrimony by the balm those
are very very good and Lee says a makeup
revolution chocolate vice palette is so
good fabulous I don't know anything
about that one Tammy says my lorac pro 2
is my favorite natural palette I use it
six days a week in one way or another
pull that one even though I really like
it just going to have a lot of colors in
it
thank you that is a fantastic palette
lisa says NARS okay I have the NARS pop
that I tried I haven't enjoyed as much
but I've heard a lot of people agree
with you 100% let's see who I'm missing
a lot of things Ivy says make Mac Paint
Pot um primer the shimmery ones for me
don't work but the matte ones like
painterly do work for me I did get a
shimmering one and I absolutely hated it
it creased it glitter fall out
everywhere it was awful I do not like I
forget what it was called but it was
terrible but the matte one in painterly
I need to get another one here to
reapply it Lynette said the Jacqueline
hope palette is really good with the
Tarte quality is better no I
I don't know for me personally I mean
I'd Winnett you totally right to your
opinion but I'm trying to think whether
I think that's true or not I like the
shade selection better in the tort play
play I'll tell you that but is it better
quality yes because doesn't matter what
primer you get with the Tarte part tort
doesn't matter what primer you put a
primer on it doesn't matter but the
Jacqueline hole you need to have a
specific layer but as far as blend
ability I find them to be easy
equally it's easy to work with that's
just my opinion okay you see any other
suggestions before we go AJ says love my
Tarte palette thank Jim for reviewing it
you are so welcome
Mac has natural times 15 Melissa wants
to get that people just stay away from
Lancome shadows sherry says drugstores
better I've heard bad things about
Lancome shadows i swatched it in store
and was not impressed just with
swatching it but I've never used one
Diana says NAR smudge proof with Mac
painterly on top my shadow lasted 15
hours no creasing best combo ever thank
you so much for that all right yes
Felicia does not live that close from
Felicia does not leave that far from us
tabatha I'm in say hi to Felicia Felicia
is always here I love that she comes on
periscope a lot - she's on my face okay
so let's move on let's go into cheek
products now when choosing a cheap
product for your natural look my
recommendation is when you are out in
the summer specifically take a picture
of yourself when you are stupid hot like
if it gets really really hot and your
cheeks turn red take a picture of
yourself that's the color blush you want
to get for your natural look it's
different for every single person if you
are in wintertime watching this when you
come in from the cold if your cheeks are
pink when you come in from the cold
that's what you're going to look at at
least that's what I feel I don't know
about look if you have a really deep
skin tone I don't have any experience
with that like how the skin tone changes
on someone that's very deep but you know
whether that works for you or not I I
I know it works your knee that's all I
can say so the colors that I choose that
are close to that color of my natural
flush our strengths like this and I feel
like people in my skintone get scared to
use shape like this because oh it's so
dark it's so deep it's not gonna look
good on me but oh my goodness I
absolutely love this this is Becca's
Sweet Pea it is beautiful
it's almost a bronzer with a hint of
pink you see that like it's like a pink
it looks like it's gonna be like more
Brown but it's pink and it's beautiful
oh my gosh absolutely love it also this
one from Kiko Milano this is the soft
soft touch blush let's see number one
one one I guess it doesn't have a name
this is another one that I really really
liked a lot these Molly shades look so
beautiful
on my skin tone we love them people talk
about Sabrina you've never seen Sabrina
YouTube channel she's beautiful and
amazing and smart and fabulous and love
her okay this is one that's a little bit
brighter but if you're good if I'm gonna
go pink I like these kinds of shades
this is xoxo by makeup geek this is a
cream blush no it's not thought it's a
cream blush it's not wait that's right
never mind that is not natural only what
I was thinking
I grabbed it now I was like oh yeah and
then no and no veil moving on what good
off jealousy race but don't like that
didn't happen but yeah I love these
mommy shades right here those are my
face up moving on moving on to
highlighters oh wait no let's talk about
your favorite blushes first collective
brain Julie says I love my Carlos women
will blush and Bali harvest women will
blushes are fabulous I don't recommend
much from cargo but that is something I
definitely think it's fabulous lady
Lydia says cream blushes are pretty and
doing natural - yes and I really like
cream blushes in the summer time because
I feel like it really now
into my skin where I don't know why I
feel like powders are better for me for
wintertime but I know people with dry
skin would probably think the opposite
what I know but I would imagine willow
says the bronzers in the makeup
revolution sugar pot make lovely blushes
fabulous suggestion and average girl
beauty I lost it I feel like mom shades
are universally flattering I think so
too I agree but I think some people get
scared of them
AJ said is benefits Dallas Marie Mariana
says blush trio from ABH tart has okay
blushes see Johnson says and you know
I'm disenchanted with tart blushes for
the for a while I thought that I really
liked them and I think it was just
YouTube influence that was making me
like them I don't know man like I I
really don't think they're fabulous and
why am I the only one that doesn't miss
not seeing white art brushes are so
hyped up as being the most amazing
blushes ever I really feel like part of
the reason why I was saying I liked them
was because everybody else did and I
thought that maybe I was crazy but I
didn't love them I think it depends on
the shade too I think some shape lasts
longer than others because I definitely
liked some of my top blush is better
than other ones but I feel like there's
better brushes out there than the
apartments and they're so thick and
expensive I do like the love flush
blushes by by Too Faced I have a couple
of samples of those they don't have
either full-size but I have a couple of
the small ones and I do like those as
well as far as formula Sarah says she
agrees on the Tarte blushes benefit
Nirvana is a beautiful mall Emily says
an hourglass nude exposure from amber
jessica says NARS deep throat plush yeah
that's a good one
she's lol a you gotta lol whatever you
say deep throat you have to end them
well it just it goes with it well
Heather says she likes Jeff and asked
three dots of sunshine tart powders have
a lot of kick back yes they do well some
of them do I finally clicked Mike ones
that are older don't have as much as the
ones that are newer ones
a just says chart blushes don't last
Nancy said she'd be cluttered all of her
tart flushes I don't like you
Megan says chart friend scored this I
don't own that one Caroline says
Clinique nude pop or imagine that will
be great for hair skin tones that one
does not show up on them at all gray dev
says I like the college but it's so hard
to pick up using the blush brushes I
have maybe the tart which ones are you
talking about hon Holly says Milani
Luminoso that is a classic and NARS
orgasm another classic Julie says hi hi
Julie alright let's go into highlighters
now that Julie's here we think we can
move on because we can't move on without
Julie right so I've got some powder
highlighters and I've got some cream
highlighters of course the hourglass is
going what we're going for for the
highlighters this time is more natural
highlight as well looking for from space
highlighters we did from space last time
so the ones that kind of melt into your
skin and give you just a little bit of
glow hourglass even though the price
point is insane I definitely feel like
these will give you that glow without
accentuating pores without accentuating
any fine lines and give you that nice
little brown boots are fantastic I think
that this pilot is definitely worth the
price if you are willing to invest it in
it I definitely think it's worth the
price but the thing about highlighters
though is that I feel like highlighters
is one of those things especially
natural highlighters that we notice when
we put it on our faces but I'm not sure
that that many other people notice or at
least consciously notice when we're
wearing a subtle highlight so in this
absolutely necessary no makeup routine
no I don't think it's absolutely
necessary but if you want to do that for
yourself because it makes you feel
beautiful I definitely recommend this
one it is wonderful another one that I
don't I'm not sure if this is still on
sale at Ulta or not because I know they
were getting rid of it at Ulta it's the
the Fiona styles like illusion prism
palette this is wonderful if you can get
your hands on it it is fabulous
packaging is great if it's super solid
packaging this was sent to me for review
I think it's a sponsored video perfume
smells well and go but this video is not
sponsored by anybody I don't have any
obligation to talk about these ever
again but I do really like this one this
is also very nice for a nice natural
but I'm not sure if it's still at Ulta
or not actually let me look real quick
because now I need to know I need to
know and only take me a second
alta calm Fiona
yep let's see if the highlight palette
still there you have a bunch of lip
products I don't see the highlight
palette pilot call it might be gone you
click on face just to make sure
yeah the highlight pilots gone it's not
there anyone oh it's such a bummer okay
well if you can find this it is really
really good I said on my own another
powder one the essence pure nude
highlighter this is another more subtle
one see how it's just got that shift
that's shine there it's very nice it's
just got a little bit of a shine it's
not from space I'm feeling like there's
a lot all the essence pure nude ones are
fabulous this one is up he might
highlight number ten by the way Timmy
says Fiona style says she was trying to
find a new place to sell herself I think
alters clearing ombre collection but
yeah I think so too
I'm with you Rose said it could still be
in store that's very true what was it
ever sold in store though I don't know
excuse me I don't know if it happy on a
thousand store did they under they
didn't have it in my store at least that
I saw them I don't I think the onus
tiles is still existing but I don't
think that it um it's gonna it's not it
also online any well that their song
anymore latina says so off-topic but
today is fully on my anniversary uh have
the inner bursary - latina Julio I love
you both very much happy anniversary I
hope you have a wonderful day uh
actually you know what
today's my anniversary - I think we can
get the date July 16th this is obvious

anniversary I kind of stupid am i I got
my princess my wedding anniversary right
I think you do how dumb am i this is
this time not really I am
someone thorium okay back to
highlighters thank you so much and happy
Anniversary to you too Willie I would
see them but you guys don't care about
that stuff anyway let's move on to
dandelion do by benefit
thank you everybody everybody happy
anniversary I didn't say it to my
husband either well I can't say it to me
I'm taking em I think we votes for God
you know and you this is what is this 12
13 years something like that moving on
to other five these are benefits the
only way I would recommend news is
because it is these are very very
natural they're very they're definitely
not poppy at all this is dandelion view
and this is shaggin shaggin is really
natural oh my gosh you're feeling such
an idiot it's so funny because Chad is
Liza there's nothing you can do about it
if I was ever then I would edit that
play out but I can't because it's like
so ok and then this is the that's the
idea it's really for brightening because
it's not and then this one is easy
anyway and ooh it's got a pink so oh
wait this is this is a bluff but still
it's not a good thing flush to it
I sure said that would be big the blush
but these are very very nice they are
very expensive though and I'm not
they're worth the price but if you like
those colors then I recommend this
lasting how long there's a break for me
alright yeah
okay any other highlighters we've talked
about highlighters with the collective
brain anybody else have any suggestions
for highlighters Tina says Lord Geller
French vanilla
I love Lord dollar products Tiffany says
we're all over Glo I love the glam glow
glow starter illuminated moisturizer
nice I've never tried that Julie I think
that it's like anything so let me say
John is 35 15 years yeah it's 15 years I
was 24 I got I'm okay dandelion twinkle
Lynette says and x-rayed of says I'm
scared of liquid highlighters I'm not
entirely sure when to layer them what I
do with a liquid highlighter as I do my
foundation concealer all of that and
then I'll put on the liquid highlighter
and then the powder over the sudden
power over top if you want some left low
E or even you don't have to set in
powder at all you can just do like the
finishing powder at the ends but I don't
I don't see I haven't had a personal
problem with doing setting powder and
putting it over top I know that YouTube
would tell me that's a big no-no but I
haven't had a big problem with that so I
don't know I don't know I can only tell
you my personal experience and I've no I
put setting powder on and then put the
liquid highlighter over top and have not
had a problem with it so which says
you're 39 you don't look it thank you
appreciate that I don't feel like I'm 39
in theirs I think I'm just pounded
somewhere that's always like 39 o love o
Beauty 39s month to birthday twins 1978
all right let's move on to lip products
I have a ton of lip products we've got
about 18 minutes left road system the
feeder catch he's gonna come back oh joy
says i'll genis the loominator who drops
they come in a two-piece set very nice
and natural looking fabulous Sheila says
she puts creep highlight over powder -
yeah I haven't had a problem with it I
would imagine that YouTube would tell us
we're wrong though
so oh okay let's move on to lips so of
course if you have watched my reviews
and you've been to chat a lot you know
that though the number one lip products
in my life are the bare minerals Jen use
I'm in love with them this is my genuine
collection so for this one
that's not genuine this is my bare
minerals genuine collection I did get
some of these off of the from Ipsy
points so I didn't buy every single one
of these but I bought a lot of them
because I'm in love with them
and the reason why I'm in love with the
generals is because of number one the
smell they smell like chocolate pudding
number two they I love the way that they
apply except for one shade and it's the
shade cookie that is very patchy but
other than cookie which is this one
right here if I go it's almost like a
pitch color and it's very tasty looking
almost I don't I don't like cookie at
all but other than that I really really
love these they do have their there Jen
you'd so they're supposed to be nude
shade lipsticks oh my gosh they're
fabulous this one isn't a shade balls
but they're very witty and they're soft
and very comfortable and I love them
they are not transfer proof at all
but they wear down very nicely and some
of them will stain your lips just a tad
bit so even if you do like them off you
will still see some color in there and
it just fades so gracefully they smell
so good if you don't like fragrance
you're not gonna like them though
because they do have a chocolate set
it's smell amazing I talk to people over
at Bare Minerals at generation Beauty
one one generation yesterday which one
not this past month they said that it
was supposed to be a vanilla scent and
just kind of came out chocolate so
that's fine with me but it's not
literally smells like chocolate pudding
to me I absolutely love these these are
wonderful but again not transfer proof
at all just extremely extremely
comfortable another formula that I love
that very similar is the julep formula
this is in the shape rule our law office
one's my favorite this one doesn't smell
as good but it still has a nice scent
it's got this weird little ball e out
the thing there which is kind of odd but
this one's really pretty as well it's
more of that whipped formula but it
drives down a little bit better than
this one he says Pat Bundy liquid lip in
Ludwig I don't own that one snap on he's
a little dry for me I do own a couple of
them but it's a little dry for me it's
not like they were formula just for me
personally
Adrian wants to know is there chocolate
in it no I do not believe so double
check the ingredients but I do not
believe there is any chocolate in it I
think that there is a vanilla in it
janae says oh um is my favorite and the
jug is always really
that I love that one too Rita says I
can't wear lipstick nothing loose go to
my lips why
Rita that is it we don't know rooty
rooty okay this is what she do look at
your lip color and when you go into the
store you're gonna hold up a lipstick
that looks exactly the same color as
your natural lips I know that sounds
crazy I know that sounds crazy but that
is your gateway your natural lip color
in a lipstick is your gateway drug to
lipsticks because then what you're going
to do is you're going to go a little
time exacting color just a little bit
darker and eventually you're gonna love
all the lipsticks I'm telling you that
it sounds crazy but if you want to get
into lipsticks that's the way to do it
that's how to get comfortable in my
opinion that's the way I feel anyway
Tiffany says my ultimate favorite lip is
a YX doll Ridgeville up to game number
three also look that up
Oh true name is Rita Oh see look I'm
excited so anyway everyone's mother
formulas that I really like I love the
shoe a once is your way lip creams are
super fab
who's watched this one this one is in
the shade melon which I don't think this
is a very Melanie kind of shade this is
a little Melanie but absolutely yeah aj
sides of chocolate allergy I think I
remember that about you something over
there I don't think there's chocolate
this one smells like vanilla those UA
ones and one thing that's cool about
these UA ones is that they have like an
interlocking system and see if I can get
these so well I'm not sure if the lips
lock together but there's a little
slider on the side and they have some
thoughts not sure the the lipsticks you
slide together but I know some of their
interlocking stuffs the slide together
why I thought these slid together maybe
they don't am I am I being done here
maybe it's possible but that's part of
being live is it sometimes you're just
dumb I thought that these leads together
but they don't apparently I know they do
have some products I have a quad thing
that they all the products lock together
I know why these much better but
anyway lips liquid lipstick formula is
super
I really like it they said oh I'm jus
Jenna so right haha about 30 different
nude lip colors exactly that's what she
knew laughter she do Tippy's it's an
awesome look than touch of spice because
you love it yes I just that's that's I
guess that's color color sensational I
believe maybe one color sensational
touch of spice I think that's their plan
I didn't use it in the hot minute can
you believe it it's been a while thing
that he's my second spice another
formula that I really love you can get
it all to now is the dose of colors they
had a new like a lip set that Nancy was
kind enough to get for me and oh my gosh
they're fabulous
they're so good chocolate wasted for
deep skin tones well I like this on me
too but it's not gonna look natural on
me oh my gosh I've worn this in a couple
of what's of the makeup episodes I
always get compliments when I wear
chocolate least in and then the more
natural one is called truffle this one
is super fab this is definitely one of
my favorite liquid lipstick formulas
this one is truffle on me right there so
super secret that scent is a sweet
creamy kind of sense
as far as lipsticks he make up forever
lipsticks I really like their formula
I'm starting to really get into am I
wish they weren't so expensive this is
the artist Rouge cream see two one one
oh well but that one's such a pretty
color something good right there and
it's so creamy and hydrating lasts like
a regular lipstick nothing snazzy as far
as the lasting power but they feel
really good on the lips and they go on
beautifully
I have perpetually dry lips I tell
people that all the time
my lips are always always always dry so
that when a lipstick or a liquid
lipstick looks good on my lips I'm know
that it's good I know it's good Rihanna
says are the jus a liquid lipstick
transfer proof I do not believe so my
memories tell me no try think of any of
the transfer proof one so the probably
the transfer proof ones the I would say
dose of colors is the closest I have the
ones I'm showing you to transfer to go
so College is pretty transfer transfer
resistant I would say
my problem with transfer proof liquid
lipstick is they tend to be very drying
on my lips and I don't like that
so I trade the transfer proof for the
comfort that's just me but yes the dosa
colored ones are probably the most
transfer resistant out of all the ones
I've shown you so far as far as another
solid liquid lip lacquer the lips of
another solid lipstick that I really
like the oh no this is a cheap product I
do like the the crayons like this that
are they buy juleps their lips but this
is a cheap one it's more of a dark one
this one is called passion fruit I've
got to show you this this is by a way I
know that's very dark on me but if
you're darker this is a beautiful
beautiful 1g weight um that's way julep
makes really good cheap sticks and the
lip sticks the ones that around it they
have like a moisturizing 4 in them they
are so hydrating and bad with us also
those are all the ones that I brought
out I'm usually really addicted to the
Too Faced look red lipsticks but I've
been a little less enchanted with those
no I am I the only one that's getting
disenchanted with Too Faced just in
general where I'm just kind of like you
know like I don't know when they're 20 I
think what did it for me was when they
showed the pictures of the Holiday
Collection coming up I was like you know
cuz it looks exactly the same as the one
from last year so really I guess they're
counting aren't a lot of people that are
not makeup junkies we have to remember
like I have to remember there are a lot
of people out there that don't have a
huge makeup collection and those look
appealing to them but no it just made me
sad
made me very sad and I was not happy
with the holiday collections last year I
actually had them on display downstairs
by my dad's because they're so pretty
I'm like they just sit there because
they're not functional makeup products
they don't work very well at all and
then the thing that they drama with
Jared and all of that like I don't like
to get into all the tea and everything
I'm more of a coffee girl but like jared
has not been impressing me lately but
the choices he's been making on social
media not even happy
I don't know but anyway I'm Tyler
two-faced at this point so I still like
to look friends but and I don't like
them as much as like they make up
forever one and the julep one at this
point you know I used to be obsessed so
Kari says cute packaging but that's it
yeah they are marketing masters you know
Tiffany on the strawberry collection
right that's money like that
it's money like it's genius it's like
sometimes when companies come out with
stuff I'm like yeah I should have
thought of that wouldn't like royal and
langnickel coming out with the UM me spa
brushes where anything like use the
brush to let rubbing your cleanser what
are you kidding me max I never would
have thought of that they said they've
been making spa brushes forever but I
don't know I just see this amazing so
sometimes it when I look at different
branding would be such great idea but to
me it's a great comic though I want to
do my next the truth video if you saw my
truth about five reasons why some
youtubers got big or whatever I told
that I couldn't noway I called it five
reasons why the top unit influencers are
big whatever the one that I want to do
next I want to do how brands trick you
into buying things I think that would be
a good one for the holidays though so I
might hold on to that for the holidays
there's a lot of marketing types
especially makeup companies that they
get you they get you at the top you can
do like the top five reasons why are
ways that companies trick you into
buying things oh by the way I'm done
with showing you all the product that's
why I miss daddy daddy daddy so if you
just wanted me to show you products I
don't have any more to show you but I
just spent a chat with collective rain
for the next seven minutes because it's
just fun any other recommendations you
can throw a map collective brain if
you're watching this on the roof though
you can feel free to leave your
suggestions in the comments below
because we can all learn from you then
that's why we're the collective brain
witness giant you know it's 80,000
person brain and we all can work
together collectively to find the best
stuff that's what we do
Katie says she missed it oh that's okay
I'm glad you're here so what I'm missing
a Jesus awesome video ideas still the
coffee girl yeah smell is a trick
absolutely I totally agree Too Faced
invented a lot of the tricks I think I
please I feel like that too big seems
like all packaging their substance yup
Oh new sunset palette by lorac yeah this
isn't interesting I'm waiting for the
flip to cool man I'm so down with one
like I know some people with one skin
tones we love the worm and some people
you know there's some people in general
I love the word of mind he's done I'm
too many now I'm done with it okay I
bought it off let's move on this is
anything more like the unicorn products
I'm kind of done with those too
you know I think they're all gorgeous
like I love holographic stuff like and
not holographic who's not all ha not
holographic makeup holographic makeup
designs this at least in my opinion
at least yeah mostly I don't know anyway
I can't say it doesn't exist I don't own
any holographic they go but like makeup
it shifts iridescent makeup and do it
for makeup and then love with I'm not
gonna ever gonna keep it really natural
eyebrow powders or at least good work
yeah we can talk about brow powders the
my favorite brow products are benefit
brow products are my favorites honestly
to the art video I like them better than
the Anasazi of products I feel like the
benefit ones work better for me
personally like the brow oh and the
two-faced brownie pencil I will say that
about to face I love the brownie and so
I have a review on that but the benefit
the brow is my favorite like gel brow
I really like the brow product from the
ball the ball whose brow product is
fantastic
I love that one but if you guys are the
number two if you have a brown eyeshadow
you most likely to be able to use that
brow product you necessarily need to buy
a brow powder if you don't want to if
you can find an eyeshadow that works for
you like for example I just have this on
top you Jacqueline Hill palette like I
can
like this one down here totally
absolutely you just don't you just want
to make sure that it's closer to your
hair color a lot of especially the
projected nepata it's really really warm
and my hair color is more like a neutral
a foolish kind of brown so Jacqueline
hell may not have been the best example
but you don't necessarily need a brow
powder it's really whatever you can get
to work for you try different things you
know and see what works Steve um Lee
says she likes the brow gal for me
remember which one's Brown so many
products out there and say my brain
choice unless you do it sounds familiar
but somebody things just not flipping I
do like the benefit products we all said
I want more College with were mutual
include some eyeshadow be nice to have a
nice thin mix our wing says oh the NYX
face awards oh my gosh insomniacs dream
is who I'm chasing for this one who
found me a dream I met her at generation
beauty and Tavano and she was such a
sweetheart she's so ridiculously
talented she's got a lower number of
subscribers so she's got like she needs
like the votes you know but she's always
sickeningly some sick new talented
another one that I I'm at her age every
computer on I was Spanky Valentine oh my
god her videos like Yolo you feel like
you boss Birds I was watching her videos
or you'll be insanely entertaining like
I
I watched her latest video the cyberpunk
one with my daughter Lila and we're both
like this it's fine we're like oh my
gosh what are we watching again being my
husband watch it it's like I can't even
describe it look you have to watch it
with the first eight minutes is like a
little movie it's crazy it's the
weirdest weirdest thing movie ever what
I absolutely loved it it's so weird but
if you aren't watching the NYX face
awards they really are fun you can go to
NYX face awards calm and you can see all
the videos that are people are voting on
right now they're trying to get into the
top six so this is the best time to vote
for your favorites because the top six
is like basically winning almost because
once you get to the top
to get you trip to Los Angeles and
pretty sure if anybody took the Los
Angeles you get to do the whole stage
thing you get money you get prizes you
get all that stuff and then the winner
is like the medal winner but the top six
is really super prestigious so if you're
gonna get into the mix face award this
is a great time to do it there's only 12
videos I'm usually just watch the
beginning of your video let the little
info and like what the full look looks
like and then I move on through next
we're not usually watch this tutorial
because I'm not like a huge tutorial
person but it really is a lot of fun oh
you haven't seen these channel it's yes
viii dream catcher
yeah so to vote you I signed in with my
facebook account and you can vote three
times a day for the needs face or voice
or you can sign up with your email
address or you can do both there's no
rules that you can't do Facebook and
email you can do it every year
Ireland says Victoria win to Victoria
and then is insanely talented and
insanely beautiful
I have never a couple of times and there
wasn't really a meshing of personalities
there but I'm definitely not dating in
any way but she is beautiful and very
talented even wants to know if I'm
blogging in Iceland we'll be
live-streaming from Iceland we did get a
data package like with my phone we're
gonna not use John's phone we're gonna
use my phone for everything but all the
social media screaming so it's an
unlimited data thing and for Iceland
it's just a matter of keeping my phone
charged good for you all hard part so I
just have to be really selective of when
I use my phone but yeah then we'll be
live-streaming so I'll be on my facebook
I'll be on I'll be on Facebook I've been
on snapchat a lot lately snapchat
Instagram
I'm gentles reviews everywhere I don't
know if I'm gonna be doing any of
YouTube videos from there just because
I'm not gonna doing anything makeup
related I'm bringing a bag of this of
makeup just for in case I want to do
something but I don't even for Iceland
by the way next Thursday so there's
gonna be no chat next week and chances
are there isn't gonna be a chat the
following week either but I'm not sure I
might do a chat the following me I have
to keep their eye on social media to see
yes that that beauty says that that
Spanky Valentine's video production
follies amusing yeah it's like a movie
it's literally like the movie I would
imagine because she is so friendly that
she has a lot of friends that help her
that these productions
she always has a cast of people I know
she goes on our X cos group and asked
people to be in the videos so I have a
feeling that it's her friends are
helping her because she's so insanely
friendly and funny and smart that she
probably just gets a bag of people to
support their which is totally good Liz
wants to it says Jen please blog I will
definitely be live-streaming I don't
know if I'm gonna do a favor all just
because I don't want to bring like I
don't know I might I don't know I know
there's Tommy the wrong all right I got
a Popoff here family day and apparently
it's my wedding anniversary today so I
should probably do something with my
thing Sean I don't want to know about
the just this makeup scandal I'll just
say very quickly that I I looked up and
tried to find more information on the
justice thing didn't watch the show
today at the very end there's a
highlighter that was so about justice
but they found asbestos in it
please please please if you have
children please do not buy them
children's makeup it's just not a good
idea
it's horrible quality it's not good I
would definitely recommend getting them
essence makeup I sense makeup this
cruelty free it's high-quality
but it's not like punch you in the face
like super super pigmented some of it
depending on what you choose and it's
really cute and you can get it at Ulta
do not buy makeup at justice do not buy
makeup at you know Marshalls and TJ Maxx
and stuff don't buy kids makeup because
you never this stuff is not regulated
like buy it from a legit brand it
doesn't matter what legit brand is but
please don't watch raving about it's
scary it's absolutely scary
so if you want to know more about
evenness people the article it's you
just adjust this and make up as fast as
you'll find it and it's just it's
terrifying it's absolutely terrifying
