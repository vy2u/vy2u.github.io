the make up Chet I'm running one minute
late cuz I really wanted some golfing I
hope you'll forgive me also I wanted to
make sure that I had plenty of products
out of things for us to discuss because
we're talking about drugstore today I'm
really excited about having this
conversation because I feel like between
all of us we've probably tried most of
the products in the drugstore so we can
really throw out like the best of them
and the worst things that are worth the
money things not worth the money because
some drum stores are better it returns
and others and nobody wants to take the
time out of their day you have to go
return something you know I'm saying so
we're gonna have a great conversation
all about drugstore and and all the
things that we love and things that
aren't worth it we're gonna just kind of
go through the different categories and
have a conversation so if you're joining
me not live I just wanna let you know
I'm gonna take a second and just kind of
say hi to the people that are here in
chat I just opened up the chat window so
hopefully there's actually people here
oh yeah there is lots of people here
yeah so I'm gonna go up to the top and
say hi to Michaela hi Michaela hi meri
good to see you oh and thank you she
says she loves my hair thank you Anna
Anna says she's a new subscriber Jessica
Jim ud9 recommended me yay Jessica I
have been friends since she had about
2000 subscribers she's amazing I knew
she was gonna do well and I'm very very
happy for her Jennifer hello to Jennifer
there's some she's got more of a comment
I'm gonna say hi to her and read her
comment just a second
hello to Lorraine I'm gonna go back up
to her in a second hello - is that
Jennifer again yes Jennifer again I'm
gonna read yours in a minute hello -
poppy Ciara Nicki
Amy Jean Stefanie Lauren and Texas hello
and fizzy pop hello so we're gonna go
ahead and start with Jennifer she has a
questionnaire this is Jen I'm not a pro
at makeup I do more basic natural type
looks but I can work with colors however
my question is about contouring and
highlighting crazy I'm not a fan of that
fake chiseled look but I'm challenging
myself and to try new things
do an in-depth video on it like how to
do it what items to use and what not I
would love to do that I've just I feel
like I finally gotten a handle on
contouring and highlighting like it's
taken me a lot of trial and error and
getting myself a beard and like all
kinds of stuff to figure out how to do
contouring I'm not a makeup artist I'm
just a mom and a teacher that likes to
make makeup videos so I'm not like a pro
so it's taken me a while watching a lot
of videos I went to Sephora class where
they gave me some pointers things like
that so I would love to and actually
we're gonna touch on contouring today
and we actually talked about it I
believe last week when we talked about
cheap products I did a little talking
about on how to contour but I would love
to do a video just on contouring
hopefully people would take it as you
know this is what I've personally
learned about contouring and that I'm
not a makeup artist and people probably
not picking me apart but Jen if you
would like that a Jennifer I just say
Jennifer cuz imma know if you like Jen I
would love to do that I'll put it on my
list of things that I really want to do
and we'll cross our fingers that it
actually happens alright and Jennifer
also says I've watched bigger youtubers
but they didn't help it's more like
they're putting out videos and for money
and do not help the audience well I
would like to do that and copy of course
you can participate from Greece I'm so
excited that you're here there is a chat
window over here that I'm reading from
if you're watching this later on just so
you know where this is coming from all
this reading let's see who else is here
hi crystal my weekend has been wonderful
thank you for asking hopefully yours has
been well good as well
hi says it's an San from Sweden I hope
I'm saying that right if I'm not spelled
out fanatically for me said I don't
butcher your name Sara hi I'm so happy
that you're here Sara and Amy is here
okay so let's go ahead and let's just
start talking about some foundations
let's just kind of start with like
foundations and primers and things like
that
fizzy prop says I don't think you need
to contour but contouring is fun so feel
like I can do some contouring so what
I'd love from you all that are in chat
is to start typing in some of your
favorite primers eye primers and
foundation primers not foundation well
you know one of me face primers better
from the drugstore
I can read some of those out loud for
the people that are watching this later
hello Helen okay so I've heard a rumor
that this was being I'm sure I do okay
so these are the ones that I grabbed
right away and I'll tell you which one's
my favorite I have here I have had the
regular elf eye primer yes here we go
here we go here's some good stuff so yes
mckaela mckaela if you want a good
Pinterest channel Pinterest test channel
check out Elko e ll ko she does
fantastic Pinterest things I did have a
thing called Pinterest Buster's that I
did for a while back would love to get
back into that there's just no time man
there's no time all right we're here to
learn about the elf primer
okay I'm gonna scroll up and see okay
this elf primer is not the original this
is a like a glittery one but the elf
eye primer is fantastic very easily
accessible this one is kind of weird
it's white and it's glittery and kind of
weird but it works well if you like that
kind of look underneath your eyes if you
like that glittery yes but the original
elf primer is fantastic the wet wowed
and the hard candy ones are kind of mad
I don't think that they're worth the
money personally I don't feel like
they're worth at I would say get the elf
over these these are not as good as far
as making your eyes stay on longer but
yes the eye primer from ELF is fantastic
another one that I would recommend you
can't get at a drugstore but it's
drugstore pricing is the eye primer from
Coastal Scents
it's actually pretty phenomenal I would
put this up with my high-end primers
it's really really nice let me show you
a little bit about it since you may not
have seen this before
but it is see how it's like a peachy
kind of color but then when you blend it
in it does blend into the skin so it
reminds me a lot of the Urban Decay
primer potion it really is a wonderful i
prime I've never seen anybody talk about
this I did buy this I really get
something that I didn't pay for I did
buy this with money that Coastal Scents
gave me to spend on their website after
reviewing some products for them so I
just want to let you know they but they
don't know that I bought this they don't
care that I bought it like they're not
involved in this video at all I just
really like this primer I also have
their face primer their face primer is
pretty good makes them I've been calling
it their face primer is basically just
straight up silicone like it's it's
cyclomethicone dimethicone
squats way lean there are parabens in
this so if you don't like parabens
you're not going to like this so
basically it's it's you know silicone
and parabens which probably won't be
something that most people will want and
I don't think it's phenomenal so um you
know but there I apply more really is
very very nice let me see if there's
parabens in this I know a lot of people
really care about that stuff
there's a lot of parabens and Coastal
Scents stuff yes there are parabens it's
way down on the list its third from the
bottom so I don't know if that matters
to you but there are parabens and this
as well okay um let me go up and see
some of the suggestions that you guys
have said and I'm gonna read them so
that people can benefit that are
watching this Milani yes Jean says
Milani eye primer and the NYX eyeshadow
base does like the concealer type
container not the pot those are her
favorites I've heard wonderful things
about the Milani I did have a Milani one
at one point and I lost it I don't know
what happened but I did like it while I
had it Sammy says the NYX angel primer
is good Sierra says she's never heard of
any good ones
Steph says she uses the off glitter
primer for everything actually even just
eyeshadows very nice and then Winnie
says is that Winnie Winnie win-win ring
but a text the font is kind of squishy
windy I love the eye primer from wet and
Wow and I have hooded eyes and it wears
like iron for me so that one works
really well for her that's fantastic
because it doesn't seem
be fantastic for me so depending on your
skin type different primers work
differently for each of us Nikki said
she thinks the elf primers okay but if
you unscrew the cap and there is there's
so much little product compared there's
there's less product in there compared
to what the bottle size is what she says
gene says the NYX pore filler and the
angel they all Romo fixin pro face
primer for her Nikki says the eye primer
is pretty good though and then Michelle
says hey I thought I missed the chat
this morning why are we chatting so late
because we do this the last Sunday of
the month so that people that can't come
in the mornings have an opportunity to
come chat once a month this is I think
the third one second or third one we've
actually done but I do want to do this
every month
an evening later chat let's see
hello to beauty for geeks Steph's has
the up glitter when the tubes way better
really you think so cool man and cruelty
free connect hello to you and Milani eye
primer from Yesenia she says that is the
one that she would buy and maybe Susanna
made it to a computer yay when we says
never been able to join the live chat
before I'm so I'm so glad you're here my
dear Lorraine says Michele last Sunday
of the month is an evening shot thank
you for clarifying that Lorraine I
appreciate it hello indie kitty one and
then Amy says the Urban Decay well we're
gonna talk about drugstore right now any
but you are a hundred percent right I
absolutely love that the Urban Decay eye
primer indicating one says parabens are
in blueberries so no needs to worry
some people care about that stuff I
don't know Lauren says I've never used
primers because I'm afraid it's going to
make me break out I already have a
little bit of problem with breakouts so
anybody that wants to address Lauren at
Lauren and her last name is a BER ITA if
you want to address primer and breakouts
and your experiences fizzy pop says she
likes the five o'clock chat better
Fergie wet-and-wild from Indy kitty one
Isabel lots of love from Sweden laughs
beloved to Sweden
cruelty-free Canucks s to face yes
with you we're gonna try to stick to
drugstore though just because of the
theme of the chat but I definitely agree
with you my dear Jean says Milani and
the Knicks Nicole says hi everyone yeah
I'm so glad that you're here Nicole ran
a 5k today good job Nicole she's amazing
yay Molly I have really oily lids and I
swear by the Fergie Wet Ones for my eyes
good stuff see that's the stuff we need
to know as a collective brain of makeup
awesomeness we need to know these things
so thank you so much Molly for that all
right so now that we talked about
framers because we're going to if we got
to keep moving because there's lots of
topics to talk about let's talk about
conceal concealer foundation let's do
foundation first
let's talk about foundations and
favorite foundations at the drugstore
I'm a huge BB CC cream drugstore person
like I'm alone maybe and CC creams are
banned from the drugstore I believe that
this one is no longer available except
for like on Amazon the pause baby cream
was fantastic also the Lumia cream I do
believe that this is still available
this one is a little bit more full
coverage when you're talking about BB
versus CC cream BB cream is a beauty
balm it's more of a light coverage
formula typically where a CC cream has
color correcting so you're gonna get
more coverage with a CC cream but they
both have like SPF and stuff like that I
did not like was the covergirl BB cream
smoothers I did not like this formula it
was very very light it felt a little
oily I just didn't like the formula at
all on so while I'm talking about this
you all I need you all to type in your
favorite drugstore foundations and BB
creams alright this actually these are
the NYX mineral stick foundations I got
these from my friend Lea she when she
went not last year but the year before -
I'm at she came over my house and just
dropped off a ton of stuff she's
dark-skinned so she gave me all of her
light-skinned stuff this is this is
actually a really really nice
foundation if you don't mind the stick
formula and then blending it in it is
kind of a medium coverage you can build
it up to a more full coverage but I
don't know if I recommend it for a full
coverage but you'll probably look like
cake face but but I really do enjoy
using these they're very very nice okay
here's another good one this one this
one
these are definitely must talk about
must talk about right here these two
these are the last two that I'm going to
talk about from my collection these are
ones that I personally absolutely love
please keep in mind I have normal skin I
don't have breakout issues I don't have
redness issues I'm not wearing any
foundation right now so kind of get you
an idea of where my skin is so I am not
the best person to talk about skincare
items and you know things breaking out
it just doesn't happen to me so that get
poses a problem for me as a reviewer and
then I can't talk to the majority of
people in the on the planet because the
more majority of people on the planet
have some kind of skin you know dryness
or oiliness or something like that so it
makes it hard for me so that's why I
need you guys to help me with that but
these are things that work for me these
two right here are both amazing products
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
this is the normal to oily skin one I
really love this this is probably my
favorite drugstore foundation of all
time I used to be a big Revlon Colorstay
person not the whip to the regular I
never tried the whipped but I really
liked that one a lot but I switched over
to this one I like this one much better
the original Maybelline fit I did not
like I for the it broke down on me very
quickly
it just didn't the lasting power was not
good and they didn't like the way it
were through the day so that one was not
for me but this one is my favorite now
it is kind of a medium ish coverage I
use this for filming sometimes I try not
to use a more full coverage foundation
for my day to day and then the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte this is another
really really good one this one isn't
quite my skin tone so I don't use this
one as much but it still is a phenomenal
formula I've heard more positive things
from people about this one than this one
I've heard if you have dry skin that
this is terrible that there is a dry
skin version of this I forget exactly
what it's called
but there's one that says normal to dry
skin that would be the one you would
want from this brand if you wanted to
try this if you were dry skin but I've
heard a lot of good things from people
about the L'Oreal more so than the
Maybelline so I'm gonna take a second
now that I've said my things and I'm
gonna go ahead and scroll down and see
what you all are saying about your
favorite foundations some people are
still talking about primer so I'm gonna
not neglect them and read those Helen
says so many private errs are so drying
if you have dry skin and my eyelids are
very sensitive I had to go to the
dermatologist to get cream for irritated
legs oh that does not sound like fun
Sarah says I'm loving evening ones
because it's it's 6:30 where I am and I
need to go to church thanks yeah oh good
I'm so glad that you're able to join
right now
Yesenia says the face primer from Rimmel
zero 2 is a staple for her plus the Nano
blur is great for blur very good Kristin
says eek and they're gonna see yay
Pandora says I heard the same about the
Fergie one what that it was good so
that's awesome
I haven't had good luck with it I don't
know maybe I'm in the minority on that
one so most people are saying when while
Fergie one is very good so I guess I'm
in the minority which which is fine
totally fine man hey hello Maggie it's
good to see you
gene says Maybelline blur and smooth is
good as an alternative to the makeup
forever very cool Jean thank you so much
for that nd kitty one says listening so
I can get my essay on the burden of
proof done good luck with that burden of
proof oh such a burden to make sure you
have proof isn't it you just love that
term the burden of proof like it's such
a burden you know all right
pausing for some coffee I got my phone
just chilling back here it's like you
guys were just hanging out I'm just
hanging out a food make up you know um
let's see Susanna says she loves the elf
one so hopefully we'll be getting into
some comments about foundation just a
minute jus says I just want to say I
love this later Chad it's hard to catch
it on the west coast so glad that you're
here
Erin a Nicole says she got the elf
contour palette and it's very nice
that's one of my favorites I definitely
want to talk about that today
Sarah's good cruelty food critic is
saying sorry I'm not sure why I think
your
amazing and Leslie says hello didn't
think I was gonna make it so glad you're
here Leslie Sierra says anyone have good
ones for oily skin my face is always
getting really through the day so
definitely do you have any suggestions
for oily skin Ciara Sager or Sager s IE
r ra sa ger is her name so you can at
her if you want to tell her some
suggestions for oily skin cruelty free
Canucks on my basis not or just primers
is what she's looking for let me say let
me see if I can get down to some
foundation stuff that's susana Susana
got no parks and I hope she doesn't mind
me telling you this but I'm she was hit
by a car a few days ago and she hurt her
knee so I'm hoping that she's okay as
well Annie says hopefully she's okay
with me telling you that we were talking
about that on periscope Annie hi Annie
hello everyone maybelline pore eraser
haven't tried and drugstore eye primer
but I've heard wet and wild is good
let's see gene says Maybelline better
skin or a matte and poreless is her
favorite fizzy pop says covergirl Ready
Set gorgeous
Molly's talking to Sierra she says the
Maybelline blur and smooth is nice for
oily skin thank you so much for that
Molly I haven't tried the Ready Set
gorgeous fizzy pop I'm curious to see if
there's other people that have had that
same wonderful experience Steph says
Maybelline fit me poor lists because I'm
so pale everything is too dark and
orange e on her Sarah loves the Sonia
Kashuk Pandora's favorite drugstores the
Revlon Colorstay mousse whipped I really
need to try that anna says she likes the
BB from Garnier did I not pull that out
totally didn't I heard that's being
discontinued as well oh my goodness but
yeah I love that one too I'm totally
with you on that one let's see Susanna
says she likes the Revlon for normal to
dry skin Helen says L'Oreal has good
foundations and concealers Sammy says
Physicians Formula CC is awesome Coco
Chanel says I have a duck Coco Chanel I
have ponds too I absolutely love it says
they don't make it anymore I'm totally
with you
Lucia says elmo's I'm assuming you're me
now may now my smart shade is good for
you I didn't have good luck with that
one um I don't know what happened with
that it didn't
didn't have enough oomph enough pizzazz
for me but it's I'm glad that we are
saying that there's two different ways
because you know everyone has different
opinions putting on their skin and
everything nikki says BB and CC creams
are so happy for me I don't like them
even BB creams Nikki really I'm
surprised gene says L'Oreal True Match
when we says ugh of such Oly skin seems
like nothing works for shine i use
maybelline fit me matte but still get
shine uh-uh
alright there's a lot going on and where
I want to keep going so I'm gonna just
stop with reading the comments because I
want to keep getting all of the
different areas so we're gonna go in
stop talking about foundations at this
point and we're gonna start I know I
feel like I'm pushing you guys through I
want to get two eyeshadows let's go into
face powders icon let's see a couple of
that's walking about favorite face
powders my friends alright there we go
here we go here we go we'll do face
powders and then we'll do concealers
because I said I was gonna do face
powders alright I have four here okay my
favourites of these are the Milani this
one is definitely my favorite drugstore
counter also the Rimmel stay matte I
haven't repurchased that in a while but
that one is phenomenal the Rimmel stay
matte a lot the Milani face powder and
the multitasking face powder this one is
in medium this is a phenomenal face
powder from the drugstore I highly
recommend this one again normal skin so
keep enema mine when I'm recommending
the NYX blotting powder
it's mattifying I really like this one a
lot as well these are once I don't like
quite as much this is the regular
covergirl this one john actually bought
when he was doing
make up stuff and trying to
experimenting with makeup this is in
translucent light I use this a few times
it was fine but nothing stands out I
like the other two better another one
that I didn't care for was the wet and
wild cover all pressed powder in
light/medium didn't care for that at all
and did not care for the net Revlon
nearly naked this was like not nearly
naked it was like naked like nothing
there was nothing happening with this
this was definitely not my favorite I
don't know why it still exists it
probably still exists because I haven't
decluttered this and I haven't really
talked much about it and I like to
inform you guys that things I don't like
just as much as things that I do like so
those aren't some of my powder
suggestions and not suggestions I'm
going to just skim through the rest of
the foundation and see if there's
anything else Lee Ann's here hi Liam
Sierra says Maybelline fit me and cover
girl outlast or her favorite foundations
let's see
Gina Gina's here yeah hi Gina
glad you're here Pandora says the Rimmel
Matt is super good for oily dry oily
skin so that's good to know
Sammi is talking about the covergirl
it's cruelty free really oh she's going
cruelty free she said she loves the
curly cover girl but she's going cruelty
free so she needs a new Holy Grail
Jean says she's super dry but she
doesn't like the luminous look so she
has to use regular use regular with
matte foundations Steph says she loves
her alum a smart shade - okay I guess
I'm in the minority for that one -
alright Emily the matte BB cream from
Rimmel is horrible yes it is
totally agree totally agree not matte
and hella orange totally agree totally
agree I don't know why ponds stopped
making the BB cream
alright I'm I feel bad I'm gonna skip
down because I want to I want to hear
what you guys are saying I see a sorry
Ipsy from Sarah oh no I don't know what
Elvan is get down okay I have to get
down to where we're talking about
powders so we can keep going

anti-aging serum they say it's amazing I
just ordered it from Target and you can
use code boots boots peopie to get $2
off that's good to know
I have one product from boots right here
yes really what was I thinking
like what hello I don't know if you guys
can see the color difference let me
switch over can you guys see how
different that is from my actual skin
tone like I don't know what I was
thinking it was sitting there like
looking like this and I bought it
thinking it was my skin tone like what I
guess it's not that far off but it's
dark like it's dark it doesn't look that
far off but when I put it on my face
it's way too dark but I really love it
and it smells like it smells good so I
use this in the summertime it looks it's
so funny it looks like it actually
blends in it's extremely cool tone this
is in the shade cool beige full Bayesian
very cool tone now I've got foundation
on my skin well I was like thank you but
that's the only boots product that I own
but definitely keep me in Kimia informed
about that back about how that works for
you and if it's good please miss Beth
ok I'm gonna switch back over okay I
want to see what about the powders which
you guys said about powders um Helen
says it takes her forever to get through
face powder so she's no help she uses
them only in her t-zone everyone's
saying Rimmel stay matte the fit me
powder and Rimmel stay matte for sure
let's see me I'm just gonna scroll down
from there I'm sorry if I missed your
comment Maggie says they just picked up
the NYX HD powder only tried it once so
far what do you think so far Maggie
Michaela says I love the wet and wild
color icon though it's a bronzer it's
light enough for face powder okay I
haven't tried that one I won't the only
what lot I've ever tried is this one
this is the color icon no this is no
wait yeah this is a coverall pressed
powder and
but that's good to know we're almost a
matte and translucent is pink obsessions
favorite elf HD powder a Steph's
favorite let's see yeah Nicole says I
like from yay or nay Nicole says I like
Sonia Kashuk loose powder but it's
almost the price of department store hmm
everybody's saying Rimmel stay matte
Rimmel stay matte I mean it really is a
fantastic powder and it's so cheap it's
like 2 or 3 bucks Nicky says for
drugstore I can use any face powders
they all work pretty good I love the elf
HD for under eye setting powders never
tried that one that's good to know
Helen just as much from you guys as you
learned from me I swear I probably
learned more from you guys fizzy pop not
exactly drugstore but affordable the
Avon loose translucent powder that's
good to know everyone's saying Rimmel
stay matte Sierra I used I used the pro
matte from Rimmel and still shine any
better ones Oh nicole says Rimmel stay
matte but the ones from Catrice are very
good cut trees can I say that right
Katrice are very good and very cheap
that's good to know thank you so much
for that Nicole let's see how we look it
on time we got one more minute for
powders all right Whitney says I like HD
powders a lot I know they can have
flashback but I feel like they really
absorb and prevent my oils and a lot and
also make my skin look younger than it
is when Reese says I really love this
one by elf it's a high definition one it
looks really tan but it's not it's in
the black bulky packaging so it's
inconvenient to carry around lol
Gina says favorite face powder right now
is it cosmetics celebration foundation
and lol opposite of the wheel wet and
wild face powder no judgments here haha
awesome
alright Suzanna says not sure if I buy
pores is considered drugstore not really
but you know it's okay we could still
mention it window rules really Leanne
says the NYX banana yellow powder is so
good that is so good to know beauty for
geek says mine used to be mine used to
be Revlon I wonder what it is now okay a
couple more Lauren says what HD powder
what our HD powders for exactly lol
stupid questions girlfriend I just
thought it was a gimmick to be
completely honest when I saw HD I'm like
man they're just throwing a word in
there just
if you want to buy it you know it's like
you know when people start throwing
fruit and things just because of who
that sounds like it tastes delicious so
maybe I would like it on my face you
know I was just a gimmick but I guess
maybe there is a thing behind HD I
personally don't know honestly let's see
if anybody knows in the cotton EOS chat
I bet you somebody knows what the what
the real thing is behind HD you know and
I think of banana powders I always think
of deep skin like that those are
specifically for liking deep skin for
like warm skin tones I don't know why I
always thought that I don't know if
that's true or not but that's what's in
my brain Stef says on the Cote airspun
used sparingly is good alright it's 5:30
so we're moving on to the next topic
concealers and we're gonna your
concealers pretty quickly because I want
to make sure we get to the good stuff
this stuff I think is good which is
blush and eyeshadows mascara things like
that and we only got 30 minutes left so
favorite concealer is the instant age
rewind eraser for dark circles love this
this is by Maybelline this is fantastic
also the NYX dark circle concealer this
is quite oily though I do want to warn
you this is quite lately so if you have
a little skin you probably will not like
this if you have problems with creasing
on your eyes you probably will not like
this but if you have dry skin this maybe
want to try normal to dry skin this may
be one to try I really like it a lot I
think it's fantastic and this is the
other one that I really love and you
have anything special you want to say
about concealers feel free to put that
in the comments now but I'm just gonna
go ahead and move on because I want to
keep going I want to talk about plushes
eyeshadows and highlighters and there's
so much to talk about oh my gosh I'm so
overwhelmed especially mascara I have to
get to mascara so oh and lip products oh
my goodness we're never going to get to
it okay so let's talk about feeling the
pressure to blush well you know what we
talked about blush last week we talked
about drugs for blushes last week's
let's skip blush and let's go into a
shadow okay so I got a look at this this
is a problem this is a problem I mean
this is a serious issue like what is
this I do have a YouTube
all that I do the stuff were but still
still alright I have a whole video on
these elf we're going to die shadow so
feel free to type anything you want
about drugstore eyeshadows okay this
here these elf palettes are actually
pretty nice I have a whole video on them
they're pretty wonderful my favorite one
is the needed nude I compare it to my
high-end shadows these perform just as
good as the high-end shadows but except
for the hidden ooh they all seem to wear
down pretty quickly so you can't really
carry these from day and tonight Electra
through school day through workday but
you know here they really performed very
very well I was shocked at how much I
love these but I have a whole video
longing I also have a whole video on the
we're gonna go on the L'Oreal the
palette nude one and new too I
decluttered new too
it's not for me it's feel like it's more
for deeper skin tones but I do like the
nude one it is very nice it's not like I
don't compare it to high-end shadows at
all but it is nice for a drugstore
palette if you're looking for a nice
drugstore palette this one's good and
but the elf ones you can't get in the
stores so if you want to if you want to
get one that's actually in the stores I
would recommend this one out of all of
them but it doesn't it's not as easy to
use as the elf ones but it's good it's
definitely good another one that I
really like I feel like the NYX pallets
are kind of hitting this I feel like the
smaller next palettes are not very good
most of the time but I actually really
liked this one a lot this is the go-to
palette the go-to palette lip palette
indispensable I guess this is says
wanderlust as the shades this actually
is a really nice palette if you can find
this I really like this a lot and you've
got your nice shades here you got a
bronzer blush and a highlight there
they're all very nice let me just watch
the highlight for you it's very pretty I
can do it quickly love love love that
love love love that and then the next
Alvin help I've only used this twice and
I liked it both times that I use it so
these are recommends but I don't really
like the ones like the love in Paris and
love and Rio those are not good in my
opinion
I did not like the way that they
performed I decluttered them so they're
gone out of my collection another one
that I don't recommend is the Jesse's
girl backstage collection I got this off
of FC when they had one of those deals I
got some eyeliners and I got this this
is does not perform very well there's
maybe two or three shadows in here that
are good out of a whole palette I don't
recommend that one either I do have a
video on the lapel it's and the hard
candy ones there's a whole drugstore
palette a video that you can find on my
channel if you want more information
about those so more recommends are from
Coastal Scents the hot pots that build
your own palette hot pots UV really like
these a lot
I built this palette and I'm so happy
that I did I love this palette it just
has a bunch of hot pots and that this
was one that they sent me I'm in
addition to some other stuff that they
sent me for review and I've used these
some here and there but I really love
Coastal Scents hot pots another company
that's kind of inconsistent is BH
Cosmetics BH Cosmetics palette overall I
do not like I feel like they're powdery
I feel like they don't perform well but
this one is the exception to me
this is the galaxy chic palette I talk
about this all the time really love this
I'm turning upside down so that you
don't see the mirror reflecting but it's
a really nice bright color palette it's
inexpensive it's on sale all the time so
on HauteLook even on the BH Cosmetics
website it's on sale a lot and it's
really fun to play with for bright
colors also touching into a more Coastal
Scents the revealed palettes I do have
all three if I were to recommend any of
these three I would recommend the
original revealed I feel like it's the
most consistently good out of the three
it's got some really nice cool tones
shades if you like cool tones the
revealed 2 is more pinks pinks and
burgandy's and things this one is I
would say 80% of the palette it is good
and awesome the revealed 3 I would say
about 70% of the palette is good and
awesome this is the hardest palette I've
ever had to work with I mean the colors
are all over the place there's weird I
mean just weird combinations of shades
like I don't know I just was not
impressed with this palette at all after
this review of this coastal said stop
sending me things I mean I'm gonna be
honest I'm just I liked her other
products I don't like
one but you say what do you want me to
do what do you want me to do so yeah so
this was my least favorite I still loved
coastal stunts though I still order
stuff from them on with that another
thing I want to talk to you about was
the wet and wild palettes these things
are amazing they're so awesome they're
so fabulous I know you guys are putting
all kinds of really great comments and I
feel like I'm talking too much but I
want to talk just a little bit more
about some single eyeshadows we always
want to talk about the with some okay
Milani Bella's shadows are fabulous
you're going natural and organic the
Pacifica eyeshadows are fabulous these
are single shadows are amazing I got a
Pacific eyeshadow what's that I could
not stand and then ever since then I've
liked every single Pacific at eyeshadow
I've ever gotten oh my gosh
amazing amazing amazing another thing
too is very good as the L'Oreal
infallible
these are awesome this one is in who
amber rush I love max color pop
eyeshadows are hit and miss for me I
don't like the ones that have glitter in
them by the end of the day I've got
glitter on my cheeks I do not like that
look so I don't like the glittery ones
but I do enjoy them that ones don't feel
like they're is easy to work with
because of the cream formula makes a
little more tricky to work with I mean
they can be worked with but they're not
my favorite to be honest the color
tattoos are very hit and miss for me the
only one that I would say we actually
recommend from the cold color tattoo
line of things that I've tried is the
one and bad to the bronze this is by far
my favorite it is a wonderful wonderful
shade and I would recommend this one but
other than that I really I haven't
thoroughly enjoyed any other color
tattoos pick this one all right another
one that I wanted to mention here is the
Maybelline eye studio as these are
actually pretty good if you can find
color ranges that you like but they're
kind of pricey so I don't know if it's
worth of Christ
did I mention this the comfort zone by
wet-and-wild big huge thumbs up on that
one and I'm gonna take a second to
scroll down and see if there's any
comments because we're 20 minutes from
the end and I didn't even get into
mascaras or
and I really want to get into that let
me see okay
I'm gonna scroll up Pacifica eyeshadows
you can get those at Target they sell
them at Target Jean let me say see if I
can go up a little bit um let's see okay
I'm gonna start here a pink obsession
says Coastal Scents BH Cosmetics um and
more if he's single pots are great I
just hadn't did an order from morphe so
I'm very excited to get that in the mail
from were fee I got one of the build
room palettes and then I got one of
their pre-built palettes because I want
to use them for comparison for Coastal
Scents and BH Cosmetics San says oh
there are so many brands we can't get
here and so we didn't have to go to the
US again and show up some I would love
to know what brands you have in Sweden
and what brands are good for you I would
really love to know more about
international makeup you send me an
email at Jen Lowe's reviews at gmail.com
I would really love if you live in
another country and you have brand that
we can't get here in the u.s. that you
love please let me know because I wanna
I want to build my knowledge about
makeup just all over the world so when
recess loves the galaxy palette just got
last month that's so pretty
Annie says she doesn't have any
drugstore eyeshadows Nicki says makeup
each sold online and makeup makeup pink
eye shadows I got some on her very first
release of eyeshadows and I really
enjoyed those those are actually I put
them in this giant this giant palette
here these up here are my makeup each
eyes those are all the ones that I own I
never got any more after the initial
release you make sure these are Coastal
Scents down here I'm pretty sure they
are let me see
no this is this is makeup geek I guess
these are all makeup geek these must be
all makeup geek except for I think this
one other than that these are all makeup
geek this one is actually really cool I
love this one this is in Razzleberry oh
my gosh this is an amazing shadow and
it's got this it's this red with this
gold glitter oh my gosh is so fun so fun
so fun I haven't used it in a while I
need to use that at some point because
it's totally fun
but yeah makeup geek shadows are amazing
at least the ones that I got when she
first released them I really like stay
hmm let's see
I mean recess she hated the revealed
three so bad I'm not the biggest fan of
it either
let's see nicole says she just ordered
the makeup geek blush palette it was
half off yes
oh it's laughing the Coastal Scents got
me off I don't know if it was because of
you they just never sent me anything
anymore after that
see fizzy pop says her friend from
England sent her a bunch of MUA products
and she loved them Steph says that
Nick's prismatic sar good I don't know I
don't know if they really stopped
sending it to me because of that that's
what I'm assuming because that was when
it stopped and every other review that
they sent that palette to was on their
website mine was not Sammy says anyone
trying makeup revolution I have not
tried that yet I should though that Katy
Beauty says her daughter loves wet and
wild but she's allergic cruelty-free
Connect says she wants Pacifica but it's
three times the price there uh Tina says
I haven't opened my revealed three
either
let's see Nicole says you need to try
the zoeva palettes the best ones for
like $20 I don't know that brands that's
awesome
Jin says the light Pacific eyeshadows
aren't as good as their darker colors
that's good to know
alright so we have to actually move on
because it's 542 and I want to get into
especially mascaras because that's
really important to me to get is that I
do want to mention a few pencil products
before
move on let's do well a few like liner
products one that I really want to
highlight is the next wonder pencil I
really love this product it's really
really nice it's great for covering up
blemishes what are dark spots it's very
good for breaking off the under eye I've
used this for a lip liner like when my
lipsticks going out of control like
lining the outside my lips and kind of
blending it in we did this on periscope
one day I was on periscope and I used
the dark color not before this week's
what's up and makeup before the week
before and I was like man I shouldn't
use the lip line and everybody's like oh
and I was like I have that I broke it
out and it worked great for like a lip
liner just kind of get rid of any
mistakes from my lipstick that I had
done I don't liquid lipstick from
colour-pop and it all went bad so this
really saved me so highly recommend that
on the Jessie's Girl eyeliners these are
my favorite liquid eyeliners of all the
liquid eyeliners to try I like them
better than the Kat Von D tattoo liner
in trooper I like it better than the
Stila liquid liner
these are amazing this is the blue and
the brown these are the new ones I also
have the black the black was the
original one that I got and I absolutely
love it this show this shirts from from
Express I got right before I went to New
York someone had asked about that
supposedly cruelty free Canucks says the
essence lip pencil is amazing
lovely using the white NYX pencil as a
shadow base yes the white and pencil in
milk is fantastic for I show these
totally agree totally agree I also want
to give note to these were given to me
by Jake a beauty for review but again
they don't know I'm making this video
they don't know like they're not
involved in this at all
the hashtag MOTD eyeliners just be
prepared with a sharpener because a lot
of times the tips will break off you're
on your first use so you just have to
sharpen them off but they're really
fantastic eyeliners this one let me just
show you they're just really opaque this
is a matte green and it's called
tropical green and then this one is the
white one this is called pure white and
then this one is called I just randomly
grab three they sent me a ton of them
this one is called sunrise blue
but they say very nicely in the
waterline they're very easy to use and I
really like this formula a lot but yes
Jessie's Girl is sold at Rite Aid some
people are talking about that but I've
never found that eyeliners there I think
you have to order them off of Jessie
squirrel calm if you're looking for a
drugstore eyeliner that you really
really like that drugstore eyeliner that
you really really like like that makes
sense the Maybelline master precise is
one that I've used and really liked but
I don't think it's as good as the
Jessie's Girl but if you want one that's
actually good from the drugstore that's
one that I would recommend it just
doesn't last that long staff the NYX
curve is one of the one that she
recommends that one did not work for me
because it seeped into my fine lines it
kind of spidered out into my fine lines
so that one did not work for me but if
you don't have fine lines the NYX perb
may work for you i Steph do you have
fine lines does that do that to you
apparently it doesn't Tiffany says her
favorite eyeliner she's used was bare
mineral lasting line that is a very nice
one Alyssa says made to Chad's going to
end in 15 minutes but I'm so glad you're
here anyway see Tiffany or gel eyeliners
from her favorite is essence yeah the
essence products I'm just starting to
really get into the essence products I
really really like them a lot so far
Marcel is a very good brand as well
cruelty free cannot absolutely all right
so we're starting to run out of time we
got 15 minutes left I have to talk about
mascara because this is one of those
things and I need to talk about lip
products at all either so hopefully
we'll be able to get into some lip
products mascara is one of those things
that I truly believe no one no one in my
opinion should buy high-end mascara
unless you just want to fancy mascara
just to say you have a fancy mascara I
feel like genuinely mascara does not
need to be bought high-end period no
exception there's no high a mascara that
I've ever tried and I've tried a lot
that I think could beat out these
mascaras I'm about to show you three and
a half first one Maybelline lash
sensational fantastic mascara starts off
a little wet but as it ages a bit
fabulous absolutely fabulous let me show
you the wands
oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my
goodness right here right here
Oh compared to the benefit roller lash
it's amazing I have a video comparing
the two and this one looks better than
the roller lash another one very famous
for being awesome two Jordana bass slash
extreme got this from a girl Victoria
Nelda have now repurchased it twice
brush brush looks absolutely boring
formula is phenom and brand new purchase
from not purchased brand new to me
through the glam the the FC swag bag
from generation Beauty the essence I
heart extreme mascara another phenomenal
mascara Wow then no like I'm not even
kidding amazing absolutely amazing
another one this is my half this is the
L'Oreal double extend don't get the blue
one though get the red one the red one
is better than this one it's got primer
on one side the primer it is good but
the the mascara on this one is not as
good so i pair the primer with another
mascara and this works great but the red
one both sides perform well Elise says
she loves the lash sensational Steph
says she doesn't don't splurge on
mascara like what's the point absolutely
absolutely and this is one I truly
wholeheartedly from the depths of my
soul believe they drugstore mascaras are
these are actually better than the
high-end mascaras that I've tried the
only exception for high-end mascara that
I would say that works just as good as
these is the Urban Decay perversion I
love this mascara it is incredible but I
don't feel like it's worth the price
difference at all so I still even though
this is phenomenal and maybe this is
much better than these it's not worth it
no one's gonna know the difference but I
promise you no one will be able to tell
like wow you must have expensive mascara
on nobody's gonna say that to you here
Rinty alright so now we've talked about
little bit Matt about mascara let's see
okay let me read some of your things
cruelty free connect says essence the
pink tube is better than the better than
sex mascara Susanna says the essence
mascara Revlon volume and Maybelline
lash sensational Stephanie says they was
made as al Mays get up I think it's get
up and grow but you're absolutely right
that's another fantastic the Almay yes
totally agree totally agree
let's see any drugstore dupe for a Lance
404 the defense'll x' mascara by Lancome
any of those let's see beauty for geeks
look at morphine about four pound okay
want let me go back up when Wow fizzy
pop says the Wet n Wild mascara in the
pink tube is good for you about this one
the max volume one I thought this one
was good I didn't think it was as good
as the other ones but it's good I
definitely think it's worth the purchase
for the price but yeah let me go up and
see some of these other mascaras L'Oreal
voluminous fiber lash mascara I've heard
wonderful things Leslie says that that's
amazing
Ciara says I should do a mascara get
away with my used mascara I'm due for
the Urban Decay perversion in a class of
its own but I don't anybody is going to
be able to tell the difference and
you're using one of these amazing
amazing this right here when these three
no ones mere no tell the difference
but Urban Decay perversion is very good
let's see elfs mineral mascara whitney
says it's three dollars sinister
favorite mascara no clump super
lengthening on her lashes she has tubes
of better than sex perversion etc very
good if you want the the SILS booster XL
by Lancome if you want to do from that
which is the lash primer I'm telling you
this is just as good that L'Oreal double
extend the primer side is just as good
especially in the red tube alright let's
talk about lips we need to talk about
lips before we go we've got ten minutes
left and I want to get into some lip
products and he says you deeper version
can take my money its formula
application ease and final results it's
BAE deaded Annie
whatever makes you happy whatever makes
you happy are a tubing mascara Helen
wants to know about a tubing mascara
what I've heard is the tubing mascara it
actually like wraps your lash
in like a to be kind of formula I don't
know man I the chart at fried tarts dry
tart tart
I lost it already says Betty Ann says
love the Maybelline mascara it's amazing
alright let's move on let's talk about
some lip products
oh and then we catch on my contour oh my
goodness alright so lip products my
favorite liquid lipsticks of all time my
favorite formula and people may disagree
with me on this is the colour-pop liquid
lipstick this is this stuff is amazing
it's absolutely amazing it's cheap it's
awesome and I love it I've heard of
inconsistencies in the formula I don't
know if I've noticed that but I
personally love them some knows for me
the e the NYX liquid suede czar knows
for me I don't enjoy those they flake
off my lips and they're drying in there
I don't like them the NYX soft matte lip
creams those those who want patchy for
me I don't like those I do like the Rev
the Rimmel show up lip Velvets these
though I thought the shade range is not
enough for more like I want more you
know more shade range more shade range
some products again the colour-pop
lippie stix are phenomenal totally
totally totally in love with those these
do not get enough love these wrap on
sticks every single formula they've ever
put out in these Revlon sticks I love I
love them I love them so much to the
depth of my soul I love these things
every formula the matte ones the regular
ones the shiny ones love them so much so
much note about the Milani lipsticks I
wanted to note this real quick these
things have a really strong smell so if
you don't like strong smells do not buy
the Milani ones but it smells like
watermelon but and also the formula can
get a bit thick as it ages it gets kind
of sticky so these are not my favorites
one product I would recommend that I
really like that I don't know where it
is right now is Rimmel's Rimmel's
airy-fairy
is one of my favorites the Rimmel
lipsticks are amazing I'm reading some
things here let's see you're saying it
says Maybelline well I'm going to
fastest : G fast and losing it Wow okay
okay Helen says some give me think of
the lipstick lip gloss may be the same
as mascara no need to go high-end you
know I hate to say it
I do I love my high-end lipsticks I
think there's a difference I do I do
think there's a difference but is it
enough difference justify the price
that's where the question is is it
enough difference like these are really
good and I love them but there's
something about putting on high-end
lipstick the just I don't know what it
is like it's like it gets into my heart
and soul and I just it's like brings me
to another plane of existence when I use
a high high-end high-end lipsticks I
don't know look I just got this
Charlotte Tilbury look because I didn't
want to mention it but I can't help it
but the formula is so good white beauty
another brand of lipstick like just the
way it feels on the lips and it really
is a feeling rather than an actual
performance because this last is just
the same as of lipsticks I was like the
Rimmel ones I would say this lasts the
same amount of time this is five times
the price it lasts same amount of time
but there's something about the way it
feels when it goes on that's like a
smoothness it gives you that luxury
feeling that I really like and I have
the same thing with the bite Beauty
lipstick same thing with what else
trying to think I have a YSL lipstick
same thing like I just there's a
smoothness to it but for the average
typical person I don't think it's worth
the price difference but for me as a
junkie I feel like sometimes every once
in a while it is worth the price
difference that's my opinion bring that
back on the floor because it doesn't
belong in this video but anyway
Nicki says the NYX liquid suede stink
totally agree with you let's see Sammy
says the hard candy chubby sticks big
surprise very nice
Kat Von D I know it's high-end I like
the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks as well
and I've heard great things about her
lipsticks cruelty free Canuck says are a
colour-pop liquid lipsticks greasy no
she loves the liquid lip and the lip
pencils if you love the lip pencils and
you'd rather do that you can take the
lip pencil and use that and put a lip
balm over top of it and you've magically
created a lippy stick if you feel like
you don't don't want to invest a little
be six don't worry about
just get the get the get the lip pencils
and put a lip balm over it you may let
be sick but no they are not Willy or
greasy if you're worried about it at all
then I would say get the matte ones the
matte ones are good and the satin ones I
think they're satin ones
Lumiere is phenomenal I really level in
the air okay it's 556 I have to go out
to dinner with my family so I can't stay
too long past six because I promised
them another vote for wet-and-wild
chubby sticks Wet n Wild mega last
lipsticks but they always smudge on me
yeah so what I've noticed about the wet
and wild okay they're cheap they look
nice on initial application but if
you've got a dark-colored girlfriend you
better watch out because it's gonna be
in lip liner or no lip liner you're
gonna have it all like you're gonna look
like what's your name what's that chicks
name on YouTube kollene I'm drinking a
sip of coffee to procrastinate Miranda
sings girlfriend you're gonna look like
Miranda sings with those wet-and-wild
lipsticks if you do not wear unless you
have like the best lip liner ever
because they just start going all over
all over not cool the ones who do not
dark though you can probably get away
with the other thing is is that they get
hard really quick like they get like
rock-hard they dry out and it's just not
a pleasant experience to use them
anymore
yes we're into sings thank you very much
but um but yes that's what I feel about
lip products since we have because this
is my baby this is my baby right here
this is the off contour palette like if
I lost this orphaning happened to this I
would cry like this this is you don't
like her Pandora says she doesn't like
Marina things I like her I think he's
funny I should character she reminds me
of its patch remember that from sorry
not laugh a long time ago like a
different version of that Marlene says
I'd not have that problem at all with
the wet and wild what kind of lips do
you have I have I don't know they're
typically dry
actually they are kind of dry and I do
have a little bit of fine lines here and
there like you can't see them in the
camera but I can see them up close but
yes oh my gosh oh my gosh if you can get
your hands on this from the elf website
oh my goodness
amazing amazing just as good as my high
