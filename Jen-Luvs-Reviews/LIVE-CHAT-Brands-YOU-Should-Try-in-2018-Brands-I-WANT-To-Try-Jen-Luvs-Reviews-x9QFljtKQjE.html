that you can see me oh my god the drama
the drama of drawing the livestream on
YouTube right now is insane but I think
I've got it figured out so I'm hoping
you are here for my the best brands of
2017 video I've got some products for
you to share from those brands it looks
like it's working I'm so excited
I've got a bunch of brands for you that
I tried in 2017 some brands I've tried
before but some standout products from
different brands that I think we should
be watching for what they're putting out
in 2018 I think that there are good
contenders for some of the brands that
look like they're on the right path I
think for 2018 and then I've got a list
of some brands that I want to try in
2018 and I'd love to get your advice on
some of the best products you've tried
from those brands so I know what I
should try now this isn't a guarantee
that I'm actually going to try these
brands because you never know things
change feelings change
okay sorry everyone so I go off on these
like 80s rants and not rants but these
like eighties little tangents of songs
and things they pop into my head but
sometimes feelings change you know and
and you got it you got to move on to
other things so but I do I do have my
eye on these brands so I would love to
get some advice from you on what some of
the products are from this so that I can
kind of have a little shoe op in the
list so yeah I'm really excited about
today's video I'm hoping the sound is
working I was up till about 1:30 last
night watching GG gorgeous as this is
everything and testing out any coding
software so um so yeah a little bit my
brain is like not quite connecting right
now so which is pretty typical of me and
one of these live chats but I don't even
remember what my point was that's how
I'm all like what is oh I want to show
you my shirt that was one thing I want
to tell you before we get started this
shirt is from the March line of that
Tayla I saw them and I fell in love with
them and I bought one and I love it it's
very very soft it is a little bit thin
so like I wear a tank top you know over
top of
my under close so that you don't see any
lines but it's really super comfortable
and you can kind of pull it over the
shoulder or whatever if you want to I'm
gonna keep it up cuz I don't well I have
a tank top on but still I don't know I'm
gonna keep it up but you can like slouch
it over the shoulder it looks super cute
but yeah but I wanted to let you know
that I got that and where this was for
Amex I knew people were gonna ask but
anyway let's go ahead and say hello to
the people in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness that are here today
I'm gonna scroll up and see who was here
first
AJ is here good morning to you to you
and your butch good morning Jess good
morning to you and your purple hearts in
Austin Texas good morning to julie and
caroline and Christina in Alberta Canada
it's 8 a.m. there well thank you so much
for being here
good morning to Becky and Tabitha good
morning to all of the moderators chat
moderators appreciate you being here
good morning to Amanda and Nancy my
friend good morning to you and Steph
who's one of our fabulous moderators
good morning stuff amber and beautiful
journey and Jana and Katie and Mimi and
Mon 4:20 and they's XO and Charlie good
morning to you and good morning to
everybody that is here I saw somebody
was in England I don't think it's the
morning there but good after I guess
it's afternoon because it's forward six
hours so it's 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 o'clock
so good afternoon to you almost good
evening let's go ahead and get started
with some of the brands that I wanted to
mention to you this brand I mentioned in
my monthly favorites and I wanted to
bring them out again this isn't any
brand called cryptic cosmetics they're
liquid lipsticks are on point they are
so nice this is I have two other ones
because they did a collaboration with a
brand called solo look that I also very
much enjoy I wish they came out with
more products though I guess so look you
know they do all these on collaborations
with different movies and things so they
did the Dirty Dancing palette and their
eye shadow quality is fantastic
but they did a collaboration with
cryptic cosmetics as well for that they
put a lip liquid lipstick in and that
was from cryptic cosmetics but these are
wonderful liquid lipsticks I love them I
love this is the desert kisses set I
think it's like 40 bucks though which I
feel like is really pricey but the
quality of these is real
good let me show you the metallic oh my
gosh so opaque and they're very
comfortable they dry down completely and
they're very comfortable which is what I
really like they're not the most
comfortable because they do dry down so
I don't think that it's really possible
to have a liquid lipstick dry down
completely
and be you know moisturizing you know
what I mean it's kind of you know the
kind of contrary but this is pretty much
as comfortable as a completely dried
down liquid lipstick can be and they're
just beautiful they're beautiful on the
lips there that really trendy metallic
look which is super trendy right now so
if you ever see these on sale like they
had a sale on these for Black Friday I
believe and they were 50% off for the
individual ones at like nine bucks
apiece it was like oh my gosh so if you
ever see this on sale
jump on them I definitely recommend them
I just wish that they were you got a
little bit more product but if you never
like I said my favorites video if you
never run through an entire liquid
lipstick it's not even gonna matter that
there are a little bit on the smaller
side but yeah definitely recommend that
liquid lipstick formula Kristina says oh
I'm not a metallic lover but that's
gorgeous I mean they're just they're
really beautiful and they're very opaque
and they really um they give such a nice
beautiful soft shine to the lips they're
not like so shiny that they look
obnoxious you know any mean like some of
those gold lips it look really beautiful
and Instagram you wear that to the
grocery store people are gonna be like
you know not everybody you know some
people if their style I'm not trying to
be judgy I'm not being judgey but you
know what I mean like a lot of people
would not find a super metallic lipstick
to be very wearable
some people do it's it's all you
girlfriend or boyfriend but these are
not that level of shine where it looks
like straight metal it just gives a
really nice shine to the lips I really
like them Shauna wants to know what
happened last night I was testing the
did you but video she said I was testing
my my new end coding software that's why
if you saw a live stream from me at
about 12:30 last night I was testing the
software and I forgot to set it to
private so it was just a black screen so
about a thousand people saw a 10-second
black screen last night with a weird
random title so I do apologize if you
got excited and you were here and I
wasn't so I do apologize for that
alright so let's move on so cryptic
Cosmetics for the
like with lipsticks definitely this is
one I've talked about so much and if
you're gonna get tired of me talking
about them because I think that I am
officially making these my favorite
eyeshadow formula of 2017 coloured raine
you're gonna hear about these again I'm
sure in my I'm gonna do at the end of
December or early January hopefully end
of December my favorites and fails
countdown for 2017 and I'm sure that
coloured raine is going to be in there
there i shadow formula is sick it's it's
on a whole nother level like it is sick
and I think I even brought these into
chat last time because but I have to
show them again this shade and flashing
lights I about died and I just bought
the new to Faced chocolate bar metallic
palette and I also bought the Tarte
finger paints palette I want to do like
a battle of the metallic eyeshadows you
know bring out Julia's place bring out
these bring out those and see which ones
really are the best so check this out
this silver oh my gosh like what what oh
they're dressed and they go it's look it
makes your eyelid look like aluminum
foil like it's insane
I didn't bring my towel over here I just
realized do I even have a towel I
usually keep like a stock oh I do yeah I
have one but yeah they're there and
they're lasting power is so good there
are definitely more for people that like
that real big punchy pop of color if you
are more of like a subtle person I've
got some recommendations for you
coloured raine maybe too intense
like I got this here this is the lovelyz
palette i'm just a huge fan of metallic
eyeshadows in general check out this red
shade look at this sick sick
I got can't even I can't even with this
let me hold it still because sometimes I
don't you know me says some Pat McGrath
level pigmentation I know right and it's
a fraction of the price of the Pat
McGrath stuff I mean like well I'm gonna
bring out when I do that video which I'm
hoping I do I say I'm gonna do this
video in that video and that doesn't end
up happening so I don't want to
guarantee anything cuz you know things
happen but like I've got one of the Pat
McGrath mothership pallets I've got
pochittona I've got you know what else
visi art I've got some some stuff to
show you you do not need glitter glue
with these you do not need anything at
least for me I don't have hooded eyes or
anything but I don't have a problem with
these transferring I don't have a
problem with them staying on the eyes
there's no actual glitter in here it's
not glittery there's no fallout it's
just straight metal rule or can't even
Michaela says Jen if you tried you waste
that skinny dip metallic palate is it
any good I have not tried it
I haven't had good luck wish away
products I know a lot of people seem to
really like them so I feel like I maybe
I'm like doing something wrong or
missing something I don't even know oh
you know what I just noticed is that the
live stream on here looks like it's the
wrong size for the screen I'm gonna have
to work on that for next week it looks
like it's a got a little black border
around it I do apologize that has to do
with my end coding software that's brand
new to me I'm gonna have to figure that
out but I do apologize that it's the
wrong size you know I'm still working
out the kinks hopefully you can still
see me in everything show the metallic
with light on it please okay I thought I
had light on it but we'll do it again
here we go I have these lights up here
let me see if I can see those there's a
30-second delay is that working
hopefully that's working I have these
lights shining on me some hoping you can
see did that work I don't know because
there's a 30-second delay let me do
another one sorry if it's taking so long
Mariana says talk about color pop
metallic shadows and lipsticks I haven't
tried them oh yeah the lights working
okay we're good I haven't tried them
Mariana so I can't speak to them I'm
sorry that's something that should
probably try though Jennifer says she
weighs lip the lips are so dry don't
understand the hype yeah I haven't
figured out you a and why everybody
talks so much about them I don't know
there we go okay so now let's move on I
could talk about them all day too dose
of colors I could not find my little my
mom's palette my mom's palette
absolutely love the eyeshadow formula
from dose of colors is on point I don't
like the little pots the ones that have
like the cream shadow
the powdered shadow I don't like those I
have a lot of trouble with where time of
them with the formula just in general
with fallout stuff like that I don't
really like those but I do love their
liquid lipsticks they're very similar to
the cryptic cosmetics but these are not
like that metallic shift that would be I
think the biggest difference between
these formulas for me between the dose
of colors and the cryptic cosmetics is
that the dose of colors are going to get
more product and also these are more of
a matte formula at least these are the
ones that I own I don't know if those of
colors has any metallic formulas or not
I didn't research that because the ones
that I have are matte the ones that I
wear the most are not these actually the
ones I wear the most are truffle truffle
is like been whoa for me this this year
I mean I've worn truffle I don't even
know how many times and chocolate wasted
if you like a really really dark brown
absolutely beautiful this is moon days
and supernatural I'll swatch moon days
for you I got this nude set and it oh my
gosh it was so such a good deal when it
was out I don't know if it still exists
but that's moon days and they're really
really nice again they do dry down and
the lasting power is beautiful they're
just really really nice and then we have
oh I talked about their eyeshadow
formula so both of those from dose of
colors the eyeshadow formula and also
the liquid lipsticks I would definitely
recommend and she says she loves the
dose of colors liquid lipsticks bar
lever stick says love dose of colors H
family says dose of colors also my 20-18
brands I need to try black diamonds and
pearls you a lip products are sold on
Forever 21's website are they really
they're also sold on Beauty lish what
did what an opposite City on forever 21
and Beauty lish like that just seems
opposite Mariana said did you like the
max noble collection I did not purchase
that you guys got to remember I love it
like I feel really bad because Marianas
asked me now two things that I haven't
tried yet there's so much makeup coming
out there's only so much that we can
purchase as reviewers it's like there's
way too much I did not get the snowball
collection I probably won't get the
Patrick Starr stuff unless there's
something that really stands out there's
just too much stuff coming out this is
what it comes down to you know
just I can't I would love to try a lot
of stuff but I don't get a ton of PR I
do get some PR I usually put my PR stuff
up on Instagram because I want to thank
the brand and I feel like the best way
to thank the brand is to share it with
my audience on Instagram and it's like
fast and easy and I can show them and I
can tag them and they can see that I am
saying thank you to them so if you're
curious what I get for PR make sure
you're following me on Instagram and
follow those live streams but I don't
get a ton of stuff like a lot of people
do Rena says never tried dose of colors
is it worth a try yes that is why I'm
mentioning it is because I do feel like
it is definitely worth a try Shawna says
for every 20 want to start and get
pricey really I haven't been there in a
while Bobbie says I love you I love you
back Bobbie I do see your comments when
you come into my videos thank you so
much for that okay let's move on to the
next one I feel like I was just very
dismissive to Bobbie I didn't mean to be
dismissive if it sounded dismissive
sometimes I watch these on the replay
and it's like I don't even know why I
said that like that it son didn't sound
very nice doll face says Jen can you
shout out shout my shout me out I love
you so much
I love you so much doll face zero 487 I
love you too okay let's talk about
essence cosmetics see again dismissive I
don't know
so essence cosmetics we've got a couple
of products that I definitely really
really love from them the last princess
mascara kind of went viral this year and
I really really love this it's a great
mascara and it's been kind of a Holy
Grail I need to buy another one you can
see this one's getting a little beat up
let me show you the wand the wand is
kind of bendy which I really like
because I feel like it really goes makes
you know kind of pushes the lashes up
very very nicely I really really like
this mascara lots of length lots of
volume I'm not a person that gets a lot
of flaking and smudging so I can't
really speak to that but I can tell you
that I haven't had any flaking and
smudging so nothing you know out of the
ordinary as far as that but just I
really love the way this makes my out my
lashes look I think it's time for me to
get another one of these and then
they're pure nude highlighters this this
one is in the shade be my highlight and
this is absolutely beautiful for a
subtle highlighter it reminds me a lot
of the
the hourglass highlighters you know the
hourglass highlighters that are like I
have the pan one it's like a three pan I
think it's like sixty bucks or something
for a three pan highlighter these
essence pure nude highlighters remind me
a lot of those because they're not those
from space highlighters they're very
wearable highlighters they're very like
office appropriate you know no one's
gonna look at you and be like woah look
or jeez you know it just gives a really
nice soft glow to the skin and also I
don't find it to accentuate my pores my
pores aren't gigantic but I don't find
it to accentuate my pores which is
really really nice
Steph says the essence mascara in the
purple tube game over I have not tried
that one as ins keeps coming out with
more and more mascaras so I haven't
tried them all but that's awesome I'm
off to check that one out Holly said
well you should get PR you give these
company so much exposure with what's up
and makeup well it mean it's up to them
if they want to send me stuff that's
cool and honestly like I get a little
overwhelmed if I get too much stuff so
I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna like
contact brands and ask them to send me
stuff because honestly it gets a little
bit overwhelming because it's like why
do I even put all this stuff you know
like even the amount that I get so you
know I don't even know how people handle
it the - those like Tati with the giant
piles of boxes and everything like how
many men what does she put all that
stuff I guess she's got a huge room but
but anyway essence is sold at Ulta and I
believe some drug stores sell essence at
this point but I know that they're sold
at Ulta and you can also get it online
but yeah I definitely recommend checking
out essence as a brand they've got some
really good stuff really good stuff ok
let's move on to NYX and next of course
is weight on I met Rosa says everyone
talks about essence I think I should
jump and start saving tons of wasted
money on pricey stuff yeah I mean
essence really and you know what before
I talk about nyx essence really is a
nice brand for people that are trying to
buy some makeup for a teenager and don't
want to spend a lot of money and also
don't want to buy makeup at Claire's
like for preteens and stuff you know
like that Claire's makeup can be like
super dangerous like they had the
asbestos thing and the Claire's makeup
was at Claire's it was just this makeup
there was asbestos and the Justus makeup
earlier this year I mean I really don't
recommend anybody buy this to make up at
just this and Claire's that stuff freaks
me out
it's very very
we made in China like there's some I
mean I tried some of it at one point
because I was curious I tried one of
their brushes it was awful the one from
Claire's and I figured I would try to
see it and it was just the performance
was awful it was atrocious so if you're
looking for makeup for like a preteen or
a teenager that they want you know
something a little bit lighter with some
cheap packaging I definitely recommend a
since I that's what I always tell
parents because it is high quality it's
cruelty free and it's less it's not very
expensive so if something happens with
it if you're not like you're out a ton
of money so so yeah I definitely
recommend that let's talk a little bit
about NYX let's move on to next this
Nick epic epic ink liner like was one of
the best finds that I found this year it
is amazing I do want to let you know
that I did receive this for PR though
I'd always want to disclose that but it
doesn't matter I mean anybody you see
reviewing this I've never seen anybody
review this with a negative review it's
thinking amazing it's got a brush tip
the only thing I don't like about it is
I don't know if you can see there's
little hairs that are sticking out if
you get it like not quite in the center
the outside hairs of the brush can fray
out I can trim them with some scissors
but I kind of like to keep them on there
so in case anytime I mention this to
anybody I want to be able to show you
those little hairs so that you can know
to be really careful Kennedy says Jack
is Jessica broad loves that eyeliner
yeah yeah I think I've seen her talk
about it it's amazing let me do a little
swatch on my hand for you and you can
see how black it is black black black
Steph says limited to is justice that's
right they changed it to justice my
daughter loves justice so that's where
that's why I talk about them so my
daughter's always in there she's not
really into makeup though so I don't
have to worry about that stuff yet but
yeah there you go
it's just absolutely beautiful AJ says I
love how next takes risks and doesn't
try to do the high-end brands yeah I
mean I feel like this is kind of a dupe
though this one right here is kind of a
dupe for the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper it does not feather out on the
mod 42:20 love beauty it does not
feather out on me at all and I do have
problems with that I love this one I
love this one especially because like
Dollface is saying it's not a fell
tip the felt-tip ones are very hard and
sometimes I have trouble getting them to
kind of like when you when you push down
on a brush tip you feel it kind of
conforming to your skin where with a
marker tip they're very hard they're
like a marker so you you draw it on but
it doesn't really conform to your skin
you know what I mean that's why I like
these better I do I do like marker tips
but I prefer these brush tips they're
very very nice there's some really good
ones that are high-end like the on the
tart the it's it's a I had it earlier
this year and I can't find it but it's
this real skinny one I can't remember
right off the time I had what it's
called but it's it's so fine so fine
liquid liner from the rainforest sea
collection that one's really good if you
want like a really super fine line like
if you don't want like this is a lot
thicker if you're looking for something
thinner the two-faced one is really good
too so fine fantastic just the same it's
just it's very very thin it's more
expensive though the NYX glitter primer
Brooklyn wants to know I did get to try
that this year and I loved it
if you look at what's it been makeup for
today I have a ton of glitter on my eyes
I have a live stream on periscope you
can swipe through my Twitter to find it
if you want where you can go to what's
been makeup comm to see that but I was
trying it on you can see me doing it
live but I'll tell you what happened
I used the lit glitter and I can't
remember which one it's called I think
it's like diva or something like that
I'll put it in the video description if
I can remember but I tried the NYX
glitter on one eye and the lik litter on
the other and when I tried to blend a
little bit more shadow into my crease
the lit glitter the eye shadow
completely pulled the glitter off but
the NYX glitter glue it stayed on much
better so I ended up taking the NYX
glitter glue and putting it over top of
the lint glitter because it was just
better than the lit glitter so I haven't
put it hides ahead yet with the Too
Faced one yet the Too Faced glitter glue
and the NYX glitter glue but right now I
am loving the next glitter glue it is
super fab and style says my favorite
felt tip liners from Jessie's Girl I
think it's only at Rite Aid and it's 399
is it 399 now last time I checked it was
way more than that Wow
and it doesn't break apart my crease
like the Kat Von D
the the Jesse's girl was my holy grail
for a really long time and then I
started trying some other ones and it
kind of fell by the wayside also it's
kind of difficult to find at least in my
area it's very difficult to find they
don't sell it in stores I have to buy it
online they they sell some Jesse's girl
stuff in my store but they don't sell
the liner so I have to buy mine online
so when I found the Nick step again kind
of put Jesse's girl to the side but I
agree it is also very good it reminds me
a little more of the Physicians Formula
liner the Jesse's girl I find the next
one to be a little bit more opaque true
Beauty says would you recommend violet
Voss
yes I have tried two of their eyeshadow
palettes one of them was mine and one of
them I borrowed from my friend sahaja
who I ended up sending it back I tried
the Laura Lee palette and I send it back
to sahaja after I tried it we were doing
that for a little while where she was
sending me stuff and I was sending it
back to her so that I could try it I do
have the Holy Grail palette and I do
have a full review on that comparing to
I can't remember what I'm comparing it
to the Anasazi of Beverly Hills modern
Renaissance I think I can't remember but
I do have a video on that on the violet
vos and it is a really great formula
it's nice I wish they would get a little
more creative with their color
selections though I feel like the last
palette they came out with it was at a
creative color selection was in a khole
Concilio palette I felt like that one
was a little bit more out of the box but
I wish that I feel like violet Wallace
could do so much better in their color
selection for their palettes that's just
my opinion
it's like 90 shades of brown it's like
you know or fifty shades of brown it's
like I like morphing like what are you
doing what are you doing why why why why
50 seat shades of brown why do we really
need that do we really need one that's
one shade like barely any difference it
looks the same on the eye especially if
you're blending in the crease is stupid
so Lisa says compare steal it to the
Nick epic Nick's epic and I like the
Knicks better the Stila I don't I don't
think the lasting power is as good and
that like when I go like this on the
side of my face I have like this big
mush on my eye and also I find this
killer will seep into my fine lines a
little bit so I think the Nicks is
better than the Stila that's my opinion
and Gigi says the same thing Nick's
liner is better than steel I of both I I
definitely yeah I agree
alright so let's go ahead and move on
let's go to the last brand I wanted to
mention to you which is Laura
I recently got on the Rockstar list
which I'm super excited about because
I'm a huge fan of lorac to stand out for
me this year from lorac was the Pirates
of the Caribbean palette oh my gosh if
you can still find this anywhere it's
been on discount I don't know if it's
still available anywhere but I am I love
this palette it's up there with with my
Urban Decay owls through the
looking-glass palette as far as how much
I love it for like limited edition
palettes of course it's huge its bulky
all of that like I get it but the
quality of the shadows in here are
awesome I love the shade selection this
shade C haze is so fun and this shades
starry night is so fun
I mean swatch those for you this is a
little bit like house same dose of
colors is like super BAM in your face
these are a little bit calmer but the
pigmentation is wonderful and the and
the blend ability is wonderful and the
wear time is wonderful I did try the
ladies who brunch or beauties who
brought whatever that was the brunch
stuff I did not like that stuff at all I
thought it was awful it was powdery it
was I did not like it it was not good I
ended up returning it it was terrible
but the Pirates of the Caribbean
I loved the blush palette from Pirates
of the Caribbean it's got this little
door in here I do have a full review of
it it is super cute I've put tons of
graphics in it it's got pirate music it
is one of my favorite videos I made this
year was my pirate to the Caribbean
review if you haven't seen it it's it's
really cute I'm very proud of that video
but anyway so this blush palette was
fantastic definitely one of my favorite
products of the year this blush palette
just always incredible it's got these
like highlighter more highlighter he
blushes here like this one I've worn on
its own without a blush just this high
as like a highlighter slash blush
together and it's gorgeous you can see
the pan starting to dig in which for me
doesn't happen should show so much I've
used it but the only my only critique
for this one was that it's not friendly
for deeper skin tones I don't believe I
feel like it would get lost on a deeper
skin tone I wish that they had gotten
rid of one of these highlighter kind of
shades like maybe gotten rid of this
white one and done a really deep blush
because I feel like this this
highlighter would look beautiful on a
deeper skin tone but I feel like like
this one is kind of useless yes that
says I'm pale
to dream exactly I feel like this is
beautiful for pale to my skin tones but
anybody deep well I think somebody
medium skin tone could probably use it
but formula wise it's fantastic I also
tried some stuff from the witch I never
ever showed you I don't think I ever
showed this on the channel but I bought
the Beauty and the Beast because I have
this thing you know it's collection
thing like I want to collect I shut up
how's that look like books that are from
movies and stuff so I did get the Beauty
and the Beast I don't think I ever
showed this I don't remember if I did or
not to be honest I used this a couple of
times I haven't used this a lot but I
really enjoyed it a couple of times I've
used it it really is just a very natural
look it's got some deeper shades which
is very nice the shade selection here is
beautiful you got a couple of pops of
color but mostly very neutral which goes
with the theme of Beauty and the Beast
and I really enjoyed this it is magnetic
so the brush that comes with it pops out
of here sometimes again big and bulky
but I love the formula it is super super
fab
I also tried the lip glosses from the
set and I really love the lip glosses
I've been using those a lot too top
liquid lipsticks that are uncomfortable
I've been using the lorac glosses a lot
so I've that was the first time I ever
tried to look Rach gloss formula really
enjoying it and then from the Pirates
collection I tried one of their gloss /
lipsticks really enjoyed those as well
didn't really like the shame that I got
I got Sparrow and it's like this gray
shade which I don't really like but I
did really like the gloss I wear that
overtop too because it's got kind of an
iridescent to it I've worn that over top
of liquid lipsticks it's absolutely
beautiful absolutely beautiful they
recently sent me the mega pro 4 palette
and I've used this a couple of times and
really enjoyed this as well so you can
see I haven't hardly used this but when
I have used it I've really liked it
recently I did like a blue smokey eye
and I use this for the majority of that
look and really been enjoying this as
well so I'm really looking forward to
seeing what lorac comes out with in the
next year they did recently send me
their original Pro palette which I
already own and their contour palette so
I am going to probably be doing a
giveaway on Instagram for those I want
to do more Instagram giveaways because
they're pretty easy to do so makes
you're following me on Instagram for PR
giveaways of things that I already own
right now I do have a giveaway on there
right now for some sheet masks from PHA
story so check that out if you're
interested in that that's a giveaway
going on Instagram right now it started
yesterday
so anyway is lorac cruelty free you know
what I don't have that information in my
brain right now
I don't know assembled in the u.s. of us
and non-us materials I forget I haven't
reviewed it lorac palette in a while let
me look it up real quick
because this is important cool treat and
then we're gonna get into the brands
that I want to try in 2018 let's see
2016 policy this is on cruelty free
kitty does lorac test on animals policy
2016 after a recent email from the
company I no longer support lorac nor
can I maintain that they are cruelty
free company lorac isn't sold in China
but it's ambiguous whether or not their
ingredients are tested on animals
please read their response below it used
to be that they're a hundred percent
cruelty free okay so it says okay here
we go thank you for contacting the raw
cosmetics yes I remember this now lorac
does not test our final products on
animals and we are of not aware of any
animal testing performed by any
manufacturer with whom lorac does
business
okay then lorac does not condone the
testing of any cosmetic products on
animals and asks all suppliers to
support this point of view and all
suppliers state that they do so lorac
cannot warrant or certify that all
suppliers who say they do not test on
animals do in fact on animals in fact do
not test on animals because they do get
products some of the products that they
get there are then the raw ingredients
are from China so that companies are
saying that they are they don't test on
animals but lorac can't guarantee that
they're telling the truth so that's
where they're that's where they're stuck
so I appreciate that Little Rock is
being so incredibly honest because I
think that they could say straight up
that they are cruelty-free company
because all their suppliers say that
they're cruelty-free but lorac is saying
you know they could be lying to me and
we don't know because they could lie so
I
mmm I guess you're gonna have to look
into your heart on that one cruelty-free
kitty says no they cannot support but I
I honestly like I think that a lot of
companies probably just take the word of
those Chinese you know the Chinese man
you the the suppliers from China I think
that they probably just take their word
and would never say hey we can't
guarantee that they're not lying to us
you know what I mean
so I don't know oh no but you got to
look in your heart on that one of
whether you think I don't know I don't
know that's a tough one that's a real
tough one all right so anyway let's go
ahead and move on to products and brands
that I want to try in 2018 that I want
to try more of so I would really like to
get some advice on some products that
you really left from these brands so the
first one is milk make up milk make up
I've tried a couple of things I've tried
they're at lip glosses really enjoy the
lip glosses I tried one of their I paint
things it's like a little tube that has
like really really pigmented eyeshadow
like cream eyeshadow in it it was too
much like it's like it goes on like ink
and then it dries really fast and it's
really difficult to work with even
though it's super pigmented so I would
really like to try more from them oh I
bought a holographic highlighter stick
thing and I haven't used it yet in that
weird like I bought it and then it's
like I look at it and go why did I buy a
holographic hot liquor like what what
what what do I even do with this mister
says I love them the eye pigments that's
good to know but I'd like to try more
from them because I feel like that like
what the in an interaction with Jackie I
not how they took her advice and they
were trying to talk to her about how to
make their stuff better I love that I
absolutely love that tatianna says I
have their blur primer wait I missed it
I went too fast when we go back to
tatianna tatianna says love their blur
stick from milk I do own that and I
personally didn't see any I have a guy I
got with a tramp travel set for my
friend Nancy that I think is still here
hi Nancy Nancy sent me like a little
travel set that has like a couple
different of those milk sticks I really
didn't see anything magical happening
with my skin with those but I would
imagine somebody with larger pores maybe
it would do
better Tim says milk makeup tattoo
stamps are cute Brianna says they say
that Renea maybe Renea that's the way I
would phonetically pronounce it I hope
I'm saying it right also loves the milk
blur stick I feel really bad when I
don't say names right Jennifer says a
blur stick is terrible it pills up oh
wow
Mariana says milk water stick is
interesting Oh cauliflower hello my
friends she says I only have one product
a blush and a cheek stick and I would
and I like it but would like to try
other things yeah Nermin says the bomb I
own pretty much everything from the bomb
that I am a bomb the bomb collector I
think I own probably 90% of their line I
have two videos of brand reviews of the
bomb so I probably won't purchase
anything from the balm this year they'd
have sent me some PR in the past as well
but yeah any any time you want knowing
about any products from the balm I've
probably tried it Renee okay Renee Renee
got it
Renee till the okay though everyone says
wrong I know I'm so sorry that my mom's
name is Rana and people call her Rona
all the time she hates it
Jeana says um yeah well anyone says my
name wrong is just ugly
Jeana they say Jeana wrong it's Jeana
unless you pronounce it differently
alright let's move on to the next one I
thought just saw someone mentioned one
of the ones I'm gonna talk about look at
this next liner I can't get it off yeah
I can't get enough
alright see ah today is another brand
that I want to try more from when ciate
first launched makeup well first let's
start with the nail polish I tried some
CIT nail polish it was just okay for me
it wasn't fantastic just okay then I
tried their mascara when they first came
out with mascara and I hated it it was
one of the worst mascaras I've ever
tried so I was kind of like ciate sucks
in my head I was like ciate sucks their
products suck but then I've heard
recently that people are saying that
ciate actually has some really good
products I saw them at an event I think
it was either generation beauty or it
was either generation Peter eye masks
there's only two I go to but I think it
was generation Beauty made some
highlighters that looked really really
interesting what's keeping me from
trying ciate is the price point and
because I had really bad experience with
well not really bad but just not
positive experience with other other
their products it's like when I see the
price point on it I'm like nope nope I'm
not spending my money on that I'm like
scared to try it again because I don't
want to waste my money
Janis G janilla I got it Jamia says I
love the ciate bronzer the liquid lip is
pretty decent good to know
Cynthia says the glitter lipstick is fun
I've seen those those look really really
fun Cindy says oh yes I want to try to
CIT especially the glitter flip lipstick
it does look really interesting I think
Christy did a review of that it was very
interesting oh yeah she says that what
they were Jim unity yes thank you so
much acorn and Bo says ciate liquid lips
remind me of Oh Rose good to know and
then siggy says that the C on say liquid
lips are so comfortable well that's good
to know
well I'm glad okay well this is good
stuff Rebecca says ciate seems a bit
gimmicky yeah well I mean they're trying
to sell stuff so I have no problem with
gimmicky as long as it works you can be
a gimmicky from here to there but if
your product is terrible then I get mad
but if you if your gimmicky and it works
and it's nice I got no problem with
gimmicky Mariana says Jenna Nek beauty
products I have nothing on my list
k-beauty why's that I want to try right
now in my brain I've tried I tried a lot
of K Beauty this year I want to do a
okay Beauty countdown of the worst
products I tried all the way up to the
best because I did have that series this
year called what the K that I spent a
lot of time on it wasn't very popular on
the channels when I killed it
but I do want to do one more at least
one more what the K video where I
countdown the Korean beauty products
that I tried from the worst to the best
so Ziggy says ah Jim thanks for noticing
me love you love you back
hi Elise Elise says agree about gimmicky
working I like what gimmicks work me too
they're fun I'm totally with you another
one that I haven't tried much from in
really long time is hard candy
I tried some hard candy eyeshadows a
while back and they were pretty awful
they were not good they were bad they
were bad drugstore bad drugstore stuff
not good but I've heard some good things
about them recently that they've been
coming out some really interesting
products I would really like to try some
more things
janay thank you so much I said jamia
janae I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it
I want to get it right georgette said I
really like what the cake thank you so
much I really liked it too Angie says if
you tried dirty little secret yes I
haven't really liked their products
they're liquid lipsticks for not for me
they were crumbly and dry and did not
like them I do have a lot of them don't
let them I've gotten a lot of them it
with PR stuff I not enjoyed dirty little
secret products what was the other thing
I try from dirty little secrets
what's a lip balm thing or something I
don't know I haven't really liked
anything from them which is sad because
they're an indie company and I'm always
rooting for indie companies but I really
didn't like it V says I'll hide me from
the dreamcatcher she said what about
flower beauty I just published a we're
testing they're setting spray I haven't
tried a single thing from flower beauty
I don't think I think I've ever tried
anything that's another one that I
definitely should try Thank You V for
that
I appreciate it Brianna says Genevieve
Oh flower beauty sponge I've heard good
things about the flower beauty sponge
Briana I have not tried it that's great
to know Naomi says I like super
pigmented shadows because you can share
them out rather than building up a sheer
shot yeah I told I'm totally with you
cauliflower says I for some reason
you're your real name is going out of my
head I know I knew it at one point what
your real name was and it's really
making me upset because you've been
subscribed to my channel forever and
I've met you like three times and your
real name is going out of my head and
it's very embarrassing and I'm sorry but
she says hard can't be improved a lot
bought a 10 dollar palette from earlier
this year
that was really good Tati recommended it
- very cool see there you go I need to
stop calling out what I'm gonna mention
no one is like calling me out girl call
me out all right next one
Physicians Formula okay so Physicians
Formula if you don't know they just came
out with they just came out with some
new shades of their butter bronzer I do
like the original butter bronzer I
really don't like the smell of it don't
like it at all
the smell is way too strong for me I
don't like the smell of suntan lotion it
just grosses me out so I don't like the
smell but I do like the performance of
it so I think it's great that they came
out with new shades of it also I got a
chance to swatch some of the new
highlighters they're like super super
wet they seem really neat
but then the other thing that's stopping
with Physicians Formula is the price
again I feel like they're just so
expensive for a drugstore brand they're
so expensive so I really want to make
sure I'm trying the products that are
the best because I feel like there's so
many products I mean you've got this
huge wall of products and I look at it
and it's like okay $15 for a mascara or
you know $20 for a you know foundation
it's like oh my gosh
so I want to make sure I get some really
good advice as far as what what to try
from Physicians Formula
janay says Physicians Formula so amazing
love the butter the butt of the bronze
booster and no smell oh good to know
Julie says I'm tired of all my makeup
smelling like food I don't think I'm
ever gonna get tired of makeup smelling
like food what I don't like is my makeup
smelling like roses and suntan lotion
those are not my favorite scents but I
don't mind a really smell like food
that's just me personally I like the
chocolate and the vanilla and all of
that that stuff makes me happy but
that's just me everybody's got their
things let's say amber says the new Olay
whip is $37.99 holy moly Marinella says
I love the butter bronzer I will be
taking it with me to a convention next
weekend yes the price does get me too
yeah I know I know
lavender roses the new healthy lip
liquid lick lipsticks lip liquid
lipsticks oh my gosh are stunningly
beautiful long wearing and super
comfortable worth every penny so great
to know katrina says that butter bronzer
is the only thing that's worth it and
then oh man I lost it someone from
Australia I lost that rose something
where did it go where did going lost it
no
I lost it I missed it
I'm such a such a bummer and like
disappeared Charlie says unpopular
opinion but I also love the violet in
L'Oreal lipsticks okay good to know
I don't know anything about that I don't
mind L'Oreal lipsticks I don't think
they're great but I don't think they're
terrible they've been fine for me just
okay oh there you go Mariana reap what
we posted here in Australia the butter
bronzer is $35 I don't know what the
what the conversion rate is for
Australian to USD see now I have to look
that up aud/usd to AUD is the dollar 33
so it looks like it's similar to the
Canadian Canadian is a 1.28 so it looks
like it's a little bit more for
Australia that's interesting but that's
still ridiculous that's stupid
can you put it back in AUD so what would
that be USD so 30 you said 35 that's 446
wait knowing 35 Australian dollars is
$26 I'm USD that's that's ridiculous
that's insane that's absolutely insane
all right so next one is the one that
was predicted by like five people's Oh
Abba everybody's asking me tries the
weather everybody's like Jan you got
tries to have you guys so he's whoever's
you guys Sozo ever will probably show it
like a shovel on my channel in 2018
probably show up it's just something
that just has to catch my eye and be
like yes that's the thing I need to buy
and that's the thing I need to try I
haven't gotten any so ever yet not
anything I've heard their brushes are
great I've heard their eyes shadows in
green I've heard they're just great all
around and yeah I'm excited about doing
oh I think so Eva's gonna be a one that
blows up this year I there's so much
positive out there for Zoo Ewa mine for
20 says Fanta beauty I have tried some
Fendi stuff and I'm gonna be very honest
with you about my feeling about venting
I don't think it's that great and I I
it's nothing against Rihanna
it's nothing against venti in general
it's just it's just okay for me it's
nothing that's making me go yes it's
just fine I've tried I have their
eyeshadow palette I have one of the
liquid lipsticks the the to be ones that
I just watch it in store it was
beautiful and it was fine the lip gloss
I like the lip gloss and lip gloss is
probably one of my favorite things the
foundation it takes up on me like like
on my chin and on my nose I don't know
why it's really weird but fenty has not
been a star for me this year I have not
been impressed with it and I know that
people are just dying over Fenty and you
dare say anything about Rihanna it's
like saying anything about Beyonce like
you just don't you just don't say
anything bad about Rihanna and I'm not
saying anything bad about her I'm saying
her makeup is not that great that's my
opinion she seems like a wonderful
person I mean I've seen interviews with
her she seems like a beautiful person
she's beautiful her voice is incredible
but Angela Angela wants to know what
does the fancy Foundation feel like she
has dry canon scanning she's kind of
weird if it doesn't I don't know it I
don't find it to be particularly a
specific feel like it's not particularly
dry feeling or particularly like
silicone feeling it just feels wet no
mama Shawna says it's for oily skin good
to know
and then cauliflower was giving the
advice she says don't do fenty for dry
skin it's too matte I've heard that that
it's dry dry dry Rebecca says Janine
says I would not use Fenty if your skin
is dry and i have normal skin and it's
seriously like it it like cracks up
right here and on my chin it's so weird
and that never happens to me one day I
want to do I would like to do which I
say I'm gonna do all these things like I
said earlier and then it never happens
but like half my face someone recommend
this I think it's a great idea like have
my face with like drugstore and half
high-end with formula dupes so like I
bought the ciothes and the ciate I'm
calling my fiance I bought the Catrice
foundation that's that's almost exactly
formula wise the same as the Fenty that
stuff smells awful not awful it doesn't
bad smell but it's so strong gives me
headache smells really strong the
Catrice one I also got the drops the
color-changing drops so that I could
show like how it changes color like how
you could make different shades of like
the fenty with the with the drops I
never made that video like it's such a
good idea for video I never made it so
I'm
I would like to do that video like the
the formula dupes like brow pencil tubes
so many formula dupes out there for
different high-end brow pencils stuff
like that maybe just take a lot of
research to find the formula juice
because you know you got a like search
and search and search and dig and dig
and dig and it just takes forever
eventual assesses anyone like the
Catrice it does the same thing to me as
the fenty does where it takes up on the
side of my nose I don't know why she
picked that Foundation as the one to
start with you know what I mean as like
the base part because it's almost
exactly the same the only difference is
is that at the end of the fenty
ingredients there's a bunch of like
essences ins like I forget what it is
it's like um like extracts and stuff
like that and I think that's the cover
up the smell I honestly yeah I think it
would be a good I think it would be a
good video it's just it's it take just
takes a lot of work and like right now
I'm like really working hard on this the
bad habit video that thing is killing me
man like the research for it and the
filming of it all the swatches I'm gonna
do the anastasi of Beverly Hills one so
we're doing the modern Renaissance to
the subculture dupe and the prism Juke
and we're going to swatches of
everything we're gonna talk about the
formulas of everything we're going to
compare everything but it's taking me
forever it was supposed to be up like a
week ago and I can't get it done it's
it's taking way too long
alright I just went off on a tangent
let's talk about the next brand so so
ever
definitely a brand I want to try next up
his makeup monsters I've heard wonderful
things especially after going to go
visit Stephanie I've heard he is she
loves her makeup munch monsters I really
want to try those those the liquid
lipsticks from makeup monsters they look
amazing and I've heard great things so I
haven't um I've never heard anybody say
anything negative about makeup monsters
liquid lipstick so that's something that
I would really love to try Gigi says I'm
fair fair too in the physician's formula
butter is super light so you can build
it doesn't turn orange on me
I really like it a lot what's Steph's
and that's so funny Nancy's laughing at
stuff Stefan is hilarious do not get me
started on Kylie
don't do it i i've been going off with
the mouth - kylie go on twitter you want
to see me going off with the mouth let's
go over my twitter i have i have i mean
i'm not mean to her but it's like girl
you got to tell me why this brush set is
so expensive just tell me why tell me
why I should spend $360 on your brushes
what makes them so special why are they
worth that price you need to tell me you
cannot release a price like that and
with no details
remember when Wayne Goss dropped his
brushes and he's talking about how you
know they're handmade in Japan and
they're this kind of brush hair and blah
blah blah he went on and on about why
why why should we pay that price she did
not do that she just released this
picture of this cheap looking brush set
she's got to do better she's got to do
better so I I got I got some tweets some
tweets in to Kylie about that hopefully
she explains herself if you don't know
anything about what I'm talking about
the one of the top news stories for
what's the make up today is all about it
it's it's sick it's stupid so makeup
monsters bad chimera go at moms or mega
monsters I want to try their liquid
lipsticks this year I'd love to next up
is aroma Lea cosmetics he has some
really it's another indie brand it's
spelled arom a le I G H I think I got
that right I'm hoping aroma lis they
have some really really beautiful
eyeshadows some of them are duo crumbs
I'm a huge fan of duochrome eyeshadows
so I would love to try some of those
Nancy and Stepford is going back and
forth sorry sorry those of you on the
replay I'm trying to keep up with what
they're talking about but yeah Romilly
just really look I've heard great things
about the quality of their eyeshadows
I've liked I look and see the swatches
and they're beautiful I love that they
do they do things a little bit different
like they have a Queen's like a I love I
don't know if you guys know this about
me but I love European history and like
learning about the different kings and
queens and stuff I went on an Elizabeth
the first like learning rampage a couple
months ago where I was like trying to
learn everything I could about Elizabeth
the first it's so so so interesting
so when she did the wives of I think
aroma Li did the the wives of Henry the
eighth I know that there's a Oh what's
your name it's like my brain just went
ah bah bah bah the one that copy hadded
they don't like four of them got
beheaded three of them got beheaded
Boleyn am Bolin took me a second Amba
Lynch they did like an amble in
collection stuff like that which totally
sells me I mean I think that stuff is
super cool I wish that they were though
somehow like contained in a packaging
that they could stay together that's the
thing that makes me hesitant to buy the
single eyeshadows from indie brands is
that they end up just scattered
everywhere in my collection these little
pots everywhere little pots and I want
some way to contain them yeah
everybody's I can Belen yes ambolyn
that's like the one that got her head
chopped off which one got their heads
chopped off which is not funny I don't
know why I'm giggling I guess I don't
know I'm tired I guess
but anyway oh my gosh Jen oh missile
wants to know if I watch the show the
cheaters I did not watch that I should
though cuz I think it's all fictional
isn't that like I want the real stuff I
don't want the fake stuff Philippa
Gregory yes I read a couple of her books
where she wrote some historical fiction
I did and I loved the books that I read
by her I loved them Banshee news the
Anne Boleyn is a Romilly cosmetics
that's one that I really want to try and
then the last one that's on my list is
Sydney Grace cosmetics which used to be
Feather River body oh my gosh everybody
tells me I need to try Feather River
body and now everybody's like Sydney
Grace ending grace ending grace again

cool looking shadows so I really like to
try those very excited about that brand
everybody seems to be raving about them

I'm out of Show I need more shows on
Netflix to watch so April says no we're
in history is good for women that's true
that's a good point that's a good point
it's true hopefully in the future it
will be though everybody saying no
interest in 7-eleven no one wants
7-eleven makeup if you don't know
7-eleven it's a convenience store that
released a lot of 7-eleven stuff Amy
says Taylor did the 7-eleven save your
money okay I did see that Taylor
released it I haven't washed it yet
Teresa says 7-eleven makes your face
sting oh my gosh
everybody's like no okay I'm not gonna
do it I'm not gonna do what everybody's
like you know don't do it I won't do it

general consensus of do not do the
7-eleven makeup I've never seen anybody
any group ever tell me
SOCAN so consistently don't do it wow oh
my gosh that's amazing okay well that's
decided Jen will not be reviewing
7-eleven makeup

there am i okay there we go
Felicia says because we care Jen that
stuff is probably horrible Thank You
Felicia I love you girlfriend
Mimi says that was yesterday taarna
Julie says what color rain restocked the
Queen of Hearts I thought they already
did I thought they already did and
Tabitha says that Chris Anna and from
Chris Anna and cosmetics is in the house
hello Chris Anna good to see you
definitely check out their products as
well I've really been enjoying the the
olympus palette from them i don't know
why i didn't include them in this why
didn't i it but i've really been
enjoying the olympus palette it's really
beautiful it's kind of in a mid-range
between like the the lorac and the
coloured raine where they're not as
pigmented as the coloured raine but they
seem to be a little more pigmented than
like mono no I wouldn't say that I feel
um I'm trying to trying to think how to
describe them because they're really not
similar to either one of those now that
I'm thinking about it I guess they're
more they're more similar to lorac but
they're not as pigmented they're not as
buttery ads the lorac the eyeshadows
they're a little more user friendly for
people that aren't used to using a lot
of makeup so they're a little easier
like they build very nicely they start
off very light and then they build so if
you like that kind of formula chrisannan
cosmetics is a great place to get
eyeshadow and they're very very
inexpensive so Joe Smith says what do
you think of BH Cosmetics BH Cosmetics
I kind of have a love-hate relationship
I've there I think it was that's heart
collection and it was awful
I did not enjoy it at all the temptation
was terrible it was it was awful but I
do really like their baked eyeshadow
formula so I have the city chic
what is it geek chic no nukkie cheek
chic some kind of chic look is it gone I
can't remember it's like space chic or
something any room would it's called oh
my gosh why is it out of my head I
forget what it's called
but what is it galaxy chic space chic oh
my gosh watching this on the replay this
is the love of a livestream the love of
a live stream right now galaxy chic I
love that palette it's super fab one is
like galaxy I know it's a 30 second
delay before you can help me yeah galaxy
chic I love that palette I've had that
palette forever and I still love it
georgette said I was the winner in that
coloured raine giveaway and they sent me
the Queen of Hearts pout and all their
satin lippies oh my gosh congratulations
that's amazing
so BH Cosmetics has definitely been
hitting this I've never tried their
brushes before I should actually I might
have tried one or two of their brushes
and I don't remember them being stand
out amazing but I don't remember them
being bad but I know traces like space
chic I know I don't know I don't know
but we've got two minutes left so Amer
and I was like Jen needs more coffee I
know I do
it's princesses I want space chic me too
we should invent it together Teresa
Teresa and I are starting a makeup brand
did you know that it's called space chic
and everything is gonna be space themed
me and you Teresa we've got this Erin
said can you do Snow White Emily Noel
loved it I think I'm kind of past that
at this point I think if I get it it's
gonna be too late I mean you got it you
got to get the timing on that and I
think I'm by the time I get it and try
it cuz it takes me to three weeks to try
something so I'm always it's gonna be
rare that you see a video on my channel
that's before everybody else because I
like to really try things before I
review things so
Danny says I love your reviews we're on
the same we're the same age
so that makes totally worth watching my
opinion oh that's cool Rebecca says I
totally buy space chic well Teresa and I
were rich but we're doing it together
fancy news says Wayne Goss brushes Oh
have a Burt's Bees in it cosmetics with
some brands I want to try soon
sounds good I have a couple Wayne Goss
brushes and I really enjoy them Ezra
says BH zodiac palette I haven't heard
much about that I know Christy did a
review and I know she wasn't super happy
with her look that she came up up with
but I didn't watch the video georgette
says never too late Jen we will always
watch you I myself enjoy kind of oh
thank you
Gigi says first impression videos are
useless oh you know what Gigi I get it
like I don't feel like they're
completely useless I just don't think
that they're the best videos you know
where I feel like there is something to
be said in the first impression and you
can get a idea of something it's almost
like watching the first 15 minutes of a
movie you know or a television show you
watch the first 15 minutes you can kind
of get an idea but it's going to be like
but it's not the full it's not the same
thing as a review of the whole thing you
know what I mean so there is value in it
to me but I don't think that it's I
think it's better to watch the whole
movie before you before you review it
you know what I mean that's the way I
think about it anyway but I think we're
tests are definitely definitely going to
and we're tests over multiple days I
think are the best but the thing is is
YouTube doesn't favor that YouTube
favors the people that get the videos
out the fastest and that's why you see
the bigger youtubers doing the first
impression where tests doing the
unboxings and things like that because
if you were the first person to get it
out though those are the people that get
the views so that's why they're doing it
and that's why their channels are much
bigger than mine so you know share my
videos no no I'm not kidding I'm kidding
I'm not kidding you know but but that's
why but I feel like I would rather have
less subscribers and do a do you know
and make sure I'm doing a job that I can
be super proud of you know what I mean
Elizabeth says in all caps PR buy
unboxings need to die I don't feel like
they need to die they I think they have
their place I don't get enough PR to do
them number
but number two I don't they're not my
favorites either but you know everyone
has their different preferences and
everyone has a right to watch what they
want now if you don't like a video just
skip by it that's what I do with most
unboxings I just skip past it but
alright my battery is dying I have 9%
and we are at one hour and one minute so
I'm going to go ahead and pop off of
here thank you guys so much for being
here I really appreciate it and my
filming schedule is kind of changing a
little bit with the holidays and
everything so there may only be two
other videos this week up rather than
three usually I do Monday Wednesday and
Friday but because of the holiday season
and you know doing a lot of things
Tuesday and Thursday may be better just
to do two videos at least until I get
past the holidays and then go back into
the grind of the three videos once I hit
once January hits so keep an eye out on
my channel for videos maybe not on my
regular days on Monday Wednesday and
Friday
but also know that make up minute is
still going to be Monday through Friday
that one minute news for you and then
Instagram we have the makeup minute
extras over there again I have the
giveaway going on for that face story
sheet mask box on Instagram keep an eye
out for the lorac giveaway coming up
soon for the pro palette the original
Pro palette and the contour palette I'm
not sure if I'm going to give away the
contour palette yet or no I haven't
decided but I'm definitely giving away
the profile because I already own it

today Aliso space story is Bay and just
so you know I am NOT sponsored by face
story they just send it to me every
month and I don't know why they never
asked they never contacted me and said

use it you know give it to someone that
can so alright I'm gonna go ahead and
