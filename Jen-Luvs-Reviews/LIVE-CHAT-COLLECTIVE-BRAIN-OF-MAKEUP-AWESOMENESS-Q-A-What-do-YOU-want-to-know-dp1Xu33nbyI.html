questions and you have an opinion you

reported the collective BriTANicK the
bossiness saving ourselves money from

go ahead and say hello to the collective
brain go to the people that are here at
live if you are here watching on the
replay you were also part of the
collective brain but I just can't talk
you break the second because you're not
hearing this moment right now but we can
chat later in the comments down below
this video so I'm going to scroll up to
the very tippy top of the entry when
people coming into the chat and say it's
people that were heroes I was have a
little conversation with those some of
the first people here so I gotta skip
past my own comments here Carissa is
here Brianna hello to you Linda is here
Linda made me some coffee people sent it
through the through the computer to me
Linda did in myeloma thanks Linda
cheyenne is here with amanda is here
marilyn is in the homes so we put our
clocks back last night so you are you're

weird cuz mine says ten o'clock are you

that the right weekend what we supposed
to sit back and usually my computer
clips on that that's so weird let's see
amanda says my gold lip and what's up
Nick of this gorgeous thank you so much
I fought with that lip I thought with it
I fought with it if you go to what's up
makeup calm you'll be able to see the
periscope that I did at least you should
be able to hopefully Tabitha god it
worked out I just realized they don't
have my phone with me boom um hilfe the
tab we got it worked out to put it up on
the website so you can see the getting
ready with me but thank you so much it's
a combination of a two-faced lipstick um
what is it called hold on right here
it's right on top somewhere in hold on
hold on hold on okay but anyway it's a
two-faced lipstick I will put it in the
description it's like Sonos um oh here
this oh yeah here is sorry not sorry I
was like so not so sorry not sorry I was
closed and then I've had it on the Pat
McGrath stuff here and I learned that
the Pat McGrath the the pot that came
with these years you're for kids really
needs the gloss that comes with it
because I try it with a different loss
and it did work as well as the Pat
McGrath loss just so you know but yeah
so it wasn't quite as poppy of a bull
gold lift as I wanted but it worked out
a budget liked it Amanda jenna is here
that girl with curls is here watching
this washing finishes packing for
apartment for move tomorrow oh good luck
with that very good luck with that Joan
is here Vicky is here Karen is here um

feet to a two-bedroom nice Gina is here
in Julie and Rosie good morning in San
Diego oh my goodness it must be
early yeah okay karen says glad we can
shop on mobile phones now that makes me
super super happy leave town on mobile
now that's awesome and morning to Aspen
and brianna brianna wants to know Jenny
going to get the tort tortoise pro
palette I've been watching reviews and
people that said that they didn't liked
what i showed us seem to actually let
the eyeshadows in this palette that's
very very interesting I would imagine
they change the formula for it because
they're calling it a pro formula and I
wasn't planning on getting it I've spent
a lot of money recently on stuff that I
need to test so I kind of booked myself
up for the third reviews but it's
definitely possible in the future it's
not in my immediate purpose of what I'm
kicking myself for not getting a the
caffeine like hell because now there's
all of this is it good is it not good
you know morphine ba-ba-ba-ba-ba so I'm
I'm really kicking myself that I did not
get that because when Kathleen swatched
it look insanely gorgeous so i would i
I'm Saturday not purchased that for it
sold out but it is what it is all right
I'm going to go ahead and scroll all the
way down let me see there's any
questions in here all right Mona okay
thank you michelle for helping out
getting people settled i appreciate you
so much michelle is one of our reporters
and she's a moderator for your on the
chat so yay Khloe says it's a random
hotel cafe back do you think it's worth
the money ok I filmed a review of this
and the other two faced holiday kit the
Sapporo one and that video is going to
be the death of me I have spent so many
hours on that stupid video and I can't
get it to where i like it i just don't
like a lot of things that i did with it
and it's like the stupidest longest
video ever it's really really long so i
have to figure out a self to figure out
how to do it but i'll give you the quick
version of it you have to leave it out
for the smell to go away because the
smell is not good of these pallets in my
opinion it's not good and i think that
overall if you're looking for something
that's more cute than awesome you're
going to really like this if you're
going for something you think is awesome
quality you probably will be
disappointed in it because someone a lot
more quite a few the shadows
how to fall short but they're not bad
not bad quality shadows they're just not
great quality shadows they're not great
for the price of two faced I feel like
to place oh it's not like a I hold
the hell on by the my lose their full um
I feel like the two face I felt kind of
what's happening is it not that they're
getting too big for their britches but
you know they used to act like they used
to spend so much time on the formula and
their quality and making sure that it's
perfect before they put things out and I
feel like in the last year or two
they've been kind of cut in quarters a
little bit it's a kind of push product
out where the formula isn't quite as
good as it used to be I don't know
that's kind of the way that I feel and
they have so many formals the thing is
is is they've got any putting some kind
of work into it because if you look at
their ingredient lists to face I shadows
have so many different formulas it's
insane like every single shadow has its
own formula which is really really weird
where if you look at what the lorac how
it they may have three formulas for the
entire palette you know where two faces
every shadow is different form oh it's
so weird look almost like they z32
severely simplify it like fine the
formula look works really well I mean
this is not being a chemist and never
have a design Margera pilot in my entire
life online expert I don't know but just
from looking at other other brands and
what they do to provide consistent
quality like maybe they're just
overdoing it with the formulas and how
many of them over complicating it where
they need to just kind of go back to
basics and just really put out a great
great great form on you know what I'm
saying so I don't know I'm just I'm a
little disenchanted with lotsa form with
the two-faced I don't feel like they've
been putting your heart into their
products in the past year or two so I
don't know that's just me and they used
to be my favorite brands and I don't
know I can't really save in my favorite
bring more I don't even believe I have a
favor for any more because every brand
is letting me down it's all TT er Elysia
says without quality there is more
quantity and this is the thing this is
the thing with makeup people will buy
things that are pretty even if it's
people buy things with a name on it even
if it's crap and and some people won't
even realize that it's crap because they
get so blinded by the the pretty and so
blinded by the hype then they don't even
realize how bad it is because they're
not really being analytical about it but
this is the thing though is even a
product that I say is crap can be worked
with a lot of times you just need to do
a little bit more maybe you need to
spray a little fix+ on it maybe you need
to wet your brush on Ingrid water maybe
you need to just blend it with other
shadows maybe you need to lay down white
face things like that so even ones that
we can say our crap some people may not
say that because they found a way to
work with it to make it better so beauty
next door's got some caps for me so I
better talk with her it says agreed Jen
to me to face has become so gimmicky and
money hungry and if they release 111
pink or purple eyeshadow on going to
scream oh one more finger / botulism and
and the thing is is like I kind of get
the whole lack of color range because
meaning about like Urban Decay electric
palette with all of the brights you know
how many people are really going to buy
a parent of Albright's a lot of people
but if you're cutting out an entire
chunk of war your purchasers your
clients whatever you want to call them
your potential customers you're cutting
out a big chunk by making all those
brights so you just kind of have to I
don't know you just kind of I can see
where the brands are coming from kind of
putting out the same things already at
all the neutral palettes you know and
when they do put colors in they tend to
put in the same colors they put in
purples because purples work with a lot
of people so you know I can kind of see
that you know mal z says heaps of people
I've seen on YouTube admit they bought
it for the packaging yeah definitely I
mean it happens I think not just people
on YouTube I think a lot of people will
buy things just for packaging Steph said
the metal matt is amazing I need to use
it more I've been slacking on doing my
makeup lately I haven't been doing it as
much as I should I'm going to do my
makeup today because I need to review
that metal Matt it's going to be like a
big priority for it late next week
actually an EVA foam latex with that to
come tomorrow so many I can't even
review it but from so far so good i'm
liking it
I did have a problem i did a neutral
look with the metal matt bike a plenty
let me get it right here i did a look
for my coffee down um I didn't look with
just these shades over here and I found
that the lasting power was not great but
when I use the color over here i'm lazy
twice when i use the green here the
lasting power was amazing i use some of
this stuff over here so I feel like at
least with that one time I did the a
look that the nudes don't stand alone as
far as lasting power that they need like
one of these colors to kind of anchor it
onto the lid I don't know if it's the
same formula and I'm just going crazy or
if it was just that day and I'm sweating
a lot or something I don't know that's
why I'm not ready to review it because
I'm still confused by this cow as far as
lasting power and I do know that some of
the shadows work better than others as
far as a application like tinsel leaves
will leave a bunch of fallout IVs that a
bunch a bunch meaning but why such
pissed but so I mean so far we'll see
we'll see i'm not ready yet I'm not
ready i'm still need to use it more you
lose it one shannon says i like my metal
mat and the mega pro 3 a metal metal mat
by lorac wait what oh the metal map by
the rock I like the metal mat by when
the meadow one by the office was great
this one a one that used to be honest I
don't think they sell the sending what
this thing's amazing this one was great
I'm so thankful that I got this I really
love that um it's a very different
palate than that though jenna says make
up for ever has amazing palettes the
orange palette toy will love those
purples and you know I don't know any of
the Makeup Forever pilots I've never
bought one I just can't even I can't
even I can't even like spend that much I
don't know we spend that much I don't
know I just haven't I haven't wanted to
make up for ever IV anyway says is there
are there any new collections or how
much you're looking forward to no you
know what yeah that's not true you're
not i'm looking forward to I want to try
the new web volt palette that they've
been talking about i'm also very caring
stuffing you too
plays palette that's coming out I'm
really curious about that because I'm
starting to lean toward the ND brands a
little bit you know I mean I any other
violent boss got mixed reviews from a
lot of people especially with the whole
made in kind of thing and all of that
and that's one of the things we to judge
a call for everybody whether you want to
buy something that was manufacturing you
tryna but I really like that palette and
then the judias place I know there's a
lot of drama with them now I've lived in
a color feeling rejected by the brand so
that's a whole other thing that I did
you decide mentally and emotionally
whether i'm going to buy for do this
place when when my friends who are women
of color get upset because they feel
like they're being shunned by by the
brand so I don't know I kind of have to
search my soul on that one leatherman to
buy from Julia's place again I don't
know I haven't decided yet Valerie says
so what did you order yesterday from the
old to sail anything I just basically
restock we ended up just having let the
ask jen like all these things I feel bad
that there's no questions for the
collective brain so far maybe we'll get
some in the future Valerie yes i did get
some things from Ulta I'm trying to
remember off the top of my head because
my phone is downstairs or else I could
scroll down I want to do an essence
brand review so i bought a bunch of
stuff in essence because the things that
I've tracked in essence ever really
really enjoyed and you know that I
always try to find drugstore options
that are really really good so I'm
looking into essence as being one of
those key drugs to our brands where you
can get things that are just as good as
high-end but just cheaper at Ulta so I
bought a bunch of stuff in essence i
also got the Anasazi stick foundation
cuz i really want to try that even
though everybody in the grandmothers
already reviewed it i really want to try
that i'm looking for a good face powder
from from the prestige brands because i
have good face press face powders that I
like from the drugstore but I don't have
any prestige brands so I brought the it
cosmetics I think it's the CC powder I
got that to try it out I also got the
back of blush palette because I don't
own any backup blushes except for the
jaclyn hill college so I wanted to try
more becca blushes I got that
what else and there's more things and
stuff selling things in business stuff
there's more stuff and I can't remember
oh there's like one or two more things I
can't remember I think of it i'll let
you know but they're more they're more
high-end stuff because all the drugs for
stuff I bought was from essence i got
like a blow nose and stuff so if you
weren't on the facebook group yesterday
i posted about how much I be it was a
$183 cart and then I used up all my
points so I saved $125 and a twenty
percent off so i ended up paying with
$23 forever so exuberant cited owns a
gas because i didn't get mailed a code
so i went on the collective brain on
facebook there were a bunch of typed out
putting in their codes if you didn't
know about the otha sale yesterday you
sure to get on the facebook group
because everybody was talking about it
and everybody was given out codes making
sure everybody got their raw got their
codes so definitely be a part of the
facebook group it's growing and growing
growing you got over 5,000 members we've
gotten about 4,000 members in the past
month or so it's pretty amazing how fast
the facebook group is growing and it is
such a nice little group we screen
everybody that comes in we make sure
that you know we don't have sales in the
group we make sure we don't spam in the
group the moderators are in that matter
is put the the admins on the facebook
group i'm one of the admins tabatha
yesenia and catherine we all really keep
up on making sure everybody is safe on
there no one is harassed everyone's nice
to each other it's fantastic show anyway
if you're not number the facebook group
it's definitely worth going over there
because that's how I knew yalta sale was
going on I wouldn't have known if it
worked for my facebook / it's called
what's up and make up I think mention
that group / sports at the makeup but
definitely do that Heather wants to know
what's on my support list I actually
already show up it's for little to David
support i'm doing a so for a hole on my
whatsapp and makeup appt for the paid
section which i haven't uploaded yet so
I can't show you what I got at sephora
yet because I promised them I would show
them first that's going to go live
tomorrow on what satanica app on the
food section I give them extra content
there aren't that many people over there
on the page section but
because they are on the page section
don't you want to give them a little bit
extra as a thank-you so I'm not going to
tell you what I got it support yet but
you will see it on the channel soon
Shannon says I never tried any of those
mascaras get the essence mascaras are
amazing so good I don't know who you're
talking to shannon but the essence
mascaras are awesome they're really
really good and I've got some coming on
the way to retry them again says has I
only bought a few things because I'm
excluding fragrance as per usual I
wanted to use that for fragrance and
everything else at Sephora yeah I get
all my fragrances from from Sanford and
because I'm hard asset bird I don't um I
don't need to buy perfume anymore I have
synthesized confused but I don't buy
them anymore because I've assembly will
need it I don't go through perfume that
fast and I don't really care about
having a fancy bottles and everything I
like yeah it's a bottle thought will
need it i Reichel at the collective rank
question she said the Kat Von D tattoo
liner the only liner that gives me the
finish application control that I want
but it consists it constantly stops
working how are you storing it that's my
question liquid liners are very finicky
as far as how you store them some people
say you should store them flat some
people say you should store them tip
down did you definitely don't want to
store them tip up that is a big deal oh
yeah that one's have hey hey this isn't
jeopardy here tab she says please phrase
your question in the form of a question
I've got you too i understood what she
was trying to say rachel says does
anyone have a recommendation fixed or
another product that's comparable there
um no no anna wants to know about
separate Nicole wants to know what's
Emperor i'll tell you about semper in a
second um and so she loves a big upper
few other show many questions coming in
my brain starting to melt okay phone
isn't getting to stop reading for a
second so so deadly check and see how
you're storing it Rosie says she storage
her liner laying down oh let's see any
other things on that liner okay well
everybody's talking about the liner
while we could go over to talk about the
liner I'll talk to you about um the
semper so Sanford is I think it's
fifteen dollars a month and you when you
sign up you get to pick which perfumes
call
I'll show you the way they come I've
been striving for like two years they
set me some initially when they first
launched they set me some separ to try
and review and then I subscribed so
initially I got it the one the first
perfume for free and then I subscribe so
this is how it comes and it comes well
this is how it comes when you get
refills and you get these vials and what
they do is they just repackage it so
they get the full sizes at their
whatever you know bulk cost that they
get and then they repackage them in
these so that's how they make their
money but fifteen dollars you're getting
like a rollerball size and typically the
rollerball sizes of fancy perfumes are
twenty dollars $22 something like that
so you're getting a deal on how much
product you get and it is a spritz also
you get the when you first order you get
a little atomizer so that you can change
out your perfuse so i don't know where
if i have 1 i'll show you like your
little boy sweat birds so I mean I've
got some other boy balls in here these
are like big roller balls you can see
the size it is well I don't know if this
is it's thinner though so it's kind of
the SEP visually deceptive but those are
all my step birds but I'm no longer like
they don't pay me to talk about them
anymore we didn't pay me a repeated
paying originally either it was just
stuff they sent me the original one for
free let me see if I found if there were
any other things about the liner from
the collective brain laying down there
go uh Heather says tip down for the
liquid liners and Karen said laying down
so try that and see if it works there
are some cheaper alternatives like
Jesse's girl talk about that one all the
time feel like that's an alternative
it's only seven bucks so if it dries out
your only out seven bucks instead of 20
bucks also if you can find their deluxe
samples of the liquid liners it's best
way to go because you really should be
throwing it out every few months so all
right let me go back into Luke and Luke
Duke Bernie if you're asking questions
and I miss
let me know I'm just keep going with the
question just asking again nilo says
this is tempered with unisex perfumes
for men too or just remembered you have
a man subscription and a woman's
subscription let's see Heather says how
do you get through as set bird and
perfume samples not sure what that means
um how do you get through as simpler and
food samples we can figure what that
means i know i i'm i just want to answer
your question incorrectly what if
something I sauce in about Natasha jano
na all right let me sing oh I missed I
missed it oh Vanessa how was Natasha
Genoa for me I really like him talk to
the many shadows I do feel like I wish
they were not so expensive but it's one
of those things when you're some brands
are just more expensive than others and
it is it seems to be great quality so
for a sail off the top of my head I
can't remember but if you go to my
videos there's a makeup minute we
started to make up minute and the make a
minute is just a one minute news segment
that we're putting out monday through
friday hopefully monday through friday
next week definitely monday through
thursday next week's i'm flying on
friday so i can be able to get one on
friday but monday through friday and
it's just one minute news segment so
there's one that says sephora sale and
it tells you the dates right there
Nicole wants to know if I've tried so
schwa I recently joined so far I let
them so schwa when they launched set me
it's spelled s och och IX they sent me a
box when they first launched and I
really enjoyed it but I did not
subscribe I can see why people were
really like it the way so suave works is
that you there's a bunch of luxury
things on their site so maybe you're the
OG vil she or you know giorgio armani or
kind of quad and what they do is they
scooped out some product or they pour
out some product and they give you a
sample that way it's kind of like sent
bird but with luxury makeup so they may
give you a little clam shell pan and
it's for sampling high end makeup and
they do get you like a sample look a
little sample but it's fun it's fun jen
wants to know from
he says foundation for pale skin that is
for the collective brain I guess it
would just depend on which kind of
formula you like I would imagine because
there are a lot of brands that make
foundation shades for pale skin but I I
don't know what what kind of foundation
move like if i remember right Jen you up
oily skin if i remember right i think i
got that right as you know i know my
community pretty well and I think i
think i've been jen has all of his tent
I think she meant that girl with curls
says I love NYX liquid liner wore it
last night as part of my halloween
costume liner on my face and it didn't
crack flick or smudge I ate drank and
kiss and it didn't budge nice that's
fantastic i have tried the next liquid
liner i do find that it smudges on that
smudges what kind of flakes off on the
sides if i have the ring but other than
that it stays great so if you're not
rubbing your face i would imagine it
would be wonderful and it does go on
very black and very easily jenna says if
you buy that Natasha giannone during the
div sale you get $33 off that's a really
good point Jenna really good point at
least says I love the makeup minute to
bring an idea thank you so much and it's
relatively easy for tab and I to do so
she she finds the stories and then I
just I recorded the audio and throw it
all together and it's not too bad amalia
says sabrina subscribes to the two
social ah i would imagine zabrina would
like that Sabrina and I have had a
couple of conversation she's such a
sweetheart Elise says fair-skinned
Rimmel 25 hour where dr. Jarts detox BB
cream there you go snakes honey says kat
von z makes good pale skin foundation
even a white one that's right um yes Oh
teyla that teyla is a youtuber that
reviews pale skin friendly foundations
excellent recommendation and very good
teyla taylor is wonderful if you've
never seen it's that and it was th a TA
y la she's really really good really
good sabrina wants to know where you get
the makeup samples it's called so SWA s
0 CH oh I x.com
and Tabitha just put it up in the chat
okay Janelle says they'll be another
Alta coupon sometime in november
december really well that's interesting
i didn't know that i thought it would
just come back in the spring that's
great anna says speaking of natasha
danone on her new foundation at sephora
in number 10 is great for pale skin
grades true beauty says you can also get
foundation lightning drops that's very
true as well these are great suggestion
from the clep to bring well done well
done mowsey says wish we had access to
foreign oz the USA one hand we did too i
wish i could just teleport you here and
i take you and we go shopping together
Joan says Mabley makes good foundations
for fair skin Julie says I also order
off ebay to get even more that's true
when you go shopping on Alta or support
don't forget to go to be Bates first
there's no reason not to deviate he
makes is amazing you're not already
signed up there is a link under all of
my videos it's a referral link so i get
actual like money I need to sign up when
you click using my leg but you can also
just go to ebay.com and sign up it's
amazing i've been using it for years so
much money back I don't know how it even
works like I think it just has something
to do with maybe the brand's giving due
dates a cut or something I don't know
but pretty amazing hey girl with pearl
says BuzzFeed just posted a pale skin
product list includes foundations thank
you so much jen says make a minute is a
way to keep putting out content every
day that's very true too and it's not
it's not very time consuming so it works
out well and it gives you a good
information to everybody I think that's
the best part is it gives that automatic
new information so something awesome
comes out on Instagram you know we can
just throw it up that day instead of
have you wait to sunday so Paula says
try Lancome stick blows on a sauce and
Beverly Hills out of the water really
very interesting Joan says she finally
got a city without really that's
exciting and I'm gonna butcher your name
Haifa hey hey Missa hate bugs that
oh my oh my i'm actually wait for this
yeah i'm thought your wig too art says
watching one of your videos when I saw
this live love you in your videos thank
you so much hard I appreciate that our
art fanatic your name's not art you're
not fanatic name could be over 30 who
knows karen and karen says ebates tells
you all the deluxe sample
that's true and one that I've been
addicted to lately one of those things
you know Jericho to like really tell me
not for coupon codes I've been using
something called honey lately oh my gosh
it's amazing you have to download to
computer which is a little bit creepy
but i have a mac and i haven't had any
problems with downloading my computer is
called honey and what it does is it has
a little honey thing up in the corner
and when you shop on a website you click
the little honey button and it scans all
of those retailmenot codes so you don't
have to go and try every single one of
them it automatically find them all for
you and try them all I've saved a lot of
money that way and when you're in store
my favorite one to use is coupon Sherpa
love me some coupon Sherpa oh my
goodness it's a free app and you just go
to whatever store is that you're
shopping at it works really really well
for clothes shopping like I went to
justice and bought my daughter for fall
wardrobe because of course we know the
growing more clothes so I mean why I
gotta keep growing and then it got to
buy them all new clothes clothes on film
um but I saved like forty dollars at
justice because I use coupon Sherpa so
definitely recommend on that as well if
you want to if you want to uh to save
some money to sahaja says yes love honey
from extension to yes honey's amazing
Michelle excited too yeah i thought i
was like groundbreaking like i think i
think the only one they knew about it
but apparently there's a lot of yo they
know about honey church says i'm holding
up a black friday for the rock does
anyone know if they will have a sailor
ulta will I don't know yeah honey is
pretty amazing care and it's awesome
then it says I'm not rude to starting
the eighth Oh time at the UM the sale if
you type in like honey coupons or
something like that and in Google search
you should be able to find it or honey
coupon codes steph says justice as
expensive as heck it is compared to
target it is but i find the clothes last
better from justice than from target the
last are all year where I feel like some
of the target stuff will just completely
died on her and rip and then she gets
upset so we missed shot me adjust this
more than target because of that my son
he's shopping worked hard it because he
doesn't have a job
this equipment and then we just buy him
extra things from target which now that
I'm thinking about it logically i could
buy two hearted shirts for the price of
one just a shirt so really doesn't make
any sense to shop at justice my daughter
loves justice though she does uh-oh some
fish out of water i'm in china or what
your real name is I know your real name
though gents it's somewhere file to my
brain to remember since you mentioned
liking smaller indie brand you should
check out benevolent beauty box they
have a fab customer service so i'm
guessing me if they email you emailed
they'd send you a box or two you really
ought to try that you know i'm doing i'm
gonna do an etsy video i bought a bunch
of i just went on etsy and i picked some
random brands and i bought some stuff
off etsy and i'm going to do an etsy um
hopefully a full face etsy thing I don't
know if I'm be able to find foundation
that's the only thing I'm foundation
concealer things like that I did get a
face powder I got a blush I got a bunch
of eyeshadows I got some lip products
things like that from etsy to kind of
support some some other brands but I'm
kind of torn because there's one brand
that the product was not good at all
like it was it was not good so now it's
like what do I do now because this is
some woman i'm assuming he's neither
some woman that's sitting in her house
making these this product and it's
really not good so I'm nervous about
what do I say because I don't want to
trash this poor woman who's got this
brand but at the same time I give honest
reviews so should I give her a pass
because I don't know it's if I'm torn
I'm torn I should leave it out of the
review I don't know but then at the same
time then I'm not giving my subscribers
a heads up they may me to let them know
that this product doesn't work so they
don't buy it so I don't know I'm stuck
on that one morally I don't but simple
totally still totally done but a lot of
the other things that i bought are
really really good it's really just that
one that one product that it's just not
good for me mrs. says did you get the
pumpkin spice highlights I did not Rose
says um are you staying with FC I'm
getting so frustrated with them what's
your favorite sub box um Oh subtitle
worsens benevolent boxes all cruelty
free and a lot vegan mostly smaller
lesser known brands them I am going to
stay with FC I've been with FC
since december of their first year or
november no i think was november of
their first year i've been with them
forever I have no plans of stopping ypsi
anytime soon I don't review it every
single month because I'm not obligated
to wear with boxy charm I am obligated
to review what every month because they
do send it to me and I've been with dr.
Thompson's their second box ever their
first box I don't know if they were
promoting it but I got their second box
they sent to me so let the owner of boxy
charm and I we were just emailing back
and forth actually last night so I do
have to review about determinate don't
have to review FC so that's why you
don't always see it on the channel all
the time but I don't think that I'm
going on subscribe from Dempsey I feel
like I still get good things from it I
also make videos for them also i'm part
of the f cos community the creators that
are part of FC there's whole facebook
group and things like that and i like
being a part of the MCOs group there are
great people over there so i think i
don't know if you have to be subscribed
to FC to skate with that but i would
kind of feel weird not being subscribed
in subscription and being a part of the
group you know god so it's kind of like
my tank UFC for f cos f cos what
existing you know to say subscribe to
them so Shannon's leaving by treated
Julie says she loves boxy charm anna
says foxy tom is pretty good i
personally love boxy charm I Babji charm
is definitely my favorite um there's no
question about it i also get glossybox
you don't see lost about to the channel
because glossybox is not very good i got
on the deal for eight dollars for the
heroes aetiology box on groupon because
of game nicole who's our sale on CEOs
recorder she put it into the show that
groupon with Groupon no wasn't
livingsocial it wasn't MUFON but it was
one of those had this deal on glossybox
so I jumped on I got it but I wouldn't
have known about if it weren't for
what's a picnic so I got that for a year
so I began glossybox per year and I do
feel like it's worth the eight dollars a
month I think it's probably worth ten to
twelve dollars a month but I don't think
it's worth twenty one it doesn't come
close to baggage are not even
blows so she diary says I don't get
those I get get 4 get four catered to
women of color well I'm trying to figure
out what that means maybe subscription
boxes aren't catered to women of color
maybe Julie says I got the Oprah Beverly
Hills High later this month I mean
what's amazing yeah Oprah is really like
the guy who runs over his name is David
and he is extremely passionate about his
brand oh my goodness I've met him three
times so passionate oh my gosh that man
is all about his brand like he is just
all about it and he's very innovative he
comes up with his own ideas he's
extremely creative so yeah I mean I'm
not surprised that Oprah is doing well
with the man that's behind it he um he's
a very very strong passionate man carles
says the lip product that came in the
box of time this month was so gross I
never throw away products this one is so
sticky and you know I hadn't gone into
those products a whole lot yet because
I've just been I just had me putting on
makeup and I need to put anything more
because it's kind of my job do you wear
makeup every day and I've been slacking
haven't been doing my Rosie says I think
i'm going to unsub to the support play
box not not super impressed I was
subscribe to that for a little while and
then something happened my credit card
and unsubscribed to me unsubscribe me so
I'm not subscribed anymore she diary
says I get foxes more catered to women
of color what boxes do you get because
I'm sure there's other women of color
who would love to know Catherines going
to go get some coffee the gold digger
says GlossyBox deals on gilt city thank
you so much for that you remember nicole
says I want want to be over so bad I got
the temptu I got the temp 22 but you
know what I really like the temp too I
was surprised at how much I didn't like
it I think it's right here I got this in
my box each arm and it's great it's
wonderful so what I do is I just drip a
little bit on my arm my bronzer brush
and I just do a swipe and a swipe and
then i blend it in and it looks so
natural it looks amazing who shocked how
much I like this and there on there's a
little bit of shine it but not not very
much at all just it's just
or just a little bit of shine you mean
work like that I'm so surprised and then
Julie also says the Luxy brushes and
then the full-size heat protectant well
I know and that bullseye see protected
is amazing it is like being changing for
me and I don't really like 30 geo stuff
before previously when I got stuff I
haven't left like that I've got no hair
mask like multiple times does absolutely
nothing for me so in my brain like what
I try something from a Brandon I want
and it's like not good I kind of get
this bias in my head against the branch
so Bri oshio is what it was well my god
there comes another problem in from
prayers you know you know it's not going
too good total sinking game changer that
um what's a call it's in my bathroom I
don't know what it's called but I'll put
it in the description down below and
it's going to be in the review for
auction term when i get to to that
review but oh my gosh it's so good it's
like multiple products on when it's a
heat protectant cream and like it's
supposed to strengthen your hair and
call flyaways and like all kinds of
stuff oh my gosh so excited so it's just
a really really good product Shelby is
here hello Shelby other was a gin
question up here and I missed an awesome
dancing experience kathleenlights in
Alaska go saying she was going to take
break from comedy collapse which video
is that it is in her morphy video the
one where she talks about her morphy um
her morphe collaboration that she did
talked about she's gonna take a break
from flaps for a while Kathleen's done a
lot of collapse and she talks about it
very briefly about people are like oh
you do City collapse um but yeah so she
says in the video she's going to take a
break it's toward the end it's after the
swatches is when she talks about it I do
have it linked under what's a good
makeup it is linked they are the video
so if you want to check it out but down
with fast board passed the swatches and
you'll find it there I think she's
talking about the nail polish that's my
opinion that she's going to be doing
what some kind of nail polish on
something but I think that's very odd
happy female polishes what she's gone
maybe she's just going like this maybe
it means nothing I don't know I'm always
gotta figure things out I did meet
kathleen at generation hooey in New York
she was just this lives in person as she
is in her videos just I mean she's one
of the bigger youtubers that I still
respect she just seems like such a
sweetheart so um yeah I think that she's
genuinely Jenny I definitely believe
that in my heart that she is she just
seems like a really nice person some
fish out of water says for those bums to
not get the okra highlight you can get a
pan of either the dupe that highlights
for under fifteen dollars you think one
is fab for fair skin great thank you so
much Julie says Alexa for a play but
usually have a stuff they send so you
already have those kinds of things got
it cocoa tea she diary says is a great
and omnibot ani box like onyx ani box so
Coco teak misses you to the oven

love to ship internationally maybe one
day christmas has anyone tried to make a
V pilot yet I have not Ord love you know
if the collective brain has danny wants
know is brought to term better than FC i
believe so it's also twice as expensive
though it's 21 dollars a month since sep
10 but i feel like you get you get full
sizes goat of samples and i personally i
love it i really enjoyed it I don't feel
like the brand ranges is big with dr.
charm I feel like they repeat brands
more often then if she does but it's
sizes and it's a lot of really good
stuff like that the odd chef and or what
it's in a lot more like smaller brands
you get some bigger brands sometimes
definitely and you also get some smaller
brands so like for example hold on hold
on where's this video me I'm looking for
the studio makeup palette on here is I
have to i'm just going to do some finger
swatches in this thing we're getting
another one of these this month
according to a spoiler but i'm just
gonna do finger swatches but these are
true amazingness using the lighter
shades I thought I should've done some
of the deeper shades okay uh-huh we did
some of the other ones because some of
these are amazing this bronzy 10 and the
wolf with Lobos these lighter ones are
not showing up much on my hand but they
blend really nicely on the I so but yeah
so this was in the box of charm they say
it's a fifty-dollar palette i don't know
if i would pay fifty dollars for it but
it's definitely $35 palette it's good
it's really good lasting power is a

right hey fuh okay good that's it well
that's phonetic so that helps me is that
it's like English phonetics oh that was
coming up for me awesome i'm glad I said
it but there's the one person that I had
trouble with every single week and she's
not here and I couldn't happen I think I
might have scared her way because I give
her too much attention for Sandra name
wrong are there ever any conferences in
Chicago I know Jim he's trying to go to
Chicago least I think I pretty sure that
was where they said they were trying to
go with Chicago that girl with curls I'm
Jen could you do skin care reviews
drugstore and prestige or skin tools
like clarisonic this is my thing with
skin care reviews why I don't need them
very often um my thing is is that I feel
like with skincare you really to try it
for a long period of time in order for
to be able to see results so I make up
with you is you can do like this because
it either works or doesn't use it for
too long in the carry time I try to do
like the week but stink it's so long to
review you know so it's like I can't
even it would it's just not logical for
me to do a ton of skincare reviews
because it would just take so stinkin
long to review it I do have a new
skincare brand that i'm going to try if
I can never get my high mirror to work
so if you don't know about the honey or
you can move on what honey mirror is I
don't want to go into too much of it
here he's mia needs a couple of weeks
ago and i do have one but we're having
some technical difficulties and we will
be able to get sorted out tomorrow i
know there will be a review on the
channel behind mirror eventually but i
wanted to wait to start the skincare
routine until after I got my hi mera
working because they can kind of go
together in review so I do have a new
skin care video that would be doing but
I don't know if I can do drugstore and
prestige because it said it would take
so long to form thoughts on it it would
look like once came here review a year
no not one but like me I could you maybe
for a year at the most Jackie wants to
know if I'm dressing up tomorrow yes and
you could see my costume and what's a
good makeup that's what I I'm wearing
this year is my Greek goddess costume
because Lila is a Greek goddess and she
asked me to dress up with her so Oh
fascias FISA FISA FISA wisely is here
buys I did I get it right
I'm your gin I'll never let it go oh i
love you i love you FISA I think I said
it right this time though some cansado
water says skin care reviews can't say
where people review without really using
am curious to hear about that mirror
though yeah definitely FISA has been
here I how did i miss you all right um
let's see Levine I'm gonna say luck love
Heat I can't do it for too many vowels
Levine levante what are your thoughts on
the release of the swamp swamp King
Khalid it is that common in the industry
very release I think it's becoming more
common especially with you the influence
or palettes cuz it sell out I think it's
smart of tart to rerelease it because
it's sold out very very quickly and they
have the opportunity make a lot more
money with that palette that was a
decent palette I really enjoyed i'ma get
it I really enjoyed this how I do have a
full review on that if you want to see
my full review on it but I did like it I
did like it a lot I mean this one's done
a lot of glitter falling out the cheek
products are really good and really fun
and it smells good it smells very
vanilla e which i think is very unfun so
I really like that and i love it says
believe in yourself love yourself
embrace your individuality on the top
it's like such as good mark but anyway i
do real i definitely like this but i do
have a forward you if you want to see
swatches and look and all of that stuff
I don't have two swatches that video but
there is a look I know that lovey and
LaVon de la vie en rose ok love the end
love the end I got it I got it okay all
right Angela says L may has eye color
specific Khaled's can't touch a couch
for quality huh good to know Trish just
got here I'm glad that you're here Julie
says I honestly didn't care for mine and
gave it away the swamp we'd really Julie
I'm surprised this is actually was my
favorite to our palette that I've gotten
so far Denise says she returned first Oh
No jenna says I'm a bartender so I could
do anything for how we we probably make
more in tips yeah definitely makes you
totally wear what I want to wait
tables I always dress up when I was
allowed Kathryn likes her swapping huh
I'm like mine oh my good luck he is the
best palate I've ever all fought no but
it's good i like it Timmy says I already
dressed up I was a dear we had our
halloween parade on Friday I'm a teacher
but I'm in Mexico sir trick-or-treating
isn't only a thing here except some some
something we'll do a trick do trick or
treating you know what that means but
yeah okay well I'm glad to dress up and
in dere costumes I've seen this year are
really really cute I bet it was adorable
Rosie says she never reaches for her
swamp cream Lynn says so what's with all
the complaints from customers who seem
to have any cosmetics from QVC company
policy issue whew I haven't heard that
one that's new to me Lynn half-empty
products from KBC one it's all knowing
about them it is fun to chat with other
makeup addicts isn't it so fun mount
mouthy good morning flurry good to see
you I'm a teacher and costumes are
banned from your school boy that's so
sad Julie says try the target art
tartlet and boom that's the one
everybody tells me is very good i don't
know i didn't care of us trying it like
swamp eating or maybe i'm like in my
home here for the swamp food thing maybe
you shouldn't get it because the
community is saying that don't get
except for capra happen me and you me
and you some is out of waters as I wish
to baste heart etching with the wick
wick I wish to face tart were put out
fewer holiday releases with better
quality I would respect that so much
more agreed agreed but the thing is is
they just want this is amazing as a
business person says I'm glad I didn't
get a lot I didn't get a lot of flats
all they were just ok yourself who said
it he could I don't know I mean like I
know what my favorite collab was and
this is nothing to do with Manny anyway
nothing to do with him as an individual
person but I got excuse me only with his
of my voice per second I got the liquid
lipstick lab of nanny and okra and man
are those lipsticks some of my favorite
liquid lipsticks of all time those
shades are gorgeous gorgeous and
Tony that's probably my favorite cloud
that I've ever purchased I know it is I
knew that's my favorite 5 i've ever
purchased was that liquid lipstick set
amazing and i own a quite a few flabs um
but yeah i would choose that i have a
jacket hope that good thing I got that
some of the Kathleen like stuff from
colour-pop I've got the Nikki tutorials
palette about the swamp clean palette so
I have quite a few things but that
liquid lipstick set it's good that's
really good devorah says I have so many
neutrals in the Urban Decay electric
palette but I just still one that Judy's
place mini masquerade go for it
girlfriend it's good they're really fun
it's a fun formula it's a unique formula
I really like it a lot some cash adder
water says I know its business but it
seems like the longer they make much
more money at the quality is better no
hay and and this is the thing is I feel
like sometimes brands lose track of that
at how important brand loyalty is at
least i think the brain loyalty is
really important I don't know if
number-wise brand loyalty is very
important but I feel like if you
consistently put out good product that's
why I think to face is where they are
today is because they were consistently
putting out good products I mean you
think about you know when when they were
putting out the chocolate bar palette me
um you know the the bronzer people were
dying over the foundation you know I
guess some people didn't but I don't
know i just went to face was a brand a
lot of people really respected for their
consistent quality and now i feel like
it's time for me to fall back a little
bit and I'm kind of sound about that I'm
saving with kat von d I feel like half
on he's released two really big mrs. and
it makes me sad because I feel like you
know there's no reason for kat von d to
release mrs. I mean she's an artist who
is like when your tattoo us my husband's
a type two artists your tattoo artist
details matter those little tiny lines
every one of them you do matters and I
felt like that was where cat was as far
as her makeup was that you know every
little detail matters and I still feel
like she wants to be like that but I
feel like corporate kind of sometimes
pushes her in the direction that she
shouldn't be going what she's breaking
away
from the Sephora brand I it feels like
and I don't know if she is completely
but it seems like she's kind of trying
to do more of her own thing and less
with Sephora um I don't know imagine
that big blush miss and then she had the
holiday cow two years ago was really bad
this in my opinion and I don't know I
just uh I don't have brand loyalty to
anybody 100% anyone makes me sad because
I feel like they've all over these
things that are just me you know Krista
says I'm done with two facing toward
their products don't excite me at all
who quality is so so tart I find better
luck with but I love their eyeliners
towards islanders are really really good
I love the new shape tape he's amazing
Cheyenne says the auto sales about lee
holds ultimate locality it was horrible
reviews but i like it i saw shimon had a
really terrible review so i didn't get
it because I sound bad with you but i
love the original globe hit the uh
excuse me the one that don't they won't
come out not that long though I don't
know where it is it's very oh I got the
green one and i really like it a lot
it's amazing this is the one I recommend
for our holiday if you can find this but
not on a website anymore oh it's eleven
o'clock okay well just go I'm Shelby
does anyone know when the modern
renaissance way back in stock I don't
know him two percent Abby says I only
have one to face the biggest nay and i
love that have great things about it
maybe i'll get some chocolate bars but
I'm yeah I'm getting a bit deterred from
them everyone's saying qualities
gallantly well the but the original
chocolate bar palette is still really
good it is which brands are more
positively consistent none of them none
of them not a mark that's why they need
to hire me to be a brand consultant
that's what I would love to do I would
love to do brand consultant I would love
to be part of the testing process for
brands when they're when they're trying
out a new product before they release
when they would send it to me and I
would try it and I would give them per
ticket it before it's released that way
you dream job I would like that more
than doing my own makeup products to be
a integral part of product development
for other brand
that is a dream job that would be music
