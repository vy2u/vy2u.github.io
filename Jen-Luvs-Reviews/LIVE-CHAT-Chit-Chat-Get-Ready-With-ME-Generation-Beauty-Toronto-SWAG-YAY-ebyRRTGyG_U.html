what to the make-up chat I do want to
apologize I can't find my microphone I
did some cleaning before I left and
apparently I cleaned my microphone too
well because I can't find it so I
apologize for the sound ahead of time
welcome to the woods of a makeup chat it
is so good to be back we just got back
from Canada we went to well first went
to New York City and we went to go see
School of Rock which was amazing and we
did touristy stuff and then we went to
Niagara Falls and that was amazing
and then we went to Toronto and did some
things in Toronto and which Toronto
generation Beauty which is part of the
reason of what I plan to do today was
because of Toronto GEB beauty and then
after that we spent some time in
Montreal which is amazing oh my goodness
it was fabulous so thank you Canada for
having us happy Canada today one daily
so a generation Beauty if you don't know
what generation Beauty is it is a
get-together of YouTube makeup lovers so
people that watch YouTube videos people
that make youtube videos it's just a way
for everybody to kind of gather together
and meet brands and get products and
things like that so even if you ago as
an attendee like someone who doesn't
make videos you still leave with bags of
stuff I heard the swag bags were amazing
for the attendees that they were almost
as good as what we got at the Creator
cocktail party which is where we get a
giant bag we got this bag here and it
was about 3/4 of the way full with
goodies I did do a livestream on my
facebook if you're not following me on
facebook my facebook is jen w u IM it's
a person account rather than like a like
a creator account like a business
account or whatever because i didn't
like the business account setup at all
so if you just follow me over there you
should be able to see the livestream of
everything that i got i think there's
some other videos out of what was in the
generation to describe but if you want
to check that out but we're just gonna
be playing with some of the stuff that
will create a full things i've got
almost a full fix almost but before we
do that i am going to say hello to the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
also known as the beautiful wonderful
people that are in the live
chat right now I call them the
collective brainy because we work
together to solve problems and save
money together and someone spend money
together on things so that's part of why
we're here so the people in the
collective brain are gonna be
participating in this chat so if you
don't like me talking to what seems to
be invisible people this may not be the
best video of mine for you to start with
I do have lots of other content on the
channel right where I don't talk to the
collective brain but you're interested
in hearing not just my opinion but the
opinion of a couple hundred people then
you are definitely in the right place so
before we go into some of the things
that I got I do want to say hello to
some of the people that are here I'm
going to go ahead and scroll all the way
up to the top to the first people who
arrive so little hammer oh five is here
good morning to you latina is here Julio
and Latina in the house
Julio down by the schoolyard I heard
that song where were we I forget where
it was we heard that song and I was like
I was like I was thinking about you only
by Amanda it's here she says the victim
was considered you staying in bed longer
but realized it was Chad today and had
to get up immediately to get my coffee
ready oh I'm so glad that you made with
Amanda Malory Lynn is here amber is here
good morning to you she said glad you
got to experience Toronto maggot Falls
Niagara Falls was amazing that was
really cool we spent way too much that
trip because we had never been and I
found out my husband had saved up a
little bit for us to do some travel
stuff this summer so he kind of
surprised me with some extra activities
so we actually got to ride in a
helicopter over and I had four Falls
which was epic we did like one of those
package tours where you got to do like
lots of different falls things it was
amazing I was terrified don't helicopter
I was holding on to my daughters but it
was amazing I loved it Stacey says good
morning Jen glad you're back Sunday
morning coffee and Jen loves make up
minute and Jen lows live great morning
yay Mary's here good morning to you and
Karen is here Amber's here and lunch at
his back to Tabitha
is here got the swag in the bag good
morning I got something for Tabitha - I
showed her already
a gold-digger is here Elise is here and
Gwen is here and Liz in Cheyenne and
Chelsea and if I did not say hello to
you good morning to you thank you for
being here I wish I could say hello to
everybody but it just took way too long
kindiy get some coffee yes go get some
coffee
I'll talk loud so that you can hear me
as you go get coffee husband says love
your vacation snaps it was I'm I'm glad
to be back on snapchat I'm Jen loves
reviews everywhere if you ever want to
follow me anywhere first thing we got
was a little mini photo finish Smashbox
primer I will tell you that the swag at
this one it's rano gem beauty wasn't
quite as epic as let's say the Los
Angeles for the New York it was at least
for me it was good like there was lots
of good stuff I'm extremely thankful but
it wasn't quite as epic like for example
Smashbox they gave the little mini photo
finish primer some people ended up
getting some more from Smashbox but this
was all I was able to try for Smashbox
announced oh wait no there's one more
thing for Smashbox to show you it
actually is quite epic never mind that
wasn't a swag bag but at the actual
event they just gave the little tiny
primary initially they give a bigger
things but that's okay I'm still very
thankful I don't you think I'm not
thankful but it was kind of like oh I
was kind of hoping to get something like
one of their new products you know
because I want to try things for review
for the channel for you and you know
this has been out for a while and you
know we get it it's free samples and
things so we're gonna use this as our
primer today I do like the Smashbox
photo finish primer it is a very
silicone which means it's very smooth
and it makes the skin feel very nice at
least for me but there are definitely
people that do not enjoy silicone
primers so if you are one of those
people that don't like I'm just gonna
get the tiniest little bit more for my
for guys if you are one of those people
that don't like silicone primers and
we're not gonna like the Smashbox if you
can ever happen to try it they do give
out samples
olá though so you probably tried it if
you've ordered online from from any of
the nature of beauty retailers Aspen
says so Smashbox primer everyone gives
that out I have like 20 samples and
can't use it on my skin wish it and you
have been able to get something unique I
did get one thing really really nice
from Smashbox but he was in the swag bag
it wasn't the actual guy so yeah so
there we go
this is a really interesting product
this is Bob pur Lisse and they gave this
to me on the concierge toured because
the air stores are for YouTube creators
and what if she does is they they get
some of their creators and you can sign
up for these tours where they have
someone from FC takes you around to the
different brands just like anywhere from
like three to six people in a group and
you go and you get to meet the brand you
going with the rep from the brand new
exchanged business cards sometimes they
give you extra products things like that
so I've noticed that they had BB cream
up here Elise and I had no idea that
your lease may be decrease because
they're technically there are typically
a skincare brands out to try their face
masks and moisturizers or something like
that they're a nice brand but I think
they weren't dabbling in makeup so it's
really exciting to see this I've used
this four or five times I've used this a
lot while I was gone is actually
replaced the things that I thought you
really liked it a lot I was so surprised
and how much I liked it it kind of
reminds me of the Garnier BB cream here
the Garnier BB cream a little bit you
guys know that one or the UM it's a
little bit thicker than the Garnier
though it's a little bit more I think a
little bit more mouth no maybe not a
little more it's about the same coverage
as the garnet I guess but I really like
it the lasting power was good it wasn't
fantastic I mean it's a BB cream you
don't really expect it to help with a
huge long lasting power but I really
like it a lot so the coverage is nice BB
cream I'm surprised I was expecting more
of like a tinted moisturizer especially
plum pur Lisse being such a big skincare
brand put that aside and bland Oh Teresa
has to leave okay
bye Teresa have a good dinner we're
through you are close should have picked
a different blending tool because I feel
like this one kind of eats product a bit
but it's just a really nice light to
medium coverage you can build it up to
medium it definitely will not get
further than medium I guess it can work
like a leg to me you know it doesn't
really get to like solid lead
but it just gives me organized to the
coverage in case you missed it the BB
cream that I'm using is by pur Lisse and
this is the shade light I think they
only had three skin tones and my friend
branding she tried it was a brandy
brandy yeah was brandy that I was
walking around with there were a couple
girls with deep skin tone that we're
trying in and it looked really nice on
her Brandy's a little bit deeper and she
tried it on her and it's too light for
her so if you're like a lighter deep the
dark will probably work for you but if
you're a deeper deep it might not I have
linked to Brandy's channel down
underneath this video so you can see
what her skin tone is the dark was not
dark enough for her and she's not super
dark but she's darker than the other
girls that work not true so just so you
know they only make the three shape but
the light is perfect for me so if you're
lighter than me the light might be too
dark for you okay so you can see it's
just a little bit of coverage I'm not
gonna take it up because I'm just
spending time in my house today so you
find a place to put the things I've
already used a little room on this table
alright next up is something that I
actually purchased Aspen says that
purely 6:24 on your skin thank you so
much
the benefit boying airbrush concealer I
purchased this this cost $20 Canadian I
don't know how much it is American but I
do know that our USD whatever you want
to call it but I do know it was on
discount there I've used it a few times
and I'm honestly not very impressed so
far but I'm still trying to play with it
and figure it out like I thought I must
be losing it wrong because it's just not
there's no old fees I would send Jenna's
like flawless skin so everything was
good on oh thank you and that's I think
part of the problem with this concealer
is that I don't have blemishes and a lot
of discoloration but like I'll put it on
my hands here let me put it on this
freckle here this is my tester Trevor so
we'll put it on my hand here and you can
see at full opacity it covers it but as
soon as you start blending it out I
don't know if you can see but it's
definitely shining through so yeah
having having not problem skin is a
blessing and a curse being a youtuber
viewer but it just the
the concealer just doesn't seem like it
has enough on to it and by the way I was
kind of ballsy and I asked the chicken
benefit and I fell bad because I don't
know if I phrased it right this things
up sometimes just don't come out the way
that I expect them to and she gave me
this look like but okay so when I asked
her I said you know I don't know maybe I
was rude I don't know I wasn't trying to
be rude it just kind of came out that
way so basically I'll be honest with you
what I said so what I was wondering was
boy what is the deal with boy because
boy I didn't say this specifically but I
was a point in my head I'm thinking one
means nothing look what it what even is
born like why didn't they mean
everything this is what I said why
didn't they choose erase paste instead
of boring for the new line why did they
get rid of a race face because a race
pace trying to find a concealer brush a
race pace makes sense it erases things
it's it's a concealer and it's erase
paste but they got rid of erase place
I'm just gonna use this brush they got
rid of a ring no you know what I means
my finger I'm like going back and forth
they got rid of the name erased pace for
boy and it just didn't make sense to me
what is going on with this company why
would they do that
and a race pace is such an iconic
product if you don't know I'm going a
little fast if you don't know um benefit
change the name of all of their
concealers too boring and then they
change them so they took like the erase
paste that leg is really really popular
and they changed it to like bling
intense or somebody that's a bang
industrial-strength I think is what it's
called when you're industrial-strength
so the race pace is blowing brightening
I thought it was boring I thought it was
the industrial-strength anyway they have
it on their website what is what and you
can find pictures of what exactly is
what I nobody featured it in the news at
one point so so yes I was wondering what
the world did they do like the fake up
they change to something else it's like
Duane hydrating so mizzen was the answer
she said well this is what they were
they were the logic was they just like
the sound Boing and they're saying well
it's kind of like all of your you know
Flemish Azhar going off your skin and
dark circles are blowing him off your
skin like almost like that the product
will make any of your flaws bounce off
of your skin
that was the that was the whatever that
was the the logic behind it so so okay
that makes sense cool thank you so much
for that but I felt the same I had I
wish they change it to a race face and
never heard mixed reviews of people in
there think their thoughts about the
packaging - I like it I think it's cute
it's very benefitting you know it's very
cute when they erase paste I thought it
didn't really fit their current theme
with the purple and everything so this
more fits their be my guest
AJ says I don't I really don't love the
new product name from benefit yeah
and Bay Beach Beauty says old names make
more sense yeah Alexander says to me
Boing could be referring to the way your
skin will look it will be firm and fun
yeah and kind of bounce kind of thing
yeah Megan says she's freaking out when
she heard that the array space was like
on sale like worrying that it was gonna
be bought but they just repackaged
everything okay so moving on I just
realized I don't have any kind of
setting powder so I'm gonna go get a
setting powder this is not really for
setting but you know we'll do it so we
obviously need my Laura Mercier setting
powder because I don't have one and I
really do feel like somebody's calling
me right now that is okay
it's probably um telemarketer I've even
lost its home marketer calls lately so
Oh
setting powder yeah I didn't get any
setting powder so I let the Laura Bush
they said cover a lot by the way
oh and then the concealer I feel like I
definitely need this set because I feel
like it looks chunky if I don't set it I
don't know I just don't I don't really
like the finish of it very much so far
but again I'm still playing with it I
think it might be operator error
it just has to be better than this it
has to be I'm not doing off yet not
giving up yet
those girls didn't either my
eyebrows down oh and reduce noise have
no brow products in here so we're just
gonna use something else cool bro we're
gonna use a the NYX contour palette for
brows okay so let me go ahead what are
you gonna do next let's do let's do
brows so they also gave us the NYX
highlight and contour pro palette and I
did use this some while I was away and I
did enjoy it very much
I love NYX contour products I've been
really enjoying them I feel like they
compared to my high-end I don't feel
like that they last necessarily as long
as let's say my Anasazi or my Kat Von D
eat well no that's what the same as a
Kat Von D but they're I think we oughta
stop you laughs a little bit longer but
overall I really like me it's contour
products I like this one especially
because it has two cooler tones and then
two warmer tones so if you prefer water
of the other you have it you also have
this buttery yellow matte which is nice
and then you've got a shimmering
highlight here and I think this is a
matte that's like one and then this
one's got a little bit of satiny finish
to it but it's very very very subtle oh
yeah we were doing brows weren't you
doing contour I'm not looking for a
contour brush
I saw them unpacked everything so I'm
missing some of my staples okay I'm just
going to use this contour shade right
here for my brows the dark contour so
how's everybody doing we can use them to
keep looking at that next palette I like
it so far and if you don't have anything
like it I would definitely recommend it
it's not anything magical or epic but it
works but multi-purpose multi-piece you
don't necessarily need a brow powder you
know lots of eyeshadows contour pellets
can work for brow powders
all right it's a little bit light for my
brows but we're just gonna go with it
just gonna go with it
Oh Heather it's here thought up early
she's in California oh my gosh well I am
honored that you want to spend your
morning with me yeah this is Stephanie
so that is that no eyeshadow primer but
we did get something I'm not going to
use because it's gonna be for giveaway
oh here it is
I already own this so it's gonna be
forgiven a they gave us a naked feet
palette at the Creator day which creator
day is an invite-only like seminar kind
of thing where they have panels and
things and you can network with other
Creators and things and its really
really cool the Urban Decay was there
they weren't at the actual event but
they were a creator day and they gave
everybody created a a maybe feet house I
thought was amazing so this is actually
gonna go and give away I am going to be
doing a giveaway for 10 million views
which should be coming up late summer
early fall so this is gonna be part of
it it will be a requirement visit
usually but it will be a requirement
that you are subscribed to the channel
in order to win the game way up probably
gonna split it into two I haven't laid
it out what yet but this is definitely
gonna be going in a giveaway that you're
gonna put it in here this is where I
kind of keep my stuff for giveaway
that's gonna go in there so I thought
about doing a shadow today with the
naked heat but I just did a video on
that and that's kind of what so singing
about doing a look with the wild and
alluring palette which is by BH
Cosmetics
I just got actually no one here I don't
know this is what we'll do this is what
we'll do because what I'm trying to
match my shirt but then like this was
kind of irrelevant like a year old so
maybe we'll do the BH Cosmetics solar
flare palette
doesn't match my shirt you think you
guys can handle the fact I look isn't
gonna match my shirt I think that you
guys can and I'm hoping that the people
on the replay can because those are
people I really worried about that
you're not gonna be okay
oh you send you so let's get on there
palmist
oh I'll do that the solar flare palette
is BH Cosmetics version of the naked
heat style so this is what it looks like
and i swatched it I'm gonna put up a
swatch video on Instagram I just did a
swatch video on this on Instagram but
I'm going to do a swatch video on this
one so far
I did a look last night just playing and
they seem to be beautiful when they
first go on and then they seem to be
muddying together but again I'm still
playing with it so we're gonna go ahead
and play with the Solar Flare palette I
just thought it when I got back so I
didn't get it ad generation beauty but I
didn't get any eyeshadow palette except
for the naked heat and I just did a look
at that in a video so it's kind of like
my Sarah says I actually love those let
me hear oh thank you I think this
American Eagle last year this palette I
brought with me on on the trip and I
love it it's the first palette from
Tarte that I can say I actually really
loved which is odd because it is a very
boring setup of a palette but if you
don't own anything like this I
definitely recognize okay so I'm gonna
use let's just use journey up in the
crease I'm not gonna use any eyeshadow
primer today well I don't know maybe I
should I should because I'm so I'm just
going to use Urban Decay's anti-aging
primer potion Oh Stacy says my eyelids
don't have too much moisture at all
thank you she's I could use my creative
energy in will be amazing it's
definitely not gonna match my Tara Tara
says she loves me I love you to you I
don't know you but I'm feeling that I
love you the necessary that we'll never
have much luck with big shadow you know
what I really like BH Cosmetics big
shadows they're one of the only
that I really like ugh Beach cosmetics
and I like the products from not warmer
say Laura Geller Laura Geller makes
really good baked products yeah those
are the two brands that I really feel
like have you count on for good solid
baked products just ordered the toilet
the Tarte palette Thanks oh I hope you
like it oh you say you push that she
says just ordered the Tarte palette
thanks to Jen
oh you just ordered it sorry I'm going
slow um yeah I hope you love it as much
as I do I think it's fabulous Harvard
says running to all today to get the new
Carli bybel palette so anyone have it I
have the I had the old one and I just
wasn't using it so I declared it all
right let me go ahead and get this I
look down yeah so this by the way is a
color pop brush which I'm surprised how
much I like these colors pop brushes ty
says I'd never think about matching my
makeup to my clothing I also don't think
about four versus four looks and so on I
think about in the box because I get
pretty for it oh my gosh one time I got
torn apart for this look that I did it
was bad though it was it just didn't
match
I had like a bright pink lip with like a
purple eye it was a warm pink lip with a
cool purple eye and man the comments
were brutal on that video all right
we're just gonna do the transition from
the tart and let's just go for it
so with this should you use this brush
okay so the most beautiful shade I feel
like didn't hear is spectrum when you
swatch this one for you it's a beautiful
sub sunshine kind of shift you can see
that but it's beautiful yes thank you
so it's really pretty I don't know if
you can see the ship there but it's like
got this beautiful like peach to bold
shift and I know you love it so let's do
mmm you know what maybe it will do a
little bit of pinks and purples will
kind of stick to this row right here so
I'm gonna go ahead and put this shade
energy in the center and it does pick up
all these brushes very very well we're
just gonna kind of plant and you gotta
remember right now on bh cosmetics
website I think this is $10 so it's a
very inexpensive product and I kind of
feel like for someone like this if you
end up with four shades out of the
entire palette that you absolutely love
you are getting the money's worth you
know anything so even if there are some
duds in it I feel like it's worth it but
it's not a beautiful shine to it you see
that look where you can see it okay so
now I'm gonna go into this shape here
it's called hope no I think that was
called energy
this one's called for and I'm gonna put
that in the inner corner little button
up here but they're kind of muddying
together a bit which is odd because the
colors are very very different
I just don't want them getting the
separation of color I want I don't know
what I'm saying that I feel like it's it
is working better than I thought it was
all right I'm gonna take my fingertip
and kind of Pat it a little bit you can
also use a sponge tip applicator which
can come up with pigmentation but
there's something about using a sponge
tip applicator if they don't like I
think that it's the fact that they don't
bend very easily that I don't want all
right I'm gonna go into a zone for the
outer corner Meghan says I want the BH
Cosmetics foil eye palette you know I
haven't seen that I can't picture what
that looks like I'm sure I've seen it
like that picture looks like I'm gonna
do this like Neapolitan ice cream who
found the only gonna have to do that
service shave again because it's kind of
disappearing
there we go okay so now I'm gonna use my
fingertip and kind of pass that energy
shade just a little bit more in the
center hit the dark shade overpowering
it pretty much kind of got rid of it
there we go
you can also use these wet as well I use
the wet last night and they work really
well wet mm-hm
so that'll work I don't mind too crazy
today I'm just like doing stuff at the
filming today alright so the next thing
that I did which was really fun last
night is I use this shade right here
it's called gamma ray I use it as an
eyeliner and I really liked it so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how that
looks
I'm just gonna use this brow brush
doesn't want to be kind of fit so you
can see it but it's really really
pigmented it's probably the most
pigmented in the palette is purple and
it is a true purple I want it to be kind
of thick because we do have a black
eyeliner I want to lay over it but let
me show you the pigmentation on it this
one is really really nice and it stays
true purple where a lot of Purple's will
shift to black this one are gray and I
feel like this one holds on to more
purple into the pool it does have a
little bit of gray undertone but it's
not so bad
just a little bit of purple there so
just you know fun Rihanna says what's
the best the H Cosmetics palette you've
tried I'm really I really still love my
galaxy shrink palette this one I feel
like isn't quite as good at the galaxy
chic the Carli bybel palette was really
really good I just use it have so many
shades like that you second-guess
reminding us to use Ebates for 5% cash
back nice they are having a sale right
now at BH Cosmetics I think it's um I
forget what the percent off is but it is
a sale for um for a 4th of July alright
so I'm gonna go ahead and bust into the
eyeliner this is from essence that I see
scammers it's called the rockin doll duo
stylist eyeliner pen it is a ball tip
and I'm not the biggest fan of the ball
tip eyeliner as I find them difficult to
use but we're gonna go with it anyway
and do it will scared do stylist I'm
wondering what the duo part is mmm just
gonna roll with it
I tried the Revlon version of this and
it was very difficult to it's not it's
not in my heart like the wings not in my
heart today Alex says I need a new
eyeshadow blending brush that's very
fluffy any recommendations is that all
you need is a blending brush because
blending brushes
always tend to come in those kits and
the kits are really nice to have a bunch
of different brushes like for example
the I really like beauty junkies you can
get
on Amazon I know it seems come here to
buy like makeup stuff from Amazon at
least from me like like it mic like if
it's not from like a brand you
recognized and may feel like forget it
gonna get something cheap but beauty
junkies is overly great brand I'm
actually starting to put some beauty
junkies brushes in epsy bags which I'm
very excited to see because they really
are a good brand
they have kicks from really really cheap
they're uh exact dupes in my opinion for
Sigma brushes that's my opinion I did
hear that there was a period in time
where something as brushes were falling
apart but I haven't heard that in a long
time and I was cept them for review a
really long time ago it wasn't a plague
review but they did send it to me and I
was insanely fast they do a video about
that mommy says where did you get that
coffee mug my husband would love it love
your videos all thank you mommy loves
you all that's cute I got it I got los
angeles i guess i get this well gosh
about ten years ago was a long time ago
so i don't know if they still make them
or not yeah first impression of this
it's very very black and it went on
really easily so we'll have to see how
that goes
alright for mascara kagra girl was there
and they gave us the new total tease
mascara which looked really gonna be but
we'll see how it goes the beauty says I
love dotting my island I got the Loreal
one because they marketed the product
that way and it was awful the one thing
the liner claimed to do dot didn't work
at all well let's try to dock here if it
don't work I'm just going to try it on
my hand but some people do do that they
do like the little dots and then they
connect the dots pretty one now I
thought I want to add dots just for you
I'll put some dots on my face it does
pretty well I don't know if that looks
good or not but it worked
it totally works so just so you know and
assets is ready chief - so let's go
ahead
Oh update on the Wonder Woman brushes
the Wonder Woman brushes I do like them
very much but they are typical Luxy
brushes you're not gonna get in my
opinion I don't think that the brushes
are any higher quality than their
regular brushes what you're paying for
is the handle the packaging the
affiliation with Wonder Woman the mirror
is amazing in my opinion I saw some
people didn't like the New York I love
the mirror so that's what you're paying
the extra for is all of that and there
are blue brushes I love lucky brushes
but I don't see them being anything more
magical than that the dots are cute
Harry said oh good so alright so now
we're gonna go ahead and try this I'm a
little scared of this I don't even know
what I'm doing with this I better leave
like the directions on this what's the
deal with this how am I supposed to
apply this like it like going at it like
I know what I'm doing okay so let's see
full longer find section blah blah blah
easy breezy tip use the teeth the teaser
comes especially designed for precise
corner-to-corner separation remains easy
soap and water of knowledge test it
signal for contact lens wearers so
basically it just says use the teaser
coatings specifically designed for
precise corner point application but
doesn't give you a specific way to use
this viewer crazy thing you got going on
here so which them to port them it's
definitely a thinner formula it is
coloring my lashes it is not clunky in
any way it is not give any volume it is
giving me a tad bit of lip let's try
this little weird comic thing for a year
mazi it's a playsuit animal I definitely
not a volumizing mascara it gives a very
soft look to the lashes it's suddenly
not clumpy or thick or heavy in any way
think it says mascara but it's like a
torture device it does kind of look like
that so let me see I'm going to pull
this up a little bit so I can see
myself I don't know if you guys can see
the chart pull up a little bit and see
if you can see it's definitely not an
epic application on the first coat
definitely not but you can see I'd like
nothing laughs so I don't know so I
don't know I don't know heavy so she's
got your eyes out with it it's really
not bad it's just weird it's just weird
it's got like you see it's got smaller
little cookies on the top and bigger and
more separated Kofi's on the side but
it's a very light wet mascara so there
it really doesn't do anything like as
far as like the thickening oh there we
go getting some length now oh hello
second coat I am surprised
okay we've got some clapping now the
clumping is happening the clumping is
real
whoa whoa but we're gonna do some good
length and good morning you see if I can
get this hump out okay there we go
whoo I like it now oh I like now second
coat certain coating my friend and get
back up close try to get a little higher
do you think last time I wasn't high
enough I don't know if you can see the
difference but that is a big difference
I like it I like it a lot
very nice very nice I don't know if you
can see the difference but it's good
it's good second coat definitely makes a
huge difference
Sarah says she got heard the target but
multiplier has it and ball three
that's good to know but yes that is much
better
oh well very much better and sometimes I
feel like the mess here takes a little
bit of time to get on your lashes I mean
on the lashes on the brush
that's a nice mascara I'm surprised
because you know what I don't typically
what clever girl mascara Oh see this is
a very pleasant surprise I like the sole
a she was not impressed but another
covergirl my stairs in the past not
impressed
so one coat is very light it's still
very light but then that second coat
will definitely give you what weeks it's
giving me I can't give you but it's
giving me a lot it's a little heavier
given parity says cringe connect the
dots no I like the dots I'm having fun
with the dots the dots are supposed to
be fine enough I don't have to connect
the dots why can't I just have ducks
we're just having fun it's just makeup
well they even have the dots but we do
love you she leaves with such nice
comments dot it's gonna cost tsumuji
because it's not a pretty it's not
really doesn't look great all right very
good I like it I like it all right next
up we're gonna go into cheeks so sherry
likes my dots too have you ever just
having fun with this play so hopefully
you don't finish to that I won't get up
close again if I stay back will you be
alright if I like stay back from the
camera so you'll have to look at the
dots are close don't want you to stay
because I like you okay let's
into blush so essence gave us the satin
touch blush in the shade satin love it's
number 20 and it's really a very light
pretty shade I do feel like this may not
show up as well on deeper skin tones I
don't know though it's very pigmented it
may just be a little too peachy
we'll try it pigmented so we're gonna
use our own stippling brush whoa holy
moly too much too much you're gonna try
to move very said she's gonna try it say
are you talking about the dots you gonna
try it do it girl let's start at read me
and you we got this this blush is pretty
that's it to make some really nice
blushes I told him I said I really want
to do a grand reveal
then they said they were gonna send me a
bunch of stuff our brand new anything
every good well I don't know I may just
do it anyway with what I have but I
would love to have even more to tell you
about I can't afford to buy everything
in a lot especially all these crazy fake
we ship things we're doing my husband's
downstairs doing a budget right now
because who knows like you know when you
kind of overextend yourself a little bit
you're like yeah that's kind of whatever
that will kick now cuz we already spent
a lot of money money to belong to
Iceland and a few weeks which is another
thing so are you gonna try the doctors
that you should and then send it to me
email it to me Jen loads reviews at
gmail.com I'd love to see how it looks
on you the blusher just uses the essence
satin touch blush in the shade 20 satin
love of up essence this is a fabulous
brands hopefully it lasts a long time my
cheeks that's what I'm hoping
okay so for highlighter and this was the
big product that we got from Smashbox
that I was really excited to show you
they gave us the Casey Holmes spotlight
palette in Pearl and I haven't used it
yet and I'm very excited to use it
so it looks like this I was very
surprised it almost feel like it's gonna
help with a squishy cover on here I
didn't realize that it was like it's
kind of weird like I don't know it's a
kind of salt here it doesn't dig in but
it seemed like it only should you know
be beauty good advice she says here are
different ways to wear dot liner three
three dots as a wig wing and one dot
three dots under a wing one dot middle
lower lash liner three dots lower lash
line 1 dot inner corners with the wing
two to three dots for them for the brow
bone well that's interesting
holy moly that's very interesting Sarah
says essence nail polishes the bomb I've
tried a little bit as in nail polish and
I definitely liked it so here's the
Casey Wong spotlight CO and make sure I
don't have any blush left on my fingers
here and we're going to swatch i've
swatched it but i haven't used it yet
let's put it here so this last one has
glitter in it just so you
it's got good when he says just bought
the lorac Pirates of the Caribbean much
cotton recommendation it's so awesome
soft and pretty
I brought it with me to two generation
beauty and I've used it almost everyday
so I'm glad you like it as much as I do
Beauty says yes under the arts let's
countries thing I've never heard of that
good mary says it sounds like Morse code
I'm down let's do it we got this we got
this so anyway the highlight palette
this glitter is not my thing
it's too glittery but these are
definitely more my style
so we're gonna go ahead and let's do
this one right here in the center
okay we're gonna do something that is
kind of weird I'm gonna give this really
big eyeshadow brush to highlight no I'm
not that's the Sun what's going to but I
can't do that
all right here we go what okay here's a
motor motor fan that's the silver let me
use the stellar shade
I don't watch Spacey home is getting
very long time you guys watch Pacey
mom's she doing well she seems to be
doing well she's blabbering the Smashbox
units beginning though they subscribe to
30 years ago and I met her one time say
my name Etsy understand to be on that
Facebook and on New York like the Inc 48
before I bet okay that is a very pretty
place hey man my Bam Bam and then let's
go back into the next belt
where's the next palette we'll do a
little contouring and then we'll do some
lips we got about 15 minutes left to
check amanda says I want to go to jumpy
from New York I've been trying to talk
my hubby and taking me off so good and
get the tickets now if you're gonna do
it cuz they're cheaper now than they
will be later a CB Sarah makeup
revolution Pro glow palette is my
highlighter palette okay awesome
Lisa says I don't watch her should i I
don't know what during years they've
each beauty watches are sometimes
oh hi Terry
Katherine says well I'm going to take
off every one have another everyone got
to get another look oh oh because she
just moved into a new house I hope you
love me a new house family mary says
you're having is popular to win well I
would imagine nothing less than from a
little bit I know about Phase II moms at
the home attorney be super puffy pants
can use the same fan brush I'm using
mixed contra puppet I'm using the
your shade the later boots on machine
this one right now yeah it's very light
but I think it's the brush that I'm
using to there we go okay so the next
thing is this is the last finger right
now there's two more things and the last
people to show you is something that I'm
really excited about that I wasn't
expensive but when I got it and I tried
it and I was like oh my gosh oh wow
who's by Katherine Jenna says I want the
fan brush that Kristin game uses off to
look and see what she uses I'm not sure
what she uses sherry says actually
supposed to be nice coughing not
metallic obvious oh this highlighter
this is a very very bright metallic ii
poppy highway this is Jacqueline ho
level like this is this is like
glow-in-the-dark level new mayor said it
just some Jacqueline tell how it's all
put the dots in my eye look there you go
do it girl
I'm not got my Jacqueline health palette
yet if I blast my Chuck behind even
chefs and I'm sure sad because the one
to review up friendly frankly this is
the natural vanilla mint lip repair ball
by skin fix and I haven't used it yet
but I wanted to use it as kind of these
it's very whaling
it feels nice it does smell like vanilla
mint I don't feel any of them into
tingly kind of feeling about what I like
it feels good doesn't feel like anything
magical doesn't have the ingredients on
here so oh yeah does petrolatum for
number one ingredient and then coconut
oil beeswax
so nothing magical as far as the
ingredients cook it I wish the coconut
oil was higher than the petrolatum but
it is what it is but it's nice it's nice
not for my soft off but it's nice and
then this is what I wouldn't show you
and then we just kind of chat a little
bit this is the nude sticks
this is hashtag babe phosphate color box
that they gave us and oh my gosh and I
am absolutely loving these so it came of
all of these colors and a sharpener and
they are matte lip colors so they look
like liquid lipsticks on the lips but
their crayons and oh my gosh like
totally totally making me happy so I'm
gonna go ahead and put on this one I
have to try this one yet it's called sin
but they're beautiful they're absolutely
beautiful I don't know if you can see
that but they have with all the shapes
watch them you know like little things
from different influencers so let's see
Samantha from the Samantha Channel on
here
Oh megan is not petroleum though it's
petrolatum it's different it's I think
it's the same base but it's not
petroleum it's petrolatum
eet rol 80 um so it's some different
it's the same base but I think it's a
different thing
all right this is yep
oh this one looks different this one
actually this is a lipid she could have
so this is different this is what I was
using the intense matte lip and cheek
pencil this is the one I just opened its
more like a wood base and then this is
the ones that I've been using that's
interesting
okay well let's try this one lip and
cheek pencil I haven't used this one yet
let's go for it and there's a mirror
inside which is nice let's use it
looks pretty in my eyes I like the color
and it's gonna perform definitely
because I do have the lip ball under it
so but there is a glossy it is glossy
but these are matte these right here
that's what I thought I was gonna be
using today was them that it doesn't it
doesn't look matte right now but it
dries down to that I think this one does
one
yeah intense matte and it looks like a
liquid lipstick my only problem was is
as I layered it it tended to kind of
crumble off if I layered it too much so
just be careful with that if you're
using none and oil is not its friend so
using our oil-based lip balm with you
might not have been an idea now like
soon you're thinking like oh yeah we all
broke it down and then I used an
oil-based lip foam underneath it I don't
know what I'm thinking but it looks
pretty for now we'll see how it goes
as I wear it I do like the way it looks
it looks nice so so yeah but anyway I
really like this so far except for the
crumbling thing was an issue oh my gosh
I can't wait to tell me buddy chat how
amazing it is and they're like it's very
fumbling on you that one time the
pencils do not drag no they are very
very creamy classic pencils easier to
sharpen than the wooden ones I have
sharpened these particular ones yet but
I think keep you posted on that if you
ask me later I haven't I've instructed
them yet but I find the ones with too
like the black like yet like the
plasticky stuff being easier to sharpen
than what I find the wood will sometimes
splinter and kind of chip off where that
is more with a smooth roll at least from
other brands I haven't sharpened because
like I said Jenna says she thinks
plastic is way harder I think it just
depends on the brand and I'm thinking
about like some of my eyeliners that I
have they're more of a plastic and
they're easier but I don't know maybe
it's just the products that we're
talking about Jenna Yumi said is there a
release date for the Kat Von D shimmer
collar I don't think we have one yet but
I've been out of the loop for a couple
weeks so I don't know page says oMG my
nail polish collection they're all it's
all free shelf
but I do love them I just love colors
hey Chaz I was just watching another one
here video something AJ says I hope I
get the nude stick in my Ipsy bag yeah I
mean I I in the past thought you'd stick
lipsticks were kind of ordinary and then
I tried these and I liked them and so I
started wearing them more and realized
the flakiness was an issue but I'm still
playing with them I haven't completely
given up on them we're still we're still
in the testing phase on them Kari had no
idea Vaseline is flammable
is it I don't think it'd be too much oil
in it for it to be feeling I guess or
less flammable so says you've got that
people make it go thank you so much
it just says Vasiliev on a cotton ball
is a tried and true fire started for
Girl Scouts really odds in Girl Scout
they need to teach us back I think I was
too young I didn't make it up that night
Oh another thing that we got that I'm
actually I've saved one for giveaway
ever I'm gonna keep this one we had
gotten this Luxy brush set in another
generation beauty swag bag and I was
kind of like do I really need it should
I give it away so it's been in my
giveaway box for a while and then we
just got another one so I'm going to
keep this one this is emini detail rose
bowl collection brush set so these are
gonna be added to my newly decluttered
push compaction these are so cute aren't
they they're so tiny so there's gonna be
one of you who's in a giveaway as well
they're so rude I should have used some
and I will show you something that I'm
excited about that we've got not I got I
am going to be doing I'm hoping I'm
hoping I can get it done I want to do a
video just showing how I did my makeup
for travel the way that I did my eye
shadow and I want to use this I got this
I don't think anybody else got this
because I think that I'm constantly
giving motor shoutouts and didn't know
how much I love them so they gave me one
of the new
that but these are not out yet please
come out sometime this month
I don't know then but they're the murder
Prismatic but they're the eye brushes
and the comedies beautiful case so I'm
going to hopefully be using this in the
video with tutorial type style video
which I don't typically do but I want a
reason to use this there it was a fluffy
brush in here and then there's like a
detail almost ago it's like a blending
brush but I would use this for look if I
got too much pigmentation in my outer
corner you did to kind of blend it out I
needed something step I would use this
and then there's a small packing like
shader brush here and then a little eye
eyeliner brush and on the wash I was so
thankful that you gave us food on so I
will definitely be using this in videos
soon but I didn't want open it yet so
I'm going to use it in a video video
instead of in the live chat so I'm
excited about it then it's got a crease
brush of smoky eye brush to scruff let
smudger and an end of liners they've got
these coming out I have pictures on my
Instagram yeah these coming out they
have another set of these kinds of
brushes coming out and then they have
the paddle brushes that looked like this
they have those coming out in like a
rose gold shade that's the Seattle
incident and they also have this is what
I'm really excited about boiling my
nickel it's the smile line they have any
brush - oh that is one of them is for
your cleanser you'll see it on my
Instagram it's like a bubbly kind of top
and what you're supposed to do is use it
almost I thought it with a non-rotating
Clarisonic to kind of get your cleanser
into your skin you just kind of rub it
around with the brush and then it comes
with a facemask brush like where there's
exquisitely a foundation brush but
they're calling a face mask brush and
you can put the face mask on the thing I
was like oh my gosh that is so genius
like really really smart to do so I'm
really excited for the spa lines that
come out I think that was really smart
of them Jenna says if I buy the beauty
junkies ice at will the fluffy crease
brush should be good enough to not buy
the e for less than their yes in my
opinion yes I have both and I like them
equally they're exactly the same for me
just make sure you're washing the
brushes facing this way facing downward
so that you don't get water in the
ferrule I know you already know this
Jenna but other people might not but
because I think that that's part of the
reason why some of the grassy areas
before
the part for some people is that they
were watching their brushes this way in
the water just getting into the barrel
reading the brushes so much she wash
your brushes this way you guys lead the
club to the nail polishes job the
girlfriend and want to I love them but I
love that I don't love to declutter my
baby and they were pretty up there if I
get clarity to the lookout you wouldn't
look as good pay cesky by motor brushes
in Canada yes you should be able to get
them I'm pretty sure you guys have
Walmart's in Canada you should be able
to get them there if you go to the mode
of rush website it'll tell you all the
routes all locations and where they sell
them including Canada but I'm pretty
sure they sell them at at Walmart's new
family got any other questions or
anybody want to talk about anything
before we go
Oh Maori says by the way Jen I get so
many compliments about the bare mineral
Jen you use masks I got them because you
suggest them I absolutely love them on
things wonderful I really love that it's
it's it smells good it feels good it
builds nicely they don't the best
lasting power but I'm so glad you love
them just as much as I do that's awesome
rebellion at Walmart I don't know Aaron
says the polishes we've got the painting
heat yes you have Walmart's yeah then
we'll be fine James says what are you
doing in Iceland we are going to do a
lot of like sightseeing kinds of things
because one thing that's great about
Iceland is that a lot of its free
because it's a nature-based so we're
gonna drive down to the icebergs and I
don't know how to say it but it's like
drew personal superswim I don't know but
if the iceberg is down and the southern
part of isolates we're gonna drive down
there already the car and we are gonna
do the hot spring it's called the Blue
Lagoon so we're gonna do that and then
there's some other Lakes like some kinds
of things there's some hot big hot
springs to see kind of like what we saw
the newer in um in Yellowstone so there
should be some springs there and stuff
like that so we're really excited about
it really really excited to try I think
it's called spur or see if the Icelandic
yogurt I'm really excited to try that
separates
music so so yeah as your whose assets
are you going to juggler you San
Francisco no I don't be a junkie dancing
this way this time I'm going to be with
my family we're talking about going down
my parents have a place under me to the
island so we're thinking about going
down there and spending some each time
down there in August so I think each
other's review at any census I think
that's the one that's in August I'm
pretty sure either that or will be at
Iceland either way I'm gonna be with my
family so I don't be a Genovese and
disco buddy I'm planning to go to
Germany New York
page says will you buy the blue the good
skin care line skin oh I don't know I
didn't know they had one
oh maybe no it's really good well maybe
I wanna ski in Iceland the skin Iceland
is out talking about the skin Iceland
stuff I actually bought a bunch of that
with me too when I went to gem UT I
didn't want to bring my current skincare
which is just too bulky so I brought my
skin eyes when I had some travel sizes
so and I do really like spit ice and
stuff if that's what you're talking
about
I've been really enjoying so no I mean I
don't like the body because it's very
cold feeling it's not like I'm in deep
feeling and I'm not sure if I like the
way that feels on the skin it's just a
personal preference unique on is in
August I've heard good things got to eat
on did people really like Beauty thought
they really don't like I'm never gonna
be fun so I don't know Billy says every
wonderful summer I am having them for

amazing vacation it was fabulous

wonderful so but anyway I should play
cop off there 11:02 spend some time with
my kiddos we're going through a time
where we're trying to start like a
really limiting their media like and
their iPod usage we are I think I won
that I've been a bad parent past and and
let my kids really spend way too much
time in their media because I've been
lazy parent and I'm not proud of it
so here trying to get the kids off of
the iPad which requires a lot more
attention it's good during the summer to
you know help them to be ever-changing
things so I'm going to go ahead and
you got maybe bit expensive time with my
kids last night my son and I we ended up
playing with this magnet toy that I
bought him for Christmas and he never
played with it because he's always on
his iPod and we had the best time
