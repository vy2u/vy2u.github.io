the makeup chat I am so happy to be here
all gods put my microphone on let's do
that again hello my friends welcome to
much over makeup chat I am so happy to
be here chatting he was chatting with
you this morning with my shot of face
and my ugly hair my hair looked so bad
this morning I was like oh no I didn't
have time to do anything with it so I'm
like almost putting it up and that's
just the way it's gonna be I got my
little goofy little weird bun looking
thing I don't even know what's going on
with that and my headband and mm-hmm
but we're among friends here and it's
okay to not look your best every single
day still the cool we're gonna do
something about that though because I've
got a ton of products to show you that
you were either sent to me by brands or
things that I have bought recently or
some things that friends sent to me
things like that so I've got so much I
want to share with you and I'm really
excited to show you some of the stuff
because chances are you will not see
some of the stuff on any other channel
so that's what I'm most excited about
but before we get started
wanted to remind you those of you that
are watching this on the replay that
have never seen one of my live chats
before I do do a live chat which means
that I like to talk to the people that
I've invited into my home so if you
don't enjoy me stopping in the middle of
getting ready answering questions talk
to people if you don't like that format
I'm really sorry I have a ton of other
content on my channel that I hope that
you will absolutely love this may not be
the best video to start with but if you
love tot of me talking to people that
maybe even know more than I do a lot of
times they do and you like learning from
more than just one person at a time you
are in the right place because the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
is exactly that they are awesome a lot
of times they give me insights into
things that I wouldn't have thought
about and it's a great way to extend our
knowledge by talking to a lot of people
at the same time so let me go ahead and
close this little comment here and I'm
going to go ahead and say hello to the
people in the whatsapp and makeup chat
and hello to liz liz is here stephanie

happy that you're here you know just
chill we're gonna we're gonna just chill
and relax and it's going to be a good
happy safe place for late in the evening
good morning to Valerie and Denise a
nice small chat today yeah let me see
how many people are here right now we've
got can I even see how many people I
used to be able to see how many people
but Oh 108 people that's not a whole lot
of people that's nice though it's nice
to have a less craziness happening
sometimes good morning to Nancy Nancy
I'm going to show a couple of things
that you sent me I'm going to show the
brushes that you sent reading mom is
here Ashley is here Michelle and Steph
are here thank you to my wrench wrenches
my women who are going to take care and
make sure we don't have any drama this
morning and block the creepers thank you
so much Mimi is here says I have an
alarm set so I have time to check my
battery take off the dogs and get here
in time for chat yeah I paraphrase the
ending and Maseo kisses here Megan is
here thank you so much everybody's here
if I didn't get to say hello to you
hello to you let's go ahead and get
started so there's a couple of things
that I want to show you before we get
started I'd have written down some of
the prices of things for you ahead of
time so I have that information for you
so the first thing I won't
technically be using today but I really
wanted to show you these are by an Etsy
brand called slay Beauty and have a
really funny story to go with it so
these are magnet homemade magnet
like pallets but they do not feel like
they are you know slapped together by an
amateur these things feel but super
super Pro they're really really nice
this is the black one it's the same
price as this one this one's called the
spectrum one she's not paying me that
for this or anything she sent these to
me because there was a woman on Etsy we
actually found out who she was we found
out where she lived somebody like hunted
her down I didn't do it somebody hunted
her down but she was posing as me on
Etsy and asking people to send her
things for review on the channel but it
wasn't me it was somebody else
so I was getting all these Instagram DMS
and emails and things saying hey this
seems a little fishy I just want to make
sure it was you before I sent product
some people sent her product I felt so
bad
but I put up a note on my youtube About
section I tweeted it out like I try to
let people know that it was not me
because that's the worst people to rip
off as Etsy sellers you know because
they invest so much of their own
personal money in these products and it
you know it's not like a big company
that they lose one product or two
products it's not that big of a deal
like these are like hard-working people
you know and it just it broke my heart
but anyway so the woman over it's lady's
end them to you anyway I was like yeah
definitely I'll try them show them in a
live chat so they cost 1199 each and
they're big they're really big let me
see I do have a magnetic palette thing
that I'm going to show you in a minute
so let me show you how big it is compare
well these are big pans these etsy pans
are huge but so they fit in there but
the typical like Mac eyeshadow is
actually smaller than this you can fit a
lot of like the regular pans in here but
I keep saying um buh-buh-buh-buh-buh I
was going to say there's pictures on the
Etsy site of this thing full with
shadows so you can see about how many it
fits I'm not sure how many it fits but
so that's the first thing I wanted to
show you
so that's slay Beauty on Etsy now we are
going to talk about the brushes because
I'm gonna have to use the brushes in
order to in order to get ready goodness
can I speak today I haven't spoken to
any humans yet today so my kids are away
and my husband is at the gym so I
haven't talked to anybody yet today so
my addiction is a little
see here so these are by a brand called
LH cosmetics linda hallberg cosmetics
it's out of Switzerland Sweden Swiss was
somewhere so was somewhere somewhere the
starts with a swoop they are let's see
this brusha is called the basic kit it's
$59 these were sent to me by my friend
Nancy to try along with one of their
palettes so I want to try these today it
looks like it's got a really nice amount
of brushes as far as like it's got a
nice selection of things to use so we're
going to be playing with these today and
also sent to me oh my gosh I did not buy
this but I am so thankful the wonderful
people over at Luxy Beauty they really
appreciate when we feature them in the
makeup minute and when we feature them
in the in what's it been makeup so they
were kind enough to send me the Wonder
Woman brush set so we're going to play
with it today but I have to show you
because this is just stinking gorgeous
so it came with a bow tied on top and
then this is how it comes it's $95 oh my
gosh it's $95 but their big face brushes
and you're also getting the whole Wonder
Woman nostalgia thing I really feel like
a lot of this the Wonder Woman stuff is
really for collectors and that's why the
price kind of jumps up so if you love
the Wonder Woman series and you love
Wonder Woman then that would be why you
would pay $95 for something like this
because look how beautiful this look at
this presentation it's sick it's
absolutely sick in a good way sick
meaning amazing so it also comes with a
case that says Luxy on it for you to
keep your brushes after you're done with
the box if you don't want to keep them
in the box and it comes with a guide
that shows you everything about you know
how to use each one they've this cute
little Wonder Woman look at picture over
here with how you use each brush so I'm
gonna set this and let me show you oh my
gosh girlfriend oh my gosh oh my gosh
look at this look at this look at that
presentation it's insane I'm gonna save
the mirror for last I really hope they
sell the mirror separately because that
thing is sick it's sick okay but anyway
so it comes with this
the flat kabuki this is the Luxy 8:30
and they do feel exactly the same as a
typical Luxy brush it doesn't seem like
there's anything different about the way
the bristles are than a regular Luxy
brush brush so I don't know that for a
fact
but it doesn't seem any different just
so you know there's no like extra good
quality but they're very very soft Luxy
brushes are wonderful
I've always enjoyed Luxy brushes ever
since I started getting them in my Ipsy
bag but anyway so this is the first one
and they've got the pointed handle down
here and this is you can see this is
like the gold part sticks up and the
blue was kind of behind and then here so
that's that one and then this one is for
like contouring so this is the 8:34
brush and then we have the giant fan
brush which I always have trouble
figuring out how to use giant fan
brushes but we're going to find
something to do with this we're going to
use it for a highlighter or something
because I just decluttered a big brush
like that but I'm not decluttering this
one I'll tell you that this is the 8:32
brush this one can be used for like
buffing in stuff or you can use it for
pressed powder I'm probably an user for
press powder for setting powder and then
this one is the blush brush this is the
Luxy 8:36 and I love the points on these
I love blush brushes that have a point
because I feel like it just sweeps right
on this is very thick too it's going to
pick up a lot of product so with the
itse blushes that I use I'm gonna have
to use a really light hand with this
because they're very pigmented and this
is going to pick up a lot of product and
then finally last but not least the
mirror oh my gosh the mirror the mirror
look at this thing this thing is so
heavy it's like like solid it's metal
like metal metal not cheapy metal not
fake metal with a metal gloss over it
like metal and then it opens up like
this and it's got the Wonder Woman on
the side and then it's got the Luxy on
this side and this is like listen to
this wait put over here like that is
hardcore like this there's no joke about
this this is this is insane how nice
this is so I can see where the price
point comes from I'm sure a lot of it
comes from this mirror because this is
ridiculous
so it's really
how big of a fan are you and that's
whether it's worth it or not because I
don't see anything at least to the touch
I don't see anything about the brushes
that make them better than the regular
Luxy brushes you're paying for the
Wonder Woman you're paying for the
packaging and you're also paying for
this case and you're paying for the
mirror so that's why it's more anyway
because that's the biggest complaint
I've heard about the Wonder Woman
brushes if they're very expensive so I'm
going to take them out of the case so I
can use them a little more functionally
and we'll put that right down here and
we'll set them there so that they're
ready to use okay so now we can actually
get into applying some makeup so picked
up this ed buff stuff with your stuff
buffer yes that's exactly what you do
Lily says Alexi welcome to their
newsletter code works for 20% off that
is wonderful to know thank you so much
Alisa
saw a Wonder Woman yesterday my boys
took me and I had chills and teared up
so yes I need these brushes there you go
trend mood Yesenia says the trick code
trend mood also works for 20% off $78 is
what she paid for the brush set so that
makes it a little more able to be
stomached when you use the discount code
that's awesome and Sarah says bronzer
forehead hairline with a big fan brush
you know I really have bad luck with
bronzing like here and contouring my
nose it's too much for me it's just it's
beyond my skill set it's just beyond so
we're going to start with the prime time
foundation primer by bare minerals
because I don't have a new foundation
primer to show you and this one's really
good because my face is so shiny today I
must I like I moisturize before I went
to bed but I washed your eyes this
morning and my face is just they seem to
moisturize enough so we're going to use
the we're not going to use a Whalley
primer I was going to use my josie maran
but I don't think I need all that today
so we're just going to use the prime
time so we're gonna put that over here
so put that out of the way so I have a
little more space and I forgot my mirror
urgh oh I've got a little mirror over
here we just won't use the glow one okay
for foundation I have gotten so many
compliments I wore this
the last livestream that I did with the
Tarte palette that we're going to play
with a little bit today this is the
ultimate foundation and I got so many
compliments like your skin looks amazing
what foundation are using Ulta brands
mm-hmm it's nice it's very nice Brandi
wants to know what palette I'm going to
use I am going to use the Olympus
palette by Chris Anna and cosmetics and
Chris Anna Ann is a very small makeup
company but they're really nice shadows
I've used them a couple of times and I'm
very excited to built them so I'm going
to show you them in action so that's for
eye shadow and I'm also going to use the
Tarte palette kind of as a base because
this is more like a shimmery goodness
and I'm going to use the new Tarte
palette as kind of a base for that I'm
just going to slap these on no mirror
makeup challenge Oh Steph wanted
someone's asking about the super chat oh
I forgot to show you something I did
disable the super chat for a while and
so I can use up some of the money that's
already been donated I still have about
$200 that I need to spend so it'll
probably be re-enabled
after in the fall is probably when it's
going to be re-enabled okay I can see
myself so this is something that I
should have showed you before I started
so this is another thing that was sent
to me this is a UK company this is
called this foundation is going to dry
on me while I'm doing this so let me let
me talk to you about what it is well I'm
putting it on so this brand is called
sponge dry and it's a company called
basic beauty tools and basically the
idea behind it they send you the sponge
with it the idea behind it is it's
supposed to sit your Beauty Blender up
so that it doesn't collect mold and be
gross in your drawer and get all over
everything
it's like kind of like how Beauty
Blender had some some different like
little cases you could put your Beauty
Blender in but they were stupid
expensive and they actually sat on the
product so if there was any moisture at
the bottom then it could grow mold at
the bottom because it's sitting in its
own moisture so this I'll show you the
design in a second so this the way that
it works is that you set this inside
and it's it's up over the bottom and it
like kind of hugs it I did have to kind
of press down over here to make sure it
was fully fully down but yeah so it so
it like sits up isn't that cute
so I told them that I would you know I
wasn't going to do a full review on it
because it just seemed like you know a
lot to do a full review on this little
case but I wanted to show you and it
comes with the sponge the sponge is
super super soft is very Beautyblender
feeling because it's so incredibly soft
it's softer than the the Real Techniques
ones real technique one is definitely
has a little more into it it's softer
than the pure the pure cosmetics one
it's definitely more similar to the
Beauty Blender and this all together is
1899 for both so if you think you're
going to spend $20 on a beauty blender
this you're going to get a very similar
sponge this is the first time I've used
it and it worked really well but I can't
you know speak to longtime use of it but
you get the sponge and you get the
little thing and there's a bunch of
different colors too there's black
there's white there's pink there's
purple so I think that's really cool and
then they send the sponges separate you
can buy extra sponges as well a chair
for your Beautyblender yes staff exactly
it's like a little seat so and it's also
kind of pretty you know you set it up
and it's pretty it doesn't seem like
super strong so you don't want to pull
on this really hard because it's just
plastic so you definitely want to be
careful not to like yank it open but it
also collapses as well I didn't show you
that it collapses and then comes back up
but like I said you want to press here
to make sure it's fully extended but
yeah I'm really excited about this
because this is the first time I've used
it and the sponge is super solved and
none of these companies are paying me
they just sent me the product and I you
know no obligation to review I did tell
a couple of the companies that I would
mention it but I didn't you know they're
not paying anything for it just so you
know
so that's blending my foundation
beautifully I'm not going to cake on the
foundation today because today we're
going to we're going to go to a place
called Larry land farm and it's a place
where you can pick your own strawberries
so the family is going to go do that
today that's why I couldn't do the
evening chat today mo loves makeup says
they have spring ones on Amazon free
pack less than eight dollars is that
um it must be some other brand yeah but
it comes with both so it comes with the
sponge and the the little thingy let me
see if what everybody's saying how soft
is it compared to the Loreal one I don't
own the Loreal one so I don't know but I
can tell you that is extremely soft let
me show you the squish on it really okay
I'm barely even pushing on it it's
really soft really really soft it
doesn't seem to be soaking up a stupid
amount of product either it definitely
is soaking up some product but I don't
think it's more than any other sponge
let me see anything else that I'm
missing which brand is the sponge in the
sitter this is called basic beauty tools
is the name of the brand it's a UK
brands and the product is called the
sponge dry so that is that alright I'm
going to put that aside now and we're
going to put on some setting powder this
was sent to me by Influenster a while
back this is the laura mercier setting
powder and I have been in love with this
I've used this a lot
I used to use I was I was very confused
for a long time about whether there was
really truly a difference between
setting powder and finishing powder is
there really a difference in formulation
and honestly I haven't looked it up to
make sure they're really truly is a
difference in formula but I trust makeup
artists and you know that they know that
there is truly a difference between
setting powder and and finishing powder
but this is a setting powder and it is
supposed to take the shine off and make
my foundation stay on longer which I'm
going to need today cuz I'm going to be
out in the Sun I just realized I did not
put on a sunscreen I'm gonna have to
spray on a sunscreen that bums me out I
don't really like spray on sunscreen
because I don't like inhaling them but I
didn't put on sunscreen
ergo I'm not putting it on right a
second though I'm not happy about that
though that's not my ideal way to put on
sunscreen
I saved this from my declutter I had
decluttered this Tarte brush and then I
realized how much I loved it for setting
powder so I took it out of the
decluttered but I love this setting
powder it's really beautiful leaves a
nice finish to the skin lasting power is
really good on it too
Emily says I love Physicians Formula
Youth powder oh my gosh it makes my skin
look like a baby that's awesome
Ashley says like I finally see sitting
here 20 minutes waiting for live to
start oh no what happened we've been
here we've been hanging out oh no
Vee hey it's V from Viva dreamcatcher I
just watched a crazy video on this
channel what did she say first good
morning Jen did you see I tagged you in
the new tag rity I didn't see you tag me
but oh my gosh it's crazy so what she
did I have to tell you this real quick
one V did was she you know she has a 17
step makeup routine she took all the
steps you know primer foundation eye
shadow eye primer eyeliner mascara she
put him on those slips of paper and she
put him in a beer stein
and then she reaches in and she pulls
one out and you have to go in the order
that you pull so maybe you'll be putting
on your blush before your foundation or
your eyeliner before your eye primer you
know and the the look V I love you but
that looking about like a hot steak a
mess it was so funny I loved it it was
great so V dreamcatcher is her channel
it's so good oh my gosh I was dying I
was dying I did not see you tagged me
but I would love to do that I have
another video that I really want to do
with my friend Meredith that I've it's a
secret for right now but I'll tag V in
it because it's going to be a it's going
to be a tag thing that I'm making up but
I have to get my friend Meredith over to
my house because this video cannot be
done without my friend Meredith and just
can't be done my friend Meredith works
at our tattoo studio she's a tattoo
artist so she's really into makeup so
she's really good with art way better
than I am all right hold on let me put
some of this stuff to the side so that
it's out of the way okay so next up I'm
going to put on a little bit of eye
primer I'm just going to use the Ulta
eye primer it's very similar to the
Urban Decay primer potion and Eden it's
not the same but it's very similar
I also have a mask review that I want to
do with my friend Mary Lynn because she
loves face masks I have a mask review
and I got to get them over to my house
so I can film with them I think they get
nervous okay
well Meredith probably isn't but Mary
Lynn might be yes
tabatha says murder Burt is Meredith's
Instagram yes Emmy our tae ERT thanks
Tabitha for the reminder if you want to
see her tattoos Billy says you should do
the shadow crews that Emily no well did
drawing out random eye shadows out of
the bag and using them it's similar to
that but I think it's going to be even
more fun than that it's an extension of
that okay so we're going to go in with
the tart clay play eyeshadow palette and
I really like this more than I thought I
would I really do I think that this is
going to be a great eyeshadow palette
for people that are kind of just on the
go and don't want to have to think they
did really smart where a lot of tart
eyeshadows they will muddy together on
my eyes these do not do that and I think
part of it is the color selection that
they chose that they're so apart from
each other you know you've got a solid
light solid medium and a solid deep and
there's no way that they're going to
muddy together because the colors are so
different so they just end up blending
really beautifully together I did look
up at the ingredients on this to see if
it's different than other tart
eyeshadows in the past and it is very
slightly tart uses the same ingredients
in every single eyeshadow palette except
for they switch up the order depending
on the color so it's always the same
thing it's just different you know
different order and then some of them
have the vanilla in it and some of them
don't so some of them smell and some of
them don't this one does smell I'm going
to use this one right here by the way
this is called dunes I'm gonna use this
in my crease they do kick up a bit of
powder but anyway so the only difference
the brand-new fancy ingredient that is
in these palettes that is not well than
all the new ones that is not in the
other ones is water I don't know what
that does or why it's there but
apparently it's doing something magical
means eyeshadows because I like them
better than I like previous tart
eyeshadows
and the lasting power has been good all
know what's going on but tarts got into
something good here and it's all of the
newer palates that are coming out I
noticed have the water in them so I'll
know what's I don't know what the deal
is with that okay so now I've got my
crease color down from Tarte and we're
going to go ahead into the Crisanta and
olympus palette this is really cool this
is all based on Greek gods and goddesses
and you can see there's a lot of the
foiled finish and there's a lot of the
matte so let me count how many maps
there's one two three let me show you
one two three four matte so not a lot of
mattes mostly the shimmer everything
else is shimmer in here so the names
Razoo Sao Paolo hero Hermes Dionysus
things like that and girlfriend a
boyfriend girlfriend or boyfriend
show you a few of them let's do this one
I'm gonna do a little smoochie smoochie
this is over my foundation hand but oh
my gosh
okay let's play so I'm just going to go
ahead and pop this one on the middle of
my lid this is here oh actually I'm
going to mix that I'm going to mix hero
with Artemis even though I'm wearing a
cool colored shirt it is what it is
we're going to go back and forth a
little bit and this brush is a little
bit fluffy for what I'm trying to do but
we'll see whether it works or not yep
it's working let's go back and forth a
little bit more let's see is that two
blacks there's one black Hades is black
and Persephone is black with silver
glitter in it and the silver glitter
does fall away by the way it's not um it
doesn't stay that we're going to just
have fun today if my look comes out
crazy I don't care because we're just
gonna bleh
and I'm just going to the strawberry
field and people want to judge me at the
strawberry field they can look at that
lady with the crazy makeup oh okay I'm
gonna do what I won't do alright now
we're just going to go into it is
kicking up a little bit of powder Hera
is that really a sh Lee
Ashley says here as pronounced Hera I
didn't know that I've always said hero
forever since the beginning of time
since I was in middle school when I
first learned that Greek gods existed
I've always said hero its Hera huh well
there you go
Mimi says thrift dick said that the
black in that palette is sick oh I
didn't know Kashi got this palette
that's cool
I didn't realize that did I miss a video
or just talk about it in live chat I
missed it
that is not showing up as much I'm
blaming the brush I think I need I'm
gonna get you know what I'm going to use
my fingertip because this is a maze
getting out here with all my lights and
everything I'm just going to Pat it in
but because I think the brush that I'm
using is a little bit too fluffy for
what I'm trying to do here there we go
that's what I'm talking about
you see hopefully you can see the
palette is called the olympus palette
hence by chris anna and cosmetics with a
k KR is and she does have liquid
lipsticks as well i do find them to be a
bit drying they're not my favorite
formula i do like them but they're
definitely not my favorite form of just
because they're quite drying actually
says zeus crazy AF wife Hera did I get a
right hairy hair Herc's evil stepmother
gotcha Oh Hercules I thought Hera was
supposed to be nice I need to read up on
my Greek gods and goddesses my daughter
is reading the Percy Jackson series well
we read it at bedtime together alright
you know I'm going to do no I'm not
going to do that I was going to try to
work the blue and maybe I'll work the
blue in on the lower lashline that's
what we'll do so let's do a little bit
of this one right here is one of those
blue greens let me swatch that one for
you it's very very red tone though I
don't know if you can see the shift
there I don't think I'm going to use
that one though I think I'm going to use
just this matte Brown right here this
one is called Hestia and hopefully I'm
saying these right now now I'm all
self-conscious about it so let's do that
and let's just pop that in the outer
corner because I don't need anything too
crazy today kind of work that up into
the crease well hold the brush down Jen
hold the brush down every time I have to
remind myself hold the brush down Elijah
says I love Percy Jackson yes we are
really loving it we're on the third book
I think the third one it's the one after
the Sea of Monsters it's so good if you
have a late elementary school child
they're really good I wouldn't recommend
it for before third grade because it
gets a little intense with like people
dying and stuff kind of like Harry
Potter ish Chris Oh Chris Ann is here
hi Chris Anna Christina from Chris Anna

little bit of power kick up there okay
so I think I'm done with here oh let me
let me blend out with Apollo here I'm
just gonna blend my brow bone a little
bit now it's only $10 with 50% off home
are you kidding me are you kidding me
you know what I didn't do I didn't bring
anything for eyebrows I gotta go get my
eyebrows stuff you know what I'm going
to use my Christian and palate for
eyebrows that's what we're gonna do
we're going to go with that I did use my
Tarte palette for my eyebrows yesterday
and it worked really well so we're going
to go ahead and we're going to use
Hestia as a brow product because I don't
want to get through this crazy
amazing I've got going on to get to my
brow products and let's see if this
works
we're going to use it as a brow powder I
see if it works this brush is very very
thin I like a little bit thicker brushes
from a browse this LH cosmetics one at
this point I don't see that these LH
cosmetics brushes are any better than
like Luxy brushes and things like that
and $59 I feel like that is very
expensive and then if you have to pay
international shipping they don't seem
like they are 100% were that the LH
cosmetics brushes but they're so very
nice I will still use them and enjoy
them and this is working just fine
as a brow powder and Chris Anna says
thank you very support everyone I mean I
I like I was really curious and I
started looking at seeing how much it
costs to start a makeup line oh my gosh
like to make something like this would
cost thousands and thousands of dollars
just in the formulation just in
formulation before you even buy anything
like before you even buy like real
products like it's expensive to start a
makeup line I did not realize it's crazy
okay this is a little bit light for my
brows but it's working very well it's
just a little light but we're just going
to go with it and it's definitely
filling them in it's working well
there's just a little bit light but it's
not meant to do that I'm just playing
here Chris Anna and K are is a NN a and
a NN Cosmetics Chris Anna and cosmetics
calm I believe Oh Thank You Lea says I
do the same all the time use my eye
palette for more than many purposes I
can brow bronze blush highlight anything
yeah definitely multi-use is fantastic
especially if you're on a budget I
if you are on a budget I definitely
recommend watching anti hauls they're
very inspiring I've been watching a lot
of anti hauls lately I'm really enjoying
them I can show you someone Christiana
is liquid lipsticks I have a bunch she
sent me a bunch but they are a little
bit on the drier side so if you like Kat
Von D liquid lipsticks if you like steel
and liquid lipsticks if you like
the liquid lipsticks they are similar to
those okay let's see my done oh I want
to do on the lower lash line I want to
pop a little bit of this blue to match
my shirt so we're going to put a little
bit of demeter if I'm saying that right
I'm probably not saying that right now
that I know that I've been saying hair
all wrong my entire life at least this
says for Santa and cosmetics I just feel
a lil Chrisann and it came right up yep
Kathy says I want to get that palette
but I don't want to leave chat open up a
new window girlfriend well it's all day
so you know unless she sells out whoo
whoo I love that look at that that
beautiful and these you have really nice
lasting power I have used this eyeshadow
palette three or four times and they
have really nice lasting power as well
look at that
BAM that's so pretty I'm going to put a
little bit of the black this is Hades
the matte black just on the outer corner
to kind of anchor it a little bit I
always like to do a little bit of black
out here so pretty okay so we're done
with the eye look oh my gosh I love it I
love it I love it it came out great
so now let's move on and I'll get some
of the liquid lipsticks in a bit lisa
says I love your sign I got that one I
was getting tired of the other one
that'd be the change you want to see in
the world I still love that one but I
just wanted a different one so I got a
different one
what's $10 this Olympus palette by Chris
an and on sale today oh my gosh 50% off
are you kidding me Tori says my mom
having my mom ordered me some stuff on
the DL because I'm not allowed to spend
right now gotcha
and Michelle says and Wow and free
shipping on orders over $20 in the u.s.
awesome
and the liquid lipsticks are extremely
opaque now I feel like I got to go get
them hold on let me navigate this
craziness I'm going to take my
microphone off and I'm going to navigate
to get a couple of purse Anna's liquid
lipsticks they're right here
okay I wasn't planning on showing these
but because I've got the app automatics
ones I wanted to show you guys because
those are newer to me sorry that's loud
and we can spend a little extra time in
chat today if we want to because my kids
aren't home we have to go pick them up
from the grandparents okay so this is
the this is the liquid lipstick so the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous it's a
glass packaging it's got these cute
little lips on it and go flat doe foot
applicator which is my favorite style
because you can really get up into the
lip and then let me just swatch this one
is called goals AF I'll just watch a few
of them let's just put them here so this
is goals AF this one's my favorite shade
I love that one okay and then we'll do
this one is no filter it's like a
metallic shade this one's really cool
this one's really nice it's like a
metallic bronze it's really nice to like
pop in the center of another color so if
you put on this one and then you pop
this one the middle and most your lips
together and gives you that bolt that
like ombre makes your lip pop kind of
thing almost like putting a highlighter
in the middle of your lips this one
isn't quite as opaque but if you layer
it over another one it's really nice or
you can you can let it dry down and then
put another layer on top this one is
called don't do in the most there you go
and then this one these are a little too
light for me but some people really
enjoy this look BAE
okay and this one is called DM me that
DM me the nudes names are so floating
you can see the opacity they're very
opaque hey and then we get into this
one's really pretty this one's called
cakes I've used this one as a topper
before I don't really like it on its own
because it's just too Barbie looking for
me but it's really nice to kind of mix
with other shades at least for me and
what my preferences are it's got an
iridescent to it it's pink with like a
yellow iridescent shift on it I don't
know if you can see the shift you can
definitely see it in the tube and you
can see it on the lips I don't know if
you can see it hopefully you can see it
but that one's really nice to put in the
center of like a berry pink lip and kind
of it'll make your lips pop this one's
called slay and I've had these forever I
just haven't showed them to you and I
don't know why so this is a good
opportunity there slay and then this one
is called gingersnap there we go
I'm seeing people saying I'm shipping
for Canada is $24 to $10 for the pallet
plus 34 is 34 bucks with tap for taxes
okay this one is called these lips
though I mean I guess it just depends on
you know I don't know I mean it's a
really good quality palette I personally
think it's worth $30 the eyeshadow
palette that's my opinion but I can see
why some people some people just don't
buy $30 eyeshadow palettes like I was
saying in another video if you were
served a $30 bowl of ice cream would you
buy a $30 bowl of ice cream some people
will be like no I would never pay $30
for an ice cream savings some people
would never pay $30 for an eyeshadow
palette it's just not worth it it's just
eyeshadow but some people would some
people their thresholds a lot higher so
it's really what you feel is worth it
this one is the last one that I have out
and this is called turnt kind of like a
mustardy Brown
there you go so anyway so those are the
liquid lipsticks that I have I might
have one or two more but those are the
ones that I grabbed out of my drawer
right away I'm going to let those dry
down hopefully I don't get them on my
clothes
mmm-me put them to the side now because
I need to finish up my look it is ten
thirty nine but I wanted to give you an
in case you were shopping over there
give you in case you wanted to see those
in case you wanted to get those too but
Chris Anna I swear she is not paying me
for this or anything this is not I
didn't know she was showing up today I
just use the olympus palette because
it's brand new to me when not brand new
I've used it a few times so let me say
where's I need I need something to wipe
this off because this isn't going to
work because I'm going to get it all
over myself hold on a sec let me give
you the towel be right back
I would tell right here
oh my gosh oh I made it boss oh my gosh
where do you see this this is horrible
well it's good for the liquid lipsticks
but it's terrible for me look what I did
to myself I can't get the ball oh good
the balls they do last forever I forgot
about that that they like last forever
I'm gonna take some soap to that in a
bit at least it's not going to get on my
clothes because you know we're at
transfer proof right now oh my gosh okay
let's move on so next up for my look I'm
going to use the em cosmetics liquid
liner this is the the brush tip one I
have been really enjoying these hair in
the website is Chris Anna and cosmetics
kr is a and na a on a a 10 if you just
type in Chris Anna cosmetics you'll find
it
mi Mir up I am really loving these em
cosmetics eyeliners so far they're very
very black but they're very very wet so
if you have fine lines on your lid you
may have some trouble getting them not
to seep into your fine lines anyone to
know where my mug wet it's over there
with an S ton of brushes event
I need to find a different place to put
my eye brushes because I like my mug up
there too but yeah super easy to go on
you can really get that flick with MVM
cosmetics liner one trick that I do if I
find that liners are seeping into my
fine lines as I take an angled brush
like this and I just kind of run it
along the the top of it and kind of
blend out the way that it seeps in I
just kind of blend it into my you know
blend it out a bit and it works great
these this one did not seep into my fine
lines at all today though I'm not doing
a wing I'm just going to the strawberry
farm so you know not doing a wing today
Thank You Michelle Michelle put it in
the thing Paula wants to know where my
top is from it's from Amazon I've been
doing a lot of shirt shopping on Amazon
lately because returns are super easy
you just have to print out the label so
if something doesn't fit I just print
out the label and take it and the
shipping is already paid so and then I
just take it to UPS via the UPS store
not that far away Laura Lee and wants to
know how does it compare to Jessie's
Girl it's very similar I still think I
like my Jessie's Girl just a little bit
more so far but the thing is too is I
don't have long enough experience for
this because one of the big things I
hate about some liquid liners as they
drove I out really really fast it's
another reason why I really like the
Jessie's Girl so because as a spread new
to me I can't speak to that point but
it's definitely very similar I don't
know as far as the rubbing off of it
that's another thing I really like for
Jessie's Girl is that if you rub off
your wing like you try to go like this
on your wing it doesn't go away but I
honestly haven't looked at that with
this so I can't really speak to hope
it's so far so good I'm still testing it
out let's see as she says everyone was
so excited about the Physicians Formula
I booster eyelash net in ultra black I
was disappointed need a good affordable
black eyeliner the Jessie's girl was
fantastic I wouldn't say that these are
affordable though I want to say that
these were a little bit more pricey Stef
says I bought a wedding dress I'm going
I'm going to Emma I bought a dress for
wedding I'm going to on Amazon good
quality considering yes I'm surprised at
how much I like my Amazon close a lot of
these clothes that I've been wearing
lately are from Amazon alright let's
move on
so for mascara this is new to me but it
is not a small brand this is the L'Oreal
voluminous lash mascara it's the one
that looks like the Too Faced Born This
Way and I use it yesterday and I really
liked it the Wan does not look like the
board in this way the Born This Way is a
little bit more hourglass shaped it's
got a little bit of an hourglass ish
thing going on but it's PC like the
board this way like the way that the
bristles are looks similar to the board
this way I don't have a board list way
right now so I can't I can't do that V
says favorite liquid eyeliner is NYX
epic ink only seven dollars really I've
never tried that one Karen says what
drugstore eye liner compares the Kat Von
D's trooper the Jessie's Girl and then V
says the NYX I haven't tried that one
though I trust V though the NYX epic ink
but this mascara is really good it's um
I have nothing lashes so any mascara
that I try this so I don't review
mascaras on my channel any mascaras that
I try they look weak to everybody but me
because they don't ever end up looking
like false lashes ever because my lashes
don't have that potential with mascara
I've given up on trying to get false
lash look with my particular lashes it
just doesn't happen but I am getting a
lot of volume not as much length but a
lot of volume with this mascara it's
relatively wet but not super wet I like
the bristles because they brush through
really really nicely
um and I really like the effect I wore
it for my date night last night and I
really like the way that it looked but
it definitely doesn't look false lash on
me at all
the only that gives me false lash look
is false lashes Kat Von D says I did to
compare some wear test video on the Kat
Von D 1 and the NYX on the other eye and
war they wore the exact
say wow I missed that video of yours
Jenny says I want lash extensions I
don't I can't I can't mess with that
it's too much work like and I wouldn't
be able to do so much with lash
extensions you can't there's so much you
can't do but I really love the look of
this mascara it's really printing but I
really like L'Oreal mascaras overall I'm
trying to get you to be able to see it I
don't know if you can see I can't see
myself in my camera right now so I don't
know how much you can see but I really
like it definitely recommend checking
that one out okay so let's go ahead and
move into actually you know what I'm
going to do lips next the em cosmetics
liquid lipstick just a heads up though
it seems like this is just me it seems
like I'm not saying anything that this
is fact this is this is an opinion that
em cosmetics borrowed some of the idea
from bareMinerals
the formula for the em cosmetics liquid
lipsticks is almost identical to the
bare minerals Jen new line almost
identical I wish I couldn't believe how
similar they were if you look at them
next to each other it's like 80% similar
some of the ingredients are kind of
mixed up like they're kind of jumbled a
little bit they're incredibly similar so
if you like the Jen nudes you will
probably really like these are about two
dollars cheaper than the Jen nudes but
you know just so you know that's the way
that it is I was shocked at how similar
they were but that's it's common for
companies to borrow ideas from other
companies and then kind of work backward
from an ingredient list of another brand
that's not unheard of but if that
bothers you just so you know that's the
thing this is the color in French nude
and this is the one that I've been
enjoying the most and the bareMinerals
genu liquid lipsticks are my faves
this might be too nude
I don't know we'll go with it for now
it's fine but they're really really um
they're very comfortable Jenna says
wears em cosmetics sold just on the em
cosmetics website faith wants to know
what mascara it was it's the new L'Oreal
voluminous lash mascara this one here oh
I want to show you the wand that was the
other thing I was thinking what did I
want to tell you the wand here the doe
foot applicator has that little dig in
there so it sits really nicely on the
lips that's something that the genu
doesn't have the Jen you has the paddle
one and this one has like the little
divot which is it's you know it's all
what you like and personal preference I
like both I think I like the paddle just
a little bit more yeah they're very very
smooth very comfortable to wear they're
not transfer proof or transfer resistant
but they just feel really good and I
love the opacity of them the only thing
about the em cosmetics ones is the red
shade that I got is extremely patchy but
the nudes are beautiful I did do I think
yes I did a first impression live chat
on that on the channel I think it's
about 10 minutes long so you can find
where I tried on all of them and my
first impressions of them alright so
we've got 10 minutes left let me go into
the cheap products so we're going to go
into it see this right here and we're
going to start using the the Wonder
Woman brushes so this is with my friend
Jess over at love for lacquer jess has
been so supportive of my channel and she
has she's just been a good person that
we've talked back and forth about
different things and she's just a really
nice supportive person she's all about
building women up and you know working
together and things like that and I just
really like her as a person so she was
very kind to get Etsy to send this to me
so I was very very thankful this is for
the products inside you get there's four
shot there's four products so you get a
blush and then there's three highlighter
shade this one's more of like a yellow
champagne
this wasn't just a tad more pinky
champagne II kind of color and then this
one is like a blush topper and then you
get the blush the
products by themselves are $35 and with
the it C palette it's $50 to get this
and it is a very nice palette I mean the
it's very strong here and then you get
the mirror and everything so it's really
whether you need the palette or not
whether you would pay the 50 or the 35
if you wanted to get this but I've been
really enjoying the products let me go
ahead and get the Wonder Woman brush
let's get into this blush brush so the
first time I've used it and let's go
ahead and dip into whoa holy moly holy
moly
Julia says I just saw this at the wetson
and makeup Facebook group oh yeah the
what to make a Facebook group we've got
like 50 people waiting to get in right
now because I haven't been helping with
the line and we just got a little behind
so if you're waiting to get in the
facebook group we're getting there
working on it have you ever looking to
join the Facebook group it's what's up
and makeup on Facebook so you do groups
slash what's up in makeup I love the
shade the shade is beautiful and it goes
perfectly with my eye look because it's
like a peachy color so we're going to do
that I'm not going to contour today I'm
not feeling it okay and then I want to
do the blush top or thingy I'm going to
use this one I'll swatch all these for
you in a second and I'm going to use
this giant fan brush kind of dip in the
center there and kind of and it's that
that Jaclyn hill kind of glow it's a
very glowy highlighter like no joke
highlighter this isn't like a subtle
this is like them but I am highlighter
and lasting power on these are really
really good I think they collaborated
with a few other people I know coffee
break with Danny is one of the people
they collaborated with it see I forget
who else but yeah I don't know if you
can see the glow but the glow is there
though glow is there I feel like I might
need a deeper lip color I don't know
let me flip over to my view and seeing
how we're looking
I'm not sure if I like this lip color I
think I'm going to jazz it up a little
bit I'm going to add a little bit of
this shade here this is called muted
mole and this is the war on
I'm wearing when I wear this I feel like
I wore this in a video lately I think I
wear this for what's been makeup this
week the muted mauve
I'm just going to pop it over top kind
of brighten it a little bit we need a
little more contrast there that's a
little better I think we're looking good
I feel like I have I didn't use a lot of
the Luxy brush too suddenly here's one
brush no I used to I use the fan brush -
how many brushes can you use in a look
well and I use the the sponge instead of
the foundation brush here but I think
we're looking pretty good I think we
might be done with our look I think it's
looking good I'm very happy with it I'm
looking at myself right now I need to
stop Ashley says hole a huge fan brush
Batman Wonder Woman Wonder Woman it's
Wonder Woman but it is huge it's
gigantic
I prefer smaller fan brushes like this
one this and this is my favorite size
fan brush people tell me that there's
their shed there Eve pearl 110 shed
minds never sheds I think weight I've
lost maybe two airs over the past three
years on this thing some people tell me
they don't and then this one is for
contouring but I'm not going to contour
today I'm going to let it go and I
already buffed in my foundation I should
have used that brush to buff in my my
powder oh well too late
so let's um let's look oK we've got six
minutes left and I'm done with my look
so we are Jenny says sunscreen on your
shoulders Jen yes I will do it I promise
you I will Tara says highlighters pop
and I know right oh I want to swap these
for you real quick let me swatch them on
my other arm so this is the we're going
to do on my pointer finger is the Pinker
one this is the more yellow tone then
we'll do the blush topper and then we'll
do the blush we put these right here
ring-ring ring-ring so that's the the it
C collection is called the glam Bishan
collection
Yesenia wants to know where you can find
the face palette this is on etsy.com
itts e is the name of the brand
that's where you
it Michelle says my name was on the
contributing listen what's if a makeup I
was so excited yeah that's awesome
diva wants no I'm going to do perfume
with Deepa oh my gosh Deepa I love you
if you've ever gotten ready with me on
periscope we do perfume grab-bag we
should do that we should let me see if I
can get here without killing myself oh
my gosh I'm gonna trip and fall ah
okay we'll do the big perfume grab bag
you may know that I get um I have been
getting was it sent bird for ever I've
been getting set bird semper it is a
subscription service they said you like
a rollerball sized perfume every month
but I don't wear perfume everyday it's
supposed to last you all month but these
things last me way more than a month so
I've got this bag of set birds and other
roller balls and this is what we do we
go like this Brandi says it's been an
hour already it doesn't seem like it I
know right oh this one is not from from
Etsy ofc oh my gosh this one is not from
cent bird this is from a subscription
box Catherine Malandrino cm romance de
Provence see if I feel like wearing this
today yeah it's very sweet well wear
this today ooh choking myself put a
little bit back here ooh smells good
smells good but yeah I've got an entire
bag of like rollerball that's like Bert
and the other thing is is every time I
get a referral I get a free month so you
know if I get 12 referrals I get it for
years so I have like a free year of them
I've got so many perfumes in here it's
kind of ridiculous like oh I just
dropped one and then I get them in
subscription boxes and stuff too and
these go in here
but anyway okay any other QA let's do a
little Q&amp;amp;A for the next five minutes or
so okay let's see
Jane's hasn't been trying to find a
rollerball of dot by Marc Jacobs they
don't make that I would think they would
make that as she says I don't like
highlighters fighting very oily skin all
my life so yep don't like highlighting
that
make sense you know what you might like
though are like the like the hourglass
ambient lighting powder some people use
them all over their face but you might
like that for your little bit of glow a
little bit of glow something I don't
know if you've ever tried those or not
70 so just Stephanie stuff from talking
to Jenny Arwen says all my all-time
favorite perfume is creed spring flower

let me see did I miss anything
Oh bleeding Rainbow says has anyone
tried SL miss glam brushes um my
experience hasn't been super positive we
got some SF s s l miss glam brushes
they're gorgeous they're absolutely
gorgeous but there's a little bit of
shedding issues with those I had a
friend that got a whole brush set at
generation Beauty and she said they shed
like crazy for her and then the one that
I have it's just kind of weak I have one
of the eye shadow brushes it's not my
favorite it's not my favorite but I
don't have a lot of personal experience
with them so maybe that's just my
ignorance and not having a lot of
experience with it but basically my
friend said and and my one experience
with the one brush I wasn't a fan but
they're gorgeous they're so pretty
Julie says have you ever tried just
brushes no I've never tried Jessop

sleek palettes yes I have a plan for the
sleek palettes but I'm not going to say
anything so I'm going to film it this
week but I have a game we're going to
play with the sleek palettes but that's
all I'm going to say it's a game and
we're going to have fun with it so
you're so excited I can show you what I
got though I was going to do this in a
separate live chat showing what I got
but oh my gosh I'm going to kill myself
trying to get over here let me show you
the sleek palettes that I got the sleek
products and I did use these yesterday

but rekindling is what that is I got the
highlighting palette and precious charms

so special and then I got the cream
contour kit in light so we're going to
be playing with this eye shadow palette
and it's going to be fun and I'm excited
I have a really fun video for you coming
up on Wednesday as well that I'm excited
about it's actually I talked about it on
periscope so I guess I can talk about
here too it was inspired by another
youtuber her name is oh my gosh it went
out of my head hmmm I can picture her
face Samantha Samantha I've to look she
uploads every single day Samantha
Samantha Samantha Oh crud on a minute
let me go into my subscriptions cuz she
uploads everyday I'll find her
but anyway so she did a video of her 7
Brandt oh there she has Samantha March
here she is she uploads every single
stinking day she did a video of 7 brands
you need to try in 2017 so I'm gonna do
my version of that and I'm really
excited about I think it came out really
good but I haven't edited it yet Jenny
says everyone have a great sunny and a
great week thank you so much you too
Jimmy oh it's 1103 I should probably pop
off here feeling pretty says March yep

have you ever tried so ever I get more
comments about zoeva than any other
brand I have never tried so ever I don't

makeup minute and from what's been
makeup and I've never tried her products
Laura just sent me a bunch of birthday

are both good brands those are both good
brands feeling pretty says it's only 8
o'clock here oh my gosh this early 8
o'clock in the morning I'm assuming but
anyway I got a pop off here Laurie says
hi Jen we ever tried lash boost by Rodan
and Fields I have no eyelashes like you
and they are starting to grow it took
about four
we see aggro kind of pricey though I've
heard good things about that product
I've never tried it no did he says Fiona
styles on sale also for seven and under
oh my gosh that's amazing
do you think the quads are good I don't
know what those are
let me say I say Ulta let's look I don't
know the quads if there's eyeshadows I
don't think I've tried her eyeshadows
Fiona my look yeah I haven't tried the
artist eyeshadow quad
seven dollars wow that is so inexpensive
I really like the light illusion prism
palette that's a really good thing if
you're going to get something from Fiona
Styles that was my favorite thing I did
that one video for Fiona Styles that was
my by far my favorite thing that I got
from them the foundation is more of a
light coverage but I did like the
foundation the matte finish foundation
concentrate but definitely I feel like
the light illusion prism palette is the
way to go on that for seven dollars are
you kidding me
this is like oh my gosh like I cannot
believe how inexpensive it is now I'm
alone nervous for Fiona Styles why why
is this so cheap what is happening why
is it so cheap okay
I mean anyway Oh Fatima says they're
discontinuing Fiona Styles at Ulta which
is why it's super cheap gotcha oh okay
Sharon says it was Oh ever coming to
Sephora I have no idea I think so it was
less expensive than Sephora net by faith
Michele says hi hi Michele and the
different Michele says it brushes are
awesome too
they're expensive bunny buy them off QVC
and a kit with a product and basically
you pay for the product in the brush is
free there you go that works okay I
should probably get going
Michelle says she has the Fiona contour
palette and it's good yeah I really like
the contour palette
well no not a contra belt the highlight
palettes the one that I have I have very
good things about the contour palette I
don't think it's up there though I think
