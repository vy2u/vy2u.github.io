the whatsit and makeup weekly live Chad
I've been getting this question a lot
lately
when is live chat when can I join live
chat so we do have a weekly live chat it
is typically every Sunday morning at 10
a.m. Eastern Time so if you are looking
to join the live chat that is when it is
every once in a while we will have a
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time live chat and the
reason for that is that not everybody
can make it at 10 a.m. Eastern the
reason why I do it at 10 a.m. Eastern is
because Sunday's are my family day so
doing it at 5 p.m. or doing it later
cuts right in the middle of my time with
my family so we do that every once in a
while to accommodate people and we
usually do it on the last Sunday of the
month so my family kind of you know we
rework our schedule we run our errands
early we run our errands late but it's
not ideal so that's why we do it so
early in the morning but anyway I have
been doing some impromptu live chats
every once in a while when I have
something exciting that I want to show
you or tell you I do do random live
chats throughout the day make sure
you're following me on Twitter to find
out when those go live because it always
feeds directly to my Twitter and it says
time to join the collective writing
another like that my Twitter is Jen
loves reviews so today we are going to
do something fun that I've never done
before that I thought would be really
cool and it's like a
choose-your-own-adventure getting ready
with me so what I have next to me are
products I've got like three four
products from each category so I've got
like primers and foundations and powders
and eyeshadow primers and brow products
and eyeshadow palettes and things like
that and then the community that's here
in live chat is going to choose which
product I use now with the eyeshadow
palettes we can kind of mix it up a
little bit so I'll probably start with
whatever the community wants and then
we'll kind of play it by ear from there
and kind of decide where it's gonna go I
just realized I didn't grab any brushes
I have them right there though I'm just
gonna have to grab them in a minute but
I thought that will be a lot of fun and
that way I can see kind of get a feel in
the community what people want to see
and that way I'm giving you the most
relevant
products at least as per the opinion of
the people that are here right now so
I'm gonna take just a moment if you're
watching this on the replay me2 take
just a moment to say hello to the people
that are here live I feel like it's
polite that when people come into my
home that I say hello to them so I'm
gonna go ahead and click over there
right now and it looks like christina
was in here first from Alberta Canada oh
my gosh isn't aren't you guys on the on
the west coast isn't it like super early
like I'm not my Canada geography is not
very good but I feel like Alberta is
like not in this time zone that gets in
a like a more Western time zone I could
be wrong on that though I could be
showing my ignorant of Canadian
geography good morning to Avril good
morning to Tabitha and good morning to
oh she says she's here all the time
fantastic hello Elijah allo AJ good
morning from me and my butch
congratulations on 100k Jen thank you so
much it's really the only subscriber
milestone that I really cared about that
I've been working toward I don't really
I try not to put a lot of stock in
numbers but the thing about 100k is you
get this cool YouTube silver play button
and that's really what I wanted I wanted
to be able to put that up in my room and
and you know I'm very excited about that
particular milestone but beyond that you
know I'm more care about like view
milestones I think are super cool but as
far as subscriber milestones I try not
to focus on those too terribly much it
is it is very nice so thank you but
anyway thank you so much to everyone
that's wish me out congratulations on my
100k I appreciate it so much
Tabitha is here Celtic what is it

have you here good morning to latina and
Julio down by the schoolyard
and amber and me me good morning to
everybody I didn't have a second to say
good morning to I want to go ahead and
get into a live chat so one other thing
that I wanted to mention and this is
mostly for people that are watching on
the replay and for people in live chat
that can come back later I would like to
do and ask me anything
um Q&amp;amp;A video so if you would like to
contribute questions to the ask me
anything Q&amp;amp;A you're gonna leave that in
the comments down underneath this video
and then I'll pick a selection of
questions there because I've gotten a
lot of new subscribers and a lot of
people that don't know me very well and
I would love to kind of tell you a
little bit more about myself so you know
who you're watching so not people in
live chat though because I can't tabitha
does save an archive of the live chat
but it's really hard to sift through and
everything so we're not gonna put it in
live chat if you are here live you're
gonna come back later and leave it in
the comments underneath this video so
Melissa says my kitty Castiel says good
morning beautiful all of it's so cool
your kitties name is Castiel is it a
white cat oh my gosh
my favorite show is supernatural and
Castiel is one of the angels on
supernatural anyway nice little twist in
the recent episodes of supernatural just
I'm just gonna leave it there because I
don't want any spoilers you know for
people that might be wanting to watch it
okay uh Kristen wants to know how my toe
is my toe is good it's healing well I
had a prompt to live chat earlier this
week and I scraped my toe pretty bad but
it's actually healing quite well thank
you for asking just a little mark now
where it's healing so thank you so much
for asking Blue Ivy hello to you says
yay Jen with coffee and Blue Ivy I've
been really enjoying your comments
lately thank you so much for commenting
on my videos Nicole is here from yeah
earning a cold I know it's early for you
thank you for being here alright I'm
gonna stop JibJab in and let's go ahead
and start with primer face primer so
these are the three phase primers I
chose that I haven't talked about on the
channel so we have the hourglass mineral
veil primer we have the NYX angel veil
and then we have the cover effects
illuminating primer so it's up to the
community whether what
you want me to use as far as foundations
you're not gonna vote on this one yet
but I just want to show you so you can
start thinking about it the Revlon youth
affects the Catrice HD liquid coverage
of this is supposed to be a dupe for the
Fenty and the even-steven by the balm
those are gonna be the ones for
foundation that are going to be the
choices so start thinking about those
while you vote for which primer all
right we've got a cover effects we've
got hourglass Nix Nix Nix hourglass Nix
FX effects NYX and FX effects Nix
hourglass hourglass
it looks like Nix is the one that's the
winner so let's go ahead and use the
next I haven't used this one yet
it is pretty much brand new this was
sent to me by Nix but I haven't used it
let's see it is white when it comes out
like that and then we're gonna go ahead
and put that on it feels extremely
silicone II I've heard this is a dupe
for some kind of primer but I forget
which one people were saying this is a
dupe for I think the worst thing was a
dupe for the hourglass if I remember
right it does feel more silicone e to me
than the hourglass it was like how do
you keep up uh well what I'm doing is
I'm being I'm kind of checking to see
I'm kind of checking to see which one I
see the most and then I'm not really
counting I'm more looking Gabrielle says
it is a super dupe for hourglass let me
put them next to each other and kind of
feel them I'm gonna put one on one side
of my hands so we can get this get this
feeling wise I don't know as far as
performance of course but we can tell
like as far as the way they feel next to
each other the hourglass is more lotion
II in my opinion at least from what I
remember and looking at them let's put
them next to each other last week I was
going like this too much with my hand it
was going too fast so I apologize people
are trying to look at swatches I'm going
like this I'll try to do better with
that but these are the two next each
other this is hourglass and this is NYX
not sure if you can see but the
hourglass is more lotion II where this
one is more thick will kind of spread it
a little bit
so this is our glass this is Nick's and
that's definitely more of a cream for
the next and more lotion for the
hourglass and their they don't feel the
same at all the Nicks is definitely yeah
they're totally different as far as the
texture I don't know as far as the
performance goes though but they're
they're completely different with the
texture just so you know the hourglass
has a little bit of iridescent to it
which is kind of weird Misa says I love
the hourglass so much I do really like
the hourglass when I first tried it the
first time I was kind of like man but I
think part of that is because I have
normal skin and I think people with
normal skin have an easier time with
primers and primers don't have to be as
picky on us as other people so um Tamm
says it to me it's not a dupe well
formula wise it's definitely not a dupe
doesn't look like a dupe doesn't smell
like a dupe doesn't feel like a dupe but
but as far as the actual wear time I
don't know to be honest okay so now
Melissa says you go to the Ulta and
Elkridge near columbia or annapolis i go
to the the Elkridge one is the one that
i go to that's where all my girls are
well I only really know one person that
worked well a couple people that work
there that I've gotten to know a little
bit okay so now it's gonna be time to
vote on the foundation that I use so
we've got Revlon we've got Catrice and
we've got the bomb and then let me show
you the powder so you can start thinking
about that so we've got photobombed by
the bomb we've got the it cosmetics CC
cream and then we've got the Wow der the
Wow door by glossier so those are gonna
be the powders but right now we are
going to be voting on what foundation
I'm gonna use so the choices are Catrice
Revlon youth effects and even-steven
those are your three choices right now
Catrice Catrice the bomb Catrice Patrice
Patrice put the bomb Patrice Patrice
Patrice it looks like it's mostly
Patrice in the bomb I see a lot of ooh
it's kind of even between those two mmm
well this is what we're gonna do this is
what we'll do we'll use both because it
looks really even between these two so
you can go
stop voting now there is a delay
moderators so not madhuri is what we
call you admin but my guess is chat
moderators there is a little bit of a
delay from my voice so they're probably
gonna go a little bit further than when
i when i do when i say to stop so no
worries if they keep voting for just a
second longer okay so we're gonna do a
half and a half half face I love that
someone someone autocorrect Lisa's
autocorrected to cat rice that's awesome
okay we're gonna do half and half and if
I'm two-toned I don't care okay so we're
gonna start with the Catrice let me go
ahead and get a brush here yeah well you
will even go with our teeth brush okay
and then we're gonna do a little bit of
this now one thing I can tell you right
away that I do not like about the
Catrice is it is extremely heavily
fragranced another thing i do not like
about the Catrice is that it is there's
only like two shades like maybe four
shades okay so there is the Catrice okay
and we're gonna put that all I forgot my
mirror a mirror would be helpful don't
you think hold on let me I have my
microphone on I don't want a microphone
to pull my whole setup down oh no I have
to choose right now between putting my
coffee on the table and putting my
mirror on the table I have not much room
let's have to have to move the coffee
here sorry coffee even voted off the
island okay so here's the Catrice this
mirror by the way is from i get asked
every time i use it it is from a brand
called simple human eye it can be
purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond with a
20% off coupon that's where I recommend
that you purchase it from if you choose
to purchase it just because you get 20%
off and it is a fantastic mirror I do
get I do have two things that I don't
like about it I don't like that it turns
off and also it turns off if I'm not
look right in front of it and also I
don't like that the battery doesn't last
a super long time I wish there was just
an on-off button like if I wanted to
just turn it off or turn it I keep it on
because sometimes it'll randomly like
stay on if I have it too close to a wall
or something but then when I'm right in
front of it it doesn't when I'm right in
front of it sometimes it doesn't stay on
okay so here in the coverage we're gonna
do two pumps of each so we'll do we'll
do two layers so here is the coverage of
the Catrice on one side it is extremely
heavily scented the Fenty is not heavily
scented if you notice the ingredients of
the Fenty it has some different like
wheels and not wheels but like um like
fruit extracts and things like that down
in the lower parts of the ingredients
I'm thinking they're doing that for a
fragrance covering if it cuz it is
basically an identical formula the
Catrice and the fenty they're very very
close up until those later ingredients
but I do feel like this one is way more
fragranced way more fragrance so that is
one coat and then we're gonna go ahead
and do the other one Amy says are you
liking that brushes that feel awkward to
use it definitely does not feel awkward
to use I was a little bit skeptical when
I first started using brushes like this
but now I really love them I feel like
they definitely leave a nice finish on
my skin and the most the thing I like
the most about them is they're fast
where I feel like with a regular brush
sometimes it comes out streaky with a
Beauty Blender you got to tap and press
in top and press and tap em press
sometimes it takes forever so I feel
like this is the fastest way to put on
foundation in my opinion quickly and
easily and having it look good you don't
have to invest in an artiste there are
so many different dupe versions of this
brush now that are just as good in my
opinion the makeup revolution ones are
not good though don't buy those but I
really like the the ones from Mota the
modal ones are excellent they do send me
them though so just so you know but I'm
just telling you even if they didn't
send them to me I would buy them and
love them let's see Nicole said from yay
or nay Nicole great YouTube channel I
love paddle brushes just a pain to clean
for cream products that is so true
girlfriend okay we're going to go ahead
and close this up and then we're going
to go into the even-steven now I have
used this a few times one thing I don't
like as it is a pot so we are looking
something that you are contaminating
with your fingertips so you want to make
sure you wash your hands right before
you use it to kind of limit the amount
of to limit the amount of bacteria that
you're getting in I mean but there's
only so much you can do you're still
gonna get some bacteria in there now you
can see the consistency of it it is
really really really thick really thick
I'm gonna blend it out it feels very
silicone II compared to the Catrice it's
also way more coverage you'll notice on
my lips you see the difference in color
covering up my pink lips
huge difference right let me put it over
here it is much more full coverage I do
have trouble with this one taking up on
me throughout the day which I do not
like I'm still trying to find the right
primer to go with it because I feel like
if I just had the right primer it would
be fine but right now it actually looks
pretty good but I find it cakes up
especially right around my nose and on
my chin it'll cake up throughout the day
but you can see the difference in
coverage I may not put a second coat of
that one on because it is it's pretty
stinging full coverage so let me show
you the difference daniel says what
about a spatula that would definitely
work that is a very smart idea and one
thing I was thinking I was you know I
think random things at random times I
was out of the shower and start to get
ready to film what's at the makeup and I
was thinking I was like you know what
you know there's little ice cream taster
spoons I bet you could take one of those
home and wash it and use that for like
potted products I think that would be
good because some things come with a
little spoon like that and some things
don't but I think that would be good you
know like a little you know just
recycled little taste your spoon from
the ice cream shop I think that'd be
cool so but anyway this one this one's
definitely thicker so let's put on
another layer of the Catrice because we
definitely have two different textures
here completely different okay and then
we'll move on because it is already 17
minutes into chat and my daughter
actually
as a friend over so I have to UM I can't
I can't stay on super late because my
husband decided to go to yoga this
morning and he's not home so it's just
me with the kids but my kids are old
enough at this point that they're um
Monica I think I have to sneeze excuse
me I'm sorry I tried to pull microphone
I probably touched it with my fingers
that one made it even worse so I
apologize for that
but yeah so they're they're old enough
they can kind of take care of themselves
for a little while but at the same time
all right so now we're building up the
coverage oh the cat race to where the
bombs was on one swipe and the shade
matching is actually pretty close off to
tell you the names of the shades in just
a second but now we've got more of a
medium to fuller coverage on the Catrice
but I can see already I don't know if
you'll be able to see it but I'm already
kicking up around my nose from the bombs
even-steven everybody sing bless you
thank you so much well this is cutest
knees I always hated my sneeze I always
thought it sounded weird I don't know I
guess you always think about yourself
like from your own perspective it's kind
of weird like thinking about your own
sneeze all right so moving on to face
powder and then I'm going to show you
the face powder choices then I'll show
you the eye primer choices because I got
to move this party alone okay so here
are the face powder choices that you're
going to vote on we have the this is
actually powder foundation from the balm
it's called photo bomb and then we've
got the it cosmetics airbrush perfecting
powder and then we've got the WoW der by
glossy ice so those are your choices
which are gonna vote on right now and
then these are the ones that you're
gonna vote on in a minute for eyeshadow
primer so we've got these none of these
are new to me but I feel like I haven't
talked about them in a while so I
brought him out this is the Mac Paint
Pot in painterly this is the Urban Decay
anti-aging primer potion and then the
essence I heart color intensifying
eyeshadow primer so that's what you're
going to vote on in a second but for
right now you're voting on and powder
that I'm going
so let's see got louder louder it
cosmetics the bomb water water water
water water water it water water Wow
okay router winds there's there's a
smattering of all the other ones but it
cosmetics definitely was a was a second
but it looks like the router is
definitely the one okay let's talk about
how I feel about this let me tell you
the first thing I don't like about this
I don't like the packaging it started
off very very cute but I have trouble
getting the powder out like when I press
on it the powder does come out some but
as it gets lower and lower it's getting
harder to get as much powder out that I
need so I don't like the packaging even
though it's cute I don't think that it's
functional I think maybe if they had
opened this up more I don't know but
then still you're still like as it gets
down lower it's not gonna come out
anymore so you know alright I am going
to use which brush should I use let's
use this big fattie here this is a big
tart brush I forget when I got this but
I got this a really long time ago and
I've been liking what I used to do is I
used to take powder and take a really
fluffy brush and put it all over my face
oh I didn't pull out concealer we're
just gonna skip concealer for today
we're just gonna skip it but what I used
to do is use a big fluffy brush and just
fluff it all over but what I've learned
is that taking a more dense brush and
then packing the powder onto the dense
brush and then packing it pressing it
into the skin seems to do better so
we're gonna do that instead and so far I
do really like the router um
do I like it better than some of my
other favorite powders no but it's still
good and you see that didn't even make a
dent on my face like as far as like I
feel like I'm constantly reaching for
more product like it just it doesn't
give me enough product so I'm actually
going to take this and kind of bang some
into the cap and then the cap is is like
this so you can't even get it like where
you want it like as far as like I don't
even know how I'm gonna get it's just
frustrating to get out and I don't think
I would repurchase it just because of
that not that I purchased it because I
didn't my friend Nancy actually bought
this for me because she
me to try it but the performance of the
actual powder is very very good it's
just I don't like the packaging the
packaging is really really annoying all
right so I've got powdered on one side
there and not that side
Elisa's like that brush is really huge I
ignore a little bit which is also
probably a losing battle against this
powder because I'm in trouble picking it
up anyway but it is a really good powder
I just don't like the packaging and the
packaging is just so annoying getting
the product out and I honestly feel like
both of these foundations are relatively
matte so and because I don't have a
willy skin I don't necessarily need a
powder over these but I did want to show
you what it looked like with the
foundation set with powder Jenny says
the router is grateful control works is
great to set lids great good to know you
know what I never even thought about
using it to set lids that's really smart
thank you so much for that this is why I
love the collective brain because I
learn a lot didn't even think about that
Julie says I want to get the peaches and
cream
I love the peach powder I love that one
but I mean it is a good powder I'm
starting I think I've said this a couple
times before I'm starting to realize
that you know you've got once you get to
something that's really really good
there really isn't anything that tops it
if something is everything you want it
to be and that's the way I feel about a
lot of these powders you know like with
the peach one with the laura mercier
with the bare minerals with the router -
the packaging they're just really good
powders for me and they're they do
everything I want them to do so is one
better than the other no not for me at
least but like the peach one it smells
like peaches so if you don't like
peaches you're not gonna want that one
okay so now let's move on to eye primer
so your choices for eye primer are gonna
be the essence the Mac or the urban
decay you can just put UD if you want
and then I'll show you brow products
brow products we've got the Anastasia
brow Wiz which I haven't talked about in
a minute the Too Faced chocolate brownie
eyebrow pencil and then we've got the
goof proof brow pencil because all I
have is like ones I've already tried it
don't really have any new ones but then
next we're gonna go into eyeshadow so
I'm excited about that so you can go
ahead and vote for the essence the Urban
Decay or the Mac
looks like Mac Mac essence Mac or essent
Urban Decay I'm gonna Kay essence
essence early KS and smack essence
essence whoa
lots of essence all right Mac essence
ebony KS and said okay essence wins okay
I can tell you right now I don't like
this eyeshadow primer don't like it I
don't like it all and let me tell you
why I don't like it I don't like it
because I find that it doesn't make my
eyeshadow last longer it's very very
thin but I haven't talked about it on my
channel before oh my gosh essence
totally won that one I haven't talked
about it on my channel before I had
people recommend it to me but for me I
feel like it does not make my eyeshadow
last longer like when I'm working on
reviews and things on I shadow products
I'll put the essence on one side and the
Urban Decay on the other and the Urban
Decay always looks better if you're
looking for a less expensive drugstore
priced eyeshadow primer what I would
recommend is the one from Ulta brand
there's one it's it's a nude shade I
need a little tiny bit more on this side
it's a nude shade and it's amazing and
it's fabulous and it's almost the exact
same formula as the urban decay and the
Too Faced shadow insurance if you look
at the ingredient deck for the Too Faced
shadow insurance and the Urban Decay
they're almost identical same with the
the one from from Ulta brand so I
definitely recommend checking that one
out I don't hate this one in that it
doesn't do anything bad but it doesn't
do what I need it to do as far as making
my eyeshadows last longer I think my it
might just be too thin if you look at it
like let me put that on then let me show
you the Urban Decay anti-aging I do love
this Urban Decay anti-aging I used to
talk about this all the time that when I
was using it religiously I I definitely
saw a decrease in fine lines on my lids
people don't believe me I have fine
lines on my lids but I do okay so if you
look at the difference in texture this
one this is the urban decay hopefully
you can see it but it's much thicker
than the essence and I think that might
be the problem with the essence that
it's just not it's not silicon e-enough
one of it's
but it's not like thick enough you can
see that that the essence is cream is I
like lotion ear is lotion your word I
don't think it is but but yeah it just
doesn't it doesn't stick Stacy says I
use NYX jumbo pencil Zoar the matte lid
lingerie is awesome as a base I've never
used the matte Liz lingerie as a base
but the the pencils are very good milk
has been a classic since the beginning
of my channel it was in my very first
video as a product that I had if you're
want to know you know start it started
from where I started from if you go back
to my very first video it is a video of
what is it my makeup bag and that was my
entire makeup collection was contained
in this one makeup bag so if you're ever
curious and what I said what I started
with that was something Julie says
higher viscosity there you go see
Julie drop in the vocabulary thank you I
appreciate you AJ says that you D
anti-aging is my favorite it is a great
primer it doesn't have any like it kind
of blends into the skin so you don't get
that it doesn't mute out discoloration
like a lot of eyeshadow primer mystery
these days well almost halfway done with
Chad and I haven't even done my brows
yet okay so we've got benefit two-faced
and a BH I'll show you the eyeshadow
palettes while we are while you're
thinking about that we've got the hood
of beauty o of obsessions which looks
like this and then we've got the don't
vote for these yet though the visi art
gold and our palette which looks the
legatees and then I did play with this
one just a little bit for getting ready
for what's up and makeup for today I
really don't like the way that it looks
on camera it looked much better in
person but this is the Pat McGrath the
mother ship palette and then the Fanta
beauty palette we don't have to stick
with one of these with these but I just
want to know which ones you're most
interested in seeing so there's the
fenty Beauty palette I haven't touched
this hardly at all so okay so let's look
and see for
brow products let me scroll up a little
bit because people already started
voting ok I'm scrolling up it looks like
to face benefit to face benefit benefit
two-faced two-faced two-faced abh to
face to face aviation a fit benefit to
face to face benefit benefit a BH it
looks like it's mostly benefit and
toothpaste so we'll do the same thing it
looks like a split between benefit and
two-faced okay so what we'll do is we'll
do one on each I will do the Too Faced
on one eyebrow and we'll do the benefit
on the other one I can tell you I really
like both of these very very much
they're very similar they both have a
spoolie at the ends see they both have
spool ease and thus bullies are very
similar and then they both have angled
tips if you look see how they're both
angled at the top which I personally
really like from my brow shape because I
have not big brows but I don't have
really tiny brows so if you have really
small brows you may find both of these
difficult to work with because they do
have a bigger base to them but if you
wanted to pick one that was a little
smaller the benefit is a little bit
smaller but both of these formulas are
great the two faced one up I just
dropped one of my cats the two faced one
does have a chocolate set so just be
aware of that I'm gonna use the
toothpaste on my right eye and then
we'll do the benefit on the other eye I
did just purchase a second round of my
Sephora
from the Sephora sale and I ended up
getting the Anastasia stencils to kind
of help me with my brow game a little
bit okay so there's the two-faced see
how fast that was really opaque syncs
right down to the skin doesn't do
anything weird sitting on top of the of
the brows nothing like that it's it's
creamy but not so creamy that it sticks
in the brow now this one takes me a
little bit longer because it's a little
bit smaller but it does pretty much the
exact same thing I know some people will
spend like 15
on their brows I am NOT one of those
people I just color it in and then I'm
done
let me see are they even enough even
enough I could stand to get my brows
done okay close enough the toothpaste
one oh you know what I didn't tell you
the foundation shades but I'll tell you
the brow shades and I'll tell you the
foundation shades I use so the benefit
one is number four and the Bret
chocolate brownie one is in deep brown
those are the shades that I use again I
like them both equally they both do
everything that I want in a brow pencil
these are my favorite brow products
these two right here are my favorites I
actually like them better than the brow
is just because the brow Wiz is I like
the shape of this one better but they do
really really well both of them I lost
the top to that one I'll find it after
we're done I'm not gonna spend your time
searching for it let me go ahead and go
back my son's out there yelling
hopefully you can't hear him so we've
got the even-steven this shade was
light/medium and then for Catrice my
shade is light beige so just so you know
I don't think either one of them are
very deep skin friendly as far as their
shade range from what I remember okay
angel says brush the map on I will if
you want me to I don't think it's
necessary but I will they pretty much
look the same and honestly like I don't
care about ever else that much but if
it's bothering you I will totally do it
there you go better sometimes I feel
like you know the beauty gurus do things
and they do them but I don't feel the
night.the need to do everything that
everybody else does you know what I mean
but I will do it though if you want me
to I will because this is
choose-your-own-adventure time okay
also I would normally put on a brow gel
but I was just I don't know I just
wanted to focus on other things today
okay so let's go ahead and let's do the
eyeshadows so we'll start with either
this is where we're going to start
we're gonna start with the visi art Jota
Fenty or we can just call this you can
call it PG or Pat McGrath oh I guess
well BPM p.m. and then I will show you
what's next after that we're gonna do
eyeliner and I can either show you the
NYX epic ink the em cosmetics eyeliner
or the Milani it looks like Houda
everybody's sayin Jota Jota busy art
Jota Jota Jota Pat McGrath busy art Rath
Jota Jota Jota Jota
there's your Jota hood everybody wants
the hood alright let's go with Jota yeah
it's overwhelming melee Jota I see some
Pat McGrath
Jota is definitely winning okay let's
start with the hood oh okay I like that
there's a nice transition shade in there
so let's go ahead and start there this
is where I forgot my brushes so I'm
gonna see if I can get my brushes
without knocking things over here okay
okay so let's start with a transition
see these brushes are super fab and this
is a Luxy brush and I don't have to stay
in the hood I can jump around maybe
we'll put a little bit of shimmer from
one of the other ones in a minute okay
and I did hear that this formula of the
hooda is different than her full-sized
palette which that drives me nuts I
really don't like that because I got
this to try her formula but if this is
not her typical formula then it defeats
the purpose of me purchasing it but that
went on super easily I could say that
that transition shade went on really
easily I'll try to get a little closer
that went on very very easily okay so
let's do hmm
you know what let's do a matte look with
this and then we'll add some shimmer
with one of the other ones so we'll pull
out this motor brush this is a domed
shadow brush from there it's not the
mythical line what is this I can't
remember all right is that good and
let's go ahead and put this one all over
the lid let's go with a nice
Maulvi movi look actually I'll just put
it right in the center there we go let's
see Shan said her boxycharm got lost in
the mail oh no she that's so sad
box of shrimps had a tough month but
these are going on really nicely very
easily the mats ok let's go for a
smaller brush ok this is from the new
Jasmine line from Luxy and we're gonna
do let's do this deeper shade let's go
into this one this one looks like fun
he's mats are nice actually I'll just
know I can I can use that here I'm gonna
use my mirror ok Jamie wants to know
what the price of the smaller Hooda
palette I forget I wish I could tell you
I honestly forget Luke got a little bit
of fallout but that might have been my
fault and I'm gonna just kind of pull
that up into the crease a little bit
sorry this is kind of far away I'm gonna
try to move up a little bit so you can
see better but I do like that it's very
pretty the prismatic motive prismatic is
what it's called took me a second
remember
okay well that's kind of cool these are
blending out really nicely like I have
no complaints about these mats so far I
do have a little bit of fallout but that
may have been my fault
yeah they're they're going on very very
nicely okay so I'm gonna kind of wipe
this off a little bit I got a towel
right here and then we're gonna go in
with this white shade actually let's do
a mix of the white with a tad bit of
this pink shade kind of mix them
together and then we'll go on the inner
corner with that kind of do let go three
color mix there that's pretty sometimes
I forget that you can mix shades
together to get the effect that you want
that you don't necessarily have to just
go with the shades that are in the
palette you can mix them you just have
to try to match them that's the only
thing is trying to match the colors so
right now we've got kind of stripy look
but I need to blend them out so they're
not quite as stripy this is just a clean
fluffy brush that's pretty I might dab
that middle shade on just a little bit
harder no I kind of like that kind of
like that the way it is we are a little
bit on the other side right here we cut
them a little bit like a little below
the line that I like I'm just gonna kind
of wait a little bit with my finger
disrobe gentle if I was doing like an
Instagram look I might spend a little
more time with it but we're just doing
everyday makeup here this is not someone
asked if it was all matte no it's not
there are three shimmer shades and I can
swatch those for you real quick
just so you can see them since I'm not
gonna be using them from this palette
that's how they look there and I'm not
going to shake my hand around like I did
before because that is not helpful there
you go Julie says Jen next time try
going in an angled wait try next time
going in and angled up from the outer
corner of your eye and not so much out
okay
Thank You Julie I appreciate that
only it says hmm you can build them but
won't repurchase oh okay so far I'm
really liking it I have no complaints
over the way that these these performed
I feel like they perform really well I
am gonna go in just a little bit more
with this this shade right here just in
the center just to build it up a little
bit because I think that's a good idea
and they definitely build and now let's
put some shimmer over top of this oak
sorry you can't see if I put the mirror
in front of your face
okay so let's find something shimmery to
put it over top what do we got in here
because I haven't used this yet
the Fenty let's see ooh you know what we
can do let's put this crazy guy over top
see this guy right here this guy's cool
and I'm just gonna use my fingertip OOP
I use the wrong one that's not what I
meant to do wrong one Jen this one right
here it's got its like pink with a gold
shift and I'm not gonna use any glitter
glue because I want to see how these
perform without glitter glue
I have heard well maybe I should use
glitter glue now thinking about it
because I have heard that you should use
a glitter glue and I should use you know
what people say is important so
hopefully you can't seem a bum bum okay
so okay I just bought this when I was
fret with my friend Nicole from yay or
nay Nicole in San Francisco I just
bought this NYX clitter glue oh no you
couldn't see my Bom Bom good cuz my Roos
were sticking out the back underneath my
shirt when it says it doesn't perform
well use glitter glue okay yeah we're
gonna use the glitter glue I haven't
compared this to the two-faced one yet
but that is on the list of things that I
want to do so we're gonna just put a
little bit of glitter glue on both sides
I did use this once and I did really
like it and I felt like it was good but
I don't know as far as comparing to the
Too Faced I'm gonna have to do a formal
test on that okay so there we go now I'm
gonna wipe off my finger
and go in with the Fenty Kirk says I
love the next glitter glue awesome
Maddie says Jen think you'll ever do a
haircare routine no probably not
probably not to be honest because I have
a really bad hair
I definitely oh whoa holy moly whoa dude
that looks really cool that's cool
why didn't they sell it with a glitter
glue because that's cool I like that
whoo okay let's do another one
let's do this one right here in the
inner corner did that one cuz we're just
having fun
that doesn't look good
that looks bad looks weird doesn't it
doesn't match I should just put it all
over but now I'm stuck going I should
have just chose one or the other and not
put them together because it looks weird
I was weird together they definitely I
don't know I guess not that bad hmm the
reddish one is just so opaque maybe if I
just blend it a little more with my
finger we'll be in good shape
okay I'm just having fun here though so
it's all good Jenna says can't find
glitter glue in Indiana what have you
tried well I haven't been able to find
the I haven't been able to find the next
one around me I got it at the next store
in San Francisco that was the only place
I could get it just because they already
don't love what I did
ooh I've got a little bit of glitter up
on my brow bone they didn't mean to go
there I'm gonna put a little bit of like
this one right here in the inner corner
just to see what happens for fun I don't
like that either but it's fun sure we're
gonna be a disco ball today apparently
I'm gonna take my kids to the trampoline
park looking like a disco ball I'll be
like what is this lady doing walking in
like this but it's so fun just says that
looks fine on camera cool man
adrià says NYX Claire glue is at Target
it's not at my target it's not at my
target it's not my Ulta it's not
anywhere they don't sell it around me
it's very weird so so far my thoughts on
this are that it is a fun toy is it
going to be for everyone absolutely not
because it's loud it's very very very
loud very loud the hood ah I had no
problem with the math I thought they
perform beautifully can't speak on
lasting power of these this is not a
full review because it's gonna take me a
lot longer to do a full review on this
stuff but as far as first impressions
I'm enjoying both of them so I'm
Josephine says saw your video was
Stefanie loved at all thank you so much
Elise says Walgreens girl I have looked
everywhere I've looked everywhere I
think next house like a ban on it being
in my area or something
oh my eyeliner spell off okay we gotta
hurry it up because it is I'm supposed
to get off here in 15 minutes and I
still have lots left to do okay so four
eyeliners a gabrielle says a very
expensive toy yes yes a very expensive
toy I'm totally with you so we'll do the
it's either em cosmetics Nick's or
Milani and then after that I just have
two mascaras I haven't tried this one
yet the Physicians Formula Oregon wear
mascara or I also have the one from
collab this is the from Sally Beauty
that the influencers a bunch of
influencers help to design their collab
line so that's gonna be from mascara
we're gonna hold off on that for a
minute and you're gonna tell me em e/m
mix or Milani what do you guys think I
see em I see NYX I see Milani that does
not help em Nix Nix Nix Nix M Milani Nix
Nix Nix Milani Nix Nix M Milani Milani
Nix Nix Nix Nix looks like mostly next
Milani
Nix Nix Milania Milania Milania collab
we're not gonna do the club yet Milani
Milani now I'm seeing all this Milani I
was seeing next first and now I'm seeing
ani it looks like a tie between Knicks
and Milani I thought it was gonna be I'm
cosmetics okay well let's do one on one
eye and one on the other eye so we'll
put the UM Cosmetics Joe and we'll do
the we'll start with the Milani now this
is a little bit difficult for me to do
so funny this is a little bit for me
difficult for me to do with one hand
holding the mirror so I'm just gonna go
ahead and do my best but this one I do
really like it is one of those dip
liners so you have to worry about
getting the right amount of product on
your brush you can definitely overdo it
and put too much product on the brush so
you just have to make sure you kind of
wipe it around the edges but you can see
it's very very very black it does stay
wet for a little while so if you have
hooded eyes you might want to keep your
eye Khanna closed for a little bit so
that it doesn't um so that it doesn't
transfer up but it is a really nice
liner I've been really enjoying this I
do think that I was given this by Milani
at some point just so you know but I'm
not affiliated with Milani I don't think
I'm even on their PR list actually I'm
like 99% sure I'm not but Ojai wants to
know if I've tried the Fendi glitter
liner I haven't but yeah so far really
really liking it the lasting power is
really good I haven't done a wing with
this so I can't tell you like I like to
tell you whether if I accidentally rub
the side of my eye which I do all the
time whether it would smudge or not but
I haven't done a wing with this so I
can't speak to that
alright the NYX epic ink is epic angel
says don't shake the NYX the ink spills
out really you know what exactly what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna shake it because
I want to see if it's gonna happen to
mine let's say okay so far not happening
to mine but that does not mean it won't
biased what did you see
alright so let's go ahead and let's do
this one but this is a fabulous fabulous
island
I like it just as much as my cat Monday
oh this was sent to me by next but again
I don't think I'm on their PR list so
like this is not sponsored or anything
they've never paid me anything but it's
really good now the Milani one is more
mad looking at them next to each other
Milani is definitely more mad well this
one hasn't dried down all the way I
should give it a second to dry this
stuff was like I was gonna say shake it
up but I have heard other people having
issues with this my issue with this I
don't know if you can see but we've got
like see there's like little hairs I'm
not sure if you can see that when I've
put it in the cap it has brought these
two little hairs down and that's not
good
that's my only complain about this is
that the cap will it can damage the
brush if you're not super careful
putting it in so just be careful this is
the NYX epic ink it is super phablet the
first time I used this I was like oh my
god like freaking out absolutely
freaking out because it was amazing okay
so let me look at them next to each
other my Islander application on this
side is not amazing Ashley says my epic
ink started feathering on me Oh No Oh No
alright I'm sorry to hear that I
definitely did not do a good job with
the next one let me go back in a little
bit and fix the side here because it's
like wrinkling up on my wrinkles my
eyelids are not super taut it like
didn't fill it in but it's definitely
the Milani is more matte well this one
isn't mad it's more of like a satin kind
of finish LexA says mine spills
everywhere I have heard the same thing
but this one is not doing that for some
reason so I don't know Elise says I had
the same issue so I cut those small
crazy bristles off that's really smart I
should do that but this one's super fab
and then who is that just as mine
feathers - oh wow Lucas says have you
tried the em cosmetics one I'm really
loved to know about the revamp cuz I
love the old line it's fine I would
honestly compare the two I think that
they're both pretty good if I had to
choose between the two I would choose
the NYX and the Knicks is much cheaper I
do like the formula just a little better
on the NYX because I feel like it
doesn't smudge as easily as the M the M
is good though it is good
but this one is
better in my opinion alright so let's go
into the mascara and you know well
should we even vote on this one because
we're running out of time we only have
ten minutes left you know what I'm not
even gonna have a guy's vote on this I'm
just gonna do one on one side of one on
the other and kind of give you my first
impression of this and kind of an
opinion on this I do want to do a full
review on the collab line I would love
to do that this week that would be ideal
okay alright sorry that was the mother
of the little girl that's over okay so
this is I've never used this this is the
Physicians Formula Argan wear mascara it
looks very very dry very dry oh I didn't
close up my glitter glue oh you know
what I was gonna do the vamp stamp first
show you guys the vamp step Stephanie
Nicole gave me a vamp stamp and I wanted
to show you because I'm really having
fun with it I wish they made one just a
little bit smaller because I feel like
this is the kitten which is supposed to
be the smallest one I feel like even
this one is a little big for me alright
so I'm just gonna show you and I'm gonna
point it a little bit further down I'm
trying to find my favorite angle on this
BAM but I do like it it's just it's a
little bit bold of a wing for me and
they need one like half the size Maddie
says super chunky and dry oh man maybe I
don't know I mean it's been sitting in
my drawer for awhile so it's possible
that it just dried out in the tube I
just never got around to testing and I
got it in one of those holiday kits last
year and I never got around to testing
it so it might just be BAM hopefully
they match boom
seriously that is so fun I love that it
works I just wish it was a little small
the VAM seems fun it's really fun I
don't even feel like I need to fill it
in I think it's looking good okay
so we'll try this I might just end up
with the collab on both sides Julie says
you need a baby vamp I know right I can
tell you that the yeah this is this is
not I think that the the product is just
old I don't think this is gonna work the
fancy is already transferring above my
crease no no this isn't terrible but I
think that it's old not that it's full
bacteria or anything because it's
brand-new but I think it's just I let it
sit too long so I think this one's done
I think I've to throw it away that is
such a bummer
let's go into the collab all right let
me tell you a little bit about the
collab so this is the weird little dinky
wand which is very odd it is beautiful
to go on I'm really enjoying it the way
that it goes on what I'm not enjoying is
the way that it comes off now when I
first started putting this on when I
well when I first took it off for the
very first time oh it's clumping really
bad this is why I like to do a longer
review of mascaras because it's really
clumping and I don't remember it
clumping this bad before but anyway
taking it off it kind of flakes off and
it's kind of difficult to remove not
super difficult but kind of flakes off
so I thought oh maybe it's a tubing
mascara because it flaked off like a
tubing mascara but Chunming mascaras
remove with just hot water and this does
not remove it just hot water you do need
some kind of makeup remover or something
a wheel-based remover for it to work but
so far I love the effect of it it is
clumping really bad today for some
reason though but every time I've used
this before
it didn't clumped a little bit but now
my lashes look super clumpy when I do
the full review I'll get up super close
so you can see
I'll get up close now but the camera
quality on my on my laptop is not nearly
as good as on my regular camera so you
won't be able to see as much but I'm
thinking about doing this review this
week because I'm totally ready to do it
the cost of it its drugstore prices but
I don't remember the exact price I've
never had a tubing mascara flake on me
you know what I'm saying is in the
removal process when you take it off you
know how the little flakes kind of fall
down that's what I'm talking about like
how it like to the tubes come off you
know any mean like it looks like it like
little flakes of air coming off like
pieces of it are coming off that's the
way this looks like when it's being
removed but it's not achieving mascara
and it's kind of difficult to get off
like I feel like I have to go in with my
my oil based makeup remover more than
once in order to get it off it's not a
deal breaker but it's just not my
favorite as far as the removal of it
Stef says I love blank me too me too
Melissa says I've always had issues with
tubing mascaras Ellie says I love the
wet and wild mega length waterproof in
the purple tube it's amazing and $2
fantastic Debra says apparently $12.99
thank you so much for that Debra I
appreciate appreciate it sherry says
because it's obvious from the cloud
videos that it's all rehearsed in stage
these people were not involved in the
production of development whatsoever
they just get to share their name that
would make me really sad if that were
true sherry because there are a couple
of influencers involved that I think are
amazing and I really respect so that
would make me really sad if that were
true I would hesitate to say something
like that personally just because I
don't have evidence of that and I don't
know that would make me really sad I
would be disappointed in that but anyway
so as far as the mascara goes I feel
like it gives me a lot of volume it
gives me good length let me get up real
close so you can see hopefully you can
see mmm there's a delay so it's hard for
me to tell you but again when I do the
full review you'll be able to see it
better than what I'm showing you but
overall I do like it it's just a removal
process I don't particularly like that
much okay you could see it a little bit
it's pretty good Blue Ivy says vamp
stamp I think about $20 yeah I think
that sounds about right
but it's good okay let's go ahead in
- let's do cheat well yeah let's do
cheeks I didn't get any blush because I
wasn't sure where we were going with the
eyes whether we were gonna go warm or
cool so it looks like we wet warm so let
me go ahead and grab a couple blush
choices I didn't know where we were
gonna go okay so let me grab a few there
we go okay these I think will match I'm
gonna change my shirt because my shirt
is gray and I'm gonna change my shirt to
be something warmer but okay so we've
got the essence and blush up we've got
the gala for Nia by benefit and then the
Too Faced Papa don't peach were the ones
that I feel like are kind of similar
I'll kind of open them up so you can see
them so that'll be the blush choice I
didn't give you these ahead of time so
these are your blush choices you can go
ahead and start voting we're starting to
run out of time only have three minutes
left so this will be the last vote Susan
says Jen you look amazing your skin is
fantastic and you look like you're
melting away
what's your seat of melting away is that
a good thing
I don't know lots of people saying
essence to face essence California
essence essence California to face
California essence oh my goodness it's
all over the place California essence
essence California essence looks like
between the gala for Nia and the essence
benefit since to face California net
okay so let's do okay let's do one on
each side because I think they swatch
close enough let me swatch them both
next to each other so you can see okay
they are slightly different so on my
finger here this is the benefit
California this is the essence blush up
this is the shade heatwave and this was
sent to me by essence and this was sent
to me by benefit just so you know you
see if we can see yeah there there is a
slight difference so the bottom one is
the essence and the top one is the
California but we're just gonna go for
it and we're gonna put them both on one
on either side because you know we're
daring like that so let's start off with
the benefit California I do like this
blush the overspray that was on there
there was a silver overspray it's gone
so just so you know it doesn't stay
there
but it is a really pretty blush I do
like it a lot I love the essence too I
mean I can't wait to show you that one
that one's beautiful essence is
definitely underrated in their blushes I
think part of it is because they don't
have enough shades
okay I'm gonna use kind of let me wipe
this off on my towel just kind of try to
get this off yeah I've got some lip
choices actually I'm just gonna put on
the lips at this point I'm just I'm just
out of time if I didn't have my my
daughter's friend over I would give you
guys choice over everything else but I
gotta hurry up and finish this is the
essence you see how pretty that went on
like super fast you just have to make
sure use a light hand with the essence
because it it definitely can go to clown
face pretty quickly but it's beautiful
and the lasting power is fantastic so
there's the essence and there's the
benefit California and so the somebody
just you know on the street or whatever
they're not gonna be able to tell the
difference between the two even though
they are not tubes they're not exact
dupes but they're close they're
definitely close so again this is on
heatwave by essence and I personally
really like both of them a lot okay so
for highlighter I'm gonna go ahead
because I haven't tried this out a lot
and I don't really know what to do with
this
this is the cover effects halo
holographic drops I'm just gonna put
these on as a highlighter I know there's
lots of ways you can use this I need to
watch some tutorials on how people use
this so AAA bee says so without the
overspray California has no golden sheen
correct that is correct
there is no golden well no it's peach
it's a peach blush yeah don't count on
that pretty gold to stay because it goes
away alright so let's try this because I
have like I really need to watch
tutorials on this because this product
very much confuses me so that's what it
looks like on the hand sorry I didn't
mean to just hit the camera oh my gosh
it's been an hour I need a hurry oh I
spent too much time on the base
and there it is kind of blended a little
bit not pretty it may look a little
weird with this but I don't care because
I want to show you it anyway because I
want to play with it see that looks
beautiful to me I love that can you see
that I think that looks so pretty it
gives like a little tiny bit of a pink
pinkish purple shift to it it's
definitely not iridescent on my cheek
but it's close and you really only need
the tiniest little bit to give that look
that it's so pretty
it's not as loud as I thought it would
be and one thing I like about these
versus the powder ones is it kind of
melts into the skin where the powder
ones really set on top it's really
pretty see I can get closer so you can
see it's very pretty
use a sponge someone said I think I'm
past that but I will have to definitely
take that advice on the next time I use
it just because I have to be done okay
so we're gonna skip contour because we
don't have time I did want to show you
these lipsticks these were sent to me by
my friend Nancy I just got a Nancy sends
me stuff don't be mad at me don't be mad
at her she's amazing these are from a
brand called color the world she sent me
a bunch of these and I am so excited
about these lipsticks I don't know the
price point on them but they are just
beautiful and they feel amazing
so this one is the shade GN Oh kind of
put that up here so we've got GN oh and
then this one is called Huntress and I
might use that one because it's kind of
nude and then this one is called kisses
I think this one's oh no that one's a
nude too but they're just the packaging
is so stinking cute this one is called
dreamer this one's definitely going to
be a no for today we're going to put
that one away but I have worn that
before it's beautiful and then this one
is called foxy and this one's gonna be a
new for today - it's like a reddish
shade but I really like this formula a
lot so we're gonna go with one of these
nudes let's go with this one
this
one is called Huntress and then I want
to top it
they're just so hydrating they feel
really good they're very smooth there's
no long lasting power or anything like
that so don't don't think they're gonna
last forever but they're really nice
hydrating lipsticks they just feel
really good and for me on my lips I just
want comfort I don't care about the
lasting power as much as I care about
just being comfortable I don't like
being able you know said this a million
times so you probably are tired of me
saying it but I don't like I'm weird
with textures on my face I don't like
things that are uncomfortable in my face
these are so incredibly comfortable
they're almost like lip balms but there
are opaque lipsticks and they're
wonderful over top I'm going to throw
this milk makeup this is the holographic
lip gloss this one is in the shade Mars
I've showed the how the one that's a
little bit more iridescent in before but
I've never showed this one it kind of
reminds me of the fenty eye shadow that
I have on just a little bit where's the
pigmentation on this it is there it
might be my lighting but it's it's a
nude shade it's a nude shade so that's
that's the the pigmentation is there
it's just it looks like a lip color
that's why it looks like there's no some
people are saying there's no
pigmentation but there is it's just it's
a nude shade so now I feel bad because I
feel like I'm not doing it I'm not doing
it justice here let me show you like a
darker color so this one is in the shade
foxy let me show you that on my hand so
you can see the pigmentation so they're
just nice they're just really nice I
really avoid them I'm sorry you can't
really see it it's my camera too I think
it's just a very nude lip exactly
exactly thank you John all right I'm
gonna put this on over top and in person
you can really see it a lot more
well my camera on my laptop is not
fabulous
so there's with the holographic chopper
well it says holographic when it's not
you just got a little tiny bit
I can swatch the lipsticks for you I
just have to hurry because I'm not
really supposed to be on anymore
this is kisses so there's kisses Jamie
says she thinks I should put foxy on I'm
not really feeling comfortable that like
I feel like it's gonna be too much
this is GMO GMO GN oh there you go just
a little note about the Fenty glosses
Jenny said I had on this fancy gloss and
what's up and makeup this week and you
can't even see it I was so disappointed
okay and then let's do this one dreamer
there there they're just very very
hydrating you can see they're definitely
not matha just super hydrating okay and
then that's it I think I feel like I
need to add something my lower lashline
real quick so let me just bring off the
visi art gold an hour real quick and I
just want to add a little bit to my
lower lash line because I feel like I'm
laughing there and I'm just gonna do a
little bit let's do this shade down here
from the visi art and just put that down
here because I feel like I just want a
little bit a something something like
looking at myself and my finished look I
don't like that I don't have something
down there oh no I just scratched it a
little bit with the back of my brush
okay that makes me feel a little better
okay so that is it for the finished look
I hope you guys enjoyed that I would
love to know what you thought of that
because I could definitely do one of
these in the future
now looking there in the camera I'm
starting to agree with the people that
think I need to put on a deeper lip
color because I really do think it's a
little bit too nude
let's do foxy let's just do it let's
just go for it and now I'm layering
lipstick over a gloss which probably
isn't the best idea
it's a mess it's a mess the kids are
getting restless I can hear them they're
like what are you doing okay let's start
over with the lips
Cassandra wants to know if the busy art
is worth it I have no idea I just got it
in the mail I haven't used it yet oh my
gosh that's so bright that looks
terrible to me I review like I look like
a clown do I look like a clown I feel
like I look like a clown I have to look
at that look and see how it looks on the
camera I seriously feel like I look like
a clown I just have to get I don't know
I'm them camera it doesn't look bad but
in person I look ridiculous in my
opinion it looks fine on camera so what
I'll do is I'll leave this on and then
when I go off camera I'll pick something
else like camera it looks fine all right
I'm gonna go ahead and pop off here
because the natives are getting restless
but I appreciate you guys so much for
being here I don't forget to come back
on the replay and leave a and ask me
anything question down below now that
I'm not teaching I'm more free to answer
all kinds of questions so I am going to
be doing a video on that not this week
but probably next week
so make sure you ask questions there so
that I can share a little bit more about
myself for those that are curious what
else do I want to tell you this week I
have my prism Anasazi a Beverly Hills
prism palette review I would love to do
collab that would be amazing I don't
know if that's gonna happen or not I'm
really not sure about the other content
on this bit on this week I haven't
filmed anything else yet I just filled
my Anasazi a prison palette review
haven't filmed anything else so I have a
lot of ideas of things I want to do it's
just kind of what I have time to do to
see but thank you guys so much I hope

choose-your-own-adventure getting ready
