angle is not my favorite just so you
know the sound is actually not too
terrible on the on the iPad but the
angle is really really really bad like
really bad and I do apologize I'm having
a lot of issue with the YouTube encoding
software YouTube live streaming if you
do not know is atrocious
the way that it's set up they are so not
functional it was working for a long
time I updated my Mac and now my
software is no longer working so I tried
to do a new software that wasn't working
so now I'm on my daughter's iPad I will
try to fix this I will talk to YouTube
support and everything and see if I can
fix this for the next time we go live
but thank you to everybody for your
patience this morning if you've been
waiting I apologize for the delay I was
hoping because I uninstalled the
software and reinstalled the new version
I thought it was going to work
but it didn't so yeah so that's what's
happening and then I had trouble
figuring out how I was gonna get this
not to look like it's looking up my nose
and you're still looking at my nose and
I do apologize for the angle but I can't
get it any higher than where it is right
now for various reasons that I won't
bore you with so let's just go into the
chat thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it today we are going
to just have a free-form chat but I
figured I would show you a couple of
different things like for example this
right here this was sent to me by hush
which is the website that sells bad
habit and it is the aura palette and as
you can see there are some similarities
to the Anasazi of Beverly Hills prism
palette so I figured we would do a
little swatch comparison of this I am
doing a full review on this line I'm
gonna be doing this me I'm hoping it can
go up this week because it's gonna be a
lot of work but I'm gonna be putting it
this head the the bad habit stuff head
to head with the products that I feel
are extremely similar like the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills modern renaissance
palette and the the subculture palette
I'm gonna put if I figure out which ones
I have
you know that dude well I guess they're
like dupes I can call them dupes
girlfriend girlfriend boyfriend they're
dupes okay as far as the the way that
they tried to make them dupes they look
like dupes I mean that's you can't even
get more obvious than this one they'd
even barely move around the shades for
this one so so yeah and then I'm gonna
give you my opinions because I do feel
like that bad habit will be a great
brand to try out for some people and it
is definitely not going to be a good
brand to try out for other people this
again this was sent to me but they're
not paying me in any way that's not the
way that they work they basically they
send out PR and if you want to do a
video you can do a video if you don't
you don't have to but there's no money
involved in that
I do have an affiliate code that I will
be putting I think in the description
yeah I'll put it down on underneath this
video once the video renders I'll put it
down there and it'll be on the other
video and I do get a small Commission if
you buy stuff but honestly like I'm not
gonna like my Commission is not worth
you buying something that you don't like
that would make me feel awful if I made
money off of something you didn't like
because I wasn't honest so just so you
know I'm still gonna tell you everything
I think about it it doesn't even matter
if there's a commission code down there
I mean I don't I don't need that my
integrity is worth way more than a
little bit of Commission on a you know
$14 eyeshadow palette so anyway so we're
gonna be talking about that I've also
got some other things that have recently
come into my collection
I can't unfortunately I can't go back
and say hi to people because they're the
chat here doesn't work like that so I
can't say hi like I normally do Megan
says bad habit is a hundred percent
worth it and Gigi hello she says you're
always honest with your opinion yes and
Gigi we know this but new friends may
not know so that's why I want to make
sure that I I clear a PHY that maybe
says she loves my Christmas decor this
actually lights up but the way that the
plug is I can't reach it to plug it in
and I don't know how it's gonna look
i I'm not a good decorator I'm not a
very good decorator I've been working on
trying to get better at that I really
like my little house I think he's cute
but I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this
set up over here
Elizabeth is here she's any subscriber
thank you so much and Chrissy says she
loves my videos thank you so much
let's go ahead and get into the swatches
of this I love it too and it actually
lights up but I don't have batteries for
it I have to go get some batteries so
okay so this is the aura palette let's
do a little bit of swatching so we'll do
four here this is phenomenon awakening
ethereal and soul they actually feel
quite nice and again this is just
swatches so you know we'll leave a
little space for the Nastasia palette
it's just finger swatches it's not an
indication of of quality you know
overall I mean you definitely need to
try them on the eyes let me make sure I
do the matching ones okay so we're gonna
do lucid Eden dimension and pyramid this
is my first time watching these so this
one here the first one is from the aura
palette by bad habit in the second one
is honest Asya so this is bad habit this
is a Nastasia bad habit or Nastasia bad
habit anastacio bad habit anastasiya and
a wrinkle from my shirt but the finger
swatches look pretty good I mean the the
one here this one lucid by anastasiya I
believe was meant to be more of a topper
so that's why it's kind of sheer I did
do a full review over the prison palette
I was not the biggest fan of it I know a
lot of my subscribers we're not happy
that I wasn't the biggest fan of it but
I have to tell you how I really feel I
can't just you know go based on what I
think people want to hear I have to go
and what I really think these actually
feel very nice compared to other bad
habit palettes that I've that I've tried
cuz I have true that looks kind of came
off chunky there see they don't blend
down a little bit because I was having a
little bit of trouble with the the
quality of the stuff from bad habit I
mean it was fine you could create the
same looks but like it was fading and
all that stuff malory will do the white
test yes bad habit is cruelty for it yes
they are
okay so I believe this is supposed to be
eternal and then sphere and then lore
and unity okay okay with these I do feel
like that the Anastacio ones look a
little bit better so again we have the
bad habit a BH bad habit a BH bad habit
a BH bad habit a BH I feel like with the
first ones they were a lot closer with
these four I feel like they are the a BH
ones especially like the the yellow here
the ones fear I feel like the a BH one
looks stronger Laura's a beautiful shade
that's one of my favorite ones in the
palette so we'll see about that let me
get my towel for white test I don't
think I have any clean towels in here I
have no clean towels in here I ran out
of clean towels I have to get um a new
one so okay and the reason why I do this
people that are new get confused it's
not for a genuine it's just a little bit
of additional information it's not um
you know when absolute it's just I mean
I'm wiping it off anyway I might as well
show you but when I shot a shadow phase
down it can kind of stain the skin a
little bit which makes it look like it
has a longer lasting power and you can
also kind of see the undertones of the
shadow to see whether as you blend it
maybe it'll turn gray or turn a
different color or whatever so you can
see they all last pretty much the same
through the wipe test
they're pretty identical except for you
can see a little bit more of course of
that shade phenomenon from bad habit
more than the a BH 1 because the a BH 1
is more of a topper but yeah really
impressive as far as the undertones
looking almost the same they're almost
the same there's another confusion and
I'll dress this more when I get into the
full review is that you know the
difference between a counterfeit and
doop counterfeits are bad and scary and
awful like don't ever buy a counterfeit
a counterfeit product would look exactly
like this and it may say a na s ta Zi a
but other than that it might look
exactly the same and on the inside you
know it would look exactly the same
maybe there'll be some misspellings and
it would be spits a straight-up knockoff
where it's not it like Lync knockoff
purses and things like that where
they're trying to pretend like they're
the real thing when they are actually
fake this is not that yeah and made with
cat poo exactly she Diaries exactly this
is not a knock like a knock off in that
sense this is a dupe palette so this is
made legitimately by copying someone
else's idea in my opinion you know that
they they've kind of you know been
inspired we're gonna say they've been
inspired by this and they've created a
brand new product a lot of the fake
stuff people are saying is found on eBay
yes absolutely
yeah this is more of an imitation so I
want to make sure that we're clear about
that because last time I talked about
this brand people were a little bit
confused about why I was talking about
something that could have rat poop in it
and that's not what I'm talking about
woods so Jonesy love says hushed and
delivery times aren't that long that's
awesome okay so let's go into the last
ones let's finish this up let's do keep
going in the same order and then we'll
talk about some other things Valerie
says in line to catch register for day
200 she's at a supernatural convention
I'm so jealous
okay so let's go into vibe ecstasy
they're extremely so I mean look at that
they're extremely soft this thing's
crazy this is their brand new one okay
I still have little remnants of the old
shadows on there again I'm gonna do a
better job of this when I do the full
review the review holy moly
that's crazy but I did want to show you
just because I needed something to show
you that I thought you would find
interesting
good morning Shirley how are you so
that's the bad habit the aura palette
and then we'll go into parallel and
throne which is my face
Eve and then Saturn and Osiris so this
is the ABH
there's definitely oh did I do that
wrong no whoa the throne looks totally
different next to that I actually kind
of like the bad habit one better as far
as the tone it's more green so I don't
know if you can see that but those the
one from bad habit is definitely more
green where the one from oh it's more
complex the wine the Anastasio one it
kind of shifts from green to purple if
you can see that there's a green to
purple shift there where the one from
bad habit is more to straight-up green
so the one from ABH is definitely more
complex and then here it looks like the
one from the aura palette is a little
chunkier it's like a little thicker and
a little chunkier where this one is a
little more soft the one from ABH
and then we've just got what let me say
let me go back into the Oracle I think
we've only got two more shades radiates
Morgan says the find a bad habit shadows
swatch well but they don't perform well
on the eyes and that's kind of what I'm
without giving away the entire review
these are the last two I'm kind of
feeling the same way in that whoa holy
moly look at that black that they they
do swatch well and I feel like that when
you put them on the eye you can get a
really beautiful look but then they fade
really fast but this one seems different
I'm gonna have to wear this on my eyes
today because I was supposed to film
this tomorrow I don't know if I'm be
able to film tomorrow because this one
definitely feels different
all right so let's do I think this was
supposed to be Spinks radiated Sphinx
Sphinx and then obsidian and I really
didn't like that shade so that's the abh
and that's the bad habit
so again bad habit abh bad habit abh bad
habit abh bad habit abh bad habit abh
bad habit and ABH
yeah I mean the swatches are definitely
gorgeous from this they feel very soft I
mean they feel amazing to touch them I
need to put them on my eyes though let's
do the white test and then we'll move on
to talking about other things
hi blue ivy how are you the black did
swatch really nice that's like ink but
the thing about an inky black is that
sometimes they can be kind of difficult
to work with they really that black
really did make a mess everywhere didn't
it you can't even really see it off to
keep that in mind for when I do the the
full review I need to just go one way
because I spread the black this way you
can't even really see but lasting power
looks really good on all of them really
does and that was definitely not a
critique of the prism palette was the
last of my lasting power was fine I just
didn't like the shimmer shades in the
prism I felt like a BH could do better
on that so we'll see Jacqueline says
overly black pimp overly pigmented black
shadows intimidate me yeah me too I find
them a little bit difficult to work with
I'd rather more of a dusty smoky black
rather than a super pigmented black Stef
says I don't mind a grey black because
just like if or if you add black to
something it completely changes the look
where all you see is black yes and I
feel like with a lighter pigmented black
you can it just kind of darkens the
whole look rather than just gives you
black as a color you know what I mean
okay
I had to block somebody okay oh good
Michelle got into all right so I got him
I got him Michelle I mean I Banshee muse
I got him in Michelle god I've got him
together okay the next thing I wanted to
show you let's say Melissa says Jen if
you looked at the palette and the
ingredients of the palette I can do that
we're gonna do all of this you know when
I do the full review but just I can
eyeball it real quick mica titanium
dioxide which is pigment ethical
palmitate which is a preservative talc
synthetic florica pipe floor I don't
know how to say that but that's
synthetic mica
same ethic own and it's a very simple
formula but I mean it looks like a
decent formula I mean there's nothing in
here that's standing out to me is not
good there's ferric ferrocyanide so it's
not Lips safe oh that's for the shimmer
shades let me look at the matte shades
talc mica again the synthetic flora
flicker go play I can't say that word
yeah I mean nothing standing out as
being bad in any way pretty simple
formula so we're gonna go into more of
that later all right the other thing I
wanted to show you I shadow wise which
I'm super excited about were the singles
that I got from coloured raine oh my
gosh
wait till you see these it's amazing
Rena says hush takes forever to ship
that was the opposite that someone else
had oh my gosh Jonesy says the bad habit
Athena palette is much warmer tone than
then the hood of desert dust palette
that's good to know because I don't own
the hooded palette I don't know where
the trolls come from I don't know how
they find it I really don't there are a
lot of trolls in here today thank you
for your patience those of you that are
here live so this is the shade flashing
lights this is what I had on my eyes for
what's been makeup today look at this
this is in same insane do that like are
you kidding me and that's the way it
applies to the eye and that's how it
looks all day long like it's sick it's
ABS oh I wish there was something we
could do with I don't know what is going
on with the trolls I really don't okay
there's that one I have a little bit of
stain on my finger from the last one
this is called side of Olives I had this
in my outer corner for the UM for what's
of a makeup today do you see this thing
could that unbelievable right okay and
then we'll do this one which is called
Bay Breeze I got these with um on Black
Friday and I'm so happy with my purchase
so happy like honestly I like white and
have a review channel I think I would be
done I don't think I would need I would
just need these this one isn't quite as
intense as the other ones the Bay Breeze
it's a little bit more subtle but it's
beautiful layered on top of this one I
was feeling the green vibe when I uh I
was felling the green vibe when I
ordered this but I also ordered one of
these oh no no no no come back come back
where'd you go there anymore
over oh my gosh I'd be so upset if I
crushed this oh my gosh my hair looks
atrocious I can't even I can't even with
my hair this is called shortcake oh my
gosh okay it's more orange than I
expected I expect it to be a little more
pink but that's okay I will still use
this just beautiful beautiful yeah shout
out to the moderators for doing an
awesome job kicking out all the trolls
there's like I've seen like six at least
six trolls in here in the past five
minutes unbelievable thank you so much
okay yeah it is it is sort of peachy
it's like a peachy orange but it's still
very orange I wasn't expecting I was
expecting it to be more because it's
called a shortcake I was expecting it to
be more pink but that's okay I'll still
use it and the pigmentation is insane so
I wanted to show you that I also got
this here that was your color of rain
this is colored rain as well this is
their lovelyz palette do a quick swatch
of this I had to pick which one I was
gonna get i swatched this over at
stephanie Nicole's house and I was like
mm-hmm I need that in my life I wore
this all over my lid yesterday and was
so pretty don't you more love love and
romance that one this one feels gritty
which Stephanie was explaining to me
means that there's just a ton of pigment
in there just really really pretty this
one is gorgeous I can imagine this being
beautiful on like super deep skin that
would be insane all these would be
insane on that but oh so pretty so
pretty so anyway there's that I want to
show you that they also sent me this is
the Athena palette I feel like they
already sent
to me feel like they they already sent
one of these to me so if they did then
this was definitely be forgiven but I'm
not gonna open this because I think that
they already sent this to me but I have
but I have the boxes actually I'll check
and see real quick because I have the
boxes right here I have inferno
I have Royals I have a sustainable oh I
have Aphrodite I think that was what I
was thinking I was Aphrodite
I have paradise I have rose a which is
the Nicole Guerrero I have retro love
which was the subculture and I have
sugar which is the palette so no this
must be the new one that's legit for the
hooda but I don't have the hodo I don't
have that one
quota I don't have that one so I think
open it up and show you
Athena sold out quickly and couldn't
grab it let me open it up for you
these are bought off of a website called
hush the shop hush show you what it
looks like this one is straight up you
have to be really soft with that one
straight up glitter but that's what it
is in the hooda palette I think too it's
just like a loose literal Mouse that's
really not packed very well oh I wish
they put a little more dimethicone in
that to pack it in there whoo
I'm gonna do these duo Chrome's real
quick this is gleam and epic those are
pretty well I got a little bit of
another shade in there those are really
pretty oh my gosh okay I'm gonna have to
play with this to see that the problem
is is I only have two eyes I can't play
with everything I can't I just can't I
mean so like some of those like the
Athena palette I'll probably just swatch
it and not review it just so people can
see it get that off of their horses in
Maryland hello neighbor
hi Felicia I just got the Hooda lip
contour set from Sephora
very glad for good things about that
very cool that's awesome I also wanted
to show you where's my box of stuff
there it is
this was sent to me by my friend Cynthia
I was helping her just just talking to
her about her channel and stuff her
channel will be linked it was linked in
the old video it will be linked down
below once this video rendered it's one
on Cynthia a but there's something
before it hold on I have it right here
maybe pretty Cynthia a pen may be pretty
Cynthia ate that she had give it she had
an extra one of these for some reason so
she sent this to me which I thought was
really really sweet of her
so again paint me pretty Cynthia a as
her channel and I've heard great things
about these I know raw Beauty Christy
loves starburst swatch those real quick
there's so many video ideas in my head
of things that I want to do like just
comparing highlighters because it's like
how many shades of this do we really
need in our lives
you know I know I've got to have dupes
for these so it will be nice to know
which which shades I already have that
are dupes for these I mean some of these
maybe I don't have dupes because these
are like these are pretty unique they're
beautiful that's the first time swash
them definitely are beautiful I'm gonna
have fun with these Thank You Cynthia
I'm like saying you're thinking I've got
dupes of these no I don't know I doubt
they're amazing that's really cool
Gigi says starburst is her favorite
shade too it's in multiple abh pulse yes
it's a dupe for okay dupe for something
I missed it um Meghan says there's so
many similar highlights but I want all
the makeups I'm with you I'm with you we
need every highlighter I know but
wouldn't it be nice to like like I want
to go through my collection if I have
the time I want to go through my
collection and just do like serious like
lining off all my highlighters by shade
than doing like a comparison to see like
which ones are really similar that you
don't really need because how many
champagne highlighters are there like a
million do you like the new hourglass
highlighter palette I do I do and this
was sent to me by my friend Nancy where
is it
hold on here it is the only I don't like
is look at that that's gross that's
really gross I have to like so compare
and declutter that would be a really
great idea Lisa wonderful I would love
to do it Naomi says maybe deep potting
area arranging I am NOT deep potting
ever again i depotted when I first
started doing youtube videos and I broke
a few shadows and it just it's not worth
teapot and plus then you end up with
these huge massive palettes like I'd
rather have a bunch of little palettes
than huge massive palettes that's just
me personally and also it's for review
purposes if everything's depotted then
it's not functional for the audience you
know what I mean but like decluttering
would be great that would be wonderful
Marina says why are almost all high lers
gold or champagne tone because that's
what looks pretty a lot of people
favorite brush brand right now is Mota
but I also will probably a tie between
Mota and Loxy but mode is less expensive
and then I also like Real Techniques
brushes I also really like there's a
very brand called beauty junkies you can
get off Amazon it's amazing those are
kind of my favorites I love Sigma
brushes Sigma brushes are super fab
alright let me swatch these for you real
quick
am I gonna try the Jacke on a
highlighter I don't think so it looks to
be too gold for me I don't like gold
highlighters on my skintone so these are
what I really like about these is that
they're respectfully it's shiny like
they are very poppin but they're not
opaque they are still a Sheerness to
them do you see that like this these are
like BAM like no joke oops let's take
the plastic off ever since Laura told me
how much these little plastic things
cost I always feel bad
throwing the movement when Laura Lee
told me that like how much they cost all
together I was like oh
hmm well I felt bad throwing them away
I saved her PR box cuz she told me how
much it cost I was like I felt bad
throwing it away cuz I kept it all right
I thought I had it right here but I
don't I put it away okay so if you look
at like the level of showing here's the
abh and then here's the I don't know if
you can see it here's the hourglass so
with the hourglass it's not as like the
color isn't it is opaque with the outlet
with the with the with the moment but
the hourglass sorry I didn't get much
sleep with the hourglass it's a little
more blends into the skin where with the
more poppy highlighters they're like a
almost like a stripe that you have to
blend and it's just poppier as far as
cost I don't know that off the top of my
head but they're pricey I do know that
they're pricey so it's really you know
the original hourglass palette is really
nice for people that want a little
highlight but don't want a from space
highlighter this is a more from space
highlighter I do have the original one
over there I mean let me get it quickly
sorry I can't find it quickly you know
oh is that it yeah it is Han okay I
found it sorry I don't mean to shake you
like that I apologize okay so this is
the original one and these are more like
they're so soft I love these I ran out
of arm space here I don't know if you
can see that but see how they're just
like a very light highlight this is more
like everyday wearable works cool not
trying to get a whole bunch of attention
kind of highlight palette where these
are more like
bam popping in your face kind of stuff
this being the most intense this being
less intense iris says both our glass
palettes just released are beautiful but
the ambient light one is amazing not
glittery you see okay gotcha
well aren't these all ambient light no
they're not this is strobe light and
this is ambient and this is strobe which
makes sense that this would be ambient
this would be strobe so where all these
creepers coming from goodness Oh wrong
with people I'm just like banning people
all over the place I know the moderators
are too why only by a band two people
and Michelle got him at the same time to
neutral from me to use much anyway well
I mean if you want something more poppy
you don't want to get the original
hourglass you want to get something like
you know pop you're like the Anasazi at
one okay oh my gosh people are just mmm
okay so another thing I want to show you
where we what are we doing on time here
because this doesn't have hope it does
have a time clock 30 minutes okay okay
okay so this is a drugstore product that
I wanted to mention to you I wore I've
been trying these out I was gonna do a
liquid lipstick smack down drugstore
liquid lipstick smack down and I
probably will still do it eventually
the problem with drugstore liquid
lipsticks I'm like trying to get them
whole face in the street
the problem with drugstore liquid
lipsticks and drugstore products in
general is they're constantly coming up
with new things so like let's say they
released something and then you know two
months later they it's gone and they've
replaced it with something else and as a
reviewer that's extremely frustrating
I've had that happen to me multiple
times where I'm working on a review of
something and then the product I was
gonna review is gone like Ulta brand is
famous for that Ulta brand you you can't
get like they'll keep some things but
you never know what they're gonna take
off the shelves and they take it off
immediately like you can't find it I got
an eyeshadow palette I put it in my
favorites and fails it was an amazing
foiled eyeshadow palette by the time I
got it in my favorites and fails they
had discontinued it same thing with the
Ulta contour product so I always get
nervous
to do like especially Ulta brand Ulta
brand just oh but like this is Lonnie
London I got this from Ulta and this was
part of that liquid lipstick video that
I was working on this is the slay all
day liquid lipstick this is in the shade
hashtag TBT this stuff is so drying it
literally sucked the life out of my lips
like well not literally you can't really
suck literally suck life out of your
lips but it literally dehydrated my lips
it was awful to the point where I felt
like after ice were it my lips were like
they still look they look awful and I
wore this yesterday and I'm reading it
and I think that it's probably usable if
you pair it with you know might be able
to pair it with a lip gloss or a lip
balm or something like that but oh my
gosh straight up but whole lips ivn she
Diaries absolutely straight up it was it
was awful but actually you know what
that's not necessarily true it didn't
look as bad as it felt
it looks fine let me go ahead and swatch
it for you
I've got swatches like crazy it looks
okay it what it really wasn't but whole
lips now that I'm thinking about it I
was being impulsive in that answer it
was just the way that it felt it was
horrible so so yeah I definitely don't
recommend these unless you don't mind
the drying liquid lipsticks it is kiss
proof goes on opaque it's really pretty
shade but it feels terrible absolutely
terrible on the lips I don't even know
the only reason why I kept it on as long
as I did was because I left and they
didn't have anything to replace it with
and it was I couldn't get it off because
it is kiss proof it was hard to get
often ooh
Gigi says what and want catsuit rocks my
favorite yes I've heard so many good
things about that and I did buy a couple
of those around Halloween and I never
used them I just I never used them so
those were the oh and then one more
thing I wanted to show you that I
haven't showed you on the channel I've
had these for a while these are the
smashbox be legendary triple tone
lipsticks and they look like this
it open it kind of stick a little bit
and the idea is it's supposed to be an
ombre lip so I'm gonna go and put this
one on so I can shade Darrent caller
this one but the problem is this now
I've got to do this and the dark is
gonna end up in the middle which is not
what you're supposed to do so you got to
go like death and flip it upside down
and it's just weird let's go at this
weird little stripe it's so odd
they feel really good though as soon as
you wash your lips together it's gon be
ombre is gone so I feel like these are
super gimmicky they feel really good
they're nice lipsticks but don't get
them for the ombre get them because you
like the shade not because of the ombre
nice because I mean it's a nice concept
but it just doesn't work kind of like
those ombre eyeshadows I think benefit
have the ombre eyeshadows where you
could like paint Amman and one stripe
they don't work it's a nice thought then
you can just do it all in one stripe but
it doesn't work I mean Smashbox overall
has disappointed me for probably 80% of
the things that I've gone from Smashbox
I haven't liked but this honestly it is
a very comfortable lipstick it feels
very nice it's just the the whole ombre
thing doesn't work so I just want to
mention that cuz I've had these for a
while and I've been meaning to mention
it for a while and I haven't you can see
it's a pretty color and it feels great
feels wonderful
melissa's has benefits ombre lip
thingies like they don't do the bottom
yeah I mean it's just kind of awkward to
do the bottom like it's almost like they
would need to like have it a way that it
like flips somehow I don't know how they
would do it though I don't know I don't
know so that was all the stuff that I
wanted to show you but we've still got
about 25 minutes left so we'll just
leave it open to community chat the
problem here is that I can't the the way
that the chat goes is it just Scrolls up
and then it disappears and the the
comments are only on the screen for
about three seconds so if I can't read
it really fast
it just completely disappears and I
can't go back and look I don't think
there's an oh no I can I can scroll yeah
I can scroll oh that makes me so happy I
touch it just to see if I could and I
can
Cerreta says I don't wear liquid
lipstick anymore only regular lips like
my go-to czar NYX look with
NIC's lipsticks I always go back to them
very cool oh it faded oh it came back
when I touched it
I'm learning new things every day yeah
I'm Jay Foster says just flip it upside
down but it it's weird
I did I did flip it upside down but it's
weird me my coffee I don't even know how
I'm functional today there we go
glam Dewey says what's your favorite
liquid lipstick right now I'm my
favorite formula I have a couple so my
favorite formula is the bare minerals
Gen nudes I love though is they're very
whippy they're very moist they're not
transfer proof they feel extremely
comfortable they're really just a very
comfortable version of a liquid version
of a lipstick like it's liquid lipstick
they're a comfortable version of a
lipstick that's why I really like them
they smell amazing they smell really
really good other ones that are more
transfer proof I love the Ofra ones over
ones are fantastic there are more
transfer proof not completely transfer
proof but more transfer proof lasting
power is much better on the Ofra but
they're a little more drying they're not
quite as comfortable also the cryptic
cosmetics ones I have the ones that were
in my monthly favorites this month those
are amazing they remind me of the Oprah
ones but they're transfer proof so they
they're about the same level of dryness
but they're more transfer proof than the
Oprah ones but they're not hydrating but
they are like I was saying in the video
the are pricey per gram a per ounce or
no leader or whatever they're measured
and they are pricey you don't get a
whole lot of product in them but if you
never look through a whole liquid
lipstick anyway it's not even gonna
matter uh let's see
Sharon says Hodel liquid lipstick
formula is good too I have not tried it
and then Nicki says the same thing about
the hooda stella says what about doing a
video on an entire half of the face of
dupes and then the originals this is
dumb I've seen that done with a lot of
people I don't know I mean it's
definitely an idea I think it would
knock out a lot of products in one video
it's definitely a good idea but I feel
like everybody does that video Shannon
says a good Judy do you recommend the it
CC cream I do like it I don't like their
shade range
I have trouble finding a match for my
skin tone I find that they leave
do they lean Orange I can't remember
because I haven't used them I have two
different shades let me get my my Etsy
secret and hold on the bottom right here
I'm making a mess
you put my coffee back over here back
behind please don't fall off I'm scared
this whole set up is just gonna fall
okay so these are the two bit CC creams
I have I have light and I have medium I
start off with medium which is too dark
for me man I just I'm just watching all
over the place the mediums too dark the
texture and consistency is really good
it is not vegan it does have snail
secretions in it if that bothers you
then you definitely do not want to get
this I've heard some terrible things
about how snail secretions are collected
I have not done personal research but my
subscribers have told me things about
that that I need to research you know
for myself just have my own knowledge
this is the light this is the medium you
can see the medium is at very medium but
it's too dark for me the light is just a
little bit light for me so I mix the two
and it's fine I do find that it cakes a
little bit around my nose during the day
so it's not my favorite CC cream but I
do really like it it's good I know this
is very very popular very very hyped up
a lot of people love it Becky loves it
Mary Elizabeth likes my decorations
Thank You Mary Elizabeth I appreciate
that um I tried to keep it holiday
neutral so we don't have Christmas trees
and we don't have a menorah you don't
have try to keep it like winter themed
Cindy says I just ordered the superhero
5 from it cosmetics superhero 5 sounds
like a movie from QVC I am with the huge
brush oh wow I don't know anything about
that
Shawna wants no there is a difference in
color with the illuminating one and the
regular one with these good to know
thank you so much for that probably
catty says I'm not quite sure what
you're drinking there can't quite see
the giant printing on your giant
printing mug
oh I know right my coffee mug it's very
silly let me put
it always looks like a bomb went off
after chat actually I think I'm pretty
sure this was given to me this mug was
given to me by our realtor when we
bought our first house I think that's
where we got these from that she gave us
a gift when we bought her house
colleagues
oh hello cauliflower how are you check
out her YouTube channel she said she
loves a superhero mascara from it
cosmetics the first time I saw this and
saw that I that I've told this story
before but Kristin game when I met her
who's amazing from never seen Kristin
games she's amazing um when I first met
her she was wearing it I thought she's
wearing false lashes but it was
superhero mascara when I tried it it
didn't do much for me so I know that it
works really well for some people I've
seen it but it doesn't work great for me
unfortunately oh good to see you Sara
says it it's CC cream would lift when I
use setting powder on a powder puff to
set it such a bad makeup day yeah it's
not my favorite I really do like let me
get a couple of my favorite CC creams
problem is I have you where I usually
set my coffee eyes either behind me or
on a desk next to me but I'm using the
desk to put you on and now I have this
here actually I can set it down here out
of frame Gigi says here the one of the
few I think falsies look good on
girlfriend I use the smallest falsies
compared to other people I use the
smallest fake lashes I can't I can't do
like the big huge it looks ridiculous on
me it looks ridiculous okay
grab some stuff
okay here's three here's three CC creams
so we've got the pur Lisse BB it's BB
cream but it's it's a nice coverage and
then this is the clay one that I found
out is not owned by Shiseido I'm very
embarrassed I don't know where I read
that when I first got that this is owned
by Shiseido but it's not this is a KBT
brands but KB brands can still be owned
by Japanese brands and that's what I
thought
but it looks like this is not owned by
Shiseido but this is amazing I'm
actually like getting low on this
because it's amazing and then this one
this is the sweet cotton pork cover BB
cream by Holika Holika which they were
supposed to send me some stuff I was
supposed to do a sponsor video with them
and they never sent me anything and I'm
so sad because I wanted to do more with
this brand
I've really enjoyed this k-beauty brand
as well so these are kind of my three
favorites right now and I know none of
these are like you can go to the
drugstore and just go pick it up today
but I have to tell you which ones are my
favorite these are my favorites this
when I got off Amazon this one's giving
to me by pur Lisse and this one I got
with FC points but they're really good
Sarah says where do you shop your
k-beauty I get a lot of my stuff off of
Amazon but I've been getting more stuff
off so go glam I met them at generation
Beauty I go to so many generation events
so you'll always hear me talking about
it but but I met them and they were very
very nice and I've gotten a couple of
things from SoCo glam now let's see
Vanessa says Jen if you tried the new
Maybelline superstar foundation no I
have not amber says if you tried the
Boreum BB or CC cream no I haven't I've
heard of it but I've never tried it
Don says I've been using the cotija my
face was so dry something I need
something more hydrating as far as the
the cote the the powder I am NOT a big
fan of the Coty powder to be honest it's
fine but I like other ones better I
really like my favourite face powders I
really like the welder I really liked
the Laura Laura Mercier
I love the bare minerals I love the the
Too Faced the new peach one those are my
favorites right now
Dandan says if he tried the Hooda
palette the small ones that came out in
Sephora III yes I got one of them I just
saw Angela is here hello Angelica
Jellico me I'm gonna get it I'm gonna
get it one day angelic I swear I put
your name every time and I feel so bad
oh my gosh okay but thank you for being
here you need to check out her channel
too
Angelica NY q VI st is her last name
check out her YouTube channel everybody
raves it out her like when I when I
asked for recommendation for channels
people recommend her all the time so
definitely check out her YouTube channel
very very honest youtuber what was i
doing okay so give you a size comparison
so here's the new hood ah I really do
like it it's very nice is it something
that I'm like oh my gosh mind-blowing
like I was with the coloured raine no
but it's good it's definitely good so
this one beautiful and then this one I
got at the same time with this for sale
you can see the size of it size
difference see it looks like the hood of
pans are it looks like the hood is a lot
smaller but there's just less space
between the pans so they really are
about the same I believe this one has
doesn't say how many grams total let me
see I have to look it up but they look
like they're almost the same and it's
just busy art puts a lot of space
between their palettes don't they look
almost the same let's put it next to
each other yeah they're like the same
size oh I totally just dug my nail in
there that's not cool
but yeah they're they're definitely I
mean if you look at them next to let's
pull up an a BH I totally just dug my
nail into that I'm still mad about that
there's a prism palette there it is so
let me put him next to the prism in case
you're having an honest Asya palette
so they look to be a little bit bigger
than the AH Nastasia pants just a little
bit and then let's put it next to the
rock cuz well rock pants are tiny look
at the difference between all the rock
pan they're so tiny I guess they're not
that much different but they're still
different the rock pans are the smallest
in my opinion from what I've seen the
rock pans are tiny but I love the
quality of lorac shadows they're super
fab let's see Tiffany says I bought the
hood a mini yesterday and I really like
at the darkest one with metallics cool
Erica says so excited to have made this
live my very first live and it's my
birthday happy birthday Erica and let's
see we've got about 14 minutes left liz
lisa says metal mini mat mini buyer know
by I don't know it's kind of hard to
just look like buyer nobody know yeah I
don't know I mean the supposedly it's
the same as the regular accountant she's
done by the Kat Von D metal matte the
original Kat Von D metal mat was amazing
so if you don't own the original I've
heard that the shades are either exactly
the same or they may have added a couple
of new ones but there are a lot of them
are exactly the same so if you missed
out on the metal mat then you might want
to consider getting it if you like the
really poppy shadows if it's the same
formula I haven't seen the ingredients
yet but that that metal matte palette
was amazing
favorite Urban Decay palette Stefanie is
definitely that Alice in Wonderland
palette the Alice Through the Looking
Glass palette my fave I love that
palette oh my gosh that was where my
favorite videos I've ever done on the
channel - Alice Through the Looking
Glass palette video I was so proud of
that video um these are going so fast
Cindy says I just bought my first color
popped out yes please I hope it's good
I've had some some mixed experiences
with color pop eyeshadows some of them I
really like it some of them I don't alex
says I really want to buy it I don't
know what she's talking about
she says it
I don't know what it is no cavity
shadows overall are amazing favorite
white eyeliner for the waterline I don't
wear a lot of white in the waterline I
wear more nude in a waterline and I
happen to have my I just decluttered
these so I've actually got it very
organized right now so I can show you
the one from ziwei is nice I like the
one from za if you don't know a lot of
people will use a cream color in the
waterline to kind of brighten the eyes
angelica says H&amp;amp;M beauty has great white
liner for the waterline thank you so
much for that Angelica so she knows
she's got this the NYX wonder pencil I
would say is my go-to for the cream in
the waterline it's super fab love the
NYX wonder pencil I've sharpened this
thing down where I don't usually sharpen
pencils like I don't use them that much
but this is one I've sharpened down it
does have a strong wood scent though I
can smell the wood Michelle says the
Rimmel nude I like the Rimmel nude but I
find that it doesn't stay in my
waterline that long doesn't stay as long
for me as the NYX does that's just my
personal experience Serafina says love
the hmm shadow sticks that's awesome
Melissa says seconding the Rimmel nude
April says I love the NYX wonder pencil
I do too
Sarah likes the NYX wonder pencil Kida
says I have extremely watery eyes and I
still have never found an eyeliner that
stays on now Korina says I love before
the NYX Abby said the Jacqueline Hill
palette really is that good highly
recommend totally agree I had somebody
leave a comment the other day saying
that it was one of the worst palace
they've ever tried and it's like I don't
know about that no if you just don't
like do you ever feel like that
sometimes where you're like something
you like have an opinion about something
and like I know people feel like this
about me because they leave comments
where they're like no you're really
wrong on that no this is a really good
product but for me it's really terrible
but like sometimes when people leave
comments on my videos about things that
I like strongly disagree with and it's
like if you've really tried it really
I know people think the same thing about
me so it's just you know back and forth
but I was like oh it's really good but
it's all opinion base and and that's
what makes the world go around is that
we all have different opinions right
Abby said what palettes have been been
trying I know I don't know I mean it
genuinely is a good palette it really is
especially for the price point I mean
it's amazing for the price point but any
other questions about anything anything
else you guys wanted to know or want to
talk about Shauna says I want to try the
Marc Jacobs eyeliner yeah I haven't had
great luck with the Marc Jacobs
eyeliners they're they're okay they're
alright John says I bought the vamp
stamp last night excited to try it it
really is a game changer if you like
like bigger wings it's a game changer
it's super fab did you get the the ink
with it I hope you got to ink with it
because it's amazing Sarah says has your
NYX epic ink liner gone weird on you yet
the only thing about my NYX epic ink
that is not good again I have it like
right here it's right here
the only thing about my NYX epic ink
that is not good is I don't see the hair
the hairs like it's like because when
you put it in you just have to be really
careful like I just need to cut them the
little you see the little hairs I should
have cut them because it's a brush step
but no it hasn't gone weird at all other
than that CJ says have you tried kale
polish I am wearing kale polish this is
I put this on five days ago and it's
finally getting to the point where it
needs to be taken off like this is this
is really chippy for me I don't like to
keep my nail polish on much past this
like this is this is when it's time for
me to take it off this is the new
Lumiere they were kind enough to send me
the lips and tip set so unfortunately I
don't know if I'm gonna be able to try
all of them before the review because
they're lasting so long where the first
line I got I bought her first line and
they did not last very long on me for
whatever reason so I got to try all of
them before I reviewed but these are
taking so long a chip I may only be able
to try like two or three of them
and then the other ones just kind of
swatch what I might do is kind of do you
know have just we got really weird nails
for a while where I have all the nail
polishes all over my nails just so I can
try them I don't know I don't know what
I'm gonna do because I did promise them
I would do a review for it not sponsored
but I knew there was gonna be a high
interest for it so I told mind would do
it you know not sponsor and they could
send it to me and I would review it but
yeah so far really liking them the shine
on them is beautiful even without the
topcoat it's beautiful
staff says hashtag not sponsored
Stefan's the one that put that into my
channel with hashtag not sponsored Oh
Christiana Anna's here Elvis had some
great pen liners but they dry out fast
yes totally agreed Kristina and
cosmetics Kristina is here she sent me
her new brow pomade and I honestly have
forgotten to use it she just sent it to
me last week and I haven't used it yet
and I probably bad now but I will use it
I promise and I will update you on how
it is because the her products are very
very affordable in compared to other
products Oh Stephanie says I don't like
the Jacqueline Hill palette - two of the
shadows in the palette have just
crumbled and gone all over the other
shadows and I can see that you have you
can't dig into a little role you know
you got to be relatively gentle with it
because they are they are pretty soft
Julie wants to know if boxycharm is
worth it looks so tempting it depends I
mean what I would suggest you do because
everyone has different products that
they would enjoy what I suggest you do
is go to the boxycharm website you can
click on where it says past boxes and
look and see what they've sent in the
past and see if you think that it will
be worth it to you because everyone has
different preferences it's really hard
to say that you know whether it's gonna
be worth it for you when I've never met
you personally and I don't know what
your collection looks like I don't know
what your preferences are I don't you
know so it's hard but I would definitely
recommend checking out either unboxing
videos I do them here on my channel or
going to their website and just browsing
a bit but personally I I for me I think
that it's definitely worth the 21
dollars even though they do send it to
me for review I would pay for it if they
weren't sending it to me I would
definitely pay for it that's what
question I get asked all the time when
something is sent to me they say well
would you buy it would you have
with your money and I think that's a
great question to always answer I'm
gonna try to incorporate that into all
my videos that products were sent to me
tulips Stewart says I love Marc Jacobs
Island or that is awesome
seller says boxycharm is good if you
like makeup GlossyBox is good if you
like makeup in skincare I didn't have a
good experience with glossy box I had it
for a year and I was not impressed with
that but there was a couple years ago so
maybe it's gotten better
does anyone else I don't know what
you're trying to say dawn Dawn's she
says does anyone else make nor during
these videos noted make oh make notes
make notes during these videos oh that's
such an honor I'm so glad well you know
the community is amazing with coming up
with great things if you want to join
our community and have long-standing
conversations we do have a Facebook
group it's um groups comms wait
facebook.com slash group / ones have
been makeup one day I will get it right
the first time and it's a great place to
talk about makeup and it's a great
community it's wonderful people we do
run a tight ship with the rules though
which some people don't like and some
people appreciate I personally think
that it's good that you know we have
very strict rules over there to keep the
community a nice comfortable place but
Jennifer wants to know which boxes do I
still receive the only one I get for PR
is boxycharm that's the only one that
gets sent to me
oh wait that's not true and fabfitfun is
sponsored every is a sponsored unboxing
every season that's the only one that's
sponsored and then I purchase it see and
I purchase boxycharm extra purchase the
birch box it was the two that I buy but
other than that I'm not getting anymore
I see CJ says what would you recommend
to spend the vib Rouge bonus on well I
can tell you what I'm gonna spend mine
on I am going I'm waiting for the
two-faced metals palette to come on to
fit I could - come on Sephora and that's
what I'm buying with mine there's so
much good stuff I mean what I would
recommend is I mean I have monthly
favorites videos I have products that
are worth the hype video that won't
um I have like highly rated products at
Sephora and whether they're worth it or
not that I have a video on that I would
recommend watching that one there's just
so many good products out there and the
thing is is again I don't know your
personal collection I don't know your
personal preferences so it's hard for me
to recommend something specifically for
you you know what I mean
yeah those Too Faced gold chocolate gold
palette yes did I say it wrong I might
have said it wrong because there's two
people that are correcting me the
chocolate gold palette I might have said
it wrong to face metals is that what I
call it Angela I might have called it
that but that's that's what I'm gonna
buy with it the name of the Facebook
group is it's called what's up in makeup
if you search for what's up the makeup
you should find it or you can do
facebook.com slash group slash what's up
in makeup someone had said if I was
going to do a review of the kale the
kathleenlights dream palette no I don't
plan to I the thing is is there there's
only so many hours in the day and
there's only one face I can't like I
can't review everything that I want to
review it's just not possible so and
editing takes forever so you know I
almost decided not to get the Too Faced
gold palette because I mean it's it's
stupid I know it's stupid but they had
John cookie and on their on their store
on their Instagram story and I was like
really really I don't know if you guys
know John cookie in the drama channel
but I he's he's a cruddy dude man he's a
cruddy dude so so yeah that really
bothered me oh no you can't hear me let
me get a little closer so it really
bothered me that that he was supposedly
invited to spend time with Too Faced and
that really that bothered me like it's
very rare that someone bothers me to
that level the only other person that
bothered me to that level is Jeffrey
star and Jeffrey I feel like you know
he's I don't know they're both just I I
feel like a John's even worse than
Jeffery in some ways like some of the
stuff that he's done to people is just
sick he's just he's so that really
bothered me so I almost just decided I'm
just not gonna like I'm just gonna skip
on that release not banned to face for
my channel but skip on that release but
then I kind of had a reality check and I
was like you
what like it's just because you showed
up at a party doesn't mean he's
collabing with them or anything you know
what I mean like it's it so I let it go
and I'm still gonna do it but that
really bothered me yeah so is anyway
yeah if you don't know who John cooking
is don't Google him don't don't waste
your time don't waste your life it's not
worth it it's totally not worth it but
anyway I'm going off on a drama tangent
and I probably shouldn't do that but
just just it hurt he hurts my heart he
hurts my heart
jaren sister is a big fan of John Cook
and actually will do one more little
drama gossipy kind of thing point it off
in here but when I did my video on the
Laura Lee palette Jerrod sister came to
my video and she commented that I was
wrong on the number of grams that were
in Laura's palette because John had said
that they were a certain thing and I was
saying something different and that I
should go over to John's video to get
the correct information which John was
wrong
John had gotten the information from
Jeffrey who was also wrong about the
number of grams in the palette and I
contacted Laura and I said you know
Jeffrey's got it wrong in his video you
know it's getting spread there's less
product in your palette than there is in
one to face shadow like that's not true
it's not right there two grand pans and
you know but but Jack Jared's sister
came to my channel and said basically
you're wrong go check out John's video
and I was like what like John doesn't
even have the palette how does he know
why are you trusting something that
doesn't even have the palette in their
hands over somebody that's showing you
the palette and the packaging like what
how doesn't even make any sense like I
don't know her other than that one
comment but that bothered me like I was
like oh my gosh so maybe I may be you
know that's how he ended up getting to
know people at toothpaste and all but
but yeah I was very surprised at that I
was like um no John's wrong I have the
pally in my hand I'm right trust me
so but anyway that was my last thing um
Joe do you wanted to know if the bad
habit palette is good I have not tried
it on my eyes I just watched it I'm
gonna do
full review of the bad habit brand I
have I'm gonna do a bunch of swatch
comparisons of things that I own and
give you my general overall review but I
now that i've swatched the the new one
the aura palette i want to wear it on my
eyes today
- i'm probably gonna do one eye with the
abh and one eye with the aura palette
today just as kind of a so I can give
you at least some kind of information I
might have to wait to film it until like
Tuesday so I can wear it a couple of
times because I don't like to do a
overview until I've at least tried it a
couple of times you know yeah
georgette said you're awesome if you
don't like the two-faced lady yet - I I
really I mean there's so many you know
it's one of those things like I know I

everybody makes mistakes and she just
made a mistake and it's okay it's all
good

representation of Jared she's her own
person like Jared is his person usually
