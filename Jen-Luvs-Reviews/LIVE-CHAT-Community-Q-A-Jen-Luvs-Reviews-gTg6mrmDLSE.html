up and makeup chats I don't know oh
let's see okay good it looked like it
wasn't showing up in the feeds of my
subscribers yet so I'm sorry about that
I forgot that my microphone was there
I'm sure that was really loud I'm so
sorry
hi everybody so I figured today since
we've done a lot of topic heavy chats
recently I figured we would just do like
a free-form community Q&amp;amp;A so this isn't
just about me because my channel isn't
up just about me and my opinions it's
about the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness and using this as a way to
have community so that we can all share
our own opinions about everything and we
can make more educated purchases I do
realize not everybody is watching
YouTube beauty videos for educational
purposes but I do feel that that is the
purpose of my channel and the people
that are interested in those kinds of
things in making more educated purchases
and saving money and sometimes spending
money on things that we don't
necessarily need but really really work
because we found it's really really good
you all know what I'm talking about
that's kind of what it what my channel
is about so I feel I can attract that
those kinds of people that are
interested in that so if you're not
interested in making more educated
purchases this chat is not going to be
for you but if you are we're all gonna
work together on this topic today so
let's go ahead and say hello to the
collective brain that is here live I am
so excited that it finally went out to
your feeds
I set it live about 10 minutes ago and
it finally sent out also had some
trouble with the upload of our makeup
news show what's been makeup this
morning that it went out wait so it
really stinks but you know it happens
everything's up everything's good so
we're gonna move on Caroline is here
good morning to you Michelle is here

assuming Julio's here as well all right
so if I didn't get to say hello to you
hello to you and thank you for being
here let's go ahead and get started
hopefully everybody is doing well I am
doing well things are good
let's see current makeup purchases
things that I'm working on the caridy
cosmetics eyeshadow palettes is my next
eyes shadow palette review my next
foundation review is going to be the
fenty foundation so we're gonna be
reviewing that along with the fancy lip
gloss and one of the highlighters so
that is going to hopefully be coming up
next week both of those videos probably
fenty first and then carroty I haven't
decided 100% what I'm gonna do for what
the Kay it's gonna have to be something
that I can do it like more of a first
impression on rather than like a
thorough you know tried it over a long
period of time review Heidi says cute
top thank you Oh Valerie happy birthday
my supernatural friend she says she's
spending her birthday morning with her
what's up and makeup family uh-huh
if you don't know I'm a huge fan of the
television show Supernatural and Valerie
and I we chat about Supernatural all the
time we have that very much in common
Michele is here can I tell you how upset
I am I didn't have the money when the
tarts lay the clay play palette was on
sale I know I'm sorry I did see that it
was half off and I was like I hope
people jump on that because it really is
a good palette and I can see Tarte
getting rid of it relatively quickly I
think that's what's happening a lot with
the Sephora sales it's it's the palettes
and products and things that they're
kind of maybe overstocked on like the
Anasazi lippies maybe they had an
overstock of product that you know they
have X amount of shelf life maybe they
were just trying to push some old
product something like that that's where
I'm thinking
stuff comes from something large in the
house you've never seen Samantha March
is YouTube channel you definitely need
to check it out if you like my channel
you will love Samantha she's amazing I'm
sad I missed her live chat but I'm happy
that she's here
Veronica is asking why about something I
don't know
Nilo is here oh there you go Ileana is
it Ileana I was calling you Neil oh and
then it skipped down I think you said
Elly on above where it skipped down
let's see Jen from Indy Katy Juan says I
made smart choices and canceled all my
subscription boxes just to use things up
before I get more gathered up that is
really smart I have a neighbor and she
would freak out if she knew I was
talking about her right now because
she's she's very intense and she's so
funny and she is a subscription box
addict and like I haven't gotten deep
into the girlfriend like let's have a
chat about what you have let's work it
out you know she just loves getting
subscription boxes which is totally on
her but she's so funny she cracks me up
but she's in the subscription box addict
zone that I used to be in where you know
you just get all the subscription boxes
so I don't know if you know where she's
at but that's where she's at and I'm
hoping that you know she'll come off of
it soon because I can tell it's starting
to weigh on her all the stuff that she's
getting she's kind of on that edge you
know what I mean let's see what are we
missing here let's see Mika says went to
Sephora yesterday to pick up several
items it was so disappointing no funny
foundation or peach perfect in my shade
they don't even carry the peach perfect
at my Sephora yeah I heard that Shauna
says did you see the last night desi
showed the Fendi Holiday Collection I
did it you know I get I haven't watched
desi Perkins to be completely honest
with you I don't think I've ever watched
a complete video by desi Perkins and
I've heard that she's wonderful I don't
know why I haven't watched it I think
it's just because maybe I'm intimidated
by how flippin gorgeous she is or
something I don't know what it is but
I've never watched one of her videos
like ever I'm gonna do something bad and
I'm gonna wipe my glasses off very
gently with my shirt I know that's bad
but it's a little foggy and I need to be
able to say sorry if that hurt the
microphone
but Shirley says I've been watching
Supernatural since day one and I love it
even though they keep going to the
afterlife and come back and they do die
a lot they do die I'd see life with mrs.
D I'm here from the UK it's
mid-afternoon here glad to catch you
live glad to see you Theresa is here
thoughts of new Pat McGrath eyeshadow
palettes from a distance they look
beautiful I would love to put my fingers
in them I can tell you that I have that
feeling I just want to sculpt Chung just
want to sleep you ever feel that when
you see a picture and you just want to
take your fingers all in a minute that's
the way I feel about the path of growth
i shadow palettes I don't know I'm
hoping that they're worth it Pat McGrath
Holiday Collection
I saw the palette that I mean I pad the
fancy Holiday Collection I saw the
palette and it looks really pretty
Joe says I've been disappointed with
Sephora play box and sort of the epsy
one yeah I hear that I hear that I mean
you get little tiny samples so you have
to really dig on those little tiny
samples does anyone well if she's
getting a little better I feel like
Birchbox is what I feel like they've
been dropping the ball really bad lately
Gwen says does anyone know if Besame is
going to do the mini lipstick it this
year oh I don't know I hope they do
though
Michelle's talking about Deanna has died
so much he's Kenny on South Park he has
yeah yeah as he keeps coming back though
oh my gosh I'm given spoilers I'm so
sorry I need to stop let me stop with a
supernatural I'm sorry I'm just gonna
before I dig a hole any further all
right autumn says I got rid of all my
lorac Pro palette they were all wet
muddy on me I'm gonna sit this one out
oh oh you were you guys talking about
the Emily Noel eighty-three review on
the lorac mega pro four if you have not
watched that video by Emily Noel 83 oh
my gosh she makes me want that palette I
didn't want it and now I want it Heidi
says we'll be reviewing the Tarte
toasted eye palette I'm kind of liking
the way it looks I don't know man
I don't know if I'm gonna get that one
because it is like so many pallets that
are already out you know and right now
I'm kind of drowning in things I want to
review I have two holiday pallets that I
want to review for you the the to face
boss lady boss boss uh PD agenda the
agenda one and then the tarte one that
like flips open and has all kinds of
cool stuff in it that one actually seems
really really nice so I really want to
review those I also have the Kat Von D
holiday palette so coming up after the
carroty ones is the Kat Von D one and
then we'll see what happens after that
as far as what's gonna be next so it's
like I feel like I'm kind of backed up
so I don't really want to buy anything
for a review that's new until I get
through the ones that I have I also want
to start putting out some other reviews
on some like less involved products
because like last week I totally killed
myself like with with the collection the
Too Faced collection video and then the
Laura Lee cat's pajamas video those
videos or a lot of work one of them was
I think like 40 minutes the other ones
like 35 minutes and I killed myself last
week so this week I'm gonna try to take
it a little easier we'll do the carroty
on Friday and then I'm defending on
Wednesday that's not gonna be easy is it
I might not go dig so deep on the Fendi
I don't know but people like it when I
dig deep I don't know let's see Stacy
says I can't wait for my Ipsy this month
more high-end products this month oh I
didn't realize that very cool Meghan
says I want that Kat Von D Oh Meghan
you're here Meghan I need to make you an
admin ad moderator yay I was trying to
add you but I couldn't get your YouTube
channel okay Meghan is like all-around
awesome person in the community she is
one of the Facebook admins she is a
reporter for what's been makeup she's
been with my channel forever and for
some reason she hasn't been a mod on
our moderator on the chat so I'll make
sure I got that sorry that was off-topic
Veronica says live stream is off whoo
hopefully you can refresh it oh no April
says I bought the bullit yesterday and
ordered the Claddagh Poe foundation from
Neiman's hmm oh my golf score rule hey
I've heard it's good I hope that you
like it
yay megan has a wrench you its longtime
common girlfriend long time coming
Erica says I really love your husky
voice all thanks it's just it's just
sleepy voice I had some fighting with
YouTube last night a little bit of
fighting and a little bit of fighting
with the video I made some last minute
editing changes you know I'm not gonna
go deep into why but I made some last
minute editing changes about 3 o'clock
in the morning and decided to reload the
whole thing I got not much sleepless
thanks so glad glad you liked my voice
Holly says you all may Rihanna a lot
richer yeah well you know she worked
hard on that collection so you know when
you work hard you're in money and that's
you know that's what happens sometimes
I'm not hating joe says I don't like the
Fanta products not sure about the new
shadows yeah Jennifer says um shouldn't
cancel Boxey just because there was no
palette the value this month is amazing
you know I didn't even look in my box
yet I haven't even opened it Stef says
love your review of cat's pajamas thank
you so much you know what's really funny
is that this is how I know I did a
really good job on the cat's pajamas
video is that I got comments saying how
you know I wasn't fair to Laura and that
you know I painted her in a bad light
and all this time I'm like what like but
basically saying that I was too hard on
Laura and then I got video a comment
saying that I was way too easy on her
like the complete opposite extremes but
there were only a few of them there were
a few that were saying I was too hard on
Laura a few that said I was way way way
too easy and I was biased and then like
hundreds of comments in the middle
saying how fair I was with it so I feel
like that's pretty stinkin good I mean
I'm gonna have people complain no matter
what I do but I feel like with reviews
the way
I feel is if I really truly like dig
into my soul you know any me like I
really think about it okay take the name
off of it take the packaging off of it
let's talk about just quality let's talk
about how good it is really how good is
it and then let's just talk about that
you know and then let then add on the
other stuff add on Laura and add on the
packaging and everything because
everyone has their own opinions about
what they look for in a purchase no
matter what it is whether it's a vacuum
cleaner or razor blades you know for
shaving your legs or you know whatever
you know you're buying there's always
something you know that you're gonna
like that someone else isn't gonna like
but that doesn't mean that the
information that you don't find valuable
isn't valid for somebody you know it's
all about perspective you know and
opening up your mind to thinking that
there's people that think differently
than you you know and it's okay Michelle
says it's your DJ easy-listening voice
uh-huh
Stacy says I think your cat's pajamas
video was so informative I was so
impressed I really put I really wanted
it to be good
I felt like Laura deserved for it to be
good Laura deserve for me to work really
hard on it and give it the best that I
could
I didn't want to shortcut it I felt like
if anything that this was one that I
wanted to make sure that I was super on
point for it and I had noticed I hadn't
really seen any swatches on deeper skin
tones I just invited Debbie over the
time before for the two-faced video and
then I was like well why like oh she
doesn't me call me call her Debbie and
where she wants to call her something
else I forget off to ask her again she's
not a fan of her name which makes me
really sad she wants me to call her
something else Sabrina I think or
something I forget off to ask her again
but whenever you see a different name
but it looks like the same skin it's the
same person just so you know and then I
was like well you know I really like to
see it on a medium skin tone so I called
Jenny over to help me too and they we
had fun you know and I you know I'll
give them you know skin care and stuff
as fair payment for helping me Jenny
says we don't have to be the same how
boring would that be yeah I know and I
feel the same way I absolutely feel the
same way
Wanda wants to know and Banshee news
to know of it Oh Wanda wants to know if
the prison pal if I was getting the
prison palette yes I am getting the
anasazi of prison palette I just ordered
it I actually didn't know it was on sale
until I read the script on Friday before
I felt so I stopped reading the script
too went and bought it because I didn't
realize it was already on sale because
they didn't have a big pre-launch for it
and the batch amuse says that that it is
limited edition that's good to know
Emily says I hate feeling rushed about
limited editions yeah I kind of feel
like that - I wish Kat Von D would come
out with a permanent palette I feel like
it's kind of messed up that she doesn't
you know which one which formula I
really really like is the pastel goth
formula that matte formula is money it
is on stinking point so I really hope
that she comes out with that I can do
without the the Glatt glitter toppers
I'm not that big of a fan of that
formula but like that matte formula is
so good
Marie says I really want the same center
palette but I can't get it on Sephora
France Oh No oh that's a bummer well
hopefully they'll open it up you might
be able to email customer service and
then see if see if you can if they'll
tell you whether it'll be available in
France or not Jenny said you found out
from your show - yeah I do because you
got to remember with the whatsapp and
makeup I don't find this information
like none of it well everyone smile I'll
find some top news stuff are all fine a
couple of things but I don't find this
stuff like this is the script I don't
write it look I don't write any of that
tab at the right set so like I don't
even know what what's gonna be in the
show until I get ready to film on Friday
and I don't even see the pictures of
things until like after I film it - like
the next day or that night when tabatha
sends me the pictures so like I'm
completely out of the loop so so you
know like when I'm filming I have no
idea what a lot of this stuff looks like
unless I've seen it you know online for
whatever reason which is kind of weird
it's kind of a weird behind-the-scenes
thing I'm letting you in on did I know
we always buy the clay palette play
April wants to know on Sephora's weekly
Wow I had someone asked me should she
buy it she's like
really don't need it should I buy it and
it's like you got a look at your
collection and see whether you have a go
to neutral palette that you use all the
time if you have one then you really
don't need it but if you don't have a go
go to neutral palette I definitely
recommend it
Kenzie is here good morning Shirley says
my hairdresser asked me what do you do
with all those eyeshadow palettes you
have I'm like I put them in rotation
girl lol she just laughed
I love it Steph loves a pastel God the
shadows are amazing they really are
andrea is here hello my friends can't
follow the comments going so fast yeah
I'm kind of pausing them in between oh
we approve I want to make sure we prove
oh no someone was coming in with uh with
some politics looks like thanks staff
for whacking them with the oh my gosh
this this is actually really funny it
said Donald J Trump is here which
obviously isn't it's somebody just
trying to stir up trouble so they hit
him with the wrench
Terry Lee is here hello my friend Terry
Lee how are you good to see you we need
to catch up I haven't talked to you in a
bit Tammy says my friend told me you
know you only have two eyes right yeah
yeah and they look darn pretty with eye
shadow on them you know I think it's a
thing with colors I just like colors and
I've always been a collector of things
you know there's always been something
in my life that I've collected that I've
been you know like when I was a kid I
don't know if anybody else remembers
these but they had these bracelets that
were like these little plastic chains
and you could buy these little clip-on
charms for them so we're bracelets and
necklace love those things I mean had
anything from like flowers to like hot
dogs and little characters and things
and all my friends would wear them and
we would collect them and oh my gosh it
was so fun so that's the first thing I
remember collecting but I've collected
things to my life Ricky says wanted
wanted you to know I'm going to make a
video for my channel about how fans of
big youtubers should behave better and
I'm going to give your channel a big
shot all Thank You Ricky's reviews let
me go and see if
can click on you and I'm gonna clip and
go to channel and if there's an autoplay
I'm just gonna pause it real quick and
I'm gonna check out your channel up look
good there's no autoplay to be loud oh
look at you you're so cute she's got a
dry brush bundle review oh these are you
oh you're just starting a channel back
up she's got a few videos but she looks
like she's starting it back up
very cool while I wish you all the best
with your channel Ricky I'm gonna watch
your um your dry brush bundle review
because I've never seen a dry brush
video before so I'm gonna watch that
after after the chats over Aspen says
yes those bracelets we were so rad
alright let's say oh people are talking
about Milani and morphe being available
at Ulta which i think is really really
super cool and you know that's one thing
I really love and respect about Ulta is
that they're trying to bring in a lot of
different brands I think Milani has been
a long time coming that should have been
there a long time ago but like how they
brought in morphe and Oprah and color
and nut coloring and dose of colors
sometimes I flip around my dose of
colors my color drain but uh but yeah so
I just lost tracks I started reading
comments but I just appreciate that
they're trying to sell other brands I
think it's a smart business move and I
think that you know people appreciate it
especially even if it's just an online
purchase I think that people appreciate
it so we would like to get their old two
points you know Debbie says Milani is
live now but Murphy isn't yet yes okay I
didn't realize Murphy wasn't live yet it
is listed so hopefully it'll be very
very soon always live from live loves
her makeup here here she is good morning
live how are you my friend
good to see you hopefully you're doing
well if you've never seen live loves for
makeup you should definitely check it
out
one thing I admire about live since
we're just doing a Q&amp;amp;A today and I can
just blah blah blah about whatever I
want well then I really admire about
live that I wish that I could do and I'm
really jealous of her and I will tell
her right now and
so jealous is that she doesn't add it
she doesn't edit like how much easier
would my life be if I didn't edit like
she's a she's a working smarter not
harder kind of person and I'm a working
harder not smarter kind of person that's
just me and I you know I've always been
like that where I I sometimes just
overwork myself where she just does it
the right way you know and she's so
thorough and she's so smart so I
definitely recommend checking her out if
you've never seen her channel she's
gonna pass me no doubt about it she's
gonna pass me and subscribers she's
amazing she's getting a lot of love
lately so I'm gonna be very proud to be
able to say that I new live back when
she had less subscribers than me so
let's say Natalie says I really want the
Saints in her palette but I'm wondering
if it's because I didn't get the metal
matte or pastel goth and I kicked myself
for it from what I've seen so far the
the Saints Center is very different from
the pastel goth and the the metal matte
live could speak better so that you can
see her review I watched a review it was
fantastic but for me so far I've only
used it twice so I'm not ready to review
it yet
but but yeah it definitely seems
different lives seem to really like it
though but if you want to see the full
breakdown she does some live swatches
and things like that definitely check
out her channel for that dragon rebel
says so many stores are closing because
people shop online that scares me
regarding me because I prefer to see and
touch it in person yeah and I think it's
it's one of those things where I don't
think that my people said that about
books how there were so many ebooks and
audiobooks and things that book stores
we're going to go out of business and
some of them have I mean some of the
smaller bookstores have gone out of
business but I think there's always
going to be something about picking up a
book and reading it from an actual book
I think it's the same thing with going
into a store with whipped makeup that
you know going in and putting your
fingers in it and just watching it I
think that there's something special
about that so let's see I'm gonna
pronounce your name stare hopefully I'm
saying that right Jen I live in the
Netherlands
and I feel like I really miss out on a
lot because of international shipping
and you know what I was talking to there
was a woman that I met in Iceland when
we've traveled there and she was working
in the one of the museum type exhibit
things about aurora borealis and I the
Northern Lights and I was talking to her
about and she she was like I just hate
that I can't get anything here it's like
I'm sorry I wish I could've brought
stuff for you because she was obviously
one of us you know any mean when I was
talking to her I mean her makeup her eye
shadow was like on point like looked
really really good she was so nice like
I just wanted to ship her a bunch of
stuff I now had in hindsight maybe I
could find out I'm like sending her
thinking I'm like brainstorming my head
maybe I can like email the place and say
hey I met this person and that think
that would be creepy though if I was
like if I like email become the the
place and was like hey I met this person
that worked for you and I want to send
her a bunch of makeup and she ever shows
if I want honor on my channel and you
know hopefully she'll show up one day I
did give her a business card cuz I
happened to have him with me but now I'm
like kicking myself like ah man I should
have sent her a box of stuff like
sometimes I think of things way after
the fact this is like back in July
Veronica says Julius place that Ulta
would be so awesome I agree I totally
agree as she said gbas place had the
nubia on sale for $20 yeah they have
some deep sales mon 420 love beauty
anyone ever tried the ace brand shadows
i have i know i haven't if anybody has
definitely leave your comments in either
the comment section below or in the chat
live says Jennie getting the My Little
Pony no no I'm not I'm letting that one
go I don't think that that one speaks to
the majority of my audience I think that
colour-pop is really going like the
forever 21 route kind of thing where the
majority of my audience that I think I
have like maybe 1 to 2% of my audience
is under 18 and then I think it's maybe
20% in the next category and my majority
of my audience is I think 25 to 35 is my
biggest chunk which I think some people
would enjoy it and
at age range but I don't think that I'm
gonna gonna go there I didn't I you know
what I heard that the one from cure was
really good though I missed out on that
but I honestly don't think that it's
it's marketed toward my core audience so
I'm gonna let it go not to say that it's
bad or anything I mean I think that you
should buy what makes you happy and if
all that packaging and that bright and
that that pretty and that cute makes you
happy then you should live says I never
watched my little pony I have I have a
little story for you about my little
pony as I did when I was a kid I watched
the movies on VHS tapes that we rented
at Errol's that's how old I am but I had
a collection of My Little Ponies and I
remember it was right before Christmas
my family took me to the mall and my mom
gave me a penny to throw into the
wishing well and I wished with all my
little heart that I could have all the
My Little Ponies in the world that's all
I wanted I wanted all of my little
ponies in the world and I threw my penny
in and I wished and I wished and I never
got them and then my mom sold them at a
yard sale once I kind of stopped playing
with them my mom sold all my my little
ponies without telling me she sewed them
and I was like oh my gosh but I had to
meet her credit though I hadn't been
playing with them for a while but but
still I really was very much into my
little pony back in the day Steph says
let me tell you those eyeshadows are
worth it they're smaller but pack a
punch and don't take up too much space
oh I wish I know which ones you were
talking about Steph I missed that Ashley
says I want a Starbucks palette lattes
and caramels and creams coffee cinnamon
nutmeg oh my what's the brand that just
came out with a coffee themed palette ah
the one that everybody loves that I I
pushed into my Laura Lee palette review
so ever so Evan just came out with a
coffee themed palette did you see in the
news today this is Oh essence came out
with strawberry-scented makeup it's only
a matter of time before somebody did it
and essence did it and I really want to
try it they have like a little pearls
thing that you can swirl they have a
little eye
shadow palette I want I really want to
try it and it's funny because I always
recommend when people say you know my 10
year old wants to start playing with
makeup my 12 year old wants to dabble in
makeup or whatever I always recommend
essence as a brand for them and I think
that it's perfect for their brand to do
scented makeup
if anybody was going to do it I think
that essence is is definitely a great
brand to do it stare says do you think
the the prism palette is going to be
better than the subculture I really want
to get it you know I haven't watched any
of the reviews I did see that some of
the reviews are coming out they did send
it to influencers a little bit early but
I also saw that tar babies put out her
her review if you've never seen Tara
t-ara be a BYZ I think is wait pronounce
you spell it it's somewhere around there
if you start typing into the search
t-ara ba it'll come up but she is also a
fantastic reviewer I haven't seen it yet
because I was so into the I was really
into doing once of the makeup yesterday
so I haven't washed it yet but I can't
wait to see her thoughts on the on the
only new the prism palette I'm looking
forward to watching it I used to not
watch Oh yep ba BYZ I did get it right I
wasn't gonna say oh so I just ordered it
so it's gonna be a little while Liz says
it's easier to work with
oh nice live so you did get it Oh
wonderful I'm looking forward to review
on your channel of it that's wonderful
did you did you happen to look at the
box at the formula to see whether it had
a short ingredient list or a long one if
it's easier to work with I would imagine
that it's the longer ingredient list
like the not the subculture like the
modern renaissance but that's really a
big reason why I wanted to get is I
wanted to check you know what I could
probably just look online now thinking
about it because they don't think they
hide their ingredients honest Agia like
Kat Von D hides their ingredients
I saw someone said that mani liked it
that's cool good to know Meghan says I
saw manis review and he did a small
comparison cool well we're gonna do
swatches on my channel I don't know if
Liv's gonna do it or not slip those
swatches too but what I want to do is I
have an idea that I want to line up the
three pallets and kind of swatch similar
shades and next to each other
so you can see like and then maybe do
like you know put him in order of like
the ones that are similar forget where
I've seen that before where people put
the shades in a certain order you know
oh I'm probably thinking about the Kat
Von D st. Center pallet help somebody
put them in of like a more usable order
but like do that for the three different
palettes and lay them next to each other
so you can kind of see what's going on
there Arwen says I love watching terrace
halls she has like an epic makeup
collection I would love to meet Chara
one day I know I'm probably never gonna
get to meet Tara one day but I would
love to meet her I'd love to she that
yeah Gail says I trust Chara because
some she and buy so much so she knows
what's good yeah and she's got a very
analytical mind I had somebody tell me
Liv says yes it's similar to saint and
sinner - okay great thank you Liv
yeah one thing it's somebody left on one
of my videos I think it was somebody
that because what I'm finding now is
that people that didn't like my
Jacqueline Hill video they're finding
things
they're like sifting through my other
videos and finding something to nitpick
me about which is fine if you don't like
something that I'm doing I'm totally
like you know you know I'm off for
constructive Chris and definitely tell
me but they're like almost like reaching
and pushing for something in order to to
get me on something but they they said
somebody said something about how
reviews how you can't what was it
I want to get it right she said you know
all that's good in watching a YouTube
video on a makeup is to see the color
range anyway and it's like no there's
actually people that review makeup that
give more valuable information than a
color range you know I was like who have
you been watching you know there's a let
me introduce you to a whole new I'll
show you live loves her makeup and Emily
Noel 83 like Tara baby is and Stephanie
Nicole like let me just give you a list
of like oh yeah I'm not gonna torture
you anymore but anyway you know you know
what I mean like I feel like she's just
missing a whole piece of YouTube makeup
videos you know like there's
much more than just a quick first
impression and you know there's so many
really good videos that give you and
really good channels that give you such
good information before you go and
purchase something and just like wow
girlfriend
expand expands you can do it expand if
it's not my channel I'll give you a ton
of channels you can watch Steph says
please sing all Disney music keep going
Michelle mafia says you need Stephanie
Nicole is one 800 customer service
number number hash tag 1-800 I don't
give a no I love Stephanie I do Megan
says I love love love the detailed
reviews me too me too
but they're not for everybody you know
they're not for everybody and that's
what makes YouTube so wonderful is that
you have the ability to choose whatever
style you personally like Sam says she's
missing honest reviews yeah I mean well
I feel like some of the bigger youtubers
do do honest reviews I think some of
them are hit and miss but you know I
don't just judge someone based on their
size of whether they do a solid review
like for example I know I've talked
about Jackie I know all the time but I
really do adore her she did a review on
the milk makeup line and she put up on
Twitter a photo of her milk emailing
them I mean emailing her and saying hey
and basically kind of responding to some
of the critiques that she had in her
video about the milk makeup line and
they basically said thank you so much
for your feedback and if there's
anything else you want to try from the
line let me know and it's like yes that
is what this is all about that is what
being an influencer is all about in my
mind in my eyes and my perspective it's
okay if you have a different perspective
I'm not saying you're wrong but in my
perspective you know taking a makeup
trying it out giving it a good try and
then giving honest information about it
to the consumer is where I feel like
being an influencer what it's all about
and I was just you know big applause to
both milk makeup and jackie ina for that
i thought that was amazing and i wish
there was more of that but
I'm starting to realize more and more
that there's two camps for makeup videos
there's the camp that's you know all
about the entertainment and really
enjoying just connecting with a person
and really finding a person likeable and
wonderful and amazing and just enjoying
them because you enjoy them and there's
it's just one difference and then
there's the people that just give really
good solid information whether you're
seeking that information and then
there's people that kind of fall in the
middle you know it's not two completely
different camps feel like they kind of
blend in the middle but you know there's
kind of two two routes that you can go
leave these days and I don't feel like
that was always there you know if you
think about you know back to you know
Emmeline Ola III you know is one of the
not to keep bringing her up but she's
one of the oh geez you know from back
that's actually still making videos and
you Marlena from makeup geek but there
really wasn't that entertainment factor
YouTube Beauty video until the last year
or two you know when when like Manny and
Patrick and all of them really really
got big you know of course there's other
reasons to watch them that they have you
know really good makeup skills really
great tutorials things like that but you
know I just feel like that there's more
of a divide now than there ever has been
between those two which is kind of
interesting it's just different it's
just interesting live loves her makeup
says personality channels review
channels and tutorial channels yes and I
feel like yeah I think that's good
that's a good assessment live where
there's like almost like a triangle like
almost like then if you imagine like a
3-way Venn diagram you know where they
can connect where you can have tutorial
channel that's also has a lot of
personality or you can have a review
channel that also does really good
tutorials which is like Emily you know
and I feel like yeah definitely I think
that's a really like your your
perspective better than mine I like that
I like that that's a good point
Steph says I actually say this all the
time but I purge my subscriber list I
got rid of 95% of Beauty youtubers
because I realized all the vids are the
same yeah I think a lot of people are
with you on that Monica wants to know if
I can do a lock for review I don't think
I'm gonna do one at this point honestly
because it's been out for a while and I
wouldn't be able to get it up probably
late November and I think it's kind of
past the point at that point which makes
me sad but I definitely recommend
checking out Emily's video if you
haven't already because it's I trust her
a hundred percent for real dad says
what's wrong with me
that I don't trust the big guys from
YouTube now it's just your gut feeling
and I feel like no matter who you're
watching whether it's me whether it's
somebody else I feel like you need to go
with your gut of whether you trust that
person or not and if you no longer trust
someone then you shouldn't you know can
say you should consider on subscribing I
think you you have to go with your gut
on that Jenny says I love Emily Noelle
does lots more affordable brands and
products she's true to where she camp
camp comes from yeah and I feel like I'm
Jessica bronze the same way absolutely
you know that they still do a lot of
drugstore stuff I really need to put
more drugstore stuff in my videos
I've bought drugstore stuff to review
but it keeps getting pushed by these big
hyped up releases and I feel like you
know the that my thoughts are what do
people want to see the most and when I
veered off to do drugstore stuff you
know in the past like way in the past
cuz it's been a while those videos don't
seem to get as many views which to me is
a message to me that that's content that
the majority of my audience doesn't want
to see so you know what what gets a lot
of views which tells me that people want
to see it are the big lines like
two-face Fenty you know those Sephora
brand brands but I know there's an
audience out there for a drugstore it's
just picking the right products and
there's so many products to choose from
and because there aren't a lot of videos
kind of guiding me what what products
people are really interested in it's
harder for me to decide what drugstore
products to feature so what I really
need to do is I need to use my Facebook
group as a resource and find out what
products people are mostly interested in
if you don't know I do have a Facebook
group
it's groups com facebook.com slash group
slash what's up in makeup and I do get a
lot of information from them as far as
what they're interested in but I think
that would be a good poll to do you know
when when I once the stuff calms down
maybe in December end of November early
December and find out what people are
really excited about drugstore wise and
do some reviews on that stuff because I
think that that would be better to bring
to my channel I would really like to do
that and I think will be valuable let's
see what people are saying always live
leaving buy live thanks so much for
being here I appreciate you Michelle my
Belle said something let's go back and
see what she said everybody's saying
Amen she says everyone does those brands
though yeah I agree I agree and but
those are the ones that people watch so
that's kind of where I'm going is you
know when I got I went to generation
Beauty in New York and we have the
creator day where they talk about
strategies and things and the best panel
was the last one and one thing they said
is you know you it's all about return on
investment for time you know you want to
spend your time doing the things that
your audience really likes and the way
to gauge what your audience really likes
is number one the likes and number two
by how many views you get on a video so
if your videos aren't getting a lot of
views then consider not doing those
types of views any videos anymore and go
toward the type of videos that are
getting a lot of views because your
audience apparently really likes those
videos so I know a lot of people did the
two-faced peaches and cream collection
but at the same time I think that people
wanted to hear what I said about it just
because I would think I take on a
different perspective than a lot of
channels so I think people wanted to
know what I thought and that video did
get a lot of views my goal on the
channel is to get anywhere from 8,000 to
12,000 views a video and that one got 10
at least so far the Laura Lee videos at
10 so that tells me that that's content
that I need to continue with on my
channel like I talked about last week
I'm probably going to kind of what the K
is going to be kind of not phased out
but I'm gonna do less of them because
they don't get a lot of views and I know
the people that watch them really really
enjoy them so I do want to keep doing
them because I personally really like
them but they're very expensive to
produce and then I'm spending 10 to 20
dollars a week on you know products for
that video and
I'm not making back a quarter of that in
my revenue for it and I'm not getting a
lot of views on it which shows me that
the audience the the big audience that I
have like the the you know looking at
the whole they're just not really that
into those videos so kind of is what it
is
Ashley says it's killing me how mean
people are being to cast after her
doctor's debut oh yeah I saw that and
I've been texting back and forth with
Cassie Cassie from thrift thik if you
don't know Cassie and I met years ago
where I had had a contest for
up-and-coming youtubers it was a thing
that I done on my old channel it was
called Jenna love 37 I'd done a contest
like this I decided to bring a contest
to this channel of like three years ago
something like that where we I took
youtubers that had under a certain
number of subscribers I forget how many
and I put them
I had them create videos to kind of
battle against each other so maybe it
would be a five minute makeup challenge
and they had to all create a 5 minute
makeup challenge and then people would
watch their videos and then go vote on
which one which person did the best and
they would vote in the comments of my
video and then I would tally up the
votes
and then people be eliminated like a
reality TV show so Cassie was in that
and she got second place the person who
got first place stopped making videos
like a couple months after the contest
ended which was really odd but Cassie
kept going and her channel eventually
got really big before it got big though
I actually met her I met in New York I
believe and we spent a couple hours
together and hung out and we exchanged
numbers and we keep in touch every once
in a while kind of checking in on each
other and seeing how each other are
doing and it made me really sad to hear
that she's struggling with so many
things emotionally it made me really sad
because she just seems like such a
wonderful person and it breaks my heart
that that people are so cool you know
it's it's one thing to offer
constructive criticism it's another
thing to really like tell people you
know I don't even want to repeat some of
the things that are being said to her I
mean you kicking someone while they're
down you know it's obvious she's having
a tough time with something but then you
just nail at her again and again and
again it's like you know lay off just
lay off you know and it bothers me it
really bothers me so you know and before
anybody said no I'm gonna go there
because I know people are gonna say you
know something about my Jacqueline Hill
video and you know but I didn't see what
I said is being that bad I didn't say
anything about her looks her voice you
know things that she can't change about
who she is as a person it was a critique
of a video it was a totally different
situation in my opinion but I know
people are gonna come at me about that
after what I just said so I just want to
address that but I hope she texted me
back this morning that she's doing okay
but it kills me man it kills me when
people are when somebody is obviously so
down in the dumps and then they just get
bam bam just kills me man
92 May her and says Jen first time here
always watch after love your reviews
thank you so much I really appreciate
that Michelle my Belle says I really
like the Jacqueline Hill video thank you
very much I not sure if I liked it last
offensive whether I liked that one or
not but about five to one people do like
that video so you know as far as the
likes go so it's really one of those
things where people people either got it
or they didn't and a lot of people
really didn't like it and I totally
completely respect that opinion and I
would still have comments open if people
could not go for those super low blows
which I can't take the super low blows
once once people start doing the super
low blows I got it I gotta cut it off so
let's say Valerie says can I ask you
kind of a personal question have you
been hit by the D monetization thing no
not once
knock on fake wood my little end table
here I have not been hit by demonisation
the D monetization not with one video
ooh okay someone else approved it good
there was a comment no yeah so no I
haven't and I think it's just because my
my titles and my tags and things are not
in any way they're not triggering the
the the YouTube filters you know
community Q&amp;amp;A isn't gonna trigger
anything but it's weird and the things
that that are triggering it if you don't
know this you can kind of go into it by
looking up YouTube D monetization videos
and people talk about you know what's
being commoditized like for example
there was a really really big creator
named Casey nice tat that had a video
demonetised because he was doing a he
was donating all of the proceeds of his
video to I forget which which charity I
think it was that was it the taxes when
there's been so many tragedies lately
I'm not sure which tragedy he was
donating his Percy's to I want to say
that it was the the Texas the families
in Texas and oh not Texas my gosh Las
Vegas goodness sorry I was reading about
Texas earlier today Las Vegas and his
video was demonetised
because he talked about the log in the
title he said Las Vegas shooting or
something like that
so we couldn't donating the money
because look YouTube you do monetize it
and they said I'm sorry we can't we
can't monetize your video in your videos
that talk about this topic but so then
he screen captured a Late Night with
Jimmy Fallon or you know one of those
late night shows where they talked about
it and it was monetized so there's
something going on there something going
on there
Vanessa says totally different Jenn if
you put out a product people can review
it people shouldn't be allowed to review
someone's actual life yeah someone's
actual life I think that kind of depends
I don't know I don't like to say what
people are allowed would any not allowed
to do I think it just kind of depends on
the topic like if like I'm thinking like
Philip DeFranco off the top of my head
if you don't know him he's another og
youtuber that I've been following
forever I met him many many years ago
when he was still dating his wife when
actually was in they first started
dating like he is he talked about like
current events
like things that happen he has like his
douche bag of the day so I feel like
that is kind of reviewing someone's
actual life in a way so I feel like I
don't know I don't know I don't know I
think that it just it's it's such a gray
area I think that if you are I don't
know it's such a gray area I don't I
don't want to make a habit of reviewing
people's actual lives but you know I
think everyone should be allowed to
express their opinions on how they feel
especially if it's done respectfully I
know people are gonna say I wasn't
respect to little Jacqueline Hill and
you know I get it I get it I hear you I
hear you get it I'm like thing you're
thinking of the the comments in my head
yeah he does and it's mostly people that
have done terrible things terrible
things the douche bag of the day Erica
says I feel like other like people began
going after Cassie because of that other
girl who followed her you know the
racist one and it's unfair you are not
responsible for your followers yeah that
was a big thing especially in you know
the underground of Reddit and you gossip
her and all of that yeah definitely
Michele mafia says you have to be strong
personality to be on YouTube people hide
behind you not the anonymous to be
purposely mean I want to fight someone
every five minutes yeah you do I mean
you have to you do have to have a level
of maturity and an ability to kind of
cut yourself off and it it definitely
can be hard and sometimes things get to
you but it only gets more intense the
more followers you get it gets more and
more intense so I can't even imagine you
know the things that you know Laura and
Manny and Patrick and you know desi and
you know the militant that all the
people that are have huge followings how
much craziness they have to read in
their comments Ricky says to an extent
someone's life matters and that it can
give you ideas as their personality and
honestly yeah definitely I agree Shelby
says I love raw beauty Christy yes I do
too raw beauty Christy was my my
obsession during the NYX face awards
last year I was like hardcore promoting
her stuff if you look back on my
Instagram channel my Instagram feed you
see like me promoting her last year I
was like she is gonna blow up she is
gonna blow up and then she she didn't
she didn't blow up after the next face
of words and I was shocked because she's
so insanely talented and then recently
her channel has done so well and I'm so
excited for Christy I did meet Christy
once as well it was brief though but I
got to meet her and she was such a
sweetheart
kiddo Lynn says Jen I've been watching
for about two years you always try to
look at all points of view and are super
careful before you speak I think you do
a great job thank you for all your hard
work I can't say I'm always super
careful before I speak I try to be but
you know everybody makes mistakes
nobody's perfect I was reading um Alyssa
Ashley on Twitter and she was kind of
saying that you know if you expect me to
be perfect then you have an unrealistic
expectation of who you know of what
you're expecting me to be because I'm
not perfect I'm gonna make mistakes and
that's the way that I feel about me too
you know I feel like people you know
they they almost can't some people not
everybody but some people can't separate
the difference between YouTube and the
television character you know between me
and someone they may watch in a sitcom
you know the difference is is their
their fake person they're not real they
were created in a scripts and read by an
actor where I am a real person same
thing with the reality TV shows reality
TV shows a lot of that is you know maybe
not necessarily a hundred percent
scripted and that they have a script to
follow and they read the lines but you
know they're kind of told you know to go
here and do this and have this argument
sometimes my husband has been asked to
be on ink masters multiple times and
he's turned it down every time because
they edit the doodoo out of those things
to make people look a certain way and
he's not willing to risk his reputation
entrust them to take care of him to make
sure he comes out of it looking like you
know an amazing person because they're
gonna edit everything to fit their
agenda they don't care about the people
that are on that show at least that's
what we're thinking and that's why he
turns it down every time so you know if
you didn't know my husband's a tattoo
artist we own a tattoo studio which is
why I don't have to make a ton of money
on you
- been ordered people to live because my
Osman owns a successful tattoo business
that he built from scratch when he was
24 he opened that business and I am very
very proud of him
Tasha says I never understand why people
feel entitled to tell others what they
can and can't say I loved your Dragon
Hill video you're very thoughtful and
respectful well thank you Tasha and
there is that opinion that you know you
got it you got it Tasha and other people
didn't and other people were very upset
and I I understand it the people that
were upset are not alone there are
thousands of people that were upset well
at least a thousand least a thousand
maybe two that we're upset with that
video so it's a very valid opinion to
not have liked that video but I I mean I
feel like people were saying Tasha to go
with your point she says I feel like
people aren't why people feel they're
intended to tell others what they can
and can't say I think people
misinterpreted like when I said I hate
the word affordable I think that was
misinterpreted and me trying to say
Jaqueline can't use the word affordable
that wasn't what I was trying to say I
was trying to say in order to appeal to
a larger audience you may want to not
use that word as much because it can
make people who don't have a lot of
money feel isolated in that if you show
something like a $38 eyeshadow palette
plus seven dollars shipping and you say
that it's affordable and you're sitting
here with your $20 in your pocket you
know that you are barely scraping by and
like dude that's not affordable you know
any mean like and then you're kind of
isolating people so was more it was a
suggestion it was a suggestion based
video not a telling her what to do video
and that part of the reason why it came
across that way was my delivery sucked
so I take full responsibility for my
delivery sucking on it but that wasn't
my intention like someone went and found
and old what the K of mine and said you
know when someone said you know that I
had used the word affordable and that
video was comparing the Missha BB cream
to the Too Faced Born This Way and I had
said the Mesha was more affordable than
the Too Faced which it is more
affordable it isn't necessarily
affordable to everybody but it is more
affordable so I mean it gets real
nitpicking it gets really really
nitpicky it was just a stinking
suggestion you know and it was just
blown out of proportion there were a lot
of things I wish I could have done
differently
with that video a lot of things but I
still don't regret the underlying
message of it in that we need to do
better I still think that that message
needs to be out there in my opinion
that's my opinion I have a right to and
if people are totally ok with Jacqueline
Hill you know doing the kinds of videos
where she's not really going you know
obviously people are okay with her doing
videos where she's not going in depth
like I mean nobody people going in depth
to the level I get in depth nobody wants
to do that who wants to do that
sometimes I don't even want to do that
but I feel like I need to you know
because that's what I do
you know people it she's millions of
subscribers obviously people like what
she's doing so does she should she be
listening to me no could she if she
wanted to sure she doesn't want you
shouldn't have a listen me I get it it's
cool it's totally cool Annie says hi
Annie how are you my friend the beauty
news girls from Australia I've mentioned
you a few times calling you a hypocrite
because you have used the word on your
channel they said you came from a good
place
yeah I'm not sure what to say about the
beauty news ladies you know it I have to
tell you that the beauty news lady is
and I have been on good terms for a
while I've had a feeling that cat has
had a problem with me for a while but I
had a conversation with Haley on
Facebook I want to say it was like May
something like that and we got to a
really good place where we were both on
the same page we both agreed that our
like their new show and my new show even
though mine came out years before theirs
that we were not in competition really
because they their shows completely
different than mine it's like the view
reminds more like news it's a totally
different thing so Haley and I came to a
really great great place and then they
spent about ten minutes of their
beginning of one of their videos I don't
know how much of it was talking about me
but basically running me through the mud
and it's okay they have a they have a
total right to their opinion and they
have a total right to share their
opinion about that they didn't agree
with what I did
I wish that they hadn't I don't know I
feel like that they were a little bit it
was harsh man it was harsh and I feel
like it you know I hate to say this but
this is what I'm feeling it was a little
hypocritical to criticize me for going
after Jacqueline Hill which I didn't
really go after her I just offered a few
suggestions and then go after me so hard
you know it's like why would you why
would you say it's not okay to go after
youtubers and target specific youtubers
and then target me in that the same
thing like that's just that's just my
thoughts I don't know I don't know I
just think that that's kind of messed up
but I haven't talked to them since I am
a part of their Facebook group I read
all the comments where it was mostly cat
talking about how terrible of a person I
am she has a right to her opinion
and she doesn't know me I've never
spoken her I don't think I've spoken to
her at all I mostly talked to Haley
Haley seems super nice but Haley wasn't
really I mean it she's thought she said
she didn't agree with what I did but I
feel like she was a little less harsh
than cow it was if you ever seen you if
you've never seen Beauty news it's
actually a very interesting show that
they put up and I would definitely
recommend you check it out if you are
interested in kind of expanding on what
I do and finding hearing more opinions
about it about products coming out they
have like a you know more of a
discussion about it and it's a really
good show so if you want to go over and
check out beauty news feel free I mean I
think that there's a lot to be gained
from the content on their Channel so but
it's up I mean you know I can't I can't
I can't I can't sit here and cry over
that you know cat from Beauty News hates
me apparently realize it but maybe
shouldn't hate me but the thing is then
they put this little disclaimer about
how they have nothing but respect for me
and then they completely disrespect me
which makes no sense I think they put in
that after when they realized how tough
they were on me well we'll just put a
little disclaimer in there and people
will realize we're okay with her but no
it's this doesn't work like that you
can't say you respect someone and then
say really nasty things about them and
the things that they're saying in the
comments of the people that are agreeing
with them like the things they're saying
about me and their common
it's horrible it's absolutely horrible
Annie says I don't appreciate how they
went about it I was shocked to hear your
name on the same sentence just watch out
for their language they do they do cuss
a lot but some people like that I don't
but some people like it you know it's
it's all about being different and it's
okay it's okay to have different
perspectives it's okay to have different
news channels I don't cuss on my channel
that's something I chose to do as a
mother first as a teacher because I
couldn't because if my students heard me
cussing it would be terrible then when I
stopped teaching as a mother I want
other mothers to be able to watch my
channel without worrying that a cuss
word is gonna drop out because I've been
watching youtubers and might you know
listening to videos and my kids are
running around and then cuss words just
start flying out of their mouths and
it's like oh my gosh volume down volume
down I want I want my eyes to be able to
watch their well I want mom to be able
to watch my channel with their kids or
with their kids around so that's why I
choose but that's not the same choice
for everybody and that's what makes this
world a wonderful place as we can all
choose to do we wanted to do you know
mine love beauty says gosh I'm so sorry
you were the two channels I loved the
most hey I wasn't thrown about how they
were talking about you yeah I'm not
thrilled about it either but it's there
right it's there right and I'm not
trying to start a war between me and
beauty news you know Shauna says home G
my next-door neighbor is DJ who just won
the ink master he's amazing oh that's
cool I haven't watched ink masters in a
long time Arman wants to know why I shut
the app down because the people who ran
the app or were not they were not good
people to work with I did not have a
good business relationship with them
they still you know I kiss people there
was the paid section that I never wanted
in the first place they were supposed to
be paying me money off the paid section
they never did
so it was like I yeah that's why I
killed the app the app was terrible and
the Facebook group has replaced the app
my what's been makeup Facebook group is
everything I want the app to be so it's
fine
Elijah says you're so classy Jen really
walking the walk was respecting other
people's opinions well but that's what
my heart is it's one of those things
where you have to go with where your
heart is you know and that's I I'm just
being
you know and I was genuinely respect
other people's opinions and I think that
was the big fail in my Jacqueline Hill
video is that I was seeing things
impulsively from my own perspective and
didn't take time to see things that from
other people's perspective and if I had
done that I would have done that video
in a different way Katie says Jen well
think of it this way any publicity works
as long as they spell your channel name
right yeah I guess personally I'd rather
them just not trash me but you know
that's their right if their channel they
can do what they want with it they also
use the c-word to talk about their their
people on their Facebook group which I
would never do I would never never use
the C word to describe people like the
collective brain can you imagine if I
just drop the c-word you don't have a
c-word I can't even I I hate that word I
can't even like it
but everybody's different and it's okay
like I'm sitting here like I go over in
my face book hunters group and I go
through and I make sure I credit every
single person that helps me every single
week on the show from the Facebook
hunters group that's where people from
the app that we're submitting things
from the app I started the Facebook
hunters group which you can find linked
under what's it been makeup and I credit
them and I thank them for their
contributions for the week and they're
calling them the c-word and I'm the bad
guy I'm the bad guy
I'm the disrespectful one I don't know
tam-tam yes you typed the word correctly
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say it it is
it is one an hour and two minutes in so
I should probably get off here but
Veronica says the fact that you acquire
your acknowledge your mistakes helps you
grow Jenna I totally agree
it was just delivery everything else was
on Thank You Veronica and I feel the
same way at this point and you know I am
all about owning up to my mistakes where
I make a mistake I will tell you and
even if it's a stupid mistake like like
not stupid mistakes but like little
mistakes like like for example in the
Laura Lee video I'm just gonna say one
last point the Laura Lee video the
colour-pop information in there is wrong
because colour-pop gave me the wrong
information and you know what
this is funny because I learned this on
the beauty news group because they were
talking about it that the information is
right on the colour-pop website what
happens is if you go to the colour-pop
website it's like information
information and that's where I was
looking for it and then there's a video
beyond the video is all of the specs of
how many grams everything is and I
thought the video was the end of the
page and I was you know I'm trying to
finish the video up you know finish up
the research so I could film because I
have to film before my kids get off the
bus and I just didn't scroll that far to
see the specs for the colour-pop stuff
was right stinkin there that was my
fault that was my responsibility to
scroll all the way to the bottom of the
page and I didn't but I'll take
responsibility for that I did it I
messed up on that on the colour-pop
information and they're like well
somebody said on there well maybe she
just doesn't do the research that that
she says that she does and then there's
like 15 thumbs up on that comment and
it's like really you know there's one in
assumption what an assumption well maybe
I was rushing to film so I could pick my
kids up from the bus stop and just
didn't scroll all the way down to the
page because I really needed to film how
about that cuz that's the truth but
anyway you know it's all I think it's
really really important number one to
own up when you make a mistake and just
say look I messed up I could have done
it better and then learn from it move on
and then number two to realize there's
more going on than what you see on a
camera there's always more going on so
Lewis says I think your Jacqueline Hill
was a hundred percent accurate thank you
thank you I just wish I'd done it in a
different way because I think it would
have been received better there was a if
I if I can find the video there was a
person that did a video she's got a
smaller channel and I can't remember
what her name is
but she did a video kind of similar to
what I did but she did it way better and
I was like wow props to her man props to
her I wish I could remember who it was
oh if I can find it I'll link in the
description under here but Annie says we
love you Jen you're so honest and human
thank you my friend
Sadie says I understand what you're
trying to do with the Jacquelyn home
video I think the video could have been
more refined but I think you were being
that I don't think you were being
disrespectful you have a right to you
piÃ±on thank you I feel like at times I
was edging on disrespectful like kind of
like the the exacerbation you know was
was edging on disrespectful and I think
that's why people took it the wrong way
it was the tone like I said it was the
tone I messed up on the tone alright
I'm gonna pop off here oh let me just
read from latina because I adore her it
says you um you know very well this C
word means cute another way can we take
it as long as you are cute much loving
with Tina and Julio down by the
schoolyard all right I love you guys
thank you so much for being here I
really enjoyed having just an open Q&amp;amp;A
talk with you guys it's really a lot of
fun I enjoy it if you have any questions
or comments or you know anything and
you're in the live chat this will be
rendered in about 15 minutes or so and
then you can feel free to come back and
leave your thoughts cuz of course I
can't read all of the comments and if
you're watching us in the replay I love
to hear your thoughts it's a lot easier
to be heard when you speak respectfully
though it's a lot easier when you when
you present yourself in a respectful way
without insulting people it's a lot
easier to be heard we're not all perfect
but being on a keyboard you do have the
ability to kind of backspace and you
know just so you know because I know
people are gonna be mad again about the
Jaclyn hill thing I know I can already
feel it coming I can feel it coming in
the end oh all right it's way past time
I'll talk to you guys soon mad love
thanks for being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
