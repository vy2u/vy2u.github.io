my friends welcome to the what to the
make up chats I am very excited because
I got myself a microphone so that the
sound will be better for Chad I'm hoping
and I've got my Johnny Depp t-shirt I'm
excited about that
if you did not see my Hot Topic haul I
explained why I have a Johnny Depp
t-shirt while guess I kind of did I just
used to love crybaby when I was a kid so
I got myself a Johnny Depp t-shirt as an
impulse buy it happened I had like an
extra minute so I put on some eyeshadow
and this is all off topic because I'm
super sleepy this eyeshadow is the dose
of colors the little duo though the like
yellow one and I'm really digging it I'm
having fun with it but it's just really
light makeup so I just have to make sure
I don't yell and I think we're going to
be okay can't get too excited right so
before we start the live chat disclaimer
if you we're going to be decluttering
the rest of my eyeshadow palette
collection and I think all we have left
is blushes and I think we're done so
pretty much we've got like a random
drawer of like brow products that I may
or may not do on camera maybe maybe I
don't know if it's going to happen if
it's we run out of time we won't do it
but just to disclaimer before we just
declutter that I will be discussing my
choices with the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness also known as the
people who are here in live chat and the
reason why I am talking to them is
because I've invited them into my home
and I feel that's the nice thing to do
and also I love talking to them
I love getting their opinions I love
getting their thoughts and I feel like
that their opinions are valuable so if
you're watching this on the replay and
you do not like this format I do
apologize but that's the way that I
chose to do my declutter zand I'm really
sorry and next time I declutter in a
year so I might or might not do it like
this I don't know I haven't cited its
year from now not making any commitments
right now so so yes I'm going to go
ahead and take a moment to say hello to
the collective brain very quickly and
then we're going to go ahead and
declutter so okay so first people here
Felicia oh is in the homes Jamie is here
sushi
panacea Stephanie is here Tiffany hello
Nancy hello Cheyenne what's up
girlfriend Cheyenne is here and trances
Jenna's decluttering eyeshadows and I'm
getting ready to buy that Urban Decay
palette that's half off hey I just got a
couple - I got the Pirates of the
Caribbean I've been really enjoying that
and then I got that supernatural palette
that I put up on on I did a live stream
just impromptu so I'm buying - by the
way I used the supernatural power
yesterday and it was not that bad I was
expecting it to be worse it was actually
better performing than some of the other
eyeshadow palettes ivory lately as far
as like the shade from the that one
green shade from the deck of scarlet it
the supernatural palette is better than
that it's crazy and that was a $15
palette but anyway so that was kind of
interesting that it actually kind of
worked let's see who else is here sushi
pan says I've been watching so much
decluttering videos they prevent me from
buying too much stuff that's nice
hello Astin so good to see you and dark
Lassa Lassa Lassa good morning to you
Lisa
good morning Stevie's girl the morning
to you and reading mom good morning to
you and Michelle and I did see and
Sydney's here and I did see that Tabitha
is floating around here - so good
morning to you and good morning to you
if I did not say good morning good
morning to you I feel like I want to
sing like a like a song that I used to
sing to kindergartners I'm not gonna do
it it just you know how things get
ingrained in your brain but anyway let's
go ahead and start with this
decluttering so we've got about half a
bag left in here it's filled to about
here so Angie says I'm her favorite oh
thank you so much I appreciate it thank
you okay so we've got first thing in
here is the Velvet 59 exotic Lotus
palette these palettes were pretty good
they were pretty good
this shade princess of China was not my
favorite it was kind of a wash of color
I really did enjoy that shade I don't
see myself reaching for this a whole lot
even though it's a pretty good eyeshadow
palette so I'm probably gonna pass this
on to someone that will use it more
because I don't see myself really
pulling for it I just realized I don't
have a box I have a bomb
downstairs my Hot Topic box and I forgot
so I'm just have to make a pile there's
not a whole lot this week
okay this is a blacks the black skinny
eyeshadow palette by larog I really
really like this but again I'm not
reaching for it and I think someone else
would get more use for it so that's like
good morning Baltimore yeah I know
that's another from another guy oh my
goodness just happy thank you so much
for activating the super chat in such a
massive way that is so nice of you thank
you that was really really nice thank
you I'm not gonna buy anything for a
little while because I have bought a lot
but I put I'll put you into my
spreadsheet and huge shout out thank you
just happy I really appreciate that so
so we're going to declutter this one
because I just don't I don't pull for it
I think someone else is going to love it
more that was really really nice thank
you so much right off the jump to
lunatick cosmetic labs this is something
I'm definitely keeping this is the what
is this which palette is this um the
super natural eyeshadow palette this
does not have to do with the show but
this is an amazing eyeshadow palette I
really want to try more from lunatic
labs I've really been enjoying their
formula I wish their eyeshadow palettes
had more shades in it though I mean I
feel like five shades is good but I wish
that they had more in them but you know
you can't have everything I know some
people aren't going to like the
packaging because of the whole Ouija
board thing and I totally understand
that I personally don't have a problem
with it with my personal meanness so I
personally really like it I think it's
super cute so I'm going to go ahead and
keep that one definitely
okay the revealed smoky palette this is
one I'm not sure what I'm going to do
with because it is seriously a dupe for
the Urban Decay smoky palette which I
already own I did just do it just
swatches on that and I don't ever pull
for it like very very rarely do I pull
for it
but this one does have some different
shades in it I know I'm not going to
pull for it but then there's something I
don't know but I did get rid of the
revealed three palette I'm never going
to reach this I'm going to pass this on
I'm going to pass it on because I know
someone's going to love it more than I
do
and pass it on this is something I'm
going to keep
lunatic labs is what it's called MLA
lunatic labs lunatick cosmetic labs
you'll find it Tina says vintage your
tacky loves that brand it's a great
brand Roe says I love John Waters I know
divine is divine John Waters is well you
know he's a local guy for me I do love
John Waters the guy who did cry-baby a
little bit of off type of conversation
it happens in chat Jamie says and I'm
Tasha Dona has a new palette coming out
it looks very warm toned I probably
won't be getting it and Tasha - Nona's
out of my price range I do have one of
the big pallets that was gifted to me
but and then I have one of the small
ones that I broke down and bought but it
pained me to buy it because it was so
expensive it was like Oh Andy is Natasha
- no and I mean um excuse me
Stef's I have a slave session with Ouija
boards planchette Lee oh you're funny
stuff okay so anyway this is we go back
rewind okay so this is the galaxy chic
palette and I called it the galaxy chick
palette forever until tap those like you
cannot call that the galaxy chick
palette is a galaxy chic palette i'ma go
okay fine so now I cook sushi palette
and it's got some gorgeous colors this
is deadly my favorite BH Cosmetics
palette of all time I love it it is
really really good the four four BH
Cosmetics it's not lunatic labs quality
okay it's not this quality it's a little
bit powdery err but the shades are very
vibrant they're very easy to use and I
really enjoy them Lucy says watching
from the UK thank you so much Lucy Takei
says kimberly-clark talks about lunatic
a lot I think okay um let's see I'm just
reading comments okay so yeah so this is
a definite win this is on sale a lot at
the H Cosmetics so if these colors call
to you I definitely recommend picking it
up if you like these bright bold colors
it's a really fun palette to play with
really enjoy it a lot okay this is one
the miss fabulous palette by Ulta and
Jenny Fox I did I did a full review on
this I'm never going to pull for this I
know I'm never going to pull for it I'm
going to go ahead and pass it on it's
kind of mediocre and that's what I said
in the
it's just kind of it you can get a look
out of it but it's definitely not fun to
play with you know what I mean Karen I
think Karen wants me to swatch the
galaxy chic let me let me go ahead and
get to swatch a few for you will do Sun
Jupiter Prometheus and Aphrodite will do
these warm once in swarms or so in right
now I think they're on their way up I
think people are getting tired of worms
but I mean BH Cosmetics really BH
Cosmetics really really BH Cosmetics
mmm-hmm amazingness amazingness they're
really good and they're all like that
they're all like that they're really
nice so I'm going to go ahead and keep
that one Seth says pass along the Ulta
pallets RN yeah they are they're very an
all right meet matte nude this is one
that I will be passing on well know I
was thinking this was the original meet
mat the meet matte nude I'm gonna
definitely going to keep because I feel
like I reach for this every once in a
while like it comes up in my brain is
something that I want to use especially
this matte Lombardi because I don't
think I have anything else that's like
this like butter eating a buttery but
it's like a I guess it's like a dusty
yellow kind of shade I really like it a
lot it's beautiful and also this matte
Tseng shade is really nice and matte
Abdullah's very interesting that hung is
very interesting they're just
interesting neutral shades I know a lot
of people don't reach for this they talk
about they buy and then they don't reach
for it and I feel the same way I feel
absolutely the same way but I do pull
forward every once a while when I think
I just need this shade or I just need
this shade or whatever this shade right
here I have quite a few shades that are
like that but it's really high-quality I
have a just swatches on this if you want
to see more about that palette all right
what's next the lorac Pro palette I
honestly don't reach for this that often
but it is a really good high quality
palette and I think it's great to have
for reference purposes to compare it to
other palettes and things even though I
don't reach for it much my sister-in-law
gave this to me which I was really it
was really nice of her she wasn't using
it so she gave it to me but I'm
definitely keeping it because it's full
of pro palette I feel like I need to
have it as part of the collection
Abey in wonderland Jen you should do a
pan that palette it would encourage you
to reach for stuff okay so let me let me
address that Abby I don't do project
pans and things like that because I am
constantly having to review new products
so in order for me to do a project I
would never I would lose I would lose
miserably because like for example I'm
working on the Pirates of the Caribbean
palette right now that I'm working on
for review but the week before that you
know I was working on the natural love
palette and before that I was working on
the Tarte palette so I try to use them
for a full week you know I use them at
least three or four times before I
review them so that doesn't leave much
room for the palette to already have and
when I do have time like to use a
palette that's not a palette I'm using
for a review I try to pick something
that I love something that's calling to
me it's like oh I want to use my Alice
in Wonderland palette today you know
what I mean like there's that when
you're like oh I haven't used this in a
while I want to use it so project pans
just don't work for me but I totally get
that they work for a lot of people I'm
definitely in the minority there
Christina says Jen do you have any
recommendations for good drugstore
liquid liners it's a little bit off
topic let me um let me think
well I'm reaching for the next palette
the Maybelline it's the Maybelline pen
liner
I can't thing on what it's called I
haven't owned it in a while because it
died on me and because it was old and I
didn't repurchase it what I suggest you
do if you have questions like that about
specific products that don't have to do
with the eyeshadow palettes is go over
to my facebook group which is groups
facebook.com slash group slash what's up
and makeup ask any question you want and
within 10-15 minutes you will have about
10-15 at least answers they're really
fast over there they're really good if I
think of it all I'll tell you what it is
but I'm pretty sure it's Maybelline the
one I'm thinking about top my head but
I'm like not on that train of thought
right now but Stevie says the Physicians
Formula I boost your pen the black one
not the brown one in my opinion
so the blackberry seduction truffle
seduction this was part of a set I never
reach for the
so I'm gonna pass that along even though
the purple in there is really nice this
is what I'm going to keep for a
nostalgia purpose it's because I was so
excited to get this this is the lorac
mint Edition so excited to get this and
I was so happy with it it's really not
very good quality the mint in here isn't
nearly as good as the avocado toast it's
in the rock of the new one the brunch
one so I mean these shades are kind of
mediocre but because I just love this
color selection and I wanted it so bad
I'm just going to keep it because I
don't know why I have a sentimental
attachment to it I guess because I
wanted it and I wanted and I wanted it
and I finally got it and I was so
excited about it I don't know okay this
is a limited edition wet-and-wild
palette this is the color icon palette
in let's see nude awakening this was a
limited edition this is a fantastic
eyeshadow palette I don't know why wet
and well makes their best eyeshadow
palettes Limited Edition it makes no
sense to me it's fantastic Oh Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner it's my favorite
but I don't see that as being as
drugstore when I think about drug star
think about I'm walking into a drugstore
and I'm buying it but I can never find
the Jesse's girl on my Walgreens or Rite
Aid Rite Aid
can never find it so I just don't count
it but jess is your liquid liner is
probably it's it may not be my favorite
anymore though but that'll that's for
another day but anyway this is a
wonderful let me swatch some of these
for you these are fantastic I don't
reach for it very often but I'm gonna
have a hard time getting rid of it it's
not swatching that great today
it's been a while since I've reached for
it I'm going to have to maybe I don't
know about this now now I'm looking at
the swatches I'm gonna have to try this
I might declutter this now hmmm I
remember it being amazing but just
watched a little bit weird so oh alright
Kat Von D interstellar palette sherry
you are crazy I love you sherry thank
you so much that was extremely generous
thank you so much I don't know what I I
don't know what I did to deserve it but
I do really appreciate it thank you so
much thank you thank you thank you
sherry sherry activated super Chad if
you're watching this on replay thank you
very
much that was really nice of you um the
it's like I
Ashley thank you so much thank you
Ashley um people are watching this on
replay or gonna get so annoyed with me
but I feel the obligation to say thank
you people do it actually that was
really nice of you thank you
interstellar by Kat Von D guys are
making me shake my head don't make me
cry again this week this is a palette
that I rarely reach for but I feel like
I need it for my collection if not for
these two purple shades especially this
lavender shade I oh nothing like this
lavender shade it is buttery and amazing
I'll swatch the two purple shades
because these are just if this ever gets
decluttered it's going to go to my
sister-in-law Amy because she is
obsessed with purples but aren't those
beautiful they're so pretty so pretty I
love those so I'm going to keep this one
and it's nice to have as a reference
point two for Kat Von D shadows here's
another wet and wild this one's really
really old but I'm going to keep it
anyway this is the comfort zone palette
you can get this this is one of their
staple palettes it's wonderful
especially for a drugstore eyeshadow
palette I'm going to run out of room for
swatches here let's go to the other arm
here we'll do the deeper row here
hopefully you guys can see this but
that's the comfort zone palette by wet
and wild and it's wonderful if you're
looking for a good green brown or green
blue blue brown blue brown yeah blue
Brown this one right here I feel like I
just wiped away some of the it's mostly
brown right now but if you pack it on
you can see more of the blue in there
it's not swatching great right now I
think it might just be because of my
awkward angle and all that I don't know
but usually like when you see it on my
finger that's what it looks like on the
eye like that if you pat it on so all
right let me get my towel so I stop it
gets such a mess all over myself and I'm
attached so I can't go very far I'm
attached I'm attached alright try to
clean up a little bit here if I have to
I'll get my Bioderma and clean up better
alright let's keep going let's keep
going Stevie's girl loves the comfort
zone palette me too me too
hi Julie and
nicole says wet-and-wild is one of her
favorite drugstore paths yes agreed and
Ramon Schick says comfort zone is a
staple everyone should get it's a great
palette I totally agree I mean it's
definitely not like I wish that there
was a matte nude shade not nude but a
matte like champagne II lighter color
for brow bone in here but you can't have
everything you know okay so next is the
l'oreal la palette nude one I was
keeping this but I never reach for this
thing it's not a bad palette it's pretty
good I like it as much as well I don't
know if I like as much as the comfort
zone but it's pretty good it's pretty
good it's not terrible it's pretty good
you can get some pretty looks out of it
the lasting power on this isn't great
but it's a good palette I'm gonna go and
pass it on I'm gonna pass it on I kept
it last time I decluttered but passing
it on now all right mad format this is
the elf mad format I think I am going to
keep this because I do really like this
palette a lot it's very high quality for
especially for elf it's really good it's
a $10 palette it's very nice and lasting
power is probably about the same as the
lapel a nude one I don't know maybe I
should keep it now I'm having second
thoughts and thinking about it's good
for like comparison purposes and things
like that I think I'm going to keep the
lip out a nude one since it's still
around if that ever goes out of
production I'll declutter it and same
thing with this I think I'm going to
keep it but if they ever stopped being
made I'll probably get rid of them
Maggie says the thing too L'Oreal is a
bit pricey I agree and the thing about
the thing about drugstore palettes is
they've really raised the price on them
so if you
I honestly don't recommend a lot of
drugstore palettes like the wet and wild
I feel like those are six bucks and you
can get great looks out of them when we
start getting into like the 15 $20 range
for a drugstore eyeshadow palette it
better be pretty darn close to high-end
quality you know what I mean because you
might as well spend an extra $10 or $20
and get something amazing I mean because
eyeshadow palettes last forever and if
you're going to invest you know I feel
like it's better to just save up and get
that one palette that your Holy Grail
that's your amazingness rather than
getting you know two or three drugstore
palettes that are just okay you know
Frick's is for the price of two or three
drugstore pouch you can get a high-end
eyeshadow palette
like really nice you know Katy Garvin
says I think the elf mad format is a lot
better than the Loreal one it's been a
while since I've used it to be
completely honest and I I remember them
both being pretty good that's that's
what my memory is telling me is that
they're both pretty good but it's been a
while because like I said there's very
rarely Oh see we got Emily agreeing with
Katie the I think was I'm getting lost I
think it was Katie hit it said that a
second ago let me just verify that that
I was talking with Katie a second ago
yes I just want to get it wrong Oh
Kathryn says we donate cuz you are an
amazing person and you were so kind and
down-to-earth and honest Thank You
Kathryn Kathryn downing I appreciate you
Katherine's got a YouTube channel as
well if you wanted to check it out ka th
e ry n downing Kathryn downing um yeah I
mean like I was saying I have very
little time outside of when I'm testing
new palates to pick something that I
want to use that's just for fun that's
just for me like today I just picked
this dose of colors but I'm still I'm
testing the dose of colors because it's
brand new and I want to know whether
it's good or not so it's like rare that
I have a choice and I probably won't be
reaching for the Loreal or the elf to be
completely honest because there's other
palettes that I like more and it doesn't
necessarily have to do with the price it
just has to do with the fun I have using
the palette and these are not super fun
you know I mean so I don't know um
Victoria says I'm finally up and get to
watch I'm so happy I love these this
Thanks thanks for being the best oh
you're welcome Victoria I'm so glad that
you're here Kat Von D this is the not
the monarch the it doesn't I don't even
think it says it on it hold on a minute
it's not the monarch the chrysalis
palette it says a metamorphosis of color
I'm pretty sure this is the chrysalis
palette though is another one that I
don't reach for very often it's just the
color selection confuses me a bit I
don't really wear these colors a whole
lot I don't really know
general wants to know if I have the Jota
palette I don't have the hooded palette
I heard bad things about it from like in
shawnee at total makeup junkie 101 and a
couple other reviews so I kind of passed
on it I'm not really going to cry about
it
if it ever came back I might consider
buying it but it's really hard to get
and when palates are really hard to get
did I just put makeup on my lip I hope
not
and when palettes are really hard to get
it's almost like there's no point
reviewing them because they're so hard
to do it hard to keep just happy says
have to keep Kat Von D I think I am
going to keep it I mean this silver
shade look at this and this motions just
happy things I need to keep it look at
that what is that what is that even from
this planet saving says would you ever
go cruelty free I try to buy a lot of
cruelty free but because a lot of my
audience is not cruelty free I don't go
completely cruelty free but I do try to
be conscious of it and I do make sure
that I announce at the beginning of the
video whether something is cruelty free
or not I think if I stopped making
youtube videos I think I would go
cruelty free alright so this is the
Urban Decay Naked basics palette these
are amazing I really like the naked
basics - better than the naked basics
one because these shades are really not
that different from each other but these
are staples in my collection I
absolutely love these so much misstep
says that Silverson stay insane I need
to keep that right Catherine says Jen
I'll be filming my first video in like a
week I've been sick with a sinus
infection really knocked me out I hope
you feel better oh I hate those those
are the worst I mean you're not the
worst but those are those are not fun so
anyway so this is a really great palette
if you're looking for something that you
just want to pull be able to have
something to pull in for your basic
shades for your brow bone for your
crease for your maybe for like a base
down for your lid these naked palettes
these basics are amazing and I'm pretty
sure they're on sale right now somewhere
I feel like they're on sale the Urban
Decay is it Urban Decay website or Ulta
somewhere I feel like they're on sale
but I can't think of where right now I
hate that I even said that because I
can't remember exactly where but I feel
like I heard that these are on sale or I
dreamed it I don't know
I dream about makeup it's great I all
right um mama Shauna says I see you
wearing a shirt on Oh Oh miss Chris says
has anyone had the ultimate basics it's
$39 today on Ulta I did not buy that I
passed on it but I've heard really good
things about it is it all - everybody's
telling me it's Ulta Jamie says these
here Heidi from V dreamcatcher mama
Lizzy loves laissez Ulta so check out
Ulta if you want the naked basics
because these are definitely something
that I have used so many times with
other palettes especially things like
the Tarte make believe in yourself
palette where you can't make a complete
look out of it you need other shadows to
help you so this these are perfect to
pair with that
Tatiana says I don't know you well but I
feel like I know you well enough to want
to see your face weekly oh that yeah
Mimi says I do not own Urban Decay
palette if these call to you I would
definitely recommend these because
they're they're so easy to pull into
other palettes and they can really
brighten up with you if you have to feel
like a national drug store because
high-end palettes can speed terrible -
but if you have like a drugstore palette
or a high-end palette that's under
performing this can kind of perk it up a
little bit and give you a little bit
more umph to it you know what I mean
dubs one says yeah I made it they've
been so long love you so much in all
thank you Sarah loves the Naked basics -
awesome
all right this is the weekend warrior by
Amanda Steele I feel like I already
talked about this palette and it just
snuck back in here I don't know but
anyway this shade is not good it makes
my entire I look fade away to
nothingness but these three shades are
really good let me see if they have the
names of it excuse me the names of the
shades on here they don't well that's a
bummer I wish that they printed the
names of the shades on the balm you'd
think they would but anyway I guess if
you look it up you can find out but this
one I did not like the quality of it but
the rest of the matte ones here were
really good this is a shimmery shade and
the restaurant matte I was going to do a
full review on this and I'd really like
to but I just can't I keep buying new
things like yesterday I bought the
the new Sephora give me some new lip kit
and I bought the one of the pretty
vulgar palates that brought them I
bought the bright one keeps like I'm
wiping like makeup on my face because
I'm sweating hmm what t-shirt is it's my
crybaby job my crybaby Johnny Depp shirt
is what I'm wearing today
Zumba doll what do you think that
whoever palette Ruby asked I have gotten
so many questions about zoeva palette
and I have not bought any I know nothing
about zoeva I haven't tried anything but
I've gotten more requests for zou ever
recently than I have of any other brand
so yes I need to try some I need to try
some this is the Atelier Paris they are
a perfume cologne company and they have
some makeup now I got this in my beauty
list lucky bag and I don't think I've
even used it once i think i swatched it
and I don't think I've used it once I do
want to use it because opposed idli it's
amazing and it's great color range
you've got a nice range of light medium
and deep so I need to use this I'm going
to keep it I need to use it I'm feeling
eventually it's going to be passed along
oh my goodness two people activated a
super chat thank you so much Yesenia my
girl says briefly have you been affected
by the YouTube ad turmoil would you
consider a patreon account so we who
love your content want to support you I
have not been affected monetarily from
the YouTube ad turmoil I've seen a lot
of channels being affected my channels
have not been D monetized and I haven't
noticed a significant drop in my ad
revenue so at this point I would not do
a patreon and I probably will never do a
patreon because I don't feel like I
don't know it'd be something that I
would think about but patreon I think
takes it to a new level beyond the super
chat I don't know I don't know I feel
weird about a patreon I support to
people on patreon right now that are
youtubers one of my ask some artists
that I he does it full-time I support
him and I support Kendall Rey um who has
yeah Kendall Reyes her YouTube name
those are the two that I personally
support sorry about that I hit the
microphone those are the two that I
support on patreon I don't know if I
would do one Paula thank you so much for
the donation I
really appreciate again entering it into
the spreadsheet I really appreciate it
but I don't feel like I'm in a financial
situation where I need to do a patreon
if I ever got in a situation where I did
need it then maybe but right now I don't
I'm good but thank you so much yes Anya
I really appreciate that that's really
nice of you
patreon is a place where you can donate
to a channel every single month so it
like builds you monthly so for example
for for Tony and for Kendall I'm build
five dollars a month to support their
channel so they're both doing it
full-time and they're both having
trouble maintaining their channel
without getting an additional job so and
I love their content enough and they
post so frequently I know their content
would go down if I didn't if they didn't
get the support they needed so I want
them to continue making videos so it's
four and plus it's almost like I'm
paying five dollars a month for videos
that I truly enjoy you know so you know
and I'm open to other people too to
supporting other people too I just
haven't found anybody else that I feel
like I need I had that heart to support
you know what I mean I feel like I
missed a super chat somewhere Oh Rose
rose I missed you I almost missed it I
almost miss your comment Rose says I
know this is turning into a super chat
conversation I apologize if you're
watching this on the replay I'm really
sorry Rose says your Sunday chats are
staple of my week your collective brain
and wrench wrench wrench wenches are the
best and nicest folks on YouTube the
wrench Lynch is itself self proclaimed
or my my moderators on the chat oh
that's so nice of you Rose I love seeing
you every week in chat thank you so much
let's see Jenna says pretty vulgar since
talk it's a four yes and I got the
bright one because the other two weren't
really calling to me and really the
bright one wasn't calling to me either
but I wanted something different so
that's why I got that one all right back
to decluttering I'm really sorry I went
off topic for so long I know people are
going to hate on me for that I'm really
sorry I can't go back
all right revealed palette 20 eyeshadow
colors the original reveal palette I
think I'm going to keep because it's the
Coastal Scents revealed palette it's a
it's a it's a staple dupe palette I do
have a complete review
of the reveal palette the original
comparing it to the naked 2 palette
there also some shades in here that are
similar to the original Naked palette
I know Coastal Scents is coming out with
a new palette they are sending me one
for pre-release and it's like a more
like a I forget what they said in the
email it's like a more like a flowery
kind of colors and things like that but
I will show you that I will be doing a
full review of that and there will be a
giveaway in that video because they
always give me $100 gift card for a
Coastal Scents that I'm not going to be
using so that will be giveaway so make
sure that you are watching that the
revealed palettes Emily are very good
quality for the price I feel like the
revealed smokey palette is just as good
a quality as the Urban Decay smoky
palette I feel like this one is close to
the as good a quality as the Urban Decay
not quite but close enough where I think
a lot of people wouldn't notice the
difference between this and Urban Decay
the packaging of course is much cheaper
looking but there's I mean it's a really
good palette though revealed 3 was my
least favorite I did not enjoy the
reveal 3 at all but the revealed the
revealed 2 and the revealed smokey were
all very very good all right back to
velvet 59 this is the rose metals
palette and I'm mmm
there's a couple of shades in here I
really really like a lot I really like
this shade this is the shokudo shade I
did do a full review on these as well
I really like passion flower I really
like Persian pink I don't know if I'm
going to reach for this though I don't
know if this is something I'm going to
reach for the shade selection is very
odd and that you've got some warms and
some cools and I'm it's hard to pair
orange and purple and get a really nice
look out of it you know what I mean like
I don't know why I just have trouble
with the shade selection in this but I
do really like some of the shades and
I'm going to keep this one
I'm going to keep this one because it is
a really nice palette you're very
welcome Emily I think I saw Natalie in
here somewhere I wanted to say something
to Natalie
Emily says home when gee I can't wait
for V dreamcatchers new video she's so
awesome she is amazing isn't she I
featured her in my video of youtubers
under 20,000 subscribers she's got more
than 20,000 now that you need to watch V
dream
catcher one thing I appreciate about her
I know I'm going off topic again it
happens her Instagram pictures its VII
dream catcher her Instagram pictures are
not retouched in my opinion they do not
look like they have been face tuned and
they're insanely gorgeous like I don't
know how she does that how she makes
them look like because you can see all
of her skin texture but the eye shadow
look is so perfectly blended but you can
see all of her skin texture it's like
what how does she even do that it's like
she's a magical makeup fairy I don't
know how she does it it's amazing I did
see I saw something from Natalie there
she is forgive me if you already
mentioned but ulties a big naked basics
palette on sale for $39 right now just
got the email Thank You Natalie I
appreciate that so much Natalie's
channel is the thinking blonde alright
love back V okay so this is the Too
Faced natural at night palette and this
is one that I want to reach for and
never do and I think part of the reason
why I never reach for it is the glitter
fallout from this palette these this
shade here and this shade here have so
much glitter fallout and I feel like for
me and my skin tone I need those shades
in order to give me some some depth to
my look that these are my nice lids and
it's like they they just it kind of
falls apart because the glitter just
goes everywhere you know yeah he says
nah girl I don't have time for facetune
you're making me blush I can't believe
you don't use it oh my gosh it's amazing
you're amazing so I think I'm going to
pass this on with with pain and my heart
because I do really love these shades
but again I don't reach for it and it's
got the glitter issue that I don't like
so I'm going to go ahead and pass that
along by the way if you've never been to
the declares before it when I say pass
along I'm going to give the option to my
Facebook admins and my whatsapp and
makeup reporters they're going to get
first dibs at everything and then a lot
of it is probably going to get donated
to the what is it the one that that
Taylor does the shelter where they take
not shelter but it's like a program that
gives makeup to people that don't have
makeup and
yes it's like I think they don't have
makeup that is a horrible explanation
but it's like it's a charity donation I
think it's for homeless women I'm pretty
sure it's been a while since I've looked
at it and then I just found out about
one that it gives the give makeup to
women who are trans who are or
transitioning to wearing makeup so I was
thinking of donating some to them as
well because that sounded amazing but I
need to look into that all right cargo
this is the warm neutral palette this is
an amazing travel palette I really love
this palette this is kind of like Naked
basics before Naked basics came out it
is wonderful this brown has a little bit
of shimmer in it and then the lid shade
here has a little bit of shimmer in it
and these two are matte it's super easy
like go-to I can get my eyeshadow done
in a second and it looks like a nice
wearable work project Beauty share thank
you so much for that I really appreciate
all the people that are putting that in
there tiffany has a new puppy that's so
cool
so anyway so this is wonderful Chris
thank you so much it says you're the
only second youtuber I've donated to
really love the feeling feel the love
you half your fan and you know what's
funny I will never call people fans
never it like makes me feel like weird
but that but the community yes
absolutely thank you so much you're
allowed to say it but I I don't like to
say that word about cuz fan just sounds
very lot to Mary but thank you so much
Chris you can say I just feel weird that
was really nice of you thank you but I
do have lots of love and the thing is is
a lot of people that watch my videos I
know I'm off topic again it happens
sorry I'm really sorry a lot of people
I've been on YouTube on with this
channel for five years five years five
years four years five years on all lost
track but some people have been with me
forever I know them you know and I've
got my Facebook community I talk to
people all the time I talk to people on
Twitter all the time so I like know
people I feel like I you know Annalise's
I'm a super fan LMAO it's anyway cargo
for the most part I want to make sure
you know this I don't like most of their
eyeshadows like the palettes that I've
gotten from them
I have not enjoyed at all but I really
like this one I really like this one I
don't know what happened this is an
older palette I wish they had I wish
they had a dates on the back like
release dates on the back kind of like
they do on books like copyright dates
that would be amazing but this one is
really good but the other ones are just
kind of bull the ones I've tried alright
we're getting to the bottom of the bag
here got another one of these lorac
indulge in white chocolate I never reach
for this this is going to be passed
along and yep nope
okay this is oh this I'm returning why
haven't I returned the ship I got this
from Sephora I love that Sephora let you
return things for like ever this is the
smoky palette I did a full review on
this it was it was really difficult to
work with in that all of these shades
fade to black for the most part they
just fade to black they fade to nothing
and it's really difficult to work with I
don't like it it just it bothers me so
this is actually getting returned I saw
the packaging I saw the receipt I need
to return it the elfin unit nude palette
I like this one better than the mad
format it's very very nice this one I
definitely recommend you pick up if
these shades call to you I like it
again I like it better than that format
but I know some people really love their
matte shades so if you really love your
matte shades get the mad format but if
you like the shimmers definitely this
one is fabulous tabatha thank you so
much for posting the group the Facebook
group link there I appreciate it so much
ty says Smashbox shadows are bula -
greed sigh oh my goodness there's only
one more pallet left in here that's it
this is the urban decay
I want to say it doesn't have the name
on it this is I forget what this one was
called but they released it in a few
different versions I don't know why I
bought it I never use it and the glitter
in here is insane the fallout is insane
I don't really like it Steph says that
palette wants to be Metallica this is
just the glitter the glitter just kills
me the glitter kills me I'm not I'm
never going to use that cuz the glitter
is just insane I don't even know if
anybody would want that now it's
probably going to end up getting passed
to beyond the people that I immediately
know because I don't I don't know if any
of them will want that so I shadow
palettes are done we're done we're done
so let me show you what I'm getting rid
of alright so these are the eye shadow
palettes from this declutter that I am
passing on a Maggie says OMG i love that
shadow box okay

about decluttering makeup brushes

Sonia that's really smart that's why I
need you Sonia in my life it's a good
idea I think I'm going to do that and
thank you for the super chat you said
yeah this is actually a really good
highly pigmented blush it's got a little
cat in there that's pretty much worn
away because I've used it but it's so
pigmented that it's kind of hard to use
so I'm going to go ahead and pass it
along
Makita says Gen Ewell really the first
youtuber I feel like putting your all
into your videos we all love you thank
you so much I do I put my heart and soul
into it just like I've done everything
every job I've ever had
I really do put everything I can into my
videos alright the city color be matte
blush I'm going to keep this I really
like this one a lot it's very pigmented
but it's in fresh melon but it's not so
pigmented that it's really hard to work
with it's a little hard to work with but
I really like the shade a lot so I'm
going to keep that one this one just got
sent to me by benefit and I actually
have the the new one downstairs a
California and I need to take a picture
for Instagram so it's like down there on
my desk like where I shot the other
video I'm still like trying to breathe
over some of these super chat donations
you guys are doing like I'm still trying
to breathe but I have to take a picture
but I do have gala for Nia downstairs I
haven't swatched it yet or anything that
benefits sent me which is really really
nice of them to send me
but yeah so dandelion I was surprised
how much I liked this because I heard it
was extremely sheer but it's really not
at least on my skin tone it's not I can
see where this would not work for
everybody you see it looks so sheer in
the swatch but I really like it
it's
looks beautiful for a nice light wash of
color Steph says honestly you're the
only youtuber I support a hundred
percent because I established your
genuine spirit I established our genuine
spirit early which I appreciate thank
you stuff and I am going to do my best
to never let you down
I am I really like your faith in me
means so much to me like you have no
idea you have no idea okay
laura geller ethereal rose this is a
fantastic blush laura geller makes
really nice cheek products they're
probably one of my favorite brands for
cheek products them in the bone laura
geller highlights the big gelato ones
the swirly ones are amazing and then
these here for blushes are wonderful I
think it's one of the most underrated
brand on YouTube for cheek products some
of the other products are kind of burnt
but this is oh this is a bronzer I
believe no it's not this how long it's
been since I opened it this is less
Cabos by cargo they make really nice
blushes that are very very long-lasting
so I really like that
tabatha thanks for looking out okay so
let's get into okay this is a baby
coralista and I feel like I have
coralista in a blush palette I don't
think I need this and I think it's
really old I'm going to trash this
because this is really really old it's a
sample size and I'm pretty sure I have
this in a blush palette so I don't think
I need this anymore so I'm going to get
rid of that one
this is extremely old and it's a cream
product so this one is definitely going
to have to be tracked this is the Stila
convertible color in peony I got this a
really long time ago and I liked it
it is very natural-looking blend it into
the skin very nicely doesn't smell too
terrible but I know this is probably
four years old so I'm going to get rid
of that one alright this is this is the
NARS virtual domination chic palette and
I did buy this
okay so the shades in here there's
Laguna
there's final cut sex fantasy deep
throat and miss Liberty I'm going to
keep this just because it has some NARS
staples in it like Laguna and I got rid
of all my smaller Laguna's because I had
it in this palette but I always forget
to use this Laguna I always forget that
it exists so I need to make sure that I
use that more okay this was gifted to me
by the woman that did the unique
sponsorship not sponsorship it was not a
sponsor video I don't know why I just
said because it's not even sponsored she
sent me the unique products she sent me
this as well this is the skin frost and
Regina George and I hate to say it I did
not purchase it I hate to say it but
this is a really good blush it's very
neon pink so you have to really want to
dig that neon pink the pan is stupidly
huge I don't know why the pan is so big
I I guess it's just because Gabrielle
says you just say deep throat totally
did
totally did it's the name of the past
the name of the blush I got to say it
right this um sarah says yeah I'm not
into blush yeah some people are some be
born I understand I'll fail you but this
is a really good high quality product I
have to say it is I'm not if you know me
you know I'm not a big fan of him as a
person the way he presents himself
publicly I'm not a big fan I don't know
him personally but I'm definitely going
to keep this because I'm really enjoying
it I have to say I'm really enjoying its
neon pink it's neon pink but it actually
blends into the skin pretty nicely and
let me swatch it for you I know some of
you were like me where you you don't do
that but don't support the Jeffrey star
but it actually it doesn't look like it
blends into the skin very nicely from
that but it does I promise you it does
it's very nice okay I just happy says
make up break up broke up as
highlighters and there's tons of product
and you're I'm sure there is okay this
is a Tarte blush a mini one an eternal
this is a beautiful shade I'm keeping
that there are minerals pop of passion I
hadn't used this very much I got it I
forget where I got this
in like a bareMinerals mystery box or
something like that but I remember
really likeness I think I'm only use it
once though so I need to use it more
forget where I got this I can't remember
but I do like it this is one that I'm
going to pass along because I do have
other shades they're exactly the same
this is a Korean beauty products
Zini Zhu I think xin y i z hu i i
apologize if i butchered that it's a
really great product though it's really
really good i think i got an a' me me
box a while back but it's very very nice
very nicely pigmented build a bowl it's
beautiful but I mean it's almost the
exact same shade as this cargo one it's
a little deeper than that one but let's
see so this is the pure cheek stain and
Cabernet
it smells like like cranberries and
that's full strength and then you blend
it out and it's beautiful it's a
gorgeous shade I'm definitely keeping
that even if for nothing else in it
smells like cranberries Jekyll says I
made it probably last second haha
welcome Jacquelyn Ruby says I feel like
the only one that isn't into the
highlight trend I think that you know I
feel like people with the highlight
trend I feel like a lot of people that
have oily skin don't get the highlight
trend because they've spent so much time
trying to combat the shininess it's like
why are you creating the shine what I
don't get this I don't know if you feel
like that but I heard that from people
this is a makeup revolution the matte
powder blush and divine is a fantastic
blush if you want a good drugstore blush
these are really really good lasting
power isn't as good on these for me as
some other blushes but it's still really
really good and still good also get you
through a work or school day but it'll
probably gone by the end like tail end
of the work or school day
I've got a few color pops here that I
never reach for but I need to reach for
them more i've got between the sheets
and I've got holiday I do like the color
pop blushes the super shock cheek cheek
ones because I feel like they're easier
to use than the ones that are the
eyeshadows I feel like the eyeshadows I
have trouble getting them where I want
them to go but I need to use them with a
sponge tip applicator and see if that
helps for the eyeshadows but I really
like the cheek products if I can just
pop them on my cheeks with my fingertips
and blend them in and it works out well
or I can use a stippling brush
like that Katie says yes I such Olli
skin and don't use highlighter unless
I'm doing an Instagram look lol I love a
matte look yes this is a beautiful blush
I don't know if they still make this
this is the NYX blush and natural and
that's exactly what it is it's a very
natural-looking blush of course it's
very light so it's not going to work for
everybody but I really like this for
like natural days this is my Christmas
blush my Christmas blush this is called
cinnamon by NYX and I really like this
too but you can tell these are old
because I mean I think they make this
format anymore but they might still make
the shades I don't know but I really
love that one I only wear to Christmas
time now these are super shock shadows I
don't know why they're in my blush
drawer I've got Sam swoon and in a
pickle and I don't know why they're my
blush drawer they're in the wrong thing
those are eyeshadows let's put them back
in the auto shows let's do that this is
a laura geller baked swirl baked gelato
Vivid swirl and papaya and I love these
these are such good quality lasting
power is fantastic really really love
them a lot may do a little swatch of
this one don't have any space here we'll
put it right there right um but it
blends so nicely I don't know if you can
see how that blends but blends out
really nicely because pigmentation isn't
necessarily a great thing in a blush you
want it to be able to blend out you want
it to be able to build up this is Kiko
Milano this is the soft touch blush and
this is something I haven't used a whole
lot but I really like this a lot I
really like this weight v just said
something important she says NYX has
different packaging now formula isn't as
good anymore in my opinion oh no that
makes me so sad why do they do that why
why
kara says Christmas blush what yes it's
what I always wear at Christmas time I
always wear red blush at Christmas time
it's like a thing I don't know I do it's
like I've gotten used to it fast like
for years since I've owned that blush I
wear it every Christmas I don't know
what's applying Stef says sponges can
work well for color pop or a good stiff
synthetic brush nice great stuff good to
know thank you I've tried very little
Kiko Milano I did really like this blush
lasting power again was just okay for me
but it is a beautiful color i really
like it i love these shades these shades
make me so happy
okay moving on this is the beauty
real this is a dual ended creamy thingy
it's got a highlight on one side and a
blush on the other side I haven't used
this a whole lot hmm the cream product I
could chop off the top and pass it along
because I might actually going to reach
for this I'm probably not actually going
to reach for this but it is nice I'll
probably just trim off the tops and pass
that along
Tarte blushing bride this is when I was
using a lot for a long time I really
like this it's kind of a mess I could
chop off the top and pass it along
because I honestly I don't reach for it
very much so I'm going to pass that
along little bit muzu Road okay this is
another one that I am going to pass
along this is a sample of the Sephora
blush in peony it's just kind of a pain
in the butt to work with to blend it out
it's just the formula of it is just kind
of a pain it's annoying to get it to
exactly where I want to go but it's not
a bad product it's just annoying so I
don't I don't reach for it this is my
favorite cheek tint and it's strange
because it's a brand that I don't know
much about and I don't use very much
from the brand this is Elizabeth moths
not Elizabeth moths tints and sass
Tiffany wants to know what's on my nails
KL polishes that's what she said and I
put on yesterday and it's already
chipping I put it on like middle of the
day yesterday it's already chipping it's
my big complaint about the tail polishes
they chip pretty quickly but they're
beautiful to go on anyway this is my
favorite cheek stain it's probably the
only one I enjoy using because it
doesn't dry so fast that you can't blend
it out and the lasting power is
wonderful the tone is wonderful so I'm
going to keep that one these right here
I have cha-cha tints I have a little
cha-cha tint and a big chocolate it
because benefit sent me a big one so I'm
going to pass along the little one you
know what I'm not I'm going to pass
along the big one because I don't am I
going to use it I'm going to use all
this no I'm not going to use it I'm
going to use this much so I'm going to
pass the big one along it's beautiful it
is more of a cheek stain and it's orange
but it doesn't look like this on the
skin as much when you blend it out you
see how it's not as bright
it just gives that like Coralie kind of
glow to the skin when
blend it out he says Elizabeth Mott
thank you thank me later I shadow
primers amazing oh good to know
I will be thanking you later all right
we're almost out of time let's get
through this drawer I also have posy
tint which I haven't really used much
this one's like a neon pink to go on and
then you blend it out and it becomes
very very natural beautiful journey says
Jen you need a thick top coat try Seche
vite and that is my next step because I
have been purposely not using a top coat
because I wanted to see how they perform
without a top coat because everyone a
lot of people use different top coats
and I didn't want my top coat which is
the sesh feet to influence the wear time
so after I'm done I'm going to take this
one off today because it's already
chipping and put on the last one which
is the cotton one cotton I don't know
the whitish one I'm gonna put that one
on and then once I'm done with that I'm
going to try some of them with a top
coat and see if that helps but thank you
so much it's good to know that that
helps Essman says I can't get behind
those tints they provide a very natural
flush of color now some blush can kind
of sit on top of the skin cheek tints
can kind of go into the skin I know I
said that this is my favorite this is
the only one that I use but these are
ones that I'm more trying they're not
ones that are like once I reach for and
like yes I have to use posy tint today
but the ones that I want to have a good
knowledge in my head about so that's why
I'm keeping those alright I've got a few
of these these are juleps to different
packaging this is the new packaging this
is the old packaging so I've got this is
golden guava and I've got sheer glow and
I've got Desert Rose and I've got
passion fruit I do have a subscription
to julep so I get I get these a lot in
my subscription so these are really
really long wearing they're very nice
cream products I really enjoy them this
is a highlighter this goes and this goes
on my highlighter drawer I need to put
that in there
so this one is the golden guava and this
one is the passion fruit this is the one
I reach for the most because you know I
like that kind of shade and then this
one is Desert Rose but I really like
this one too they're all beautiful and
the lasting powers fantastic I think
julep is a very underrated makeup brand
and I've got one more thing in here so
I'm going to keep that one more thing in
here this is
a little sample of the arrow revive
cooling cheek tint and this just got
lost
I haven't hardly used it let's look and
see what's inside because I have no idea
it got lost Oh looks like that oh the
glistening glow Azra says use the
glistening glow H I haven't tried the
glisten and glow I remember hearing
about that first on young wild and
polish channel that's what that looks
like blended out I'm going to have to
try that
so yeah julep is very underrated as far
as makeup products so let me go ahead
and restock this up and I'll show you
and then we're going to get going for
the day because it's done for today and
yeah I have to go because my daughter
we're celebrating another Wiccan holiday
today if you don't know my daughter is
Wiccan she decided that when she was six
and we celebrate all the holidays today
is Beltane so we are going to make a
flour custard we bought some edible
flowers we bought some marigolds and
some other flowers we're going to put
into the custard vanilla oven at real
vanilla bean and some different things
so I'm really excited to celebrate that
with her she's been talking about it for
a month so look I'm going to put this
together and I'll show you what we have
and then maybe we'll do because we do
have makeup brushes so maybe we'll do
the rest of the blushes and makeup
brushes next week this definitely
doesn't look as pretty as it did when I
first showed it to you because there's
things missing I'm going to have to
rearrange once we finish decluttering I
may just end up with one tray which
would be kind of cool and that way I
really end up using the products that I
use all the time so this is what's left
of that tray this is what's left over
here to declutter we haven't decluttered
that yet and then let me gather up the
things I'm passing along not too many
not too many so these are the ones that
I'm passing along and then there's the
one little baby coralista that I'm
throwing in the trash because it's old
and I don't need it a little so let me
put these do I have a box here I have
like decluttering boxes like all over
the place of the decluttered products
and I'm going to post pictures for my
that helped me I'm going to post
pictures and stuff I'll include you in
that too
I'll have to make sure there's a way to
get stuff involved sand stuff is always
here helping with the admin stuff oh and
then these how did would happen with
these oh but these need to go and
different um forgot about this that need
to go in there and these need to go in
different drawers they were in the wrong
place
alright so anything else we need to talk
about before we go Maggie says that's
great when kids like religions daughter
begs us to go to church and gets excited
when my health when when my health lets
me oh yeah I feel like it's important
for kids to explore different religions
and become their own people and that's
just my personal parenting style I have
no I don't knock anybody for their
parenting style everyone has a right to
raise their children any way they want
that's just the way that I choose to
raise my child is to let her explore it
and try different things so anyway
Oh Steph plea if you change your mind
let me know because if there's anything
that you know if you want to get in on
it let me know alright so I'm going to
go ahead and say goodbye for today and I
want to thank you so much for being here
thank you for for participating in the
declutter if you were here live if you
watch this and you're all the way at the
ends thank you so much for putting up
with all of my side chatter because I
did side chatter a lot today and I can't
help it it's me I'm not going to I can't
change who I am I can't I can't do it I
can't do it so but anyway maybe I'll do
a full makeup collection as a video when
we're done so that people that want to
see it without all the chatter can see
it maybe I'll do that and then that way
people make those people be happy maybe
I think my biggest eternal flaw is
trying to make everybody happy when I
know that that's not possible you know
oh well so I want to thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it we
will see you next week I believe I don't
think I can't think of any reason why we
