the makeup chat it's so good to have you
here
I am excited about chat and I'll tell
you why I'm excited about chat I'm
excited about chat because we are
finishing the decluttering series today
after today it will be done we've been
decluttering since I think mid-february
and now it is mid-may ish meant well
early May you know but we don't
decluttering for a while we had lots of
stuff to go through
so uh we're gonna finish today we're
going to do blushes and then we're going
to go into my brush collection and I
have a stupid amount of brushes so let
me show you but before I say hello to
the collective brain these are the
blushes I think we already talked about
the jeffree star one but because it was
so prominently in the thumbnail I
decided I was going to talk about it
again and then I also have these because
I just film by the balm brand review
it's fun so it's a collaboration so it
just depends on when Terry's ready to
post I'm still not done editing it it's
a monster of a video there's so much
information in there it needs a lot of
work still but anyway I have these
insane blushes from the balm is what
we're going to be talking about and let
me show you my brushes I didn't realize
how many brushes I had until I tried to
put them together for this video oh my
gosh I just realized there's more I
forgot one of the little case things oh
my gosh let me get it hold on I just
realized I didn't empty this thing out
there's more of them not that many more
until I mean this is this is stupid this
is stupid I mean it's one thing to have
multiples of different brushes and
things you know for you know because you
don't eat one gets dirty you want to
have a backup and all that but this is
stupid they put these in here see if I
can even squeeze these in between
I don't even usually use this thing for
brushes they were just in all kinds of
little containers and different fillings
okay so I have this and I have this and
I have this so it's kind of stupid so
let's go ahead and flip through them and
mangle decide you know do I really need
them are
a lot of the ones they're going to be
gone are going to be the ones that I
just don't find any functional brushes
for me and pass them along someone else
who may find them to be more functional
but before we do I am going to go ahead
and say hello to the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness and I am going to put
my disclaimer in and then I am NOT going
to apologize anymore if you don't like
chat format meaning I'm going to be
talking to people that I've invited into
my home if you don't let me going
off-topic and doing that then this video
may not be for you and I'm really really
sorry if you don't enjoy this format but
this is the way I chose to do this and I
do live chats every Sunday and this is
what I do and I'm sorry if you don't
like it there's tons more content on the
channel if you don't enjoy this format
but I am going to be going on top again
and they'll be talking to people which
you can't say so
I like their import and I like them as
people so we're going to talk to him
speaking of that we're going to go ahead
and say hello to them and hopefully
everything has been working this whole
time but usually check to make sure okay
so the morning to Elijah and Lisa and
Amanda coffee was still brewing Licata
was Tina why do I always do that you
told me tell you can call you latina
should she try to do in the Facebook
group so you want to know how long the
wait is to join me what's up and make up
Facebook group image search for what
type of makeup you should find it it's
got about 22,000 members twenty-two
thousand seven hundred members somewhere
in there so if you find that one that's
a Facebook group it can take anywhere
from a few minutes to a week it just
depends on how many of the admins are
working on the queue and I haven't been
helping lately so that has slowed things
down some but because the admins are so
amazing they've been letting people in I
think there's only about 25 people
waiting so if you did put your name in
and you didn't put it in today you put
it in another day you should already be
in if you're not you may have been
denied because your account is private
and you didn't look like a legit person
who were denied if you get denied for a
Facebook group send me a private message
at Jen W you I am on Facebook that's my
name on Facebook I'm the only Jen WV
while you have it stands for lots of
good makeup so just send me a private
message and let me know what your name
is and then apply and I will personally
let you in so um but yeah so that's the
deal with the face
so hopefully you're in now latina Amanda
good morning to you she said it took her
about a day to give you the face book
that's pretty typical a date of three
days is pretty typical good morning to
Stephanie and Katherine Katherine says
good morning making my breakfast and
coffee getting ready for Chad how's
everybody today I'm good thank you
Alesana is here I'm glad you're here
autumn is here Karen is here AJ in the
house oh it just skipped down so if I
did not say good morning to you good
morning to you and welcome to the chat
Tammy says I love the Facebook group
it's so helpful when he says I love the
Facebook group I begin it it is pretty
stinking amazing I it blows me away
every day again I didn't even do it like
I didn't make the group I hope I was
really big in developing the rules and
things and kind of keeping everything
the tone the way that I wanted the tone
to be but really the community is the
people that are in the community the
people that are on the Facebook group
are the ones that make it let's say good
morning good morning everybody good
morning Michelle and Lacey she said she
had to reapply the Facebook group that
I'm there now and love it yeah it
happens sometimes good morning is Sonya
good morning Heather oh there you go
thank you Thank You Sonya okay so let's
go ahead and start with blushes I do
have a couple boxes I've got my makeup
geek box this is going to be for the
keepers and then for the pass along
we're going to put it in this random
boxes probably Samantha um yep no
Nordstrom it's from Nordstrom it opens
up you don't want the ones with the
faculties up but it is what it it okay
put our boxes do let's go through them
okay so first one is that Debbie who is
part of the big Debbie I'm pretty sure
it's Debbie I'm like 99% sure had
purchased this for me and sent this to
me after my social audio but this
actually isn't the one she purchased for
me the one she purchased for me was
broken so I ended up buying a new one
and I not buying what I traded it in for
me when they didn't have the shade that
she sent me unfortunately so this is
brand new I haven't even used it yet
this is in the shade nightfever it's the
Marc Jacobs blush which was
so nice of her to send that so
unfortunately I got broken but I'm
really excited to try this once this
one's definitely getting fat this is the
Mac Nutcracker sweet peach face compact
kind of have mixed feelings about this
thing it's I really like the highlight
the blush is kind of matte for me it's
really really lightly pigmented so it's
hard to show up on my skin doesn't show
it much but it's nice for a lighter
makeup day so I'm going to go ahead and
keep that one but it's you know and it's
pretty it's very pretty I'm Jeffrey
star-1 I think we talked about last week
I am going to keep this this was gifted
to me it's really good quality even
though I don't enjoy the man the way
that he presents himself in public I
don't know him personally but the way he
presents himself I do not like but mix
good makeup some people okay
these are ones that I found recently
okay this is the Bobbi Brown cheek
palette and I haven't used this much
either this is relatively new to me I
believe Nancy surfaced to me I'm 99%
sure Nancy sent this to me and I haven't
used it much it kind of got buried in my
I have like a drawer where I keep things
that are new that I need to try and it
kind of got buried in the bottom of that
drawer so now I'm going to put this in
the front so that I can use it but this
is the Bobbi Brown cheek palettes it
just it's golden light believes and
pretty pink or the name for the shades
but there's no like name on it but it's
very pretty
Elizabeth says Mac is very expensive in
New Zealand off her everything is
expensive in New Zealand as far as like
American products going there Aska says
that Geoffrey start blush will last you
a hundred years it's huge I know right
Cindy says good morning so many people
from all over I now live in Virginia
Virginia's not far from am in Maryland
g-g-gee says what's the facebook name I
want to join it's called what's up in
makeup you just do facebook.com slash
group slash what's been makeup Tiffany
says Jen I love that lip color on you
what is it it's the one the um you know
get it's the vice one from the lip it on
on hold on I'm getting it right here so
I have everything obstacle course here
to get through it's this one
liquid lipstick in the shade trivial and
so far I am loving this it's everything
I wanted the mega peak showstopper clubs
things to be of course you know urban
decay has a lot more longtime experience
making lip products so I and I don't if
you watch that video I felt awful that I
had to say I didn't like those felt
terrible about it but I have to tell you
the truth that's a tree but yeah but I
really like this formula totally kiss
proof very very comfortable I haven't
wanted all day yet though so I'm still
trying to figure out how it wears I'm
treating some comments little bit all
right next up back up this is a blush
palette this is blushed with light and
this has wisteria songbird and
Snapdragon I am going to keep this I do
really enjoy these shades NECA plushies
lasts pretty well on either highlighters
don't go for some reason which is very
odd the blushes I guess maybe the
pigmentation of them or whatever but the
highlighters don't um don't show up like
I just saw something that won't answer
lacy says Jen are you going to buy the
Judy's place blush pellets no but when I
was in IMAX the owner of doing this
place I'm pretty sure she's the owner of
dubious place she's high up in the
company but I'm pretty sure she's the
owner I don't to say that she said she's
going to send them to me so so sticking
excited about them I would have bought
them if she didn't already tell me she's
been ascendance me so hopefully I'll
have a review on the channel soon well
whenever she said them I haven't got him
yet
this one speaking of things being sent
to me this is was sent to me by the
benefit this is their new gala for Nia
blush I was planning on taking a picture
of this for Instagram so I haven't
touched it yet but uh it's so like in
the packaging and everything I haven't
touched it yet but the thing is probably
catching the California do we really
live in Our Lives I don't know I don't
think I need a picture of it so I'm just
going to swatch it for the first time
right now I'm scared that this isn't
over spray I'm very scared that that is
oh it is it just wiped off oh that's a
bummer look at that
it's gone
that's how it looks mmm
the golden overspray are you kidding me
I guess it would be hard to get that
that gold to sneak to be all the way in
there but that's a bummer
I'm gonna not swatch it anymore because
I don't want I want to put that gold on
my cheeks there's 100k so this right
here I'm not going to come I'm gonna get
rid of many of these watches be honest
but these are all like my go-to in here
this is the two-faced Papa don't peach
blush I want to let you know I did
return the blush palette the one with
the highlight and the blushes that one I
didn't feel like like was very pigmented
I didn't feel like I liked it I didn't
like using it it wasn't fun to use I
didn't enjoy it it was like I had to
scrape at it to get anything so I did
return that one but I am keeping the
blush itself in to do really like this
one a lot let me show you this one put
it next to them the gala for ya so this
is California I mean this is the pop
adult peach so Angela said the size of
Ben fluff just pisses me off how much is
in here what's in here I didn't even
look at that doesn't even say on your
odds and say on here yeah I don't know
doesn't say that's a bummer oh he it
says peel here one less I don't know
look and see if it doesn't move hold on
oh no we just got other languages that's
a bummer
don't say on here but anyway I have to
look that up and compare I don't know
but yeah I do really really like this
blush a lot in packaging super cute it
smells like peaches
I like the benefit I'm not gonna fit I
like the to face peach sense that's me
personally I know some people call it
sank a huge but I like it okay this
one's a really fun one this is an indie
brand this is called eldritch organics
eld RI d GE organics and this is called
autumn spice and it's a powder blush but
listen to the ingredients in this it's
got arrowroot starch beet root powder
and raw cacao
our and that's all that's in here
there's nothing else in here and when I
first got this I was like oh no and the
reason why I was like oh no was because
it is so pretty it is like straight grit
and I just realized when we put this top
back on and kind of level this out so it
doesn't make a huge mess it is so gritty
like it does it's not smooth because
it's all oh man it's still like that at
least if I can not make a mess here
you can see the shade hopefully he'll
fix I can't see myself right now and Ray
says keep your NARS blush as I will I
will
it's very gritty and it looks like it's
not pigmented but when you put it on the
cheats is actually quite beautiful
it's a very subtle kind of color and at
this the swatch when i swatched it first
i was like oh no when I put on my cheeks
it's actually very beautiful and I was
surprised it's very natural-looking
that's probably more like what's on my
finger there is more like what it looks
like but really really like this blush I
was shocked how much I liked it when I
felt it scared but it's very nice and
again this is for autumn spice and it's
by Eldridge organics it's an indie brand
I think I got it all fancy ok so now
we've got some tort blushes I've got
three of them in here I've decluttered
these a lot over the years because I
realized that a lot of them I just don't
use and I'd rather pass them on hi Steph
good morning I have ethnic I have
embellish and I have tipsy so this one
is called epic and I'm keeping all these
I'm probably not going to get rid of a
whole lot to be honest because I got rid
of more last troop this is embellish I
love these shades these kinds of shades
are my favorite these deep lines and
then this one is called tipsy I don't
really use this one that much but I'm
going to keep it because I don't have
another blush that's this colored on so
I'm going to keep it okay this is a
makeup geek blush and I really like
makeup blushes let me swatch this for
you there there salt
he's like the opposite of that Elvidge
organic way it's so incredibly salt I
love makeup geek they're on their blush
formula and hi like yes their highlight
formula and our shadow formula but this
one is incredibly soft pigmentation is
insane you just have to kind of be
careful with the clown face this is an
EXO EXO and the packaging is so cute
parent says she likes tipsy but yeah the
packaging it's got a magnetic closure
and just feels Lux you know it feels
fancy and it's not that expensive
considering the packaging is ridiculous
okay
this is Sephora colourful blush and
shame on you number one really like this
as well Sephora brand I really like to
do a brand review on Sephora if you
haven't um if you want to see a brand
review one Sephora Jackie I had just did
one and she have a really really good
job with it she bought with a thousand
dollars with the Sephora brand stuff if
you're looking for one right now but
shame on you number one really really
beautiful natural shade really like that
a lot actually says I'm late happy
Mother's Day happy Mother's Day to you
too
I actually have a Mother's Day
recommendations video coming out this
week so look forward to that that I'm
editing right now and then hopefully my
monthly favorites will be out this week
for April because I didn't I didn't I
didn't film it yet either I plan on
filming it the same day that I did the
Mother's Day one but I ran out of time
so I couldn't so I have to film it like
tomorrow or Tuesday alright Mary Kay
this is very old and it is a cream blush
we're gonna have to get rid of this but
I remember really really liking this a
lot and this is in sheer bliss and it's
a cream blush crushes are kind of hit
and miss for me I feel like some of them
are really beautiful and some of them
just don't last on me at all I find some
of them hard to blend I remember really
like this one this one's gonna have to
go in the trash because it's old and
gross kara said Jackie did a great job I
really like Jackie and it's funny
because a lot of the big really big
youtubers I have trouble connecting with
them for some reason like there's
something blocking me from feeling like
I can relate to them and connect to them
so it's like Jackie
morley like I feel like I'm good on them
but there's I mean it's really hard for
me to find a big youtuber that I'm like
yeah okay cool a Jackie I just recently
discovered randomly I don't know why I
haven't been following her but I really
like her channel um what compared to
make a boss in this month I didn't even
do it on purpose
um yeah we don't
I didn't sound Selby's in email but I'll
think I don't think these are earlier on
the on which calling you one I'm sorry
total brain part but what a CafePress is
where we sold through these five all
right moving on moving on model Co blush
and cheek powder and peach Bellini I
really like model Co blushes they're a
brand that is in a lot of subscription
boxes but I don't see people talk about
them I don't see them on Instagram I
don't see them like people talking about
them on YouTube like it just seems like
one of those like Oh Jackie
I'm not a AI and AI think is how you how
you pronounce are you how you spell it
sorry I had to get up early to extra
early display that's why I have makeup
on and everything but anyway I really
like model Co blushes they're wonderful
alright this is another really good one
that I'm gonna start using again now
that it's summer again this is the
essence blush up powder blush in
heatwave essence makes fantastic blushes
and that's next on my list is my essence
brand review its next after I'd finished
the UM the bomb the bomb brand ru which
I already filmed this essence is going
to be next I that's what I want to do I
can't guarantee anything that's what I
want to do so yes oh um
tabatha says people want to do super
check I turned off the super chat and
I'll tell you why I turned off the super
chat I turned it off because I just did
the makeup geek uh cream same one not
for anything
yeah the creeps think mega peak cream
stains I still have the more raw talent
that I the rock collection that I have
to that was super chat money and then I
have the the kale polish nail polishes
and I have some donations that are just
kind of
sitting so I am NOT I deactivated it
because right now I'm good on all of
that I don't want to get overwhelmed
with products that I bought and then not
review them
I want to space it out because I want
your money to go towards products that
I'm reviewing for the channel and if I
get too many all at once then I can't
get the videos out so I turned it off um
so I'm sorry I will turn it back on
eventually once I get those out oh and
then I got the UM the Lisa Frank
collection the trapper keeper stuff from
glamour dolls but I don't know when
that's going to come so yeah so I turned
off the super chap for this but I will
let you know what its back or you'll be
able to see it now that says we'll talk
about patreon later I don't feel
comfortable doing patreon it's not my
thing
it's not my thing I don't feel I don't
feel it's something that's wrong with me
like you know when you get that you
don't really know why but you get that
gut feeling that you just I don't feel
good about patreon your channel I don't
I don't know why I don't feel it's good
um anyway moving on to blushes vector
closures Laura Mercier pink mosaic this
is a really beautiful blush it's kind of
a highlight in a blush and that's why I
really don't reach for it very often cuz
I I I'm like oh it's a highlight it's a
blush and so what end up in the blush
bar but it's more of a highlight so I
really should put it in my highlight
drawer but it stuff of lush - it kind of
reminds me of the blush that's in the
what you call it in the Pirates of the
Caribbean collection I'm actually
wearing that one today where it's kind
of both so yeah so I'm definitely
keeping that you know I think it's not
only oh another one I'm not empty
cluttered a single thing yet I'm failing
hard I am failing hard okay oh my
goodness Carla says she's a patient
first but I could not miss the chat just
allergies cold okay the nurse you're
asking me what I'm watching I'm
recommending you all tell a my local I
go to she probably the same patient
first that I go to tell your baby girl I
said hello Carla's a on your program
anyway Frog Prince cream blush this
I really really like a lot the Frog
Prince collection by lipstick queen
I love the lipstick I love the blush I
hated the lip gloss the lip gloss was
awful because left like a green like a
dark green tint along with changing to
like a pink so with this weird mix of
green and pink it was weird and it had
these crazy thick green glitters in it
that didn't go away
so like when the lip gloss were off the
glitters were still there so you ended
up with my regular lips with green
glitter and it was just it's just a
weirdest product so don't recommend the
lip gloss but I really like the flush in
the lipstick a lot I actually wear this
quite often it's probably my most used
cream blush and really love that a lot
oh my god Stan you're doing terrible
sorry if I just shout in here I just
realized my my microphone I'm so sorry
um okay so then another model code blush
this one's an amaretto sunset another
one I reach for all the time really love
this let me feel better Carlos or I
don't think I sent that I hope you feel
better a little my makeup says have you
tried Hello Sailor I haven't tried it
yet and there's the hello is it hello
sunshine a new one I want to try them
but you're so stinking expensive you
know like when it was full upset you
know I don't know I I don't know and
it's like I bought the one lorac
lipstick the duo $24 like really really
anyway Kat Von D blushes are along with
the the balm ones are my Holy Grail
blush formula the old one that you can't
get anymore and I don't know I want to
shake her
I should have next time there's Kat Von
D at a excuse me I had a show that I go
to like they were I'm at the the artists
for Kat Von D we're at the show and I
wish I thought to tell them tell her to
bring back four original blush formula
it was so good
this is bellissimo which eye look you
can't get that anymore and then this one
is Essex which is my favorite favorite
favorite favorite favorite shade of all
time it's amazing sherry says Jen would
you please review the ordinary makeup I
have a bunch of the ordinary skincare I
thought I want to do a review on I've
been using it for the past month or so
I'm giving them a nice draw so hopefully
that will be coming to channel I would
really like for it to I don't know about
the makeup though I haven't I haven't
down within that yet um but I'm thinking
about it I'm thinking about it um okay
II pearl blush trio I got this at IMATS
a couple years ago I really like this a
lot
one thing I love about the Yves pearl
line is that it's all for your skin
tones so they say okay this this instead
of like you know in Loretto and and you
know pink fluff and all these different
names for the blushes and the colors
they have these are for light user for
medium and these are from deep and of
course and I think there's a bunch of
ranges between it's like five or six
different shade but of course you don't
have to stick with that but it's just
kind of their recommendation and I just
love that concept so this is the sweet
cheeks light and what you can do is you
can do the shades individual you can do
kind of that draping thing with this
kind of almost contouring with it if you
want to like almost do with a highlight
a middle and then a contour and kind of
stripe it out and blend it together or
you can do them all together or you can
just pick two to put together and I
really love this and its really good
with a fan brush
where's might you puts my each pearl fan
brush that I bought at the same time
which I love this brush so you can go
this way down them or you can kind of go
back and forth I wish these pans were a
little bit lower I feel like they um
they're a little bit high the pan sets
really deep in them so I think if they
were a little bit lower it would be
easier to get the brush in all of them
but it works the works then really love
that and I'm still not to clutter
anything this is supposed to be a
declutter Jen okay this is be a
bombshell sweet cheeks blush this is old
and I don't use a lot even though it's
nice I don't use it a lot and I like I
mean I don't know I don't know I've got
a hundred shades like this do I need
this in my life
I feel like I'm being pressured in my
work right now to declutter something
but it's all old it Oh should I even
declutter it or should throw it away but
it's a powder product I don't know I'll
declutter it and make sure that people
know that it's all then I want them
Alex says happy catching you live happy
here snazzy says sad bah it's ten
degrees if there's anything else okay
alright move it off this is the NARS
blush in fervor and this one it's the
dual intensity blush and for me I only
need it wanted him to be onion at the
lowest level of attention a karen says
pitch and it's old okay
and she's like oh no she's going to be
glitter rule okay I'll pitch it it's old
you're right you're right okay I do
really like this though they're
beautiful shades loose watch these for
you
and again you can put these together or
you can do them separately see that but
yeah they're beautiful I really love
this one because it's got a little bit
of a shine to it but it's not glittery
in any way okay this is again also very
old but I think I'm going to keep this
one I can't why why so our community
flutter buff is why why why do I need
ninety shades of pink
this is stupid it's stupid it's stupid
probably because a lot of my blushes are
more higher-end so it's hard for me to
pass part with something that I spent so
much time like so much money on and I
don't know there's something wrong with
the account but I do love this one this
one isn't expensive and it's beautiful
when you can't even get this anymore the
wet and wild pearlescent pink color icon
blush this is this is amazing
I love this it does have a little bit of
sparkling glitter in it 54 they like it
now that he says you need to tell her I
know why even have one I had a black one
I was using for swatches and all in the
one of their look oh it's way over there
through the the maze I might go get it
in a second so we're the motors okay it
cosmetics ombre radiance blush how
beautiful this is
how much do I use this I never use it I
should though because it's beautiful I
love the ombre bronzer I haven't used
the blush as much people really like it
a lot I'm not I'm not I'm not
decluttering anything okay this is
something I could probably
cluttered okay this is from a
subscription box it's very nice it's
called happy hibiscus and spice therapy
and botanicals but I have to get rid of
something how to I have to do something
I like it but I have to declutter
something so I'm gonna get that's the
only reason this is new to my collection
this is the lorac a lubob blush from
there my heart brunch collection I love
brunch progression and I'm sorry I got
distracted by comments Nancy said there
never been like Jen seen him it's a
blushes I didn't eat I didn't either
but I do really like this it's very
subtle doesn't look subtle there but
when you blend it out it's very subtle
but it's very pretty and I don't have
anything else like this one it's light
one all right
see I'm not to clutter anything this is
terrible I'm gonna stop talking about
the fact that I'm not the clubbing
anything so I'm sure that that's getting
away all right Sweet Pea bye Becca this
is one I love well hope I use this a lot
in the winter time I think it looks
beautiful in the winter time Oh buddy if
you can see that but it's like almost a
bronzer like on the edge of a bronzer
but it's so pretty
Melissa that's wet and wild reformulate
their blushes and change the packaging
for those blushes that's what I heard I
heard they're not as good I heard my
mom's good okay or oh there's more tart
in here okay two more chart blushes
ecstatic and bliss fold and I already
have it set don't tell me I was even
this no effort embellish
all these keys right now I don't have it
static okay I feel better now
ecstatic and blissful then these came in
this set do I mean I think what I'm
gonna have to do after this video is
over is just open them all up lay them
all out on the floor and you like do I
really need it gems you really need at
which shades are exactly the same but
looking at them like this I can't really
tell which ones I already have but it's
like 90 shades of pink over here like 50
shades of grey we got 90 shades of pink
Briana says so excited to catch you live
I've been watching for a few years but I
never seem to catch the live stream I
love you and your honest opinions oh
thank you so much Emily Lowe start blush
as Elizabeth says is anyone have any
opinions on the NYX blush as I've heard
mixed things the only mixed blush is
that I have the old formula so I haven't
tried NYX questions in a while so I
don't wanna Oh wanna say blush I'm
wearing right now Abby is from the
higher to the Caribbean collection by
lorac it's the shimmery blush shade
that's in there speaking of next blushes
this is the NYX baked blush illuminator
luminite illuminator
yeah and bronzer over mater and bronzer
what's this isn't a problem it's very
light I'm a man in declutter this one
and then reach for it so I don't have a
memory for it okay this is one that's
really nice so this is the essence silky
touch blush really like this is very
similar now looking at it to the lorac
it's like on the cheeks it'll probably
look exactly the same as the lorac this
is the essence and then this is the
lorac so if you are looking at getting
the lorac this is the essence one and
adorable it's very similar the essence
one is a tiny tiny bit each year but
they're very similar so you think that I
doubt is that I would do but I'm keeping
it anyway but keeping it RG way this cut
came as a set it's a it's a little cream
highlighter and blush duo I never use
these I never think to use it it gets
lost I'm gonna go ahead and be cluttered
out so I'm now declutter three things
and I throw it away two things a box
what
all right no our speaking guards they
don't have a lot of NARS blushes because
they're stupid stupid expensive and I
haven't used this very much this was I
think these for a birthday gift I don't
say this is in we blue geo you Lu Bu
something like that I don't know how to
say apologize if I'm being disrespectful
to somebody by butchering that name I
think a Robert Goulet and I can did that
but it's kind of deep Emily wants to
know - the essence flushes laughs on the
cheeks yes that one doesn't as much
though because it's so light but the
darker ones Jo
Connie sessions and careful cleaning
blushes and Barbara says the one you
just decluttered was a highlighter this
one I guess technically but it's a very
blush highlighter I mean it all right
I'm going to keep this NARS I don't
think I've ever even used this like when
I just put my finger in it I left the
finger marks I'm even able even use this
the roush gift thank you so much for
clarifying that
Denise I appreciate it okay thirty
minutes in and we're almost done with
the blushes okay this is the butter
blush by physicians formula and I did
purchase this when it was brand new it
doesn't show up on my skin so I'm gonna
declutter that if I'll try to find a
very light skinned person to put this on
to get this to maybe Megan make it
Morton maybe he's one of my she's kind
of she's like a she's a reporter
ish she's not officially listed this
reporter but she's one of my facebook
admins and she's amazing but she's a
reporter she's a reporter she just like
somehow doesn't get credited anymore I
need to fix that and figure that out all
right this is the Jake at Beauty
lovestruck blush these are amazing
absolutely amazing
and I love the shade and I'm going to
keep it even though it's very old
these last really really well on the
cheeks they are the very inexpensive I
think you can still get them at Ulta
calm and not sure can get them in store
anymore but they're very nice Aska says
that butter blush doesn't seem to show
up on anyone
mmm Ashley says love Physicians Formula
butter blush and bronzers I like the
bronzer a better than the blush the
buxom show up off okay this is Make Up
For Ever HD this is a cream blush I
believe yeah it was when I was going
through my coral phase going through
like a peach and coral phase for a while
where I thought those colors look good
on me since it's a cream product I don't
feel comfortable passing along because
of its age so I'm going to go ahead and
keep that a little bit longer but I'll
probably on occasion thrown away
eventually Nikita says you always speak
highly of Jake I I do like Jake hey I
feel like they're highlighters are a
little too glittery the new ones I mean
they went a little overboard on all
right Bobby Brown I think this is
another cream product yes I really like
this one nope these shades nice this one
is in blushed Rhodes as with the Zen had
a coral phase yes it was about two years
ago when I was filming on my porch back
up one time ago all right Kevin a Quan I
think I got this in a eulogy at reach
for it but the price of this thing is
insane and it's a cream product so I
can't really pass it on so many go ahead
and keep it could have thought that
alone this one is doll ten another cream
product can't pass it along because of
its age and it's beautiful shade ooh
it's got like a film I can't have to
throw this away it's got like a film on
it I don't know maybe if I break through
the film i just dry and we says be more
hard yet I know I can't I can't do it at
Isis cream products scare me they're not
scary you just put them on and you smack
yourself in the face a few times to
blend it out and you're good or use a
stippling brush the elf stippling brush
with break boards perfect but I think
I'm going to keep this cream product um
let's smell bad or anything so I'm going
to keep it Steph says toss
like this open on hand I'll just keep
wiping you took those a good guess
thanks I'll do that okay we're almost
there were almost there are at
Kardashian I actually really like this
this was an impulse buy Fowler says it's
okay general he's given me the problem
yes
um bitch I said smack myself in the face
lol that's encouraging that's what you
do though you go like this and kind of
Pat it in you know what I mean okay this
is like a purpley shade and I really
like it
and lastly power was actually really
good on this even though I'm not a big
fan of the Kardashians in general I do
really like this okay they're minerals
I'll antique white or anything what is
coming down oh I see something on the
spot I see two three okay we're coming
up on some things I'm decluttering
pretty much everything that I have left
on because cluttering so it's gonna be
something alex says do you like the
chart blushes yes I do I don't think
that they're as good as the hype though
look I feel like I definitely like the
bomb wash is way better than the tart
blushes I feel like the tart blushes
don't last as long mary says is your
nail-polish KL yes it is and you can see
the chip right there plus less than 24
hours these have been on and I've got
chip there and I've got chips there and
I do have a top coat on so um but anyway
bareMinerals enchanted beauty I have not
hardly use this I think I got this in a
Bare Minerals mystery box and I'm
keeping keeping everything I think I'm
gonna have to do what I said earlier I'm
gonna happen kind of ladies out this is
one I'm definitely decluttering this is
the Coastal Scents forever blush it's
too pigmented it's crazy how pigmented
this is it's just ridiculous it's too
much it's too much I can't handle it so
I'm gonna go ahead alright this is super
old this is really old this is the
Mirabella jewelry box collection semi
precious marble blush I really like this
when I first started my channel it was
one my favorite blushes but it's really
old I'm going to get rid of that like
five six years old and some people say
you don't have to throw away powder
products but I feel like I want to get
rid of things that are five years or
more old the recommendation for powder
products is I think at most three years
but I thought when your circuit is that
five-year mark time you let it go
letting money
moosh walk Paris oh um who sent this to
me this um oh I can picture her face
Jan and Shannon said this to me from
Canada I really like this a lot I'm
actually not going to be part of this I
really like this this is in the shade
rose and it's my only experience with
boudoir makeup and I really like it
and like I said I've never heard of
Mirabella it's one of those like brands
that people don't really talk about
tronic model co and things like that you
can sometimes find them on HauteLook
they do make some really nice products
Christina says where can i buy for
dashing products egg out of the
drugstore a freight which drugstore i
can't remember but it's a drugstore
brand jane says you used to be able to
buy it I'll tell ya that's true AJ says
have you tried any makeup revolution
single blushes nope not yet I don't
think yes no I have I do have one yes
and I liked it I do have one who talked
about last week yes Kayla says when I do
my blush declutter I went for and wore
all my blushes and made my decisions
from there colors that I thought I liked
and didn't formulas didn't work as my
biggest issue I think that's a really
really smart thing to do that's kind of
take me a long time we can get through
everything but that's really smart
it's very smart okay this is another
product it's really old um but I think
I'm going to keep it anyway I said I'm
gonna declutter and now I'm looking at
everything to keep it this is my
everyday minerals and it's the shade
girl Friday it's the only full-size
cheap product I bought from them I think
this is probably four years old at this
point it's beautiful
it's so beautiful um Melissa says Jenna
how do you tell how long you used your
makeup I just I remember using like I
remember the video I did on this and it
was probably four years ago to video
needs in this so I really just kind of
do it by when I did my video like I
remember doing videos on some
these products so and I remember the
terrible backgrounds on this video
that's how I remember but there's lots
of ways to do I mean just taking a piece
of masking tape and writing the date on
the back - super smart you get this
fancy label makers and things but I find
those things fall off the label maker
labels the ones at least the ones that I
used to use the ones that were like
really hard you peeled away the plastic
I'm sure they've improved the technology
at this point but I'm going to keep it
this is terrible okay color pop blush
and birthday suit oh my gosh
look at that I'm gonna throw that away
that does not look good
what happened to you it's not dried out
it just crumbly smells weird - I don't
really like it though
I let color cut cheek products a deal a
lot you're very nice I don't have that
many hello from Columbia Laura hello I
do not own any Milani blushes I don't
have a single Milani blush just
something I haven't invested in she's
talking to me Sarah says Milan E's come
with their parts the one the one who
just came out look gorgeous last thing
in here is absolutely work blush balm I
know I got this a generation Beauty I
hope use it don't smell like anything I
haven't used it so I'm gonna have to use
it and see if I can swatch book put
absolute New York um right there I tried
some of their products that they gave me
and they were very hit and miss it's
beautiful it's very pretty in the keep
it keeping everything so basically this
declutter and keeping everything this is
the worst I've done by far the worst
I've done this right here is what I'm
when I'm talking along it's horrible and
then there's three that I can't reach
the left along the way and then I peepee
everything else and it doesn't even fit
and to make a big box like it's
overflowing
this is terrible I did really bad Pawnee
says I was really disappointed and
flower beauty
that says the colour-pop probably dried
out you're probably right so yeah major
major decluttering fail so I'm just
going to spend some time with these and
some evaluation and some of deep thought
with my blushes to do better I've done a
lot of decluttering videos and this was
good really successful but intercom it's
alright I'm over there okay let's get
into brushes so what should we start
with should we start with eye brushes or
face breakfast let's do the face brushes
because they're bigger and we'll just
pull out we'll do a bunch of face
brushes and then maybe we'll do some eye
brushes at C it's 1044 so maybe we'll
spend 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 50 51 like 52 we'll
do like seven minutes of face brushes
and then we'll do like seven minutes of
eye brushes and then we'll be done so
okay what do we even do with this what
what do I even do with all like how did
this even work oh I forgot talked about
the insane left by the ball these are
amazing
these were hiding behind there these are
all being pets of course and then down
boy
I have as well I have four insane
brushes and I have down boy
whoo face punched so let's talk about
different sizes of what I used before so
the difference between a power brush and
a blush brush for me personally to me
these are powder brushes they're very
fluffy I like the round ones like I like
this one better than this one this one
is a little bit weird if we're gonna get
this one oh this was in a beauty lush
lucky bag it's like a Hakka Hodor brush
or something but it's kind of scratchy
feeling and I'm not that big of a fan of
this one I like the Coastal Scents ones
who've been better but yeah these are
very fluffy so I really like these for
powder so I've got a ton of these let's
see if I can just pull out all powder
ones got this big one from ELF
these things are amazing if you haven't
tried the elf blush lock-up brush line
the ones that have the plastic on the
bottom is so good that I'm shocked at
how much I like them
I've got this one this is the sheik
powder brush from it cosmetics i love
this one because it's got the dome
love that Ilan's this one is I believe
royal and langnickel see that word
well-loved hey this one is kind of om
setup central difference queen a blush
brush and a power brush for me so the
blush brushes are a little more debt so
for example like this one right here I
use for blush and contouring I love this
shape for blush and contouring a good
dome shape right there love love love
especially for blush um let's see
where's another blush brush so anything
more dense than these like this one I
could use for blush or powder it's
really just kind of what I end up using
this is a julep brush these are very
heavy by the way the dresses they're
really nice but do I need all these now
I don't need all these I'm going to go
ahead and pass along the on but for the
photo one because they don't really like
very much and more powder brushes this
one is a Coastal Scents wand and then
here's another julep one of these the
same brush
this says bronze or they're the same
stick a brush they're the same brush I'm
going to pass along the clean one that
oh I just dropped it on my blush whoo
it's okay it's alright I'm gonna pass on
the clean one I'll keep the dirty one
that's the exact same snicker brush it
brushes are soap recipe pint-size says I
actually really like those techniques
face brushes new to me too Emily says
what well brushes are amazing I haven't
tried though they came out with that one
flat head and it looked very interesting
but I didn't buy any of them this is a
row and langnickel powder brush it's
very similar to the it cosmetics one
well no should you have two of the same
brush however this is more than two I
mean do I need all of these now I don't
need all of this let's see are there any
more please make sure that I've gotten
all the ones that are like these big
huge babies right here I think I've
gotten all the big ones
so let's keep four of them I think
that's fair keeping four right so we're
definitely going to keep this one it
cosmetics one and we'll definitely keep
this elf one
and then we'll keep the Mota one and one
more one more
julep we're going to keep jeweler that
one's a little bit different ever in a
past nice and long I do really like this
thing the purple one so pretty it came
in a set from wearing my nickel let's
see Judas says I like my Sephora brushes
to have a very month more to clean on
now right I know new Sonia says QVC's
the best way to play it by it cosmetics
brushes that's smart
mmm hurry up okay let's do our list
different kind of brush let's get
blessed brushes so ones that I use for
blush so we'll do these guys just gonna
hold these up via the it cosmetics dual
and then I'm going to get rid of that
because I'm not a big fan through and it
brush it even though they're both really
really nice let's see these are a little
harder to find
oh my gosh a saddle brush that I really
liked it's a face brushes this this is a
the beauty junkies Pro highlighter brush
I love use for highlighter especially
for super pigmented highlighters I love
this style alpha heavy on the Sigma
version of it and I really like that
it's the Sigma one yeah this is the
Sigma tapered highlighter f-35 this
one's real nice if the exact same stick
and brush that's the exact same thing
except if there was a little different
and the bond is a little different this
the Sigma is rounded but this one's flat
exact same brush okay let's get more
blush brushes out
forget them did I get home hold on
I saw a man standing okay that's good
good enough okay I'm sure there's more
but no one needs this many blush brushes
I'm going to keep my elf blush brush I
love that one I've been really loving
this elf one this is from the new
collection it's got these little
coquÃ­'s there but it really helps is
almost like a mixture between a blush
brush and it's a traditional blush brush
and a stippling brush inspect these
little tiny hairs I hope you can see
that it's really cool so definitely
keeping that so that's two definitely
this one Real Techniques the the bold
metals blush brush really love this one
this one's more dense so this one's
really nice for let for less pigmented
blush is very nice
okay that's three let's keep one more
okay so we've got Basanti we this is
peach and pearl this is Vasanti this is
postal sets and this is everyday
minerals I've had this one a really long
time I like the more domi ones so let's
keep the peach and pearl one they did
send these to me for um for just to try
out with no obligation review but I
really like the peach and pull of what
brushes so these are going to be deep
buttered goodbye it's kind of painful
kind of painful okay so now let's do a
little bit actually list of a foundation
brush first so let's do flat top kabuki
and then after flat top kabuki so we'll
do eyes eye brushes and that goal will
probably gonna have time for
okay what about a lot of these I thought
I did come on
Oh drive to load up now I'm sitting here
thinking kicking myself for not doing a
better job of organizing you before I
apologize for the wait okay so I got
five of these so we'll get rid of one of
them and I'm going to get rid of the
squirrel and langnickel one it's not
dense enough I don't really like this
one this one is the revolution one that
the x20 I don't really like that one so
I'm going to declutter that one and I'm
going oh I didn't tell you what they
were so this one is the flat kabuki by
beauty junkies this one is our beauty
and then this one is flat angled kabuki
by beauty junkies and this one is the
Sigma flat kabuki at 80 so you can see
that they're all kind of similar but you
want to keep those um let's see Ashley
says wow Jenn is getting cut her throat
on the brushes those thousand brushes
are feeling relieved I know right these
are driving me nuts though the brushes
are like they don't drive me nuts these
things drive me nuts
okay because I can't ever find what I
want so let's go ahead and I'm just
going to dig in and grab actually let me
get some of these brushes out of here
here's one that I don't like this is a
bareMinerals brush I don't even know
what this thing is maybe someone will
want it maybe someone large I don't know
if anybody's going to want that
breakfast so ugly this is another one I
don't use this is a makeup forever brush
these are really great for face masks
and stuff but this one's really thick so
I don't like it for face masks I think
that that was in a generation Beauty
swag bag oh here's another one that I
don't really like these makeup forever
just make forever brush set is very odd
actually this one's kind of neat maybe I
won't be shot
we're trying to get these big dresses
out of the way so that I can get to the
smaller brushes this is one I'm gonna
declutter this is the julep fan brush
it's too big for my face I don't like it
this is another one I'm going to
declutter this is the morphe m40 one
this brush is it's very fluffy and but I
don't like the shape of it either
there's very few more if I've never
tried a morphe brush that I liked but I
also haven't tried that many so um Steph
says that brush looks like Don King's
hair kinda did a little bit now thinking
about how spike
was we I'm going to be quite a bit
marking brush I don't like it okay I'm
trying to get down to the eye brushes
they're just hiding underneath all of
these other breakfast oh here's a motor
brush that I don't like very rare you
don't like a motor brush this one right
here this is the royal and langnickel
clip contour brush this is from there
Moda line and it's heart-shaped and what
you're supposed to do is contour like
this it's very difficult to work with
and I don't feel like it applies very
nicely so I'm going to be cluttered up
my Andrea says I really want some with
rose gold medal royal and langnickel
just give out with a rose gold line they
did they did I don't even know for me to
be able to reach my face my I brush if
I've so many I brush it
it's insane I'm just going to grab a
hand tool out of here and a lot of them
look almost exactly the same insane I'm
you're not going to be able to hold all
of them okay let's do the fluffy
blending brushes fluffy blending brushes
ooh I don't like this one this one is
another one of the royal and langnickel
revolution bx9 bees it's just a weird
shape I think I got this in a boxy charm
it's just very okay
so many so many okay Emily's ease out
flow and have the fine the gal from the
Midwest ray woo I feel like I just
spending all this time digging and I
feel bad whoa what was that oh that was
that I'm definitely keeping this one
this is the Real Techniques blush brush
I love this for face powder why are you
saying all those no all right by julep
you're going there's no reason for you
to exist when this exists working on
instead oh I found another one this is
another see I don't I'm not a big fan of
the world line of a revolution line this
is the B X zero zero it's too dense for
powder and it's too big from bronze
around block so I'm going to get rid of
that one it's mMmmm Therese once Therese
I hope I said that right
Therese chorus I'm going to say crease
marzo ever I brush is any good I haven't
tried any
I don't know sherry says NYX has good
blending brush nice
trying to pick out more these blending
style
but some of them are longer some of them
are shorter so I'm going to be a little
less rude along these oh boy this is
good so these are all blood of
dysphemism I love that one man
okay these are not that one either but
what is happening here not that one you
and draw blending south nope not want me
there these are all blending style
brushes and some of them are very
similar so we're going to take these are
all super similar so we're going to keep
keep three of these so we have a purple
one for boil and langnickel the Sheep
crease brush from it cosmetics the
beauty junkies pro crease brush we have
a Luxy 2:05 2:05 and Alexei 2:05 I have
two of these so we definitely don't need
both of those so it would be cluttered
the cleaner one and the one that seems a
little more packed and then we'll keep
these these boosting effects box out of
ten key three we don't need both of
these the lux idiot cosmetics Lexie's a
little longer the ax-cut mix a little
shorter get rid of it Cosmetics Oh
breaking my heart breaking my heart
these I'm going to well this one right
here I'm going to keep this is the luxe
E 237
I love how small it is so it's really
nice to blend like right into the crease
for really for like more fun like
fine-tuning kind of thing
What did he say these speaks the truth
girl you better not get rid of any luck
C brushes I know right I love what C
definite okay this is another style I
have a ton of they're like flatter
blending brushes so sometimes they use
these actually for packing on color but
like a lighter amount of color so
difference between like this and why
find one that I use like pack the color
like this so like this one is more dense
where this one is longer and fluffier
so both the fluffier brush is the less
color it's going to pick up because the
color kicks up on the bristles so can
house less person is going to pick up
less product so I have a lot of these
style of brushes see if I can pick them
out it's another one I really really
like a flat shader brush this is a rail
and langnickel
lucien bx 75 I really like this one okay
let me sick a lot of uses we're all
hiding they don't want to be thrown it
they don't want to be the clutter
they're like no don't find me but they
don't find it mommy I don't want to be
Big Love but why - - so you fall not
take a little you oh here's another one
this is the Sigma tapered one he rushed
me 40 I guess I better get rid of
another brush Oh
so I love this look it's almost the
exact same brush and this one's purple
but this one's fluffier this one's
longer and fluffier I'm keeping it
anyway I'm not getting rid of that no
it's not going to happen no I say no to
you seriously Jen is another one oh
don't talk the Christian okay we're
almost out of time
so I gotta hurry up okay so these are
all pretty much the same brush so these
are the kind of fluffy shader ones
I like them all but I don't think that
okay we're going to get rid of their
because are pretty much the same brush
there's no reason we're going to get rid
of the pro detailer okay we'll get rid
of this Coastal Scents one it's very
good though it's very very good um get
rid of the whirling language well this
one's thinner though it's different
because it's thinner damn keeping them
all okay this is a pro detailer by
beauty junkie this is the royal and
langnickel Mota one and then this is the
chart one that I think came with
something I don't think I bought that
separately and then this one is the
Sigma blending e 25 so I'm in people
with these so this one's flat since mums
get better for packing on color for like
more coiled types of shadows a bit
that's all
okay unfortunately we are out of time
which breaks more because you have so
many brushes left so many brushes I
don't know should we do a brush
declutter again next week
no I'm done with decluttering I think I
need to move on from decluttering so I'm
going to go ahead and let it go
Oh Stevie's gross said something's and
he junky brushes are so affordable and
great and I haven't gotten him in a long
time I've heard you spend some quality
control issues at beauty junkies at
least a while back I guess was about six
months to a year ago somebody told me
they got some in all of you junky
brushes fell apart which I don't know
anything about so I hate to endorse a
brand where I had tried their stuff in a
while and someone said that it wasn't
good but I don't know I don't know I'd
love to know your thoughts on different
brush brands and different things down
in the comments so I can learn from you
