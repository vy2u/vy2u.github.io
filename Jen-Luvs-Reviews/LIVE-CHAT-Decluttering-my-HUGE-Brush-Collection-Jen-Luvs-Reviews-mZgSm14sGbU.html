own voice I don't know if I'm loved yes
I think I am hello my friends welcome to
the watts of the makeup chats
I missed you very much I have not seen
you in two weeks and I am very excited
to be back in the whatsapp and makeup
chat I had a couple minutes to do a
little bit of makeup on my face which is
very unusual for a chat so that was why
I was brought in like one minute late is
I want to put on some lipstick because I
wasn't quite there yet so anyway today
we are going to be decluttering my brush
collection and I actually realized I
need to put the brushes I just used back
in I was trying to use minimal brushes
so I didn't mess up my system here I was
up late last night because I wanted to
organize the brush collection so will be
easier to go through so I've got these
brushes here we're going to go through
I've got these brushes here and a few
pairs of scissors but we won't declutter
the scissors we've got oh my goodness
this is going to fall we've got these
brushes here and I've got each set of
brushes that are similar in a hair tie
so that we can declutter ones that are
similar I've got these brushes here and
then I've got these brushes here there's
no reason to have all of these and
somebody was saying you know you don't
really need to declutter brushes because
you know you can always use brushes they
don't go bad and that's really really
true but at the same time I want to be
able to find the brushes that I really
really love so that is why I need to
declutter my brush collection I said
last time we were in chat that the
decluttering was over but I got so many
requests to continue the brush declutter
that we didn't finish that that's why
we're doing it today now if we have time
afterward we'll just do like some like
loose Q&amp;amp;A discussion kind of stuff just
a disclaimer very quickly to anyone that
has never been to one of my live chats
first of all hello and welcome I do
invite a group of people into my home
who are just people that are subscribed
to the channel that know that the GLAAD
chat exists
and if you ever want to know when the
live chat is happening you just need to
watch the end of whatsapp and make up on
Sunday mornings it's also written in the
description if you don't want to scrub
forward to the end I always tell you
then what the deal is with chat um so if
you do not enjoy me talking to people in
chat I'm really sorry that is the way
that I choose to do my chats because I
feel like I learned so much from them
that I feel like I need to talk to them
I was a little bit in my other chat that
I did this week I was trying out
something new trying to get through the
information and then talk to people it
didn't go well I'm not going to do that
anymore it's not me it's not who I am
I'm gonna talk to people in chat so
anyway on to the brush declutter
actually no not on to the brush
declutter I need to say hello to the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
also known as the people that are in the
chat right now divinity is here she says
Jen you're amazing thank you divinity
Katherine downing is here check out her
YouTube channel Elijah is here good
morning to you good morning to Afilias
she said oh it world of a feeling she
says hi John my name is Edna and it's my
first time catching a live chat all is
so wonderful to have you here good
morning Stephanie good morning Nadine
and Mary good morning reading mom is
here Chrissy is here Vicky and Abbey
Michelle are wonderful reporter and
Facebook admin Michelle is here Jennifer
is here Abby's here Mimi's here Tabitha
B my production manager and all over
awesome person is here morning -
Samantha Denise and kin and Kaitlyn and
everybody else that I didn't get a
chance to say good morning - good
morning to you so let's go ahead and get
into the chat so let's go ahead and
start with let's go big to small so
we're going to start with big brushes
really big brushes and what I use these
for so for a long time I was using big
brushes like this for any kind of powder
so I was using it for setting powder I
was using it for finishing powder and I
watched a video by Wayne Goss not that
long ago where he was talking about
pressing the setting powder into your
skin with a more dense brush or with one
of the pads that comes with your setting
powder yeah setting powder no yeah
setting powder not finishing
so I stopped using these big fluffy
brushes for the setting pattern started
just using them for finishing powder and
I'll show you the ones that I've been
recently using for setting powder and I
really like them and Wayne says there is
a difference between setting powder and
finishing powder I don't know I haven't
I haven't dug enough in new ingredients
or any of that or talked to anybody that
actually knows so I'm going to trust
Wayne and he knows these things so this
actually this is a brush by Tarte and
this actual would probably be pretty
good for for setting powder because it
is more dense on the fluffy of the brush
the less product it picks up and the
more it kind of goes all over it's more
for blending and things like that so
this wouldn't be more for pressing into
the skin so um I don't really like how
big this thing is though so I'm probably
going to declutter this oh I forgot to
get a box argh I forgot to get a place
to put my brushes hold on a second hold
on hold up hold up hold up I'm gonna
take off my microphone for a quick
second hold on dump this out I'll put
them in this bag I had this la / bag
that I just keep other bags in so we'll
just put the decluttered brushes in here
okay
put my mic back on hopefully the mic is
helping okay I've got two of these big
fluffy brushes this one is from ELF and
this one is from royal and langnickel
from their moto line I really feel like
I can use two of them because I feel
like I can um I can be using one and
washing the other things like that so
yeah so I'm going to probably keep both
of these I'll just set those over there
for now
Express a pure soul set setting powder
versus finishing powder there is a
difference usually the pressed powders
you buy in the drugstore those are
usually from my experience meant to be
setting powders so when you put your
makeup on you put your foundation on you
set it with a powder and then at the
very end you take the finishing powder
and you kind of put it all over
everything that's my impression so okay
so then this let's see I've got two
blush brushes two big fluffy blush
brushes this is has been one of my
favorites for a long time this is the
blush brush by
real techniques and honestly I've been
using these more for face powder than I
had them for blush because they're so
fluffy they're so fluffy so I do like
this dome shape though I'm keeping both
of them I like them both
I'm keeping both of them okay this is a
brush that I don't ever use it's more of
a stippling brush style it's my makeup
forever
it's called the straight and wavy brush
I don't really know how to use it so I'm
going to go ahead and pass it on to
someone that may be able to use it let's
say this brush right here this is by
Ecotools I've really enjoyed this brush
but it's similar to some of the other
brushes that I have I'm keeping it
I figure anytime over um over for
brushes I don't need any more than four
brushes per style right Jeff and Andy
Kinney one says hugs hugs back to you AJ
say real techniques are everything
totally agree I love Real Techniques
brushes
Nadine says um girl and meteor oh the
the girl meteorites Nate AO writes made
to your each one of those is an example
of a finishing powder yes that's true
and i have the laura mercier finishing
powder that i've been using recently
that I really like mary says keep as
many blush brushes as you can nice I
should you're right Mary you're
absolutely right
Stephanie says I never figured out how
to use stippling brushes in a way that I
like I have the smaller sibling brushes
that I'll talk a little bit about those
in a little bit and give you some tips
on those at least the way that I use
them marina says I'm so lazy to wash
with them that I would never declutter
brushes shame on me that's okay sherry
says Jenner expenses brush is really
better than affordable ones sometimes
sometimes they are but I don't think
that the majority of them are I think
the majority of them are very similar to
the good quality affordable brushes
there are definitely some cheap
affordable brushes that are cheaply made
that are not worth the money at all but
then there are some affordable brushes
that I feel like are just as good as the
more expensive ones now I don't own like
super high-end brushes but like I own a
couple but not too many so I can't
really compare to those but as far as
like Sigma and things like that and
a couple windows brushes I have a couple
of hukka hodo brushes but not many but I
haven't really seen me personally that
much of a difference but I'm not a
makeup artist and maybe a makeup artist
might see a difference more that I would
that makes sense okay couple more so
we've got Yesenia hisen I've got Yesenia
right here now I'm just like I saw you
Senya across there and then I've got you
saying I've got this crush this was
given in a boxy charm it's way too big I
just I never I'm going to reach for this
I know I'm not gonna reach for it so I'm
going to get rid of that one this is one
of the elf
brushes Nancy was kind enough to send me
some elf some of the elf brush line the
new line I really like it a lot this one
I haven't quite figured out what I want
to do with it as you can see I've been
using it for foundation and it's kind of
fun to play with is it necessary
probably not do I see anything magical
happening no but it's fun so I'm going
to keep it because it's kind of neat and
I don't anything else like it so I'm
gonna keep it so I'm going to go and put
those back in here and let's go ahead
into more foundation a kinds of brushes
so let's see what do I have here okay
these are stippling brushes since we're
talking about sickling brushes let's go
ahead and go into here
Cara says I love the royal and
langnickel Mota line me too three drops
of sunshine says I live for big fan
brushes like that ah what do you use
them for because I don't know what to
use them for I get lost
this one right here uh Bonnie says it's
a great for fallout brush-off yeah
you're probably right
I'm still gonna get rid of it but you're
totally right this one here is a beauty
junkies Pro duo fiber brush I really
like this brush for very pigmented
blushes when blushes are like holy moly
clown face because it's got these little
stippling little pieces up here if you
can see that but it's got these little
pieces up here so it just picks up the
tiniest bit of product so that I can
kind of brush it on without going crazy
it does it does appear streaky at first
though because it's got the stipple
there but then I just kind of Pat it out
and brush and Pat it out and brush and I
really really like this a lot for that
so I'm definitely keeping
this one let's see we'll put that over
here okay I've got a few more stippling
style brushes these are all pretty much
the same these three this one is these
two are both royal and langnickel this
one is the modus Tipler and then this is
the what do they call it the moto
metallics and they're both basically the
same overall I think the modem italics
is supposed to be better quality I feel
like the royal and langnickel the moto
one is a little more dense so I'm
probably actually going to keep this one
and get rid of this one because I don't
need it well you know what this one is
by peach and pearl they're all pretty
much the same I don't think I need this
many can we use this type of brush that
off in so I'm going to get rid of the
peach and purl one oh I like that one
though I don't know I'm going to get rid
of it I don't need it I like these I'm
keeping them and then let's see this
right here this is a Pat McGrath buffer
brush and I haven't quite figured out
how to use this it's kind of weird
it's got like the stippling style
brushes here but then it's got these
weird little brushes on the side like
bristles on the side I don't know what
to do with those you see these over here
it's a little short guys I don't really
know what to do with this thing so I'm
going to look up a tutorial on this and
see if there's any kind of magical thing
that I don't know about this or if you
know anything about this definitely if
you're watching this on replay leave it
in the comments below of what to do with
this brush I think that it came with
supposed to be used with some of the
highlighters but I prefer like pointing
to your brushes that I'll show you in a
minute for highlighters so I don't think
I would use this for highlighter I don't
know I'm going to keep it for now but
I'll probably end up being decluttered
okay so then I have these left this one
I really like this is a crown brush and
is there a number on this anywhere no
but this one's really fun it's more of a
flat style so I like this one from more
pointed like contouring or highlighting
when something's really really pigmented
because it is a stippling style so it
doesn't pick up a ton of product but
it's a really nice way to get just a
little bit of a more concentrated like
in like a smaller area that's what I'm
trying to say in a smaller area so I'm
going to go ahead and keep this one
three drops of sunshine sets get rid of
that when I think so I'm at the the Pat
McGrath when I probably will I probably
will but I want to look it up and make
sure I'm not missing anything first AJ
says I use big fan brush
just for dusting off powder product and
fallout which I I just don't think to do
that
you know like intuitively I don't think
to do that so I I'm just going to get
rid of it even though I probably could
Allison says the Pat McGrath brush will
work well for Wayne's buffing technique
I'll have to look that up alright so
this one here this is the famous elf
small stipple brush so what I use this
for is for cream blushes this is like my
go-to cream blush cream like cream
highlighters it works well for any kind
of cream products because you put it on
like this
and then what I do is I kind of blend it
a little bit and then I poke and then I
blend and then I poke and then I blend I
don't know if that's correct or not but
that's the way I choose to do it and
that's the way it works for me and I
really like it I definitely recommend if
you don't if you own cream products that
are for like blush and a highlight and
contour and you don't own the elf small
stipple brush I definitely recommend
getting it I don't see like I mean it's
it's wonderful it's really wonderful
marina says any soever brushes I do not
have any so ever brushes Allison says I
use that type of brush from it cosmetics
with a finishing or light coverage
powder to buff all the harsh lines
toward the end that's interesting okay
very interesting okay so now there's one
more so this is a this is from the Mona
metallics line and it is I'm assuming
for some kind of like you could probably
use it for like cream contour or you
could use it for foundation or concealer
I personally don't prefer this this
style of brush I don't prefer the way
that it's cut and I don't I just don't
like it so I'm going to pass that one
along not a fan of that one this one
here is by beauty junkies it's their
angled kabuki brush this is great for
cream foundation and for like a cream
foundation that's in like a like in a
dish like the what did I just the bucks
the the bomb the bomb time bomb
foundation I was gonna get it the bone
time bomb foundation I kind of rub it in
there and then slap it all over so it's
really nice it's very very very dense if
you've never tried beauty junkies
brushes these were sent to me for review
a long time ago I still
of them they still work great they're
fantastic so I'm going to keep that one
and then I have more of these
foundational kinds of brushes I thought
I had all of these in a rubber band but
I guess these are just all my foundation
ones okay so this is the Wayne Goss
number-one brush I have never used this
I got this in my beauty lish lucky bag
and I've never used it once and I need
to start using it I think the reason why
is because it's so small for a
foundation brush when I think of a
foundation brush I think of something
like that you know so I need to I need
to use that one it's a fancy schmancy
brush and I need to use it reading
comments from my from my video that went
live today from what's up and makeup
luan who always leaves me nice comments
just left me a sweet comment okay Marc
Jacobs this is the face number 2 brush I
bought this as an impulse buy when I was
out shopping with my friend Sandra that
I met on the whatsapp and makeup app I
bought this when I was with her and I
don't know I did like it for a long time
and then recently I've kind of been like
man I am going to keep it I think it's
like a $52 brush something like that
something stupid I am going to keep it
but I've kind of become disenchanted
with it the flat kabuki by outer beauty
that's another really good another
really good inexpensive brush brand this
is really really nice very very dense
flat kabuki again for blending out
foundation really like it mary says
Wayne Goss brushes are Wayne Goss are
great brushes I only have the two so
Jenny says that's my least-loved Wayne
Goss brush well that's good to know
that's really good to know three drops
of sunshine says the Wayne Goss brush is
his most widely panned of his line I'm
not sure if I quite know what that means
oh maybe people don't like it I'm not
quite sure what that means is saying it
says stippling brushes are best for
cream to pick up and hold on to product
the base of the bristles while the top
feathery bristles give you a smooth
flawless finish there you go you said
yeah this is a Coastal Scents brush they
came in a set I don't these are great
for like face masks and things but I
have a couple that I use for face masks
I don't really need this I'm going to go
ahead and get rid of that one here's
another one that's very similar to the
Wayne Goss one this is by Ecotools if
you
look at it it's very similar that's very
interesting
this is an Ecotools brush it's called
the skin perfecting brush and I've used
it but looks like I haven't really loved
it
like I don't remember ever using it I
need to wash this and pass this on so
someone else can love it because I just
don't I don't prefer that style of brush
another one by beauty junkies their flat
kabuki brush these came in a set I
really like these they're great alright
a few more face brushes okay here's a
round kabuki by beauty junkies same
thing I mean I use these all
interchangeably the flat one the round
one they're all the same to me I don't I
don't really see much difference between
them they're fun oh my goodness is my
husband here
someone everybody's saying hello John oh
my gosh my husband is here hi baby
my husband's on a trip right now so I
sleet hard how are you it's good to see
you thanks for tuning into my live chat
this one here is the elf one of the elf
brushes this one I haven't quite figured
out how to use it kind of reminds me of
the Marc Jacobs brush a little bit but
it's not nearly as dense so I haven't
used it for foundation I tried using it
for blush it was kind of weird so I'm
still playing with that one I'm running
out of room on my chair here let me put
this down here instead not decluttering
enough Jen not decluttering enough okay
another one this is another one of those
flat ones that I don't want look like so
I'm going to get rid of that one this
one is also this one oh this one's by
royal and langnickel it's a foundation
brush that came in their purple set same
thing the beauty junkies flank flat
angled kabuki brush how many these
things do I really need really Jen how
many of these do I need I'm getting rid
of it
Andrea says John is cute thank you so
much I like him too oh he misses me I
miss him too I miss him a lot
okay I have so many of these flat
brushes I don't need all these I've got
I'm like oh I love this brush I use it
interchangeably with this brush and I
use this one in this one and they're all
the same why have them all Coastal
Scents and other one is flat foundation
brushes that I don't like it cosmetics
this is a flat foundation brush this is
the it brushes for Ulta one getting rid
of it
I need to get rid of the ones I don't
use that often okay these flat ones I
need to get rid of some of them because
they're there's too many of them too
many of them exist okay well I've got
three three I think is fine three is
acceptable I can keep three and then
I've got two of these pointy guys this
one is outer beauty and this one is
beauty junkies outer beauty beauty
junkies they're very similar this one's
a little more pointy but I like them
both do I have any other ones that are
like that No
okay so we'll keep those and then
another one of these flat ones this is a
moto one I'm getting rid of that one I
don't like those flat ones I know I
could use them for mass goon buried one
but I just I already have one that I use
for mass and I feel like I don't really
need a bunch of em be used for mass
because it kind of wash them all the
time because it's easy to wash a mass
brush so I don't really need more than
one okay so but you're absolutely right
I can pass them on to somebody else and
Chad says you need all the brushes
sherry says eyes small eyes I still I
have more eye brushes and face ones
that's so funny oh I'm dropping them I'm
dropping them no don't drop them
okay and we put them back in my
container before they all fall on the
floor thank you for your help over here
Kristen says I don't get those pointy
brushes they're nice for getting in the
like right here whereas one right here
for like right thou so I do like them
they're very nice okay so now we're
getting into blush brushes contour
brushes things like that
three up sunshine says I don't like fat
flat brushes why do I keep see I keep
saying your your comments I keep seeing
you you gettin getting lucky to see all
of your comments Julie says I like flat
foundation for setting the under-eye
with powder that's interesting I've
never used that for that
Florrie says good morning good morning
good morning to Florrie decluttering is
going well Trish says how do you use
those pointy kabuki looking brushes oh
so so yeah I just use them for
foundation so it's more of like a brush
when I put on my foundation instead of
like the padding I do more of like
brushing with it it just depends on the
formula so like for like the elf stick
that I love that one I like to brush it
on rather than powder on because it's
very thick so it's just I feel like it
blends better when I kind of
swipe it rather than patting it it works
well - Pat - but you know ooh I'm trying
to print out your name
Burcu I'm going to say Burke who says I
use those for cream contour the pointy
ones very interesting ok these are kind
of rounded blush brushes this is called
a complexion brush by royal and
langnickel but these oh that's duh I
used to use these for blush I don't use
them any for anymore these are the ones
I wanted to tell you that I use for
pressed powder now so this one is by I
used to say this was by skinned Iceland
I said that in a video that is wrong
this is not by skinned Iceland it is by
a brand called skin I believe it's
spelled s ki n n-not skin Iceland that
is a skincare brand but these are the
ones I've been using for the pressed
powder to press it into my skin and I
really like them a lot so again this one
is the complexion brush by the modal
line of royal and langnickel and then
this is by skin okay let me put these
down the ones I'm done with and now
we're going to be moving on to blush
brushes so okay so I've got all these
angled guys these are all angled brushes
for contouring or blush or whatever and
like I don't think I said this
officially you can use brushes for
whatever you want to use brushes for you
don't have to follow anybody's rules you
want to follow my suggestions anybody
else's suggestions if you find a brush
that does something for you then you
should do it that's the way it is it's
pronounced buzu buzu thank you so much
for explaining that to me I appreciate
it that's her name great Stef says why
doesn't ELF have a sale this weekend I
want to buy more brushes the clear
brushes are really really nice they're
very nice Shelby says the best brushes
have ever used are Lancome very good
Shweta Shweta I think is how you
pronounce it I used those pointy ones
for blushes it works well for those as
well fantastic wonderful Allison says am
I the only one who isn't amazed by it
cosmetic brushes I like my yet cosmetic
brushes a lot are they blowing my socks
off and make me go oh uh sometimes not
not all the time but sometimes so I have
a few of these big fat
angled one speaking of it cosmetics I
have a few these big fat ones um hmm I'm
gonna get rid of one of them I'm going
to get rid of this white Coastal Scents
one because it's more dense and I like
the fluffier ones of these so I'm going
to get rid of the white one I don't need
all those and I'm going to keep the
Coastal Scents one this one and then I'm
going to keep this one this is called
the chic brush this came in one of their
sets I think it was last I think was in
the winter this was their set but I'm
going to keep that one then I had these
smaller ones including this one that
came in if see I believe this is the
glamour dolls brush collaboration with
Lisa Frank so far I'm liking it I do
feel that it is a little bit cheaply
made and that this is this is a little
shaky I don't know if you can see that
but it's um it's not made together super
well so I did order the whole Lisa Frank
collection with super chat money so I'm
hoping that it's good and this was a
while ago I don't know when they're
going to ship that stuff out but I'm
starting to get a little like you know I
pay for the self a really long time ago
like is this stuff ever going to ship I
don't know if they're still designing it
or what so you know sherry says no
dual-ended brushes I do have a few I
don't prefer them because I store my
brushes in like cups and containers and
things so it smashes the one end so it's
not my favorite but I mean they're nice
if you if you can store your brushes in
like a bag or something this way but
that's not the way I choose to store
mine but if the brush itself is very
soft and very nice but it's just kind of
cheaply made here but I'm going to keep
it because it's going to go with the
rest of that collection when I review it
oh here's another one of those fluffy
contour kinds of brushes I actually just
use this this is by Eddie Funkhouser
they sent this to me I don't know years
ago it sheds pretty bad it feel I feel
like there's constantly bristles falling
off of this but it is a nice brush so I
am going to pass it on because it does
work it just sheds these are all very
nice this one is probably my favorite
out of them this is the older brands a
brand actually makes some really nice
brushes which is
odd that no one ever talks about them I
think people assume and like kind of
dismiss the Ulta brands for lots of
things because some of it isn't very
good but I do really like this brush I
like that it's more concentrated like
like it's thinner so you can concentrate
the stuff right here
Oh Bonnie's talking what did Bonnie say
everybody's talking to Bonnie I have to
know what Bonnie said Bonnie says it
cosmetic brushes from QVC are better
than the altar line except the lux line
gotcha
yet they're Denley different lines of
the it cosmetics brushes Thank You
Bonnie for mentioning that Lily says
think the Lisa Frank stuff ships in the
fall that's a long time Melissa says
they send weekly emails for updates on
the surveys and what colors use etc and
the money you paid was for their
Kickstarter so that they were even able
to make it yes that makes sense it makes
sense am I just being whiny that I just
want my stuff now I do get the emails
and they're never about when products
are actually coming and I've asked them
on their page when the stuff is actually
coming and they've never answered me so
thank you for answering me but it's just
I want my love oh wow so I'm just being
a baby okay so it's anyway so I've got
these here this one is a will and
langnickel contour brush from that that
purple set and then this is a luck C 504
I love all of these I'm going to keep
those and then this is a Coastal Scents
one I don't need all of them so I'm just
going to get rid of that one okay moving
on I'm going to take my scissors out of
here because these are not getting too
cluttered
moving on to these blush brushes and
face brushes on okay all of these babies
okay let's see okay so these I bought on
sale these are the hakka hodo and
sephora collaboration i heard these are
not as good as the regular hakka hodo
brushes and I just I don't enjoy using
it I'm sure it's a great brush for
someone that knows how to use it but I
just don't enjoy using it it's not fun
for me I've used it for blush I've tried
to use it for for a powder it just it I
don't feel like it's dense enough to use
for foundation so I haven't used it for
that but just don't enjoy it I'm passing
it on let's see okay this brush is
excellent this is one of my favorite
blush
brushes for blushes that build up this
is the real technique bold metals blush
brush it's really really really nice I
love this brush so I'm keeping that one
oh my goodness so many brushes oh
speaking of a double-ended brush this is
a and it cosmetics heavenly luxe
complexion perfection and it's got like
a blush II brush on one side and then an
eyeshadow brush on the other side I'm
pretty sure I got this at generation
Beauty I don't really use this very
often so I'm going to go ahead and pass
that along let's see I'm trying to find
brushes that are similar okay this one
right here this is a nice enough brush
this is by bare minerals I think I got
this in one of their mystery kits
I don't really reach for it it gets lost
in the bottom of my container so I'm
going to go and pass that one along
Andrea's Jenn toss toss toss yes Mimi
says I have the gb/s place read set I
have not tried the ones on whole look I
from my experience the things that are
sold on HauteLook okay this is this is
what I understand the way what look
works for those you've never shopped on
whole look it's a Nordstrom company it's
a flash sale website they have things
like Julia's place and lorac and Becca
and some of those brands they have the
stuff at discount especially the things
that the brand is trying to get rid of
except for Julia's place they just had
like their blush palettes on there this
Herrin palette was on there I'm not sure
if it's still there or not I did pick up
the blush palette the the lighter blush
palette and a set of the brushes on
HauteLook last time but this is my
understanding what they do at home is a
Nordstrom company I think I already said
that what they do is they get the orders
from people on HauteLook then they put
in the order to the brands the brand
ships the products to HauteLook and then
hautelook ships them to you so that's
why shipping takes so long so they do
come directly from the brand so I would
trust anything from my experience I've
never had a problem with things not
being legit from Haute look it's not
like Groupon you know where Groupon they
sell fake stuff on Groupon it's
straight-up fake
I actually what was it was it Twitter I
forget exactly how I communicated with
Anasazi Beverly Hills I think it was
Twitter it was a Twitter email where I
asked him about a modern renaissance
palette that was on there and they said
that it was a fake so do not buy cheap
makeup like inexpensive high-end brands
from Groupon they are probably
fake because they're independent sellers
just so you know that was totally off
topic but anyway so if you get the Juvia
splay stuff it comes directly from
Julia's place so you don't have you
shouldn't have to worry about it at
least that's the impression that I've
been given I can't say that for 100% but
I'm pretty sure that that's true okay so
anyway moving back to brushes alright so
these are kind of similar oh okay so
this is a beauty junkies Pro sculpt
brush I don't really use this very often
the shape of it is a little weird for my
personal taste I'm sure there's lots of
things that somebody can do with them so
I'm going to go ahead and pass them
along Nancy says ever well I wonder if
you could use that weird elf brush for
self tanners that is a really smart idea
Nancy the weird where did it go this one
hold on this one right here
that's smart I'm gonna try it I'll let
you know I will try it definitely okay
this is other hakka hota brush that I
got I've used this for blush again I
don't like that it's not very fluffy for
the bra for the to put on the cheeks it
puts it on in a very condensed way and I
don't really like that so I'm going to
get rid of this let's see I'm trying to
find ones they're similar okay this one
right here is another one that's pretty
dense by peach and pearl I'm going to go
ahead and get rid of this one that's a
very very nice brush this is a very nice
brush brand they actually set me these
brushes and they're really good they
remind me a lot of the Luxy brushes
they're very nice but it's just not I
don't use that style of brush so I'm
going to get rid of that one
okay this one's really cool I actually
got this one because of totty
I did a Tati made me buy it video
including what she did that
collaboration with Birchbox on those was
loc products yeah loc and I talked about
this brush this is a really fun brush
you can go like this you can go like
this you can go like this you can do all
kinds of fun stuff it's just a fun brush
I'm definitely keeping that one okay so
now onto the ones that I really really
like ooh this one another very famous
elf brush the elf blush brush this is
the other one if you do not own this by
elf I definitely recommend
picking it up I love the pointy shape
it's very high quality for such an
inexpensive brush it's wonderful I love
that the bristles go all the way down I
really prefer that in a blush brush
because it picks up a lot of product and
it's fluffy so it blends it out really
nicely so yes on the elf blush brush
these are all ones that I really like
I'm probably going to get rid of this
Moda brush just because it's a short
brush and it gets lost and it's annoying
it says it's a powder brush I think it
came in a set but I don't I wouldn't use
this for powder I would use this for
blush because it's too small for powder
for me so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter that one these are all
wonderful I love all of these so this
one is the it cosmetics bye Jamie Curran
innovative technology cosmetics and it
just says c3 175 oh no there's no other
name on it but it's a really nice blush
brush I really like it a lot this one is
a little bit more dense Allison says I
want that blush brush emily noel keeps
using from Estee Lauder it's shaped like
a C curve onto your cheek ooh that's
interesting
Helen says the Saharan blush palette is
still on HauteLook so I definitely
recommend GG's place I love that brand
ok these right here are some of my
favorite blush brushes actually this is
really nice for highlighter - this is
the luxe e tapered highlighter this was
actually more for highlighter because
it's too small for blush I feel like
well now I could probably get away with
it for blush but I really love these
domed ones with lots of bristles
sticking out very very nice this one is
by peach and Lily it's fabulous
yep no peach and pearl not peach and
Lillie peach and lily is a skincare
website it's Korean skincare but this is
a very nice brush as well definitely
keeping that this is the elf one this is
weird
ok let me show you this what tabatha you
band Nadine what happens we'll have to
talk later what happened with Nadine
Thank You Mady you unbanned Nadine whoo
that scared me I hope she comes back oh
my gosh
Nadine has been a subscriber of mine for
a long time you about gave me a heart
attack what happened with Nadine hmm oh
my gosh that scare me for a second it's
sorry and I know that people have been
subscribing for a long
I'm like I know all of them like okay
all right we're good hopefully she comes
back oh my gosh I'm glad you fixed it
Tabitha oh good
sorry Nadine we were just talking about
you it was an accident she didn't mean
to it was totally an accident Nadine so
so sorry she just came back with a bunch
of question marks total accident
I wasn't I'm so sorry that that happened
but I'm glad you're back okay so this
elf brush you didn't miss anything
though okay so this elf blush brush is
really weird
if you I'm not sure if you can see that
but there are these little tiny bristles
that stick up I don't really see any
purpose to those I don't really see any
difference with those but I really like
this blush brush a lot hi Arwen how are
you okay Nadine is fine she says okay no
biggie
who I was afraid you were going to be
mad I'm glad you're okay
but anyway I really like this elf blush
I'm blush brush I'm keeping it these two
are also really nice this is a Mona
metallics blush brush and then this is
the whirling langnickel blush brush
again I really like the fluffier ones
and I like the ones that taper down
those are my favorite that's what I look
for in a blush brush that's what I like
okay so those are going in here now
let's go into the artiste style brushes
that I have we love Nadine welcome back
Helens Helen thank you okay there we go
they're talking you're talking to each
other never mind mary says HSN had our
tease for a great price that's wonderful
to keep an eye out for that very good
Catherine says I need to do what Jen
loves made me buy it oh I've been fun I
would like to watch that I think that'd
be fun okay so speaking of artiste this
is an actual artiste brush this is a
zero seven brush Nancy got me my artiste
brushes which was so kind of her this I
love I love this brush it is fabulous
and easy you wash it's a caked up mess
right now but I love this brush I did a
review comparing the artiste brushes to
the makeup revolution ones the makeup
revolution ones I'll give you a quick
summary but you can get into the whole
thing over on that video the makeup
revolution ones are definitely more
cheaply made I was trying to bend them
the way that I bet my artiste brush and
I snapped my makeup revolution one I
have heard that some people have snapped
their artiste brushes so definitely be
careful with those as well I do still
use these
like these but but they're definitely
not as good as the RTS what I do feel is
much closer in quality to the RTS is the
Mota ones the the prismatic one fees are
fabulous you can get them at Walmart I
think it's about 20 bucks for the set
and they're really really really nice
they're fantastic they're a little like
young-looking I know some people are
really getting tired of the unicorn
trend feeling like you know packaging is
you know treating us like we're children
all those kinds of things that's kind of
the way these are they're I mean I feel
like they're gorgeous I don't I don't
feel like it's treating me like a child
but I can definitely see the that point
of view but I do really really like
these I hope they make these in
different styles maybe more luxe mature
kinds of style on them on the body of it
but they're fantastic if you can get
your hands on them they're wonderful I
think they're more easy they're more
easy they're easier to get now than they
were when they first came out they were
always sold out when they first came out
they're wonderful these are this is the
Moto one and this is the makeup
revolution one I do like these I like
these for for concealer these are
perfect for concealer I use the the
medium-sized ones I've used these for
blush I've used these for concealer
every once in a while actually don't
prefer this size I prefer either this
size or that size because I like this
one for face and this one for under the
eyes I don't really like oh I don't
really like the small one these small
ones I'm not a huge fan of this one's
good for concealer though so I'm going
to keep the Artiste one this one here I
haven't got it I got ahold of how to
figure out how to use this one I'm going
to keep it because it is an artiste
brush but that's really the only reason
why I'm keeping it one thing I don't
like about this is look at all that
makeup right there you that's really
gross I've tried to use it for a liner
and it's just it's kind of hard to use
but I think if I practice more I get
good at it so I am going to get rid of
this little guy right here because I
don't really know what to do with them
but it's not as a bad brush I don't
really know I just don't know what to do
with it okay so now we are down to who
okay so I've got this here and these are
all bundled we only twenty minutes left
I didn't think I was going to take this
long I guess it's just so many brushes
to talk about okay let's do the
highlighter brushes and contour brushes
and then we'll go in
I brushes so these are fan brushes and
I've got three of them I'm going to keep
I'm going to keep these two this one
does work it's a crown the crown brush
one we got in boxycharm I believe but
I'm going to get rid of it Nancy says
brush your teeth with it Nikita says
does the high-end makeup you can get
sometimes at TJ Maxx and Marshalls legit
and seeing so many people finding things
there I believe that that stuff is legit
I believe that it is nose contour there
you go you could use it for nose contour
I don't contour my nose though it looks
stupid
it looks really stupid I've tried it
multiple times it looks horrible
Linda says go unicorns i like the
unicorn stuff but i can see why people
don't i can totally do good newberry
says yes use the contour small areas i
don't really it's too much for me i
don't do all that it's too much well let
will let the pros do that i'm not a pro
if you contour those small places i give
you mad props mad props to you because i
just don't have the patience and i don't
have the skill so mad props you if you
can do it heavily says you give away any
sin of my way i'm actually going to give
these to my I told my reporters and my
facebook admins that they're going to
get their pick of the stuff and then the
rest is going to be donated it's just
too much to send out and shipping is
insane alright so anyway these two fan
brushes I love this is a royal and
langnickel fan brush and the eve pro fan
brush definitely being kept I forgot to
put that in there okay and then these
are highlighter brushes I always said
that's because your nose is straight Jen
but my nose is bumpy I've got this big
because my mother is dumb Russian and
German Jew so she's they've got that
like Russian and German like that Jewish
nose with like the bump so I've got like
half of a bump because my dad is not
from there so I've got like this weird
thing people have asked me my whole life
if I've broken my nose and no I haven't
broken my nose sometimes people make
comments that my nose is huge and things
like that but you know I
it probably used some contouring if I
knew how to do what right but always
looks ridiculous so so anyway these are
my highlight brushes these two are very
very similar and I'm keeping both of
them this one is the beauty junkies Pro
highlighter this is the Sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 they're both fabulous
definitely being kept they're perfect
for applying highlighter because they're
they're tapered down to pick up a lot of
product but they they also blend out
very very nicely this is another really
good one this is the setting brush by by
Real Techniques but I use this mostly
for highlight I've also used it for
setting powder under the eyes both are
fantastic this is a really fun brush
this is the tarte brush that came in a
set and i love this one and it got lost
in my collection this is why i'm
decluttering because i love this brush
and i lost it it's really fun for
applying blush or for blending out
things that you already have on your
face so like once the contour is there
once the blush is there i kind of use
this to kind of mush them together a
little bit because it's super fluffy i
don't have anything like this it's
really fun and then these two are very
similar they're actually both by royal
and langnickel this is the metals and
then this is the the moto version and
they seem pretty much the same I'm going
to keep both of them because I like both
of them all right I think that's nope we
got one more thing of face brushes
OOP came a Tamar my little that was a
hair tie fail came out okay so these
okay I was reading comments okay so
these are like contouring brushes so
what you can do with these is you go
like this and you can put on your
contour and then I blend it out with
another brush so there's these this
one's really bendy though I don't really
like this one this is by royal and
langnickel this is the revolution BX 35
this one's too bendy it's I can't get
control of it it's like a wild dog on a
leash this thing so I'm going to get rid
of that one but I do really like both of
these this one is by peach and pearl and
it you know it's flat and then this
one's more rounded this is the elf one I
really like both of those those are both
getting kept okay any other face brushes
and we're going to move on to concealer
brushes so we're going big to small
okay here we go here are my concealer
brushes let's put these over here Donna
says I reverse contour my nose to make
it less noticeable I have a little bump
to reverse contouring your nose mmm our
one says Jen your nose is beautiful
thank you I've always hated my nose
always I look at my kids it's like how
did you get such cute noses when your
parents have bigger noses how did this
even happen hopefully they stay little
um okay is it anyway so this brush I
really don't like I had the receipt for
the longest time I meant to return it to
Ulta and they never did this is the Real
Techniques bold metals 102 this is their
concealer brush it's a triangle shape it
does not it's so stiff it doesn't blend
out the concealer it's really difficult
to use
I don't enjoy that one at all that's
getting passed along and then I've got
these babies here
whoo okay this one right here this one
I've used for setting powder under the
eye as well but it's really really stiff
so I've also used it for cream concealer
for blending and blending it out and I
like it because it's bigger so I'm
definitely going to keep that one oh
it's by tarte did i say that this is a
Tarte brush Katherine says that coffee
cup is tea Jen thank you it's my baby
this was his preschool picture
mama Shawna says it's so sad that
shipping has become so astronomically
expensive I didn't send I don't send to
my nieces and nephews as much so used to
only only at Christmas and even then I
try to send something directly from a
store shipping is outrageous it really
is okay so these right here so let's
talk about let's do these angled guys
okay I have two of these angled ones I
don't really prefer the angled style the
flat angled style I don't know I like
the round four under the eye because I
feel like if it fits better underneath
the eye if I didn't have round ones that
I so many round ones that I enjoyed I
would keep these but because I like the
round ones better and I have so many of
them I'm going to get rid of the flat
ones this is the mini flat brush by
beauty junkies this is the flat angled
brush by beauty junkies and then this is
by Coastal Scents
to declutter those and this one right
here this is a concealer brush by beau
gosh she's I think we got this in a boxy
charm or something um I think I'm
I'm going to declutter this one I'm
never going to reach for it never going
to reach for it okay these right here I
really like this one's fabulous oh my
gosh I love this one this is the Sephora
brand this is the pro press full
coverage precision brush it's number 67
oh my gosh this one is fabulous for
under-eye concealer it's super super
dense this is probably my favorite
under-eye concealer brush it's wonderful
Nancy said that one to me - Nancy sends
me all kinds of cool stuff this is by
outer beauty it's very similar it's just
more more tapered and I really love this
definitely keeping that that's the
tapered refiner by outer beauty I did
buy those by the way from outer beauty
those were not sent to me i buy those
when I've seen them at IMATS but they
were not IMATS this past year I was very
sad not to see them because I like them
a lot let's see these two are kind of
similar this is outer beauty and then
this is they're both outer beauty this
one's angled and this one's more rounded
but it's angled ends it's angled and it
has a curve to it so I like those a lot
kara says I'll check it out have it used
- for a brand daily cleaner oh you guys
talked about something else
I'm reading things making sure I'm not
missing anything Erica says I haven't
heard of outer beauty not many people
have I only discovered them because of I
Mads
and I told them when I said them I said
you have got to do more PR online like
you've got to send stuff to influencers
you've got to get yourself out there
because it's so good but they don't and
I don't know why because it's really
good stuff this brush right here is the
rail and langnickel triad concealer it's
very similar to the Real Techniques one
I don't like this style so I'm going to
declutter that one and then these all
right here on this one I actually I
think I'm going to get rid of this one I
don't know what brand this is where's
the label on it there's no label on this
one this one is too pointy it's it's
it's too much work too pointy I would
much rather have this kind of pointy for
under my eye than this kind of pointy
it's too I'm getting rid of that one
but I do like these these this is the
beauty junkies mini round brush and this
is the beauty junkies mini angled
rush I'm going to keep both of those so
these are going over here so these are
the ones in keeping for concealer
especially this one this one's awesome I
love how long the handle is too greeny
Barry says off topic what are we
drinking today I am drinking coffee from
my Keurig and I'm trying to it oh you
know what it is it's chocolate doughnut
flavored coffee with milk nothing else
because I have been cutting back on my
sugar intake I don't usually put sugar
in my coffee anyway but I've been
cutting back on my sugar okay so let's
go into I brushes we only have ten
minutes left in that do all these I
brushes oh my gosh we might have to take
a little bit longer today okay so these
right here this is a nice transition in
I brushes these are all flat brushes
that are really good for concealer or
they can be used with cream on shadows
or foiled eyeshadow so I'm going to keep
a small selection of these and I'm going
to declutter the rest this one is by
peach and pearl this one is pointed I
don't prefer this one because I find it
harder to control that the point is just
it's it's weird for me I think would be
good if I was using it for concealer but
because I'm trying to use it for eye
shadow excuse me it's not functional for
me so I'm gonna get rid of that one this
one is the cream shadow brush by unique
I love this brush this is a really
really good cream shadow brush so one of
the few things that I would definitely
recommend from unique are the brushes
the lip brush and this brush were
fabulous and I'm saying that from the
bottom of my heart I really like that
there isn't if you're going to a unique
party there's very much very few things
that I would recommend that you buy that
I think you would genuinely enjoy this
is one of them okay so this here is the
color pop brush this one I really like
as well for the for like for eyeshadows
and things so I'm going to keep this one
this one's the same thing but it's a
little larger I'm going to keep that one
because I like the way that it tapers
let's see this one's kind of pointy well
I don't know mm okay this is a lip brush
by royal and langnickel somehow the
snuck in there I'm going to keep this
because I've been really enjoying
putting on liquid lipstick with lip
sticks with lip brushes lately so I'm
go ahead and keep that one even though
that one doesn't really belong here
retractable brushes I don't really enjoy
retractable brushes just because I don't
end up reaching for them I like all my
brushes to be like sitting up so I can
see what they are and when they're
retracted I don't see them and I don't
pick them up
retractable brushes are the ones that
kind of sink in and then sometimes they
have a top that screws on their break
for travel though Donna says Tara babies
does reverse contour she knows she shows
it in her face making videos I will
definitely check that out I mostly check
out Torres videos for her eyeshadows I
love her eyeshadow videos okay okay I
make sure I'm not missing anything okay
and Erica says I'm scared of retractable
one sounds like a petri dish good point
here's another this nook in here too
this is another lip brush from the Moto
metallics I'm going to keep that this
one I don't really use much this is the
royal and langnickel concealer brush and
this one's going to have to be seriously
clean before I pass it on but I'm going
to get rid of that one this one is the J
cat beauty one it's very similar to this
one and because I don't use them that
much and this one short I'm going to get
rid of that the short ones I could never
find I lose them this is the Ulta I said
oh gosh really really nice um I love the
Ulta brushes but I don't think I'm going
to reach for this one because it's so
short so I'm going to get rid of that
one okay these two this one is by Ofra
and this one is by Tarte I'm going to
keep both of them and that I feel like
that's too many though do I really need
that many get the lip brushes out of
there yeah well it's five of them do I
need all five I don't need all five I
don't know this one's smaller though so
therefore they do the same size and one
this one it's slightly different I'm
giving up I'm giving them okay next up
okay we've got we've got a lot left here
okay this is my these are my weird tools
will do my weird tools next these guys
right here I have these dual sided
sponge applicators I have a few of those
I actually really like these these are
really nice especially for more cream
like more than like the moist eyeshadows
these are really nice for those I'm
keeping those I'm getting more into
using sponge applicators and then a
spoolie brush this one is by Wayne Goss
I believe in both of these are by Wayne
Goss it was from the beauty lush lucky
bag so yes keeping those okay let's do
these guys right here I don't need all
of these ok these are like round
eyeshadow brushes that I when I use them
for is kind of packing color into the
outer corner and then I blend it up with
a fluffy brush but how many of those do
I really need like five at the most at
the most this one I don't like this is
by royal and langnickel this is the
revolution BX 95 I think we got these in
boxycharm as well it's too skinny I
don't like it I prefer my pencil brushes
that are smaller for this I don't know
it's kind of Scratchy
I don't know there's just something that
rubs me the wrong way with this brush I
don't like it oh this one's in the wrong
one that's supposed to be with those
this one's a fun one this one's really
pointy this one is by this is the rock
and roll brush by bareMinerals it's got
a little C brush on one side and a
pointy brush on the other side I don't
reach for it often but it's it's fun I
don't know
I'm never going to use this thing what
am I talking about because it's it's -
it's really pointy it's really really
really pointy I don't know if I ever get
into eye art or something maybe I'll use
it I'll keep it because I know I'm going
to regret it if I get rid of it okay
which ones are similar
here's pencil brushes let's get the
pencil brushes I think these are all the
pencil brushes I think hopefully okay
inside two of them well no I have more
than this I think they got separated
somehow alright but anyway okay let's do
these instead these round ones these big
round e's i don't need all of these
these like I was saying that uses a pack
right here and then I blend it out with
another brush I'm going to keep this one
right here the Real Techniques one this
is the 201 I really like that one and
I'm going to key
eeep I'm going to get rid of this one

on it I don't know I'm going to get rid
of it though

is an Ulta brand crease brush this one's
really nice because you can get it like
right in here Mary is leaving bye Mary
I do not have any mug foundation brushes
the makeup geek ones I don't I'm going
to keep this one because this one's a
little more pointy like so it can get in
there a little bit better and then this
one there's a real techniques in the
world and langnickel I'm just going to
keep both of those because it's just two
of that no it's not - because I kept the
other ones I use them both I like them

what I use these for is once I get that
color in the outer corner I use these to
blend it up in the crease I also use
these for transition colors and I also
use these for
when I have two completely different
colors or two colors are similar doesn't
really matter next to each other on my
lid I'll use this to kind of gently
blend the colors together this is by Pat
McGrath labs this came with their new
super new set I love love love this

that one Oh see I feel like I can use
for these fluffy guys I don't feel like
I want to get rid of any of these this
one here is by I don't have many from
this brand this is by SL miss glam this
is a youtuber one look how beautiful
that brush is I've heard some people say
that their brushes from this brand fell
apart I had no problems with mine this
one's by royal and langnickel this one
is the Sigma e-40 and this one is the
beauty junkies Pro tapered blending and
you can see these two or almost like
well the beauty junkies one is a little
bit wider but they're they do pretty
much the exact same thing I'm keeping
them I love them all I'm keeping them
okay let's go for the thinner ones they
look almost the same can you imagine if
I didn't organize these last night what
mess we would have been in so glad I did
that okay I've got these four they look
up five they look almost the same which
one's the shortest the short ones get
lost the it cosmetics one is the
shortest I don't know I like them all I
don't need I'm going to get rid of the
it cosmetics one they all do the same
thing this is the pro crease by beauty
junkies this is the luxe E 205 this is
peach and pearl and this one is everyday

these are all smaller versions this one
is the Luxy 229 and this is the Luxy 231
they look almost the same I don't need
them both I'm going to get rid of this
one and then this one's really fun it's
kind of like that tart brush but it's
very small the one that I was talking
about earlier that I used for a blush
but it's really nice it's very fun to
just really detailed blending and this
is the Anastasio one that came with the

the tart these are all flat shader brush
--is so these are all I use these for
packing color onto my lid okay this one
I'm going to get rid of this is the it
cosmetics brushes for Ulta brush it's
very very thick and I have a lot of
trouble using this brush because the
taper doesn't go down very far and it's
very thick so I have lots of problem
with that one I'm going to get rid of
that one okay that's one I'm definitely
keeping this one the taper goes down
further and that's why I like this one
this is the Real Techniques bold metals
200 brush this is definitely getting
capped ooh I cleaned out my cup I can

large comes in there i brush set i'm
going to get rid of that one
this is another one that I don't ever
use this is a V Ramona brush it's just a
little tiny C brush I have small ones
that I really like better than this so
I'm going to get rid of that one
speaking of small brushes I really like
this is by Coastal Scents just a little
one it's really nice for just small
detailing like that one a lot here's
another one that I like a lot this is
the world like royal and langnickel
smudger
make sure I'm not missing anything
Banshee Muse says my sister has hooded
eyes and I got her smaller brushes and
it makes it easier to do eye shadow I
have heard that it's a lot easier with
more detailed brushes more with smaller
brushes like little C brushes and things
this is a Coastal Scents little C brush
how many of these do I need I have a
bunch of these I'm going to get rid of
this one I don't need that one I'm going
to keep this one though this is the
royal and langnickel oh this came with
that little set the the omnia brushes

that and then this one here I have so
much trouble with this is the Eco tools
one it's a C brush but it's like bent
they're very difficult to use I don't
like it at all this side I do like but
I'm going to just go ahead and pass that
whole thing along okay this one here is
a short one this is I don't know what
brand this is oh this is chart C now I
say it start see this is this is the
mental thing I've got going on here it
says it starts oh and I'm like oh maybe
I should keep it because its chart I'm
never going to use this brush passing it
along stop falling for it Jen okay
