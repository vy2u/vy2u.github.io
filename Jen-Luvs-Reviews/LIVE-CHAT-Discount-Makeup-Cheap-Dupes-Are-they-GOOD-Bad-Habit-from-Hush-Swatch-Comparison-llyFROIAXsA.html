the what's up and makeup weekly chat I'm
so excited for today I'm so excited for
today because we have some potential
very inexpensive dupes for high-end
products I'm kind of torn on how I feel
about inexpensive dupes in that you know
competition is good in the market but
when you take something that someone
else is created and you copy the exact
same thing and you make it cheaper like
I don't know in a way in my mind it's
kind of cruddy but at the same time it's
like you know I don't know I almost I
almost see that it's not cruddy you know
because it's just business but at the
same time it's a little cruddy that
someone need I don't know I'm like I'm
kind of torn I'd be curious to know what
you think down in the comments below or
if you're here in live chat what you
think of dupes now makeup revolution has
kind of had the market on inexpensive
dupes for a while but there's a new
brand in town and it's called bad habit
and you can buy it on website called
shop hush now hush contacted me and they
asked me if I wanted to become a shop
hush affiliate which means that I would
earn a percentage of sales on anything
that any of you all bought on the
website and you know I like I said
mention the video recently like I'm not
opposed to earning extra money but at
the same time I'm not going to
compromise my integrity or my
relationship with you over getting money
so I'm still going to be honest with you
no matter what but I do wanna let you
know there is a discount code down below
it's Jen love je and lu v and all caps
it'll get you 10% off the website and
also earns me a commission but that
being said you know i'm me and nothing
is ever gonna change that because then i
end up like everybody else and i'm not
special
not everybody else but you know what I'm
trying to say I'm not special if I if I
turn the corner on that you know and I
want to be special and be the person you
can count on there are other people you
can count on on YouTube I'm not trying
to say that but you know I don't want to
be like that so just so you know that's
that's what's going down and I'm
breaking it down right now in the
beginning of the video to make sure that
you guys
I'm being 100% transparent about it and
you can decide what you want to do and
you don't have to use my code if you
don't want to you can just go over there
and buy stuff is cheap enough as it is
you don't really have to use the 10% off
it's still kind of inexpensive anyway I
do have the prices oh the price sheet is
over here along with my coffee let me
grab that real quick and then we'll say
hello to the collective brain of makeup
often in just a second
because I left my coffee and I left my
price sheet even though I think they're
all $10 we have 9 different palettes
here 9 different things to show you and
I have the high-end products for three
of them legit and then one I have there
these highlight palettes that are very
similar to the Anasazi Beverly Hills one
so I'm going to show you my Glo kit
which is different than these I think
these match up with different Anasazi
Oklo kits but I don't have that but I do
have the naked heat palette I have the
oh no it's four it's four of them it's
the subculture palette
the Anasazi on Modern Renaissance called
the Anasazi subculture palette the
two-faced tea peach palette and then the
Urban Decay Naked heat palette those are
the ones we're gonna be focusing on
today and then I'm gonna show you the
highlight palette from honest and kind
of compare that but there's also two
other Anasazi they really nailed on all
Nastasia there's the unicorn glow
palette which is like the Anasazi oh I
forgot what it's called one of their
highlight kits I can't remember off the
top of my head and then this one's
supposed to be like the Nicole Guerrero
one I believe and then this here is
supposed to like the hood of beauty one
so we have those as well that we can dip
into I also brought out my stuff that
was sent to me from profusion if you
guys are curious about that stuff
because that stuff is also really
inexpensive
I've only opened two of the things from
profusion they look like this they did
send me their whole holiday collection
if you're curious about any of this we
can talk about that maybe toward the end
of the video if you're interested but
we're going to mostly be spoke focus is
focusing really mostly focusing on these
stuff from shop hush
it's hush hush calm and yeah I think
there are all 10 dollars for each one
yeah everything's 10 bucks I don't even
know why I need this because they're all
10 bucks all right let's go ahead and go
ahead and say hello to the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness those the
people that are here in live chat if you
were here on the replay and you don't
enjoy a live chat format I do apologize
I've been doing
for like three or four years and I love
connecting with community this way if
you don't like it I'm sorry I do plan on
doing actual reviews on these products
with like next to each other comparisons
like super thorough like I normally do
but I just want to give you a quick
rundown and kind of get a feel for what
you want to see and that way I know what
to focus on for the channel so we're
gonna kind of work together on that so
let me go ahead and say hello to the
people that were here first I did have
to exit out so the first couple of
people that were here I'm sorry I had to
exit out because my internet connection
crapped out on me so I missed the first
couple people so it's starting here for
me with Amber and a pure soul good
morning to you she got an extra hour
asleep she's excited I'm excited about
that too Abbie is here from London hello
to Stephanie and Jennifer good morning
she says first time she's early the live
chat so happy to have you here the
fabulous Tabitha here she is
representing the wrench wenches they are
assembling it is there are moderators
for chat we have quite a few of them to
make sure we have a nice peaceful chat
situation so Thank You tabatha for being
here
cheyenne is here good morning latina is
here with Julio down by the schoolyard
hello how are you
says so many here already hi everyone
almost a hundred thousand yes you know I
once I hit a hundred thousand
subscribers I don't even know like
because all I want is the play button
it's not about the number I just want
the stupid play button to hang on the
wall I know exactly where I'm putting it
and I'm excited about my play button
that's all so the next play button I
think is in a million I you know it took
me five years to get to a hundred
thousand died I think a million is kind
of far off so I'm just happy get to a
hundred thousand then we'll just hang
out there for a little while so yeah
we're almost there
we're almost there should have a big
party megan is here representing the
wrench wenches good morning to you
Meghan Karen is here and then Tim and
Lamoni Akita and Alexandra and Karen are
here she says I actually love that
palette definitely a learning curve I'm
not sure which palette she's talking
about oh the subculture because I said I
was having trouble I came on a little
bit late so I was having trouble finding
my subculture palette but I found it it
was just buried I have back here this is
where I keep kind of my excess of
palettes back here the ones that I love
but I can't keep out because I just
don't have enough room
for them so it was just buried in the
back of there but anyway all right let's
go ahead and get into this and hello to
everybody I didn't say hello to good
morning to you all right whoo Mary says
you should have three million subs thank
you so much I appreciate it well you
know you vote with your views you know
and that's what I've been telling people
lately you know whatever you know
whoever whoever you want to succeed
that's who you watch and you know you
vote with your views it's like you know
when you go to shop at a store you spend
your money where you want to spend your
money who you want to support it's the
same exact thing people are saying my
Supernatural shirt I know I've told you
I'm gonna talk about makeup I'm sorry
supernaturals back on the air and I am
so loving it I heard this is the last
season and I'm gonna cry but I had to
represent my voice today so all right
anyway let's go ahead and start with
this one let's start with the Royals
palette I have worn this on my eyes one
time and I was actually quite impressed
with it so this is the one from bad
habit and then this is the one from
honest Asya and as you can see it's not
in the exact same order but I figured we
could swatch them in similar orders like
for example this shade Vermeer it's
obviously Queen as this one for that and
then we've got tempera which is Treasury
and then Primrose which is bon fresco so
I figured we could just do some finger
swatches I did invest in some Mac
brushes I pay $50 for these two things
and then someone told me that they're
discontinuing all their Mac brushes I
can't tell you how mad I was because
they're going on 100% vegan on their
brushes I don't even know if these are
animal I just looked at the numbers and
I got them I didn't even look to see if
they were Amway or like because people
told me you have to get the 242 in the
239 that's what's that Nina Cole yes
that's what you need and I can say that
now that I can consider Stephanie a
friend of mine I can like that's what
Stephanie Nicole yes I'm just kidding
but anyway yeah so I invested in these
because really Bev her they are the best
brushes and that's why Stephanie uses
them I also read up tonight Mac Paint
Pot in painterly so I figured we might
do an eye look today and try to kind of
create the same look if we have some
time so I'm gonna go ahead and swatch so
we're gonna do the first watch is going
to be from
the the the bad habit and then we'll do
no we'll do the first watch from from
the from the real palate and then we'll
do the second swatch from bad habit so
we'll do Vermeer and Queen and it looks
like Queen is definitely patchy err on
the fingers let's put it here and it's
definitely not not as pigmented it's
definitely different and like I said I'm
gonna do a full video on this Treasury
and tempura oops I did it backwards darn
hold on a minute let me get my towel
because I can tell me to mess this up
first one is the real one Jen okay I
shouldn't say real one like the other
ones not real but okay tempura Treasury
okay bread Oh says I paid forty four
dollars for one brush you are dedicated
okay so these are not duped so far but
what I could tell you from using them
once is that I did create a look that
was very nice with these they definitely
don't feel the same me on estancia one
feels softer so again this is the abh
bad habit ADH bad habit ADH bad habit
hopefully you can see cuz I can't see
myself there's a there's a what you call
it a delay on it
karen says len and asbestos lead and
asbestos these are not okay so as far as
hush goes and bad habit they are not one
of those sellers that's like deep deep
down in China like in the depths of the
pools of you know they are like I don't
know if there are we're gonna say I
don't know if they are Matt what is it
mass-produced yeah that's what I said
first ones high-end yeah this one is gen
that's what I said baby I don't know if
they're like mass-produced what is it um
my brain is not functioning today when
when you I don't know but anyway yeah I
think you know I'm saying like where
they're like mass-produced and they're
just picked the shadows or whatever and
they're you know the formula sold
everywhere I think that this is like a
legit brands like
let me go to their website shop hush and
I'm gonna do all this research and stuff
before when I do the like real videos
this is just a you know kind of a an
intro to it let me see if they haven't
about us just cuz it's cheap doesn't
mean that it's like lead and asbestos
you know what I mean
cuz we did talk about and what that and
what's up and make up today about the
cheap dupes on from eBay where they did
have that kind of stuff in it
let me see I'm looking at their do you
offer cruelty free brands yes we
continuously bring in more cruelty free
brands for you below is a list of our
current cruelty free brands and bad
habit is one of those cruelty free
brands and it doesn't have any other
information that I think would be good
is there like an about Us section mmm I
don't see anything as far as like an
about us but it like the way that that
that they contacted me was super Pro you
know it did they didn't seem shady at
all so I don't think these are like the
lead and asbestos kinds of pallets
that's that's my impression Britto says
his Vizier at the same brand with a BH
no they're not the same brand they're
very different because from well from
hanging out with Stephanie she knows the
people over at visi art she's talked to
me a lot about that okay Megan says
mass-produced where they only pick the
shades like morphe yes exactly exactly
yes like Murphy okay let's keep going
with this okay
antique bronze I can't figure out which
ones antique broads okay
honor so the first one antique bronze
and then honor so the first one is the a
BH and the second one is bad habit and
there's definitely a pigmentation
difference there's definitely a
pigmentation but the shades are pretty
close on that one
let's see a love-letter is the red and
then majestic is the one from the shop
hush won the bad habit one
you can definitely see a pigmentation
difference there you see this is the a
BH and this is the bad habit and of
course these are brushed watches they
perform differently on the eye we all
know this but I feel like I have to say
it now Cyprus umber is a really really
pigmented soft shade those are those two
on the fingers and you can see
immediately the difference in quality
there as far as the pigmentation goes
very very different okay so that's the
first row again this is a BH bad habit a
th bad habit a BH bad habit a th bad
have it ADH bad habit a BH bad habit so
you can really see there is quite a
difference let's do the white chest okay
it looks like the first ones are gone a
BH is hanging in there better a BH is
hanging in there better for all of them
but the shop hush ones from the with
that bon fresco 1 2 3 4
yeah from bon fresco over the dupes for
bomb fresco and over those are the ones
that hang in there pretty well Steph
says bad habit palettes are cruelty free
that's what they say on the website yes
they do so that's a good thing
alright let me get mine this is a dr.
jart my solar water I got a little
sample of it it's been very handy in
here normally when I do this I actually
wash my arm but because I don't want to
get up and wash my arm we're just gonna
go straight over it oh there's a little
bit of glitter on here mmm my towel hmm
yeah I knew what I always have backups
so we'll do a new one ok line says lots
of things produced in China with boof
controls not quite sure what you mean by
that meaning that they are not
controlled well I would imagine that's
probably true a BH is 40 bad habit is 10
so yes that's true
don't said that wipe test yes I did the
weight test iris yes yes okay let's move
on to the next row so we've got raw
Sienna and that is with noble from bad
habit so that's those together on the
finger
and then Jamie says you get what you pay
for well that's what we're trying to
figure out do you is it really you get
what you pay for because is that always
true again we've got more pigmentation
with the abh but like I said I did use
these on my eyes and I did create pretty
looks was it the same quality no it
wasn't but you could still create
similar look so it's really what you're
what you're looking for and some people
just don't have forty dollars to spend
on on eyeshadow so I mean there's
definitely a quality difference there Oh
AJ says I think she meant good not goof
well now let me go back up and see what
she had said cuz I missed it I need I
can't find it anymore I lost it oh there
go there a lot lots of things are
produced in China with good controls I
don't know that for a fact but possibly
hygen does hush okay here we go
ELISA says hi Jen does Haas your bad
habit website lists the ingredients
online I don't know actually let me look
and see let me click on one of the
palettes and I will tell you I do have
the ingredients on the box as I saved
all of the boxes me I'm gonna look at
the face candy palette that's the one
that's the peach one and no ingredients
are not online but when I do the video I
will show you the ingredients actually I
can get the boxes and I can show you
real quick after we finished watching
this because I'm taking forever to
swatch this one palette I'm sorry if
you're watching this on the replay I'm
sorry alright let's just rock through
these without me getting distracted too
much more okay so we've got one oh now
on a minute
then we got Primavera and then queen
the tones are completely different on
those where Primavera is peachy err okay
and then we'll do red ochre and rain rei
GN there's definitely I mean it's not
even close not even close T I can't I
can't pronounce that I'm sorry sleek is
great and Vanessa Leu says true
wet-and-wild is awesome and cheap got
good points there got good points let's
go for it Venetian red and majestic oh
wait or is that love letter oh you know
what they don't they have to hmm okay so
it looks like they've added some sparkle
to the Venetian red one where Venetian
red has some as matte regal has some
shimmer in it but we'll swatch it next
to it anyway
and I have some glitter on my arm now
because of that stupid towel and then
we've got warm taupe and throne I guess
I feel like I'm running out of room here
did I do something twice Mon says PRC
yes whenever you say see PRC that is the
same alright we've got real gar and
monarch an indefinite pigmentation
difference there so this is the second
row
again this is a BH bad habit a BH bad
habit a BH bad habit a BH by having a pH
vet have it a BH bad habit AVH a bad
habit so we're definitely seeing a
significant difference let's go ahead
and wipe these babies off and see what
happens okay so we definitely have some
staying power it looks like this one the
dupe for throne it looks like is that oh
no for a warm taupe that one did not
stay from bad habit and then this one
here did not stay from bad habit so I
mean from from right here from just the
swatches without throwing in the fact
that I have used this palette once I
would say that the quality on a BH is
way better but from using it on my eyes
I was happy with it I will tell you that
it did fade faster it did the it did
money together faster even with primer
so there is a quality difference but if
you're on a budget you can probably
create very similar looks with this and
I think they did a good job with the
shades overall but yeah it's not the
same not the same but similar very very
similar alright let's go ahead and put
this one down for a second I don't think
I'm gonna go through each one of those
like that because like for example this
one is I mean that's a lot of shades but
I'll show you how it looks next to it
okay we'll do a few shades from each one
so that is the peach palette and then
the sugar palette and I'll tell you that
the packaging feels very similar I would
say that the sugar one is a little
lighter the magnetic closure is just a
straw
which is not very strong but it doesn't
open up if you shake it but they really
aren't super strong magnetic closures
they're about the same there but will
swatch a couple of them just to compare
Ashley says color pop has a lot of
amazing similar colors to higher and
shadows yes they do does a sugar want to
smell that is a great question let me
close up the peach and get that out of
my nose because I can smell that no well
it smells like makeup a little bit just
a little bit though it's not like
offensive or anything it's not a bad bad
smell okay let's do a couple of them I'm
really curious about this one right here
which is talk derby to me I'm curious
about this blueberry pie how that's
going to compare I haven't swatch this
one at all yeah so this is two-faced and
then this is bad habit but you can
probably pack that on let me see if I
can pack it on oh my gosh I wiped it off
my fingers look at the difference this
was the two face and this was the bad
habit the bad habit is gone alright
let's go with this finger into blueberry
pie again and see if I can build it I
mean I can probably build it up to the
same thing the undertones are the same
the glitter is the same so I think we're
coming to a good conclusion here about
these things that they can be used for
the same purpose but they're not the
same quality alright I want to do the
bless her heart which is the green shade
from Too Faced and then go into
pistachio see that looks really good
that one's really good that one looks
close as far as that Taylor says I'd be
interested in the subculture dupe if
it's decent enough yeah we're gonna go
into that in a second I'm just gonna do
like maybe three more of these swatches
let's do I really like Georgia from this
and then we'll do their creme sugar and
spice is what it's called see those are
they're not the same shade but the one
from from hush doesn't look like as bad
a quality as some of the other ones from
home
Shh okay sherry says I'm interested in
that lime-green shape from subculture
yeah we're gonna go over that and I did
use the subculture dupe once so we'll go
over that
let me see let's do one more let's do
let's do one of the Matt's let's do the
white peach which is the Matt cream
shade and then whipped cream and my
finger stained a little bit
Rose wants to know if the sugar palate
smells no it doesn't well it smells a
little bit like makeup that's actually
not a bad matte cream shade from hush or
from bad habit that's not a bad shade
one two three four let's do one more
Matt let's do this let's do candied
peach which is an interesting one it's
one of those mats with this with the
glitter in the background or like a
little bit of glitter and their shade
candy they look like that I don't know
that's pretty stinking close as far as
the glitter and then I mean they're
different they're not the same but
that's pretty good there's definitely
some glitter in the one from Hache and
they're they're slightly different in
tone but well no that's pretty that'd be
a pretty look those colors they're that
antique pink green kind of look that'd
be really pretty
alright let's wipe them off and see what
happens okay so it looks like again the
hashas lasting a little bit less but
it's not terrible I've seen worse I've
definitely seen worse Kristen wants to
know if I want to do a video about the
vib sale probably not just because I
don't have time before it ends I have my
video we Stephanie Nicole going live
tomorrow that I'm super excited for you
guys to see she has one on her channel
as well and then I have my subculture
video I'm working on this week and I
forget what the other oh and then I've
got my fabfitfun video for this week so
I don't think that I'm gonna be doing a
vib sale one but you can look at I did
recently do videos on Sephora and Ulta
best products and worst products and
what I think of the highest rated and
lowest rated products at Ulta and so
forth so you can check that out for
information it's kind of similar but I'm
not gonna do one dedicated specifically
to the sale just because I don't have
time to do it
okay let's since everybody seems to be
very curious about the sub
culture deep let's go into that one next
where's the palate what did I do with it
it's over it's on the bottom here so
their palate is called retro love and it
looks like this and this is them next to
each other they look like this and again
we've got them reorganized people are
saying something about People's Republic
of China PRC when they say made in the
PRC that is People's Republic of China
this does say made in PRC designed in
Los Angeles made in PRC cruelty-free
products so you also have to remember
there are lots of brands like Julia's
place is made in China so this this it's
the same exact it seems to be the same
exact situation where it's created in
the United States and then made in China
just like Julia's place in juvy this
place is amazing quality so I wouldn't
judge it based on just that it's made in
China because there are some good
products that are made in China where I
says I love Stephanie Nicole best cloud
ever retro love is awesome okay well
let's get into it now I did wear this on
my eyes once and I found that the
psychedelic shading here
I actually liked better than cube but it
faded faster than cube let me show you
so I'll put cube and then psychedelic
here so don't drop them cube psychedelic
see how psychedelic is lighter it's
easier to see on the eyes and you can
really see the pink shift in the one
from bad habit you can see the pink
shift a lot easier than you can see the
one from ABH so actually really liked
that a lot hi Emmy how are you
[Laughter]
Karen says the Vivi Nicole Concilio
palette is awesome great coach
I like violet boss as a brand very much
alright let's do a lectric and icon so
Electric is here from ABH and icon is
here
and that was one of the weaker shades
for me in the subculture palette and I
feel like they really nailed it I don't
know how they did weave bad habit but I
think they really nailed it and actually
like the pigmentation here from the
swatch better I haven't worn this on my
eyes yet let's do adorn which is the
coppery oil kind of shade and revolution
these actually feel kind of similar but
you can see the texture is different on
my fingers but they're both I mean look
at that
it's crazy man it's crazy Gigi says oMG
hi Janis is my first time catching a
live stream so happy to have you here
and ash says Kalkan the makers do this
and get a weight get by with it cuz it's
not illegal it's not illegal if they
called it a subculture palette then it
would be illegal but because they're not
calling it subculture it's not illegal
it's a cruddy some people would argue
that it's definitely cruddy Florence
says China requires all makeup sold in
China be tested on animals that's true
but if they don't sell in China it can
be cruelty free so that's what I would
imagine the situation is okay let's go
into some of these mats let's do the
light green because I think there was a
request for the light green so destiny
is the abh light green and then hippy is
the one from bad habit well it's kind of
like a dustier green it's kind of
chunked up on my arm a little bit same
thing where it's not quite as pigmented
but we've got a really nice similar
shade there mary says no only if it's
sold in China that's the only reason
they have for animal testing it's made
in China and not sold no animal testing
right because they have a law that you
have to test it on animals in China all
right let's do New Wave which is the
orange and fab okay
so I'm reading Mary says nothing in
makeup isn't a Ridge is original nothing
but very little I would say is original
so same thing where we've got more
pigmentation with the abh okay and then
let's do let's do one more
let's do fudge because people were
complaining about fudge in subculture
and then the shade that matches is youth
I mean youth is definitely patchy er so
we've got more pigmentation but chances
are we're looking at a little bit easier
to use maybe the one from hush the the
bad habit one because the big problem
with subculture was that the pigment was
so so so strong that it was a little bit
hard to blend out where this may be a
little bit easier to blend out and the
shades are really really similar at
least these ones that i've swatched
again we're going to we're gonna do full
videos on this I saw someone say
something about China hat uses bad
ingredients not always though not always
you can't I mean this is the thing I
think is people we tend to generalize
and we we say you know just because this
is from this country it's gonna be like
this just because it's just because it's
this you know it looks like this it's
gonna be like this we have to take each
brand as an individual brand you know
what I mean you can't judge just based
on one factor each brand has their own
set of ethics the problem is is that a
lot of brands are not transparent about
things being bad so you don't know
whether it's good or bad but what I'm
comparing this to as far as
manufacturing is Junius place in that it
is made in People's Republic of China
but it is cruelty free so to me and and
it's it's designed in the United States
so they're shipping out to China for
production that the lab is in China but
that doesn't necessarily mean there's
bad stuff and I would be very curious to
have someone analyze the the quality
like in a lab that's the only way we're
gonna find out
these true the true ingredients and true
quality of these things is if a lab does
it but you can't judge it just because
it's made in China because you just
can't it's not there cuz not everything
in China is is laced with horrible
things you know what I mean where I
wouldn't trust is the companies that are
shipping things in bags that say
clothing and they're five dollars and
you get them off eBay I would not trust
those that I would not trust Jean says
where can we find that habit it's on
shop hush comm is the brand hush not
Tosha to know and a palates named bad
habit of I don't know hon I don't know
is there a Natasha I don't a palate name
bad habit I don't know of that
okay all right
Valli says nice shirt hi my supernatural
friend alright let's wipe these off and
we've got about the same staying power
almost we've got a little less here with
the dupe for New Wave a little less here
with the dupe for for um destiny but
overall I mean it's the same thing it's
the same thing they're being very
consistent in their just a little bit
not as good just a little bit not as
good alright
what time is it okay we're a bit moving
on 32 minutes and I've got lots more
show you we're not getting to the
perfusion stuff there's just no way okay
I do want to swatch something from each
of these so let's just let's go into the
naked heat one real quick and put these
down here so they're out of my way okay
so naked heat has I believe twelve
shades one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve I don't
want to misspeak has twelve shades but
this one here the inferno oh this one
has twelve - okay it's just set the set
up differently so let's put them next to
each other there you go and we
definitely have some new penis going on
definitely some do penis okay let's
start with the mats this time okay
bounce
I do have full reviews on all these by
the way I have full reviews on
subculture I have sweet pea out on all
of these well mom
Renaissance I did a comparison with
another palette to the sweet peach I've
a comparison with the other smelly
palettes my smelly eyelets smacked down
I have a full review on the subculture
of a full review on the naked heat if
you're curious about those just search
for Jenn Lowe's reviews and that I'll
try to remember to put it in the
description after chat ends okay Mallory
didn't get notification oh all right
this is ounce and white hot I look
pretty similar the one from bad habit is
a little brighter
let's do low blow and warmth
sometimes I'm forgetting to show you the
swatches on my fingers up here Angie
says Jenna I've been looking at the
instant eye palette from Charlotte
Tilbury and I noticed that the Milani
I've how it's very similar has anyone
noticed I have not noticed that but
that's very interesting okay same thing
where we're getting less pigmentation
but same shame shame shame all right
let's do lumber let me see I can't
figure out which ones are the dupes it
looks so similar that was one of my big
complaints about the naked heat was that
the shades were so similar inside so I'm
having the same issue here okay let's do
dirty talk in a blaze that one looks
like that's what's meant it's Annie the
dupe there I mean they're definitely
different and like looking at from this
angle the one from Urban Decay is
definitely a darker color than this one
but on the eye I don't know if you're
gonna be able to tell the difference I
don't know hi Stephanie Stephanie says
hi Stephanie Davis Schaffer a flame
thrower Jenn what do you think of the
new hood and mini palettes I bought one
I'll have to see it's on the way think I
think it's great that she did smaller
palettes that were less expensive
let's do n Fuego and burn let me get a
little more burn on my finger yeah it's
it looks like it's gonna be patchy no
that's not so bad it's a little chunkier
but
and then for the last one we'll do em
per ember which is the last one and
ignite there's those okay they're
different um that I like I like the
Urban Decay one better just because I
like the undertones of it I like the
shine of like a pink undertone
underneath that one where this one's
more grey but it's close its close it's
not so bad
so yeah close all right let's wipe it
off don't pretty close again we're
having that same thing where the one
from hush is just it's not quite hanging
in there as long if you're new to my
channel the wipe test the purpose of it
is to show how much it stains the skin
so that will give you an idea of
possible wear time again I don't have
any primer on but it'll give you kind of
it just it just give you a little bit
extra information you know what I mean
it's not an absolute none of this is
absolute as far as how it's going to
perform on your eyes but it will give
you kind of just a little bit of extra
information Taylor says I just checked
shipping to Canada from harsh and it's
$20 honestly for Canadians if you're
interested in hush to save money it
really isn't worth it when you factor in
the conversion and shipping well if you
if you think about it the naked heat
pallet is 50 buck fifty four dollars I
don't know what the conversion is to
Canadian but if they let's say you're
paying $20 for shipping if you really if
you can't afford the fifty four dollars
for the Urban Decay palette let's say
you get free shipping then you get the
shop hush pallet is ten dollars plus
twenty o shipping that's still 30 bucks
versus fifty four so to me it still
sounds like it's gonna be less expensive
but again it doesn't seem like it's it's
as good of quality but you know all
right let's do this this one here this
is the honest Asya Glo kit and I only
have this one so I'm just gonna swatch
these for you hard candy
mimosa starburst and crushed pearl and I
just want to see
now with highlighters pigmentation isn't
necessarily the most important thing
because if you have super super
pigmented and you're gonna get that glow
from space thing but not everybody likes
that look so we're gonna see how it
compares as far as the glowy nests of it
so we're gonna start with this is called
this is also from bad habit this is
called the paradise palette I don't know
why I'm having trouble finding it it's
weren't there I was gonna do an eye look
but it looks like we're probably not
gonna have time they definitely feel
like they're pressed harder in the pan
ooh that one feels creamy this is like a
cream that's weird
these are like powder but this one
definitely is a cream that's so weird I
am NOT a fan of cream highlighters mixed
with powder highlighters I don't know
whoa
holy moly okay so let's talk about what
just happened here because I haven't
used that yet these four are from ABH
these four are from bad habit holy moly
Oh which glow kit is this that's a great
question this one is gleam I have the
gleam one thank you for asking that
because I forgot all right but yeah
there's definitely a cream going on here
I don't know if you can see the little
how its swatching but there look at that
that's crazy I'd be curious to try these
on my face I've not tried these on the
face yet
all right let's I'm gonna try to wipe
off just the ones from bad habit see if
I can do that nope not gum at all
alright let's just take them all off
Kristina says a lot of time the original
ends up being cheaper than the dupes we
have to pay twenty throw in thirty
dollars shippings and it's a dollar to a
dollar American to a dollar thirty to
Canadian I mean you'd have to do the
exact math but it seems like a pretty
significant difference between thirty
dollars and fifty four dollars you know
like I don't know mmm all right so this
one is called the Oasis palette see this
is this is a cream it's like it feels
like powder and then the more you get
into it it's a cream I'm just gonna keep
digging into it
so I want to see if I can get to like a
cream there too but I guess not I guess
it's just the one up in the corner is
like a cream I just dug way too much
into that shade nude beach but I wanted
to see if I could hit a cream shade this
one definitely feels different they've
got a creamy texture to them though this
is a weird formula pigmentation is
insane
wax that's crazy
see I would like these four eyeshadows I
want to put those on my lids forget a
highlighter I want those on my lips oh
my gosh well I was hoping that as I dug
down like maybe it would feel more like
a cream but it doesn't it's just the one
up in the top left corner it seems like
a cream very weird alright we've got
three more pallets left to talk about
I'm kind of glancing up at the chat
Steph says I'm looking at the color pop
deep of the gimme more palette not crazy
about the color pop how it wondering
about the difference is I'm not sure
which one you're comparing it to as far
as dupes
I don't have the gimme more in my brain
right now Ashley is recommending the
cover effects highlighters because
they're not quite as from space alright
this is supposed to be the dupe for the
hood of Beauty palette they don't
advertise that it's a dupe for the hood
of beauty palette but I mean you look at
it alright so let's just do a bunch of
swatches cuz I don't have the hood at
one this one feels like the highlighters
this one in the corner
I you know what I should have done cuz
stephanie has that hood of beauty
palette I should have asked her if I
could keep it because she doesn't like
it she hated it and just sitting in a
box and she basically was trying to give
it to me and I was like I don't want if
you don't want it I don't want it but
this shade I don't know what's going on
with that creamy formula that's crazy I
mean this one looks patchy really patchy
oh this palette is called the Aphrodite
palette Mari I think is how you
pronounce your name I'm hoping Oh Gigi
says the a BH Nicole Guerrero versus the
color pop gimme more gotcha
okay all right let's do lost
romance adore and crush because I know
that some of these were supposed to be
like glitter toppers like this one looks
like it's more of like a glitter topper
very interesting very interesting all
right let's go into hmm blushing
seduction jealousy and infatuation I
don't know if I'm gonna have room
running out of room here I mean there's
watching beautifully Vanessa says sorry
about the shipping lovely Canadian
friends but to be fair you get to watch
the your hottie pm on the news every
night jealous I don't even know what
that means
hottie p.m. I'm missing it sherry gets
it I don't get it I'm not up on my
Canadian stuff apparently all right
let's wipe it off they stay there pretty
good well it's pretty good
all right we're gonna we're gonna try to
zip through this and see if we can get
like a five-minute I look at the end of
this Oh
Justin oh the Prime Minister Justin he
is he is kind of a cutie in they I don't
know we shouldn't we probably shouldn't
should show a little more respect but he
is cute yeah you can't you can't get
away from it he is kind of cute
I didn't realize p.m. Stanford prime
minister I do I do I get it now now that
I know the PM stands for Prime Minister
all right ADH globe kit this one's
supposed to be well this this is called
the Rose a palette and I believe this is
a dupe for or it's supposed to be a do
before the you Nicole Guerrero palette
I'm not feeling that cream that I was
feeling with the other one oh I saw have
some matte
okay I'm kind of a glitter city over
here but these highlighters are no joke
look at that that's crazy man
the ten dollars they're all $10
everything Amy want to know the price of
the Aphrodite all right oh wait there's
still two more to just watch I'm going
to fast all right well you saw those I
will do the last two hold on okay AC
wants to know if they're cream to powder
it doesn't seem like it it looks like
they're just powder though there were a
couple of them that were like cream but
that's insane like that I don't know if
that's gonna look good on my cheeks let
me get a um a highlighting brush real
quick
hold on a second let me get a brush not
a highlighting brush but we'll get like
a fluffy I like this brush for
highlighting occasionally this is the
japonesque I don't even think they sell
this anymore but let's do all day which
is the first one that i swatched that's
the way it looks on the brush and let's
that's pretty that's really pretty
it's so funny how the screen how you're
the what you're looking at like it looks
so dark but I have these bright lights
shining on me wish I knew how to get it
to look brighter so you could really see
this stuff better but that looks pretty
ooh look at the powder kick up though
maybe I was too rough with it now I know
I need to be a little more gentle all
right last one and then we'll do a quick
five-minute eye look I'm running out of
my my my solar water you so much of it
arms getting a little roll here Heather
says the japonesque brush is on
HauteLook no way oh it's so good it's so
good okay and then the last one is the
unicorn glow palette and I would love it
if you would remind me what the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills palette is that this is
kind of doopy for
like I would never wear that on my
cheeks
never maybe settings on the camera off
the look because I'm on my arm I'm on my
my macbook it's off to look and see cuz
it's just a webcam oh my gosh the
iridescent saan that wait that's pity Oh
most don't make up says they just got
those japanesse brushes on shop hush
nice I really like them moonchild Thank
You Jessica I appreciate that
Oh Aurora is it moon child or Aurora
which one is it I think they were
similar moon child and Aurora I don't
know which one this one's supposed to be
though
alright here's those there's definitely
iridescent here
some like true iridescent going on here
those are pretty these I would use as
eyeshadows I wouldn't use this as I
later they're pretty they're really
pretty there's kind of motion together
but they're highlighters so I don't
expect them to be all staying forever
bubbles says the Aphrodite is
unavailable right now remember I do have
that 10% off coupon thing that Jen love
je and l UV if you wanted to use that I
do get Commission if you use it but you
know don't forget if you're coming in
here late if you want that alright let's
go ahead and do a quick eye look I got
to take my glasses off though I should
have put my contacts on because I can't
read without my glasses I'm gonna have
to go like this everybody saying it
looks more like Aurora okay alright
let's go ahead let me get my brushes I
just realized I'm not prepared to do an
eye look but we're gonna do one anyway
because I want to put my my eyes and I'm
gonna use my painter leaks I haven't
used this in forever Kennedy says on
hush they have a unicorn and a moon
light this that one is the unicorn the
one that i swatched okay I'm gonna break
out my new painterly I'm not gonna get
to these things these perfusion palettes
I did like them no they're pretty good I
like them better than I thought they
that I would these were all set to me
from profusion this is their Holiday
Collection stuff
if you're interested in me doing a
little more on these perfusion holiday
things maybe we'll do another chat on
the perfusion stuff I don't know if
anybody will be interested in it though
it's the only thing oh you have to let
me know okay
mirror bah bah bah bah bah ok so let's
put on a little paint early I have to
get up here um Maria says hey Jen big
fan your husband's tattoos look like
Greek icon art is he Greek are you know
we are not Greek
nope unfortunately we have no break in
us not that I know of at least I have
met some lovely great people in my life
though I don't think that counts as me
being Greek ooh oh I haven't used paint
really in forever I had one and it dried
up I'm so thankful to have another one I
mean I had it for years
okay I wish I had time to like do my
brows and stuff but that's not what
we're here for we're not here to like do
like a perfect look and we're just
looking to see how it performs on the
eye so which one should we use let's
leave it up to the community what do you
guys think cats Greek nice Oh Jackie
says please do a review on the profusion
products okay well we'll look into it
Jen says perfusion has a metal lip kit
for 5.5 bucks that's great that's
awesome Annabelle says Emily Noel shed
the confusion makeup and liked it nice
is for fusion cruelty-free mmm let me
see if it says on here I don't know yes
cruelty-free it's got the bunny the good
the real bunny who is that the PETA
Bunny the one with the ears mm no that I
don't know which bunny that is this one
can you see it retro love the subculture
one painterly Mary wants to know is it a
primer it's it you can be used as a
primer it's like an eyeshadow base the
subculture all right let's go for it
everybody wants to see the retro love so
let's do it so let's start with let's do
a little bit of um let's mix peace and
pomp for a transition let me get a
little closer here
it's definitely not powdering up as much
as the subculture does but it's not as
pigmented either so it's really you know
it's it's what you what you're looking
for that's a fake bunny I forget is that
the fake bunny that's not the real bunny
I forget which bunny is which well
they're claiming to be cruelty-free
whether it's a real bunny or fake bunny
there are fake bunnies out there but the
whole cruelty-free thing there's so much
fake that can happen in the cruelty-free
thing I mean there's there's no like
federal regulations on cruelty free and
it's just it's a crazy crazy topic if
you really get into it and seeing like
what cruelty-free means and you really
have to dig deep to find something
that's truly cruelty-free that's why I
love websites like cruelty-free kitty
who does all of that research oh this
shade right here is rebel by the way
this one right here I'm putting all over
my lid you know what I should have done
I should have done the the abh one on
one side and this one on the other side
darn well I'll have to do that for the
full video okay so now we're gonna do a
little bit of I don't want to use that
thick of a brush let's do a little bit
of let's do hippie cuz I'm getting
requests for the greens and we'll kind
of put that over here you guys see
hopefully you can see it's definitely
not patchy but I am getting some powder
kick up there you go
it's not really showing up green but
that might be due to the transition that
I used hmm it's really coming out gray
like I don't see the green at all okay
that didn't work out very well hmm
what should we do next okay let's try a
little bit of revolution and let's tap
that over on the side here again this
look make him come out crazy but I just
want to show you how it performs on the
eyes I don't have full faith in my
ability to use this palette right now
I'm so mad that I didn't do one on one
side and one of the others kind of would
have been better
ugh I'll have to do that at a later date
that looks cool that looks good looks
good oh no someone says I just froze Oh
No okay let's go into let's do I con
let's do this one for fun I mean that is
showing up like crazy let me do do you
know what let's just dip into the a BH
subculture just for that icon shade I
want to see guess it's not too late into
electric
see electric is more of like a topper
where the one from shop hush from bad
habit is more of a shadow it's a foiled
shadow you see there there is a
difference
where I feel like the pigmentation is
more therefore the one from shop hush
but you're not getting that I don't know
it's the one from ABH is glittery er it
has more glitter in it it's more topper
like okay let's pack a little bit of
rowdy in the outer corner of this side
I'm gonna wipe that off really good and
let's go back into retro love and we're
gonna tap a little bit of nostalgia on
this side I don't know if you can see
hopefully you can see okay and then
let's blend out
well that's gone huh and that's still
there okay so the one from ABH it's
still there and the one from bad habit
is gone let's try to put that back
almost padded on with my fingertip kind
of blend it out with my fingertip
instead and then now it's staying
you just can't blend it too much okay
let's go into a little bit of peace on
the brow bone I feel like from my skin
tone I wish there was a lighter brow
bone shade but this is nice for medium
tones and let's use the subculture on
the other side this is Dawne powder
kick-up is crazy
and I was being really gentle too like
it's just everywhere I don't know if I
like that I don't like that but the
pigmentation is definitely more there on
the subculture but I don't like that on
my brow bone and I wouldn't do that
again that would not be a choice I would
make and that would be something that I
would edit out if this were editable not
if you can see I don't know you can't
really see I'm looking at the replay I'm
just gonna go close
I know my brows look like doodoo this
that's not what this video is about all
right so let me put on a little bit of
liner because I don't think you can
really tell what it looks like without
liner let me grab put my glasses back on
and put a liner on do I even have a
liner close by I don't even know oh all
I have in this Milani liner
ergh cuz we gotta go I gotta get off cuz
my son is actually coming home from a
sleepover any moment the doorbell is
gonna ring but I don't know I'm gonna
have to I'm definitely gonna have to do
a full review I would love to do like a
bad habbit week where I did like all bad
habit reviews for a week maybe not this
coming week maybe the following week
okay we're not gonna do a wing we're
just gonna let it be like that okay but
overall I mean the performance of this
is good but again like I was saying it
um you get closer so you can see as I
talk but the lasting power isn't as good
and it will muddy more throughout the
day so just be aware of that but if
you're on a budget and you you just your
subculture is just not feasible it's not
logical for you this is a good
alternative at least so far you know
that's just kind of the way that I feel
about it right at this moment but again
full review is coming Susan says um I
think I need that nearer but if it's the
one I think I saw Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond it's
super expensive it is super expensive
but this is it's a really good mirror
it's really good Jenny says first time
making it a chat so happy to be here at
all thank you so much I appreciate you
being here
yeah sherry says not a bad idea I like
the shop hush weak like I think that
what I could do if I did because I do
three videos a week besides my news
stuff so I could do this one I don't
know
have to choose what would you guys want
to see cuz I have four dupes but I only
do three videos in a week I don't know
are people over the peach people over it
I don't know you'll have to vote in the
comments below which one you would want
to see so our choices for the reviews
would be for the naked heat dupe the
sweet peach dupe the modern renaissance
soup and the subculture do I already
know subculture is gonna be one of them
because it seems like people really want
to see that but definitely if you're
here in the live chat come back and
leave a comment and let me know which
ones you want to see because I can I
really can only do three maybe the
fourth one could be another time the
hooded Duke Cassie I can't really do
because I don't have the real hoodie
palette and I'm so mad I wish I could I
wish I had grabbed it from Stephanie
while I was over there because I know
she hates it she was trying to get rid
of it and I was like no thank you
oh well oh well alright um so yeah
definitely come back yeah everybody
seems to be over the peach everybody
says no peach so let's let's not do the
peach let's do the naked Heat well do
the naked heat will do the subculture
and we'll do the the modern renaissance
does that sound good unless there is
like a but maybe there might be a big
revolt in the comments where people
really want to see the sweet peach so
we'll see we'll see what happens it's
like there's a mix between people are
like sweet peach and then they're over
the peach I don't know we'll see alright
well thank you guys Oh bubble says the
Aphrodite is unavailable so there's no
point in doing that this week what
wouldn't be this week it would be the
following week I can actually um check
with the people over at shop hush and
ask them when it's going to be back and
it's not gonna be back any time soon
you're right there really isn't a point
that's a really good point
I'll find out there he says to phase
clover they don't make a do for
two-phase clover right now and I didn't
buy it I wasn't planning on buying it
but oh no so thank you guys so much for
being here I really appreciate I hope
you found that video fun and helpful I
know I had fun hanging out and talking
with you guys about these I'm excited to
dig into them more hopefully gave you
some good information on them so you can
decide whether this might be something
you want to purchase and thank you again
