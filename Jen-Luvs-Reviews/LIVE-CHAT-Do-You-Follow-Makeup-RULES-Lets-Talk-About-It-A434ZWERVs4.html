a makeup chat I'm so excited that you
are here today we're gonna be talking
today about make up rules and what are
some of the make up rules that are
pretty commonly said why do we say them
are they good are they rules we should
follow or the rules wish they completely
break and get rid of or are there rules
that we kind of bend a little bit and
we're gonna talk about what we all do
what we should do what we shouldn't do
all of those kinds of things and it's
going to be a really fun shot i'm very
excited to talk about this stuff today
so if you are watching live thank you so
much for being here if you're watching
this later thank you so much for being
here know that I've got something here
that I like to call the collective
brilliant a flake up awesomeness also
known as the live viewers who are going
to be contributing there are wonderful
knowledge to our discussion so that we
can all learn from each other and spend
more money on things that are awesome
and less money on things that are junk
and it'll all work together the
collective brain to help each other out
so I'm going to go ahead and pop over to
the chat window to say hello to the
collective brain so hopefully everybody
could hear me I have my new microphone
plugged in so I'm hoping everything is
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and say hello
to the first people that were here so
hello to Kyla and hello to Natalie she
says she has to watch the recap after
church hello Natalie welcome back to the
recap thanks for popping by and say hi
before you left and then hello coffee
she said she's looking forward to
participate as it's the right time for
her increase and the title seems so
interesting yay and the morning to
Chrissy she says hello from Northern
Ireland I don't follow the correct uses
of some products and brushes like for
example I use blush brush to contour I
shadow brush to highlight yes we should
definitely talk about that that's not on
my list but I think that's a really good
point Christy and then dances with
beauty good morning to you I'm glad that
you're back good morning to Julia I'm
glad that you're here and Tabitha the
morning good morning to Julia and
Tabitha says make up rules there are no
rules reminds me of Greece you ever see
it hopefully you've seen the movie
Grease
anyway dad's good morning to you and
then Julia says I don't i was about to
type i don't know any makeup roles i'm
here to learn them LOL and and dan says
the first full of makeup you don't talk
about makeup and so bringing in the
grease we're bringing in the fight club
this is a great way to start jet and
then Kristi says Jen a rule I hate is oh
you can't wear a bow tie in a bold lip I
think that sometimes it looks great with
both and that is one that's on the list
of things to talk about and then Becky
says hi I know that was a play on Fight
Club but i agree i don't think there are
any rules with makeup so we're going to
go ahead and hello to everyone else
generation la shallow and KJ and Becky
we're going to go ahead and I'm going to
scroll all the way down to the people
and the conversation that we're having
right this very moment and a not says hi
jen is 5 p.m. here in Israel yo I'm so
glad I would love to come visit Israel
let me drink out of my words if you make
it a coffee mug hashtag not well not
really sponsored I made this but i only
get like two bucks if you buy one but
that's cool if you want to buy one
they're really neat maybe even less than
two bucks i think it's less than that my
coffee tastes like splenda this morning
for some reason I don't know it's very
weird enough with Splenda in there all
right so anyway what I did this morning
was I googled make up rules and I went
to the very first for website that came
up for make up rules I'm just reading
this art I got strike for a second time
I try to stay focus is that alright
wrote this the first one that came off
the first um website that came up was la
roche-posay which is a skincare company
you can buy them at a lot of drugstores
and they've got ten rules of ten habits
for healthy effective makeup rule number
one is to systematically cleanse the
skin and of course this la roche-posay
so they're going to say you know to
really push the skin care you know
because there's they're all about the
skin care it says you cannot get a
perfect finish to your makeup if you
have not properly cleansed the face dust
accumulated through the day prevents the
skin from breathing and make
from holding no more than once a week
use an exfoliating cleanser to purify
and smooth this is one that I always
wash my face before bed I cake take my
makeup off I wash my face I do all that
before bed I do not wash my face in the
morning my concern that I've always
thought and this was my concern for a
while is that that cleansing too much
strips the natural oils out of the skin
and I'm not trying to dry out my skin so
that's kind of where I'm at with that 1i
I do not cleanse my face in the morning
I do moisturize in the morning but I
don't cleanse mine I guess I feel like
that with the with the oils that are I'm
not really getting a lot of dust and
dirt on my face while I'm sleeping so
it's like I don't know I feel like
washing my face in the morning is a
little bit of an overkill I don't know
how do you all feel about that I'm gonna
go ahead and start reading the
collective brain Nikki six five four
three great Instagram that is so true
you have to kick to Eve to care wait
whoa I lost it when I met Nikki I got a
scroll up a little bit i lost you okay
she says that is so true you have to
care how much you take your makeup off
as much as you love putting your makeup
on i agree i think that's really
important to UM take your makeup off at
night my only concern about taking
makeup off at night is how much have to
rub my face in order to get the makeup
off it always bothers me Seth says if
you watch these flate too much your skin
can freak out I agree and Julia says
what about eye crusties I just go like
this and then the eye crusties are gone
j and nikki says jen it doesn't dry it
out i have skin leaning to the dry wit
baba oh it's going too fast okay I want
to go back up on him Nikki's arguing
with me all right which is a good thing
Krista says she uses a toner or my solar
water mostly in the morning and then
nikki says Jenna doesn't dry it out I
have skin leaning in winter use a toner
as soon as you wash even to even the pH
level there is dust in your face even
after a few minutes all right Nikki
maybe I'll start washing my face in the
mornin I mean I'm just like you know I
think people sometimes like assume that
if you have a channel on YouTube that
you know everything there is to know
about everything makeup and skincare me
and that's just not true I'm just a
person like I don't you know so I that's
why I create these topics so that we can
all learn from each other and I am
definitely not a know-it-all kind of
person so
oh you know I can see somebody saying in
the comments she doesn't make up Jen on
you do but she doesn't wash your face in
the morning what kind of person is this
you know I'm just the person man mr.
person I'm 70 says she doesn't cleanse
with a product in the morning either
she's a cognac sponge in water to get
any crime from the night off that's a
great idea Julie says good morning
Genesis the first one be able to make it
here welcome Julie and Kristin says wash
at night rinse in the morning and then
serum very nice lisa says that using
exfoliant every day always have I know
it's not appropriate for every skin type
and I think if you're using a mild
exfoliant some of them say you can use
them daily um ellaby says she's my solar
h2o in the morning and jody says she
washes her face because she sweats and
baby drool and maybe drool that's a baby
joking and maybe drew maybe that happens
because you know we're real people here
and then Jodie says they wash me away
already read that part and then
Catherine says hi everyone I was less I
find it less I do into my skin the
better that it is and i found that ever
since i started really cleansing my skin
I've gotten more wrinkles and I I maybe
it's because I'm not properly hydrating
my skinny because I didn't use a toner
all the time but I don't know Sarah says
she just uses a toner steph says she
washes and tones her face at night so
she can't um I don't know she washed her
face at night why in tones our face and
then nammy says I'm oily but i always
use a hydrating cleanser in the morning
and an eye cream lizette ozie Gina says
she always watched her face in the
morning especially if the makeup came
off early um prior to the prior day and
Liz says she has normal skin she's 46 as
she watched her facing the moisture
should get her off her hands for before
touching her face a gentle cleanser and
not wants to know if I use a clarisonic
and no i don't i have never gotten into
the clarisonic i had purchased one for
my husband for Christmas last year he
used it for like two months and then he
gave up on it so there is one in my
house somewhere but I've never used one
I probably should try it i've thought
about it lots of times oh just as i was
joking it's a song sorry i missed it i
didn't met most it's tough sometimes you
guys get things that I just don't get
thanks for trying to clarify oh I wear
my sunglasses at night so I can so I can
okay thank you
alright Sarah says I started using the
first day beauty radiance Latin lids and
I swear they ended up burning my skin
anyone else oh my goodness nikki says a
clarisonic is super harsh on your face
oh and Kiki says the new ganya water
cleanser is amazing alright I'm going to
go ahead and go to the next tip that la
roche-posay has for us rule number two
apply a skincare product under your
makeup successful makeup application
starts with good skin preparation which
means moisturization with this base
foundation appears even more luminous
choose a skincare product adapted your
skin's means dry combination oily anti
aging etc okay so I do one of two things
in the morning I'll either use a
moisturizer and then a primer or I'll
use a moisturizing primer I typically if
I use a moisturizing primer I won't use
a moisturizer along with it if that
makes sense well it's dance like they're
really pushing skincare aren't they get
this la roche-posay that's why and it
was just happen to be the first one that
popped up so that's where we're starting
I know they see it's all marketing here
it's all marketing and that's the
question two is how much of this the
skin care that people push how much of
it is marketing and how much is it do we
really need these research-based things
are they is the research sponsored by a
company how big was the research sample
these are things that you have to dig
and dig and dig to find out so it's like
I don't know I do believe that it's good
to moisturize my face before I put on
makeup the only thing is in the
summertime sometimes I don't sometimes I
don't washes my face because I feel like
my face has lots of moisture impact but
if I was cleansing first then I would
feel like I needed a moisturizer and
Leslie says she moisturizes every day
regardless of whether she wears makeup
or not and I think that's a good rule i
do i really think that's a good rule to
use moisturizer every day the only thing
I worry about using moisturizer every
days I was gonna definitely because I
really should be using moisturizer every
day I feel like I really want to start
using more natural and apps like natural
based products on my skin cuz I'm
feeling like like okay there's some
things have been really freaking me out
lately like when I put on to my bare
skin
put on like moisturizer or you know
foundation and things and I think about
how it's seeping into my skin and then I
think about that going into my
bloodstream and it's like makes me think
more about natural and organic products
and how it's probably not so good to put
all these chemicals all over my face
every day you know like I don't know
like sometimes it just freaks me out a
little bit thinking about all this bad
stuff possibly going into my skin you
know so but I do think that it's
important to have moisturizer you know
because I mean that's what's helping the
wrinkles stay at bay and all of that
kyle is saying that she uses mostly lush
and it's fantastic Jenny says polished
choice products tend to break her out
and nanny says I get used moisturizer
with SPF 50 every day she lives in
Florida so that seems very very
important Liz says she was a grape seed
oil as a moisturizer that's a good idea
maybe using some like oil some natural
oil coconut oil grapeseed oil things
like that as a moisture every day and
night yeah see Catherine says the same
thing she uses coconut oil as her
moisturizer Brianna says she moisturizes
every day twice a day beauty beholder um
she's telling someone to use a lighter
formula if something's bothering her um
7 e says i love using my beauty oh I
lost it one-on-one a little chief s7 he
says I lost it mom I love using my
Beauty petia for reviews on skincare so
many products really aren't good for
your skin I don't know Oh Beauty pedia
I've never seen Beauty pedia for reviews
on skincare off the check that out
thanks Stephanie and then Jenny send
them oyster eyes every two or three days
and before my primer when I wear makeup
seventy says I just be cancer so I'm
looking for a good organic skin care
products good on you Stephanie that is
so awesome oh my goodness on the beating
cancer like I just oh I have a friend
that's fighting cancer right now so I'm
like it's it's a tough battle man and
I'm so happy that you've made it through
it's awesome Jackie says I can't find
moisturizer it seeps into the skin um I
you know which which on skincare
products that I fell in love with but
they're stupid expensive is the tattoo
Harper line I've really been enjoying
the tattoo heart Berlin I got a sampler
kit from the birchbox shop when I went
to go visit New York for generation
and I really really like their products
I like the way they smell I like the way
that they feel they seep in really
quickly and fast and I'm really enjoying
it really enjoying it little hammer says
I moisturize every day but I feel like
this stuff I use does it make a
difference since one side of my face
feels like sandpaper oh no dan says lush
moisturizers always work for him all
right um let's see I'm gonna go down to
the bottom only but at least says I love
beauty p 2 i also like their youtube
reviews oh my goodness i'm learning
something new today this is awesome see
this is what it's all about my friends
alright it's 1015 i'm going to go ahead
and pop into here the next three rule
number three conceal imperfections
tinting concealers allow you to mask
skin flaws blend 22 to glen 222 i wrote
that means the colors cancel one another
out blend 222 I don't get that green oh
I get this part green neutralizes the
retro J's information recent scars
visible blood vessels and post laser
redness yellow offsets blue of under eye
circles were bears bears casa tea and
post-surgery bruising how a lot of
people get in surgery I guess he's in
laroche Kenzie says I finally figured
how to work the chat and I'm so glad
you're here i'm nikki says you trust
everything in beauty PD says even though
they are sponsored oh oh my goodness I
didn't know that Nikki Holly says tots
are Harper's offerings are top notch try
first day beauty from moisturizer which
moisturizer that observes absorbs
perfectly fairly lightweight but works
um Kiki says i love the LA girl orange
concealer on the most have and then yay
or nay nicole says i love bio bio son
soil be iOS si NCE oil I don't know how
to pronounce that there's too many asses
in there it's confusing me bios aunts um
so I'm looking at this and I'm thinking
okay this I feel like as a tip for a lot
of people I feel like with me I don't
have enough discoloration on my skin for
this tip to appear to apply to me but I
realize that I am definitely the odd
person out in this most people have some
kind of rosacea some
kind of blue some kind of under eye
circles I'm not wearing any makeup today
and I'm very very like I'm very thankful
to have like I have some under-eye
circles like you can see like it's a
little dark here but I feel like with
concealer that's enough for me I don't
feel like I really need a corrector at
this point I don't know that's just me
um Alexandria says that she sometimes
uses the elf color corrector um do you
like it Alexandrian Helen says sorry I'm
late I had to find my rule book so funny
um so I did put on I take hands on you I
did put on something say I did my
eyebrows and I did put on a lip balm on
Islamist and I use the faucet the sugar
one of the sugar lip tints because i
have a little red spot on my lip where
my lip is dry I so I'm wearing this one
sugar lip tint and honey so I just
mildly tented but I'm not wearing any
off my face I did put moisturizer on my
face before I started because my face
was feeling low parched so um kenzie
must know if you tried the new make up
for ever HD concealer yet I haven't I
haven't heard excellent things though
from the preliminary youtube reviews
that things were all sent to the people
some cherries to see when it gets and
not that I don't trust those people
because I think there's a lot of really
good trustworthy people that get things
for you but I want to see the reviews
also from people that did not get it
sense than 3 view you know what I mean I
want to see both I want to see them um
so let me see what you all are saying
about correctors because I can't really
speak to correctors very much Esther
says I have a pink birthmark on my
forehead but I barely notice it and then
Pam says I wear my NIH I lis m under my
eyes nil is nil ism I don't know that
one Alexander says yes she likes the elf
color corrector in the palette but I
used to bye bye under eye from my under
eye circles Bad Kitty beauty so she
needs a good lip balm well get it well
we might get in the lip balms I don't
know forgiving the lip balms today and
dance has my under eye bags are designer
so it's so funny so funny alright papi
says when I'm in a hurry i only can
steal my acne spots and set them with a
powder it's going really fast i'm
skipping down a bit nikki says support
came out with a color corrector
um a few weeks ago it's going to a fast
one on Nicki says the four came out with
color car correct here's a few weeks ago
that looked interesting and then Jenny
says I don't have good luck with
correctors the best i can do is a thing
concealer with a bit of strong tent
leaning toward the corrector color that
she needs when Gina says slow down
people I can't read that that well thank
Allah thankfully we have KJ here and KJ
helps us to collect all of the chats
information and then we put that on
what's up in makeup calm so yes thanks
to KJ if you missed any of the things
that are happening in shadow if you're
watching this on the replay you go to
what's up in makeup calm and you can
read it how awesome is that um let's see
okay Joe India Diana says i love the
pixie peach under I corrector and
holly's oh my that is too fast lost
Holly oh my goodness Holly says search
for under-eye help is forevermore take
it from a born raccoon Italian heritage
Esther says burt's bees and then beauty
beholder says under a corrector really
works ellaby says my problem is the
lines under her eyes oh yeah Kenisha
says wet and wild has a great little
correct wheel it works for her and Pam
says the laura mercier cream concealer
is awesome for making her under I set up
masking under eyes sadness and then
whoever said high above her I missed who
that was but how long to you kyla says
janam here and there's lead in your
lipstick book really interesting no it
does sound interesting and then Jenna
says for gel concealer works with age
Ida says what I primer would you
recommend it depends on what you're
looking for so for high end right now
I'm on a big urban decay Ian kick
because it mutes out discolorations
talking about accelerations I love Urban
Decay's Eden it's amazing so that is
what i've been using also max Paint Pot
in painterly is a big fan of that when
any urban decay primer is really the
Milani one is really the drugstore one
the elf one is a really good drugstore
one those are kind of the ones that i
would recommend alright let's go ahead
and go to the next one because it's 1020
already
all right rule number four even out the
complexion begin by applying your
foundation with four dabs forehead cheek
bones spine and nose of the chin weights
fine of nose and the chin okay spine of
the nose and the chin then spread
outward like cream the application
technique will be the same regardless of
foundation you choose cream fluid
compact okay I don't see how you could
apply powder like that I guess if you
put on the powder and you spread it out
where to apply with a brush and bring
with the fingers turn actually I've
never done the swiping outwards thing
i'll have to try that i don't know i'll
have to try that one um hmm rule number
5 i'm going to kind of go that one seems
a little wonky to me like to always
spread outward i always do the circular
motions um next one it says fix your
makeup finished with a cloud of powder
to set the concealer and foundation and
mattify areas prone to shine like the
forehead chin sides nose to extend the
whole your makeup hold a mineral water
mr. 30 centimeters away from your face
and spray so basically they're saying to
use a finishing powder or a makeup
setting spray and some condition cutters
I really really like this point I'm just
got around the holidays i'm loving at
the original mineral veil by bare
minerals is wonderful also meet art on
the press right here guess when i've
been loving the smooth operator I've
really been loving this these are kind
of my two favorite finishing powders
right now I don't have any drugstore
finishing powders I've never bought one
because I'm just kind of starting to get
into finishing powders stars makeup
setting sprays I don't prefer them just
because it just I don't like breathing
it in and it's like I don't like the
whole process so spraying my face at the
end I don't know it's just my whole
thing Dance has a cloud of powder just
suck up all the moisture in your face
ladies LaRoche says if they want you to
buy more moisturizer um Ezra says got
smooth operator from Ipsy and he/she
loves it I'm gonna say she I'm gonna
assume but it could be he loves it Ezra
I think of as a as a male name so I'm
going to say he um Liz says Jenna love
the paul mitchell Oh up the app I miss
when
that was something hold on a minute a
lost jewel is uh it's spelled aw aphi
iowa fee miss Boyce earnest it's 1129
for a good sized bottle and you can get
it in a hair salon interesting pam says
I just got the it cosmetics bye bye
pores Finister so awesome I just started
using that I'm not I I need to use it
more I just got it in my own I decided
in my gym almost a generation like lucky
bag my beautylish lucky bag and I
haven't used it much I do want to use it
definitely want to use it more it
already seems like it's getting a little
hard pan on it which makes me a little
nervous doesn't seem to be I don't know
oh no I got you even more I gotta use it
more Tanya says she likes the Cote
powder as we're finishing powder that's
dumb blue who opted in it with that mo
baking thing the cote powder oh my gosh
that blew up everywhere but i've heard
it's great i've heard it's great and
jenny says do you be careful with
powders ladies final email patters can
we breathe in and cause respiratory
issues oh my goodness all those things
all those things I'm going to scoot down
to the bottom of this Pam says limit I
lost it KJ say good morning to krista i
love how you guys talk to each other and
know each other thats so awesome Alexa
so she's using the hard candy setting
screen is Grace fine but it makes your
makeup move around a lot it's
interesting and then um Jenny and Nikki
are talking about the Mario Badescu one
and the dances with Beauty says she
loves sprays but she's definitely go for
the four natural for those and then
Snape's honey says elf setting spray is
pretty good ok Hades agreeing about the
mineral veil the bare minerals mineral
veil alright I'm going to go on to the
next one cuz we gotta keep rolling
because I have like four websites i want
to go over i only wear to get to all of
them and rule number six that sculpt a
face with blush this step will also give
you a healthy glow apply the blush the
apples of your cheeks for a burst of
radiance the such a color will liven up
the complexion i don't think any of us
will agree will disagree with blush can
be very nice when applied subtly I think
there's def you can definitely go
overboard on Bluffs you don't wanna go
overboard on blush because that's one of
the things then they can really make you
stand out as a person with too much
makeup on when you have too much
also a natural blush you're new to using
makeup using one that's dumb just a
little different than your skin tone
like for example some of the gloves that
I really like my friend Gayle sent this
to me this is shame on you by Sephora
it's just a very natural blush and
there's one called nude i believe by NYX
that's wonderful have to get that out
where's my mix this one fell it's called
natural this is by NYX this is a really
nice one now these are close to my skin
tone of course your skin tone is
different than mine most likely but if
you are my skin to see that one you
can't even see on me I think that it's
getting old though too so I think that
it was more pigmented to really dig in
there I think it was more pigmented when
I first got it but definitely look at
your skin tone find a blog that's
similar to your skin tone and kind of go
with that Leslie says yes natural blush
and less and less on stage and then use
a rosy red rosy pinky red mix I think
that for evening looks it's nice to have
a little bit more blush I use a little
more blush when I film things like that
there's definitely times to use bright
crazy blushes but just using them subtly
you know you can use a bright pink blush
and then just kind of subtly blend it
out you know um and then Adrienne says I
smile to apply my blush i was told that
a person who wears too much bless is an
indication of possible psychosis wow
that's an interesting statement oh my
goodness Wow okay let's go ahead and
move on um oh Jenny said much she needs
a cheek pop and then Stephanie saying
that you when blush palette is amazing
and I have heard nothing but amazing
things about the new blend Stefani Urban
Decay club the the cheek palette I
really want to get it it's one of those
things that I want but I'm probably not
going to get because there's no real
reason for me to own it but I do look at
it drool over it oh my goodness all
right step number rule number seven says
glorify the eyes this is very
interesting it says to open up your gaze
apply light colors to the inner lower
lid right here in our lower lids that's
here because they capture the light use
the most intense shades the outer corner
of the eyes for sophisticated
mesmerizing eyes a touch of mascara will
prefer
your makeup but they don't say anything
about eyeliner which I thought was very
interesting and that comes up later in
another website that I have loaded for
you and I definitely agree when you use
eyeshadow i feel like the lighter in the
middle and dark on the outside
definitely is a great rule of thumb I've
seen a lot of people doing darker on the
inside and the outside to make the
center of the lid pop which also looks
very good but I feel like for most
people that you know aren't going for
that Instagram kind of thing I feel like
you know that that rule of the inner
being lighter and the outer being darker
is a pretty good rule to follow overall
you know darkening up into the crease
and then later kind of over here also
the light on the bottom lash line is
also very nice to open up the eyes um
let's see what people are saying Helen
says I roles are useless unless you take
I shape into consideration I agree I
mean I well I don't know if I agree
Helen because I feel like everybody can
kind of follow that rule of the Lights
to the dark I don't know do you guys
agree with that do you feel like that
everybody can kind of follow the rule of
light to dark I don't know um a lot of
people are agreeing with Helen as far as
everybody is different but I don't know
i'm not sure if like that kid that
general rule of thumb can go for
everybody I'd love to hear the
collective brain thinks about that um
let me see seventy says I should have
rules help me as I learn my own eye
shape and gave me some guidelines to
start answer really good point Stephanie
you know to kind of use those rules to
start and then play around with your eye
shape to see what your eye shape can do
definitely and then Jenna says I small
eyes what are my rules and I feel like
you know a lot of times people say that
you don't want to put too much black on
small eyes because it will make the I
smaller I have heard that but then one
of the rules in here is it's on another
page is you don't necessarily have to
follow that rule I feel like any time
you can brighten the lower lash line I
feel like that can really make the eyes
look wider also mascara can make a huge
difference for small eyes um definitely
like a really big the eyes boat I was
watching a tutorial
the other day of a friend of mine and
she had put on mascara on one side and
not the other and I looked and I was
like oh my goodness like her I looks
twice the size with mascara on than
without it was crazy it was absolutely
crazy and I'm trying to remember whose
video it was but it was a friend of mine
that i watch all the time and I can't
remember her name of time I it's like
sometimes my brain just goes um but yeah
I mean I feel like mascara makes a huge
difference when it comes to UM to making
your eyes look bigger and then somebody
just said that I lost it but somebody
said that um well I mean I got to go
back because it was good and now I lost
it okay hon I met okay it was beauty
beholder says liner really opens up my
hooded eyes um let's see steph says at
the end of the day all I shadow is is
pigment pressed in a pan or a loose jar
with no rules attached thanks Steph and
Christy says call me we're but I tend to
follow what drag queens do only in a
super toned down way well drag queens
are really good at makeup as far as
knowing where things are placed it's
just you know they can't fly it in a
very heavy way I think that's a relief
very interesting perspective Christy I
never thought of it like that all right
and then Kylie says I sometimes do the
halo effect which is the is that the
later on the outside and then darker on
the inside of thing and applied dark oh
she says it and apply dark on the inner
and outer and place the light in the
middle and that really yeah okay so
that's what we were talking about before
with the with the dark on the outside in
this and then her comment cut off but
I've seen beautiful tutorials with that
Paula says I have big black I am big
eyes and black ina looks ridiculous on
me makes them stand out too much so
that's good chat is moving fast this
morning Bad Kitty beauty totally agree
all right let's move on to the next one
rule number eight says enhance your
smile begin by tracing the outline of
your lips with a lip pencils divine
their shape this lip liner repentant
prevents lipstick from bleeding and
helps to hold better choose a shade that
is the color of your lipstick close to
call your lipstick apply your lipstick
from the center of the lips to the outer
corners for added shine add a touch of
lip gloss and I feel like this is a
pretty good tip I feel like this is one
that's that's pretty you know standard I
personally don't use a lot of lip liner
because I feel like with nude lips you
don't necessarily need a lip liner but I
do agree that sometimes it will make it
last longer if you do wear a lip liner
especially you apply it all over the
lips um now one thing that I really want
to start getting into them if I don't I
think this in my what's in my face video
that's on 17 makeup calm we talked about
this because when I was getting ready on
periscope for filming what's up and make
up I couldn't find a red lip liner I
just don't own one this is one that I
own that I think it doesn't have to be
this brand but this is a it's called
silhouette lip liner and filler by Lord
and Barry and it's just a clear it
doesn't look clear because it has
lipstick on it it's like a waxy clear
like lip balm I'm not lip balm on lip
liner I don't know what the difference
is between this and a lip balm but it's
clear there's nothing to it there's also
one by urban decay called ozone I feel
like that may be that a good option for
people that don't own lip liners don't
want to own a lot of lip liners um you
know to have something like that but
it's so creamy it doesn't have the same
texture as a as a lip liner like it's
more oily like it feels more like a
primer on like a silicone rather than a
creamy lip liner you know what I mean
time flies says lip liner is a must for
me to find my lips in order deep in the
 i'm using most of the time I whoa
most of the time I have to deepen colors
because of my tan skin unless I wear
sheer lip product and i can see people
women with deeper skin tones definitely
meeting lip liners can definitely see
that because you're gonna have to use
not have to but you're going to want to
use more often deeper colors because you
can get away with it more on a casual
basis because the deeper colors are
gonna be more natural on you than it is
for me so my deeper colors like I feel
like I need to have a lip liner so that
it doesn't seep out into here but i can
see women of deeper skin to us really
need that um but i don't know i still
can't get in on the lip liner thing I
even though I
it's a good idea I can't get in on it
like I don't know like I don't I don't
get in on it I don't know what Tanya
says I also overlined my lips most the
time to even them out and that's another
one that's on hairs about over lining
your list I'm terrified to overlap my
lips absolutely terrified over my lips I
think it's gonna look ridiculous I've
never done it I'm very scared and every
time I see Manny anyway looking all cute
I'm always like maybe I should try that
and it's like I can't get away with that
you know like but I think I might be
able to I don't know Chris is saying she
loves the color pop liners just so just
throwing that in there stephanie says
she never uses lip liner and she really
doesn't on a minute whoa doesn't think
she's missing out sometimes she'll use
rebels East End snob but usually just
doesn't do much for her um Jody says I
have I don't have the feathering problem
so she doesn't align interesting and
Krista says she tried over lighting it
looks like I think it's gonna look
ridiculous on me to Krista all right
we're gonna move on over here Pam says
I'm all about the Urban Decay ozone
primer I rarely use a liner interesting
all right I'm gonna go ahead and go over
here to rule number nine which is clean
your brushes for those who apply makeup
with a brush remember to clean them at
least once a month with a suitable
cleanser this will minimize the risk of
allergy while extending their shelf life
I am so bad at this like I probably
clean my brushes like every three months
it's bad it's really bad and I think
part of the reason why I clean them so
not frequently is because I don't have
problem skin so I don't like there's
nothing in my face that says you need to
clean your brushes I'm gonna break out
on you if you don't clean your brushes
you know what I mean so I'm really bad
with it so probably about every three
months is when I clean my brushes oh
it's really bad um so I know I need to I
know it's bad I definitely think that's
rolled people should follow is cleaning
the brushes more often um
and then rachel says i wish i had more
brushes so i could clean them less but
then the thing is I have it I have a
ridiculous amount of brushes or it goes
my brushes but I just end up rotating
through them and they all get dirty like
super masculine rotating too much what I
really need to do is have like sets of
brushes and use a set for a month and
then get the next set and use that and
like use that for a month while I'm like
washing the other ones you know like
that would be awesome like they like
separate them out but then I would miss
my favorite brushes you know but it's
really really important to clean your
brushes I'm just really bad at it some
things that I use to clean my brushes
Stephanie wants to know get good
cleaning solutions one thing that I've
been using that I really like is just
Johnson's baby shampoo um I feel like
that works really well i don't know if
it's too harsh on some brushes i haven't
had any problems with it I've heard some
people say don't do that because it's
not good on the brushes but I haven't
had any problems with it at all um so
Christine says she loves cleaning
brushes stress therapy Christine come to
my house christine lee 314 great YouTube
channel very real um you can come to my
house and clean all the brushes you want
you get and i'll make you dinner if you
clean my brushes i'll make you dinner
how about that will do that christine
lee says goat goat's milk soap is the
best that is so interesting and she is a
makeup artist so um and then beauty
beauty beholder says i use a vino soap
and then dr. Bonners is being
recommended by sammy and then Jenna says
replaced the elf brushes instead of
cleaning oh I don't feel like you're
buying me that christina says I'll be
right over oh no depressions like piling
I really like someone else brushes like
Mike my ELF this one the blush brush
this is like one of my go-to brushes the
elf blush brush I can't see throwing
this way I just can't love this thing
love it love it it's so good it's such a
good brush that's probably my favorite
elf graph for the whole time um let's
see stephanie says i use oat every other
washing it dries her natural hair
brushes out bad oh really and then Tanya
so she uses dial antibacterial on her
beauty blender and every
beauty haul 401 Beth says dr. bronner's
is amazing another instagood instagram
channel beauty haul 411 i called it a
channel Gina says she uses alcohol
that's interesting um and then let's see
a bow and then Julie says eat dirt extra
virgin olive oil and Dawn mixed works
great that is so interesting I learned
so much this is what the collective
brain is all about this is so great oh
my goodness all this makeup knowledge
all in one place all right let's move on
I do want to get to another article and
the last one I think is one we can all
agree on remove your makeup every night
to allow skin to breathe it is essential
that you completely cleanse your face
each night to eliminate makeup in the
days and cure DS which prevent the scan
it from burning thing for sensitive skin
cleansing milk or my slur lotion are
preferable and I think we can all agree
that it's important to take your makeup
off at night but I can tell you if you
go back far enough in my videos there's
a video it's like for a bunch of it's
like at my first QA that I did and one
of the earth I feel it was one of those
but like tags or whatever and they said
you know what do you use the cleanse
your face and I looked at the Cameron I
said I don't cleanse my face because
until I did YouTube videos I didn't I
never washed my face ever ever like ever
I didn't I i would take a shower and i
would splash it with water and that was
it I never cleansed my face I used
makeup remover wipes if I needed to but
I never took my makeup off at night like
I I would leave it on and then in the
morning I would wake up and I would take
off what I needed to take off in order
to put makeup back on really really bad
which might be the reason why I have
these guys up here maybe or maybe over
cleansing I have no idea that says Gen Y
is your skin immortal I don't know I
don't know it's so weird but like until
I started this channel I did not cleanse
my face ever so if you never cleanse
your face know that you're not alone I
did it to start washed and makeup off
night though it's probably probably
pretty good to wash it off of me alright
let's go ahead and move on to the next
article see this is the thing when I sit
here and talk and chat with you
guys I let it all out i am not the one
hurt I'm not a person that hides things
I just tell you the way that it is and
people can say that I'm gross and that's
okay I'm okay with that I've made peace
with the fact that I didn't wash my face
for 30 years or so so but anyway alright
let's go ahead and move on to the next
website and the next one is birdie calm
dyr di e calm and it's five rules of
daytime makeup you should be following
and this was just the second article it
was written in February of 2015 and
we're gonna go ahead and read what she
has to say so rule number one says
always wear sunscreen and I think we can
all agree that sunscreen is definitely
something we should be wearing daily I
don't think that that's um anything
that's that's new or shocking i think
that's really important so we're going
to go ahead and skip that one because i
think we can all agree on that when I
can't imagine somebody saying don't wear
sunscreen rule number two stay away from
dark eyeliners this one I thought was
really weird she says though there are
some exceptions for the most part you
want to stay away from dark liner in the
daylight as it can veer into grunge
Goths territory so easily we all like to
use makeup to make our eyes pop but dark
liners can be too heavy for daytime says
McAdams instead you choose bright
shimmering shadows to give your eyes
definition and make them pop pair with a
great black mascara your eyes will stand
out I love shimmery creams like should
save those cream shadows and bright pink
champagne purple peach tones the ck
wants color volumizing mascara she says
and I can definitely see where she's
coming from but I don't agree I mean I
feel like eyeliner makes a huge huge
difference um they're yelling at Dan for
some reason I don't know what did you do
um but it's like what I know right
Sarah's like what I love black Islander
I'm totally with you I think there may
be there talking to like make up
beginners that don't necessarily know
how to use black eyeliner maybe because
I can see where you're wearing too much
like if you're rimming you're all of
your hole I with black and you're
putting it all up here like I can see
where that wouldn't be good oh you don't
wear sunscreen dan okay well
wear sunscreen every day either at least
in the winter time I don't so I know
it's I should i agree that we should but
I don't wear it every day I should them
that should be my moisturizer is my
sunscreen but anyway I can't live
without my black eyeliner like i don't i
don't know i mean i guess it's a
personal preference thing and i feel
like this is a rule that people should
definitely break if you like wearing
black eyeliner i don't see any reason
why if you love the way that looks on
you if you feel like it looks good why
you shouldn't make up is definitely very
subjective helen i'm totally with you
Timeflies says black tight line on the
outer corner all day every day yes
absolutely i'm with you i am with you um
I think Chrissy says Chad put that
sunscreen on I knew right and Christy's
like I'm gonna slap you Jan I know I'm
gonna do the better though after today I
vowed to do better I will be cleansing
my face in the morning and i'll be
putting on sunscreen everyday I will be
I will be doing it I'm Alexandra says
she does find that she looks better in
brown eyeliner it makes you look younger
I mean I definitely think we need to
experiment with different colored eye
liners we're not wearing eyeliner at all
i think that's important to try
different kinds of things pam says how
am I supposed to look like a pirate
without my golf liner I don't know Pam I
don't know that sounds like a big
problem and you should definitely look
like a pirate as much as you want to and
you should totally go for it um Christa
says I feel like my black eyeliner makes
me look I lost her Christa look like she
has small make sure look better and she
has small eyes mm-hmm and meeting office
before my bestest Jen you don't wash
your face you don't wear sunscreen you
don't wash your brushing off it yet and
your skin guys get is amazing this is
because of my parents it's genetics I'm
telling you it is genetics there's
nothing to do with anything other than
genetics like if you saw my mother and
my father like especially my father's
side of the family their skin is perfect
like my aunt is stinking gorgeous like
my father's sister is beautiful she's in
her 60s and she looks like she's in her
40s like
she's gorgeous so it's just in in my dad
mostly my dad side of failing my mom has
good skin but not like my dad's side of
the family so it's not it's not me it's
not the products it's just and I think
that part of the reason why I haven't
taken good care of my skin is because
I'm so spoiled with naturally whatever
genetic moisturization in my skin so now
that i'm starting to get bit like these
wrinkles up here and stuff I'm like oh
my gosh what we do I have more wrinkles
than my parents do as far as up here
neither my parents have this I'm the
only one so I don't even know so I am
NOT Italian see I am actually my father
is aw he's Irish and he's Native
American my grandmother was French
Canadian um and that side is kind of
over there my mother is a Russian German
Jew so she's all up european in that way
um you know German and Russian over on
that side so um but no Italian that I
know of so let's go ahead and go on to
the next tip because we're starting to
run out of time and 7 45 want to go on
to some other ones alright so next up we
have bright lipsticks are your friends
and my friend Sandra I know would
totally agree with me with this one it's
as a type makeup doesn't only need to be
about sheer lipstick and glossy natural
look some exact macadam says make the
focus of your look a bright lipstick in
a cream formula this will bring light
and life to your look and make you stand
out in a good way choosing a cream
formula it makes for easy touch ups
rather than a matte formula which can
get cakey over time she rises skipping
the lip liner and applying the product
straight from the tube and blending with
your finger this will give a lived-in
look and make it perfectly appropriate
for daytime which is kind of interesting
that she's saying skip the lip liner I
think that's one moves dip the water I
think it depends on whether they feather
on you I think that's going to make a
huge difference about whether it
feathers on you or not yeah absolutely
Helen depends on your age and skin tone
and I think that age meaning your age of
your skin not necessarily the age of you
can't wear a bright lipstick if you're
older you know what I mean Kylie says
she loves winged liner and bright
lipstick absolutely
and crack Katarina says Matt candy yum
yum is amazing neon pink but it's Matt
um I know nikki says for a lived-in look
malpass it definitely says haha lived in
I know right bright lips scare me to
Kenzie they scare me too um Timeflies
wants to know what my opinion is on the
new mug sparklers I have not tried them
if i do try them it'll be after they get
the sifters in because i'm not buying
them without the sifters because i can't
handle all that mess um but anyway so
I'm I feel like with with bright lips if
you're not used to using bright lips
this is what i did is i started off with
with colors that were just a little bit
brighter than my natural skin tone and
then i went a little brighter and a
little brighter and a little brighter
and my friends try like my friends on
periscope if you're not following me on
periscope it's just like this except for
its all the time it's an app that you
download dently recommend you follow me
over there so that we can chat more and
you can join the pair of loves over
there you'll be welcomed with open arms
um the one thing we talked about but
they totally encourage me or you if
you're one of my parallels totally
encourage me to wear bright lips like
the lips that I wore in this today's
show what's good nigga was totally all
of them I had no choice over this I did
have a choice but I told them help me
pick my lips they picked the readout for
me and I'm still not comfortable wearing
it I mean even then I'm on periscope I'm
like I don't feel comfortable with this
look like I'm looking myself I don't
feel comfortable and they're all like
but you look really good it looks great
and I was like okay I'll let it be
because y'all say I look great but I'm
still not comfortable with bright lips
um and I'm still working slowly up to
feeling comfortable with a brighter
color um so I think that everybody can
rock it it's just finding that comfort
within yourself and then that'll really
make you rock it when you can own that
bright lip and I feel like right now I'm
not owning I sound like I'm about to cry
but it's just because I've got some
sinus things going on right the second
doesn't promise I'm not about to cry we
breathe um but anyway um was I saying
totally lost it I think it's fighting
that comfort level within yourself
wearing that bright lip is what's going
to make you be able to rock a bright lip
is when you feel like you can own that
bright lip
and it's all that beauty from inside
thing you know so I'm working on it and
I'm trying it and we can all work on our
bright looks together because it's
definitely not something that I've
mastered all right let's go ahead and
move on to the next one next one says
avoid false eyelashes this is
interesting it says we hate to break it
to you but you're a faulty at if you're
a Fosse attic but false lashes are just
too much for daytime only them they're
only the very skilled at applying them
can get away with some individuals that
blend well says McAdams instead curl
your lashes lashes and use a good
combination of volumizing mascara at the
end and lengthening mascara at the roots
if you are very sparse it / department
and want to boost splurge want to boost
and want a boost they need a comma there
splurge for some subtle lash extensions
there are time and send me to get they
are a great alternative if you want to
get that definition on the eyes she says
I like Chanel and omit to boom in a
middle oh no mascara for lengthening in
inimitable in a middle I don't know so
false lashes during the day what's our
opinion I'll fall / during today my
opinion on phone slashes they are
painting the tush and I don't use then I
need to practice more with them and I
just don't Leslie says if you want to
wear false lashes every day go for it
and people are saying that's ridiculous
Pam says whoever wrote this can kiss my
legit we don't have to do another one of
these because we're gonna run out of
time before we get all the other ones
maybe we'll continue to a part two next
week because there's so many more that
we're not even going to get to um
everybody's like ah hurries freaking I
have to go up a little bit is there some
gems that you guys are dropping if I
don't want to miss them alright let's
see um Cassandra says some fake
eyelashes good look good in the day Bad
Kitty Beauty says also i'm really into
purple lips lately oh okay that's
something else that's from the other
topic um Kate kg says I just started
using demi wispies sign I need to start
trying something like the demi wispies
and then Leslie's comment and lisa says
never wear false lashes just never got
comfortable with them and that's kind of
where I'm at
as far as false lashes I just haven't
gotten conferred with them I have run
them and I have windom in videos of
older videos but i don't know i just
need to I need to get more comfortable
with them and I need to start with like
demi wispies something small I'm
definitely not going to start with
individuals because those things freak
me out Jenny says this is one of those
rules that is just moralistic BS if you
can wear fall season dang wear falsies I
can't apply them so yeah I mean I think
that people need to kind of use their
own style in their own judgment I think
this is a style thing and I think that
some people it's just their style to
have those really long beautiful lashes
I think there's nothing wrong with that
i think this is definitely a real meant
to be broken for some people and it goes
with your comfort zone Devin goes with
your comfort zone Esther says the rules
are there as a starting point you can do
whatever as long as you look good now
all people who forget to put foundation
on their neck and years um the people
who forget to put foundation on their
neck and years they need the rules LOL i
think she's talking about when like so
you don't have that crisp line here i
think that's a really important role in
follow esther i'm totally with you to
make sure that you blend your foundation
down your neck of it so you don't get a
crisp line i remember when i was 13
going to the mall and seeing a girl
working out some story i remember it was
a food store i don't know what it was by
remember going up to buy food and she
had this line and i remember thinking
how beautiful she looked is that weird
or what I remember thinking wow look at
her makeup she looked so beautiful her
skin is just gorgeous with this makeup
on with this sharp line here I said wow
that's so interesting but as a 13 or 14
year old I didn't know any better now I
know she probably shouldn't blended them
down her neck a little bit but you know
I mean I definitely feel like that
that's a kind of an off-topic story a
little bit but long story short too late
yes blender foundation on your neck
really important Pam said oh that's the
PM's talking about whoever whoever wrote
this and krista says we're colors around
the house and then once a day force
yourself to go out and you'll forget
about it and will love it that's
interesting I'm Jeanette says I have a
problem with dark lipstick because you
can see the inner bottom lip color and I
you like you know that that definitely
can happen I try to make sure i bring it
as far and as I can till the texture
changes but some people may not have it
go the texture change far enough in yeah
I'm totally with you I hear I totally
hear what you're saying very interesting
and then um Kensi we already read that
comic Christine says I agree falsies
look overdone during the day and I think
I think it just depends on who it is and
what kind of falsies they are you know
Jody says really that last routine is
bit too much for six thirty in the
morning I'm with you I am totally with
you all right let's go that way Nicole
um I mentioned in what's up and makeup
today that yea or nay Nicole was at
imats in LA today and I don't think that
that's true but i realized that after i
stopped them after i was watching this
morning I was like Nicole's not at imats
la I was thinking about Sandra is it I
mats in LA I don't know why I said that
so Nicole I apologize to you that I said
you were time at senior not there just
so you know alright so let's say next
rule we've got time for like one maybe
two more rules it says skip the heavy
highlight and contour the carving out of
one's features is too harsh for daytime
says mcadams daytime Lighting's does not
lend itself to the illusion of faked
features instead opt for subtle bronzer
and highlighter to give yourself a glow
and define your features and race a
subtle cheekbone cheekbone contour
and a shimmer on the top of the
cheekbone with a little cream
highlighter use powders to fake features
using powders a fake features isn't
going to look really old mcadams
favorite subtle daytime bronzer and
cream highlighter are the charlotte
tilbury film star bronzy glow and the ck
one skin illuminator and warmer i'm
feeling like she might be sponsored by
ck one and charlotte tilbury which keeps
mentioning them or she just happens to
love them um I agree that the sharp
chiseled contour does not look good for
daytime I feel like you know you don't
like the Instagram crazy like chiseled
like insaneness is probably not the best
look for daytime but again it's what you
feel comfortable with you know it's
totally what you feel comfortable with
oh no I'm freezing oh no hold on a
minute
sorry am i back hopefully I'm back cuz I
feel like I'm back okay let me just
repeat what I just said because
supposedly I was freezing okay um I'm
trying to figure out what you guys
talking about I'm not freezing okay all
right so basically what I was just
saying as I feel like that sharp
chiseled craziness is probably not the
best look for most people for daytime
but I do like a subtle carport but I
love like I'll say this for the end time
I elf contour palette I love this thing
I love this thing so much oh I'm
dropping it but this came would give
such a nice subtle contour that I feel
like I can do this during the day fun
what would I even like this one heard
this is the city cut well this is this
is the city color this one is crazy so
pigmented but what I want is really
pigmented like a star zia one can be
really pigmented if you're not careful
um what else is for looking at oh this
one this one's crazy this one is insane
as far as the pigmentation this would be
great on deep skin tones but look at
that just crazy and just have to be
super careful I some swamp Oh though
that's from earlier i thought those from
last night but that's earlier i mean
look at that crazy crazy crazy deep
crazy deep so i would never try to even
attempt putting on that face during the
my face during the daytime but i think a
subtle contour can look really nice and
I really like a bright highlight during
the day I do and I think in the
summertime it looks even more beautiful
to have a brain highlight during the day
that's just my personal opinion I really
love the way that it looks Layla says
she's obsessed with her love her elf
contour kit and nanny says she's
terrified to drop hers what he was
somebody broke something that was
dropped oh no um Jenny says beluga whale
face somebody must have said that
earlier yeah we definitely don't want
beluga whale face that would be very bad
um let's see Christine says how to
contour you for your face shape it's not
one size fits all totally totally agree
absolutely I feel like everybody can
kind of follow that role of starting
here and working your way down to like
here on the eyes I feel like everybody
can kind of follow that one but as for
we're to contour as far as here and like
your nose I think that's extremely
individual extremely in vigil and
hopefully then just get makeup all over
my face because I just realized I
touched my face with swatches done that
before let me switch ever make sure I
don't look ridiculous nope we're good
but I feel like the contour thing with
going like this I think pretty much
everybody can do to an extent I think
you have to play with the placement on
your face but overall I feel like this
is one everybody can do but shaping in
the contouring here in the nose and all
that stuff definitely is individualized
but um okay um Kelly says the bronzer
terrifies her oh no no way really you
should totally do it use it like a blush
I'm Betsy says what are your thoughts on
colored mascaras even just in the bottom
lashes I think color mascaras can look
absolutely beautiful love color lashes
especially on the bottom lash line I
think it can look really really pretty I
mean I'm just a bright pop of color on
the bottom lash line it can just be
absolutely gorgeous um let me go ahead
and go to the last rule I think there's
one more on here before we go oh no
that's it that's the last rule and it's
1059 we did it we made it through to
