beauty rules like last week we did a lot
of skincare this week I think we're
going to do more and makeup related
beauty rules i also want to touch on
make up rules for people with glasses
that was recommended so that is on my
list of things to talk about so if
you've never been in chat before got a
little scrolling chat window over here
that is the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness their job as a collective
brain is to help me we're all too well
our job together as a collective brain i
should say is to work together to get
good information out there and
information about things that are good
things that are bad so that we can all
learn about what to buy what not defy so
we don't waste your money on things that
are terrible and also learning about
beauty roles and which ones really do
work for people and which ones don't
work in which one should we should
totally completely abandon so that's
what we're going to be working on and
talking about today so I'm just going to
take a moment to acknowledge the
collective brain and talk to them for
just a moment just to say hello to the
people that are here I usually start at
the top um and then I go a go down about
10 or 15 people so if you're watching

can get them at the rite aid's jessie's
girl you can get them on deals on hip
sees website you sometimes they're on
groupon you ever run into him Jesse's
girl amen alright I'm going to go into
the makeup rules I've pulled up for more
websites on make up rules so the first
one comes to us if I can find where it
is I've sway too many windows open okay
this is called 17 beauty rules that need
to set that down and this is by
buzzfeed.com this was published in
August 30th of 2015 so the first one is
don't wear red lipstick and heavy eye
makeup and they've got this picture here
there you go and she does look beautiful
so what do you guys think about that red
lipstick and heavy eye makeup I feel
like with red lipstick and heavy eye
makeup you have to be like going
somewhere for most people I think some
people can pull it off like some people
can pull off the whole heavy heavy thing
but I think for the majority of people
like me I could not pull off during the
daytime for everyday wear red lipstick
and dark eyes like I don't know I just
feel like that's just no vid or audio
what no wits one on a minute
well it seems like some people are
getting it because I see some people got
me okay okay Tabitha says it's working
okay I apologize so what do you guys
think about the the red lipstick bold I
I feel like unless you're going
somewhere that's a going out kind of
look for me I don't know I think you can
do it okay stage no stage I mean if
you're wearing if you're a character or
if you're you know singing or whatever I
think you've got it so okay cool most
people can see me so if you can't just
exhale come back um I guess you can't
hear me but um I don't know I just feel
like that's too much for the everyday
for most people unless you're her you
know then you can rock it if you look
like her exactly ok so let's go to a
collective brain brooke says if you can
rock it um it's the amber says on the
girl in the picture it works but for me
i follow that um der saying I've see
your nail collection back their use um
stage makeup Grady says is this today's
makeup as its own animal terry Lee says
I can't more about it all at least I
can't find one that looks good lisa says
I kind of agree kind of traumatic for
every day but you do you go exactly i am
totally with you um krista says if you
work from a curse' for then you have to
look like that at work well I mean that
makes sense because that's part of your
job nikki says it depends on the person
Helen says radish hard to wear most of
time anyway ends up on my chin at times
and Leslie says yep too much for every
day let's go on to the next makeup rule
blue eyeshadow belongs to the 80s not on
your face I think blue eyeshadow can be
done right I mean this girl is rocking
it but I think for most people this will
be too bold for most people um I think
that that's that's a little too much for
the average person she's rocking it but
I don't know I feel like blue is really
nice as for like a lower lashline kind
of a pop or to use a like a champagne
all over the lid with a little blue in
the outer corner but blue all over the
eyes I feel like only sir
people can rock you know how do you guys
feel about blue eye shadow blue eye
shadow um Krista says I cannot rock blue
eye shadow we've got blue eyes too and
they say you know people with blue eyes
shouldn't wear blue eye shadow and they
say people with green I shouldn't wear
green eye shadow but I don't know if
that necessarily is true all the time
but most people are saying but no blue
jenna says no blue megan says all over
blue shadows and no go a partial blue
eyes okay that's kind of where I feel
lisa says it depends on the shade of
blue and I agree with you too I think
this bright blue looks really pretty on
the lower lash line and I think a deep
blue looks really nice in the outer
corner I'm also top blue eyeliner navy
blue eyeliner is gorgeous absolutely
gorgeous so for people that are scared
not scared but people that are hesitant
or think it looks bad like Krista how
she's saying is she thinks it looks bad
on her blue eye shadow I be curious
enough Krista's ever tried a navy blue
eyeliner because I would imagine that
would look gorgeous on Krista PM says
she can't wear blue um Laura says she
loves blue terry Lee says blue accents
only I felt that way in the 80s to Angie
says depending on the color blue Jenny t
says people blue eyes works fine from
blue eye shadow just blend with a
neutral that's the way I'm feeling Jenny
exactly and then Kim says blue eyeliner
is ok my nose is very itchy today I
don't know what is going on here alright
I promise nothing funny's going on
alright just itchy it's cold out all
right Sydney says blue scares her what
is going on my nose hold on sec I gotta
go check I'm not trying to get this task
out with this girl mom alright going on
all right my grandma god bless her soul
used to go like this her nose like that
used to drive my mom and said so I don't
ever do that I try to go away from that
all right definitely scared of blue
Krista says yeah Valerie says I wore
blue all over the lid but I did a really
pretty burnt orange in the crease and at
work that sounds gorgeous and I imagine
blue would look really pretty on deep
skin tones like really deep skin
tonneaus can you imagine like this neon
blue on like deep skin tones not magic
so I'm sure you've seen pictures of it
but this
blum bright blue on a deep skin tone oh
that would be beautiful that would be
beautiful all right and then Laura says
I have olive skin and brown eyes but
light blues work for me dark blues flush
her out all right let's go on to the
next one number three cover-up gray hair
the minute you start to see it gray
hairs a trend this kind of gray hair if
you look like her hair looks really good
I mean I think definite are a lot of
women it can rock gray hair it looks
really good but I think it just depends
on how your gray grows in like mine
crows in very patchy and sporadic like I
probably have about thirty percent gray
when I don't color it um I'm covering my
grades like I feel like I need to cover
my Gray's lake I can only let him grow
like this much before I need to cover
them um just oh but look isn't she
gorgeous though like she's gorgeous my
husband tried to color his hair gray and
it looks really good really really good
he didn't really like it but I thought
looked good Krista says she likes silver
better Kristen d likes it like silver
better um but yeah I think I like I said
I think it depends on the person exactly
i'm totally with you whoever that was
that i miss um lisa says is that
Samantha yes it is yes it is this is
from buzzfeed um Steffes I would look to
dead a dead i'm too pale I think it
looks really gorgeous on some people
beauty behold her that depends some
people can rock it and some not I agree
brooke says so pretty um kelsey says a
hairdresser she says yes I don't know
man that's scary to me that's scary Oh
know about that would it's got seventy
five thousand likes from 26 weeks ago in
the summer but that's like a big thing
you know hey Shannon age how you doing
girlfriend nikki says gray hair supposed
to be super hard to maintain interesting
beauty bears Phoebe's beauty bear set
bar sorry Phoebe's beauty bar says um
looks best with people of color honestly
yeah I think women of color can rock
gray hair
sometimes but I think everybody likes
some I I don't know it it does then your
style to like that's a style thing oh no
all right let's move on to the next one
number four pick one color and stick to
it definitely needs to be broken in my
mind that rule definitely easy broken
picking one column one makeup color and
stick to it multiple colors is beautiful
beautiful as long as you you got them
color-coordinated know you use that
color wheel to help you a little bit you
can use complementary colors you can use
across colors contrasting colors but
yeah I mean really and truly I mean that
is gorgeous and i think that like i love
using one look that i did a couple days
ago i guess maybe it was last week
sometime I can't remember was I had
yellow all over my lid and then I did a
burnt orange in the crease and then I
did some brown to smoke it up a little
bit and it looked so pretty it looked
really really good so Kaylee's lost
don't be lost come back yeah you need to
mention spring says exactly one color I
know right know what color is boring
yeah I know I don't even think that
that's a really a rule maybe they're
saying like if you're weighing Browns
where Browns I mean I think that's a
rule I'm with you on that one purple and
gold for life kelsey says brandon says
um Janice Danielle I just realized that
I'm on my hubby's account I don't know
how to change it oh no danielle i will
try to remember if it says brandon to
say Danielle thank you for telling me
Danielle I appreciate that uh and then
uh ellaby says depends on the cut the
tone etc I think maybe are you talking
about the gray hair megan says be a
rainbow totally with you on that um
Jenny says are they saying you should
not have one hair color no we're talking
about um eyes know about makeup if one
makeup color and stick to it um Helen
says I think the lipstick and blush was
supposed to match I think the lipsticks
supposed to match I don't know oh you
mean like just in general I think
lipstick and blush was supposed to match
doesn't know that she has any blush on
looks like she's got highlighter and the
lipstick definitely matches
I don't know but I think we can all
agree that you definitely need lots of
different colors I think that's really
helpful all right next up girls with
curly hair shouldn't get bangs she is
rocking that look rockin that I can't
really speak to this one a whole lot
because I don't have curly hair like
that but again I think that's a personal
style thing I don't know I think that's
the little overwhelming on her with the
bangs though I mean she's rocking it but
I think that's a little overwhelming I
don't know but you're right i mean i'm
not thinking about it i mean you think
about you don't really see a lot of
curly haired women with bangs Lisa I
don't know if lipstick and blush are
supposed to match I don't know that's a
whole nother thing I don't even know
yeah um and bb's beauty bar says curly
haired bangs is the cutest if you do it
right and i think that's the thing and i
would imagine waking up some mornings
with curly hair and being like what are
my girls doing this morning and I got
these bangs and then putting on a head
band pic no um lisa says she has bangs
and curly hair but hers are super short
definitely depends on the person
comments are going pretty fast Marissa
says i love bangs but they are so
high-maintenance they are so high
maintenance so I think that's a personal
style thing as well absolutely laura
says bangs rule curly hair and bangs yes
hey yes please and Angela says people
should do what they want with their hair
totally totally agree Emily says I would
love curly hair I have curly hair look
terrible with bangs I mean I think it
just depends on your face shape to you
know because if you have round a round
face I would imagine having bangs on
anybody would be make you look more
rounds you know but if you have a longer
face I would imagine bangs would kind of
short in your face a little bit you know
Kyla says I feel like BuzzFeed always
makes vids about how they can't do
makeup so good so who are they to tell
us what to do I have no idea it was just
I google searched on what I did and this
way i did last week two is a google
search and i just took the top results
so i didn't even go by whether this is a
good one or not i just went by what's
the top result all right let's go to the
next one redhead shouldn't wear red
lipstick Oh totally mean to break
that one totally need to break that one
I have seen some gorgeous looks with
redheads and red lipstick absolutely so
yes totally agree redheads should
definitely wear red lipstick totally
totally gorgeous um alright let's just
go to the next ones I think that
everybody's gonna pretty much agree with
that redhead should wear whatever they
want I agree break that rule Grady says
excuse me as a redhead I know right Oh
wrong kelsey says oh wrong false false
lies lies rude not at all everybody's
like no oh no false think that's an
excellent is being drunk all right so
that's definitely a no I think we can
all agree on that one all right number
seven I think they make them extra
dramatic on purpose I know you are
Grady's all right glitter doesn't belong
on your face leather doesn't belong on
your face yeah shannon says she wears
red lipstick on occasion has to be the
right tone though um I think we can all
disagree I think it just depends on
where you want to put your glitter like
and what your personal style is I mean I
think I do kind of feel like glitter
should be more saved for nighttime luxe
I feel like in the daytime it can be a
little overpowering to have a lot of
glitter on but like for younger people
like teenagers and kids and people in
the early 20s and stuff I think they can
rock more glitter on their eyes for the
daily like especially like going to the
beach stuff like that I'm thinking about
the beach because we've got two feet of
snow outside but um you know I think
overall glitter is more of a nighttime
kind of thing at least for me I don't
know there's a time in a place for a
glitter kristin says and then um before
Nikki disappear she said there's a time
and a place for everything Shannon says
glitter is the devil it gets everywhere
yeah my husband hates glitter absolutely
hates it um and we never had glitter at
our house again he would be so happy huh
if you're going to a rock concert rocket
yes exactly spring exactly um when he
says can do glitter at my age I'd see I
feel like anybody can rock glitter
don't think that it has to be an age
thing I feel like in the right occasion
I mean anybody could rock glitter like
you think about like if you walk into a
party and there was a 70 year old woman
with silver glitter on her eyes I would
be like yes you know what I mean like
total yes total yes I think it's how you
rock it you know little black eyeliner a
little silver glitter for a new years
party like whoo like I don't think it
would matter with age it's kind of a
place you know terry Lee says I wear it
i'm 51 um so I don't know I feel like
anybody can really Rock litter but I
feel like the younger you are you can
pull it off more often you know glitter
just gets everywhere Christmas says yeah
if you like to wear if it's your style
if it's not your style you shouldn't be
wearing it all right let's go to the
next one oh my gosh this one's so stupid
i think that they're just making stuff
up just to be like who made this moves
aren't real stick with a classic French
manicure are you kidding me I mean I
disagree with that rule no you shouldn't
stick with a classic French manicure I
think French manicures are beautiful
absolutely beautiful but I'd Emily don't
think you should stick to a French
manicure I can't remember the last time
I wore French manicure oh it was
definitely at least 10 years ago was the
last time I wore a French manicure it
keeps freezing Oh No yeah everybody see
everything be okay if it's freezing
trying to exit out and come back that's
so naughty gia I mean I feel like it's
been I know I think that they just steps
like this is making me angry stop with
those lies yeah I think they just made
these up I don't think they're real
rules I think that they just thought
about beauty trends and then said the
opposite and then you know any mean like
I don't think that these are real I
really don't that's just dumb okay and
you should always match your manicure
and pedicure it's another dumb one I
mean I honestly like I don't worry about
my toes unless it's summertime and
people are seeing my toes
you keep refreshing to I don't know how
to fix that I'd have no idea how to fix
that I'm so sorry step out and come back
okay I'm sorry it's freezing on other
people too and it'll probably freeze on
the replay too I just I don't know
whether it's my connection or it might
be the snow I don't know um but yeah I
mean that looks gorgeous but I don't
really think about my toes like my toes
are a hot mess I haven't paid to my toes
since probably September their mess
they're mad because nobody sees him
except for me and my family except for
when I'm wearing flip-flops and this is
dele not a season to wear flip-flops and
I'll tell you that I just move on to the
next one false eyelashes should only
come out at night and I feel like those
eyelashes can be overdone definitely
especially with the styles that are out
there and can be overdone but very
simple like calm false eyelashes
definitely can be worn during the day
and if it's your style and you want to
rock some big dramatic phones eyelashes
during the day I don't see a problem
with it I just feel like for most people
that's difficult to pull off like the
big huge dramatic false eyelashes but
like demi wispies or something Rock'em
Rocco no Rocco maraca maraca all right
um and then bebes beauty bar says there
are some that look really natural and a
perfect for everyday totally great yeah
it is probably the weather kelsey says I
don't do falsies too sticky and then
Helen says depends on the style of false
lash and let's see Liz says lisa says i
love falsies and I wear glasses now Liz
says I'm tired of seeing all the falsies
around I mean I think it just kind of
depends you know on what your cell is I
don't have the patience to do falsies
like ever I'm even wearing my videos
like I just don't have the patience it
takes patience what's up buddy jack is
trying too much too yes I did that boy
you couldn't get the bows back on you
have to push this button right here
that's the button okay and just push it
one time and then count to ten and it
doesn't work cross it again all right
buddy
about that did you see you i'm not sure
i guess you can probably see if you can
see my makeup stuff here so you probably
could see him but he's just the things
that are critically important to a child
he couldn't get the sound on his movie
when anyway false eyelashes I think it
just depends on your again this is
subjective like Nicky said if you work
in an office probably not but but if you
work at hot topic yes absolutely all
right next one nail should be short and
square I'm just going to skip some of
these these are dumb all right frosted
lipstick belongs in the 90s I got a lot
of flak one time because I left a
comment on somebody's video it was about
the new Mariah Carey lipstick and I was
saying how frosty lipstick just haven't
been in fashion lately and a lot of
people were commenting that like the I
was wrong that this was that I mean I
don't think anybody can disagree that
the UM that okay thanks for all the
feedback on the video quality i feel bad
i don't know what's probably the snow um
what were they saying okay so i don't
feel like was I saying else on that
frosted lipstick and I just feel like
you know I'd only anybody can deny that
matte lipstick has been a trend because
you've seen it in every product you know
like when you go when you watch what's a
good makeup you see all of the mats
everything Matt Matt Matt Matt Matt
nothing says frosty frosty frosty frosty
I do feel like some frosty lip products
are coming in a kind of floating in and
out but it's not a big huge trend right
now um yeah I mean I really like the way
that it looks but I feel like I mean I
feel like this look has kind of overdone
like I don't really like this look very
much I'm she's got the blue eye shadow
in the pink frosty lips I just feel like
that's a little too much like can you
imagine the average person wearing that
look like when you're beautiful like you
can pretty much get away with a lot of
stuff because you're beautiful but like
the average typical person that doesn't
look like this you know we need we need
to be a little more subtle sometimes it
don't I mean I don't know I just feel
like you know I don't know I don't know
I just feel like that's a little too
much for most people megan says those
two face melted metals are quite for
see they are and I do like them but it's
like it's a little too much I feel like
if I'm gonna wear a frosty your lip I
need to have a more subtle rest of my
look in order food out to look
overpowering yeah and dark skin I mean
gorgeous on dark skin but light skin I
don't know if we can get away with that
I don't know it is coming back Jenny I
think it is coming back henzy says is
the new to face blue lips that make
everything frosty yes it does it does
make everything frosty yes it's called
um unicorn tears and yes it makes
everything frosty I have an Instagram
post with some swatches of unicorn tears
over top of a bunch of things you go to
my Instagram which is jevon those
reviews you should be able to see that
um nikki says by the nineties are coming
back so I think frosted is making a
slope come back it's not for her though
all right and then Shannon says frost
make me look dead not a fan but if you
like it go for it steph says I hate
lipsticks they settle into the lines of
my lips though yeah that is not a good
good look alright but this is an
interesting one your eyebrow should
match your hair color I seen some
gorgeous looks of people matching their
eyebrows to their eye look but again I
think this is a this is a UH you know a
style thing I mean she's totally rocking
it totally rocking it like I went to the
hair salon and you know hair salons they
do a lil crazy stuff this girl had red
lips and red eyebrows and it looks so
good it looked so good like I can see a
lot of people being able to pull that
off you know this kind of reminds me of
is at the Capitol in Hunger Games you
know like those crazy bold looks like
that's what it kind of reminds me of um
I don't know I mean I feel like for me
am I gonna put my and make my eyebrows
purple no I'm not doing that I'm not
gonna do it but if you can rocket rocket
you know patty says I've naturally I
have dark eyebrows naturally a naturally
blonde hair that's interesting I've seen
that before on Liz says when I had pink
hair I didn't have pink brows but why
not though why not you totally probably
could rock that though if you wanted to
UM patty says blonde eyebrows look
hideous I think it depends I mean I
think that you can define blonde
eyebrows so they
really really good BB's beauty bar says
I mean matching eyebrows and hair looks
good but it's not a huge route it must
be rule that must be followed some blue
eyebrows just don't look right agreed
and and it's it's what you want to look
like I don't know I think this is
another one that there's there's a
select group of people that this is
going to look good on beauty beholder
says it perfectly says that's a bit
harsh for regular folks and I totally
totally free I mean like I don't know I
can you imagine me walking into work as
an elementary school teacher looking
like that like really my principal look
at me like Jagr new look crazy you have
totally fallen on off the crazy train
like or onto the crazy train number four
don't let your roots grow out without
coloring them and I think we can say
safely say that I disagree with this
rule with my ombre hair I mean this is
this is another one that you know i mean
i think the ombre trend has definitely
killed this one with the whole roots
thing alright let's go on to the next
one never wear mascara on your bottom
lashes we're skipping that one that
one's dumb men shouldn't wear makeup and
look who it is it's Manny and of course
you guys know that I disagree with that
my husband's worn makeup on many
occasions I definitely disagree that men
shouldn't wear makeup there's a good 20
products in my drawers that were
purchased by my husband so no sound
again what is going on so yes isn't he
cute alright moving on all right older
women should keep their look
conservative Kandee Johnson is wonderful
this whole site is dumb oh I totally
agree guys can wear makeup I agree and I
think that guys wearing makeup is kind
of an interesting thing can you imagine
have more men wore makeup like what it
would look at like you know like walking
down the street and seeing Madden like
what they're like even skin tones and
like eyeliner like I think it would look
cute I think would look hot I don't know
oh no I'm a fan of man wearing makeup if
men watch I think it's fun yo makeup is
fun and why should we
all the fun for ourselves you know I was
on watching a video by my friend Sanders
Sanders Kennedy I met him quite a few
times at different beauty events and he
was saying how he went into a supports
like worst of it like I have a video
like worse' for experience he had a bad
experience where he was walking in the
brooklyn sephora and they were like
tailing him like he was gonna steal
something because he was a man and
sephora is what he thinks I didn't end
up watching the whole thing because he
was like really long and I had to go
take care of kids but I know I got to
the point where they were like tailing
into a store and almost like oh my gosh
so I definitely think men should wear
makeup and Sanders looks good with
makeup too and you're not following
Sanders he's got a good channel he's got
a really good channel he has a lot of
drama stuff kind of like Kareena Kapoor
kind of drama stuff on his channel a lot
but he's also got some really good like
skin care advice videos stuff like that
all right older women should keep their
look conservative I love this picture
what a great picture all right Chelsea
says my man I like my manly man no
makeup for him but why can't make up be
manly why can't it be why can't make it
be manly why does makeup have to be
feminine why can't a man where BB cream
to even out of skin tone why can't a man
where you know concealer I don't think
it has to be a female thing you know so
I don't know I just I don't know I guess
it's one of those things where at the
man just has to feel comfortable you
know being able to handle that so yes
yes okay I don't know what older is it
just there's no there's no there's no
clarifier and that's the last one but no
women should definitely older women
should not keep older women should do
what they want to do and younger women
should do what they want to do and all
women and men should do what they want
to do that's what I cuz I do all right
so this this website is done we're going
to close this one okay it's 10 33 we're
moving on to the next one okay the next
one is nine make up rules to totally
ignore this is by yahoo beauty by an
tomlin September for
2014 it's got this cute little rule book
oh I'm with you Jenny men in the movies
wear makeup and it seems to be manly
enough there get a girl exactly that's
what I'm talking about ok so number one
let's say they're not numbered on a
second okay smokey eyes are just for
nighttime we kind of talked about that a
little bit um smokey eye doesn't have to
be black or a worn solely at night for
daytime version choose shadows in the
same he was your eye color blend them
into lightness it still give the
intensity of a smoky eye without looking
goth but i think it's again that's a
style thing don't wear dark liner with
light lipstick this is interesting
because i always saw that as a big no-no
dark eyeliner with light lipstick like
very like not cool um so it says high
contrast the high contrast look came in
during the 90s and most of us have left
it there but if applied with a subtle
hand a dark into light mix can work
there's a time in the place says los
angeles-based makeup artist Jamie
Greenberg it's all about blending if
done right you can create a pretty
effect think smudging and mixed not dark
and it's not starting to find there's no
pictures here I'm a web show um so yeah
you know like to make you look for
daytime I totally agree um screw the
rules that's our collective brain yes
Helen yes Helen um yeah I mean I feel
like Darklighter and a like lipstick is
something I don't want to mess with I
think it like they said it something
that has to be done right and I don't
think I can do it right so I'm leaving
that one of the night I think that that
looks I don't like that look at all
that's just a personal preference all
right the best bronzer is one that
glimmers it says non like dreaming for
an edward cullen vibe I don't get
shimmery when I came the Sun Vincent
says something more matt is going to
look more like heat and sun instead of
looking like makeup um I feel like if
you're keep you should keep shimmer my
opinion in the highlight area that this
is where your glow should be it's
wherever you want to pop out and most of
us want our cheekbones to pop out so the
shimmer should be here so if you have a
glow
bronze are stick to the top of your
cheek that's what I feel like um you
know just subtly here uh and and do that
like you know where the Sun hits you
kind of thing and I agree about the mat
browser i feel like the matte bronzer
should be kind of the thing and then
like highlight I don't know maritza says
she doesn't like glimmer a bronzer and
Angela says she doesn't do bronzer and
lisa says for my age I need Matt but at
least I'm hoping you're wearing some
kind of highlight though because i'm
sure that look gorgeous on you BB's
beauty bar says I agree gem and KJ says
at night a shimmer bronzer is ok not a
contour but a browser yet you never want
a like glowy contour that would just be
weird can you imagine like shimmer all
down here that'd be so weird ok but I
think can all agree on that one so this
one's actually a little bit better so
then this one says as you age matte
foundation is the most flattering this
is interesting that older women
shouldn't wear dewey foundation rule is
the stupidest says vincent you add that
matte foundation will actually
accentuate lines and wrinkles more
texture skin has the less matt you want
your foundation to be he explains adding
a slight sheen of complexion makes it
look more radiant no matter the age
interesting interesting um do I find
Manny's makeup manly no I don't I don't
bind Manny's makeup manly I think Manny
puts on makeup the way that women
typically put on makeup I do think he
looks gorgeous though so I don't know
it's definitely not what we would call
manly but it's like what is manly though
what are gender roles you know who says
that make up like that can't be a manly
thing and I feel like the way that we're
going with gender roles we're going to
go more toward the way that Manny is in
general in embracing his feminine side I
think women are going to start embracing
their masculine side more I think men
are going to start is bracing their
feminine side more and they just feel
like you know we need to accept that
it's okay to not care that men are
supposed to do this and women are
supposed to do this and that's the rule
and that's the way that it is I think we
need to just you know embrace who we are
and what we want our style to be so I
think as we go more and into that and
get more comfortable
with who we are I think we're going to
see more men wearing makeup the way that
Manny does and it won't be considered
not manly you know what I mean because I
guess for him that is manly because he's
a man you know so who's to say it's not
manly I'm gonna go back on when I said
who say it's not manly you know he is a
man right I don't know that's just me I
don't know this is the way I feel about
it and um excuse me Ezra says 18th
century men wore makeup no right
seriously all right I don't know this is
coming from someone whose husband owns
your foundation so you know and is a
tattoo artist and Owens one of the best
attitude studios in the state of
Maryland so anyway moving on all right
she says yes Jen gonna tickets a charge
this more to preach a girl yeah I know
right all right that's just my opinion I
don't know but everyone has a right to
their own opinion so I'm not saying my
opinion is law that's just the way that
I feel and I just totally just wet all
for a minute didn't I all right bring
Jerry all right moving on so let's talk
back about matte foundation is the most
flattering about older women shouldn't
use matte foundation you know I feel
like you need to try different things
for your skin tone and honestly I feel
like matte foundation can look really
flat on anybody you know like that super
mad Mac you know person working at math
look just doesn't look good on a lot of
people you know it's very Instagram II
but for like the everyday look when I
see a woman wearing very flat in that
foundation it makes them look like
they're wearing a lot of makeup you know
what I mean like I think we're leaning
more toward like that um the thing that
she faced was trying to do you know with
the bed what is it the two-faced i have
and i own it or in this way foundation
with the Born This Way Foundation you
know you want your foundation to look
like you were born this way I don't
necessarily feel like the cheek base one
does that but I feel like you know at
any age we kind of are going a little
overboard with how much makeup we're
wearing
that you know we're going more Instagram
II I think we're being influenced by
social media to wear makeup that looks
like too much makeup and I think that's
okay if that's your style but I think
for the average person I don't think we
should be trying to fit ourselves into a
mold of wearing too much makeup because
that's what everyone else is doing you
know and I think the idea of wearing a
more luminous foundation can really give
you a more natural like looks like skin
look so I agree that women of you know
older women and definitely rock a more
luminous foundation absolutely totally
agree totally great let's see what the
collective brain things Phoebe's beauty
bar when God says Instagram is ruining
makeup and I totally agree lastly says
matte foundation reminds me of pancake
makeup and it definitely can lisa says I
have it I wear it but I don't love it
what you have and where but don't love
I'm hoping your are you talking about
Matt makeup I'm hoping all right I
missed a couple things because it's
going really fast nikki says I don't see
people in real life looking like people
on Instagram i'm assuming with the end
of that sentence on instagram there's
the rest of it and sometimes i do
sometimes i do see people in real life
like at the mall I've seen some
craziness at our local mall some
craziness Liz says I cannot wear Matt I
have normal skin and it makes me look
older Gina says blowy over Matt every
time I think she meant glowy over Matt
every time but yes yes she did glowy
thrilling thrilling us if you read
fashion magazines Instagram looks are
out of style interesting um bebes beauty
bar says BB creams are so amazing
totally agree totally agree um Patricia
says I have a natural glow called oil
Angela says I think Instagram makeup is
more glam and every day looks but I
think it can make the Instagram kind of
convinces people that everybody should
look like that but that is what beauty
is so I think people are trying
sometimes to do that for their everyday
and not realizing that that's a
photograph on an on Instagram that's not
like I don't know like some people I
look at a look at there in scrap picture
and I've said this before I look the
inspirational wow she is just so
beautiful look at that look it's so
gorgeous and I think if I saw that woman
in /
I would be like whoa back it up with all
that makeup Oh too much too much but I
mean so I don't know I don't know but
but as far as this rule I definitely
think that that women of any age should
be stepping away a bit from the matte
foundation unless you were being
photographed like I wear a lot of matte
foundations for filming things like that
but other than that I feel like we kind
of need to and I did go on the mat trend
for a while for matte foundation and
I've definitely stepped away from that
because I like the way that more natural
foundations look alright this is a good
one because I hear this a lot from
people in my comment sections oh you got
them thank you Tabitha supposedly there
was a troll on tab god I'm good that's
why I have you moderators boo boo okay
mature women shouldn't wear shimmer I
hear this all that time mature I am too
old to wear shimmer on my eyes let's see
what Yahoo beauty says it says nonsense
insist greenberg my 90 year old grandma
looks better with shimmer on her lids
because it makes you look more awake and
reflects light nicely she says hollis
agrees noting that the product chosen
makes the difference when you want to
create the appearance of a healthy glow
off for a cream shimmer instead of using
a powder shimmer he says that way it
doesn't sit into any fine lines
interesting cuz to favorites are okle or
black opal metallic precision I definer
in metallic bronze and sigmaz shimmer
cream so that's very interesting so I
mean I feel like a shimmer eyeshadow I'm
not necessarily saying glitter okay
because I can see where people aren't
too many by glitter but a shimmer
eyeshadow even on hooded lids can look
absolutely gorgeous like a champagne on
someone of my skin tone like think about
whatever your skin tone is and think
about a shade lighter than whatever your
skin tone is and I think that that can
look beautiful as far as shimmer all
over the lid um absolutely yes to
shimmer yes the shimmer oh my goodness
and the field effect yes absolutely um
Angela says back in the day we didn't do
any shine honey you had better powder
that knows oh well I know well I mean I
think that having like oily like an oily
look to your face is different than have
glow you know and I think that you know
and and if you have especially oily skin
you're going to get Willy through the
day you know and you might want to
powder your nose and you might not
that's really up to you but as far as
the eyes Oh Erica says and steal the
kitten is amazing totally totally agree
let me get still a kitten for you so you
can see what she's talking about because
I happen to have it if I can find it
quickly hold on here we go okay so it
was kitten this is a fantastic palette
if you can still get it this is the
Cielo eyes are the window to the spirit
palette has a lot of really nice shades
like just like we're talking about so if
you think about your out your skin color
so if your skin color is a little deeper
than this this would work perfectly
here's some other shades steal this
kitten is at the top that's this one
here this one is perfect it's gorgeous I
don't know if you can how much you can
see but yes yes total win total win and
if you have mary lou mary-lou manizer by
the bomb it works great as an eyeshadow
but seals kitten is famous for a reason
it's amazing it's amazing but this is
this is a really fun palette to play
with if you are if you like that kind of
look that natural look but i think i
really do agree that anybody can wear
shimmer all over their eyes and it's how
you do it so if you're winning shimmer
on your eyes get that on so you got on
your lid let me get my thoughts together
you get on your lid the shimmer shade
that is just a tad lighter than your
natural skin tone then you go up into
the crease up in the crease with a shade
a matte shade that's slightly deeper
than your skin tone okay that goes up in
the crease then slightly deeper than
that in either a matter shimmer it
doesn't matter you put a little bit here
and you kind of swirl it around and
deepen up that outer corner and if you
want a little extra glam go a shade
lighter than your life color on your lid
and pop a little highlight on this side
I look done forever for ever favorite I
look of all time so yes um Erica wants
to know any thoughts on color pop
shadows I've seen so many reviews and I
don't know how I would apply them and
that's my
the issue with color pop I shadows is
that they've got that creamy consistency
so they're a little difficult to work
with the shades can be absolutely
gorgeous they're very creative in their
shades and I think that's where color
pop has something that a lot of
companies don't have in that their shade
range is amazing you can get all kinds
of really unique colors but the
application is a little bit tricky for
me YUM I try to use my finger but then
my fingers are kind of big and if you
have small lids and big fingers like
you're in some trouble there you know so
I when I try to do is kind of tap and
then I blend with a brush so if I have a
deeper shade I'll tap here and then
blend it up so um yeah just yeah i know
we have 15 minutes left hell and thanks
for the time check my friends um but
yeah I mean I just feel like it's just I
don't know I don't know I like color pop
eyeshadows but I don't go on my way to
buy them I do and my way to buy their
lip products though because they are
amazing all right let's go to the next
one next one's blue shadows outdated
we've already talked about that one next
one says don't wear dark lip colors
unless you have full lips don't wear
dark lip colors unless you have full
lips I think we can all say that this is
not a good one it says not even thin
lips are gorgeous and can wear color to
holla says here's the trick for showing
off rich berry tones line the outer rim
of the lips before applying lipstick
after applying the color accent the pout
of your mouth using a nice gold gloss or
shimmer he says this trip makes lips
look fuller no matter how dark the lip
color so I don't know if you guys have
ever tried that for your lips to put a
little bit of a shimmer here it looks
really beautiful so what I do is all put
either a lighter color like Oprah's
Angeles is one of my favorites to do
this it's not shimmery it's just a
lighter color you put it right here
right here and go like that and then
just blend it out a little bit and it
really will make your lips pop it's very
very nice um wait a minute what's what's
dumb Lupe Lupe says something's done
Holly says help heck with that any lip
color it lipstick is fine while black
isn't for me oh yeah and then nikki says
dark colors on the lips make them look
smaller I don't know I mean I see
like you can I think people with thin
lips can rock a darker color it just
kind of depends on how you do it and and
whether it's your style or not I mean I
think dark lip colors um went on
stephanie says I can see dark lip colors
making thin lips look smaller though not
saying you shouldn't do it but that's
just it's just it could make them look
small yeah I mean I think so too but I
think that um you know but you can do
things to make your lips look fuller and
it's what you feel comfortable with it's
your comfort zone you know like and I
agree with lining your lips I think that
could help I don't think that over
drawing thing that over drawing lips
thing freaks me out like Manny he /
draws his lips all the time and it
totally freaks me out like for me
personally like it looks great on him
but I can't do that like it just well I
plus I have bigger lips anyway but um I
don't know I think over drawing the lips
is definitely something that's tricky
definitely tricky um Oh Lupe said the
last hop about only full lips and dark
lipstick is dumb yeah I mean I think
that it's just your style i think that's
another one that's personal style okay
so we've got two more here and then
we're going to go into the glasses once
when it comes to mascara black is always
best I think we all know we can all wear
other colors as well they're saying
brown mascara na is an option for most
women don't feel colors eat fear
cobblers either Navy mascara can make
the eyes look brighter he notes and a
burgundy mascara looks dynamic on
redheads rainy would you wear burgundy
mascara that's what I want to know and
without Shannon would you wear burgundy
mask mascara on your with your red hair
i think that would look amazing i would
absolutely look amazing um I think color
mascara is definitely fun jenny says she
likes brown purple and blue mascaras and
then Krista says she loves brown
mascaras bebes beauty bar x 0 x see you
next time and jenny says I'm getting
ready to try green mask yo yeah and
Holly says she loves Navy and Jenny says
burgundy mascara looks great on blue
eyes I would imagine and Gina says she
would and then kelsey says I love black
mascara it's a classic I great he says I
would try it i never have them now i
want to look for
haha you might be able to get the
Pantone one from last year checks
affords website because it was on there
for a really long time the burgundy
mascara I don't think it ever sold out
Shannon says burgundy mascara makes my
eyes look bloodshot for some reason hmm
interesting interesting interesting all
right bye Amy are you leaving are you
just saying goodbye to the other person
all right all right now we're going to
go to last one never align your entire
eyelid mmm is that most of us learn to
line our lives only two thirds of the
way stopping before we reach the inner
corner of the eye vincent said that
severs the shape of the eye instead line
the entire I changing the thickness as
you go to emphasize your eyes if your
eyes are closed set the thickest part of
the line should be in the outer corner
if their lights that make the thickest
part of the line at the inner corner and
easy to master pencil he recommends is
the ardency Inn monster eyeliner okay
this one's personal for me I'm taking
this personally because this is that's
what I do all the time I always line my
lower lash line from the middle outward
my upper lash line I do all the way
across and then middle outward for the
for the eyeliner so I'm curious to know
what you all think in the collective
brain about this one because I feel like
that looks good on me i'm scared of
going all the way across because i feel
like it's too dramatic lupe says depends
on the individual Helen says I think it
depends on the eye shape Oh No what's up
buddy I have eight minutes yes I will
okay buddy alright entire I upper and
lower half is what Ruby said that
because as I agree it's personal depends
on how the eyes are shaped erika says
this is very personal she definitely
agrees christine says it depends on the
eye shape diana at color my obsession
says I had you have to line the bottom
and smudge off the rest of the way on
with you Jen um yeah i mean i don't know
i don't like the way that it looks all
the way across every once in one load
up but not very often I just don't like
it lisa says it's a peplum the eye shape
jenna says I need to try my eyes are
small and closed set nikki says it
depends on the I ships I think
everybody's kind of agreeing on that so
let's go ahead and we're done with Yahoo
beauty and we're going to the glasses
one because we've got seven minutes left
seven minutes where's the glasses one
all right now this is from Teen Vogue
and this article was written let's see
if it says when it was written does not
say when it was written it's just Teen
Vogue courtesy of the glasses wearing
queen of cosmetics herself miss Bobby
Brown all right here we go eyeliner is
key they say it really adds definition
from behind your lenses try gel liner on
the top and a thin stroke of powder or
liner on the bottom I agree with that I
absolutely agree with that Oh is
somebody stealing my videos again ok
coral I'll have to check that out it
happens every once while people reupload
I just have to report them a bunch of
times I'll make them disappear no one
else can um can reup no one else can
report the mix up for me I have to
report them it's ok I'll just report
them and then they'll go away thank you
I appreciate it i'll search for it i'll
find it ok um it's happened like four or
five times I'll fix it thank you ok
usually they get like five views I'm not
stressed about it all right number two
always define your brows with the shadow
that same shade as your hair color this
will ensure that your glasses don't
overpower your face I agree with that my
son's playing yahtzee over here please
excuse the sound all right totally agree
with that one number three correct your
concealer underneath the eye and in the
creases is essential the glass in your
frames can highlight under eye
discoloration and darkness I think these
are just good tips for anybody number
four waterproof mascara won't smudge on
your lenses they say apply two coats and
then number five if you have strong
frames you can get away with stronger
makeup that's interesting number six
don't let your makeup overpower your
cranes if they're delicate or nude so
choose softer colors for shadow and
create definition
with a dark liner and mascara so that's
very interesting so if you have a very
delicate frames wait yeah if you have
delicate frames it says don't let your
makeup overpower your glasses that's
interesting I had never thought of that
alright let's look are we blocking look
real okay um and then for an easy go to
look with wait for an easy look go with
bold color on your lips and just correct
your concealer mascara for your eyes put
on your glasses and you're done I like
that idea go with bold color on your
lips and just correct your concealer and
mascara easy peasy lemon squeezy you got
into we I think we all got em Stefan
Tabitha alright so that is oh there's
more there's more all right here we go
and eyeshadow color that's lighter
brighter than your own okay there are
the same things they're just go into
more detail okay when I think those are
all really good tips I like them all oh
no there's more oh my goodness there is
more okay and I should have colored it's
lighter and brighter than your frames
will stand out instead of competing with
your glasses this fun lavender shadow
complements model crystal Renee's blue
eyes and contrast beautifully with their
frames creating a look that's polished
but totally modern show you that one um
Ida says concealer before or after
foundation I like to use it before but I
don't think there's a true set rule and
I think it depends on the formulas to
like if I wear a a cream concealer and a
cream foundation I'll do the cream
concealer first but if I'm wearing a
cream foundation and a powder concealer
I'll always put the powder on top of the
cream so you always want to do liquid
first and then powders on top because if
you put the liquid on top of the powder
if you kind of cake and flake and kind
of ruin everything nikki says I still
wear shadow with my classes as you
should as you should um all right next
up make them pop bold liner with minimal
shadow looks amazing with thick
oversized for
model except SARM super mushy sharma
stuff we're strong winged liner and
intense black which makes your eyes pop
beneath her glasses when you find a
style that you love get it in several
colors white frames for example
highlight both your eye and makeup
colors making them a great choice to
pair with statement liner and she is
beautiful oh my goodness yes yes that
looks really good totally agree totally
agree they're totally where shadow with
glasses and lipstick too I think it just
depends on what you feel like you know
what you feel like doing and you're very
welcome i des hommes and ok here we go
and let's go to the next one mix and
match when you have a mix of confident
colors on your hair lips and frames keep
your eye makeup simple and clean with
only a little liner and mascara ok and
says um these names these models names
Sabourin a rocks burgundy hair and a
super bright pink lip and thin navy top
frames so shadow isn't necessary she's
got a lot else going on there you go I
don't know who can afford multiple
friends I think that um if you're going
to a very inexpensive place sometimes
you can get buy one get one half off on
frames so I'll need one pair of frames
alright and then that's it I didn't use
a really nice tips they're nice tips I
don't think that they're things you have
to follow but i do like I feel like if
she was wearing more eye shadow I think
that um this would not look good if she
was wearing like a bold eye shadow so
yes agreeing they're agreeing that all
right so these are great tips great tips
and I think we have a lot of fun today
we do have only one minute left of chat
so i want to take this time to thank you

next week chat will be taken down below
