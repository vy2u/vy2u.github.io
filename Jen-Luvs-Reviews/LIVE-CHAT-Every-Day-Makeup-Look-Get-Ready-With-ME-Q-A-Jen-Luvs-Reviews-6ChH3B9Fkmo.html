with face primer daniel says these new
videos nearly every day you're killing
again I'm trying well now i'm home i
have more time you put out more content
any better content too so I'm pretty
excited about being home and then when
the kids go to school I'll have during
the day too because my kids are crazy
they need a lot of love and a lot of
attention so sometimes during the day I
don't have as much time to do things
that I want to do I mean mom's note you
guys know I'm talking about so when
they're in school I'll be able to work a
little even more so I'm pretty excited
about that sarah says love my coffee mug
thank you so much debs one says no one
does YouTube the way you do girl
favorite youtuber oh thank you so much
and mary ann says Jenna's back the
curious fired up and all is right with
the world she also super cute shirt
thank you so much this is go couture I
get it on hautelook there about like
20-25 dollars shirt and I love goat or
it's like my go-to brand alright so this
is the bare minerals primetime
foundation primer I've been using this a
lot lately because I just got it right
before I left for my break my my family
vacation
and I really like it a one I like the
way it feels it's got like a wet feeling
it doesn't look right now it feels a
little tacky because it's drying you
know and so on a punch something he's
drawing it feels a little tacky that'll
go away I'm like just a second but it's
not particularly hydrating it's not
particularly it's not silicone e doesn't
have a slip to it but it's very nice i
like the way that it feels i need to
actually test it for reals and put
foundation I mean condition but primer
on one side of my face and not the other
and see whether it actually works should
I haven't done that yet don't do that
another day i'm not trying to add half
my makeup fall off at my son's birthday
party so all right let's see what else
Deborah says good morning I almost
missed this like these live videos oh
I'm so glad and daniel says I'm hoping
to take a makeup course in September I'm
excited so hopefully i can get my
funding for nice i hope you get to to
Daniel that's awesome alright so the
next product i'm going to use this is
the elf moisturizing foundation stick i
got this on recommendation from
emilynoel83 she did a video on her
favorite and when he's favorite elf
products when she does one of those
every once in a while and i got this
because in my if seabag coming they had
four points the hourglass stick
foundation and i wanted to compare the
elf 12 the hourglass one that's kind of
the goal so i bought the elf one and i'm
trying it out and i'm waiting for my
hips bag so that hopefully i'll be able
to do a comparison I've worn this once
and I was actually quite impressed I was
surprised because I've tried out
foundations before and did not have good
look like at all like bad luck let me
put a little under my eyes to a little
tiny bit rare alright okay alright um
Tabitha says can't stay jam but I have
to go see sis before she heads out of
town and watch later okay thank you for
dropping by Jackie says what more
strategies do you use your so Shannon
you know what I even put on moisturizer
today did not even put on moisture today
I don't even know what's happening
somebody asked me if this brush smell
like vinegar the one that I use for my
um from the Pinterest busters video this
week and it does not smell like vinegar
it does not I probably just don't have
my face now thinking about it I wasn't
only thinking and put this on but that's
looking for
he's thinking good another reason why my
face is probably shiny is because these
lights things lights are crazy you're
setting off the glue I have my studio
lights on so a little bit crazy in here
and that definitely did not help with
the shine I'll tell you that but it
didn't leave a nice light coverage let's
see if I can build it a little bit let's
see if i could build it let's see let's
see Veronica says I've been trying hi
Veronica I've been trying to use primers
SPF lately currently using armani primer
with SPF 50 how you like it kenzie says
hey I say hey so I'm not sure what to
think oh oh you like how they'll stick
to but you're not sure what to think
about it ELISA I really like that L
stick foundation only lasting it for
about six hours but it to look great for
about for those six hours that's what
we're gonna try today hey Tony how are
you good to see you i'm sad i missed he
missed the ending me up to it would have
been great to meet you reading mom's
here I washed on my brushes gestured
with you rusty at work great fantastic
and then amanda says I think that L
stick foundation might be discontinued
is on sale on their site really oh my
gosh that would be terrible i bought it
for a review because i just bought it i
bought it off the elf of the the Ulta
website natural glow no need for a
highlight well the highlights probably
happen anyway Jerry Lee nifty and drippy
another great YouTube channel I
mentioned her YouTube channel on the
pokémons go challenge I will be linking
that below the video as soon as chat is
done I completely forgot to do it we'll
skip the nose I'm completely forgot I
woke up this morning and I was just
watching the video through just make
sure everything was good and I forgot to
add the black home UT brands lists and I
forgot to add the links to the reporters
and friends collaboration so I have to
do that after chat like that's like
number one priority after chat and then
stuffing the goody bags for my son's
birthday party alright well that built
up nicely I've gotten out like a medium
coverage so that's cool very nice my
skin looks duty is a very kind word ok
Julie says couldn't be pregnancy glow no
it couldn't
nope not possible not physically
possible um all right so and actually
they've been a couple people asking me
about that recently and new not pregnant
I don't think it's physically possible
if I'm pregnant I don't know about it I
don't think that I am I don't think that
it's possible we have taken steps to
ensure that that is not possible all
right this is not a new product to me
this is the Milani face powder look at
that milani medium multitasker face
powder this is 0-3 you see the shine is
totally going oh my gosh that's crazy
I've been glowing like a diamond and
that just made a huge difference i'm
gonna look at the myself real quick and
just make sure that that did make as big
of a difference as I think it did so
actually I can't even get back to it
boooo sit um let's see lisa says happy
birthday little John thank you so much
hi in Finland BB beauty says hi it's
Britney this is my only second live chat
thank you for coming back Britney and
Dragon rebel says I'm receiving the
smoky palette from Coastal Scents just
because we review I hope you love it
it's a really good palate I don't reach
for months just because the shades don't
call me all the time and plus I get a
lot of new palettes but it is a really
nice palette Delaney's does is it me or
is the Milani be having much harder to
find in the stores where is it still
sold you know I'm not really sure um
doesn't see the S they'll carry it CBS
still carries it I haven't been to a lot
of drugstores lately to be completely
honest I've been doing a lot of online
shopping so the shine just busted back
through I feel like it's mattifying
really well I mean it's definitely not
completely mad but I don't want
completely Mac then you end up looking
weird at least I feel like I do not you
because you may not look weird but I
feel like I look weird I'm sweating a
little bit which i think is part of it
too I'm definitely sweating a little
it's warm in here so all right Walmart
carries Milani Susan says Alicia says
space bow I know it from spinning but oh
you know what I didn't put here or
something for the brows I got forget my
brows
would I just get for brows just got
something oh I got you I got you on this
okay for brows I just got my Birchbox
and I just got a sample of the new goof
proof brow pencil wait to see this thing
you did not see my Instagram snapchat II
thing on Instagram look at this thing
look at this thing look how tiny it is
this is the tiniest little sample I've
ever seen I'm like I get that the
product is expensive on its own and it's
just a sample and all that but this
isn't cost-benefit very much to make
like at all like this month this the
product goes here it's like come on you
could at least fill the little to be
thing right here it goes that there you
know it's Birchbox you get samples you
pay ten bucks that's what faithful were
but I don't know it's a little cheap
that's just what I'm saying Jill says
she's having trouble finding Milani to i
found a walmart that is very small
selection but everything looked old and
had hot new it had not had any products
just your CVS doesn't have it yeah I'm
not sure Veronica says walgreens carries
milani daniel says I don't remember did
you get the out of Saudi of moderate
moderate Renaissance ha actually Nancy
is sending me the modern renaissance
palette which is so so nice of her so I
should be getting it I wasn't planning
on buying it because the colors were not
calling to me I was and really this is
what was happening is I was trying to
justify not buying it like I really
really really really wanted it because
of the rave reviews and I really wanted
it so I was trying to talk myself out of
it I don't need it the colors aren't
calling to me like I'm not going to get
it but I've seen some of the looks
people create with that palette and I do
want it so I probably wouldn't have
bought it Nancy says it's on the way all
Thank You Nancy I appreciate you so much
and she send me a pentagram highlighter
like I can't even believe it like when
she told me like I let my heart started
beating and I like lost my breath I was
like are you kidding me are you serious
this is happening right now so i will be
getting it I don't have it yet though so
I think Nancy so much
alright so this shade is a little bit
light for me this this is the shade
number three it's a little too light but
it works I'm not sure if I like the way
that looks just because i think the
shade is a little bit light because my
hair is pretty dark but it worked I mean
am I blown away by it no I'm not blown
away by it but it works so I definitely
don't think that I would purchase this I
prefer the UM nacoo brow I really like
the cabrillo a lot this is just kind of
mad for me it's fine it's okay um Kyla's
corner have you tried Makeup Forever
water blend no I have not I have not
Daniel was the six-month aspiration
what's with six month expiration on what
I missed it and Jill says I feel the
same about the palette I may give give
in and get it yeah okay come on the
Anasazi I got distracted for a second
yes okay here we go mmm all right so
let's see what's next what's next all
right eye shadow primer I should primer
I did get a new washoe primer and it is
this the essence I heart color
intensifying I shadow primer now I've
already used this once and I did not
like it at all but i'm going to use it
again for the purposes of this video um
Delaney you know I don't know if they
still on cafepress or not the mugs I'm
not sure I haven't checked in a while if
you go to Cafe Press and you search for
Jen those reviews or what's it been
makeup you should be able to find them
it's possible yes I love big mugs and I
cannot lie seriously I can't I can't
line Nancy says I'm Anasazi Beverly
Hills says it's good for six months I
call baloney you know what I read on the
Ipsy website there's an Ipsy open is
called FC open studios and it's a
website specifically met website but
it's like a group specifically for
creators so Instagram bloggers vloggers
to go with FC and I was reading an
article that
your makeup expires you know how long
they said for eyeshadow he said three
months for eyeshadow I went look no he
woke kidding me you are kidding me like
no oh no no no no no no like no I am NOT
thrown away my eyes like my eyeshadow
palettes in three months spray will no
alcohol bre I've never heard that though
ever like from anybody and you look on
the back of the house and they say here
but I keep mine way longer I just ice
cream with a little bit alcohol I've
never had a problem so I don't know it
just can you imagine throwing away all
your eyeshadow palettes after three
months like really that's not gonna
happen so but anyway back to this
eyeshadow primer this crease Tommy
really really fast and we're gonna see
the crisis today especially with the
heat it probably will crease because my
skin heals very moist right now very
very moist and everybody's laughing at
the three months um the other thing is
is it it says khullar intensifying it's
not as mattifying at or as it doesn't
mute out discolorations like some of the
other primers that i have like i use the
mac paint pot and penalty for that I
used Urban Decay seating for that and
this just does not do that um yeah
chiquita says this is so bad primer yeah
it's really not good but I just bought
it so i figured i would show it to you
just because i'm daniel says oh yeah i
can just imagine people buying there's
natasha and busier kaulitz every three
months I know right I know all right um
I did bring this out in just in case I
got this bareMinerals eyeshadow and true
gold in that bare minerals mystery kit
and it's so pretty I think I might use
that along with if you have fault if you
follow me on periscope you've already
seen me get ready with this I apologize
I need to keep trying it and keep trying
and keep trying and keep trying it to
make sure that I'm feeling the way that
I'm feeling about it I did use this for
the look for what's up in makeup but
then I had to layer things on top of it
because it just wasn't intense enough
for what's up and make up it just wasn't
it wasn't enough it's good for everyday
makeup though so i thought i would use
it today and see how
lasted without putting a whole lot of
extra on top of it so I'm glowing
because it's hot it's so funny and also
I still still have remnants of a tan a
little bit I am not pregnant I am not
pregnant this is really funny I'm I
don't want to have if I had another kid
I would be okay with it but that is not
the intention like tues plenty for me
two's enough oh no I don't know if I can
handle third kids I could I would if I
got pregnant I would but that's
definitely not the intention alright
moving on let's see okay where is my
fluffy crease brush hold on fluffy
praise for sure I'm not organized my
brushes since I got back this one might
be too fluffy this is the Sigma tapered
blending is the e-40 it may be a little
too fluffy we'll see i'm going to use
the shade guru right here um okay we're
going to put that all up in the crease
Colette Milani eye primer or the knicks
milk if you can afford it okay nice you
can't afford the Urban Decay primer
potion and enigma I don't have the
Enigma one I have eaten by heard really
good things about enigma the in the
Lonnie I primer I need to re-up on it I
bought it ahead for a really short
period of time and then I don't know
what happened to it I think I've to put
to the gym and left to get the gym like
a year ago so i think i need to re-up on
that the next types of milk is fab but
it is white though so you have to be
kind of careful with that with the white
because the white can be a little harsh
you have to really cover it you know
which usually isn't a problem for me but
you see how easy that went on and its
really pigmented look really nice and
I've never bought any ultime cup before
this so I really wanted to try the
Brandon want to try the brand for a
while and this just kind of gave me an
excuse so Teresa says good morning jen i
purchased the two julep kits from old
after watching your video i'm really
excited to try them oh I hope you love
them
I hope you like them I really like them
Jill was doing a really good job with
their stuff recently like I have been
very impressed you can tell they just
put a lot of heart into their into what
they do and they just really want to do
well you know let the improvement in the
mascara I could not believe how much
more I like though Joel what mascara I
went on so easy so easy jenna says I am
late catch me up hi Jenna it's good to
see you Jenna we're just getting ready
girlfriend we're just getting ready you
said he says I hate to say it but I had
the same thought about you being
pregnant oh i know and i think it was
because of the the tan I had a tan when
I got back and it's funny because I
gained some weight too so I think that's
part of it is that but that's just well
I went off of my birth control I will
tell you that that is a private thing
but I will confess that to you I did go
off my birth control but John is John
should not be able to have children
anymore he took care of that so I'm
hoping that is not the case but I even
thought about for a second like wow but
then I got my friend and we're all good
so I'm hoping that it stays that way
alright so let's go into on the lid
trying to find a brush I just gave you a
lot of personal information I was a plan
on doing that but this live stuff yo my
friends you know sometimes these things
especially when you send you ask me
questions please send in a chat all the
time all right did you sing it is one of
the facebook um admins so we chat all
the time alright so lets you know what i
want a really light lid let's go with
polished all over the lid marina says
the what and while i shadow primer is
just as good as my Urban Decay primer
you know from me the each other the
fergie one the fur key one is not
fabulous for me it's not bad but it's
definitely not my favorite but I've
heard other people disagree with me on
that one
All Right see if I wanted to do
clickbait I would change the name of
this video to am i pregnant but I'm not
going to do that I won't do that the old
zap is awful I haven't really used it
much you know when I use the old to app
I use it when um when I'm in the store
and I need the coupon that's really the
only time I ever use the old to app
don't use it for much else everyone
smile check products on there but not
something I'm on very often all right I
like it I like it a lot now we need some
other things happening now we've got
like a nice base there yo dub says a wet
and wild primer is amazing the photo
finished 10 haven't tried that one and
dragon rebel says after i got the kat
von z palette i went i want i'm going to
i missed it oh no i'm going to get the
foot going to focus on getting singles i
want nice sounds good Oh bloop bloop
hold on a second I just lost it I lost a
chat hold on hold on hold on ok there we
go ok Lorena are you talking about you
can't download it oh you talk about the
Ceph says sometimes the app is faster ok
show me all to app I'm thinking and you
can't download ulta app in Mexico Lorena
good morning Amanda carolyn says if you
have acne prone skin do not use the
two-faced hangover primer it smells
wonderful but it'll break you out that
is very interesting because I did get
that a sample of that and I don't know
what I did with it but I really liked it
when I tried it so that's really good to
know says it shouldn't include new gifts
with purchase with the new items oh no
on a minute I lost your train of thought
Stefan that 10 Lorena says she can't oh
that stinks Joanna said good morning
shout out to jayla am i shouting out to
jayla jello what's up too high said
she's gonna try that primer all right
let me put on a little bits let's do you
know what I'm going to do I'm gonna do a
little bit of mitten this like like very
toned shimmery
I want to pop that in the outer corner
see what happens one thing i did mention
that i definitely think this is a huge
negative of this palette is that there
are no super deep shades i wish that she
had gotten rid of one of these three
shades here even one of these four
shades here and done a really deep brown
the really deep brown matte would have
been super fab I think that would have
been really smart of her but I don't
know oh no I think there's just too many
of these orange shades here and then she
really needed the deep color in this
palette really bad that's my biggest
critique of this palette so far but the
shades the one really nice day I mean
you saw how they go on then go on really
nice and I'm just taking this to the
outer third and then up into the crease
I'm almost done I don't do a lot of
steps for my eye shadow looks like at
all I don't I'm not that good at it to
be honest what I want to start doing is
looking at like Instagram makeup looks
and seeing if I can recreate them
without any directions because I
guarantee they will be like five steps
they may not look the same but nobody
like buzz dubs because I don't know how
to do some of the fancy stuff that
people do all right oh I started do
something without talking to you this is
the Virgo right here this white one
right here favorite palette of all time
that's a tough one favorite palette of
all time oh no probably the chief a
chocolate bar palette probably that's my
desert island pellet I'm going to go in
like a quarter of the way in on this
light shade and then there's no matte
cream shade in here the closest is fab
right there so we're going to use a
little bit of fab on a really fluffy
brush and hopefully it's not too deep
just to kind of blend out the brow bone
a little bit and then our i shadow is
going to be done um
mere um I want to say this right
marinela says don't worry sometimes I
take almost an hour to do my makeup my
eyes take up most of that time they do
take a long time it's true Julie says do
you think she had any part in picking
out the shadow colors I would hope she
did well and it's a very missjenfabulous
shade range like she's blonde so these
warm colors look gorgeous on her um I
didn't watch the video where she
announced it but I would hope that they
would give her choice over what shades
were in her palate oh ho all right I
think we might be done with the
eyeshadow so it went oh yay I just
sounded out marinella I just had to
sound it out good trace says my eyes are
one shadow look every day and that's
really the best way Tracy not trace
Tracy I got you Trent ck got it um one
Shadow look and I need to do more one
shadow looks I just can't stop I start
and then I can't stop carolyn says I
want the misjudged palette still and
honestly like I'm really enjoying
working with it what I'm concerned about
is the lasting power but we shall see on
that we're going to test that out today
I'll probably do an update on my
Instagram I'm really getting into the
Instagram snapchat copy thing if you
guys haven't jumped on that I have a lot
more people that I'm keeping in touch
about an Instagram that on snapchat so
Instagram is a lot easier for me
personally so i'll update you guys later
on there and kind of show you how this
looked um you're Sarah not James that's
right thank you Sarah for reminding me
about that I appreciate it Jackie says
what about the bare mineral show I think
I'm gonna let it be I don't know because
I kind of want to test the this without
anything what i can do is i can swatch
it but i don't I just decided I really
wanted to use it but I decided in my
brain that I think I'm just going to UM
oh my gosh it's so pretty though like
for reals for reals are you kidding me
mmm I think I just lost my breath I
think I just lost my breath so pretty
maybe we'll put on the lower lash line
that's what we'll do that's how we'll
get away with it
redhead for trouble says I've really
gotten into snapchat it's really fun yes
instead says your IV that came out
perfect thank you so much and carolyn
says have been using the bunny palette a
lot too dog man is your favorite shade
dog man is a really nice shades are
really nice shape alright let's use
because I cannot not use this I'm even
just say I'm gonna take it off the
swatch right now I gotta dip it down a
little bit too we're going to use a
little bit of the bare mineral shade
which I will tell you what the name of
it is in just a minute we'll do it on
the lower lash line that way it doesn't
interfere with what I've got going on in
my lid I can still test missjenfabulous
pallet on the lid that was cool like
that I like it a lot and gives it that
little birthday Blair okay eyeliner
Lorena says i buy only all matt
patterson powelton use amber rush when
you want shimmer amber rush is a great
shade if you don't know amber rush if
the Loreal infallible oh my gosh it's
gorgeous that one an iced latte or my
two favorites um Lee Anne says it gives
it's time to get an Instagram account
you don't have an Instagram Lee and oh
my gosh yes oh you know what I forgot to
use concealer why need concealer today
probably a little bit prolly should i
already put powder on my face favorite
inner corner highlights I like mary-lou
manizer if I had to tell you a favorite
inner corner highlight i would say
mary-lou manizer now I use my concealer
finger for eyeshadow this is the next
dark circle concealer I've been using
this a lot lately this is a really nice
concealer for dark circles for me I
don't get a lot of blemishes so i can't
speak to that but it's that salmon color
so i really like way that it looks my
face just ate up that powder so i don't
think it's going to make that big of a
difference as far as the powder under
the eyes see what that looks like one
side mom mom mom chris is here yeah she
made this morning yay um jenna says she
doesn't have a snapchat yes favorite
highlights had so many favorite
highlights oh no man I mean Mary Lou
just keep popping into my head I love
the PB&amp;amp;J pal I haven't used it in a hot
minute but i'd be like it
one thing that's nice about using
concealer after eyeshadow is I can kind
of bring the concealer up and cover up
any mistakes that I made with my
eyeshadow as long as my eyeshadow is not
to super dark here we go I didn't go
down in the Triangle very much on my
cheeks is I'm not trying to go all like
glam guru today and I'll go down my
cheeks a little bit Mary Lou is the best
Cheryl says I love good the bombs
mary-lou manizer it's pretty awesome
daniel says I've been trying to use
Instagram more and it's mostly baking
and food they'll be on my page nice
that's awesome buddy yeah is super Fab
Daniel is amazing Daniel is one of my
pair loves we cook together all the time
and he helps me with my cooking all
right um fillet says Jen fabulous has
dark brown shouldn't be in the says the
dark brown shouldn't be in a natural
palette strongly disagree because um
maybe for really pale girls but kind of
need some dark Browns for the darker
girls for deep skin girls kind of needed
some darker Browns strongly disagree on
that one and I'm not a dark-skinned girl
and I like dark Browns and my natural
pellets so there I do love
missjenfabulous it's her palette she can
do with it what she wants but I have to
disagree oh absolutely Daniel he said
thank you can't wait to try the new
world techniques sponges steph says I'm
going to be brave brave a purple
highlight today oh my goodness you're
going to a concert get it girl I'm just
putting some of that um that Milani
powder on my concealer yeah I'll do
eyeliner 1033 already holy moly jenna
says I disagree always wear dark Browns
but you know what she's very
fair-skinned and she's blonde so I can
see she could get away with it but when
you're making a palette it's supposed to
read
multiple people of multiple skin tones
you have to take that into consideration
as well so but on the plus side i'm
really really liking the palette a lot
really liking the palette um and I don't
know if that's true that Jen said that
from my point of view cuz I didn't see
the video so I'm not trying to hate on
Jen at all I'm not trying again I really
like Jen a lot i love her channel um
let's see still waiting for the peach

feel it broke the internet returns this
November so nobody talks about the glow
palette yeah I'm looking forward to

it once once the gift out to all of the
influencers all of the instagramers and
the beauty youtubers and it'll it'll
it'll get out people talk about it um
Snape's honey said the sneak peek I saw
had a tile pattern of bronze peachy and
pink highlight nice melissa says she
knows that joke Nancy said totally have
it on my wall when I was a teacher yeah
it's a good one it's a good one alright
eyeliner because we're starting to run
out of time here I can't believe it so
this is the essence super fine eyeliner
pen when I did the Revlon eyeliner pen
video this was one of the most
recommended drugstore eyeliner pens and
I am loving it I've used it a couple of
times I'll show you the tip in a second
I won't do that but I already started so
good I can't go back now ok
alright so there's a tip home put up
here here's the tip looking good looking
good it's very black it's a little bit
shiny it's not super mad but he's not
super shiny either I think paint check
pika peach I think summer though yeah I
think that was what the original plan
was on the peach palette was that it was
supposed to be like a summer palette but
because people went crazy over it
they're bringing it back alright I'm
going to try to do my wing on I met can
I put this here is that going to mess up
the camera angle here I say a little bit
it's a little weird little bit weird I'm
trying to do like my wing and I can't
put my mirror over there and show you
guys at the same time so I usually just
stretch my eye a little bit and then I
just kind of zip it up and then I close
my eye a little bit and I try to connect
it like a triangle like that that's how
i do my Wang that's how I did my wedding
and then where do the other side real
quick and then I'll check your comments
all right here we go here we go bonbon
the money so I can already see that the
shimmery champagne e kinds of colors see
how it's not like pump know if you can
see but it's not like there is a great
separation between the colors there I
can see it when I look up close but
lecture filming and stuff I don't think
this palette is intense enough but for
everyday wear ooh all the fingerprints
on there mmm very aware i think that
it's fine least so far mmm flicking it
up that's what I think the hardest part
of doing the wing is is that little
flick thing oh I missed this I miss oh
oh oh oh oh total fail total fare
getting worse getting worse getting
worse abort mission abort mission okay
somehow i magically kept a little bit of
wing there i wiped off really easily so
that's kind of good but then kind of not
good in it i wonder whether it's just
going to wipe off my
later super easy to use though I said to
be more careful mmm there we go to a
match yup much pretty good I feel like
you like with with eyeliner with winged
eyeliner the eat the hardest part is
just doing it like practicing and doing
it my face is so stinkin shun me what is
that I don't even know why tie them now
can't Chrissy says I can't wing my eyes
reject wags VCB says is my my bronzer
blush what is my a bronzer blood
Veronica what is going on is my a bunch
of blush I don't know I'm sure it was
autocorrect Chucky too fast whatever
sorry I wanted renewable or do colleen
says I money no by until the holidays
waiting to get the Mario oh yeah the
Mario palette yes makeup by Mario Wendy
says christie i avoid wings because it
takes time to me to match it yeah does
take time definitely I'm missing some
things I can't do bling I let her see my
life Susan says Rosie says oh snap
that's exactly what happens to you and I
look like a panda no right and then make
Sabrina the makeup mom another YouTube
channel says yes the abh Mario palette
yeah well see what happened that I think
it's going to do really well because all
the youtubers are gonna blow it up and
buddy's gonna be like yes I'm really
hoping that I'm sure that'll be good
he's not a stodgy college over all over
again I know Alma I don't know what in
the world is going on with my face today
I don't know what's going on I just got
a powder powder and powder and power
alright we're going to try today I don't
know what nance was thinking on this but
they're coming out with a double stacked
mascara they said they sent it I want to
be that sense me I got it in with FC
points and instead a little car that
it's coming out it's brand new but this
is like such an old format not old but
like year old format where you do it's
like the unique where you do the mascara
you do the fibers and then you do more
mascara and I honestly have never met
a person that doesn't sell unique it
really likes this format so i put it up
to you i'm wondering if there's anybody
it doesn't sell unique it likes this
format while you put on the mascara you
put on the fibers and you put on my
mascara I bet there isn't anybody well
there might be somebody there's always
somebody it likes it so do i had the
modern sent palette nobody's on the way
to my house thanks to Nancy Delaney says
reminds me of the double and in my
drugstore mascaras it's a little
different in that you talking about like
the L'Oreal double extend that one has a
primer or it's like white and then after
the primer you put on mascara with this
you put on the black like this and then
Jose I'd do it right some probably have
like 100 people tell me I'm not doing it
right all by chrisy thanks for coming
and then it's got these fiber things and
you put the fibers on this and the
fibers are supposed to extend your
lashes and it deming looks like it's
extending them right now I look like I
have a small animal growing on my lids
ooh I don't know if you can see that
there's little fiery guys on my eyes
okay I know news for me and then you
take this this is the tricky part and
you put this on but I feel like that the
second coat of mascara is where it falls
short because i feel like the second
coat of mascara really takes off a lot
of the fibers and the end up just
getting mixed back into the tube and
then after a while the mascara ends up
just having a bunch of little flakies in
it and clumpy and just look so i'm not a
fan not a fan at all yeah kenzie says
um in my opinion ich is terrible dragon
says I like the result of 3d lashes but
really grab for them carolyn says a
return the kat von d serpentina palette
her product parts are going downhill no
don't tell me that really oh that makes
me sad it makes me really sad um keep
real cam says I don't sell it I like it
but not every day the gel mascara
irritates my eyes gotcha and in
christmas says Jen could you do a review
of the new touch and soul medallist
liquid foil and glitter eye shadow dues
everyone's raving about that i'm not
sure if i'm getting yet the touch and
soul really cuz i haven't heard much
about touching soul um of course i hear
about it on the show when stuff comes
out off to look into that and see how
much they are could just spend a bunch
of money so i'll have to see how much
they are I have to like organize my
video life and make sure that I'm not
committing to too many videos because I
just talked to some people about some
other things like someone had asked me
to do a room tour and set up for filming
says thing about doing that and like a
couple other things people are
requesting that was kind of like yeah I
could do that so I might be over booking
myself alright let's try the fibers
Linda says your voice like Emily Noel I
think that's her name I love Emily
Noelle she's like my YouTube idol so
that is a huge compliment to me huge
all right there we go Kat Von D holiday
pie looks promising oh I didn't see it
yet oh I need to look that up Joanna
says they're 20 for dollars 95 different
ones oh I'd lost track of the train of
thought nancy says gen touch and soul is
all sold out actually sent you on your
package for you I you did not Nancy
Nancy is like my guardian angel over
here hey it sure I'm trying all this up
are you serious like I just got all
funky and my stomach again oh my gosh
Thank You Nancy goodness gracious I'm
freaking out right now until he's
freaking out but if I forgot too much
I'll get my sterile all over my upper
lid all right so overall this mascara is
not impressive unfortunately I wanted to
impress it but it's not um let's say
Tiffany says you do your wedding well
Tiffany I need to watch your video
Tiffany gone what was the video at
bookmark yesterday oh you're honest
thought it was it on estas in beverly
hills of some somehow it you got and i
wanted to watch it I wanted to watch it
and i bookmarked it and i can't remember
what it was um they says can you please
please subscribe to my channel are you a
beauty channel you don't look like a
beauty channel I don't think that that
we're the same demographic as far as
where women like makeup so I don't know
Veronica says that people want to
subscribe to you fine his name is a
money if you want to subscribe to him
Veronica says Jen if you could collab
with a brand on a pallet which company
would be your dream Holly two-faced
two-faced I wouldn't mind doing
something a press palette with naked
cosmetics and that would be amazing cuz
they have a loose glitter palette nice
litter like things that I love if we
could get a press palette with naked
cosmetics I would die I would die but to
face is probably my favorite brand
overall Kevin he's amazing too Julie
says i love Kat Von D and I'm so excited
to see what she has coming out I've been
saving my ulta points41 she once she had
one really good palate choice yes Seth
says the shape tape is nice but it isn't
water
I found out oh you said it and it still
ranks I've heard really good things
about that shape tape Tiffany says if
you use iMovie do you think final cut is
easy i have not used imovie i switched
straight from sony vegas on a pc to
Final Cut Pro and I've just been
watching YouTube tutorials on things and
the first day I was kind of panicking
and freaking out but I i I'm learning it
pretty quickly it just you know I feel
like I never use iMovie so I can't
really compare the two Veronica says she
wants the shape tape too and then Susan
says i love the kat von d 2 i'm still
sad i didn't get her last holiday hell
yeah the last Hollypaw it was pretty
amazing mara mirela says the holiday kat
von d palette has all the colors in the
wrong order and the circle and the
rectangle pans and the same palette
makes my skin crawl Oh yikes ok shape
tape kenzie is the the new two-faced
concealer that everybody's raving about
alright what else do I need to do oh my
goodness one in ten minutes left holy
moly ok let's do cheeks ulta velvet
blush I've used it once and I loved it I
could not believe how much I liked it I
look are you kidding the hold up are you
kidding me you've been hiding this for
me I'm going to use this really fluffy
Coastal Scents brush because it is kind
of pigmented and I'm not trying to have
clown face and if you have a really
pigmented brush brush brush and brush or
way too close together you have a very
pigmented blush one way to avoid clown
face is to use a very fluffy brush
because you think about how many
bristles it has the more bristles the
more product it will pick up that looks
show stick and pretty oh my gosh oh my
gosh carolyn says a monarch palette by
Kat Von D's wonderful I don't own that
one I own the chrysalis Oh shake cakes
by tart tiny says I'm sorry Thank You
Tanya what did I say I said tart in my
brain I must have said something else
and that's hard did I say toothpaste was
I met tart thank you for correcting me
because I don't want to say the wrong
thing Jenna
Szczesny vida loca still makes me mad I
slept on it all Mellie says I want the
tart shaped tape my next in saluda by
everybody is raving about it that just
went on like a second dream I hope it
lasts maybe hope it lasts okay and then
for highlight we are going to use a
highlight today even though I really
don't need it we're gonna highlight
anyway this is the elf illuminating
college I love the contour palette if
you've been around my channel for a
while you know which one contour palette
so I'm going to use the highlighting
palette i use this the other day and i
really liked it i think i'm going to use
this one today right there see where is
my fan brush so you don't know oh i
forgot to use my new julep brush i meant
to use this I got this in my doula
prescription and I meant to use this and
I didn't use it man oh well I can't use
it for highlight is too big same what
did I do with my fan brush on here is
cool sit on my desk make sure there's
nothing on here alright so let's use
this one over here in the corner like a
Goldie kind of shade here and we'll
highlight a little bit mm-hmm that is so
stinking pretty it's definitely a very
it's not a subtle highlight it's a
poppin highlight so if you like pop and
highlights this might be for you that is
so pretty oh my ok and then for lips I'm
running out a room here out of time here
Annette says the blush looks so pretty I
know right lists as I just watched my
morphe sponge and it's bleeding pink
it's you said it's bleeding pick I think
you need pink maybe I don't own any of
those it's good to know that it does
that anna says have you tried to make up
revolution highlighter on white pink
blush chefs no I haven't I haven't I do
like makeup revolution stuff overall
though for the most part they're
actually they're kind of hit and miss
for me mostly hit though um show says
cheeks on fleek gin oh I know Loretta
says they don't like pop and highlights
and you are not alone you're not alone
this is the ultimate stick in blooming
and if one is a couple times and I
really like it a lot I'm so surprised
and it goes on pretty smooth it's got a
little bit of a drag to it but in that
pretty it gets really o cake it's got a
nice little shine to it and it's really
pretty the we're down on it was really
nice to scent is very very mild makeup
be sent but it's super super mild super
mild Lorena says yes 43s texture Andrew
