the makeup chat I am very excited to be
here and hanging out with you all this
morning you guys know how much I love
live chat I know not everyone loves a
live chat format where I go back and
forth and speak with the community if
this isn't your cup of tea totally get
it plenty of other content on the
channel that you can enjoy no need to
leave me mean messages because I'm tired
of the main messages lately I've been
getting a lot so um so anyway yeah so
live chat is really really fun because
you not only get my opinion on things
but you also get the opinion of hundreds
of people also in the chat which is
super super cool and I think that's way
better than just my opinion I've been
doing a live chat for a really long time
really long time so pretty much since
YouTube made it an option to do live
chat and I figured out how to do it so
today we are gonna be doing some really
we're gonna kind of multitask today
because I have a couple of Beauty tags
that were done by new friends of mine
relatively new friends of mine Samantha
and I have been friends for a little
while and then Lisa I just found through
Samantha so very excited to get to know
her a little bit better and they
developed a couple of tags that I
thought we would do together I was
supposed to take my son to a birthday
party right after chat like we had to
leave 11 o'clock but my husband has now
been dragged into taking him but before
that all happened I got all my makeup
ready and I figured we do a getting
ready with me just with my everyday
makeup look since I was going to this
birthday party I couldn't I didn't feel
comfortable with doing anything crazy
especially since this would been the
first time I would have met some of
these parents and you know showing up in
full glam to a birthday party where
you've never met anybody before is kind
of crazy I'm like messing with my hair I
don't know why I need to leave it alone
I'm getting this like V right here it's
very weird like this weird V in my hair
so let's see part this way and then go
this way so that maybe we can cover up
my weird little V I don't know I hate my
hair looking at the bottoms of my hair
this morning and almost like it is time
to get my hair cut and done so we're
gonna multitask today we're gonna do a
getting ready with
and we're gonna be answering these
beauty community kinds of tag questions
that I think are really really cool so
we've got did I finish saying it we've
got the YouTube rewind tag by Samantha

December and then the beauty community

comment too Bobby that she needs oh
thank you you guys are already toner go
back and come in okay so we're gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna start with the
YouTube rewind tag while I get ready see
if I can post this up in front of me
I've got my notes here so that I
wouldn't be stumbling over my words and
I'm gonna put on the to face priming and
peachy primer and while we do this this
was in my twenty seventeen favorites
video if you haven't seen that yet I
absolutely love it so the first question
is what was the first video you posted
in 2017 and the first video I posted was
what Sapa makeup on January 1st
it was an abbreviated version of what's
up in makeup because it was the the
weekend of new year so we did an
abbreviated version so that was actually
technically the first video that I put
up to you all but the first video that I
posted like because it actually was
uploaded the day before like the night
before but the first video I put up in
2017 was my color green queen of hearts
review I uploaded that on January 1st
and it published to you on January 2nd
so that was my first video so
technically I fell in love with coloured
raine last year well in 2016 too is that
two years ago now at this point I guess
I don't know it would have been December
of 2016 but there were hewn of 26
team number two is do you have a
favorite video you created in 2017 and
yes I do I have a favorite video I was
so proud of this video it didn't even
get a ton of views compared to a lot of
my stuff but they looked my lorac
Pirates of the Caribbean video I
absolutely loved that video I put in so
many little fun editing things into that
like that thumbnail is me as a pirate
and then I've got like pirate music
going on in the background and I've got
like like little pirates sound effects
and I've got a little pirate ship that
floats by at one point I mean it is the
cutest little video and I was so proud
of that video and I don't I got I
remember getting less views than I had
hoped it would Suzanne wants to know do
you know anything about the ELSA palette
from Beauty creations cosmetics I don't
I'm sorry I don't I wish I did
oh by the way this is the sweet cotton
up pour BB for cover BB cream by Holika
Holika this is another one that I talked
about in my Korean beauty favorites of
the year it's a fantastic very light
coverage BB cream it only comes in I
think two or three shades but you can
always use one of those foundation drop
things to either lighten or darken
chances are if you're if you're really
really really fair like Kourtney from
fair necks if you're really fair like
her you'll probably need lightning drops
but if you are like umm Taylor from that
Tayla you might be okay with their
lightest shade alright
trying to punch myself in the face real
quick while I'm thinking about the next
question sapphire-blue mua says hello
from Michigan I love your videos oh
thank you so much it must be so cold in
Michigan it is freezing here it is about
six degrees outside I think it is really
cold really really really cold so I
can't imagine I saw someone was in
Alberta can't imagine how cold it must
be in Alberta
Suzanne said the Pirates video is your
first I saw oh yeah I loved that video I
had so much fun editing that video and
plus I just love the products absolutely
love them okay so let's move on to the
next question which is do you have a
video you made that was outside of your
comfort zone no wait yeah where's my
okay there's the answers it skipped down
a little bit
video outside of my comfort zone well
what the K actually when my Korean
Beauty series I felt like was outside my
comfort zone in that I didn't know
anything about Korean Beauty when I
first started that series so I feel like
I was expecting it to be a little more
gimmicky than it ended up being so
that's kind of where the what the K name
came from is that the first original
Korean beauty products that I saw were
all like kind of gimmicky you know like
the Holika Holika stuff and some of the
Tony moly stuff was you know real cutesy
and you know like really like the stuff
that like the pig pornos pig face stuff
and all that so that's kind of where
what the cake came from and then I
realized as I did the series more that
there's some really like legit k-beauty
stuff that it's not just about you know
the gimmick of it of some of it you know
the the pig poor mask and stuff some of
the stuff that it's kind of a lot of
marketing that a lot of the majority of
Korean beauty is actually very amazing
when it comes to the innovation that's
in it and the quality of ingredients so
that was really out of my comfort zone
because I didn't know a lot about Korean
Beauty when I started and so that was
that was something and then I did a live
chat if you were there you have to tell
me 32 degrees in Alberta really that's
it I thought it'd be lower than that 52
degrees in Dallas oh my gosh it's so
cold here I don't know what's up with
that but yeah my I did a live chat
another one that was you know really
very uncomfortable for me this is the
router by glossier I learned to do this
to get the powder out it's a very odd
way to get it out but it was about
cosmetic ingredients I was so
uncomfortable doing that video I did it
because it was by request but I still
feel like there's so much I don't know
about cosmetic ingredients because I
wasn't professionally trained I've read
some books and I've done a lot of
googling but I'm not professionally
trained in cosmic ingredients so what I
have to go on is just kind of the
reputable sources that I've read but I'm
not professionally trained I've tried to
get labs to take me on kind of as an
intern where I would show up once a week
well one lab because we don't have many
labs where they would take me on like
once a week to come in and just kind of
follow around and help them you know
with anything and kind of for free just
let me hang out so they could like teach
me stuff that didn't work out I thought
I thought I'd try it didn't really work
but I would like to be more
professionally trained in ingredients
but that made me really uncomfortable
because I felt like I still do a lot of
googling and you know I didn't want to
be caught on the spot and then look like
a complete idiot because I didn't know
something that I probably should have
known Julia wants to know what the
mirror is I get asked that all the time
because this mirror is so cool this is
by simple human and it's just I don't
know it says be two one zero eight zero
on the bottom
oh no but this is a great mirror get it
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond with your 20% off
coupon and it's a lot less less
expensive big gold powder brush is from
Tarte amber this is a Tarte brush I got
it in a set a while back yes this is a
marble Beauty Blender what else did I
use the concealer brush that I use is
the pro press full coverage precision
brush by Sephora brand this is a great
concealer brush I think that's all I've
used so far yes okay so let's go ahead
into brows this is the Kris Anna and
cosmetics brow pomade in dark
Brown this is a lot like the Anastacio
dip Brown except for it is it's well I
guess it's it's very very very creamy it
dries down really nicely but it's in
tense like if you like intense Instagram
brows this is the product This Is It
this is a moto metallics brush it's just
look an angled brush it doesn't say oh
just says brow on the side you see Bobby
says I love you Jen I love you back
girlfriend did you get my my response to
one of your comments last night cuz you
commented something and I responded I
want to make sure you get that oh and
then the last one kind of video that I
was I know I'm all over the place this
morning I hope you're okay with my being
jumping all over the place if not this
video is probably them all over the
place
Oh Chris Ann Ann is here hey Chris Anna
yeah I'm using your brow product it's
very very nice it's it's a really good
product it's just really intense and the
other one is the everyday people
tutorials that I started doing they are
way out of my comfort zone because I
know very well that I am NOT great at
makeup like I feel like I've improved a
lot like if you knew where I started I
think that people would be like yeah
good for you but like people expect me
to like jump in and be Manny anyway and
I'm just not you know like that's just
I'm I'm not professionally trained in
this stuff
and honestly I don't watch a lot of
tutorials and I'm realizing it's been a
very humbling experience over the past
few days after doing the color drain
video where I messed up I captaining in
the video where I messed up on camera a
couple times I kept it in and I knew
people were gonna comment you know that
you suck at makeup and everything but I
didn't realize how many people were
gonna tell me how much I suck and how
mean people were gonna be about it so it
was a very humbling experience and so I
I'm committed to in 2018 watching more
makeup tutorials and trying to improve
and be better because you know that's
part of the game that's part of what the
game I'm playing and if I'm not playing
that part
that's not good but like I feel like
even my monk my brow game has gotten a
lot better my contour my cheeks but my
eye shadow game I haven't really worked
on a whole lot cuz I just assumed I was
just okay I was good enough at it so um
you know let me say what I miss okay
I mean I don't think I suck at makeup
but I definitely feel like there's
where's the places that I can improve so
I'm gonna go ahead and brush this out
because as you can see there it's very
intense and you just want the littlest
bit on your brush and then I kind of
kind of stamp it on and then I just
gently pull it through because it's it's
very intense but the wear time on it is
really good and the color match is
really nice for me for this color so I
do very much like it dawn says ten
degrees in New York City oh my goodness
so Danielle says we are real consumers
who appreciate real reviews a good
makeup artist can do a lot but I like
seeing a regular consumer feels and
that's kind of how I've always felt
about it you know that not everybody has
this insane makeup skill and I've always
felt like I kind of represented those
people but at the same time you know
knowing how to properly apply something
that helps me to do better reviews so
you know I get it I get it so I'm always
looking to be better there I think
there's a there's a there's a line
between wanting somebody to be better
and wanting someone to be somebody else
you know that this person does this so
you should do that because I want you to
be like this person versus I just think
your channel could improve in this way
by doing X Y &amp;amp; Z you know what I mean so
I really like that me trying to be
somebody else is not going to happen
because I'm never gonna be I'm never
gonna like I don't want to have a
different background with the lights and
everything behind me I don't want to do
the paint splatter with me winking at
you in cartoon version you know I don't
want to do that because that's not me I
think that's great for the people that
do do those things that's great that
that's them but that's not me I want to
be me
you know what I mean so Shirley says
genuine not anyone else but I like that
you were you thank you and I think
enough people like that I'm me so I'm
cool with that but anyway that was
really off topic that was about my
everyday people tutorials because I am
self-conscious about doing tutorials
took me a long time to do tutorials and
do demos in my reviews because I was so
self-conscious of my um my makeup skills
it's a sore spot because I like to be
really good at things and when you're
not really good at something it's it's
hard to present I'm not great at
something to the world for critique you
know I mean so city of the cylon I am
over the 1-hour application routine I'm
over the contour in Highlandtown
looks yeah I know it yeah I'm totally
with you totally with you this this
whole routine would probably if I wasn't
talking to anybody take me about 30
minutes to do oh just Val says my
favorite thing about you is that you are
a former teacher I'm a physic teacher oh
that's so cool all right next question I
should go back into these questions
number four is what video did you post
on your birthday I posted a makeup
minute on my birthday which was June 8th
was when I turned 39 you know it was a
Smashbox creating transform masterclass
and KL polishes summer sneak peeks is
what I posted on my birthday the first
like real video like my videos that you
know aren't makeup minutes I mean
they're real videos but ones that like
are me in them so there was a whatsapp
and makeup news posted on June 11th
which was Urban Decay Naked heat was
released Jacqueline Jacqueline's in hot
water I don't know what Jacqueline had
done Jaclyn hill and then the Too Faced
was sneaking that they were
collaborating with Britney Spears which
we haven't heard anything about maybe
we'll hear about that in 2018 and then
before that on June 6 11 awesome beauty
brands you need to try Plus spotlighting
their best products that was a really
good video I liked that video a lot all
right what did you what oh did you find
a new channel or creator in 2017 that
you love oh my gosh so many new creators
that I love in 2017 that's why I did
that spotlight video where it was called
the truth can YouTube youtubers can keep
it real something like that that was the
video where I kind of highlighted a lot
of those channels
of course Samantha March is one that I
found you know
Georgia Harris and makeup struggles and
live loves her makeup I might have found
live the year before though I can't
remember but but anyway no maybe not
maybe not I don't know but I found so
many really good channels in 2017 there
seems to be this cluster of new amazing
channels coming up you know like the
channels I just mentioned that are like
awesome you know keep your eye out for
those channels that are coming up man
cuz they're good they're good
Kendra says all June Athens the day I
was adopted oh that's cool so it's kind
of a birthday for both of us sort of
okay so next up did you find any new
brands you loved in 2017 coloured raine
was the big one that was the big one
that I tried and really loved I have the
liquid lipsticks that I tried that I
really love I've tried more of their
eyeshadows again I tried the this is
Urban Decay's eaten by the way this is
an old oldie but a goodie I showed a
primer but um but yeah I tried some of
their singles I tried some more their
palettes we're gonna play with one of
their palettes today
well yeah color brain I feel like what's
the big brand that I discovered this
year gotta try some more Chris Anna and
cosmetics this year I love I really do
love the brow the brow product I think
that's my favorite thing that she does
is the brow at least that I've tried the
eye shadows are good they're good and
they're very affordable but I would say
the brow is what stands out to me as
being like the stellar product from that
brand Julian Winston when my birthday is
again June 8th is my birthday June 8th
1978 I have a funny story about my
birthday real quick that's completely
off topic so while I do I'm gonna set up
my base with the meet Matador palette
cuz I don't thing I've ever used this on
camera
we're news Matt Russo so when I was in I
was still living with my parents
and I was I think
19 or 20 I was waiting tables and I used
to go into this local bar and hang out
with my friends I didn't drink but I
wasn't supposed to be there like they
didn't serve me any alcohol again I
didn't even try because I always have
always had this like moral conscious
thing so I was playing keno with the
bartender the bartender was playing keno
and he said what should we what should
we play what's your birthday and I was
like June 8th 1978 and he looked at me
and he was like because I was only 19 I
said oh I mean 1976 and he was like
uh-huh he knew I was underage he knew I
wasn't supposed to be in there I was in
there all the time but because I wasn't
drinking I think he let me get away with
it because I was nice and he knew I
wasn't gonna do anything stupid
I can't let me get away with it but that
was like so embarrassing because I've
been going in there like six eight
months almost you know you know probably
three times a week with my friends from
the restaurant so it was just kind of
funny like whoops so anyway all right
let's go ahead and go back and to meet
my dad or we're gonna go in with Matt
Williams right here and kind of deepen
up the crease a little bit all right
what's your favorite YouTube memory of
2017 this one's it this one's an easy
one Oh Susan says my first job was at
Burger King for 285 an hour oh my gosh
really
Wow 285 I don't remember how much I made
with my first job well my very first job
was at Boston Market Boston Market where
like it's like rotisserie chicken I
don't know if you have a Boston Market
near you that was my very first job I
don't know how much I made I want to say
I was like SEP 625 an hour or something
like that it was whatever minimum wage
was at the time and that would have been
19
six 1996
something like that Kathy says her first
job was at Wendy's nice
but anyway favorite YouTube memory of
2017 was definitely my collaboration was
Stephanie Nicole ooh fallout hot oh
definitely my collaboration with
Stephanie Nicole was my top moment of
2017 that was incredible just getting to
meet her and hang out with her and my
friend Nicole from yay or nay Nicole
that was a wonderful experience and I
just a reminder I have four more
collaborations coming out this year
where I'm traveling and I cannot wait
cannot wait for those I'm just gonna use
this mirror but yeah so that was
definitely nope I need this mirror this
mirror so amazing it's like such a
game-changer but yeah that was
definitely my favorite also going the
generation Beauty events by Ipsy and
meeting people you know surely and and
who else did I mean I met a lot of
people that are like subscribers that I
recognize their comments you know
getting to see people again getting to
see my friends again you know that was
that's that's kind of my favorite thing
I love traveling for this job I love
traveling and talking to people and
meeting new people and having new
experiences and it just makes me happy
Nick I'm gonna call this here hi my
friend you haven't seen Nicole's channel
yay or nay Nicole you should go check it
out Stephanie Nicole is really nice she
says it was such a fun day it sure was
wasn't it all right I'm just gonna
deepen up the crease a little bit I am
actually doing techniques my friend
Sheila who has been a subscriber for
ever sent me a video by wint Whitney
Hendrik I believe and I had to kind of
suck up my pride a little bit and watch
her beauty makeup brushes 101 video like
I was like okay I guess I'm going back
to makeup 101 like feeling really bad
you know five years into my channel
watching a brushes 101 video but I
sucked it up and I watch it and I'm so
glad that I did because I'm you
the techniques that she recommends I'm
using them right now and my eyeshadow is
looking really pretty so Whitney
Hendrick is her name and it's her
eyeshadow brush 1-hour blending brush
101 video that she sent me and one good
thing about me improving my makeup
skills is that I can tell you what
worked for me you know not being a
makeup artist when I learn something new
I can share it with you oh yeah I'm just
doing what she said to do in that video
so I don't want to go over it here but
you can watch that video if you want and
see what she said and you can also see
kind of what I'm doing here but it's
starting to look really really good oh
my goodness nicole says it's actually on
before 7:00 a.m. California time because
she's over in San Francisco Wow
oh my goodness it is 26 minutes in and
I'm not even done with the first tag
okay so that was definitely awesome the
generation Beauty events were awesome I
hit 10 million video views which was
super awesome and then I had a hundred
thousand subscribers so those were huge
milestones for me my channel had a
fantastic year I almost doubled in
subscribers this year I started off with
I think sixty five thousand subscribers
and now I'm almost at 120,000 so this
was a huge year for my channel and it
was a wonderful year as far as like
channel growth but I don't see that as
something that I accomplished because I
didn't have any control over that all
I'll talk about that in a minute there's
something in the beauty community tag I
don't want to give up my hand all my
answers for that but I see like the the
travel as kind of like something that I
controlled and did and loved to do but
like as far as like the channel growth
and stuff I feel like that's you know
I'm being consistent I'm trying to
support that but I really don't have
control over whether people watch my
videos or whether they subscribe or not
but it was a really good year for the
channel so very excited about 2018
hoping that things continue to grow
nicely number eight is how many videos
did you publish in 2017 they take a
second and take a guess in your mind how
many videos you think I did in 2017 now
365 days in a year you know I do five
makeup minutes I do watts of makeup and
then I do
like two to three other videos a week
and I do live chat at least once a week
doo-doo-doo-doo I put up four hundred
and seventy four videos this year four
hundred seventy four videos yup that's a
lot a lot 474 what made you proud okay
it is in this tag what made you proud or
what you considered as a compliment as
an accomplishment I in my note I wrote I
tried some new things some were
successful than others I tried I tried
new stuff I jumped I did jump out of my
comfort zone like I did like the just
watches videos where it was like old
pallets that justice show swatches of
them we have four hundred six hundred
three hundred and twenty four hundred
seventy four damn you got it right on
the money yup four hundred seventy four
because there's a 30-second delay in
between when it goes to you and what I'm
actually saying it but anyway so just
watches was a total bomb it was just an
idea I was trying to get more content up
that was relatively easy to produce and
that was a total bomb what the Kay was
something that was out of my comfort
zone and I really loved it and I'm
thinking about bringing some of those
episodes back in 2018 I got a lot of
requests to bring back some those
episodes but I want it to be not just
random little piddly things like I want
it to be like things that are actually
super interesting so I do want to bring
some back what the K and then of course
the everyday people tutorials were
totally out of my comfort zone but I'd
like to do more of those too because I
think that it's good to do tutorials
just for people that are just learning
how to do makeup you know everyday kinds
of things not these big huge glam bold
look there's plenty of big huge glam
bold looks artsy looks that are out
there by these amazing artists you know
not everybody wants that there's there's
a market out there for people that just
want to do everyday people kinds of
things so Bobby says what the K yay
Jackie says love your channel oh thank
you so much okay so and also I feel like
a big thing that I did this year was I
improved my review format I feel like
I've tweaked it and tweaked it and
gotten a lot better at it
where I feel like in the beginning of
the year I was doing a lot more
ingredient analysis I was giving you way
too much information about the
ingredients so I've kind of scaled that
back and then now in 2018 I'm doing more
where tests which I think are super
helpful so you know tweaking that and
making that better I think has been a
big accomplishment for me so yeah
Queen Anna says maybe doing a poll on
what the K items will ensure you're
testing product people want to see I
mean in terms of increasing traffic on
those yeah I could definitely do that
like in my Facebook group and stuff I
don't think there's really a way to do
that on YouTube because YouTube with the
polls they only allow you five choices
and I don't know I think like Twitter or
even Twitter I don't think gives that
many choices I'm going into the coloured
raine Lovely's palette this is what it
looks like on the inside it's really
really pretty and I'm just gonna go into
this shimmery pink shade cuz I love
shimmer on my eyes even for like
everyday wear I love shimmer it makes me
so happy and I'm just gonna put that all
over the lid and leave it at that
that looks so pretty I love it Thank You
Whitney for the blending tips oh it's
really good
alright no put this on the other side I
just love their their shimmer foil dish
kind of formula it's really like a
foiled pink it's really pretty and if
you want to try coloured raine their
singles are really really good if you
don't want to invest in like a whole
palette get the singles they're amazing
all right and that's all I'm gonna do on
the I look I think I'm gonna be done
with it there I think I'm like maybe
I'll put a little bit on the lower
lashline let's do just for fun hmm
I want to do everyday wear so let's go
back into the meet Matador and then I'll
just do a little bit of this Matt
Williams on the lower lashline okay so
that is it for the YouTube rewind 2017
tag so now we're gonna go into Lisa
Stevens beauty community tag which
should be fun it's good questions and
hopefully you guys are finding this
interesting and fun Jean oh you know
what I forgot to grab was an eyeliner
just realize that totally forgot to grab
an eyeliner okay hold on a second let me
grab an eyeliner oh I didn't grab
mascara either Han everything is
escaping me at this point what the world
I hate when I can't find things I know I
have an eyeliner right here somewhere oh
I'm sorry oh there we go there's my neck
up again NYX epic ink and then I seem to
grab a mascara okay we'll just grab this
because I'm still testing this okay
sorry about that guys okay Aspen hey
Aspen says Jenny you getting the the
bomb matchmaker something like that
probably not I don't really see myself
getting that to be completely honest I
need to worry about the things that we
have I have like a Pat McGrath
mothership palette I've got the
chocolate bar gold chocolate bar palette
I've even got that Fanta Beauty glitter
thing that's like out now like I don't
think anybody's even they're even
selling that anymore so I've got to
worry about like the stuff that I have
so I don't think I'm gonna get anything
new for a little while I want until I'm
less overwhelmed with the things I
already have this is the NYX epic ink oh
my gosh it's amazing super super fab my
gosh I can't do this one-handed this is
terrible hold on and
going to the beauty community tagged by
Lisa Stevens have to straighten this up

eyeliner of the way that I do my
eyeliner in case you're interested in
that Holly says her epic ink liner

using it over a primer I don't know it's
so weird
Oh Julian wants to know which ASMR
youtubers I like oh my gosh I am in love

can't help but love his ASMR videos some
of them some of them are really weird
whispers red and I have so many Olivia
kiss / and who else do I love
so many do it that says nothing to the
beauty community tag but I love ASMR
ASMR is Auto I can't even say what it
stands for it's basically like really
weird it just goes click it's good go on
YouTube type in ASMR click on one of the
videos it'll bring you to a whole
another planet you'll either love it or
you'll hate it jelly bean greenie ass
jelly bean greenness subscribe to my
channel JB
yes I love her her role plays where
she's like extracting negativity she
goes does things like this and like
pulls the negativity out of your body
she's amazing she's absolutely amazing
totally addicted if you don't know ASMR
it people say it sounds kinky it's not
it's really not in any way it's not
kinky it's not it seems like it might be
but it's not just just do yourself a
favor and go and look on YouTube type in
ASMR and just click on a random video
and you'll feel like you're on a whole
another planet and again you're either
gonna love it or you'll hate it it's one
of the other auto sensory something yeah
exactly Jenny exactly alright let me go
back to beauty community watch nothing
to replay pal I am nuts I know okay I'm
all over the place I'm getting ready I
got questions I'm off topic
alright so reviews I love reviews what
are your what are your favorite videos
to film of course my review videos I
love my review videos and my truth
series I love filming for the truth
series they are so fun to get ready for
and gather information for and present
information to you because I think it's
just it kind of brings my teacher side
in a little bit and I love giving a
different perspective that people might
not have thought of
of course people might have thought of
it but I just like giving my perspective
on things so that yes I love making my
truth series that one's really fun
number three what are your least
favorite videos to watch
I don't watch hauls I don't watch them I
see a haul from my favorite subscriber
and I don't watch it I'm a subscriber
from my favorite video creators and I
don't watch all I don't like them I find
them to be boring it's like oh here's
something I got and here's something I
got and here's something that I got
and it's like okay fine it's a box of
thing and you know it's a thing and you
got it that's cool but that doesn't give
me a good information so I don't watch a
lot of holes very rarely will I watch a
PR haul really if I find the person to
be entertaining I'll watch a PR haul but
rarely will i watch one of those empties
videos for some reason I don't really
watch much
I know empties videos are really really
valuable but for whatever reason like I
don't know there's something about
empties videos that I don't enjoy maybe
it's because it's like somebody's trash
or something I don't know I don't know
Kelsey says this ASMR cause seizures I
would imagine not I wouldn't think so
I've never seen one with like blinking
lights or anything like that but yeah so
yeah I don't really like empties for
some reason I just never watched them
I don't watch vlogs I'm not I don't know
why I'm just not interested in vlogs
even people that I love and think
they're great I don't watch a lot of
Long's I know some people love vlogs I'm
just I don't watch reality TV though
either like desperate house was a
Desperate Housewives that what Scott I
don't even know because I've never
watched it like ever
I don't watch reality TV I don't watch
Big Brother I don't watch The Bachelor I
used to really watch The Bachelor a lot
back when I was single but as soon as I
met Jon I was like done with that show
but yeah I don't watch me on TV so I
guess that's why I don't like vlogs and
stuff watch that stuff I can see why
other people like it though Cheyenne
says empties videos never interested her
either there we go
Mary loves Audi's but she doesn't like
vlogs yeah oh hello in Belgium Judith
welcome welcome glad that you're here
all right oh I should probably keep
going I'm doing too many things next up
was what is your favorite part of the
beauty community oh my gosh so many cool
people so many cool people and I get to
talk to cool people and it's not just
creators its subscribers I mean like
okay for example Valerie okay let's just
talk about Valerie since Valerie is here
Valerie and I have this in common that
we love Valerie's a subscriber of mine
I've never met Valerie but we have this
love
for the show supernatural and we both
absolutely love the show she goes to
like the conventions and stuff
and I don't so I live vicariously
through her when she goes to these
conventions when I was in New York City
you might know the story you might not
know this story when I was in New York
City I was walking down the street I
flipped out on Twitter so walking down
the street and one of the stars Jared
Padalecki
of Supernatural walked past me I'm just
walking down a side road in New York
City on my way to a dinner that was
hosted by my friend Julius Salvio who
has a YouTube channel and her Instagram
blew up this year she's really good at
tutorials but I was walking to her party
from generation Beauty and here comes
Jared Padalecki walking down the street
right past me I was like oh oh my gosh
oh my god like freaking out in my head
you know that this guy from my favorite
show is walking past me right so what's
the first thing I do I go on Twitter and
I tweet Valerie like that was the first
thing I thought of was I've got to tell
Valerie and I've never met Valerie
before Valerie is the subscriber of mine
but I feel like we've got this
connection you know what I mean
so it's like valleys probably like
freaking out right now my pleasure like
stop talking about me but still I mean I
just feel like I have gotten connected
just so many people and it's just like
you know situations like that where I
didn't even think to talk to my husband
about it in the moment I thought to talk
to Valerie you know so Shauna says did
you see the new Supernatural
subscription box I have seen it it's a
bunch of junk I would never eat it's
honestly like I'm not a big like fandom
collector kind of thing it just ends up
junk everywhere and I probably would
never use that but but yeah I think it's
cool for some people but that's not
something I'll probably end up getting
but anyway so that was that was that's a
thing and then like going to generation
Beauty and you know hanging out with
people and it's just it's so cool it's
so cool meeting so many really
really interesting people we've got
IMATS coming up in New York in April and
I already know that I'm gonna meet a
couple of people that I've never met
before that I'm so excited to meet and
you know traveling and getting to meet
people going to get meet Stephanie
Nicole you know hanging out with yay or
nay Nicole like I got to stay at her
house and hang out with her and had her
dog and her dog ate my shoe and it was
it was fun it was really he didn't eat
my shoe
but chewed on my shoe for a little while
and it was just fun Oh Betty Ann bye
Betty Anne Lamott Betty Ann's leaving
bye Betty Ann Betty Ann's been
subscribing for subscribed forever
oh but anyway so so yeah it's just the
people the people are awesome and
anybody that tells you that the beauty
community has terrible people they're
not hanging out with the right people
because there are so many cool people so
many cool people but anyway so that that
was my long answer for favorite part of
the beauty community my least favorite
part of the beauty community is the
elitism there is serious hierarchy
elitism where people really and truly
believe that they are better than you if
they have more subscribers than you
there are people that truly believe that
not everybody of course but there are
people that genuinely believe that that
it's a numbers thing and if you are here
then everybody here is insignificant and
I can guarantee you there are people
that believe this and it's awful it's
absolutely awful the elitism I hate it
it drives me insane because I am one
that believes very very strongly that no
one is better than anyone I don't care
Beyonce who is amazing in so many ways
she does not have more value as a human
being than you do or I do or anybody
else just because she's talented and
famous and amazing she does not have
more value as a human being I picked her
specifically because she is so
incredibly respected by the way this is
Mikiko milano blush soft touch blush i
believe that every human being has an
equal level of value unless you are a
cruddy human being who has done cruddy
things to people to the point where you
know you belong in prison
because you have done horrible things
that have been proven to have been done
then you know that's a whole other story
but overall 99% of people I believe are
equal in their value on this earth and
that's just what I believe so the fact
that someone who makes Beauty videos on
YouTube thinks they're better than me
drives me insane because no one's better
than anybody that's something I hate the
whole numbers game I hate it
Oh Julie says that Wayne Goss was just
talking about that yeah it's stupid it's
so stupid I mean be proud of your
numbers be proud of your growth be proud
of the quality of your videos be proud
of all that but don't think you're
better than people you know what I mean
back oh yeah hate it I absolutely hate
it okay
lorac was kind enough to send this to me
this is their original contour palette
I'm so so excited to have this I've
always wanted this and I'm really
excited to have it they did send me the
original lorac pro powder I'm actually
doing a giveaway on Instagram right now
for it so if you want to answer that go
over to my Instagram it's John Lowe's
reviews you can enter over there I think
it ends on the 14th of January I believe
I didn't bring blush um highlighter
brush here we go this will work this is
the elf blush brush that will work for
contour oh wait you know what I need
that for highlight where's the contour
brush I brought over but it's the one I
brought the contour brush maybe not I
don't know I could just use this as fine
yeah the elitism drives me nuts because
they actually believe it and it's like
get over yourself there's nothing wrong
with being proud but there is something
wrong with thinking you're better like
actually better that someone does not
deserve to have a conversation with you
you know what I mean and I think
sometimes we contribute to that as
viewers like when people have people
cheering for like in a meet and greet
and people are like screaming and
cheering for that person I think
sometimes people take that way too
seriously
you know I mean I think that's super
cool
you know the people would cheer like as
fans of someone but I don't know I don't
know I just think that's a little much
no it always weirds me out I mean it I
get it but it weirds me out it's like
really I don't know there's the person
they're just the person
yeah beauty song says Jen I agree with
you completely doesn't help that bighead
youtubers when people put them on a
pedestal yeah I mean I think some people
can handle it some people are cool with
it this is makeup geeks highlighter in
lustre I think some people are good with
it some people can handle it without it
going too much to their head and some
people just really let it sink in it's
like dude bring it down man okay so next
up number five what is a where to the
part number six what motivated you to
start your channel I had a YouTube
channel back in 2006 2006 2009 called
Jenna love 37 j en el UV 37 and that was
my first dip into youtube it's still
there all of my content is still there
it's not monetized so that was from
before it could be monetized and there's
so much copyright music over there it's
kind of ridiculous and nobody really
watches it anyway but I had the actual
very first pregnancy vlog on all of
YouTube I remember back then I tried to
google and see if anybody else is doing
pregnancy pregnancy vlogs and no one was
and that was I had Lyla in April of 2008
so that I'm very very proud of that I
had the first pregnancy vlog on all of
YouTube and it was good I really thought
it came out very very good I had I had
like um maybe three thousand subscribers
at the time and I was getting like 10 to
15,000 views on those videos so I was
really really proud of that I thought
that was that was a big deal for me I
think one video has like 75,000 views
and that was huge for someone with you
know 3000 subscribers so I love that I
love being in front of the camera so
that was why I started doing that
channel and then I had my son I told the
story a bunch of times I have my son and
I stopped doing it for a while and then
eventually I was like I need an
I need something to do that's you know
not just random like my old channel I
need sunny Sh so I picked Beauty because
I do love makeup so I picked Beauty and
just kind of fell into it from there
I've just always loved being in front of
a camera I've loved being social I love
I love talking to people I love learning
from people so YouTube is just perfect
for me
amber says if people are praised for
whatever they do no matter what it is
what happens is their ego grows and they
forget what's socially acceptable
doesn't happen to everyone but it
happens a lot yeah it does happen to a
lot of people yeah definitely definitely
desert Lilly says the mug highlighter
was too shimmery for me it's very
shimmery it's very shimmery shimmery I
guess it's not really everyday makeup
look if I was gonna do like something
more wearable I would have picked my my
hourglass the ambient lighting powders
those are very nice but tack flower says
can you please do a video of how you set
it for filming I can I could probably do
something like that it's not really very
interesting you're gonna see the mass
all over my floor that you can't see
right now I could probably do something
like that yeah I'll put it on my list of
things to do in 2018 if I forget remind
me all right and then Jesus says I am a
ham - aww
Connie says your eyeshadow is so pretty
thank you I really like the the
techniques that I used from Whitney that
was cool that worked out really well
I've definitely got some seepage down of
something going on well I'm a little
smokier now oh okay so now we're gonna
do lips and I wasn't sure whether I
wanted to go cool lips or warmer lips
let's go a little warmer let's do the
solo look dapat and Depeche Girl liquid
lipstick this came with the Dirty
Dancing palette that was sent to me I
always like to say it was sent to me it
was sent to me but it's a really pretty
color and I really like the cryptic
cosmetics liquid lipsticks they're very
nice they're very comfortable compared
to a lot of dry down with the lipsticks
and I'm being a mess
and I know you're not technically
supposed to moist your lips together for
liquid lipsticks but I do what works for
me and it works for me house thing kind
of smooth it all together what it's such
a pretty shape I think it looks good
with this look too I love these colors
these colors are like my favorite colors
these like mauvey pinks are my favorites
Toby wants to know how do you order the
lucky bag or you talk about the beauty
lush lucky bag I don't know if that's
still available or not you can go to I
think it's beauty let me let me look it
up real quick for you Beauty lish calm
slash lucky bad maybe it says Paige
cannot be found I'm not sure lucky bag
2018 let's try that 2017 nope
yeah I don't know I don't know where the
link is for that I don't know if
somebody whoa oh my goodness yeah I'm a
lucky bag sold out desert Lily says I
haven't looked in a few days I know it
goes on sale on Christmas Eve though so
if it was still around I would be
surprised if it was still around I know
that tatcha one is Tosh is doing one
Jamie says why aren't you supposed to
moisture lips together for liquid
lipsticks it has something to do with
the way that it dries down that you're
supposed to get a more even application
if you just put it on rather then he put
it on precisely rather than washing your
lips together it's just supposed to be a
more even application from what I
understand but I like it
Oh Joanne says the $75 one is available
in light/medium Oh No yeah I will be
doing my unboxing of that whenever I get
it Oh Julie says it was on beauty list
yesterday Lynette says it sold out I
don't know so oh wait questions okay
let's finish this up okay so what
motivated me to start my channel I just
really like this whole format it's my
thing yeah there's a tachi lucky bag
yeah it was in the show today
shann check it out I don't know the link
should
where to my page on whatsapp I make up
calm and she says Jen why do you think
boxycharm is not giving any awesome
products lately what's going on there
this month seems there's no high-end
brand I think that every month is
different with every subscription box
you know every subscription box has its
own there's gonna be month store good a
month that aren't as good and I think
that just some month just aren't as good
and it really I think it depends on what
they can get from different sellers and
they try to balance the box out and give
you that over $100 value this is my
thoughts I haven't talked to anybody
ever there about this specifically but I
think they just try to make the best box
possible based on what vendors they have
and what products they have and maybe
there just isn't as much good available
and they just you know they still want
to give that value or maybe they're
saving things for another box something
like that but I think that you can't
really judge a box by one box I think
that you can judge it better by like
three boxes so I always recommend people
are looking to sign up for a
subscription box I always recommend they
look at three months worth to see
whether it's good or not just one box
and you have to understand that there
are gonna be products that you don't
like that you get and it is a gamble and
some people would rather spend their
money on a product that they know
they're gonna like rather than a
subscription box where it's kind of a
crapshoot if you know what I mean
alright but anyway back to this let's
see who inspires you most on YouTube
Stephanie Nicole is one of them I put a
list on in my description box of people
that have inspired some of my content on
my channel I don't think in my chat
videos but my other videos but I don't
want to tell you specifically who
inspires me because I'm asking them to
collaborate with me and they'll either
say yes or no but if I tell you who
these people are then you know then I'm
giving away my surprise so I can't do
that so pretty much everybody that
inspires me on asking and collaborate
with me and we'll see whether they can
do it or not but it's going to be a
surprise but Stephanie Nicole is one
that I can say so number uh number eight
is number one thing you would change
about the YouTube beauty community the
status system drives me absolutely
bonkers you know just that even people
with 50,000 subscribers thinking they're
better than people with 2,000 subscribe
drives me insane I remember being at you
know like 8,000 subscribers and trying
to talk to somebody with 75,000
subscribers and they wouldn't give me
the time of day like that drives me
insane it's not just the biggest
youtubers it's this that's the smaller
creators that think they're better than
the even smaller ones you know it's just
I can't stand it the whole hierarchy
thing I hate it
number nine number one advice for other
creators new people starting out a
channel the best advice I can give you
if you're starting out a YouTube channel
is don't take it too seriously as far as
taking either success or you know not
growing personally you just have to you
have to have fun with it and that has to
be the motivation isn't the enjoyment of
it there are so many people that see
people making money on YouTube and
making a lot of money on YouTube and
they want that it's it's a dream job it
really is and so many people want that
but they expect it to come easy and they
expect it to come quickly and that's
where a lot of people invest a lot of
money and cameras and lighting and all
that and then they expect in a year to
have you know five hundred thousand
subscribers and that rarely happens very
rarely it can't happen but it's very
very rare and it's usually with people
that are extremely unique people that
have something very unique to offer I've
noticed people that are very funny and
entertaining seem to grow the fastest
it's not really about the quality it's
about the entertainment value seem to be
the best but yeah so I feel like that's
kind of the biggest thing is to do it
because you enjoy it and because you
have fun with it and not because you
expect it to give you something not
because you expect to get PR not because
you expect to get money but just because
you have joy in making videos editing
videos meeting people talking to your
community things like that that would be
my biggest advice because I'm in like
the FCO s group which is like an Ipsy
Open Studios creator group on Facebook
and I see so many people getting so
frustrated because you know the
Instagram algorithm is crazy the YouTube
de monetization is crazy and people get
so
frustrated and upset because they're not
getting XY and z and it's like but if
you just love taking pictures then
you're on Instagram for the right reason
you know what I mean like you just love
taking pictures you love creating makeup
art you love all of that Instagram is
gonna be the best place but if you're
just you know making doing Instagram
because you want to be Instagram famous
chances are you're burning out is gonna
happen unless you for whatever reason
are one of that 1% that can grow really
quickly really easily but it's very very
rare Christina says I prefer Facebook
groups lately over YouTube honestly yeah
I've gone through phases where I really
like Facebook groups I have a Facebook
group it's called what's up and makeup
and it's pretty amazing if I must say so
myself
but yeah Andrea
Andre wants to know if I'm part of a
network no I have never done a network I
see them to be scams from what I've seen
that unless you were a huge creator
where they're basically paying you to be
a part of it there's there's no point in
joining a network from what I've seen if
you don't know what a network is it's a
network where they take a percentage of
what you make and they're supposed to be
helping you but it seems like for the
most part they don't help anybody at
least that's what I've seen Stacey says
I think beauty creator events and
channel would be interesting discuss
makeup and current events little beauty
with a little brain yeah there you go
absolutely but it has to be for like the
joy of it you know and it's fun it's
totally fun it's great I really love
being on YouTube I enjoy a lot last
question was what do you love about
YouTube as a whole and I just love
talking to people and I love learning
from people and I love talking about my
opinions I'm a very opinionated person
in case you haven't noticed that very
very opinionated and I just I like
people and this is a great way for me to
connect with people and I love making
videos and I love talking about things
that I love and it all goes together in
YouTube I mean YouTube is just
absolutely a dream job for me
and I love it it's fun
so alright I feel like I'm fading as far
as my energy my energy just kind of went
but I don't know where more coffee more
coffee
more coffee stat made it into my veins
alright
I should probably pop off here it is
1106 nice computer battery is starting
to die Theresa says my motto is you
learn something new every day no matter
if you're young or old absolutely you do
learn something new every day at least
says Jenner you was Slytherin no I'm not
a Slytherin if I could pick anywhere any
Harry Potter house and I think I would
be and I think I would be in Gryffindor
I'm very much a Gryffindor with a little
Hufflepuff thrown in I'm a ha i'm
Hufflepuff e Hufflepuff e and Gryffindor
e my daughter's definitely ravenclaw my
son's kind of a Slytherin
my husband's kind of a soul winner into
though my son's like a mix between like
a Slytherin a Gryffindor if that were
possible my daughter's like uh
a ravenclaw and a Gryffindor but anyway
that's totally off topic thank you guys
so much for being here
I appreciate you I'm sorry if my mood
just kind of went brutal I don't know
where I'm a human and you know live
chats are live oh one minute I wanted to
mention that I realized because of
laura-leigh I saw her she did a
livestream where she actually invited on
Instagram stories people from they were
watching code for quests to join her
livestream and then it was like a split
screen where you could like the person
was on the bottom and she was on the top
I want to try doing that so make sure
you're following me on Instagram I want
to try that hopefully sometime this week
I think that would be awesome to try
that but I think my husband and my son
just left for birthday party I didn't
get to say goodbye I'll see them in a
little while though
see him a couple couple hours so but
yeah make sure to follow me on instagram
at Jen Lowe's reviews so in case I do
that then hopefully you can be there and
then maybe I'll start scheduling them if
they're super fun brief say she's a
slender claw all right guys I'm popping
off here thanks so much for being here I
hope you found this fun I hope you like
my look I think it came out really good
and I'm gonna try to remember to put
some links in the video description for
pertinent things like Whitney's video
