topic here very important topic you know
there's serious topics all around the
world and this is just a serious if
we're talking about eyeliner and mascara
today cuz you know they're important
things in my life they are because
without eyeliner and mascara I feel like
I really can't finish from a look you
know what I mean like I shadows great
but like sometimes you really don't know
how it's gonna look so you put that
eyeliner on or that mascara on and it's
like yes okay now I've got this now I've
got this and it kind of brings it all
together so today we're going to talk
about the best and the works of
eyeliners and mascara so that you know
what you want to invest in and what you
can just be like now I'm not getting
that and the way we're gonna do that is
through the collective breaking of
makeup awesomeness because I'm only one
person I only have one set of eyes and
once that eyelashes but the collective
brain has hundreds of eyes so we're
going to consult them because maybe they
have different experiences than I do so

I'm gonna say to load you in just a
second if you're watching this on the
replay you're also part of the
collective brain but you're gonna

where it should pop up but it doesn't
just go to jed loves reviews on my
channel enough of that let's go ahead
and
say hello to the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness oh there we go I'd be
getting a lot of questions about how to
draw how do I join in on chat so that is

morning Jenna good morning Paul of the
morning Kenzie and Denise and jenni kind
of kicking myself that I step so late to
get the colour-pop it's still up yeah I
heard with the colour-pop kind of cop
had a twenty percent off sale supposedly
they were extending it because the
website had crashed for a period of time
so then they went into this crazy line
thing which i guess is better than the
website crashing where you had to wait
in line online uh it's kind of crazy I
have my browser open for three hours
while i edited last night and did make a
purchase lunch if i was going to but i
gave it to the hype so yeah I didn't
making some lip purchases at colour-pop
so they're adding they're extending it
for today good morning Theresa and Kathy
Murphy and the house Diana hello fizzy
pop hello all right I'm gonna go ahead
and i'm gonna scroll down if I did not
say hello to you know that you are
important to me I could probably say
hello to people all day long we got so
I'm possible
Ilana and some mascara yes Kelly said
she just placed her order and then
Christa says it was until noon PST now
it's 9pm PST thank you so much Christa
for that Chris that my monthly
obsessions calm thank you so much all
right I'm gonna go ahead and take a sip
of my Kofi all right let's go hang it
started so let's talk about eyeliners
now and it's ginormous thing of
eyeliners these aren't all eyeliners
there's one section this section over
here is lip liners but other than that
is all I liners now eyeliners come in a
bunch of different forms my preferred
kind of eyeliner that I personally like
the best is the pen liquid eyeliners
these like this Jesse's girl is my
absolute favorite if you've been around
my channel you know this and I apologize
if this is a repeat but Jesse's girl is
definitely my favorite one this one is
getting very old the tip is just a mess
at this point I need to throw it away
and get a new one it is probably a good
five months old and it needs to go like
at this point so I don't even want to
show you really the tip of it because
it's just not representative of what you
get when you first get it but these dude
I this cost seven dollars I get mine off
of either amazon or the jesse scroll
website they do sell them at some rite
aid's it is very black it is very easy
to apply the reason why I like pen
liners is because of the ease of
application for example would I are here
such as my favorite liquid eyeliner
which is the bombs Schwing eyeliner you
have to keep dipping into the product in
order to get the perfect amount with a
pen liner it's already locked and loaded
with your perfect amount of liquid
eyeliner you don't have to worry about
keeping dipping and redoing so that's
why I like depends the best that one is
very very good also the new rainforest
of the sea one from Tarte is very very
good that's also one of my favorites I
want to go ahead and ask the collective
brain some of your favorite pen
eyeliners pen forms there are some of
them that are very fine brushes and some
of them are actual marker kinds of tips
um the see Christmas says the new liquid
liner thin conversion from wet and wild
recently is absolutely amazing thank you
so much for that for that Chris the
snake Sonny says love the essence I love
punk eyeliner pen but they stopped
making it oh that's so sad good morning
Christine Lee 314 excellent youtube
channel good morning Terry lead nifty
and thrifty excellent youtube channel
kelly seymour loves jesse's rely liners
i found that the colored ones aren't
quite as good as the black one
especially the blue one died on me julie
says the Physicians Formula brush one
she really really likes let's see jenna
says i love stila and Maybelline Hannah
says I like the waterproof from ELF
Elise is here you made it yay Christine
says she loves she prefers the brush
tipped ones Kelly says are there
different Jessie scroll Islanders yes
there are they make a black one a brown
one a green one and a blue one I've
never tried the green month but the blue
one dried out on me the brown one was
pretty good but the black one is
definitely the best for me I'm steph
says she needs Kat Von D's trooper i
believe it's a brushed if I can't stand
illus felt-tip it keeps fraying I
personally really do like both the Stila
and the kat von d I had to choose I
would probably say you know I haven't
had this the fraying issue like you have
stuff but if that happens I'm picked a
Ponzi but those book those are very very
much how much for which one Maria I've
mentioned like nine different eyeliners
I don't know right room the two that I
don't know how much the here it's right
here one I don't know prices off the top
of my head I don't have them memorized
you just gonna have to look it up so
apologize this is the tart one I know
that it's i'm pretty sure it's over
twenty dollars for this one but it's
really baby baby baby nice it's really
fabulous I this one is one that I used
in my look for what's up and make up for
the show today this is the double ego
double-ended eyeliner by pure minerals
and this is in the shade Queensland it
has the marker tip on one side and the
pencil tip on the other I like the
pencil tip better because it stays in my
waterline the marker tip it goes on but
it's a little bit weak in pigmentation
and lasting power is not super fab it's
pretty good
um amalia says that Jesse's is just as
real 699 yeah seven bucks yeah I co is
also great christine lee says and i
totally agree I code does make a very
good liquid eyeliner the next ones are
pretty good but we open forum but I do
find that they tend to rub off very
easily and I've also had them flake
occasionally depending on the toughness
of my day I've had the knicks ones flake
on me elise says the new wet and well
out to pen is good for 2 or 3 bucks at
least second Krista's vote for the new
wet'n'wild folks at Penn now I need to
go get it steph says the ico skinny one
the fat one is you the fat one is really
difficult to use unless you specifically
like a really fat line Christine says I
like the physicians formula and the kat
von d best she hasn't tried to jesse's
girl yet sam says I like the tort one
it's pretty nice and Jenna says I love I
co but I'm kind of scared of it alright
so i am going to go ahead and move on to
liquid eyeliners now liquid eyeliners
like like I said before my the bones
Schwing liquid eyeliner is my favorite
liquid eyeliner and it's because of this
beautiful point it's kind of a hybrid
between a pen liner and a liquid liner
because the point is this is it a brush
tip or is it a marker tip it seems
almost like a marker tip but it's dipped
in liquid so it gives you a beautiful
line I have to show you this i have to
i'm going to swatch up my hand I wasn't
planning on it but it is so creamy and
black it is just beautiful it just gives
you the blackest line and it gives you a
little bit of shine in there really
really like a lot most liquid eyeliners
are similar to this one this is a really
old urban decay one that should be
thrown away where it gets this little
brush and the brush has to be tipped
dips back and forth and it's just
difficult most of the time to get the
right amount of product on the brush
this is one I particularly do not like
this is the liquid eyeliner by NYC this
one is a mess to work with it is really
really difficult to work with it is not
show you it looks very similar in
initial application but it flakes so bad
on me and it mushes when you first put
it on like if you put it on and then you
go like that accidentally you end up
with this crazy mushy mess on the side
of your face it's insane so it smears
and smudges through the day but an app
if you don't touch your eye you might be
okay with the NYC but unfortunately i'm
not that skilled i touch my eyes and so
Nadine says liquid liner revolution
revlon colorstay and wet and wild are
her favorites and snape sunny says i
love the illamasqua precision ink liner
it's a waterproof and had a felt tip but
it's a dip liquid liner pristinely says
when wild is great for liquid the
old-school bendy brushes are her
favorites list says I do not like the
NYC eyeliner and I'm pretty good at
island on Christy says she's not a big
fan of liquid eyeliner she lets the
cream type eyeliner tomorrow and we're
going to get to that in a minute Chrissy
says the cake liners are also offering
it so as far as liquid eyeliners I mean
I just what even is this brand would
even argue this is a lore'l lore'l
eyeliner intense I abandon this a long
time ago let's find out why oh because
dried up on me this is a brown one that
I wanted to try oh no it didn't dry up
looks pretty good actually I've been
neglecting this brown eyeliner and I
can't even review it because I don't
even remember because it's been so long
as I forgot that's terrible what makeup
junkie okay but anyway so really the
difference between the marker and the
and the liquid is that either you want
the liquid encased in like a pen that
comes out naturally out of the tip or
you want one that you can dip it's
pretty much what we got going on there
so Shan says the tart so fine liner has
been a godsend for her very cool um
let's see Christine says christine kinda
says liquid eyeliners end up all over my
lashes so messy they can be very very
messy um it's back from the dude you're
funny stuff okay Zeb's always making me
luck alright so moving on we're 15
minutes and already next one
as gel eyeliners number ones that are
typically a part this is my personal
favorite one this is the fixed-line
eyeliner gel by Oprah this was sent to
me for review a long time ago but I
never reviewed my big pack of over stuff
because a lot of it was kind of like
okay you know like it wasn't good it
wasn't bad it was just kind of like okay
so I didn't review a lot of it when I
come across one that I do think that's
worth talking about I do talk about it
individually so this is 1 this is a gel
liquid eyeliner it comes in a pot like
this you take a brush a small angled
brushes what i like to use you can also
use the very very fine pointed pencil
brushes and you dip it in the product i
also tend to wipe off any excess on the
side of the jar and then apply it very
close to the lash line these are really
really nice because you can control how
much product you have on your brush and
a lot of times these are really really
smooth Genesis Maybelline gel is great
fantastic and that Angie says how do you
find the liner's you like in Atonement
alosta ran half of it and then it moved
okay how do you find the liner's you
like in that ginormous collection you
have you've got a lot girl because I
keep them in a special pocket I have
mine this is my link this is my eyeliner
pocket of things that I'm supposed to be
paying attention to these are mostly
pencil eyeliners so I flip the caps over
so that I have like for example if i add
the sephora liquid liquid this is a
pencil liner by sephora which these are
fabrics are about these in a minute but
i put it to the color tip is facing up
so that helps a lot with that putting
the colors facing off put a lot of times
i just have to search like for example
this you a ones in the wrong places
issue a kit liner this is a really nice
one see what really like that one a lot
my name I back to the oprah let me go
ahead and scroll back down because I
don't want to miss things Oh deep was
leaving goodnight Deepa have of the
night she's going her to her dinner and
end yeah she's going she's going to
dinner by Deepa will miss you Emily says
bobbi brown gel liner eyeliner is an
oldie but a goodie and I realize when i
first started getting into higher end
makeup I got the bobbi brown gel
eyeliner from my husband as a gift
I found that it was wonderful for a
period of time and then it dried out on
me which made me really really really
sad so anyway this right here is really
nice it's a very whipped formula which
is why I really like it it's very soft
to put your brush in you don't have to
dig a lot of them like the Bobby Brown
you kind of have to dig your your your
brush in the in the pot to get it on
their steps talking about matt black
track that's a really famous one too um
so really the key of a gel eyeliner is
getting a nice brush like you need you
need a brush that works for you I
personally like the really flat we get
one mom ice ordered another one from
Ulta i did a little alta order so i
needed a new a new eyeliner a new
eyeliner brush because i feel like i
wanted one that's a little more fine
than this so I'm hoping that the one
that i got from Real Techniques um is a
good one but this right here would be
one I would use for eyeliner so forth
sasha says Sephora waterproof gel liner
pencil is so good this is actually a
brow it's a brow brush from beauty
junkies but I you don't use this for
brows that use this for eyeliner and
have I shasha must know if I've tried
inglot I have tried inglot and it was
just okay for me it just didn't have a
smooth application for me if I remember
correctly so that's one style of brush
you can use for the gel liners and this
is the other side other style this is
the Real Techniques fine liner brush but
this is too thick for me I like ones
that are thinner than this this is this
is too thick so i don't really like this
but you know um julia says who finally
made it i'm sorry i'm late lo everyone a
low jen hello Julia good to have you
here good morning to Amanda on Finn says
yeah my first time actually being in
chat angle at jet liner is amazing for a
cream nars larger than its going was
going to be continued uh yeah and I
wasn't the biggest fan of the england
won and I don't I don't I don't know
what it was about it and I wish I could
remember maybe I was just being blow
because i had i bought a bunch of
England I shadows and I wasn't impressed
so I might have been like inglot and
been biased or so
I don't know it happens every once mo Li
says gen love that shirt him originally
from Lancaster Pennsylvania went to her
she often i had my husband's from that
areas to go to hershey every summer mary
ann says the elf cream is also good with
a small angle angle brush yes the elf
little cream puffs the I show cream pops
whoo so fab so fan Cheyenne beer
goodness gracious girlfriend all right
anyway no judge no judgment no judgment
another one that I wanted to talk to you
about is the TARDIS the tart TARDIS clay
paint liner this is a really neat
product I brought bought this on an
impulse and I'm really glad i did it's
really fun it's got this flat piece here
and it's got this little bull so when
you squeeze out the products you brush
your brush on the edge of the bowl and
then you put on your eyeliner it also
comes with a really really really nice
eyeliner brush like a fabulous eyeliner
brush so really nice good job on tart
for for creating this product it's
really good very black very fun to use
it's it's nice it's definitely nice
jenna says the maybelline gel line comes
with a perfect brush fabulous megan says
now i want to go out and buy a gel
eyeliner but i'm i'm on an ebay know but
it must be strong be strong naked you
can do it you're gonna do it Megan
Megan's are our own reporter for the
show Thank You Megan for your hard work
um let's see Elise says I can't use gel
liner on my upper lip because it always
transfer my hooded eyes but gel liners
the only thing that stays in my
waterline excellent advice Elise I
appreciate that so much Edina said Gina
try the essence once said it with
eyeshadow as what Deena's suggestion is
Emily says can we talk about the benefit
they're real liner oh what a hot mess
that stuff is in my opinion I shouldn't
say that so fast I should not say that
so fast because some people may love it
but the benefit the they're real leitner
was probably one of the worst inventions
of all time at my opinion um Nicola
nicole says that she loves the tart one
but it'll fall over her face in a couple
of hours Oh Rhonda agrees with me about
the benefit they're real liner oh gosh
all right Sasha says I was on a no
and tartan colour-pop ruined it a nice
okay let me see the benefit okay so this
is what happened I wish I could insert a
picture for you so the benefit they're
real push-up liner you were supposed to
click the pen you took this little
orange stopper out and you click the pen
and then it was supposed to help you it
kind of pushed into the silicone pointy
tip and I was supposed to help you to
make like the perfect winged eyeliner
now when I first got it I loved it for
like the first week I really really
liked it then it started having two
issues the first issue is that oh that's
what you asked because it was really bad
gotcha so the first issue I had was that
the product inside started drying out so
what they really needed to say was to
keep the little orange stop or in so
that doesn't dry out so that was the
first issue I had with a started drying
out the second issue is the silicone
bendy tip started getting really floppy
so it wasn't um it wasn't functional
anymore it just didn't it didn't work
anymore because you couldn't get a
straight line with it anymore because
that thing every everyone in the chat is
lighting up with everybody saying how
much they hate that mascara daniel says
benefit needs to really stop focusing on
the cute package and actually really
test their products out especially that
one I think that was the worst the one
of the worst releases in all of makeup
since I've been doing this channel it
was it was bad it was really bad and it
was expensive and it was hyped up and
the problem was is they send and outs
people for review people used it a few
times raved about it and then everybody
went got it but the problem was but the
problem was um loss betrayed by what the
problem was is you really needed to use
it for a good week or two before you
started seeing the problems with it so
people were recommending it without
fully and totally trying it michelle
says Jen for those of you with
transferring issues on hooded eyes give
the elf line sealer a try it seals in
any shadow you want to use as a liner
and she loves it excellent advice
Michelle thank you so much for that chef
says for me the product was too thick I
miss what Julie said supposedly Julie
said something hysterical totally missed
it
alright I have to scroll up and find out
what Julie said because apparently it
was hilarious oh my god Julia says I
never could get it to work no lie I
brought it outside in the street and
stomped on it what else needs to be said
I mean that what else needs to be said i
think i think that the julia has has has
described exactly what we all felt about
that letter so let's go ahead and move
on from the gel pots and the liquidity
kinds of forms to the pencil forms oh
one more i wanted to mention is the marc
jacobs remarkable liner for those of you
that like high end makeup this is a
really really really really nice
eyeliner it's very fine very uh very
easy to go on very very black the only
problem I have with it is that it does
rub the wing does rub off and I can get
cheaper versions of something that does
just as good as this I can get cheaper
versions like the Jesse's growing even
the tart is a lot cheaper than this so I
don't think that it's worth the price
for the Marc Jacobs but it is a really
nice eyeliner alright moving on to this
is the brown Jessie scroll by the way it
looks the same as the black it's just
brown me swatch it for you see how it's
dying it's like it's not opaque anymore
it's like dying on me you have to use do
like a bunch of swipes and then
eventually it gets good yet we're moving
on to passes here so enhances what you
basically have two different kinds of
pencils you have the plastic pencils
that roll up and then you have the wood
pencils that you need to sharpen
personally i prefer the wood pencils
overall for the sharpen because i feel
like it's more sanitary but this is
things what pencils is sometimes the
wood over time will dry out the product
and the product will actually shrink
down inside the wood which is not good
not good living like Julie's Oh says
agreed on the Marc Jacobs fantastic i'm
sascha says in terms of pencil liner
make up forever aqua liners afford gel
liner pencils are great for me my eyes
water a ton from contacts nothing else
stays so far Julia says I got the
Jessie's Girl pen / gin suggestion and I
love it I'm laughing at you Daniel
I agree I agree um Finn says physicians
formula I booster two and one last
boosting liner an eye serum is low like
that one I need to try the black when
the brown one has been okay for me but I
need to try the black one sasha says in
terms of Nikki got her assessed as Nikki
got me hooked on the art and CN monster
that is a really good one sasha says
nothing else stays in her water line
except when I met in terms of pencil
line and make up already read that one
already read that one I missed it um kg
says I like to steal a waterproof pencil
and long combs kohl liner and little
hammer says the only mate stays in my
waterline is the lorry mercy laura
mercier caviar I sticks less all day
everything else disappears within a few
hours Denise says she likes the Milani
eye pencil and christine lee says pencil
ulta brand gel pencils really great
which shocks me that is really
interesting I'm very interested in that
Rhonda says the colour-pop pencils have
worked well for her and Kenzie says I
really like UD 24-7 pencils living like
Julie says the Milani liners are cheap
and cheerful ok cool Krista says the
wood pets was scare her mm-hmm but she
likes their minute gay one let me talk
to you about my opinion of these things
so all right I would have to agree that
the Sephora brands eyeliners are super
super fab back when my husband had his
beauty youtube channel it was like a
parody view youtube channel he bought
this aforesaid i told him sephora pencil
eyeliners were all something they had a
holiday set of all of these colors of
Sephora liner and I'm so thankful I made
him buy these because now he's not doing
that at all anymore but I get to keep
the liners and these things are so
stinking good they're very creamy they
are really really good they are the wood
pencils they are the ones that you
sharpen but these are these are a good
year old and they are not shrinking down
at all like they're really really good
they stay in my waterline they're easy
to apply their super super fab another
brand that I really like is the bombs 1
i've heard some people have trouble with
this in the water line that they do run
down for some people but the bombs mr.
right now eyeliner pencils have been
very good for me these are the ones that
roll up and down
so I do really like this formula a lot i
also really like the color pop ones oh
ha the 24 7 1 i have not had good luck
with the Urban Decay 24-7 one I feel
like they run the most on me where I
have to constantly keep an eye on my
eyes to make sure that it's not running
down Patricia says the Mallee starlight
or her favorite I've had hit in this
with those some of those work really
well for me and some of them I found run
then the lighter colors of the valley
seem to work better for me than the
darker colors I don't know why very
weird um another one that I really like
is the jcat Beauty liners are really
really nice too but these do shrink down
over time and then some of these the
tips will break these were set to me for
review a long time ago I always like to
mention that but if you can get the
actual product poking out there really
nice but unfortunately they have some
shrinking issues John you are in your
underwear sweetheart my son just walked
in this underwear you cannot come on
camera and your underwear honey bun do
you need something is it an emergency
sorry wait you can't come in here
because I have a camera on and you
enduring your underwear and I don't want
you in camera sorry guys hold on a
second brooke whip is it an emergency
can it wait 30 minutes all right timeout
i have to go take care of my son real
quick I apologize Superman underwear is
not acceptable on camera hold on just a
second half what do you want to tell me
if it's ever not working with the circle
button okay good okay alright alright so
somehow he had activated and he was very
confused and it was I kept asking him
questions if you can't read so he didn't
know what was happening cuz see Rica
talking to him and right typing up
questions and he had no idea what to do
all right so anyway I do like the color
pop liners they do tend to run on me
though in the water line I like a much
better before the upper lash line
the colour-pop liners with the bright
ones that's upper lash line and I'll
anchor it with a black liquid liner
you're funny tablet alright but anyways
I do like the color pop pencil liners
the gel liners I've found to be a little
bit difficult to work with but those are
also oh those are also pretty good I
don't I at the blue one color pump um
one that's my least favorite says vente
veneto lining stuff stays on forever
tight lining is when you take your ol of
your eyeliner for those of you that
aren't sure if you take your eyeliner
and you put it in your upper waterline
that's what tight lining is it's
supposed to make your eyes look bigger
flash game it together Julie says I'm
beginning to think my water line is it
meant to have liner on it oh and it's
funny because a lot of times I've heard
that the eye liners that are
specifically marketed for waterproof a
lot of times do not work in the water
line um best ones for the waterline I
really like where's the one brands one
minute it's called blue are and I know
new are means black but the brand is
actually called new are oh my god it at
brunch box and I really really really
like that one for the waterline but my
thing is I don't have especially watery
eyes so I'm not trying up it's freezing
one on a minute you check it out okay it
looks like it's good now sorry if it was
lagging a minute sometimes that happens
with the live feed okay let me repeat
myself just in case okay on I met
there's also like but it's better now
want to turn it okay so we're good now
okay cool alright keeps freezing
Marianne okay I just want to make sure
that everybody can hear what I'm trying
to say okay Holly says we used to heat
up those waters Maybelline pencils and
put those on the waterline there you go
there you go you do what you got to do
okay r
we're good now so sorry about that so
let me just tell you what I was going to
say the new war is the name of the brand
I know that Norman's black but this is
the actual pencil is called Noir and it
I got at the bar Spock shop I would say
that that one has been the best for me
for the waterline but I don't have an
especially watery water line so I can't
really speak to that so i would love to
consult the collective brain for the
waterline issue for people let's see a
lot of people are saying they can't find
one a lot of people are saying that I
look good and some people are saying you
can hear but the pictures frozen try
going out and come and come back I was
once desperate to get the eyeliner
working good so i heated up with a
lighter I'm scared to do that I'm
totally scared to do that it looks like
the feet is going good oh I hate when my
lip looks all beat up and chat but you
know what are you gonna do um lets a
caddie says in my opinion 22 eyeliners
for water line are marc jacobs marc
jacobs in blacker and our glass which i
haven't tried either one of those um i
saw a sephora rimmel and nude works um
Finn says I've tried so many drawing
pencils but seriously I will continue to
shop my money for NARS nice okay Chrissy
says OMG yes I heat up the Maybelline
pencil with a match when I was 12 no
more water for me ever again my goodness
yes that that's a thing as you take your
pencil like this take a match or a
lighter and you heat it like this that's
a thing children do not set your house
on fire adults do not have set your
house on fire be very careful don't burn
yourself I'm not going to be liable for
you burning yourself be very very
careful children should not be using
lighters ever ever okay anyway this one
that I happened to pick up is actually
really nice one too but it does run in
the water line this is as you a um one
it is nice but it runs alright so at
this point we need to take our leave of
eyeliner and we need to go to
no someone says Rimmel scandaleyes
waterproof my foot yeah I even had good
luck with the Rimmel um the cream cone
one isn't as bad as the darker ones
though um anyway we're gonna take our
leave of eyeliner 90s makeup tips I know
right okay we're in sugar I leave a
violator because it is 1034 and we're
going to go into the land of mascara so
I'm going to put my foot these assign
you buying pencils and pens and we're
going to go into mascara now this is my
current collection of mascara that I
have some of these are pretty dead
they've been around awhile so some of
them are not gonna go anymore but a lot
of them still are okay oh my Anasazi
brow Wiz that's where that went I'm fell
in my best garrard little thing okay so
some of the one thing I want to talk
about first I want to talk about mascara
primers hey mascara primers are a thing
so what you're supposed to do with
mascara primaries you're supposed to put
it on your lashes first and then put the
mascara over it okay so that thing
happens show you a couple of them I've
tried that in my reason number in three
of them the first one I don't have
anymore is the dealer one the doer one
was just okay for me added just a little
bit of length a little bit of volume
this one is money right here this is the
Lancome sills booster XO if you can get
your hands on this I definitely
definitely recommend this one this will
give you a ton of volume a ton of length
I every purchase this three times and I
don't repurchase stuff because this is
the thing I have a youtube channel where
I review things and once I've tried
something do i really need to try it
again no there's so many products out
there and try so many new things to try
when I repurchase something like that
Jessie's Girl liner and like this CIL's
booster XL lash primer you know it's
something that I'm really really loving
so this right here is super fat the only
problem with this is it does go on white
so you need to make sure that the maths
care you're using with it does have a
very black color to it that it can
handle going over to
the white my only other complaint is the
more you use it it does collect product
that gets crusty on the outside of the
tube so you have to kind of keep
cleaning it over and over to keep it
clean but other than that super super
fab highly recommend especially if you
can get a sample of this girlfriend you
are hooked up or boyfriend you are
hooked up super Fab Olivia says Lancome
is my favorite eyelash primer it
actually the one the only one I like um
Christine says love any Lancome mascara
Tamir is great a Latin we're going to
talk about Lancome Hypnose drama man
alright the other one that I tried which
is a newer one this is the benefit
tinted primer they're real this is
relatively new it's within the past few
months this came out and it's got the
spiky wand this is very nice for someone
who just wants a very very light very
very light application of mascara very
light um if you want some supernatural
this is great not supernatural
supernatural but super natural um the
product is quite wet so it doesn't
really hug on to the lashes it doesn't
get it gives you a very natural feeling
to your lashes I don't think this is
worth the price if this were a drugstore
product I would say yes but because it
is so expensive i'm going to say no it
doesn't work as good as the Dior I know
that sounds kind of crazy that I'm like
saying it doesn't work as good as the
Dior and yours a lot more expensive but
I don't think this is worth the price of
it as far as it being a lash primer um
Rhonda says I've used the benefit primer
over top of clumpy mascara to unclamp it
that's very interesting i have never
heard of that that is really interesting
how they said she likes clinique
mascaras mary ann says the benefit their
mass fair they're real mascara is the
shizz I can say she is I just can't say
anything else this is what I've heard
and what my opinion is of the benefit
they're real mascara since we talked
about the liner let's talk about the
mascara the mascara for me worked very
very well I really like the effect of it
here's my issues
Wanda super pokey it hurts it's painful
second thing it's hard to get off so
those are my two things if you can get
past that get it but if you can't get
past that don't get it that's my opinion
on that one and I did forget that i have
tried to blink lash primer it and i find
that one to be just okay too let's talk
about blink first seven let's talk about
two did not scare us now I need to try
I've gotten quite a few requests
including the second play less or
drugstore our previous structural
reporter weird active in the community I
think she's a moderator on here I'm not
sure she's here today but yesenia and a
few other people have asked me to do a
review of many different tubing mascaras
drugstore and high-end and that's
something I would really like to do in
the future this is why I love tubing
mascaras this is my thing um tubing
mascara when you put them on they do at
least the Blake one does a really nice
job at the big win on chewing mascaras
is when you want to take them off the
end of the day all you do is take hot
water and you put it on your face and
the little tubes a little bit flakes
right off just flakes right off so the
blank mascara I got the black one in my
box e-tron which is sent to me for
review I got the black one and I loved
it the more I use it the more I don't
like it it is not aging well it is
drying out quickly it does not work
nearly as well as it did when I first
got it I would say that this the
effectiveness of this lasted about three
weeks to a month before i started not
liking it anymore the blink which makes
me really really really sad christine
says the blank tubing was horrible she
was disappointed i see i loved it i
absolutely love the effect of it for the
first few weeks and then start drying
out on me but in those first few weeks
blink happened to be on home look I was
like yes I gotta get something so I did
and I got the brown one which I'm also
not happy with I like the black one
better than the brown one but yeah I
don't know I'm just not a fan anymore it
makes me sad because I was really love
and I think it made it into a favorites
video because it would see was I was
like two weeks in when my monthly
favorites came up so no no nestle
achieving mascara that I've tried
marek way to others actually no that's
not true supposedly the L'Oreal double
extend in the red tube is a tubing
mascara I got that a really long time
ago / they work what the suggestion of
emilynoel83 and I loved it I absolutely
loved it when I went to repurchase I
couldn't remember what color I had
gotten and I got the blue one the blue
ones not nearly as good as the red one
the red ones super fat happy one he runs
in a graveyard I keep mascara off for
the method for a mascara graveyard video
I have a drawer of dead mascaras so one
day I'm going to do a mask our graveyard
video that's kind of how I'm feeling
about two big mascaras now of course now
we have a ton of other ones okay Sheila
any thoughts on the it cosmetics
superhero I'll tell you what my thought
is my phone is I am so kicking myself
for not getting it on QVC when it was by
two for like 23 bucks I am seriously
kicking myself when I went to go to I
bet I met up with Kristen game if you're
not following Kristen game on youtube
its Kri STI n G ehm Kristen game we're
doing collaboration soon Kristen game
was wearing the superhero mascara I
looked at her enough to Kristen are you
wearing false lashes because your lashes
look amazing like they almost look fake
they're probably not fake it was like
that kind of thing she's like no it's
the it cosmetics superhero mascara and I
was like oh well I did not get it why
didn't I get it I it's your oh yeah
Cassie from thrift thick who is also a
good friend of mine did a first
impression on the superhero mascara and
I believe she really liked it a lot too
so that is on my list of things that I
would really really like um it's Kirsten
I am subscribed to but I don't know I
don't know what her opinion is of um of
the mascara i don't know i don't know
but i am subscribe to her channel I've
watched every one of her videos though
so I would imagine I don't know if she
were muted or not Olivia says i love the
superhero mega length and volume and she
had zero lashes that's awesome see how I
want alright so let's talk about some
good and some bad in mascara so
this is the Loreal double extend the
blue one this one's not as good this is
this has the primer on the one side and
the mascara on the other get the red one
don't get the blue one um Holly says
christine named as such beautiful makeup
sweet woman yes she is agreed agreed
agreed all right so good ones Maybelline
lash sensational I like the pink one
better than the black one but the black
ones really good too these are very good
the assets has Kara's the iheart extreme
and the lash princess both colors are
both good Gina says I love me some game
time I do too Megan says I'm doing my
makeup right now I just try the tarts
lights camera lashes that is a really
good one I wouldn't say it's up there in
my absolute favorites but it is good um
Roxanne says lower lashes needs a good
mascara oh no you frozen again on a
minute okay it looks like we're unfrozen
I don't know what I was saying to repeat
let's see frozen still frozen so weird
cuz I'm for me it's rolling Lancome
Hypnose drama we're gonna talk about
that right here that in this drama no
I'm grandiose Hypnose drama is good too
mascara that's not water proof for lower
lashes you know what Joan I don't really
use um I don't really put mascara on my
lower lash line because I think it looks
a little weird on me like I'm not ready
for it yet so I don't have a good um I
don't have a good one for you but we can
ask the collective brain um who is that
Leslie was saying that the essence
mascaras are fab they really are for
super cheap if you're looking we're
super cheap really good mascara essence
you can get these at Ulta or the
Georgiana best / extreme do I have one
goes right now or is it dead all right
here here we go Jordana best last
extreme this is my third one of these
that i bought these are super awesome
these are at walgreens I believe sells
jordana daniel says Jen isn't quite
right of that level of commitment agreed
read Lancome does make great mascara
agree ok so the Jordana Bassmaster
stream I actually found out about this
through my friend Victoria over at
Victoria notice she had sent this to me
and I'm so thankful and then the essence
ones or super fab um so these are really
good
let me talk for a second about the
Maybelline falsies push up drama this is
a really nice one except for that it
does clump because these bristles are so
stinkin short it closed just so you know
um living Cavalier says thank you lash
sensational got it because of you oh I'm
so glad you love it that's awesome Pam
says I saw essence mascaras at target I
may have to go back and get them now
essence really is a nice brand Rhonda
says I keep hearing great things about
essence mascaras they're very good they
really are Valerie says the new revlon
all in one mascara with the red lid is
awesome to just a different one nice and
Veronica says I like to layer different
mascaras and I typically don't player
different mascaras because i'm typically
trying one mascara so I try to just do
one or another Lana says um or Lena says
yes Jordana is spectacular for dollars i
know and you know it's funny as i was in
a store I was in a walgreens where I
used to live but I lived in not so nice
of a neighborhood and the woman behind
the counter was saying on man I wish I
you know I was telling her about the
Jordana bells last extreme and how
amazing it was I was buying a new one to
go it's so good she's like I've been
meaning to to get a new mascara like but
you know I can just like strapped for
cash right now and it's like do I really
need another mascara so i ended up I
went I'm going to I didn't tell anybody
this I don't tell my husband this I went
to the back over and I grabbed and I
bought her one because her four bucks
you know they're super cheap so I bought
her a mascara and I bought me one and I
was like I'll come back and tell me tell
me what you think of it and she's like
thank you so much was awesome so it was
like what I'm like one of those moments
when this pay it forward kind of moments
where it was like I'm gonna girl mascara
be apparent she works at walgreens she
said she doesn't have money to buy
mascara so what bought her one and I
never went back because we move right
afterward and I wish that I had gone
back to check with her to see how she
liked her mascara but this is a really
really good mascara especially for like
four bucks I mean totally worth it
totally worth it all right anyway um so
another one
you
okay so we should be back I don't know
what in the world happened I got like
this little sad face I saw in the
chatter music know what happened to Jenn
and I saw this little sad face little
i-car you know Google I'm frozen again
reals okay so I saw this little sad face
little icon and it was like you know an
air or something went wrong like no so
hopefully we're back let me go back to
the live chat one on a minute are we
back okay cool alright so I don't know
where was I because i was talking about
all this stuff and then I lost it ok
thank you I see without Machado would I
just get bogged Lebanon of Liberty
pretty blah I'm glad to get a check-up
rolling I was like talking about when it
died so i can pick up where I left off
good morning goddess 131 how are you I
was talking about um I pretty sure I was
talking about the better than sex
mascara by to face everybody's talking
about the super sizer how awesome it is
glitchy went back after the Jordana
story okay so all right so now let's
talk about this one ornament the seal a
huge mascara so the steel inbred ones
gremlins crawled in my computer Amalia
ok so the Stila Hugh mascara is similar
in brush wand to the better than sex
mascara by to face it's got that
hourglass shape the problem with this
type of worm is that it doesn't have the
clump the D clump of five brush um it
just doesn't have it it's it's very um
the the bristles are very close together
so it's hard to get the the mascara to
brush out to make your lashes separate
but i feel like if i had to choose
between the steel a huge mascara and the
benefit better than sex i would choose
the steel a huge because i feel like it
the formula is better and I feel like
that it doesn't clump quite as bad so I
really really liked that a lot um Joan
says we don't have the shops you guys
girls having and Denmark
Hannah I'm sorry Joan Kennedy says I
don't like the bedroom and sexin deluxe
sample interesting that you've seen a
difference there kg says Ida clump the
Stila with the they're real wand after
ooh that's interesting to stick that
wand and there tina lee says that better
than sex mascara flaked on you oh no um
you think that it's terrifying holy you
know what's terrifying as I have it
anymore is the UM the what is it the
smashbox one that the brush is I'm not
even kidding it's like this big it's
like bigger than my eyeball it's huge
Cheyenne says what about false lashes
anyone it that's good with them have any
tips we can talk about that how much
time we got nine minutes left so before
we go before i go into false lashes will
talk about that that's a great idea what
i want to show you the buxom because the
buxom is another really really really
good one um this one I think is
overpriced it has the bristles that will
separate and the formula is really
really good so this is another really
good option this is the full and
fabulous version this is this a luck
sample so yes I've been on a false last
kick to Elise I'm totally with you
someone's it didn't work for me the last
trifecta by Milani did not like that one
at all I've heard some really good
things about the Malley volumizing
mascara but it did not work for me it
was not impressive on my lashes and I
know a lot of people love that one but
it was not impressive on me hello lashes
by it cosmetics is a nice one but if you
don't get it in your eyes because if you
accidentally get it too far into your
waterline it burn the stick out of your
eyes and ruin your entire makeup look so
just be really careful not to get it too
far into your waterline because it hurts
Paula says the NARS juan pokes you in
the eye every time the NARS the new one
the audacious mascara is one of the
worst mascaras I've ever tried
personally I hated it I actually hated
it did absolutely nothing for me the
bristles were super far spaced apart and
did terrible did absolutely terrible
alright another one that I hated was the
covergirl clump of flying blast pro this
was the one with that cool looking red
one here this thing is huge too scary
huge this did nothing for me I bought it
because
the assistive careful watch was in de
leche we'll talk about that jewelry
alright this is a this is a terrible
best care I don't get that one this is
the lights camera lashes this is what's
really good and he julep length matters
if you already have a lot of lashes and
you just want length this is a really
good one specifically for length the
julep length matters never really good
one I don't skip it all over the place
is the Kardashian the quickie mascara
this one's actually really good I was
surprised how much I really like this
one it's like a Christmas tree shaped or
pine tree shaped if you don't celebrate
Christmas um it's it's very nice it's
got rubber bristles but they're not
pokey really really really nice the only
thing i don't like about this is look at
this that's what keeps happening to this
that keeps happening to this it keeps
the product keeps coming out onto the
outside of the packaging so really big
fail on that one that I didn't talk
about with the Lancome grandiose I
wanted this is a really nice mascara and
I do actually like this crazy betting
wand because it does make it really easy
to get here really easy to get here you
can flip it and get over on the sign
here so what I do is I do the inner
corner I do this way and then the outer
corner I do this way and I really like
it a lot an effective it is fantastic is
it better than my drugstore i'm not sure
but it's really really good the other
one the last will actually it is
tomorrow there's so many okay the
l'oreal voluminous sculpt butterfly
mascara this one's brand new this one's
really really nice but it does get
clumpy so be careful look how beautiful
that Rhonda's absolutely beautiful I
talked about it last week in the chat
Tara we got six minutes left girlfriend
or Tara we got six minutes left I'm tart
tardis lash paint mascara this was I the
first time I tried it I hated it i watch
this watch it oh yeah so the first time
I tried it I hated it the second and
third times I tried it I liked it better
and better the the it's got a little
Bowl here to keep product in which I
really really like I also really really
like the wand on it it's very very nice
Amalia says have you tried the pop
beauty peak performance no I've never
tried that one sorry Holly says I'm with
you Melissa the Kardashians are doing ok
without my club without my chump change
that's true
that's a good point very good point okay
so that's what we're going to talk about
for that now let's go ahead and get into
false lashes because I heard it wrong
about false lashes this is the thing if
you want to if you want to get advice on
makeup this is what you do no on me
what's up a makeup facebook page become
friends with people on facebook on our
what's what to make a facebook page its

women on the community so really and
truly there's some women and men on in
the community it's way more women than
men and there's only a couple of men
that participate but telling you amazing
amazing so let's talk about the lashes
okay one minute so wonderfully i'll talk
about lashes all right here we go so
well i'll make the lashes here nippy so
these are inky pinky lashes by by
Sabrina if you know is the brain of the
youtube where she's super fab and she
has a lash company clanking making
lashes ok these are lashes that I'd use
this is the I've used them three times
and these are in the kind i think
they're in these are white lie i believe
let me double check yeah wait what okay
this is quite of us we argue lash glue
which I'm really really been loving okay
Oh Michelle says jen and i are periscope
virgins someone please help don't go to
periscope download the app and then
follow search and follow Jen loves
reviews you'll find everybody else there
so once you come to one of the Jen loves
reviews chance that's how you'll be able
to find everybody else because you'll
just just flick around and start
following people and you'll find awesome
people to follow and say you know when
you come in say hey I want to start
periscoping and we'll all follow you so
it'll work out um Gina says they just
said that I love zabrina so this is what
I do so I have my ardell lash glue and I
stick it or in like this okay just on
the band okay Oh before that we have to
talk about cutting the lashes this is
something I learned from my friends so
this is what you do when you first get
your lashes they're probably going to be
too big for your eye they're made to be
for the biggest eyes so what you want to
do is you want to cut off the outer
corner of the last just a little bit the
outer corner because you want the
longest lashes to be on the outside and
the shortest lashes to be on the inside
do not cut the inner corner you cut the
inner corner you're going to throw your
lashes way because it's gonna look dumb
at least on me it looks thumb so you
want to cut off the outer corner um
somebody said I candy says can you feel
the lashes while they're on yes and then
Rhonda says I'm afraid of fall glut
false lashes do they damage your regular
lashes not if you do it right you don't
want to stick them on your actual lash
you want to stick them on your eyelid
not your lashes so do not stick them on
your actual lashes okay you put the glue
on first you trim them trim the outer
corner just a little bit measure it up
without any glue okay a lot of them will
come with a little bit of sticky on them
to some adhesive that sticks them to
whatever their packaging is so you can
use that sticky to kind of place them
and try and make sure that they feel
good after that with the cutting you
stick your glue on
just a little strip you count to 20 or
30 ish okay once you get to 20 or 30 you
place it on your lash right then you
adjust the way that I know where to go
is I can really feel right here on the
outer corner of my lash so I move it
around and kind of wiggle it around
until it feels like it's right on the
edge of my lash right on the outside and
then I slowly press the middle to the
inner corner now it's really really
really important to get the outer
quarter and the inner corner stuck
really well don't be afraid of taking it
off and doing it again it's not going to
hurt you to take it off and do it again
if you have to so don't worry about that
Elise says the lash thin lash bands are
much more comfortable and you really
shouldn't feel them as much if you get
them on right and I think it depends on
the length of the lashes too if you have
natural lashes like the ones that I wore
in what's up in makeup today are these r
del now these are the demi wispies I had
the 120s on the r del 120s on for what's
up and make up for today's show and I
can't feel those I can feel Sabrina's
because they are so long and big like
and they're heavier they're heavier
there's more there's more lash there to
be heavy so Cheryl says the best group
of people I've ever had the pleasure of
meeting the pair at lowes oh thank you
cheryl i love having you part of it too
so the other thing is cleaning them
because it's eleven o'clock last thing I
want to talk about is well taking them
off taking them off all you want to do
is you want to gently pull them off
don't don't do all kinds of craziness
trying to get them off I just take my
finger and I gel off it's like it's like
taking off a band-aid you should not
have them stuck to your actual lashes
they should be too stuck to your skin so
it should not be hurting your actual
last urge to just pull them gently away
from your from your lid the last thing
is cleaning them so in order to clean
them all I do is I just take my
fingernail and I just go around and I
pick the glue off just gently pick the
glue off the band and then what you can
do if you really want to be awesome is
you can spray them with a little bit of
alcohol to sanitize them and then you're
done that's it that's it so I have
really been loving this and
I've learned a lot I didn't learn all
this on my own I learned this from
people in the community have taught me
this and I've learned it I done a little
bit of research when i bought the Anki
making lashes she's got a really good
article where I learned a lot of things
about putting them on so definitely if
you are interested in trying them go get
some cheap er dells go get some like two
dollar three dollar ordell's and try it
out and I do enjoy the ardell lash glue
do not forget to buy the lash glue
because a lot of them do not come with
lash glue so either buy one with lash
glue or buy a separate lash glue so
that's it let me see I got some decent
lashes 80 pairs for fifteen dollars holy
moly I love my bioderma I have not used
bioderma to try to get the lash glue off
though I'm not try that I mostly use um
right now I'm using the bombs take not
take the day off what's it called the
bones eye makeup remover that's in the
tin I can't remember what it's called
but that's what i've been using it does
not take off the lash glue I just have
to pretty much just come and go like
this for a while a guy might even still
have lash glue on my eyes right now
totally possible it's ugly possible so
anyway I gotta go guys it's 1102 my son
is waiting for me downstairs i told my
play a game with him when I was done
with chat so I'm going to go ahead and
hop off of here but i want to thank you
guys so much for being here if you were
in the collective brain of makeup
awesome awesome just today in the chat
and you did not get your voice heard if
i didn't read your comment and you feel
like you dropped something amazing give
the video about 10 minutes after it goes
live and that gives you tube time to
render it and then that will draw and
then you can drop it down in the
comments below so we can benefit from
your awesomeness last week the first the
last 15 minutes of the chat rendered
before everything else so if that
happens again all that is is a YouTube
error they just haven't processed the
entire track yet so give it some time
eventually the chat should be rolling
all the way through I don't know what
happened last week but that was a
YouTube air as far as the last 15
minutes so um so if for some reason the
entire Chad isn't showing that's what's
happening just give it a couple of hours
and hopefully YouTube will fix it but
yeah if you are watching this on the
replay definitely drop your suggestions
in the comments below so we can all
