I can't see me so it looks like I'm not
streaming but you guys say it's working
then we're fine you know I can't see
that it's working I don't know let's
just keep going I already did the intro
because i thought i was talking to you
and then I realized I wasn't hello my
friends welcome to the what's up and
makeup chat it is so good to be here it
is so good to be here and actually have
this be working so let me tell you a
quick story about what happened this
morning it's laying in my bed peacefully
dreaming my husband taps me on like what
what do you want he says aren't you
supposed to being checked and i said
what time is it and i looked at my phone
and it said ten o'clock and i freaked
out and I ran downstairs and the tears
start streaming down my face and you
think I'm some are you should walk are
you up earlier like yeah you should have
but I still love you for waking me up
and its just oh my god i just i was so
upset so I got chat going i put the
notes and everything and now we're
finally here i was having issues we get
in the stream going it is now 10 39 40
minutes late and i swear this it's been
about three years since i slept in for
work and I sincerely apologize anybody
this is inconvenience I apologize and I
know people count on the starting at a
certain time but that means it's been
about 39 minutes long so
there you go we'll go from ten thirty
nine to eleven booty so six second clip
are you kidding me it's working for some
people nice six seconds are you serious
on a minute healer second only went on
for six seconds is it working what is
going on well I'm let me make sure some
people are saying they see me when
people are saying they don't if some
people are seeing in and that means this
is probably working but the thing is I
can't see me usually I see myself going
and I don't see myself right now so as
long as everything is going on well with
seven people I didn't mean to sleep in
no Jesse Jesse some everyone's work
sleep in it and I agree with you but not
when you're supposed to be at work
that's not a good thing it's not a good
thing is anyway let's get there's two of
me oh my gosh seriously oh yes this is
horrible you two really need to fix
their lives shipping it should not be
this difficult all right let's get into
the topic because it seems like it's
working for most people goodness
gracious it should not be this
complicated it's just so anyway um
so what I did was I went to my drawers
and I pulled all the way to the back and
I dug and I dug and I dug woody in the
back and I was like a lot of stuff here
there's a lot of your own got to tell
you because I said this before i can
send us this chat is inspired by i
believe its movement if i am wrong i'm
going to feel like an idiot but someone
gets deep in the community someone that
is a die-hard collective brain
amazingness person and I think it's lupe
is the one that asked me to do this chat
and if it wasn't lupe I'm going to fill
up idiot but I feel like it was hurt so
this is gonna be all that forgotten
products products that I you know as a
beauty youtuber I can't watch yourself i
buy a bunch of stuff and then ski jump
in the back of the drawer so I find
things and I'm like oh my gosh totally
forgot about that so
my drawers I have on the i wish i could
pull one out for you i have the ikea
ones the outdoors so they're probably
like this not super bad but like this
you know cover drew it was Miss Thank
You Terry I appreciate that because I'm
pretty sure it was it's like that's what
my memories telling me but he didn't
write it down like a should herro but
whenever something is moving so she
asked me thank you terry for validating
that I appreciate it here is another
diehard member of the collective brain
so secretary but this executive is so
funny violet since December says you
know what I didn't do too I am so
disheveled I did not say hello to people
that are Luke left a brave I'm just
gonna say looking busty right now
Kimberly and Terry and Pam and Erica and
kaylee and the violet December and
Maryland and Monica and Aaron and hen
Emory yes okay Sylvia and Briana and
Amanda Valerie Laura province's little
Lin hello my friends jumped all Lisa and
Julie thank you so much for being here
alright so let's go ahead and dig into
each product and thank you to loot bag
fitting for an inspiration so I what I
started with was a foundation well i
started primer here we go this is the
primer that I found in the back of my
drawer this is the cover FX illuminating
base illuminating primer and then sesame
punta cana FX is a really um hit and
miss grand for me this is one that I
really really really really liked a lot
it's to like here I can see where the
product is I've use a lot of it and they
really like this a lot it got buried in
my drawer it's got a little bit of
luminescence to it but not so much that
you look like a disco ball I'll kind of
put it on my hand hopefully you can see
that it gives a little bit of a shine of
course it's wet right now so you're
gonna see some shine I'll let it dry and
then I'll bring it back up so you can
see the luminescence if you put a matte
foundation of our target economy
disappears but if you put on a duty
foundation or if you put a like a satin
finish foundation it leaves in my school
in essence just don't kill it with a
super back you know I mean so hopefully
you guys can see the difference so you
can see the difference between
hands but it's pretty dry at this point
all right so I sniffling now this is not
good all right Lawrence feeling a lot of
love for her channel in here feeling a
lot of love for the missus hole in
Laurel at bar and I have the way back to
the beginnings of our channels when we
were just maybe youtubers together all
right so anyway next one that I lost oh
wait let me ask you guys make sure
you're putting up in the in the
collective brain mixture putting up if
there's any of this kind of thing that
you have rediscovered recently that you
think is great yeah it's got a little
tiny bit of luminosity just a little boy
Mellie's has got in my Sephora play as
well haven't tried it yet it is very
nice she never says I gotta cover FX
contour brush at beautycon box and
beautiful box and she likes it very nice
and Catherine says jen thanks for
reviewing the kbd palette I bought it
and can't wait to get Oh Catherine down
let's check out Catherine Downing's
youtube channel as well okay so this is
the foundation that I just rediscovered
and I was obsessed with this foundation
for about six months and I think he
forgot about it I forget about it I knew
it was there but I just keep not using
it because i'm using other things this
is enabling fitne matte and poreless
this is the normal to oily I've talked
about it a million times in the channel
by talk about it recently is it that
pushed to the back of the drawer and I
know that a lot of people really love
this foundation and some people really
hate this foundation and the people that
seem to really hate this foundation are
the people with dry skin pseudo really
really really like this um laura says we
go way back love you forever such hours
of use Thank You Laura uh so yes I
really really like this i think laura
likes this one too if i remember right
the finish on this is really really nice
the coverage is really really nice I
remember when I got this I was like oh
my gosh if you told me this was a
high-end foundation I'm totally believe
you just the way the finish is it's
really nice it's got a great lasting
power and I really enjoyed this and that
movie well kind of cool see I say things
sometimes I'm like wait well no woman
completely free about I knew it was
there it's just I it just keeps getting
passed by and I need to use more is what
it comes down to it that's what I'm side
Sabrina says it's a nice fun day soon
Sabrina the makeup mom also has a
YouTube channel check her out um he says
yeah I don't like it at all but my skin
is so dry see there you go there you go
Michelle one of our moderators and
what's up makeup reporters says I can
not use the matte and poreless anymore
but I'm loving the dewy and smooth I've
heard great things about the dewy and
smooth as well frog for dry skin oh my
goodness all right what color is it
let's sit this color megan is 120
classic ivory and this matches my skin
tone perfectly absolutely perfectly um
swarupa I hope I said that right swarupa
who has a Washington Redskins little
ipod thing she says I wish it came with
a pump my family are diehard Redskins
fans I personally don't care of my
family or leg they would love you for
that I love you but they would love you
specifically for that and Cheyenne says
she likes the one for dry skin
Jacqueline says oh I love to fit me
foundation I have normal to dry skin
really Jacqueline interesting ok great I
mean everything skin is so different and
I think that's what makes review in
foundation so hard um Gina says love do
we in smooth but I am a cracked pot Gina
don't say that about yourself Gina ma
all right Jenny says would use a cover
effects under the fit me or to Matt you
could try it it's probably going to
cancel it out quite a bit because I feel
like this is pretty that I mean you can
do is I'm going to hurt anything it's
just some foundation is going to show
through more than putters roses having
issues she says dear into baggage yeah
you too you know I love YouTube we
definitely have our differences equation
I love you too like this morning we had
a little a little spat a smoothie
meaning that i had trouble getting a
chat not actually youtube all right now
I've got people talking about football
cat is like go Broncos all right anyway
concealers concealers today so I've got
two of them this one if you've been
around my channel for a while you know
that I use this
to death there is like this much product
left in there because it's deluxe
emphasizing a need to reapply that's
going is and why so happy because I
really can't use this anymore it's
pretty much gone this is the bare
minerals summer this concealer I got
this if you subscribe to bare minerals
emails they have these really amazing
like like deals though the mystery bags
if they give out it took a couple times
a year I lat 30 bucks and you get this
an entire bag full of full-size products
and what it is is I think they're trying
to get rid of stop so then just throw a
bunch of full-size stuff in a bag some
of the stuff is discontinued except
they're not going to sell anymore when
it's not like it's bad it's just they're
not going to sell anymore they still
have a little bit soft left they're
trying to get rid of it so give it away
in these 30 our bags and it is the best
deal but you gotta send up for all
actually you'll even necessarily need to
sign up for emails because I sent up for
emails and we'll let you know in the
show what I get the email but that's
where I got this um this is a power
found a powder concealer and Nan is a
sub amazing I think I might have a
little tiny bit left in here I do have a
little bit left in their stuffs time old
though but it's a powder so it should
last pinned up let me show you he's done
putting on my timed hand here I was so
so surprised at the coverage automatic
at this and that crazy he wants to not
have any favorite mineral foundations as
far as powder foundations uh no none
that actually cover anything but I use
them for so that's kind of the coverage
Omega meetings as a doctor fast yes I do
as far as coverage let me see I'll go
look we'll go up topic for a quick
second for the mineral foundation for a
second melissa says you shouldn't try
jane iredale you would love I should but
the coverage on that concealer is really
really nice and don't have really deep
set dark circles with a really really
deep dark circles where they cover my
life mild the arc suppose that's talking
about to give you much lucky bag yes
stuff yes yes yes yes yes more you
should try and should definitely try to
think you would really like it it's
different you know so it'll be something
different for you to get into I'm hope
look I locked my powder foundation drive
use powder little on this combination
more one-on-one ebony here we go that
one this is the only one I have is the
only one I have and I actually really
like it i got this years ago do you look
way back in my channel there was a very
lovely woman that sent me a bunch of
mary kay stuff and this is something
that she had sent me she no longer sells
mary kay also would like her down below
mary kay this is their mineral powder
foundation in ivory too and i really
like this i use this a lot this another
forgotten product see there you go it's
a really really nice product coverage is
very light so I'm use it over i love the
BB cream things like that so yeah erica
wants know when the lucky bag is
available for purchase formulations
usually around the new year i believe
pregnant my Longstaff ratings to the
reader Nora says do you think it settles
into fine lines because although my case
is from i'm experiencing fine lines
suddenly it doesn't settle into my fine
lines laura at all and and the thing is
is I don't I make sure that I put it
over like that I never put it over a
thick foundation if you put over a thick
foundation it can you take but if you do
do the concealer let over like a beauty
cream or something later it doesn't
crease but don't put it over like a mac
foundation or anything like that because
then it can crease so just be careful of
that Dina says hi Jen finally on the
live chat so glad to be here I'm so glad
that you're here as well Cheyenne wants
to know what the lucky bag is a lucky
bag is on beautylish it's a mystery bag
how much is it staff like 70 bucks
something like that it's kind of pricey
it's like $75 or something like that and
you get a bunch of stuff from beautylish
full-size products it's always over a
hundred dollars worth of stuff but it's
a mystery bag something that a really
good stuff like full-size busy our
talents and like full bag of stuff I get
it every year if you look on my oh here
we go 26 or 27 through December Emily
says which sounds perfectly right so uh
so yeah so logging on to their sign up
for their emails if you go search for
beautylish lucky bag you can sign up for
their emails and they'll notify you when
it's coming $80 thank you maybe yeah
like seventy-five eighty dollars I
forget um jenna and tracy and navy and
then kimberly you're kind of going back
and forth whether it's 75 or 80 but it's
somewhere in that price range um but
yeah definitely a great deal if you have
that money to blow but it really is a
gamble but you can get stuff that you
won't even use like you get stuff that
just it's it's totally it's gambling
it's straight up dammit so you just have
to be prepared to lose your money on
stuff that you would never use but I've
always really enjoyed it so you know all
right let's move once I got lots up on
this table the next one concealer that i
forgot about which i'm going to have to
throw away because it's shuo this is the
pearl duel salmon concealer really
really nice concealer here and it's very
old it needs to go away it's got two
tones and the lighter tone is supposed
to be for for brightening and this one's
supposed to match your skin tone I did
get match for this with imax like two
years ago that's why this leads are
going to trash but i really love this
concealer it cancels out dark circles
very well because thought that Sam and
tone you really like it a lot but this
is gonna have to go in the trash because
it's super old all right let's move on
to more rounds the products that I have
loved it in the past but I'm awesome I'm
awesome Brianna wants to know did I ever
use the Becca a shadow palette I'm yup I
gave it away that I shall palette was
given away because I did not like it at
all it might eat on my eyes too bad that
was one of the things I got my lucky
guide last year and I do have those
videos there they're ones that I do like
on the fly up I did him on a fly in my
kitchen like they're like my hair is not
done and they're unedited it's the only
one that I do that for brow products
that i forgot about first one is the
brow pal by the balm this one's a
fantastic brow powder and totally lost
it it's wonderful no complaints about
this it's amazing and then also the
honest hacia brow powder had this
forever totally lost it it's amazing
it's
very very good all right let's go into
hmm let's do that's when I shot up with
eyeshadows I have a bunch of
eyeshadow palettes for you and this is
sad that i have one two three four five
six eyeshadow palettes in my hand that i
haven't touched in a year guarantee you
haven't talked to me how sad is that but
it's one of those things where it's
great to have as a reviewer it's great
to have some of these pallets around for
comparison purposes to see if there's
dupes that are coming out from certain
brands things like that so it is good as
we're if you were to have these pallets
in rum but it I mean I know that some
people be like well it's such a waste
and it is it is but it's it's just one
of those things where as a reviewer it's
very helpful to have things like this
and I do share when there's things that
I know that I won't use and I did not I
didn't purposely not use them I just
they got push the back of the door start
with a high-end ones first so we've got
this one this was one of my favorite
palettes when I first started this is
the kat von d is even eyeliner ladybird
college i love this palette before all
the worms went hot this year they had
the ladybird cowan and this is an all
matte palette by Kat Von D you can see
it's got the old packaging and oh my
goodness I love it I love it I love it
it is so pigmented so easy to use it is
that Kat Von D formula that people love
I love it it's amazing it's so so fun um
and now we got buried I got married
another one that got there it is a cielo
in the garden palette and I bought this
on sale at look when these were going
out and I never use it if you say maybe
two times this one I will probably pass
on Laura says old moon i love that pal
it's great the hell it isn't it um this
one I never used it and I think I need
to pass it on to somebody because I
don't think I'm ever going to use it
it's just looking at this I I don't see
a complete look in my head I don't see
complete look I don't see a transition
color I
don't see anything to deepen my outer
corner except for moles I just don't see
a complete palam in this and I'm just
not going to use it so this will
probably get past to somebody because
things to go I really need to do more
decluttering I'm decoder it needs to
happen that's gonna be like winter
cleaning of everything so we'll do some
more decluttering all right we cap on
the interstellar cow another fantastic
product this one I will use I think I
use this quite a few times before it got
shoved to the back of the drawer but
again I feel like you know you can only
get so many looks out of this thing you
know um more such as fast on the scale
of pallet to yeah I mean it's gorgeous
but you're mean you're definitely going
to get a specific look with this and
there's definitely something different
thing you can do like you can stick to
this end you can stick to this end but
it's only got so much range because it
is that perfect anything but it is a
very nice color it's very very high
quality it's wonderful and one thing if
you didn't watch my most recent kat von
d video that just went like this past
week the kat von d metal matte palette
definitely recommend you check it out I
mean I feel like Kat Von D is one of
those brands I don't get how she does
what she does she makes this amazing
product and she keeps it so cheap for
what it is I mean a dollar eighty
program is so incredibly inexpensive and
it's so high quality and it just I don't
know how she does it and I think that
brand need to watch out for her because
she is gonna take it she didn't take the
crown is what's gonna happen so just
amazing amazing amazing alright else
need a new going into drugstore another
one I am not showing enough love to
recently when I first thought this I was
using all that time I really love this
palette if you do not own the elfin unit
unit in your drugstore you love that
drugstore eyeshadow but you can't get it
to work for you this is a great one I
got off the elf website I don't know if
you can get it in stores I've heard some
people say they can get in its doors but
I can't get it in stores around me just
the quality this I am going to swatch
this one for you because you just have
to see this to believe it I have a whole
review of this from like a year ago
where this I mean it it has been
consistently a favorite palette for a
very long time and it just that pushed
the back of course these are finger
swatches you're not going to be the same
as well swatches but really really L are
you kidding me like usually when you
swatch an alcoholic they all look like
this one they're all super powdery but I
mean and they go on super well on the I
the lasting power is really good like I
don't know how we did this I don't know
how they did this it's so stinkin good
especially the shimmers and shimmers are
really good this is matt just needs a
little bit of building but it works out
and it's got everything you needed that
goes from deeps all the way to mid mid
tones to like they did a fantastic job
with this really fantastic job um step I
didn't see you I see you sir alright
next one these are all neutral palette
so just really I just really realized Oh
realized um because I show me neutral
palette is easy to stop using some of
them um alright the original reveal
palette by coaster sets is another
fantastic palette fantastic and you
should watch communities for you the
other ones are just kind of okay the
shimmer shades do kick up some powder
but look at this this is on sting
unbelievable oh wow that didn't swatch
well at all move but you can see the
shimmer ones they kick up a lot of power
but they work really well what happened
there with that one getting old on me
here here we go no no just watch the
same one twice and 10 do like um radice
uh what does the beauty by Brody says
when you when you are makeup junkie it's
hard to wear everything own and I
totally agree I totally agree but the
this one's really really good it has a
lot of the same shades the original
Naked palette and we make it to have in
them it's not a dupe but you have a lot
of the same shade so if you are looking
for those and you want something that's
similar I would definitely recommend
checking us out the quality is not as
good I'll tell you that right now if not
it's good but it's close enough where
you're gonna be able to get some of the
same flux and it's relatively
inexpensive from Coastal Scents I don't
think this was sick
sensitive for a review I always like to
tell you if something to said to me I
think this might have been sent to me
for review but I do have all their other
ones and I'll tell you that the three I
was not a fan of duty I was not a fan of
the smoky was really good smokey I liked
even better than this one and have I
used that one recently no that's another
to talk about the one to another one
that's really really good that I haven't
used in a long time as the next to go
palette look how indispensable this one
is in wanderlust it's really good oh my
gosh it's so good this one is very a
very bright blush so just be careful
with that but this one feels like high
in quality and I love the shade range at
two so if I can find some space here
those are the fingers watches for it
just oh I wish L saw the secret video so
you weren't supposed to see it till chat
was over but uh but yeah secret video is
up in live it was up at eleven don't
leave yet though don't leave yet chattel
be over in 40 minutes and then you can
leave him to watch it but yeah so this
one here was if i can remember right
this one was the number what I did oh
this is the neat at noon and then this
was revealed to a reveal the original
revealed and then this one is the nips
palette all great be careful with nicks
I shadows would be some of them are
really really bad um definitely you have
to go with the bigger pallets I thought
the smaller pellets a lot of times a
junk that's just my personal opinion if
you love them I'm so happy for you I
don't want them I love I like they're
bigger palette I don't know why they do
that I don't know why they they have two
different foremost I really feel like
the next has two distinct formulas crap
and good so I don't know maybe because
it's called as it is it probe now I
thought it said pro but it doesn't it's
really really good okay we have so much
left to do yeah you so much love so much
left um let's see Catherine says new
pumpkin spice video on my channel okay
good to know Thank You Catherine alright
so now let's go to single eyeshadows
that i forgot about i'm going to show
you this one oh i'm going to show you
this my first
check this out those of you that are FC
subscribers you guys remember this one
this is two cosmetics t wo cosmetics
have enough their brand anymore but when
I got this I was obsessed with this I
loved this product it's just 228 odd
shadows one of them is a shimmer and one
of them is a matte and I love this thing
I loved it put in a row by my thumb I
was obsessed with this totally got
pushed to the back till I got pushed to
the back yes yes I don't know why I
never had a pink eyeshadow I need to
pull for this and need to pull for it
all right let's go into other ones okay
these are makeup geek eyeshadows these
are the duo Chrome's I don't reach for
these and I'll tell you big reason why
don't reach these and it's because of
the packaging and isn't that sad because
they're gorgeous when my packaging is
breaking I have one that's in a
different container already this one's
about to die against hell um it's
cracking but the shades are stinking
amazing if I could just look if I could
get past the packaging this is the old
packaging on pretty sure she's redone
all the packaging but look at that are
you kidding me Marlena are you kidding
me amazing I just the packaging is all
cracking on me I don't know if you can
see that and it's cracking all around
the top and there's a big crack down
here it's very messy and the packaging
is is not is just not good but I'm
pretty sure she changed the packaging
the the what it is is this lid is too
tight for this container and it squashes
it and I can't even get it on own way
it's just I don't know how she got these
things out like this I mean the lid is
beautiful but it doesn't go on all the
way and then so you can see this one's
cracking here let me tell you that shade
is called hologram and this one is
called mood ring will swatch this one
for you oh my gosh it's so stinkin
pretty and I never reach for them and
it's because we packaging hello in
Mexico martika how are you my friends

to have you and Susan says hello from
Puerto Rico Oh Thank You Susan I'm glad

kimberly says I don't really care to get
the peach eyeshadow palette but I want
the other stuff yeah and I actually
still use my future palette I do like it
on occasion when I'm going for that look
it's easy to just grab for that all
right other ones asleep I shadows are
just want to mention very quickly are
the glamour doll eyes are shadows I used
to have a subscription that they used to
send me they do have a very exclusive
subscription program over at glamour
doll eyes it's an indie company man are
there are shadows amazing they're just
really creative and that's like I look
at makeup at glamour doll Isaac how is
glamour doll eyes do this to create
these amazingly unique shadows and then
you've got brands that just come up with
boring after boring after boring
too boring and then it's like glam doll
eyes hi this one is called a reckless
devotion I don't know if they keep any
of their I shows in stock for a long
period of time but this is my perfect
duochrome pink it is so so pretty it's
that purple onion purple it's got pink
with yellow shift in it it kind of
reminds me of the makeup people and then
it just showed you but it's a little
more yellow eight oh my gosh it's so
amazing so amazing just beautiful and
why aren't the big brands doing things
like this why happy and it's a same
thing with indie nail polish brand they
come out with these beautiful oil than
duochrome shades and then then the big
companies don't do that why is it that
hard this one is called under the moon
back these are all by the way these are
all power our shadows they're all
minimal gorgeous and their one more but
they're all gorgeous I mean I've never
gotten a glamour doll eyes eyeshadow
that I didn't like so if you're looking
for to support an indie brands
definitely recommend checking out
glamour doll eyes this one is called
facetious remember first time I heard
that I was like fascias patients what
spacious facetious with that purple are
you kidding me okay that's seriously and
it comes off on the I like that too and
we never use these because they get
shoved in my singles for and never use
them I never think to use them they're
amazing totally recommend totally all
right let's move on from my shadow I
could sit in the eye shadow all day long
good I could sit here all day long um
Merrill you know I I go I don't forget
my brushes there are no brushes that i
love but i will forget about they stay
in constant rotation there are
definitely brushes I don't like better
forgotten but I'll leave those muscley
because from another the button canadian
girl says knicks lingerie are nice to
dry down otay matte liquid lipsticks
we're gonna get there we're going to get
there I did not pull out any mascaras
because any any forgotten mascaras are
in the trash but I do want to tell you
that I was at when I was generation
beauty San Francisco I was talking to
people Everett Milani and she said
something that how they owned jordana
that Milani and Georgiana are the same
brand I was like are you kidding me on
mom jordana Jordana best lash extreme
like that was my holy grail for average
Organa bus / extreme and then I forgot
about it so I don't have it but I love
that mascara it is so good it is so good
I think I get them at walgreens I maybe
I will run into Georgiana products you
can buy them off their website or you
can get them at walgreens and you have a
walgreens you're like three bucks it's
such a good mascara it's so good totally
worth I mean if I would I would expect
that to have been a high on mascara like
and it's three dollars it's so good it's
so good um next one that I've forgotten
recently is the tart tortoise of hate
liner this is a really fun product it's
very unique it comes it's like this and
then you take a brush and you squeeze a
little bit of this isn't the brush that
came with it but I think a news if you
just want a very thin liner brush you
can use a point in one or you can use it
a slanted and the one I really like the
slant of angle ones and get some product
down if Lee it's not dead ok and then
CEO if you can see but a little bit of
product came out and then I'm gonna rub
the brush into this little Bowl here and
it helps you get the right amount of
product on there because you can wipe it
off onto the bowl or you can get and go
back and dip and get more and then BAM
it's so black so black it dries down so
nicely I can't know if it drives down to
net or not I think it drives down Matt
missing I think I'm pretty sure it dries
down in that I'll tell you in a second
yup it's drying down in that if that may
be more of like a satin kind of finish
but it looks like coal to me it looks
like cold no that's pretty mad us mad
and it's just such a nice slider it's
really easy to work with it's very very
creamy i'm at the during the day it will
smudge so i don't recommend doing moline
with this because it will smudge through
the day but just putting it on your
upper lash line so easy to work with if
you're not used to using like
for lashline liner it's like using a pen
so you know practice drawing straight
lines on a piece of paper I know that
sounds stupid but if you get in practice
if you're bored let's say you're sitting
in an office meeting and you're bored
out of your mind practice drawing
straight lines not kidding because it
will help you when you get to a
situation where you need to draw a
straight line here draw them sideways
back and forth on your paper is to
practice drawing straight lines or give
a piece of notebook paper practice
tracing that all those lines on the
notebook paper like this and I promise
you it will help you with your eyeliner
game is that weird to say I've never
said on camera I've always thought that
but I've never said it because whenever
I was bored and faculty meetings I
always draw on my new book paper but and
I really glad you helped my eyeliner
game I do that maybe it's just a theory
but I do I think that helped all right
also my husband being a tattoo artist he
talks about the importance of practicing
drawing of course for tattooing and
makeup is an art and the more you can
gain control of your hands the better
you're going to be at your art whatever
that may be so including makeup so just
a suggestion for you I see arwen says
gel liner is amazing i love the ink wat
gel liners yes Julie says Jenna bought a
few shades in those holidays special
packaging I thought about getting those
jewelry miss makeup fabulousness says i
love the essence false lash effect yes
that's a good one beauty bye birdie says
Kat Von D tattoo liner is he's used
totally agree Gina says nothing wrong
with drawing for muscle memory same in
quilting nice Gino good to know I hadn't
thought about that arwen says CBS has
essence nice melissa says to face so far
as my favorite liquid liner that one's
overly the 10 is that talk I think it
might be tart so fine is it tart so fine
am I wrong here i don't know i could be
wrong you could be right but so far yes
let's see my fav is the steel of penn
jensen the seal of one is excellent
Sadie says I found the essence mascara
smudges so bad on me but they are so
good when you took them on yeah and they
mess which one oh that particular
essence once muttered smudges on you try
the lash princess I really like the lash
princess all right when says tattoo
artists are hot totally agree I married
one eep your soul
gel eyeliner is the easiest for me to
use yeah definitely I think some people
are scared of Joan Rivers but i think
they weren't part of me working all
right let's move on so excited about
some of these products on this table all
right let's go on to cheeks let's do
cheek products and then we'll do lips
and then we'll be done we have about 20
minutes left all right I've got pop-ups
happening over here you close my pops up
and see what's happening 23 minutes all
right say Dean says Mashburn's us yeah
that's agreed agreed Terry says tart is
so good when it comes to liner and when
I met the people over at art a
generation who knew that's what I told
them I said you know what your most
underrated product even liners I did
recently thanks to my friend Rosie I
have this this is coming to the channel
I cannot wait to review this for you
because you guys know how much reviews
these think this thing has done and I
cannot wait to review it for your movies
at once I'm not ready to review yet but
I'm so excited to review this for you
because y'all know I'm gonna break it
down y'all now I'm going thank you Dave
all right let's go to cheeks so another
product that i forgot about bronzer wise
Bahama Mama by the bomb haven't used
this in forever two great bronzer I have
use this for contouring some but it is a
little bit warm for contouring just kind
of have to keep it high you know like
keep it on like a higher contour because
I feel like it's a little bit one for
you for convoy but it can work it just I
kind of make it more blushy and then
just bring it down the tiny bit toward
the contour line yes this one's really
really good lasting powers fantastic
you've never tried the bombs blushes or
bronzers you need to jump on it who cut
they are so stinkin good I am working on
another bomb brand review i have a
really really old one from a couple of
years ago Flocka products there's so
many more and the bomb i can safely say
the bomb is now my favorite makeup brand
it used to be two-faced and I think the
bomb has jumped over top of to face
because they're more consistent
so yes ball brand with you next 14
highlighters have two for you that I
forgot about forgotten blush clinique
and tawny so great Gina says nice ELISA
is yes since you didn't gets good for
for Health Trust chocolate palette i am
not going to go there i could but i'm
not going to go there this one ofra also
loves a lot of youtubers this is a
fantastic highlighter palette and I
forget where I got this excuse me I know
I didn't pay for it i think i got it in
the boxy charm love love love love love
and actually I'm used it in forever I
love that there's all these different
shades this one I stay away from all my
cheeks because it's way too dark for me
but if you have a deeper skin tone of
course it's gonna look gorgeous I plan
to stick to up here i have used this is
an eyeshadow it's beautiful he's can
double as a shadows oh my gosh this is
an amazing highlighter this is probably
one my favorite highlighters of all time
totally got buried in the back to
Charles it go yeah i forgot about the
over blush strikes illuminating amazing
another one that got lost in the drawer
which is a good favorite is the mineral
fusion i picked this up at whole foods
because they sell this brand at Whole
Foods the highlighter came about to
charm last year stephanie says i think
you're right i think you're absolutely
right this is called the illuminating
powder radiance eliminating power and
it's got these for this quad here these
four shades and they are gorgeous they
are a little powdery but then go on the
cheeks beautifully and they are really
blushing highlighters if you like that
if you a lot of texture and you're
skinny by one stay away from issue i
want stay with me over to but if you
don't have a lot of texture on your skin
oh my goodness oh my goodness but
they're also like kind of um they're
really glow but they don't glow to the
point where it's going to look weird to
have a chunk of glow as a blush you know
what I mean um they're very very soon
also double as our shadows as well and I
just love the way they look on the cheek
so beautiful I have some people actually
I feel like I want to put this on I feel
like even though I got no makeup face I
got low concealer I got a little browse
on but I think that
that happen and makeup on let's put a
little bit of one thing I like to do is
I like to mix these two together that we
want to top off your josh because it's
very powering this so i can show you how
this goes on and then below no that's
pretty from space you see that it's
pretty bright yeah yeah the other reason
why I wanted to do that is because I
could remember how from space it was
it's pretty from space but i loved it i
really like it a lot i'm going to do the
other side just so that I match it's a
nice blush topper to moderators are
working it this morning good job
anything moderators how's it look I get
away with this blue wrestling chat but I
really want to wait do I have to tell
you I love the way it most even though
it's super glowy do love it Gina says I
seriously am looking for the best
blowing but not shiny highlighter
blowing but not shiny have you tried the
hourglass that would be my
recommendation the hourglass the
original three pan palette where he
wants that the singles that are in the
original through camp palette that's my
my suggestion if you're watching this
really collective brain and you're
watching this on the replays can always
leave comments below as far as things
that you recommend so highlighters that
are glowy but not from space so her best
highlighter for aging skin I always say
the bus always always always I love the
hourglass alright another one for blush
that I forgot about this is the eve girl
blush this I was obsessed with this
obsessed with us and the totally
disappeared this one's great Oh moment
state anna says that search the
beautiful jump on this one they have it
/ stint on to this one is for a light
skin tone you go on their website but
it'll say on specific skin tones they
also have this on look sometimes for her
over the top off but definitely soon it
significantly discounted and it's
definitely worth it lasting power is
fantastic one thing I've done is I've
done this one on the cheats this one as
contour kind of sort of like on the
bottom that kind of striped it out on my
cheeks and then blend it together so
this one on the very top this one in the
middle and then this one on the bottom
down here and then kind of blended it
together to kind of give more of a Oh
Gina I love you um why don't you know
you don't want it stripy but try to give
it more dimension in the blood or you
just know what this and mix them all
together and it's gorgeous absolutely
gorgeous and again they do this by skin
tone so whatever your skin tone is it's
easy to find the bus that you want last
and how is fantastic it's just a little
mix plus and I haven't used it in a
while just how you used a polar pop I
lighters or steps holy grail eloquent
highlighters are amazing they really are
and that's another one then I just don't
don't use lupe is here the star of the
show the reason why we're all here today
hello good to see Vanessa says hard
candy chica Brooke Tiki bronzer don't
own it don't know why I I'm good all
right I was reading comments I've
comments from you videos that pop up
here okay let me say oh one more blush
forgotten favorite cargo I don't like a
lot of cargo it's it's hard for me to
find a cargo product that I like this is
a good one that's called most cabos and
it's this Corley shade it looks scary
but I promise you it's not on the cheeks
it is so beautiful so beautiful blondes
would love this um anyone with blue eyes
or great eyes definitely I don't know as
far as deep skin tone probably because
it's so pigment it's so commented but
you have to let that poorly kind of tone
but the last how on this is in same like
it is it will look exactly the same at
the end of the day as it does beginning
Dana actually want to do a normal skin
so definitely keep that in mind but oh
my gosh amazing arwen says I've never
heard of cargo there
reason for that because most cargo
pockets this is an exception this one is
really really good that you up set this
up at the Birchbox shop I'm pretty sure
they sell it at twilight homes I think
they sell cargo I shadow pouch are
variant mess I've gotten one I should I
pop a moment I liked and a couple that i
do not like but yeah Tracy says I don't
like cargo either with this blush these
losses are remember these are the
swimmer bowls i believe water resistant
yeah they call me swimmable oh my
goodness they say that it's waterproof I
don't know I've never tested that but i
really like it a lot it's pretty stinkin
awesome all right let's move into lip
product we've got about 15 minutes left
let's see Gina says I have a little
cargo quad kinases clearance and i love
it on that shows yes that's the one what
I like right here all right it's right
here this one ah ok I've talked about
this a couple times but i don't use is
it it's not forgotten I've known that
it's there i don't use it as much as
should this is the cargo warm neutrals
palette I think this is what you're
talking about or at least something like
this this one's really really really
good this one I got going way back I got
it in a little black bag and no way back
little like that was one of the coolest
inventions ever it was a makeup like it
was like a game and in the end you get
purses and your shoes and makeup and all
kinds of cool stuff in jewelry I got so
much I mean it was it was a good game
you play I have a bunch of videos on
little buck by if you look back about
old videos you can see more about it I
don't spend too much time on it but I
was obsessed with little black bag and
then they shut down because I guess that
they were getting way too much stuff or
something but this is something I got
another little black bag and oh my gosh
I also spent a lot of my i probably
spent six or seven hundred dollars on
the black bag in my life on that look
but i got thousands of dollars worth of
stock especially proces I have so many
purses kind of stupid all from little
black bag anyway remember I having a
banca trunk I have a nerve uncle Trump
bad and i got from little black
but I have to get off this topic so i
can go on forever Laura's like I
remember little of that oh my gosh i
love good a little bit of success okay
anyway moving on to lips these right
here these Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain I have so many of these these
are just the ones that I pull it off the
top and never use these and we're so
stinking good and I like every formula I
like the mat once I'm like the glossy
wasn't like the regular ones they're so
sick good and I don't know why I don't
reach for them anymore like this one is
so gross it's so good this one is in the
shade precious i use this to all break
at least i used to i guess the last time
I didn't i'm wiping it on my towel I
always give a towel on my lap when I do
this so that i think my flow is clean
but and it's also a nice topper to kind
of calm down actually i don't even use
this for auburn acting on the scope and
use this as a topper to gloss up or calm
down other shades and this one is really
really good these are all like this
whole formula it's amazing doesn't have
lasting power nope no long-lasting power
at least for me I'm actually no that's
not true that long since I've use them
unless I think some of them do have a
longer lasting power I can't remember
but I can't remember I'm not going to
talk to it because right now I on what
spacing on it whether the lasting power
is good I'm feeling like they do leave a
long lasting stain on your lips genesis
i heard they discontinued the balm
stains that one made me cry Danny don't
make me cry are you probably looks today
but I realized I was late Jack what's he
deep I birdie said I would love a video
products that didn't work out you ended
up returning I do have I have a video
but it soon well it's kind of old I
should do a different one Joyce says I
told that sucked into the lip balm
sticks I have all of them i never use
them need to bust them out I know
they're really good laura says she wants
to buy my could find anymore well isn't
that sound laura says they do stay
anymore that's often Sally bear get off
that topic then make noise of stops Elmo
dress thanks
all right let's get off that topic that
I'm a super high-end one this is
somebody was talking about on social I
earlier I did get a social ah box once
from them and this was one of beauty
samples they sent social ah is a luxury
be sampling program it is a subscription
box and you pick out let me show you get
to pick out so I my nose is like all
stuffy okay i'm pretty sure you get to
pick out which samples you want to try
so this is the cabin of quantum lip
gloss and blood roses oh my gosh this is
an amazing lip gloss you can see what
color it is and it's very deep and when
you put it on and looks like that it is
just I'm going to put it on my lips so
you can see and it's funny because they
really liked my review and they actually
sent me a full size of this and I
couldn't find it
so when you put it on alone it just
depends up your lips just a little bit
and it's gorgeous it's absolutely
gorgeous you see how it's not like
overpowering me right what it looks like
in the in the container it's just
beautiful and it's really nice in the
top right of deep enough other lipstick
so if you're using something like this I
mean leg or you can put this over top
and it will deepen it up a little bit
it's really really really like a lot
another one other ones new ones i I've
lost and forgotten about charts Park
Avenue princess lipstick is another good
one I can mix this together with this
may be a little unusual normally I'll
put the gloss on top the lipstick but I
think about it so we're just gonna go
back one today and now that's mixed but
it's like a your lips but better kind of
shade it's a really pretty free um you
swatch it over here so you can see it's
like I'm glossy we go carolyn says i
love my sample the why sell lips a man i
got yes yes what's up with the lip
butters one on a minute when I miss I
miss something about lip butters hold on
a minute I something check Emily well
haha minute Sarah says oh yes just
started the social wall subscription in
its genius its felled soch oh I ex and
they actually contacted me on to ask me
if I wanted to review again and I said
that I would review in December so um Oh
Laura says the lip butters are

the Revlon lip butters Thank You Laura
Revlon lip butters not maybe in the
photos that see you make sense they're
going to say that long even the brothers
it sounds wrong Revlon lip butters yes
but I did really like that formula oh my
gosh oh my gosh all right so nars dolce
vita is another one it's very similar to
the tart it's just it's got more color
it's another one that I've forgotten
about it's really good it's very nice so
it's just so got a little bit more of a
tone to it um does tart have lip butters
maybe it's hard to start having fun on
my brain is like mom turned off colonel
and then the last one that I wanted to
show you in the Lord Geller air whipped
the lip where lush lightweight superior
coverage if this one is in sweet candy
moose listens is beautiful for people
that are looking for a little bit of
sparkle on your lips a little bit of
shine says I find my gold should be

JLo new lisa says I'm Briana says Jen
you have any noise lipsticks this one I
don't think I got any other words norms
is one of those brands that has been so
Miss for me it just made me mad so I
booked up a lot of noise you get that
bad taste in your mouth for a brand when
something doesn't work out and spent a
lot of money right it's like that's what
happen we need from
so if I didn't buy a whole lot I just
like their products are just so standing
expensive so expensive and i can't i
can't justify buying almost understand
so um don't do i guess i'd really like
that this is it worth the price of it I
don't think so honestly like I'm never
going to tell you go out and pay the
money for this but if you got it on
discount a friend want to give it to you

early no says why can't be collective
brain just meet for coffee one someday
this is all
if you would like to be a part of the
collective right we love to hang out
more we do have a collective brain
facebook where you can hang out 24 hours
a day with people on the collective
brain its roots / what's up in makeup
and we have about 8,500 members at this
point and i think there's about 300
people waiting to get in so if you do
apply to be a member of the facebook
group just know that we're trying
there's a bunch of us over there admits
we screen every single person that comes
into facebook groups so it does take a
while and if you are an unlucky one and
you try to become a member and you have
get 300 people on top of you it takes a
while to get to you so if you're waiting
to get it to the group just know we're
thinking about you we will be clearing
the queue in the next couple of days so
but if you are not at the facebook group
it's a great place to be you run a super
tight ship we make sure that everybody
is treated with respect of course come
in and they can read jerks but then they
get removed or to get a stern talking to
we give it a great place so if you're
not I remember the facebook / thing you
want to be part of collective brain 24
hours a day that's the place to be if
you let see what else are if you want to
know a products that were shown in the
