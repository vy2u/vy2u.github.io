friends and welcome to the lives of the
make up weekly chat it is so good to see
you all I fret to put my microphone
helps if I put my microphone on let's
try that again no my friends welcome to
the woods if we make up weekly chat it
is so good to be here hopefully the
sound is OK I forgot to put microphone
on and I was sending an email and I
would like right before I went on and I
just forgot to put my mic on so you know
that's what happens when you go live you
never know what's gonna happen on the
live stream because you can't out of it
that's just the way that it is I hope
everybody is doing well today we're
gonna be doing my generation beauty haul
and yes this is kind of a PR haul but
the purpose of this video is to kind of
show you the things that I got so I can
know what you want me to focus on as far
as review even if it means just to put
something in a favorites and fails video
if I can't do a full review of it I'm
also going to be cutting back on my what
the K shows the the series what the K
that's on Mondays then the reason why is
because I know that like the two to
three thousand people that watch that
show that that show I don't know if you
want to call it a show but that series
on my channel absolutely love it I mean
I'm getting constantly rave reviews
about it from the people that watch it
but in the end it's I'm spending a lot
of money in order to keep up with that
series and that's kind of what it comes
down to is it's a very expensive series
to maintain and it is the least
profitable of all of my of all my video
so it's kind of that return on
investment kind of things so I do still
want to do them I'm just not going to be
doing them as much so what I can do is
instead I can do like mini like
five-minute reviews on some of the
products that you're seeing here and
kind of give you more information on
things that are more readily available
other than just k-beauty
I only still want to do it because I
personally absolutely love the series
and I'm really good inside that but I
have to kind of slow it down but you
know you have if they take you that this
is my full-time job so I have to make
sure that my investment in the time I'm
spending on different content that it's
paying off you know my husband looks at
me is like Jen why are you even doing
this
spending so much money on it it's like I
know because I like it
so I am still gonna do it my point is
but the other point is is that I'm gonna
use some of this gem beauty stuff to
kind of fill in those spaces every other
week or so alright so before I get into
oh the other thing I wanted to mention
before I say hello to the people in the
collective brain is that I want to let
you know that I am going to be talking
about what happened earlier this week
with my Jaclyn hill video that I created
and how I'm currently feeling about it
we're gonna talk about that like the
last 10 to 15 minutes of this chat so if
you're interested in how I'm currently
feeling about that video which is not a
positive feeling just so you know a
little spoiler not having a positive
feeling about that video but I want to I
want to talk about it so we'll talk
about it at the end of chat in case
you're interested you can skip to like
the 45 minute mark and see if I'm
talking about it if you're watching this
on the replay but anyway let me go ahead
and say hello to the people that are
here in the collective we have Tam is
here nadine is here nancy is here
christina is here and sherry and tabitha
in the house amber is here and tracy and
reading mom is here that she tells me
her name every single time and I forget
because I'm an airhead apparently allie
is here and nicole from the irony Nicole
who I need to text back that I was busy
with the family all day and when I text
you back I like to actually text you
something thoughtful and I just haven't
had a minute to text you something
thoughtful yet but I'm thinking about
you Nicole Priyanka is here I hope I
said that Priyanka I hope I said that
right hello to you and maan 4:20 love
beauty hello to you Oh Monica hello
Monica best way to be on the ER your I
hope you're not going to the ER that
would be terrible
doing that Rachel and AJ in the and
esterline and Michelle good to see you
she says you look turned out great glad
you tried out the halo I do a sunset
halo with the Carli bybel palette I did
do a halo eye with the Laura Lee palette
I don't feel like what you're looking at
all my eyes is doing it justice you can
go to my snap
which is Jen laws reviews if you want to
see the halo I that I did today with the
Laura Lee palette the camera is not
great here I'm learning when I looked
back on the replay of the Laura Lee the
Laura Lee video I feel like what the
palette is important as this since the
reviews coming out I watched a couple
more and I was kind of like like we
really need to do well as influencers to
make sure that we are giving a hundred
percent into these reviews that's what
I'm gonna kind of leave that so I feel
like that the livestream that I did you
couldn't really see a look very well so
definitely keep an eye out for this full
review of this palette is coming I'm
hoping next Friday I want to film next
Wednesday so I'm using it everyday until
then speaking of that before I get into
the hall I did want to show you what
else is coming up on the channel carry
cosmetics was kind enough to send me a
couple of their pallets unicorn dreams
and Just Peachy it's not sponsored I
have no obligation to review them but I
do want to dig into these and I would
really love to do a full review on the
channel of those I also wanted to show
you that my friend Nancy was kind enough
to Nancy that's here was kind of to send
me the Kat Von D Satan's sitter palette
I'm having a tough time with this I'm
gonna be getting help from my friend
Nicole at yerin a Nicole she just did
her first look as she's gonna do a bunch
of look at my tree because I request I
was like please Nicole if you figured
out this palette please help me so she
did the first look with this palette on
her channel so if you're you've bought
this after you're curious how to use
this definitely recommend going over to
Nicole's video now that I have time to
breathe I'm going to be watching it
tonight I haven't seen it yet but I'm
really looking forward to seeing it
because I'm having a heck of a time with
that palette so far my friend Jenny T
was also kind enough to get me the
Natasha - no Anna Lila palette so this
is another video that I would absolutely
love to do a full review on on the
channel so I did want to show you those
even though those are not generation
beauty-related
I did want to show you those okay so
let's go ahead and get into this haul a
nice school or scroll down a little bit
Stef says hashtag not sponsored stuff by
the way
Stef it's the moderator on here she
actually is the one that got me saying
hashtag not sponsored I give her full
credit for that B Ferrell says that
Fanta song on what's of a makeup was
amazing the Sephora worker is great and
I actually am
not I got I got a copyright issue on I'm
putting that in my video so I'm now
revenue sharing on this week's what's up
in makeup but it is what it is I really
feel like it's a great thing and it's
totally worth revenue sharing to share
her revenue sharing means that I'm
sharing money from my video with the
people who created the background music
for that song but I feel like it's
totally totally worth it if you have not
seen the song on whatsapp and make up
about the Fenty make up being out of
stock from Sephora you definitely need
to check it out it's probably bout the
ten minute mark on whatsapp in makeup
today
hopefully my glare on my glasses isn't
too bad I moved my light so hopefully
it's not so bad now but anyway let's go
ahead and get into the hall so the first
thing that I got was the impressions
glow meet light this goes on your phone
like this and then when you're taking a
selfie you turn the light on so that it
it you know goes on your face I was
using the some at generation Beauty the
only critique I have about this so far
is that oh it's got different brightness
to you can bump up the brightness on it
is that it's just really big so you
can't I can't really keep it on there
and then just kind of pull it out so
it's one of those you put it in your
purse you take it out when you're ready
to use it and then you put it back
Steph says that's my girl Molly glad you
love the video I loved it she did such a
nice job Jane said I wish I had that
Natasha - no no pants where half the
size so the palette could be cheaper I
am so with you on that Jane so with you
sherry says she likes my glasses Thank
You Sherri I appreciate that okay so
then I got some things these are from
Ike a igk beauty by GK Beauty igk New
York igk New York these were given to me
this one was given to me by GK these
were given to me by my friend Amanda
that runs Bridal Beauty magazine she
knew she wasn't going to use them so she
gave them to me there's a pink color
spray a blonde color spray and then a
purple color spray they are very very
similar in my opinion to the ones that
you can get at like you know for
Halloween or whatever the haircolor
spray but I feel like they look more
natural they kind of blend more into the
hair instead of making it look like it's
just paint on the hair so that's one
thing I really like about these
especially the blonde the blonde is
really fun
by the end of the day they do kind of
fade a little bit but but so far I'm
really enjoying those the glitter that I
had in my hair from for the Jacqueline
Hill video that a lot of people really
didn't like that glitter was from igk it
just came out at Sephora but it was
still in my hair from the event that's
why my hair was so glittery in there
summer says you can get ring lights for
much cheaper on Amazon that don't need
batteries just a USB charger I recommend
those Thank You summer so much for that
I appreciate that you said you said last
year I was the only one with one of
those this year they're everywhere Chen
beauty oh my gosh that's too funny
Tracy said I've heard so much about igk
lately I'm excited to try them yes they
are available at Sephora okay this is
something I actually purchased this is
from glow recipe this cost me $30 I
bought it for what the K and that was
when I was kind of like I'd already been
kind of toning down on what the K and
that's what kind of solidified my needs
a toned to help with the K this is a
blueberry bounce gentle cleanser and a
watermelon glow sleeping mask and just
$30 for two sample sizes I was just like
oh but the ingredients look amazing so I
really wanted to try these for you and
they do smell like blueberries and
watermelon so I'm very very excited to
to try these for what the case so those
will be coming on the channel I'm kind
of checking Monique says hi everybody
I'm multitasking with you and football
go Texans aye Monique you know what I
appreciate you because I know you were
on my video comments earlier saying
you're messing with my football time I
appreciate that you're here I know
that's a big deal and I I completely and
totally like I'm very thankful and
honored that you would even think about
missing a moment of football in order to
watch me like that's a huge honor I
totally get it
this here is from nude sticks and I
actually already have the shade but I
love it so much that I got another one
they did give this to me this was the
freebie that was given out at their
booths if you don't know you can go as
an attendee or a creator the Krait
creators are part of the Ipsy community
so people that have blogs or Instagram
pages or YouTube channels and with you
get more if you're a creator in that you
get well that's not even true I can't
even say that because that's not true
this year that's a whole nother story
that I could go into for five minutes
that I'm not going to but eat a creator
and attendees can walk go and wait
through a line and get a free product so
this was the free product they were
giving out at nude sticks this is the
magnetic matte lip color I've really
been enjoying these last last time and I
think it was in Toronto they gave me a
full set of them they're so good very
very long-lasting and very comfortable
they're kind of a nice alternative to
liquid lipsticks and that they're more
comfortable uh I I am s Canon I know you
have another name too and I see you all
the time and I adore you
footballer Jen no contest Jen wins I
think there are a lot of people that
would disagree with that but I
appreciate you so much
but anyway from my personal experience
with these I absolutely love these now
this is something that's really really
exciting and I was sad to hear someone
commented today on whatsapp and makeup
that these aren't available on the on
the deluxe II Beauty website this is the
Jasmin collection and they were kind
enough to give this to me for review I
will be using these in videos coming up
but I wanted to show you them clean
specifically in this video first and now
I'm about to dig into them so this is
the package that you get this is $95 for
these brushes and they are the same
brushes as the regular Luxy brushes that
you can get for I think they're like you
know between ten to twenty dollars a
piece $25 piece maybe individually but
they also have the you know the Disney
trademark on them these are in
collaboration with Disney and they've
got these really beautiful handles so
that's really what you're paying for is
you know this beautiful box and you're
paying for the design of them and
they're absolutely gorgeous if you've
never tried lucky brushes I definitely
recommend them they are super fab the
eye set is my favorite they also sent me
the Wonder Woman brush set which was
also amazing super excited about these
there's also a single brush that they
gave me but I don't have that right here
it's in one of the bags I'll show you
when I get to it
Lizzie says she can't wait for their
review awesome dawn says says says I
just want those brushes for the
packaging dawn says I did say for people
who can't stand or a handicap that they
did have to get a heads heads up to them
before attending so they could
care of them that's good to know thank
you dawn for that that if you have a
disability where you're having trouble
walking or standing in lines you need to
let them know ahead of time thank you so
much for that because that is so
important so important
let's see dawn says lucky as gorge I
want the Wonder Woman said it really is
a nice brush set the found the flat top
kabuki brush in there and the blush
brush are my favorites in that
collection dawn says expect more when
it's a club yeah because it's got the
whole Disney thing absolutely alright
let's go ahead into one of my bags here
let's do this one this was with this was
the bag from creator day so creator day
is specifically for some content
creators so Instagram blogs youtubers
kind of giving us tips and tricks on how
to improve our whatever platform we are
on so they gave us a couple of things
they gave us one of these karma water
bottles H to go I do have one of these
silicone water bottles that I got enough
fabfitfun and I love it I really didn't
think that was gonna be anything magical
like it's a glass water bottle with a
rubber outside like why is this thing
cool but I do enjoy drinking of it I
thought my water tastes better out of a
glass bottle is that weird or what like
I feel like that with milk to that like
milk tastes better out of glass than it
does out of plastic so and it says
creator day on it it's super cute I
haven't used it yet but I will
definitely be using it because I
chokingly actually see a difference with
a glass water bottle I don't know why
it's so weird let's see where is the
Bella collection from I have visitors
and I'm not paying attention to them Oh
Bella collection I don't know what you
mean by are you talking about the Jazmin
collection I think that might be what
you're talking about
the Luxy brushes is that what you're
talking about I hope Taylor says yes
glass tastes better well there you go
it's not just it's not just me Leah says
that plastic gives off chemicals there
you go okay well I guess I'm not alone
in that cover effects gave us the
perfect setting powder I haven't even
opened this yet I was doing the review
of the Too Faced line so I did not need
to open any new setting powder I haven't
decided whether I'm gonna try this or
not so I'm excited to hear what you all
think whether you would want or
review on the cover effects perfect
setting powder I really need to know
because I might just save this for a
giveaway since I do have a lot of
setting powders and I don't know if a
setting powder is something that people
will be super interested in a full
review on because I can only review so
much in a year you know Alana says yeah
same with coke electric coconut glass
well there you go
and Sylvia says plastic leeches
chemicals into the water well now I know
you know I've heard about like the I
forget what it is and in beat bpa I
think it's what it is I remember when my
kids were babies everything's had to say
like bpa-free or whatever it was so I
remember that Ally says she brought the
two-faced peach powder because of me I
hope you love it as much as I do because
I you I love it I have no connection
with Too Faced I'm it's not we're not
it's just I love it it's a genuine thing
it's genuine thing and even if I did I
connection with Too Faced you guys know
that's you know I am alright Mariam Mac
welage plus pixie she was there it was
very nice to see her on the stage and in
talking about working with pixie and
everything this is the strobe and bronze
sets I don't know whether I would use
this or not or whether I should save
this for giveaway so this is another
thing I really need your input on for
that because I don't I don't know
whether that's something you would want
to see or not actually let me get my
discard bag I have an empty bag here to
put my stuff in that I've talked about
so let me put some of the stuff in here
and organize so I don't end up with this
giant mess okay I do a little discard
pile here alright so now we have this is
the did I get this one a minute okay
this I got somewhere else let me hold
off on that for a second okay Kendra
Scott this is a necklace we had the
choice this was really cool Kendra Scott
was set up and they were hand putting
jewels into either earrings a necklace
or a bracelet and I chose a necklace you
could choose the kind of metal that you
wanted and you chose your stone so this
was the one that I chose I chose silver
and I chose a glittery black stone and
I'm really excited about this I can't
wait to wear this in a video I think
it's going to be absolutely beautiful on
camera
so super excited about that I don't know
if I would do a review on this but I do
want to show you how pretty it is
and I think you can get these at
department stores I'm not sure which one
but I know that it's Kendra Scott is the
name of the brand dantos coverfx taking
notes our CMA I hear is amazing too yes
I've heard great things about our CMA
Lisa says that the two face powder
better than Laura Mercier no I would say
it's about the same though in the two
faces a little I believe a little more
fine the powder really kicks up with it
so that leads me to believe it's a
little more fine but I wouldn't say it's
better at least on my normal skin but
it's about the same it just adds that
peachy scent and the sugary taste which
I like oh no Megan says it keeps
freezing
hopefully it's not freezing for anybody
else oh no you saying it says hi can you
say hi to my sister Carol hi Carol how
are you Carol I see you and make them
through the computer I see you through
the screen you're very beautiful is that
creepy I think that's really creepy skin
Iceland solutions for stress skin the
skin Iceland is kind of one of those
I've tried this brand I bought a bunch
of so let me start over
I've bought a bunch of stuff from this
brand back before published twice I got
one of those like little kits that had a
bunch of sample sizes in it from skinned
Iceland and I really really liked it a
lot
I brought all my skin Iceland products
to Iceland with me because they were
travel sized and that's what I had so I
do have a fresh memory of these they do
have a cooling feeling to them which is
really really cool and the ingredients
are good they're not amazing but they're
good this is the Arctic hydration rubber
izing mask since it isn't Korean beauty
I probably won't be reviewing this on
what the K but I could talk about it if
you guys were interested I could talk
about it in another video summer says
it's freezing here to just leave and
come back okay good Florie love's skin
iceland I do too you should have heard
me talking to them about about taking
their stuff to Iceland I don't know if
they're I don't think they're in Iceland
based company which is kind of weirds me
out a little bit like why are you
skinned Iceland if you're not based in
Iceland I don't know I need to do more
research on that don't hold me to that
all right next up we
innisfree natural beauty and I didn't
even look at these yet okay these are
putting this app or clearing mask it's a
bunch of masks we got a hydrating
sleeping mask
we got a intensive hydrating serum so
these are things I'm pretty sure this is
k-beauty I don't know nope amore Pacific
yeah I'm wearing Pacific as k-beauty
made in Korea so this is something I
could use for what the K there's also a
few other masks in here I don't want to
spend too much time it's real squeeze
mask green tea
oh there's they're just all the green
tea ones in here so I can use this for
what the K it's a Korean beauty of new
line at Walmart oh cool that's very cool
your sister didn't understand what you
were doing oh well well we tried you can
play it for on the replay but that's
great because it's easily accessible see
that's my biggest thing about what the K
is that I get a lot of my stuff from
Amazon and it's like and I herb I herb I
herb I think it's how you pronounce it
so it's it's nice to have something
that's that's more accessible so that's
even a better vote for doing that that's
great
I got a pop socket from Ipsy I don't
know if I'm gonna use an EPS II pop
socket let me show you my pop socket
that I bought though look I'm not
sponsored by pop socket they have no
idea who I am but I love my pop socket
oh my gosh I love this thing if you
don't own a pop socket and you have a
phone and you're prone to dropping your
phone pop socket telling you you can do
a custom one like I did or you can use
one of their one of their regular ones
that they have already designed I think
it's like ten dollars versus fifteen
dollars or something like that for the
for the ones that you design versus
other ones versus the ones that they've
already designed so yes if see pop
socket that's kind of cool I haven't
even showed anybody this what's up a
makeup one because every time I film
it's on the back of my phone so I never
I never I know if no one ever gets to
see it because I'm like always live
streaming on my phone
Julie says how do I get one I can send
you the graphic and you can order one if
you want to I'm not selling them I don't
have any like I don't have any like how
cute is that pop second I know thank you
I don't have any affiliation with them
but maybe sometime
the future I might have an affiliation
with them and sell these I don't know
what you guys buy or what to make a pop
socket I love this thing
Shirley loves our pop stockings you
can't live without it I know that's what
I'm saying
I'm totally with you Monique says I just
saw a new Korean makeup print at Walmart
last week I don't remember the exact
name no no that might have been it and
it's free that might have been it Cheri
says I just changed from a pop socket to
a ring socket oh that sounds interesting
cool man
okay so then we got this it says Jem
inspired an arrow inspired nail lacquer
this is from Kendra Scott it's a nail
lacquer and my box got wet from from my
water bottle that was in there but this
is the nail polish and one thing already
I know that it's gonna be difficult for
me is holding on to this weird shaped
top I think might be a little bit
difficult this is a very sheer shade
which is not my personal preference so I
will probably end up giving this away to
a neighbor I've learned not to mail nail
polishes and perfume it's just a bad
idea so Teresa wants to know what a pop
stock it is basically what it is is you
stick it on the back of your phone and
then you can hold your phone like this
without having to worry about dropping
it so it's just really it's nice to not
have to worry about like it stays on
your hand like really well so and it's
like kind of cute and fashionable kind
of thinks they like diamond crusted buns
and things like that Shirley says pock
socket has wholesale accounts available
my hobbies doing it for his karate
school really well that's interesting
we'll have to look into that if people
might want them I don't know have those
like okay okay we'll talk to them
Tabitha is my production manager in case
you didn't know we also have the Ipsy
fidgets spinner I haven't even opened it
yet I should give this to my son because
I don't think he has a fidget spinner my
daughter does so can I do it no all
right I it's 523 and I haven't even
gotten anywhere close to this stop
playing Jen okay so next up I went to
the OGX if you don't know Oh G X they
are a hair brand I went to a party that
they were throwing before the cocktail
party and I got this and I used it and
it was amazing I don't use it once
though I use it while I was there and
then I kind of forgot about it
like since I taken a shower since then
so this is the Maui moist
thickening restore bamboo fibers blowout
miss for weak brittle hair which is
totally me totally me so I used it when
I was there when I was saying in my
Airbnb and it was amazing the amount of
volume that I got so yes on this from
the one-time use I'm gonna continue
using it to make sure that I can fully
recommend it from the one-time use I was
super impressed with this okay so moving
on let's see okay that's my discard bag
okay let's keep going because we really
only have like 20 more minutes okay we
have two non cracker kits that was my
emergency food we don't need that let's
drop that to the side okay so this is
the luck seeing brush that's this that's
the single that you can go again I think
it's like $40 something like that woah
but it's this giant powder brush and
it's so incredibly soft it's what you
would expect from like a soft powder
brush it's again I haven't used these
yet but the design goes all the way down
on it and it does say Jasmine here and
it says Luxy 518 on the side so yes
definitely Ashley says she doesn't
understand fidget spinners I kind of get
it I kind of get a few spinners a little
bit sort of they're kind of fun rachel
says oh my gosh I love oh gee X shampoos
and conditioners they have a nice smell
they do they definitely do Jamie says
love the Maui shampoo conditioner bought
it at Walmart fabulous yeah this is its
look at the packaging for real for real
I mean I was just so thankful that they
gave them to me I was like are you are
you serious right now are you serious
right now oh my gosh okay this is okay
so along with the OGX party I went to a
party thrown by my friend Julia salvia
she has a youtube channel that focuses
mostly on tutorials she is insanely
talented insanely beautiful Julia s al
VI so she had a party and then she had a
bunch of brands there and the brand's
gave us some stuff so let me show you
some of the things that we've got so
this is from oh no this is not from them
this is something else okay this was
from actual generation beauty from SoCo
glam okay hold on a minute hold on a
minute getting a little mixed up here
okay so these are pinky these are from a
brand called pinkie swear they're an
Andy brand
they're like pen lips liquid lipsticks I
did try on the one that's jpg on
snapchat if you're not falling on
snapchat I'm sorry that you missed it it
was it was the weirdest looking shade on
me I literally like I had blue eyeshadow
on I literally looked like me me not
literally but I really resembled me me
from Drew Carey Show like with this on
with this neon orange lip and blue eyes
it was crazy
super super opaque but I haven't tested
them enough to know whether I like them
or not because it was like total like
put it on take it off I didn't wear it
very long Banshee News wants to know if
lucky brushes are good yes yes they are
yes if I had to and if I had to tell you
that you should invest in any of them I
would say go with the eye brushes first
they're less expensive and I actually
prefer those like I those stand out to
me more than their face brushes the face
brushes are really good but the eye
brushes like stand out as being extra
good you know what I mean so so yeah so
if you're interested in a review of the
pinky swear ones let me know of these
liquid lipsticks because they're very
interesting in that package they gave us
like a little notebook and some stickers
and stuff sing and just so you know I
did not get an invite to the cocktail
party that they have I usually get
invited I did not get invited so I did
not get the giant creator swag bag that
a lot of people got this is just other
stuff so they she gave me all of these
like we got these at Julia's parties
pinkie swear pens there's like so many
of them they're super neat but again I
have no opinion as far as like the
quality of them and everything okay this
was from OGX this is the fade defying
orchid oil color protect oil with UVA
UVB sun filters I haven't tried that but
that's here and then this is from lumene
this I don't know if I got this at
Julia's party or not I feel like things
got mixed up somehow I don't think I got
this at Julia's party know some of the
stuff is from regular generation Beauty
sorry things got mixed up I tried to get
it to to be organized but I apparently
failed so Simona says hey Jen

was reading something got totally
distracted Jen w u IM is my name on
facebook this is Lumine finland pure
arctic miracle micellar cleansing water

alright Oprah was kind enough to give
their ever blow highlighter again I have
not tested this actually I think I
already have this I think about I might
already have this if I already have it
it's going into my giveaway bag for
feature giveaway the OMG
step one detoxing bubble mask and detox
bubbling microfiber mask this is teh
beauty so this would be fun for what the
K covergirl gave us the total tease
mascara I've already tried this wasn't
the biggest fan of it so this will go
into future giveaway Luxy brushes I
heard I believe I already have this
brush this is a really good brush this
is the three the one three one mini
angled yes I have this in one of their
sets so this will go in for future
giveaway cuz I already have
this is from pop beauty and this is
their Cajal pen it looks like it's a
pencil belt so this will probably go and
give away because I'm not really a big
pencil eyeliner person and I don't want
to waste it Stephanie Davis says first

latina is here my company don't watch
YouTube they don't understand why I have

moms DIY in reviews oh my goodness so
good to see you late but I finally made
it I love Jen shows I never missed them
and never make it here live jr. and the
main inspiration for me starting my
channel oh you are so sweet that's so
awesome
Kat says she's never heard of pop Beauty
if you've never heard of pop Beauty if
you've heard of pixie they're the same
brand Papas I believe supposed to be
kind of the higher end of pixie or pixie
is more drugstore and pop it's supposed
to be more higher-end
from what I understand ivy wants to know
what is if see creator studio it's it
they used to call it FC open studios or
EPS EOS and I think they just change it
to creator studio it's a community of
creators so YouTube Instagram bloggers
and that's how we get invitations to go
to generation beauty which they did give
me an invitation to that and creator day
just not the cocktail party this time
okay so next up make up forever step one
skin equalizer I think I already have a
sample of this ad that I have never used
so this will probably end up in future
giveaway because I don't want to have to
more than one sample I need to try it
once this is the liquid velvet by ciatÃ©
this is a shade that I would wouldn't
wear it's a little bit too orange so
this is going to go in future giveaway
Winky Lux
I will try this though this is the
double matte whip Winky luck seems to be
popping up everywhere lately so I'm
curious to try more from their brand if
I'm talking really fast
because I'm trying to get through all of
this because I'm technically I said I
was gonna stop doing this in about ten
minutes
so mmm Bahama Mama by the balm already
owns that's definitely gonna go in
future giveaway the brioche EO blow-dry
perfection and heat protectant cream
this is awesome for me for travel
because I love this stuff I have a giant
one that I'm about to run out of um and
I think I have a backup of it but I
don't have a travel size so I'm
definitely keeping this it's really
really good it's instead of using a
spray heat protectant it's a cream so
it's very nice this is a pure makeup
sponge I do have a few of these this is
gonna go in for future giveaway the my
deal with these is they're very hard at
first but the more you use them the more
you soften them up they do get a lot
better and I do like them I don't know
if I like them as much as some of my
other beauty sponges like the Beauty
Blender but it is a good sponge it's not
a great sponge for me Kat wants to know
can anyone go to generation Beauty yes
anyone can purchase a ticket to
generation Beauty what you need to do is
stay tuned - what's up and makeup and
eye or you can go over the generation
Beauty website and find out when the
next ones are as soon as they announce
it the tickets are a hundred dollars
they're ninety nine dollars when they
first announced it and then the prices
slowly go up there are discount code now
at least for New York there was a
discount code for each epsy creator so
like Gabriel Zamora and Sydney black and
they all had their own discount code
that brought it back down to $99 so
definitely um you know keep an eye out
for for that when they come up be for
real says she didn't like the sponge I
hated it at first I absolutely hated at
first and after like the sixth or
seventh time it kind of grew on me and I
started to like it it's definitely not
my favorite sponge ever though I'm
totally with you Nadine says I was
shocked I found stuff that hadn't been
open and tested I hate when that happens
when you're like oh my gosh I wanted to
have this and then I forgot about it
derma e radiant glow face oil if you're
interested in a review of this let me
know and I think that might be the end
of this bag
you see nope I got a gimme brow gimme
brow in what shade shade three so this
is gonna go and give away cuz I've tried
that and a glow recipe watermelon glow
sleeping mask so I got a mini of the one
that I bought so there you go
is that it I think that's it for this
bag okay discard this is the only thing
in this bag I got this from the brand
this is from the website so Co glam it's
a place to buy different brands of
Korean beauty so so co glam I really
feel like I want to buy more from
instead of Amazon like not that I'm
hating on Amazon being a huge you know
conglomerate of ridiculousness but it's
nice to buy from a smaller brand like
SoCo clam if I'm gonna get Korean beauty
so they gave us the Neogene dermology
can do it real flower cleansing water
can doula it's a cleanser I guess it's
like a like a water cleanser maybe like
a micellar water sort of and then they
gave the time revolution clear toner
from Missha which I'm very excited about
because I did need a new toner I'm
almost out of my Peter Thomas Roth and
this is the egg white put a perfect pore
cleansing foam pour control from
skin-food I don't have problems with my
pores but I might try this for what the
K just to give you information on like
scent and on ingredients and things like
that for this even though I won't be
able to speak too much to like the
actual use of it which is poor control
alright let's keep it going hopefully
I'm not going so fast that I'm being
annoying Diane says she loves SoCo glam
that is awesome Kimberly says I think
the pure sponge is so hard the yellow
and blue are softer so weird huh that is
weird
that's very weird okay so these oh this
is from pure they gave us two of packs
of their masks I just gave away the Blue
Lotus ones in my last giveaway I've
never tried either one of these this is
the green tea and ginger rejuvenating
sheet mask and this is the green tea and
vitamin C brightening sheet mask I love
green tea as an ingredient I've done a
lot of research on green tea and it just
looks like animes
amazing skincare ingredient based on
what I've researched of course with a
lot of skincare stuff you don't know
like really and truly because a lot of
it isn't fully tested but green tea
seems to be a really good one Cassie
from throat baby
Pasi from Vic is here I got too excited
looks like I'll have to watch the replay
but I'm excited to see what you've got
oh I'm so happy to have you here Cassie
lum-lum la Simona says Misha has my
favorite BB cream I reviewed it and I
liked it I'm with you and it was not has
not been my favorite one that I tried
but it is definitely one that I very
much enjoy ok oh this was my OG x bag
that I got at the OG x party and this
has some more creator day stuff in it
like this I want to talk about this real
quick alright this is the pocket candy
press shadow palette in bubblegum by a
lime crime now dough dear was there at
generation beauty and she was talking
about you know vegan ingredients and you
know how important vegan ingredients are
and how you know we need to you know you
know go more cruelty free and more vegan
and I totally support everybody that
wants to go that route I think that's
amazing but then I read this with a tip
from the community it says on the back
caution shades blow pop and snap not
intended for use in the immediate eye
area really really ill I'm crime
I I'm not trying to sound salty but I'm
a little irritated by that I have to say
I am a little irritated because this is
the way that it is packaged it looks
like an eyeshadow palette and unless you
read that very fine print on the back
let me show you how small the print is
on the back it does not say I shadow
palette it says shadow palette there
dance in the line and then it is the
it's not the last line it's the third
it's a the caution part is right here is
where it starts and then it goes to the
next line where it ends here so it's not
even at the very bottom or like here
where it would stand out for people it's
like mixed in with all the ingredients
I'm not quite sure what
ingredient it is it looks like it's
probably the red seven Lake I think
that's the one the red seven Lake is not
I safe now from what I've heard the
reason why some shades are not i safe is
because of the the staining that can
happen on the eye that that's why they
say that it's not i safe but other than
that it's not really gonna hurt your
eyes that's what I had heard I would
imagine the reason why they did that is
because this is a vegan palate she
cannot use carmine which is a common red
ingredient that is not vegan because
it's made from crushed bugs it's like
bug juice that makes it so I I guess
that's just the red pigment she chose to
use but I I kind of take issue with you
know if you're going to talk about
veganism and cruelty-free and be you
know all about you know the the health
and safety and wonderfulness of animals
you want to keep your customers safe too
and if the FDA says that something is
not safe then we probably shouldn't be
putting it in something that makes it
look like it's for that use it's not
like this looks like it's a lip product
you know what I mean I mean where else
what I mean I guess you could use it as
a blush but there's nothing on here that
suggests that there's face products in
here it looks like an eye product so
that really bothers me so so yeah I did
use the blue shade in here and I
actually really liked it but I I don't
know about this that that really
bothered me it did I have to say it
bothered me Georgia says the Urban Decay
electric palette says the same thing
absolutely you are a hundred percent
right and I had issue with that too
I did and I think it's just one of those
personal choice things and again I don't
think from what I've seen there really
is no harm to the eye it's just the
staining of the the lid but still the
FDA says no I want to listen to that you
know on the whole that's that's my
opinion
okay so let's see what else is in this
bag okay so at the OGX party we got some
fake bake this is the luxurious deeper
bronze flawless darker self tan liquid
who's so funny at the OGX party there
were a lot of Mellon and rich beautiful
women there and they were taking their
fake fake out and like handing it all
the light-skinned people they're like
anybody want this anybody want this
it was hilarious it's like no that
didn't take everybody in consideration
but you know I've never tried anything
like this so I might try it we'll see we
also got a couple of products from OGX
this is the vitamin e shampoo and
conditioner and I haven't ever tried
that nadine says she loves fake fake
cool summer says Urban Decay electric
palette did the same thing but the
pigments were not FDA approved for eyes
but her cub approved in other countries
FDA is way behind other countries but
that's another topic girl
if the eighties again I don't know where
this thing the AEV yeah I'm not really
sure what's going on with this I'm not
I'm I have to look at the ingredients in
this to see like the whitening because I
don't like whitening my skin I like the
like niacinamide like evening out the
skin tone but I don't know Debra says
FDA is pretty conservative on some
things on some things FDA says fructose
is okay yeah I believe so I wouldn't
know why they wouldn't I don't know is
there something with fructose it's not
okay other than the fact that it's
terrible for you meowww says I won't be
supporting Lime Crime so much
controversy with the brand yeah and it's
funny because after I saw Joe tear up on
the stage I was like yeah maybe she's
not so bad after all you know maybe I'll
start buying some Lime Crime and then I
saw that in the eyeshadow palette and I
was like up nevermind
just because I felt like it was a little
bit weird you know yeah Debra says
fructose is fruit sugar yeah that's what
I thought Rachel says it's skipping oh
I'm so sorry if it's skipping I'm so
sorry
skin waiting it waiting is bein the
Philippines that is very true Lee's
absolutely absolutely it's just not my
personal preference and taste but no
judgement to anybody that wants to
that's totally just my personal
preference Cheryl says while I spent
respect the FDA many things are not
approved including hip implants because
I used to sell them on
gotcha I'm sorry that it's skipping I'm
sorry I wish there was something I can
do about it I'm sorry okay so let me
just keep going because we are at the 43
minute mark
this is the what brand is this simply
venom I've never heard of this brand
there's a night cream and a day cream so
if you're interested in that let me know
alright that's it for that bad we still
have more of my friends we still have
more okay these were from from
generation beauty it's just a bunch of
different face masks from this is Ellen
sylia e le NS e li a and this is a
escargot and hyaluronic acid
moisturizing that'll be fun I've never
done a snail product on my channel ever
so I'll be interesting a couple of skin
ice iceland face gels and some skin
iceland eye masks we got a goodie bag
from nyx this is a one of their new slip
tease liquid lipsticks and a vivid
bright and their cleansing milk I'll
show you those real quick so this is the
cleansing milk and then this is the slip
tease I'm curious about that Don says
escargot is snail that is true that is
true and then this is the vivid brights
but that doesn't really look like a
bright shade this is in the shade
hello talked interesting I don't know
what to do these just says cream color
so these for the eyes I would imagine
they're for the eyes but it might be a
nice really really nice all-over base
color
Angelia says that the slip tease is
great fabulous dawn says NYX you're
killing me with the pallet prices I know
right with that $30 pallets on my Laura
Lee video people were saying well they
have to pay the influencers and I can
kind of see that I can kind of see that
got some candy from Lime Crime they had
a little candy bar so hopefully all of
that is stomach safe
oh all right let me see I got a couple
more bags left and again I'd even go to
the cocktail party like
this is not even cocktail party okay
this right here this is from mg s mg s
accessories calm and this was from
Julia's party and I haven't even open
this yet let me know what's in here
IV says I would love to hear about
simply venom or more unknown brands
interested in Etsy makeup but there are
so many to choose from does anyone know
of a good place to look for reviews yeah
I don't know I would love to do more I
would love to do more so there is a
sponge here we've got a matte liquid
lipstick and loveable oh my gosh holy
moly that's some interesting packaging
that's really cool-looking I've never
seen anything like that that's really
cool still a little swatch because I'm
definitely trying this this looks cool
whoo that is a me color that's for me
that's for me
smells like vanilla candy did I get it
on my nose I hope not can it says good
thing you drove instead of flew you'd
need two extra suitcases I know right
well that's what I did when I go when I
go to LA ones in the San Francisco ones
okay here is another liquid lipstick
this one is in the shade frisky I'm just
gonna keep that in here just because
it's I don't want to take up too much
more time got a couple of lip gels this
is mg s accessories they're the lip gels
and a couple of makeup brushes the 3:27
which looks like a face brush and then
this looks like a contour brush the 3:29
these are cool I love indie brides oh my
gosh look at that is that Allison wants
to know if I can do a review on the
brand julep yes I can because I have a
lot of experience with julep makeup a
bunch of other stuff but I will put that
as note that that's something that you
want to see Karen says hi you're alive
we are at round Table Pizza oh yay
that's fun
Elise says what the epic ink eyeliner is
my favorite say it isn't so what what
what's wrong with Nick's epic ink
I love Nick's epic ink
let's watch these
nice Oh No
but maybe want it up and just pack it on
with some glitter mba cosmetic
don't tell me it's being it says James
do not tell me that Knicks epic Inc is
being discontinued I'm gonna cry don't
do that to me
oh Ivy says o beauty pie a beauty pie
review maybe might be a possibility
it looks like it's frozen we frozen ok
ok I think you guys might have missed
the swatch of that pigment that glitter
thing this thing it did not swatch well
I'm used to the NBA cosmetics 1 it did
not do well I think that might have
skipped through so I want to make sure I
do that yeah I'm not I'm not excited
that makes me sad but I am excited about
the liquid lipstick just not excited
about that press glitter pigment I'm
gonna have to play with it and see all
right we got some feline lashes from the
kitten collection feline lashes calm
those look gigantic these are probably
gonna be given away they're too much for
me I've learned that big huge lashes
make my eyes look tiny my cat or some of
their papers I have tried these but it's
been a really long time and then Oh from
mva cosmetics look a look at the
difference I have to show you the
difference I'm so glad I realized that
you guys missed that glitter because I
really wanted to show you that it did
not look very good someone better better
an epic ink better not be discontinued
I'm seriously gonna have to write a
serious angry letter to NYX because that
would be the worst mistake ever to just
continue that in my opinion not that I
have any choice over it this I don't
have this one is chrome alight but look
at the difference between the NBA
Cosmetics and this other one okay so
here's the NBA
that was one swipe this was like four
swipes so definitely on the MBA on the
pressed glitters you do have to use a
glitter glue with them though you can't
just um put those on and expected to see
on your eyes you have to use a glitter
glue have to have to okay just a couple
more things in here we have Dulce is
that how you pronounce it do you see see
II smudge proof eyeliner and beauty for
real eyeliner these are definitely gonna
be giveaway because I don't use those
kinds of eyeliners and then last thing
in here is a brush cleaner and this is
so cute
this is an indie brand a swirl a sparkle
I think is the name of it here we go it
was yep swirl sparkle look at this which
you see this it's called toasted
marshmallow it's goat's milk based so
goat's milk coconut oil palm oil
safflower oil and oat conditioner and
glycerin look at this are you serious
right now any stairs right now
it smells like cupcakes like straight up
like I could eat this oh my gosh oh my
gosh smells amazing I cannot wait to use
this and this is an indie brand so swirl
sparkle I would imagine they're on Etsy
I would hope if that's where they would
be let me see oh there's a card here it
says oh here we go swirl and sparkle
calm there you go and the Instagram is
at swirl and sparkle and the snapchat is
swirl and sparkle handcrafted solid
makeup brush excuse me makeup brush
cleanser made in Chicago which is super
super cool okay I have one more bag for
you and then we'll get into the
Jacqueline Hill thing that I wanted to
touch on before I go because I do want
to talk to you guys about it I think
it's important okay this is the kiss
kiss gave me a bunch of stuff oh I have
two more bags I'm a bag from over to
kiss gave me a bunch of stuff I thought
this was the kiss eyelashes and nails
but I think this is different kiss New
York professional Pro touch makeup
setting spray so what they gave me that
they also gave me a bunch of their
liquid lipsticks this is the kiss
professional New York matte liquid
lipsticks so some of these will probably
be passed on like this bright red I
won't use that but I'll try I'll try
these two these two are more mean and
they gave what else
so if you're interested in this stuff
please let me know we've got a creamy
lipstick I guess it's the same oh this
is different
creamy lipstick is different than the
matte lipstick it's a different formula
um anything else okay here we go we've
got a strobing palette strobing palette
and then the Goddess palette I don't
know the price point on these I think
that's gonna make a difference because I
really want to do more drugstore like
drugstore finds kind of video the
problem is is like every time I go to
strug store and I buy a bunch of stuff I
end up thinking it's like man do I even
want to waste my time like telling
people about this product because it's
just kind of man it's not great it's not
terrible it's just like so I'm waiting
for my drugstore stuff to tell you yes
this is amazing go get it or no this is
terrible stay away from it it's horrible
Physicians Formula
eye primer duo they gave this this is
really really nice I'm excited to try
that because I'm always looking for a
good drugstore eyeshadow primers and
then finally I'll show you the stuff
that Oprah was kind enough to give me
this was because I have I've known that
people over for years and they were
really really nice to give these to me
they gave me the nikkietutorials
highlighter collection which was so kind
of her to give these to me so I have
glow goals I have glazed donut and then
the other one the blind the haters is
actually in my drawer because I used it
the other day and I can tell you it did
not look very good on me it was it was
it's definitely intended I think for
deeper skin tones I could use it as an
eyeshadow but I don't think it looked
very good on my skin at all I really
feel like this this is really kind of
like a well I think either one of these
would work for me but I wish I hadn't
opened that now because now I can't do
it for a giveaway I'm gonna have to find
a friend to give it to and then this is
the liquid lipstick in the shade what's
the shade on this one I forget the Nicki
one Duchess Duchess which is totally my
shade at least looking at it in the tube
and they also gave me I have been
looking at this for ever ever since it
came out they gave me the pro the pro
palette so here are the highlighters
here just really really Ofra I just
I couldn't believe it let my jaw fell on
the floor when I realized what she'd
given me I was like so incredibly
thankful so thankful because she didn't
have to do that it's really nice of her
oh and a gloomy hair tie so if you're
interested in a review of the
nikkietutorials collection or of the big
highlighter palette definitely let me
know about that I'm Bonnie so I thought
you said Oprah I know how awesome would
that be of Oprah came out with a with a
makeup line that would be stinking
amazing so that's my Jen Duty haul I
think I showed you everything I'm pretty
sure and people that go into a cocktail
party got a giant pack on top of that
which is amazing so if you get the
chance to go to generation Beauty I
definitely recommend it of course
everything you get is going to be
totally different than what I got John
says I should review the Oprah okay good
to know
you know every generation beauty is
different and what attendees getting
creators yet is different like I have a
relationship with people from luck see
from a fro so that's why I got some of
the bigger things from them all right my
heart's beating let's get this over with
and talk about the Jacqueline Hill video
because man it's like when you know you
miss on something and you miss so hard
it's like like literally like if you
could hear my heart I don't know if the
microphone is picking it up my heart is
beating so fast because number one this
is live and anything I say I can't take
back but I know my heart and you know I
want to I want to tell you what's in my
heart about that so the biggest hurtful
thing that came at me from that video
was people calling me a bully like that
that was like what because let me tell
you where I started with like what the
story I told in the beginning about
wanting to help with 100% true like have
you ever known me to look in the camera
if you don't know what I'm talking about
by the way I did a video about
Jacqueline hell giving her advice on how
to review products better and it was
very much hated by a lot of people about
one out of every five people that left a
thumbs up or thumbs down left a thumbs
down and that is unheard of on my
channel so everything I said in the
beginning was a hundred percent true I
have never looked in the camera and
to you I never will look in the camera
and lie to you what happened what I
think happened was is that my tone was
off my tone was completely not
representative of what I wanted that
video to be and that was my fault and I
messed up and basically okay this is
what I kind of a correlate it with is if
you've ever like at midnight
like filled up your shopping to fill up
your online shopping cart and like made
a purchase and you wake up in the
morning and you're like why did I buy
all that you know I mean that's that
video for me where you know I woke up in
the morning and I looked at the footage
and he wanted to get a video up because
I have a schedule and usually I put up
what the K on Mondays and I was editing
it first thing in the morning I was
almost done editing it I'd edited most
of it that night while I was tired so I
was almost done and I didn't watch it
again all the way through before I put
it up I mean it was just fail after fail
after fail on my part like I just went
with it
and it was impulsive and it didn't come
off right it wasn't what I wanted it to
be it came off as very angry and very
like bitter and that is not how I was
feeling like I know I hear my voice and
I hear the way it came out I can totally
see it
like I couldn't otally see why people
interpret it that way like I get it I
totally get it and you know the people
that are coming from Jacqueline's
channel like I expected some people from
Jacqueline channel to come over and be
like you know my you're such a hanger my
man you're such a bully blah blah but I
didn't expect so many people that I love
and respect their subscribers of mine to
feel the same way and that was where I
got a really big reality check and no
there will not be any more of those
videos on my channel ever again that was
a terrible idea but but this is the
thing all right remember I was talking
about earlier about you know return on
investment return on time you know I
promise you I swear to you that I did
not sit there and think oh I'm gonna
trash Jacqueline and you know I'm gonna
get a lot of use off this and I'm gonna
get a lot of money like that was not it
but part of it I'm telling you I am a
stupidly honest person like sometimes to
a fault but I want you to know who I
really am part of it was my truth video
series has been doing really well
because I want you guys to be able to
trust me to tell you the truth about
things so that was part of the
motivation was if something seems to be
working and people seem to be enjoying
something then go with that so the truth
series is where I should have put that
content I should have taken time actual
time instead of impulsively doing
something and made a collective video
about things you know large beauty gurus
do that that I don't enjoy or I don't
like or whatever and not targeted the
specific person and I feel like I was
rushing it and I was lazy and I just
pushed it up without thinking about it
and I still should I still don't regret
giving you the information that I gave
you of things that I feel like we should
be on the lookout for from all kinds of
creators not just bigger creators but
smaller creators and smaller creators do
the exact same things you know I feel
like I'm not reading any of the comments
and I'm so sorry I haven't read any of
the comments I'm gonna scroll up and
read them in a little while but I don't
want to lose my train of thought I mean
I feel like that's important but the
format that I put it in was awful it was
an awful format it was terrible it was
stupid and I will tell you I would trade
every subscriber I got in every view I
got on that video to have been able to
come across clearly to you to have had
my message come across correctly I would
trade it all but I can't I can't go back
like once you put something on social
media it's there forever and there's no
way to go back so I can't I messed up I
admit it it was a bad video I should I'm
glad I told you that information but I
should have told you in a completely
different way and not targeting on one
person and and you know honestly like
people were saying well how would you
like it if Jacqueline made a video like
this about you
and I even responded people I would love
it and that's a big problem I think in
our society and I have that problem is
that we see perspectives from our own
perspective we see things through our
own eyes and our own experiences and I
was seeing it from my own experience I
just don't know if the super
motivational weekend at generation
Beauty we were we were all giving each
other advice we were all working
together we were all talking about how
we could make our channels better and
I'm sitting here thinking how awesome
would it be if we could critique YouTube
creators to help them to be better I
would flip and love it if someone
critiqued my channel like that and put
it out there I don't have to put out
there publicly or if they send it to me
privately I don't care I don't care I
would love it but that's my eyes that's
my perspective that is not everybody's
perspective and that is the big lesson
that I learned is that I get on you know
when people don't see things you know
from multiple perspectives when I review
things I try to look at things from
multiple perspectives and it's like you
know I always don't like it when people
don't see from other perspective and
that's exactly what I did is I didn't
see it from other people's perspective I
saw it from my own and that was my fault
because I didn't take the time I didn't
take the time to think about it and to
really process it I pushed any
reservations that I had anything in my
head that was telling me no don't upload
this I pushed it down and I ignored it
you know like if you ever had that devil
in the angel on your shoulder and you
just flip the angel like no I need to
get this video up you know that's that
it was wrong it was messed up I didn't
realize those flicking the angel at the
time you know like I realized that now
in a hindsight you know hindsight's
20/20 but I think that's what happened
now looking back at it after you know
going over this in my head
over and over and reading two days worth
of these awful comments about what a
horrible person I am and it's like I'm
really not I'm really not a horrible
person I really didn't mean to hurt
anybody I really didn't mean to offend
anybody I swear to you like and I don't
do that like I don't swear to anybody
about anything so I know I lost
subscribers off of it and it's my fault
it's my fault
I don't want people to see me as a drama
channel I don't I don't want people to
see me as a drama channel however I do
want people to know they can come to me
for the truth and there's a fine line
between a drama channel and the truth
Channel because some drama channels also
drop a lot of truth
some drama channels lie you know what I
mean I don't want to be a drama channel
I just want to give you the truth and
Mayans I had I know some people are not
gonna believe me when I say I did not
mean to start drama I promise you it had
nothing to do with drama like I just
wanted to increase like do something
different in the truth series and give
people more truth you know what I mean
like I don't know that's just the way
that I'm probably going around in
circles at this point the last thing I
wanted to mention about that before I
read some comments is that I did turn
off comments on that video and the
reason why was because I was getting
comments that were beyond horrible like
the worst thing that I said about
Jacqueline is that I wish that she
tested products more before she said how
much she loved them I also kind of
rolled my eyes a little bit about her
since she was feeling herself which was
a little bit rude now looking back at it
and rewatching it trying to see it with
different eyes but I said it wasn't my
personal taste and then I gave her a
compliment I also complimented her a
ridiculous amount how many compliments I
gave her in that video I don't know
somehow am i hater but I gave her like
nine compliments not that many but still
I complimented her a lot but anyway what
was it saying I was bragging what I was
trying to say oh I turned off commenting
because the things that people were
saying to me we're crossing a line
it was it got to the point where it
wasn't just criticism of me and that you
know you're a bully and you're a
terrible person look I was living in
that and I was like okay I deserve this
I'm gonna take it because I deserve it
but when they started going after my
kids sorry they started going after my
kids and saying that my kids were
probably bullies because I'm probably a
terrible parent and I probably taught
them to be bullies that was too far that
was too much
it was beyond you know when someone
talked about how I was probably the
worst teacher ever because they're
probably
let kids bully other kids in the
classroom you guys don't even know like
I was a freaking phenomenal teacher I
was a really good teacher and my
students loved me so do you hear people
say that really bothered me and I'm so
sorry that I'm getting so upset but it
just really bothered me so that's when I
cut off comments because it went beyond
what people what I could take and I hate
taking away your voice I hate making it
so you can't tell me your opinion I want
to hear your opinion and I deserved a
lot of what I got but when you go after
my kids I can't I can't do it anymore
so that's why I turned it off so I just
wanted to let you know that I wasn't
trying to take away your voice and your
voice is important to me I don't care
who you are your voice is important to
me but that attack I just couldn't take
it anymore so anyway I wasn't planning
on crying I'm really sorry for crying
but that was a taste of what it's like
to be a big influencer for a minute
because I know they get this kind of
stuff all the time I know they do I know
they that it's nothing this is just my
first taste at what some of those big
influencers go through every single day
and that made me feel even worse to
think that maybe Jacqueline took what I
said if she ever saw it as that bad even
though I really don't think I said
anything that terrible but I did it in
the wrong way so so anyway also the
other thing was I felt like people were
trying to one-up each other on saying
horrible things to me you know like they
were bad and then they got worse and
then they got worse and then they got
worse and then just kind of pushed it
over the edge so so anyways that's
that's why and that's what happened and
that was what I wanted to say about it
and if I upset anybody I'm really sorry
and I promise you I will never make a
video like that again it was bad
judgment is what it comes down to it was
bad judgment and I own it I did it I own
it and I messed up and I won't do it
again
so that's that's what it that's what it
comes down to and I'm gonna read some of
the comments that people are people are
saying just to just
see I appreciate all the all the the
support that people are saying Melanie
says it was not that bad you didn't drag
her I thought it was well done you know
and there are there are some mean things
that people say about influencers and I
I didn't attack her personally I was
just her review but still I mean it was
still wrong it doesn't matter it was
still wrong Jodie says I just want to
reach through the screen and hug you I
know Jodie and I bet Jodie gives the big
hugs if you don't know Jodie I'm at
yodel and Jota
like she's amazing I bet you she'd give
us amazing hugs I'm feeling it right now
you know Surratt said I'm sorry that
happened to you been watching you for
four months I really like your content
personality but the thing is I don't
take it as it happened to me it happened
because of me it happened because of
what I chose to do so you know I I
definitely don't take it as something
coming at me it's something that I
caused so I have to own it and I have to
take it and that's just you know you and
you move on you know and you just learn
from your mistakes you know and if I had
a student that was sitting here in front
of me and talking to me like this be
like alright you own it you move on from
it you can't you can't live in it
forever
and that's really why I wanted to
address it Julie says I did think about
what she said about how an Andy brand
said they didn't like your review but
they didn't mention your name and how
hurt you were it seems similar but you
call her out by name and Julie I
understand that I understand that it
wasn't honestly I prefer that I prefer
to be called out by name to be honest
with you because I I'm a big honesty
person and if someone's gonna call me
out I would have preferred to be called
by name rather than someone to go behind
my back
on an Instagram and on an Instagram
story and talk about me behind my back
I would rather someone come to my
channel or put a video out about me
telling me what they don't like that's
just me I don't like people talking
about me behind my back
so I can see your point of view Julie
though but that's how we see the world
differently and it's not wrong I'm not
right you're not right I'm not wrong
you're not wrong it's just different and
that's okay Chrissy says people are so
mean any
when the text shows are nothing but scum
of the earth I think they just wanted to
hurt me the way that I had hurt them or
the way that they thought I was hurting
Jacqueline but honestly from what I know
of Jacqueline if she watched that video
I really don't think she would be hurt
by it to be completely honest because
she seems to have grown such a thick
skin but that doesn't excuse it there's
just no excuse for it
Cassie says Jen anyone who has seen your
kids in your videos would know that your
wonderful mother and you've raised them
to be great very little human seriously
they're so sweet they are they're good
kids they really are they're really good
people they're good little people so
it's anyway I'm gonna stay on for like a
couple more minutes and then I'm gonna
spend with my spend time with my good
little people Courtney said the nasty
hurtful comments definitely crossed the
line
you can let someone know you don't
respect their actions without being
nasty and hurtful and there were a lot
of very respectful comments just like
that letting me know that they didn't
respect my actions without being nasty
and hurtful and that's why I left the
comments open for two days you know
because I felt like I owed it to people
to let them yell at me you know I mean
it was it was their right to be mad and
I didn't want to silence them so Julie
says you and your family are amazing
thank you Julie I really appreciate it
cuz I know I let you down or did I know
a lot of people down no I just feel
really bad so I messed up you know so it
is what it is but um but yeah so anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and go because I just
I'm a mess and I can't even do a wear
test anymore with this eye shadow for
today because I'm crying we're trying
not to rub the top of my eyes Kathy says
I'm sorry did you make you cry again
that's okay I just love you dearly
sweetie I appreciate that a lot
hugs to you guys too I don't mean to
make anybody cry I'm really sorry but um
but I just want to make sure that you
guys know that I'm owning my mistake I
did it it's my fault and it won't happen
again so but you can count on me to
always tell you the truth I'm just gonna
do it in a different way so the truth is
gonna stay
but just a little more thought through
so I'm gonna go ahead and pop off here
but I want to thank you guys so much for
being here and thank you for still being
here and for believing in me and for
knowing my heart and knowing that I'm
not a terrible person that I'm not a
bully that I'm not I'm not a bad person
I'm really am a good person and and that
was pretty much all that was holding me
together it was my faith in myself and
knowing that I'm a good person who just
made a mistake so I love you guys so
