think I fixed it hello my friends
welcome to a live chat our community
collective brain live chat that we do
every single week at 10:00 a.m. Eastern
Time because that's the time that I can
do it we do do a 5 o'clock p.m. chat
every once in a while for people that
can't make it to the 10:00 a.m. Eastern
chat but this is not one of those weeks
this week we're doing it at 10:00 a.m. I
get asked that question all the time if
I don't mention it so welcome to the
weekly chat I thought today what would
be fun would be to go through some of my
collection and some things that I
haven't used in a long time that I
really need to bring back to the front
of my collection because the products
are actually really really good and I
don't want them to go bad before I can
finish them some of them might already
be on the edge' bayaud because sometimes
I use things a little bit too long
because I like them and I don't want to
throw them away so I so yeah so we're
going to be going through that struggle
today I'm reorganizing my makeup
collection I have outgrown my space
which is a bad thing I am going to be
doing a spring declutter but it's not
time for that yet so we're in
reorganization mode and if I end up with
extra space after the declutter we're in
good shape I'm also in the process of
moving my set up like a weird squeaky
it's like a weird squeaking sound what
is that just making sure it's like not
one of my cats stuck or something you
know what that is definitely done sock a
cat
oh it's outside okay let's make freaking
out like is what my cat stuck let's
freak it out for a second but it's
definitely outside okay so anyway so I'm
gonna be moving this whole setup down in
my basement where there is no natural
light obviously but there's gonna be
more space so I'm gonna be putting more
artificial lighting down there and then
hopefully improve my lighting quite a
bit I'm gonna i watch desi Perkins video
on her lighting setup and it was so like
so I'm hoping because one of the big
critiques I get is that my videos don't
look as professional as some people
because of the lighting so because of
all of that this is where it circles
back to what we're doing today because
of all of that
I'm going through my collection and
reorganizing everything and I'm finding
things that I forgot about like and my
hair looks terrible right now but anyway
okay so let's go ahead and say hello to
the people that are in the collective
brain I know this drives some people
crazy but I feel that is very rude to
invite people into my home and then not
say hello so we're gonna go ahead over
and I'm going to scroll all the way up
to the top and TAM is here Banshee news
back in the house amber is here and AJ
hello good to see you and Julie and
Theresa M oh is here AJ is one of our

and forth and touch base I'm supposed to
go visit flurry this summer on a road
trip in Colorado I want to stop by and
see Florrie so but anyway all right so
let's go ahead and get into the products
that I've forgotten about and I would
love to see the collective brain chiming
in on some of these or products that
you've kind of forgotten about they
don't like holy grails that you always
forget to use from these different
categories we're just gonna start with
the bottom we're going way up to the top
so this is the Ofra silicon primer gel I
really really love this stuff
Julie I see your comment thank you so
much I appreciate you I look for a
silicon primer gel it's the weirdest
thing because it's it looks like a like
a gel and it feel it looks like it might
be silicone but silicone is actually the
very last ingredient in this it actually
just feels very wet and it doesn't feel
colors or anything like that it just
feels good and it doesn't have a set
which is really nice and I feel like it
makes my makeup last longer and I really
like it a lot over send this to me years
ago it's probably not good anymore but
it doesn't smell funky so I keep it I'm
not a very good example to follow when
it comes to throwing away products that
really should be thrown away but I
really really really like this a lot the
ranch wrenches the mods are already on
it looking back and look at he back in
good job nice job
Oh Malorie Mel is that that Mallory
Mallory going on let's see if it's
everybody saying congratulations to
Mallory but I don't know what happened
to Mallory she got home she's having a
baby
congratulations Mallory yeah that's so
exciting
yeah I know this drives some people
crazy they talk to people in the
collective brain I'm sorry I love it
there's lots of other videos on my
channel
I took every single week I get comments
every week I always don't have time I
can talking to people it's so annoying
because I like talking to people man I'm
a social person oh my gosh I go to these
um these influencer events these things
like with generation beauty and stuff
and I'm like the person walking around
being like hey and introducing myself to
people and like what's up
nice to meet you not in like an
obnoxious way but like you know just
like walking around at people that are
like look really bored and being like
what's up and like starting a
conversation like that's totally me so
talking about collective brain is very
natural for me alright Bobby says I love
that you talk to us and I know that a
lot of people really love it but I
always get complaints every single week
trying to figure out the best way to do
this with this thing I've got my coffee
on that table I've got two tables full
of stuff today here we'll just pull this
over here I have two coffee table I got
not coffee tables but like the the end
tables alright I didn't tell you what
this is this not in tables gosh we're
gonna talk about TV trays like the ones
that fold out all right this is timebomb
the foundation by the balm terrible
terrible terrible terrible shade range I
couldn't find any other foundation that
I have in my collection that has a good
shade range that I don't use I need I
really only have maybe like six
foundations I know that sounds like a
lot but for someone that reviews makeup
I don't have a whole lot of foundations
and I think maybe two of them have a
good shade range and I need to buy more
I actually went to Sephora to get the
new NARS foundation and they don't they
don't make my shade ironically enough
they don't make a shade that matches me
the one there's one that's too light and
then one that's too yellow and it
doesn't match me pretty weird right
so not complaining not complaining but I
think I might go with the one that's a
little bit too light and then put some
color changing drop Senate or something
to try to match me because the yellow
one is definitely too yellow it looks
good in the store and then when I got
outside I looked at myself and I was
like oh no I look like a banana like
this is not cute i cued it all it just
it did not look right so
I'm figuring trying to figure out a way
that I can test the NARS foundation
without compromising it too much because
it does have a great shade range they
just don't happen to make my shade which
is very very ironic isn't it isn't it
ironic don't you think
oh no Julie says my mic is blowing out a
bit okay
let me see if I can fix that I'm sorry
you see the my my it says that it's
working so I don't know why it's not
working thank you for telling me Julie
let me see if I can fix it and those of
you watching on the replay I'm going to
try to fix it
let's see settings audio it says that
it's connected let me disable it for a
second you probably can't hear me now
and let's enable it apply okay alright
how's that is that better I'm hoping
that's better thank you so much for that
okay let me go ahead oh my gosh I love
Alanis Morissette I used to have a
casual acquaintanceship with the
director Kevin Smith and he used to date
Ilana s'more set so it's just kind of
funny I always think of him whenever I
think of Alanis Morissette I've never
figured out the best way to put this
foundation on you should just dig my my
sponge in here and just go with it but I
don't know Oh Michelle says it sounds
fine
it just turned down a touch hopefully
it's good okay better now okay cool
awesome thank you okay I'm just gonna go
with the way I normally apply this which
is just going like this and digging my
sponge into this and then just rubbing
it all over my face which has worked for
me in the past and I just I you know
people get judgy and I was trying to do
it like a different way and it didn't
work now my big complain about this
foundation is number one the shade range
is awful
number two it can it's very full
coverage so it can tend to kick up a
little bit if I'm not careful around my
nose but it is a beautiful more full
coverage finish I do like to finish
overall
melissa says I love Kevin Smith funny
and bright and director yes
little-known fact I used to be back in
the baby stages of the internet I was
part of his he had like a chat thing it
wasn't even it was like I don't even
know what they called it and then he had
a message board but before that there
was like a chat thing where you could
talk to him and it was like a place for
all of his fans to get together and talk
and I was a part of that and then he
changed it into a message board and I
was a big part of that I used to go to
all the events that he would have he had
all these events so like we all made him
like a book of all of our favorite
memories and things like that and they
were probably in the start maybe about
50 of us I wasn't part of the original
group but I was like I came in like
maybe a year after the original group
started so I was still pretty early on
this looks a little bit yellow on me to
not looking in the thing but yeah I was
one of the only girls it was mostly like
geeky guys and we just had so much fun
going to these events and stuff it was a
blast it was such a good community I
still keep in touch with some of the
people that I met through that so that
was back in like 2001 I want to say
Jenny wants to know if this has good
staying power yes it does except for
that if I'm not careful it starts to
kick up around my nose and on my chin
that's my only complaint with it but
overall it does have good staying power
now for concealer I broke out the hard
candy glamoflauge light let me look at
the shade range on this because again
like complexion products I just don't
own a lot of them but I'm working on
that and I told you that I am NOT I'm
not going to purchase any new products
that are complexion products that don't
have a good shade range because if a lot
of my audience can't buy it there's no
point but at this point I don't own a
lot and I need to I need to do better on
that okay it looks like there's like one
of these available
it looks like it's discontinued oh it's
a review iwl 83 on it okay so it looks
like there's this basically doesn't
exist anymore but it was the only
concealer I have in my
for that I don't I don't use that I
should this was actually sent to me
years ago it's probably bad by my friend
Victoria she had a channel called
Victoria Donald
she doesn't upload as much as she used
to anymore but I really love this she
did so good at buying products for me
and I did so bad at buying products for
her we did a swap and she did way better
than I did her foundation I got her was
way too light I was not good but it's a
wonderful concealer and I used to use it
all the time and I forgot about it
Elaine says Marc Jacob has a new one
that has a great shade range that is
great to know I have these Sephora
they're not gift cards but they're like
the the ones when you return something
after the date you have like money that
you need to spend at the store and you
can't you can't use them online so I
have a bunch of those so I need to
invest in some new complexion products
to try Ivy says yeah I love Victoria
Dunn know that I love Victoria - she is
such a sweetheart
Rachel says weird question but why do
you put foundation on your lips a lot of
youtubers do it I just don't understand
the reason why is because I personally
feel like it creates a nice base for a
lipstick I don't know whether that's
real or not it's just in my head and
then the other reason is it's just
easier and faster to just put it on my
lips it's laziness partially let's see
pretty and camera Blaine says are you a
teacher I used to be I have my
undergraduate degree well I have a lot
of degrees so my first degree is in
mental health I have an associate's
degree in mental health and then I have
undergraduate Bachelor degrees in
special education with a certification
for general education and psychology and
then I have my master's degree in
elementary reading and literacy and well
I do that let me talk about brows and
then I have a certification to teach
home economics that I never did I got my
certification and I never used it
another product that I never never use
is the Anasazi Beverly Hills brow brow
duo I haven't used this
forever I bought this is my first
Anastasio Braille product and I never
use it
because I just have other things now so
I'm gonna use it because I don't even
remember what this looks like
it's been stuck oh okay that's really
dark why don't I use this it's so good
sorry if I just yelled in your ear I'm
really really sorry for wearing
headphones and I totally just yelled in
your ear
I apologize Michelle says I do the same
with foundation on the lips sorry caps I
need cap blocks too hot at least the CA
teachers bless you bless my friends that
are still doing it I haven't done it and
this is this is the second school year I
haven't been a teacher but bless them my
best friend still teaches and she still
tells me the the the stories of the
field and it's kind of crazy over there
alright we're gonna try something a
little different I'm gonna use the
lighter shade on the inner corner and
see what happens I'm going to use this
little little mirror instead because I'm
realizing that I'm not really liking the
way I've been doing my brows I find that
I'm making them too dark and I want to
start using a lighter shade in the inner
part because I feel like it'll look
nicer I feel like I kind of overdo it in
the front of my brows and I want to get
better at brows there we go okay that
looks pretty good not so bad on the
other brow product I wanted to show you
that I kind of like and kind of don't
this is the Maybelline brow drama crayon
pomade
this is too big so it's very hard to get
where you want it to go but I remember
really liking it though the formula of
it so what I was doing was I was taking
a brow brush and dipping it in and using
it like a like a pop pomade instead of a
stick but I remember liking this but I
wasn't going to use it today but I
figured I'd show it to you anyway since
I had it Jenny says that's a good
strategy Thank You Jenny pretty and the
person that asked me about the teacher
she says thank you it's so hard but I do
for myself my children yeah and I like I
have a whole video about why I stopped
teaching and if you're curious about all
of that I definitely recommend you watch
that because I feel like it's um you
know it was straight from my heart of
of you know what it's like to be a
teacher and why I just had to get out of
it because it was driving me insane
alright so now I've got my base on let's
go ahead and let's do let's mm-hmm okay
let's do eyes next
so we'll do where's my eyeshadow primer
okay this is one that I've heard a lot
of complaints about recently but I've
only ever had good experiences with it
this is the step one eye primer by
Coastal Scents and I've really enjoyed
this it's got a lot of the same
ingredients as the Urban Decay primer
potion but it's um it is different but
it's got some similar ingredients to
that and I do like it I'm gonna go ahead
and put that on but some people are
saying in the comments I heard a couple
people talking about how it's too oily
for their oily lids and it makes their
their eyeshadows crease really bad and
now that I'm like thinking about it like
that I can feel that it is a little bit
oily but I've had nothing but good
experiences with this product but I
don't have Whaley lids so that might be
why I have good experiences with it Amy
says she loves the Elfman NYX brow
pencils oh by the way another thing I
wanted to mention is that someone was
very upset that I was ignoring their
comments in the live chat there are very
few people on this planet that I ignore
and I think the only person that might
come to chat that I would ignore it
would know why I'm ignoring her because
this is a long-running thing but there's
like one person that I would ignore so
if you I'm ignoring if you think I'm
ignoring you I promise you I'm not
unless you're that person that already
knows I'm going to ignore her because
I've told her multiple times I'm going
to ignore her or maybe there's two
there's me and GG two I would ignore me
and GG who now has a new name but other
than that two people if you're not mean
GG or that other person that's been
around for years and years and years
you're good I'm not ignoring you
it's just I can't read everything I'm
getting ready I'm doing all these things
and it's really hard to read everything
so please don't take it personally if I
don't read what you're saying
Gayle says you can't possibly address
all these comments and that's the truth
that's the truth but I feel I feel bad
because I don't want to make anybody
feel bad or like they're not important
or I don't think that they're important
so I wanted to address that
okay I shadow I have a lot of eye shadow
I wanted to show you the first thing I
want to show you I'm not actually gonna
use today but I want to show you because
I think they're so stinking cool
I've had these oh my gosh I was a
collecting these because they were like
twenty dollars apiece or something when
they first came out these were the Stila
countless color pigments and if you've
been around my channel for a while you
know my obsession with these there's
more because what before they went on
before they went out they went on deep
sale and I got a bunch of them at
Nordstrom Rack I believe for like
between $5 and $1 each like eventually
they ended up being $1 I think I've all
of them except for one that I actually
had owned and then I returned it was
like one that was like kind of brown
colored but man these things were so fun
so you got stuff like this and then you
can swipe on this side and then you can
swipe on this side and then it ends up
like that but now it's like that's
really not very pigmented is a girl that
is not very thing that I'm talking to
myself right now
alright and then let's try let's try
this one this one's like a purpley one
and you can go on the two different
sides the big issue with these is that
it's hard to get the same look on both
eyes because of their marbling if you
look at the inside of it
see how it's like marbled especially the
ones with multiple different colors like
this one this one I have a lot of fun
with this I remember getting I think
this was the original one that I got for
$20 but they've got this cool marbling
but then the problem is is getting
getting the same spot for both eyes but
these things are so fun I thought they
were so pretty and I ended up getting so
many of them but I never use them I
don't know why maybe because they don't
work that well in other ones that I
don't use often enough but they're
amazing they're so good these are the
Pat McGrath single shadows that came
with some of their kits I have what is
this this is copper 0-5 and then this is
astral white these things are so good
they're so good alright this one watch
this watch
oh my god this is more like a topper but
it's so pretty so pretty like I'm not a
big topper person but oh my goodness
so birdie ceilings really been dropping
the ball on an eyeshadow game I wish
that they would come back out with some
good eye shadows they're missing they
have like the liquid once but one time I
like the pressed ones they don't come
out with a good pressed eyeshadow
palette in a while so anyway let's go
ahead oh and then a couple other
eyeshadow palettes that have it used in
a while this right here I haven't used
in forever the Kat Von D The Alchemist
holographic palette holographic this I
haven't used in a while and this is such
a good tool this is such a good tool
because if you like this kind of thing
because you can pass this over lipsticks
you can pat it over an eyeshadow and
look and give it a completely different
look it's just so fun and then this I
use like twice the Dirty Dancing count
from solo look oh my gosh I use it like
once or twice haven't used it since I
don't know why because it works great I
think it's because the color selection
is just so odd and random and it's like
where do I even go with this but I could
still use it you know as individuals but
isn't this the cutest little packaging
ever it looks like a VHS tape and it's
just so cute and this was in
collaboration with Dirty Dancing it's
not like a we're gonna pretend and hope
Dirty Dancing doesn't notice like it's
in collaboration with Lionsgate so oh
and then one more eyeshadow palette
we're gonna play with some of these this
is the NYX perfect filter eyeshadow
palette these are really good I don't
know why I don't use it these things are
really good I have this one and then I
have one other one I don't know why I
don't use them because they're awesome
Jody says way too much too wasted space
for me exactly I feel the same way about
it absolutely all right so let's figure
out what we're gonna do I'm wearing this
like maybe we'll focus on this palette
let's do that let's focus on this
palette and again I'm not a makeup
artist I'm not claiming to be American
artist do I have to stand every single
time alright so let's start with this
guy right here and we're gonna go up in
the cream
so with this really fluffy brush and see
what happens
hi Kelsey good morning to hot mess mama
MD hope that you are well try to get a
little closer these some of these NYX
pounce it's so funny because some of the
NYX pallets are like really really
really bad and some of them are really
really good and they're starting to up
their prices a little bit so I'm hoping
they can keep up with the quality with
the upped prices they're really smart on
their on their social influencer
networking like I've noticed that I
think they're putting in more
influencers in their marketing which is
really smart so I'm hoping they keep up
with the quality along with that all
right I'm gonna go in with this guy I
don't think I've ever used this one this
like Jean shade right here Elise says I
see you I see you brands that don't do
their due diligence and getting rights
what Oh brands that don't do their due
diligence and getting rights to produce
products yeah absolutely there are a lot
of them all right so we're to use that
like Jean color one thing I realize
about my makeup and my skill is that I
do best if I have like an in SPO picture
if I'm just going off the cuff it's a
lot harder for me to create something
that's different like I have no
creativity none because I started using
the crayon case eyeshadow palette and
when I had an in spot to go off of I
feel like it came out really really good
but just trying to play with that thing
by myself oh my gosh forget it it was
not happening all right let's go ahead
and let's put do my signature what I
always do a light lid and I'm gonna go
with this one with my fingertip and see
how it goes it looks kind of dark so
we're gonna start on the outside and
work the way in I am going after this to
birthday party my family's actually
already there my son's best friend his
mom is awesome and I'm going to go see
them as soon as we're done here let's
see look how pretty that is
okay and then we're gonna use the
lighter shade I don't put some stuff
down you know I got two hands put this
one on the inner corner oh man I just
realized I'm missing all these comments
Erica says I want the box of crayons
palette yeah why I saw Laura did a video
on it Laura Lee did a video on it so I
would imagine now that she's talked
about it it's gonna be very highly
coveted all right that looks super
pretty this is like a duochrome I forgot
about that
it's been that long since I've used it
it's like a gray and pink I don't know
if you can see the little shift there
it's so pretty
Louie wants to know if I've tried the
new glosses from dose of colors I have
not I have not I'm digging this I look
though except for the fallout on my face
that wiped off really easily though and
a little bit of dry around my nose I
think my skin type is changing a little
bit too dry hmm
I like my normal skin no normal skin is
so much easier Michelle says the back of
cranes sold out yeah I would imagine it
won't come back for a little while
because I'm sure that they're gonna want
to produce a lot of them the palette
that I'm using Jenny is the the perfect
filter eyeshadow palette by NYX and this
one is in the shade gloomy days which
matches today okay I think we're gonna
do a little bit of brow bone let's see
oh you know what we should do let's put
let's for fun put this Pat McGrath guy
over top that's like a topper to make it
a little less gloomy there we go we went
from gloomy to gorgeous I love using my
finger tip number one they're a lot
easier to wash them brushes and number
two I feel like I have like more control
over my fingers than I do a brush I
guess that's just my lack of proper
experience with a brush well I don't
know if I have a lack of experience but
don't have makeup artist experience but
that is so fun can you see that
hopefully my camera quality is good
enough that you can see that but that is
so fine I really like it okay let's just
blend a little bit out on the brow bone
a little bit that is a fun look okay
we'll do a little bit of liner this is
one that I've forgotten about a lot this
is the man eat cotton about a lot like
you could forget about something more
than a lot I've mean completely
man-eater tart in the tart man-eater
mascara I haven't used this in a while
it was in my eye liner little spinny
thing that I'll show you in a minute
I never reach for it and it's so good
its heart makes actually makes really
really good eyeliners dawn says Zhu vias
place rules Judy's place is pretty
awesome as far as the quality let me see
I'm not gonna do a wing today because I
can't do it one-handed oh no is it dried
out Oh wah wah wah told you I'd use it
in a while it's not completely dried out
but it's not good oh that makes me sad
Amy says I love taiked arts micro liner
it is really good alright I'm gonna
shoot for the trash can honest okay I'll
get it after the chat mat okay so what
we're gonna have to do because I didn't
bring let's see do I have any other
liquid liners over here that I could use
well my brushes are falling okay this
one I don't use often this one was sent
to me by a friend this is the shot to
Chi eyeliner and it is super fab it the
only my only complaint about the chantek
i want is that the point is too stiff so
it's hard to get it to give the good
Bend as it like goes on the lid but it
works it works by the way just in case
to clarify I do not ask anybody to send
me anything if somebody sends me
something it's because of their own free
will because they chose to and I am darn
right going to tell them thank you for
sending me something if I show something
on camera
so there hey that's gonna hey hey hey
hey um but yeah I don't ask people to
send me things just so you know I have
never been somebody to ask people for
things that's why super chat was such a
bomb for me because I always it always
felt awkward that's why I'm not doing it
anymore like I remember asking on my mom
I was so when I was in college I asked
my mom for like 200 bucks or something
because I was literally like I was out
of money and I needed to pay my rent and
I cried to her I said I'm so sorry mom I
hate to even ask you for this I'm so so
so sorry and I was crying and she was
like don't worry about it was one time I
asked my mom for money and I felt so
horrible and I paid her back as soon as
I possibly could she didn't want to take
it back but I made her take it so I'm
not like one to ask for things so if
someone sends me something it was their
own free will
and I did not ask for it
Gwen wants to know could you do a
monochromatic look probably we should do
that in a live chat coming up soon we
should do a monochromatic look they're
fun I like monochromatic they're easy
for me like compared to not
monochromatic because you know all I do
is I do light and then I just build into
the crease like make the creek like the
like big like the lightest on the lid
and then like a medium like bigger and
then build in deeper into the crease Don
says I finally got the ordinary
foundation now here there's drama about
it via Stephanie Nicole's insta pose I'm
gonna have to see what Stephanie has to
say about all that cuz I'm pretty sure
she knows the people over at dusty um we
did not cover it this week because I
didn't feel like we had enough of the
story and it seems like there's a lot of
emotion going on with the owner and I
don't know I just felt irresponsible to
cover it right now it doesn't mean we're
not gonna cover it in the future but
because it all just dropped it just kind
of felt irresponsible to maybe not give
the full story on this particular story
so we decided not to cover it but it's
not because it's not important it's just
we want to make sure we have the whole
thing like for example
well they said oh wait before we before
I get into all that the L'Oreal
voluminous mascara this is about to die
I have very few mascaras open at a time
but this one is about to run out
I used the do two out of it when I first
opened it it is a fantastic mascara but
then I started moving on to some other
mascaras and haven't used it recently
but but yeah so I mean he basically is
they like he said something to a woman
that asked if he was okay asked you know
something about you know that they
should use his next product or whatever
but it was unclear what that product did
some there was an article about that the
product is supposed to bleach your skin
but then some people were saying that it
doesn't bleach your skin that it's you
know for something else and all that and
I just felt like we didn't have the full
story so I'm definitely gonna have to
I'm definitely gonna have to get make
sure I have that whole story before we
cover it and what's up and makeup if we
do so alright L'Oreal voluminous super
super good mascara like honestly I feel
like this performs like a high-end
mascara like it doesn't clump it just
makes my lashes look naturally more full
and longer and prettier I mean it's not
a super dramatic mascara but it um it's
not super dramatic but it does what it's
supposed to do I'm just gonna build this
up with two coats and see if I can show
you and it looks so natural it's so
stinkin pretty alright let me show you
see if you can see the difference
between my two eyes Kelsey made it yay
alright let me close my eyes I can't see
anything can you see the difference
because there's a 30-second delay on
what I can see them you can see
hopefully you can see the difference I
hope Elyse says I used to love the
butterfly effect one oh yeah you can
totally see the differ
it's just so nice that it doesn't clump
but yet does such wonderful things as
far as length not quite as much volume
but it's like a natural volume instead
of like a clumpy I have one giant lash
volume you know it's just a really
pretty mascara and I would definitely
purchase this over most high-end
mascaras I am really really hoping that
within very very soon that these
drugstore American brands you know
L'Oreal Paris is Paris I'm pretty sure
L'Oreal is an American brand employ like
wait a second it says L'Oreal Paris but
I'm pretty sure they're American but
anyway I'm really hoping that they are
going cruelty-free at some point I don't
think it's a priority in China to change
that law but I'm really hoping because
it's crazy that there is even any of
that know at this point with all the
technology we have all right so mascara
is done how we doing how we doing
looking good and he says the voluminous
carbon black is good as a good one
I just used mine up I bought the total
temptation Ortiz I don't know the names
I just bounce around with my CVS 30% off
coupon yeah hey that's smart you say Mia
says Jen are you going to try magnetic
lashes I actually did I tried magnetic
lashes in my fabfitfun video it actually
ended up getting a decent amount of use
for a fabfitfun video is actually kind
of happy with the number of usually owes
and yet don't get a whole lot of views
because they really really over
advertised people are like I don't even
need to see if a bit fun but if you want
to see me try magnetic lashes there's
skip ahead buttons in the fabfitfun
video you can skip ahead right to where
I'm trying magnetic lashes they actually
look pretty decent until you zoom in
close and then they look terrible
if they didn't realize how bad they
looked I just didn't I had no idea how
bad they looked it like up close but
from far away you can really see it okay
so for
because we're done with the io8 I wanted
to do my lower lashline real quick
we'll use an eyeliner okay so this
eyeliner this is oh wait let's not do
that one cuz that one kind of stinks
let's do a good one cuz I said this was
we're gonna do all good products here
okay alright here we go here we go julep
okay julep makes really good eye liners
this is their gel eye glider I don't
find that this transfers low down on my
lid you know when you put I like cream
like or pencil eyeliners on and then the
next thing you know you look like a
raccoon these do not do that for me
this one is in the shade smokey taupe
smokey taupe shimmer let's put that on
the lower lash line but I'd like never
use pencil eyeliners ever but I do like
them and I usually tend to not go all
the way across because I feel like it
looks too harsh on me so I just go
halfway and I feel like that looks
really pretty that's just mean that's my
thoughts I like the way that it looks
ooh a mr. Ashe tone says I'm in love
with the navy blue liquid eyeliner from
Too Faced nice you know what I didn't
get the navy blue one I got where's my -
oh I did get the navy blue oh no that's
laura geller the laura geller one's
really nice oh I take it the navy blue
one from Too Faced have I been using it
no I found needs to be kind of watery
like see that that was one swipe Oh
Annie is here
she said she watches she said you had
better look applying them to other
youtubers yeah when I build it up it
looks nice but I found these to be
really watery these two faced pen liners
I bought a couple of them I got this one
and then I for some odd reason I got the
peach one I don't know I guess I'll stay
on the page oh but I thought they were
so cute that they look like little pens
so I got a couple of them but oh and
then I got oh I got more I forgot I got
more I got these but I do think of the
blue one is probably the best one cuz
it's darker but I don't know why I got
these light colors I don't know what I
was thinking I actually really liked
better I like the UM the laura geller
ones are really good I would definitely
choose these over the Too Faced they're
just more opaque you know okay so let's
do now that I've done lower lashline
let's
you blush so a couple blushes that I
haven't been using this is the NARS and
I used to use this one a lot this is the
dual intensely intensity blush in fervor
and I actually had two of these I ended
up returning one of them because they
were so stinkin expensive and I just I
wasn't using it but this one's really
really pretty and then also another one
that I was obsessed the Yves pearl blush
trio and they make these for different
skin tones so the idea behind the Yves
pearl range is that they have light
medium and deep for all of their color
products show that you go with whatever
your skin tone is I guess they could
probably have very like light warm light
cool medium warm medium cool you know or
something like that or you know meet
warm cool neutral something like that
but I like that they try to cater to
different skin tones which I thought
think is great
but I was using this so much when I
first got it and haven't used it much
lately I think I'm gonna dip into the
NARS because I'm feeling this color
right here I think that would be fun
the only person Susan says I feel like
the only person that in this community
that doesn't own a NARS blush got to get
on that they're probably not that great
to be honest with you alright this is an
elf blush brush and we're just gonna pop
into that shimmery shade oh that's so
pretty I don't use this in forever why
don't I use as it's so pretty and it's
not even that shimmery you know I
thought I remembered it being shimmery
or I like NARS blushes because they
build you can start off with light and
then build them up they don't go there
they're easy to work with but I don't
think that they're anything magical that
they're worth a price point I think the
price point is outrageous
they are good though I will say they are
good okay I think that looks so pretty
I don't know if you can see it in the UM
in the camera because you know my lights
blow it out and everything but in person
it looks good and I'm going to a
birthday party so I'm not trying to over
to it alright let's go into contour
contour products are over here okay
oh I only brought out one contour
product this is the makeup revolution
ultra contour pro palette and I actually
really really like this one a lot I
think they make this in multiple skin
tones if I remember correctly and this
one is at least I hope they do because
this one's pretty light I definitely
would hope that makeup revolution would
have a darker one then that's because
the dark is not very dark this is the
shade that I use in here the most the
highlights in here are actually quite
nice as well you switch brushes and
let's go into actually kind of like this
one believe it or not for contour
because of the bulbous nosov it this is
from the Jasmin collection by Luxy and I
really like this one but makeup
revolution makes really good contour and
bronzing products I feel like they do
really well with the tones of them or I
feel like a lot of brands they always go
warm it's like why why are you so warm
what are you doing I mean a lot of
people do do the warm but I feel like
you know we should be doing more than
just warm we should be doing warm and
cool and neutral you know
Ola Milani Luminoso just says yes I need
to own that I've never owned it and I
need to own it
alright so that's it for that and then
the highlight that I wanted to show you
that I neglect all the time actually
there's two of them but when we're gonna
use this is the Ofra blush stripes I was
obsessed with these I know that word
obsessed but I was so I'm I was all
about these for forever and I just
haven't reached for it recently and it's
very very very nice then the honest Asya
glow kit this was another thing I used
all the time all the time and I haven't
used it in forever this one is in gleam
I don't think they sell this one anymore
but anasazi really makes beautiful
beautiful highlighters so we're gonna go
ahead let's do let's do mimosa this one
right here well I've got a weird little
random hair sticking out here okay ohana
says the amor anna says the blush on the
butter blush
the physician's formula butter blush oh
that's a little dark I don't remember
that being so dark it's okay well blend
it out in the eye you know the butter
blush I got the very first shade that
came out and it didn't show up on me and
I didn't like it at all but I know
they've come out with multiple shades
since then I haven't purchased anymore
so I can't I can only speak to the one
that I tried and I honestly didn't like
it and it wasn't the formula it was the
shade they chose was just really way too
light
oh god headsets contours make me look
like a dad look make me look at Davros
oh no well not everybody needs a contour
I think that sometimes YouTube you know
makes people feel like you God do every
single step but not everybody needs
every step look I feel like bronzing
looks kind of crazy on me maybe it's
just my skill level and contouring my
nose it's never gonna happen never gonna
contour my nose it looks terrible I was
even told at Sephora at a contouring
class that I should never contour my
nose because it looks crazy I don't have
a nose that contour as well and he says
I'd love to try deeper color in the
butter blush if they make it I think
they do now Sarah Anne says I'm trying
to get used to my channel my Chanel
cream bronzer so expensive better
believe I'll figure out how to make it
work for that price mm-hmm mom totally
with you definitely faces is I had the
same trouble with the butter blush I'm
super pale and I didn't show up yeah
exactly
exactly I don't even know who they made
that for I guess people that are super
super fair but that's such a limited
number of people you think they come out
with enough shades you know we know that
they've always stuck to lighter shades
you know but that I thought was kind of
was really ridiculous Kelsey says at the
classes at Sephora good mine was really
good I've only gone to the one and I
really loved it I thought it was
fantastic I had so much fun and they do
I mean they're the people that run it
our makeup artist like they're like I
pretty sure you have to be a certified
makeup artist in order to run the class
Aspen says my nose is long and skinny
contouring it would make me look like I
have a pixie stick in the middle of my
face all right let's go ahead and do a
little bit of setting powder before we
do lips this is the Besame translucent
brightening vanilla powder I really love
this this smells so good it smells like
vanilla I remember getting ready for
work when I was teaching and loving
getting ready for work with this because
it's such a beautiful smell you know to
wake up and smell that I'm gonna use a
fluffier brush I think for this because
I don't want to completely modify my
face I want to like just have a light
dusting of setting powder but I really
really love this oh and the other thing
I'm not doing that a lot of people do is
highlighting right here and right here I
already have like kind of prominence
here so I really don't want to bring it
forward anymore
I don't think that's a good idea for me
you know I mean I feel I think that we
have to decide as individuals which
one's which one of these things are
right for us and just because our
favorite person on YouTube does
something doesn't mean that it's going
to look good on us so you have to really
go with your gut and what you think
looks good not because of peer pressure
from these beautiful insanely talented
Beauty people the setting powder City of
the silent is by Besame and is the
brightening vanilla powder and it smells
like vanilla it smells really nice it's
got this little powder puff inside and
it works really really well but because
I don't want to like super mattify my
face I'm using a fluffier brush instead
just to kind of give it a light dusting
of setting without like packing down and
making it more matte you can have a
choice of that there Oh Chris Anna
Anna's here from Chris Anna and
cosmetics she says setting powder always
makes me look super dry and cakey after
like 30 minutes have you tried just
lightly fluffing it around instead of
packing it on cuz I find that that makes
a big difference for me I don't know
alright last up we have lips okay and
then we'll just sit around and chat for
a bit for lips I feel like I've been
neglecting my Too Faced that look creme
lipsticks I love my two-faced look
around lipsticks they are so comfortable
I have a few different formulas that I
wanted to show you this one let me see
if I can read these I know they're
different formulas but I don't know if
it says it on them I know this one is
like the balm one it's like a lip balm
and this one is in the shade honey bunny
and then these are the the
the the gold ones are the traditional la
crÃ©me so this one is sugar daddy and
then this one is naughty nude this one's
really nude and then this one is when in
doubt which i think is also I just got
all nudes I did that but yeah I just
love this formula it's super super
creamy I also wanted to show you another
thing that I neglect on my colour-pop
lippie stix which I love the lippy 6
formula I hate saying lippie stix but I
love the formula I heard I don't know if
this is true okay
allegedly I heard that the lippie stix
formula and their new lipstick formula
are the same is that true I haven't
looked but I'd be curious to know if
it's true so I have a ton of these these
are just the nude shades I organized my
lipsticks if you follow me on Twitter I
put up a picture of my organized
lipstick so these are just the nude
shade so I just went into my little
nudie drawer over there so I've got like
some medium nudes and deep need some
light nudes nudie nudes some pinky nudes
which aren't really nudes if you think
about it because you know people only
get so pink but you know but yeah I hate
the word lippy to Stacey I hate it but
they're really really good formula
they're very creamy so I think I'm going
to dig into these right here because I
have some deeper shades here let's do a
capisce
I like capisce it's kind of a brownish
and if it stinks we'll take it off and
we'll do another one this is always like
when I get ready on periscope this is
always the part I get stuck out is the
lips every time ooh that's pretty
anchor gonna be good it just goes on so
opaque and it's so creamy and
comfortable
I very much prefer this formula over the
liquid lipsticks because the liquid
lipsticks are too drying for me but I
really really like it so yeah so this is
the shake capiche I don't know if they
still sell it or not cuz I didn't check
but I really liked the shade and I think
it looks pretty
we've got like the cool eye and a little
bit warmer on the lips it's fun it's a
fun look I'm still over done for a
birthday party aren't I oh I wanted to
show you something I am going to make a
video on this let me go get it but we'll
play with it for a second just to show
you this is not a forgotten product it's
a new product this right here let's play
with this this is the new Kat Von D
white lipstick I want to do a whole
video showing you oh look see I've used
it it's disgusting looking hold on a
second what the what the idea behind
this is is that it's supposed to change
your lipstick shade to a lighter shade
and my biggest complaint right now is
that it gets disgusting because when you
use it to lighten up a lipstick the
lipstick stays on it the one you used so
that's just cleaned up as it's gonna get
but I'm excited about showing you how
this works because I've been really
enjoying it so we'll just put on half so
you can see the difference see the
difference isn't that pretty
I really like that I think it's fun and
it makes it so you kind of double your
lipstick collection and not that this is
anything transformative or anything that
hasn't ever been done before but I like
that she's trying to do something
different you know and I like that I
like the color it's pretty it's fun so I
think that doing like a whole video and
showing you how it transforms different
products I think would be fun
I might film that next week so Mary Ann
says I use a lip brush with a white
lipstick keeps it from getting gross
that is very smart I'm too lazy to use a
lip brush that's that the only reason
why I don't use one I'm actually very
when it comes to that TLC says oh wow
buying the Kat Von D today I thought it
was literally a white lipstick it is
literally a white lip lipstick like if
you put it on let me kind of see I got
that's the color from that I just put on
but let me see if I can clean some of
that off here but it is a white lipstick
I mean it still has some of the color
there but I mean that's that's what it
is I see you see that but it's really
fun you know it's kind of like the you
know how she had the transformative the
holographic this thing you know just for
fun let's put a little bit of this on
because we've still got eight minutes
let's put a little bit of this on
because it's fun let's put a little bit
of this pinky gold one since we're in
this Kat Von D moment here sure why not
we're on to a birthday party oh it
disappeared darn okay there we go
I'm fine and then who's Monica says easy
ombre exactly it's fun hey super fun the
Kat Von D lipstick it's the from the new
line of lipstick it's called white out
from the studded kiss creme lipsticks so
yeah I think it was like 20 bucks
something like that well yeah it's fun
Steph says look at you experimenting
stuff is always proud of me when I do
something new I love you stuff staff is
Steph's been around for forever so I am
done getting ready this is my whole
makeup look I hope that you like it I
like it I think it came out good it's a
it's a nice fun fun look for me with the
greys and everything I've worn this much
grey on my eyes in a while but I really
like it I like the way that it came out
so let's just have a little chat we got
about six minutes left so what do you
guys want to talk about let's talk about
just whatever thought that says tries
you a skinny dip I got you a skinny dip
I got it in my in my beauty lush lucky
bag and May
my whole lucky bag worth the lucky bag I
think because it put it into my life
even though it's 30% off right now if
you want to try let me let me get it out
because then that way you can see how
like what it's like to decide whether
you want it because it's 30% off right
now all right it's right here oh I got
it
microphone only reaches so far this is
the shoe a skinny dip pellet and oh my
gosh I haven't used it as much as I
should you definitely want to use a
glitter glue with it and I'm running out
of space here let's just put it here see
like that one is weak the pink one is
weak it's like a topper that one's not
so great either but the shape that I've
used on my eyes I really liked okay I
will put them all up to the camera
hopefully so you can see hopefully
you'll be able to see but yeah so this
one right here is more of a topper but
the rest are really really nice you just
kind of put this up here so you can see
but yeah for 30% off if you like this
kind of thing I want to check that out
Jenny says Oh Jen did you see Kristin
game's message to you she wants you to
try the orb orb a dry texture spray
where did she put that how do I miss
that off the texture later and see wait
a minute somebody told me you're trying
to talk to me about the orb a dry
texture spray I'm scared of that stuff
man
scared of it
Steph says I love bikini but I have
trouble with it that's the pink one yeah
definitely but yeah I mean it's super
sparkly and fun and I've only used it I
think twice both times I really liked it
but I think I was mostly sticking to
like these three here where these look a
little more subdued and this one's more
of a topper Elise says did you figure
out your benefit browsing Zoar toss it
ah I lost it I lost it I have my benefit
next video coming out is my benefit
review of products I did figure it out a
little bit better and then I lost it I
don't know what happened to it Jenny
says I think it was a game
with me okay I'm an alt text I'll text
Kristen seeing because I do have her
phone number
Kelsey says the orb a dry texture spray
is Holy Grail seriously the best I think
I she need to figure out how to use it
Bristol says Jen any thoughts on the new
to face festival collection girl I'm so
over unicorns I'm over it man I mean I
can see why they wanted to do it because
they if you remember two days came out
with unicorn tears and then tart came
out with the unicorn stuff and then they
had that whole there's no unicorns in
the Amazon thing shade that Too Faced
Michelle throwing at chart and I guess
that's when they decided to do the
unicorn collection but now it's a year
later and tarts already done it and
everybody else has already done it and
I'm done it it's over I'm done with the
unicorns I just don't I'm not feeling it
like last year was all the pastels and
everything and I'm like looking for
something different and like everybody
keeps talking why aren't people doing
dragons dragons are so cool I'm totally
with that they should have totally done
dragons that would have been epic like
you imagine like a fireball red with
like some like like orange sparkle in it
or something you know what I mean like
something cool like with like like red
with orange and yellow like sparkles in
it it could have been amazing like just
that like looked like fire you know or
like blue with like some purple in it
amazing Paige says do you think it's
worth buying the skinny dip palette if
you already own golds and Silver's or is
it just a good choice if you need those
shades if you already own metallic golds
and bronzes I would say don't bother
because really the best shades of this
metallic silver this metallic gold and
this metallic bronze the rest are just
kind of math but if you don't have
shades like this they're really really
good
they Stacey said no mermaids either when
Julie says mermaids and unicorns need to
disappear yes I'm with you I'm so with
you mr. Ashton says there are already
two reviews on the palette on the
two-face site and they're negative slams
and the palette is not even out yet oh
no man we see this is what I worry about
because now it's like becoming trendy to
slam products just for the sake of
slamming them and it's like I think it
started off with Alissa Ashley's
subculture which was like from her heart
and exactly the way she felt and genuine
and awesome and amazing but people saw
like she blew
after that subculture video like blew up
and I think some people want to emulate
that and I worry like I don't know if
it's real or not but I were either the
people that are trying to copy Elissa
and what happened with Elissa will say
something's bad even though it's not bad
in order to get views and that's just
not cool at all like if something's bad
like legit bad you got to say it's legit
bad like elicited with her personal
experience but you can't just say
something's bad just because you want
views because that's just messed up you
know I really feel like you know it's
really hard to find YouTube reviewers
that actually genuinely want to give you
honest information with no ulterior
motive that's just that's my my opinion
there's definitely a lot of them out
there and that's why I tend to stick to
smaller channels when it comes to
reviews because I feel like I can
identify more there and then watch
bigger channels for like tutorials and
entertainment and stuff like that that's
just me personally Kathryn says have you
used any of the natasha denote of
palates do you like them I do like the
Natasha - no - palates I do feel like
they are not as amazing as they're not
like I don't think they're worth the
price let's just say that with Natasha -
no no I do really really like them a lot
especially like they're they're more
foil and formula they have a bunch of
different formulas in there I think they
can definitely Rock a matte formula
they're matte formula is awesome but I
definitely don't think that they're
worth the price at all Michelle says
Emily Noel Emily Noel 83 is legit a
hundred percent agree there she's one I
feel like I can always trust and she's
inching up on a million subscribers I'm
so excited for her Stephanie says hey
Jan hi Monica wants to Bennet oxygen in
a blush palette yeah I didn't get that
I'm not sure if that's something I would
want to get or not Angie says yes me too
I like smaller channels they're more
real and relatable like I've been
watching a lot of them really addicted
right now like channels that I'm in
loving or like Georgia Harris and makeup
struggles and who else have been
watching a lot lately
hot mess mama MD and all the
smaller channels that I shouted out in
that video was that Lauren may beauty
live loves her makeup
you know channels like that that are
like around like the 50,000 subscriber
and less you know like I feel like we're
we're in a good place there but then
there's like people like Emily who I
love Emily is a Brina
Sabrina's another one that's a bigger
channel rob Beauty Christie is another
one's a really good channel for reviews
so where there are bigger channels that
I definitely watch and find valuable
it's not all of the bigger channels but
I'm finding that like there's definitely
some bigger channels that I don't trust
at all I just done subscribed but I
don't want to call anybody Alex I think
that's mean oh my goodness it's 101 oh
my gosh Sabrina is amazing I'm so glad
that she's back she just went through
this huge ordeal with her family I'm so
glad everything is better and bad she's
back and everything Sabrina is fabulous
she's gorgeous and beautiful melissa
Autry hasn't been putting out videos
lately she's been going through some
stuff so I'm hoping that that all of
that will calm down for her and she'll
be able to come back to YouTube because
she was the dupe queen melissa Autry was
so good at the duping it was like the
best dupe videos she was so good and
she's just been going through a lot
lately so I'm hoping she'll be able to
things will be better Oh Angelica
nyquist yes very good and yqv ist is
Angelica's last name another great very
very honest Channel totally agree Angie
wants to know thoughts on the a BH soft
glam I don't know if I'm gonna get that
one just because there's a lot of
repeats from other palates I've heard
and like singles and stuff and I don't
know I think I might skip that one
alright I got to pop off here I'm gonna
go meet my kids
and my husband at the birthday party but
I miss Melissa - I do miss Melissa yeah
Melissa and I like we we had kind of a
weird start to our friendship and then
the more we got to know each other like

social media checking on each other and
everything she's she's been good to me

collabs in the past and stuff she's been
very good say oh it's Samantha March how
