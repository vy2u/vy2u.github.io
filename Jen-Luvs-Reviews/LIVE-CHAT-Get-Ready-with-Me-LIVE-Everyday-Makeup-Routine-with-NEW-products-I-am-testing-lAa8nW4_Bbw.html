guess I haven't spoken my couple of
minutes mom what's got a little froggy
and we're fading in and out that's okay
we're gonna make it so today we are
going to be getting ready with me trying
some new products this is what I do at
five morning's a week typically on
periscope that you're not follow me on
periscope periscope it with the new hot
it apps it's kind of extension of
snapchat in the it's like it's live
stream it's just like what we're doing
here so if you're not following on
periscope deadly follow me on periscope
if you like this format so I'm drinking
out of my parallels mugs today because
as soon as you join me on periscope you
become a pair of love and as soon as you
tap the screen one time you give me a
heart you become a pair of love hashtag
tied to my Carrie loves out there is
that anyway so today we're gonna be
trying out some products that I have not
tried yet some products that I wanted to
try that I'm excited to try there's also
some things that I've already tried in
here because I don't have new of every
single type of makeup product but I
thought we could get ready together and
kind of make some choices together kind
of like I do on periscope so let's go
ahead and get started with that and if
you're joining the e on life and being
here and I am going to take just a
minute to say hello to the people that
are here also known as the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness hanging out
over there in the lab Chad you are also
part of the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness and that down in the
comments below anything you'd like to
contribute is part of the collective
brain we can all learn from each other
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go ahead you go to the top of the chat
and just say hello to the first people
that were here hello to fizzy pop and
seven Reese and Nikki and Monica and
Krista and Krista my monthly obsessions
calm and Steph is here and Julie and um
Krista says she misses my take me to the
edge of back song I was so tired of that
song oh my gosh I know you guys probably
some of you probably weren't tired of it
but
I've listened to that thing hundreds and
hundreds of time of the pressure I just
couldn't take it anymore I couldn't take
it
try me crazy so I still keep at the end
of the videos but oh my gosh I could
take it I had to switch it up I love a
man - good morning struggling get out of
bed but I'm so glad that you're here yay
and let's see let's see what else is
going on here okay so it's really a
conversation and then I'm reading
between those few people Leslie's here
now we've got some more people joining
us Helen and spring and Stephanie oh she
said it's not showing up in her in her
subscriptions that she had to go to my
channel to find it
oh no well hopefully people will find us
eventually I hope I hope and good
morning to everybody else that I didn't
have a chance to say good morning to
we're gonna go ahead and start getting
ready now this is the and I'm just
having a regular day so I thought this
would be good because you know I mean
sometimes people just need new fresh
ideas for their everyday makeup look and
this is kind of what I want to do today
and we'll talk about what I'm gonna be
doing as I do it and you guys can have
input if you're in the live chat you
have input into what I'm using so the
first thing I want to start off with is
the Napoleon Paradis auto-pilot pre
foundation skin primer my friend Lily
sent this to me and my friend Lily
spurgeon on YouTube and I really like
this for a foundation primer on days
that I feel like I need more hydration
it's very moisturizing foundation primer
and I do rub it all over my face it's
just you know sometimes we pad sometimes
we rub I feel like with moisturizing
primers I feel like I want to rub it in
like a moisturizer with silicone primers
I know you're supposed to Pat it into
your pores but you know Stephanie a says
glad it's so happening and I found it
I'm glad you found it - I don't know
what's going on with that it's so weird
Helen said she posted in the what's up
of makeup face book group if you're not
a member of the Facebook group and you
like Facebook its groups / what's up and
makeup is the whole thing yeah and
beauty beholder says she always goes to
the channel oh it's happened this year
who love Tabitha
alright Tabitha is my production manager
she's amazing she helps me get my script
together she kind of rains all of the
reporters and gets it all organized for
me so that I can film which is something
I used to do myself
and it takes forever so she jumped in
and she helps with that she also does um
what's in the makeup calm she helps him
with that as well so she's amazing katha
Liz says gem for some reason didn't show
up on your subscription yeah I don't
know what's happening hopefully people
will find us I did put I did it the same
way I always do it and I also put a link
underneath what to the makeup in the
description so hopefully people would
find it
alright and Helen's like my facebook so
I've got my facebook my my I got my
facebook primer on what okay I also gods
I've got a couple of different things
I'm doing what I want to show you so I
got this this is the Miran s flawless
revolution anti-aging 3 and 124 skin 24
hours skin Perfector and SPF 15 the
problem with this as I got it too dark
it's really dark so I don't think I'm
gonna be able to use it it's got like
this little swirly guy here and that
looks like I might be in my skin tone
but then when I pump it out it is way
too dark
they I'm gonna have to wait and save
this one you won't have to save it it
makes me sad
it's like almost there it's almost there
it's really full coverage though mirror
and ass if you don't know it's an
Australian makeup brand and they're
really good stuff and nobody really
talks about mirror and that's actually
that's not too terrible no hmm this is
ya know 30 grams is doesn't want us if I
say 30 milliliters I don't know I don't
think I did so insistent about 30
milliliters it's um
you know it says it's a three-in-one 24
hour skin perfecting SPF 15 it's one
ounce it's one else but I also have this
product that I've been using a little
bit on periscope and I wanted to show
you I was I bought this on HauteLook
and I was a little disappointed in it
because what it showed on but--look was
three of these and I got three of these
little pans like this it looks like putz
butts and they're already starting to
dry out a little bit I am keeping it in
a selfie
like they've set you but it's already
certain drought so I think I'm just
going to use the highlighter out of here
but I do need to use this before it
completely dries out they give you this
little teeny tiny baby sponge but I did
really like the product when I used it
so when this does come back on the look
I am going to be buying a full size of
even Ella shade of this from here next
oh you know what I wanted to use that I
forgot airy space it's funny how you
know ten minutes ago I had an idea and
then I you know Nikki I already flipped
them over
I've already accessed that uh and that
trick and yeah we're starting to run out
of product here I already forgot I
wanted to show you this is the
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream I thought I could use that and see
what happens as far as it being a tinted
moisturizer and see if I need more
coverage and if I don't if I do need
more coverage then I'll put it on if I
don't I won't I figured I would try the
vanilla shade or the natural shade not
we're gonna go with natural usually I
can go with the vanilla but I think
we're gonna go with natural today cuz it
looks better
oh nice Amanda she said I was thinking
of I was excited for the step of shadows
thinking last night that's doing one on
all new drugstore makeup would be fun
yeah and I have a ton of it I just got a
big order from Milani we're gonna be
playing with some of the products that I
got from Milani I also got some indie
stuff I got some stuff from each cheek
cosmetics really playing with eyeshadows
from there else got this Milani
eyeshadow palette with that a little bit
all right I gotta flip back over I was
talking to people to chat but I have to
flip that over to my my screen so that I
can see myself you know what I can make
this screen a little smaller so I can
see the chat and myself at the same time
alright so let's see what happens with
this again this is the bare minerals
complexion rescue and natural nor 5 and
I know the camera quality isn't as good
as my typical videos but this is my
webcam it's supposed to be high
definition so I'm hoping that it
actually is this actually looks like a
very nice shade for me it might be a tad
bit dark but I think we're gonna go with
it be fine and we're going to use the
Beauty Blender not the beauty blender
the Real Techniques sponge it's
basically a Beauty Blender but for
looks we're going to bounce that on it
took me a long time to accept then I
need to bounce on this nut because it
takes longer to bounce and it's annoying
to keep hitting myself in the face
I really hate it
oh yeah everybody's excited about the
Milani maybe use a darker shade probably
to make the foundation work better maybe
that's a good idea
I mean we're gonna be good though it
will be re all right so that is a very
nice coverage I might just let that be
it's definitely I like coverage but
that's what I like
I don't like a full coverage well come
here looks weird on me it makes it look
like a met like I have a mask on like
I'm a doll or something it's just not
the look I like I like to look more
natural
I like that flat flawless but I like
that natural look on yellow closer its
it'll close without blurring hopefully
you can see it I feel like I'm blown out
let me turn this light off first I can't
see if that helps but I do like it like
on your living you know what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna get my mirror I have a
little tiny mirror that's unfortunate
they usually look at my little here to
see how I'm doing
maybe I can find a little palette with a
mirror in it use this way so I can
really see you don't we're gonna do
we're gonna cheat because I really like
this I don't want to do too much more
well I don't know I like yeah I'm a big
light coverage fan I see somebody up in
the chat saying me to be loader says I
like light coverage too or else my dry
skin gets pouchy yeah what I'm going to
do to kind of make up for it because it
is a little bit a little light I'm going
to use the Too Faced cocoa powder
foundation and light/medium it's a
really nice powder foundation if you
long just want to
your game just a little bit in the
coverage but you don't want to go
overboard it also saves you a step with
the powder so that's really nice and it
smells like chocolate like I'm really
happy with this purchase I got this a
while back but it really liked it a lot
it's just so if you like the smell of
chocolate it's a great way to start your
day who are the smell of chocolate you
have the chocolate bar palette you know
what I'm talking about
this smells exactly like the chocolate
bar palette it's got that exact same set
it's really nice and I like to pack this
on too because I feel like it helps to
push it into my skin rather than
brushing it away when I feel what I
brush I feel like sometimes I kind of
undo my foundation of my tinted
moisturizer or whatever and I don't want
to do that I wanted to be on my skin not
brushed over my skin you know what I
mean like I want it to be in there let's
say Terry Lee says your makeup for
what's on make it was on my mattress
shirt perfectly and brought out your lid
color oh thank you so much Terry Lee and
you know what's fun entirely and you
know this is that when I get ready on
periscope I get the opinions of all
these people so it's not just me coming
up with the looks it's everybody on
periscope that helps me come up with the
looks so I really have an unfair
advantage in getting ready in that I've
got at least 50 people and they're
putting in their two cents and what they
should be doing on my face so it really
helps a lot it helps a lot
all right so I wanted to show this to
you even though I'm not very excited
about this and thank you very much Terry
that was really sweet
so this I'm not very excited about I
don't really like it very much but I
want to show it to you anyway just
because it's new this is a Melania I
tech define two in one brow and eyeliner
felt tip pen I am going to use the
eyeliner too but this brow thing like I
don't know how many marker brow products
you used but for me I've never used a
marker on my brows and this is all
marker like no joke marker you show you
it looks like a marker it goes on like a
marker it's a marker like it's really
weird it's really weird my polygon oh my
goodness I feel like I'm so out of it
it's because I was I haven't got much
sleep lately but that's a whole other
story so we're gonna go ahead and do the
brows with this just so you can see how
it goes on I feel like with a spoolie it
it kind of helps with this ploy but
because it's not a powder product it
really it's a liquid it's a it's a
marker product so it doesn't really work
as well with a spoolie so I don't know
Kamisha says I don't understand why the
lab chat didn't show up in her
subscription YouTube didn't notify her
yeah I don't know what's up with that
either and everybody's saying the same
thing can you shed it's not just you hon
um all right so I'm going to go ahead
and try this and you can see it does
fill in my brows it works it's also a
little bit too light for my skin tone
nice skin tone for my hair color it's a
little reddish it's kind of got a red
tone and this is the dark brown shade so
if you have hair that's my color or
darker this isn't going to be dark
enough for you and it does give quite a
natural look in that it's not looking
like Instagram brows with I thought that
it would but I think that has to do with
the shade the shade is quite light so
let me sing you can see the difference
between my eyebrows so I mean it does
work it's just it's definitely not my
favorite um format here you decide and
I'm making sure not to go too low here
that's really important and I'm just
really just trying to stick with my
natural brow shape I do go to the
benefit brow bar Oh to get my eyebrows
done about once every month and a half
two months that's that's as often as I
need to go because they do they take
such care there when I went to other
places I would be going like every three
weeks to a month and it was ten dollars
and now I go every month to two months
and it's 20 dollars so for me it's
totally worth it even though it's like
really expensive I feel like it's
totally worth it because it lasts so
much longer for me so there's my brows
who is that key kg says I'm really
enjoying the micro bow from NYX in
Auburn right now
my gosh it's so good so but I need to
switch my shade though I actually gave
mine away because it was too late I need
to get one that's darker but when I did
use it even it was too late I did like
the formula a lot Julie says she thinks
that the eyebrow looks good and KJ says
that order my lips I don't know what
she's talking to somebody else about
lipstick I missed the train so I'm gonna
stop talking mr. Tremont thought on that
one amanda says because she got the NYX
tinted brow gel yesterday and so far she
really likes it and then Nancy says I
agree Jen they know they are doing they
know yeah I think that's what she said
it kind of went up really quickly they
know what they are doing at benefit yes
they do yes they do Vicky says markers
and brows are not something I want to
try yeah it's very weird and what
happened was is when I went on the
Lonnie's website I knew I wanted to
order a bunch of stuff I'm doing a
sponsored video for Harvey Prince they
have a new subscription box coming out
and it's a sponsored video so I was like
okay well I want to take the money that
they gave me and I want to reinvest in
the channel so I ended up spending on
the Lani stuff so they have like a kid
on Milani it's $50 and you get a bunch
of stuff you'll be able to see if you go
to milania's website the different kits
so that's why I got it I probably
wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't
for that it came in the kit I have to
make sure I don't lose and I'm looking
around frantically because I want to
make sure I don't lose it because I'm
here it is because I want to use the
eyeliner side now I'm going to see a
little bit but this is really not doing
anything with the product it's more just
evening out my brows and I think what
I'm going to do since this is a little
bit weak as far as the as far as how its
filling in my brows I'm going to use the
Maybelline brow drama over top of it to
kind of give me a little bit more color
Vicky's like Sharpie brows yeah exactly
I mean that's that's what's happening
here is Sharpie brows exactly what's
happening right so this product this
Maybelline brow drama I kind of like it
this ball is ginormous
you can see how big it is so if you have
small brows this is really difficult to
work with like it's difficult for me to
work with my brows aren't super small it
works nicely but it does tend to clump a
little bit so just be careful of that
that you want to kind of
you either spoolie it out or rub it out
with your finger after you use it and
it's definitely not like a full-coverage
kind of thing so you want to make sure
you use some kind of powder or pencil or
something with it it's more of a brow
gel than something that will actually
fill in my brows it's okay though it's
okay
tabatha says Harvey Prince mix
fragrances yes
oh my gosh they're the reason why I
accepted the sponsorship for it is
because I knew I was going to love it
Harvey Princess hello is one of my
signature scents I absolutely love it I
ran out of my one rollerball that I had
of it and now they've sent me a few more
roller balls of some other sense that
they had recently come out with and I'm
very excited to share them with you just
to show you that it exists it's very
very nice I'm really liking it I think
I'll give you a full review once I get
into the video but yes Jen could you do
a close-up of the brow after the marker
well I didn't show you let me see pull
it up pull it up here and that's after
the brow gel though is it focusing and
make sure that all this out here cover
up the background to make sure it's
focusing there we go so see how it's not
like totally filled in I can put a
little bit more so you can see well
that's not the right side that's the
eyeliner side look at that I'm about to
put some black eyeliner right there
Hardy princess is reasonable for um for
perfume see how it's like what is that
what is that I don't know what that is
it's not like got a blur out get around
my background there and my background is
blurring it that's like not it's not
doing what it's supposed to do this is
definitely not my favorite product on
the planet whisky and I wish the end of
this fully were smaller on the brow
drama oh I totally agree I totally agree
I see what their logic wall it's super
cute but I don't really work all right
for eyelid primer today we need to keep
going oh thank you Amanda and I got my
eyebrows done what like two weeks ago
something like that and they're still
looking good where they would look
Haggard if I had gotten them done at the
nail salon where I normally get them
this is
the elf eyelid primer I think this is
running out let's see yeah agreed
you don't blend the marker that's the
problem is you have to blend it with my
finger tips before it dries but once it
dries forget it it's done it's just not
a very functional product for me I don't
really enjoy it living in my my own
finally probably a lip primer is very
very good I don't feel like it's as
effective is my high-end ones but man
it's close it's good enough like for the
price difference if you're on a budget
it's good enough you know do you really
need that extra hour aware if you don't
just get the elf alright okay so now for
eyeshadow today I thought I would use
this kind of as a supplemental palette
and then go with some of these over here
now the shirt I'm wearing is similar in
tone to the shirt I was wearing for
what's up in makeup but I really really
really really really really really want
to use the shade this is called love
dragon and it's by it's by a geek chic
cosmetics and I'm so excited about the
shade it's like a glittery pink I don't
know it doesn't match it doesn't match
maybe we can make it match maybe we can
play with other colors and make it match
you know what we can't make it match I
don't think it's gonna work
mrs. rw4 one one says what was the gold
color on your eyes the both color on my
eyes this week was eight she cosmetics
and this is the Mockingjay shade that
was what was all over my eyes if you're
not if you want to know all of the
makeup that was on my face be good once
again makeup calm actually I don't and
I'm not sure if it's on there tabatha
right now
but usually I have a what's on my face
video and it'll tell you everything I
wore on my face that week I checked it
right before I went live and I didn't
see it on there so hopefully be on there
within the next hour or two
all right yes Mockingjay that's what I
said right
I said Mockingjay yes yes Mockingjay Oh
Lily's here my friend lilies were just
talking about you because I used my own
Napoleon Paradis face primer okay so you
know what I'm gonna switch it up and
instead we're going to use this green
this is called righteous man and this is
bye this is seviche cosmetics this is
from their supernatural collection if
you don't know I'm a huge supernatural
fan huge I love me some Dean I'm like
addicted oh my gosh and then maybe we'll
use a little bit of King of Hell here's
King of Hell it's like a grey and then I
also have an angel of Thursday which is
like a lady like silvery kind of
glittery shade you know we're going to
do this is we're going to do this is the
plan we'll use angel of Thursday all
over the lid and then we'll play with
the other colors as like accent colors
and then I'll use the Milani to use I
have the Harry Potter one we use the
Milani as like a crease color and stuff
to balance it out with some matte shades
this one I got was mischief managed
and this one is like a brown with some
like green glitters in it if you can see
them I can't see that very well but oh
my gosh it's gorgeous
it's gorgeous each she cosmetics is so
fun and this is my first order I've ever
gotten from them and I ordered it in the
hash tag not sponsor it's my money
hash tag not sponsored I just always
wanted to try their stuff oh my gosh
it's so fun so fun they have a Lord of
the Rings collection they used to have a
whole neverending story collection these
have a Princess Bride collection and now
all they have left is luckdragon from
the UM from the neverending story
collection so this one here is what is
the angel of Thursday this is a Castiel
color I'm just going to Pat that on the
center to the inner corner
and I am NOT a tutorial person just as
like a disclaimer I am NOT a makeup
artist I am a mom that started making
YouTube videos like I don't expect Pro
work here this is not pro work this is
me doing it works for me okay
and it may work for you so that's a good
thing okay so that is angel of Thursday
yes there we go stuff that is so smart
stuff a is on the same wavelength as my
other stuff she says Jan you should
collab with the company to make a
lipstick and call it hashtag not
sponsored that is genius that is genius
alright we're gonna go into this one
which is called righteous man which i
think is named after their father on
supernatural
we're gonna pop that in the outer corner
like outer third over to the side it's
funny because my other Stephanie the one
that's the moderator he or she's the one
who got me saying hashtag not sponsored
it's like her thing and the thing about
these live chats and might do things on
periscope is I get to know people you
know and it's fun to be part of a
community where I really feel like
people that I talk to on here are truly
my friends it's fun it's really fun I'm
really liking this so far you want to
kind of blend this up a little bit into
the crease but I'm going to use a little
bit of a transition color in just a
second from the Milani okay can you guys
see hopefully you can see the morning
Deanna the end is another pair of loves
if you guys can see blockout gotta go
like this to block out the background
that's how we're doing so far little you
guys can see they are glittery they're
definitely glittery you know what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do a little swatch
for you because I think in the swatch
you'll be able to see the glitter better
and I did do swatches on I know you
talked about Paris I apologize if that's
annoying
I did do swatches on periscope you can
see the glitter there
that's righteous man there you go you
can really see it yeah that makes me
happy that you can really see it
there's righteous man and then I'll
swatch angel of Thursday for you but not
all of the geek chic cosmetics are
glittery I tried to pick shades that
were unique and also because they're
super natural
so there's angel of Thursday right there
so there's righteous man there's angel
of Thursday and then we'll do you wipe
my fingers off okay so fizzy pop says
can you do a shout out for me remind
Helena Helena to come to the next chat
oh yes that's your friend Helena come to
the next chat Helion oh I thought was
something different all right Ashley
late but you're here I'm happy you're
here
that's okay and then this one's called
King of Hell and we'll play with this
one in just a minute but I want to
swatch it on my hand for you the angel
of Thursday want isn't as opaque there
is King of Hell it see the glitter in
there and that's angel of Thursday and
righteous man so there's the ones were
playing with today Jenna's here I'm so
glad you're here all right Terry Lisa
she just uploaded two new videos
terry lee nifty and thrifty on youtube
yay for terry lee lemon Terry Terry and
I are working on doing in collaboration
with a brush company that she loves and
I can't remember what it's called right
now but we're working on that
me and Terry lady collaborating I also
have a collaboration coming up with
Melissa from Mel mphs Melissa Autry teri
Lee what's the name of that brush brand
we're collaborating on I can't remember
it's a brush brain that she loves okay
so we're gonna do the Milani right here
and I'm just going to use that as a
crease color just as a transition and
then it's been a lot of discussion on
the beauty junkies thank you so much
beauty junkies brushes and I don't know
if you guys have experience with beauty
junkie brushes I'm just gonna put that
up this up in the crease just to kind of
blend things in a little bit now there's
been a lot of discussion on facebook
page of the purpose of transition shades
and its really just to create a shadow
it's kind of like contouring your
contouring your eyes so when you have
that shadow that shadow in your crease
you're making your eyelid pop and that's
kind of the purpose of it so anything
you put over top of it is just going to
be a tad bit deeper which will make um
make everything pop a little bit more so
that's the purpose of it so yes yes
there is a Sailor Moon collection on
geek chic cosmetics calm yes there is
there is there's a lot of things over
there you should totally check it out
and again hashtag not sponsored they
have no idea who I am
alright we're gonna go to King of Hell
we're gonna pop that as like a detailing
kind of shade and I hate to say how much
I love this brush but this is the Sigma
e30 brush and again they did not send
this to me I bought this at full price I
might use the coupon code somewhere but
I pretty much bought this at full place
I found a coupon code retailmenot.com is
amazing for coupon codes so every day
when I do my eyeshadow I do it pretty
much the exact same way I start off with
a shade that is similar to my skin tone
as far as deepness then I darken up my
outer corner and that's pretty much what
I do every single day
it's just with different colors so I
just follow the same pattern with
different shades so for you you're
having trouble with your eyeshadow you
usually define a pattern of how you like
your eyeshadows with light and dark once
you figure out how you like to apply it
you can use
any combination of colors that you liked
you just have to go with the tow and
stop thinking about the shades and start
thinking about the tongue cuz like for
me I know a lot of these beauty gurus on
YouTube like to use dark colors on the
lid I never use dark colors on the lid
because I feel like it puts that in
shadow and I don't want to put my lid in
shadow I want my lid to pop I want it to
stick out so I do like on my lid always
lisa says transition shades also help
make a gradient effect so it doesn't go
from super dark reshape to nothing
exactly Krista thank you for adding that
on I appreciate you yes and then Nikki
says you should you the shade closest to
your eyelid color first exactly but it
doesn't have to be your actual look and
actual skin tone any kind of color it
can be something that is in tone the
same as your eyelid color self for
example and I'm looking at this Revlon
palette all over my lid I'm gonna look
for a shade that's the closest to my
natural skin tone so I can use this one
ones that we use all over my lid would
be this one probably or this one maybe
this one but like these are kind of
light so really my best lint shades are
going to be probably these two here
because of their closest in tone I would
never use these up here all over my lid
because they're gonna put my lid and
shadow and then these here if I want to
go for a lighter look I can use kind of
these all over my lid but I mostly would
use these two these two here for lid
colors for me personally but then when
you have a deeper skin tone of course
you're gonna go deeper Jenna this oh
this starts at 10 a.m. Eastern time is
when it starts alright it's 10:30 - I
got keep rolling
all right now and as far as these
shadows I feel like they're not as
pigmented as I thought they were going
to be especially this one this righteous
man one I feel like you can't even see
it I need to I'm gonna try to pack on a
little bit more and hopefully we'll be
able to see it more because I really
want to see this green and I can't see
it that's bothering me
all right let's try this again we're
gonna pack it over here just a little
bit more there we go that's a little bit
better but I don't know if you're gonna
be able to see it on the camera I can
see it in this mirror but I mean these
shades are really muddying together and
it's not making me happy at all and I'm
just patting that right there there you
go
okay and now I'm gonna go back into did
that just blur out I'm sorry by focusing
on the cover of the palette I'm gonna
try to watch that for next time
I aim me how you doing girlfriend I just
saw my friend Amy's here all right I'm
gonna go ahead and put go back in with
angel of Thursday and see if I can bring
this up a little bit
you might have to use some kind of copy
papi because this is not popping the way
I wanted to
all right well that's better it's
poppity pop it now and then we're just
gonna need to blend that a little bit
okay so now I'm gonna get to finish up
the eye look I'm gonna get a fluffy
block brush blush blush I do that when I
feel much of a makeup all the time I
accidentally say blush instead of brush
and brush instead of blush all the time
just kind of blend that out just to make
sure that it's um that it's blended yeah
I think that's a piece that a lot of
people miss when I see people with eye
shadow when they've used more than one
color they forgot to use the blending
brush at the end and it's critical to
really blend out where you've
transitioned from one shape to another
it really makes a big difference in her
eye look okay I'm gonna use a little bit
of this Milani shadow this one over on
the side just as a brow bone highlight
because if I'm missing anything over in
the chat um II Beth says did we ever
hear who talked he decided to collab
with it was wishing so hard for Jen you
know why um who was it one of somebody
that that I talked to on here and I
can't remember who and I feel really bad
that I can't remember so they talked to
her at generation Beauty and she said
she hasn't picked anybody yet because
she's been so busy but she's still
working on it
so there's a lot of good people that can
do it so as long as you pick somebody
cool that's what I care about so I'm
gonna just start over here because I'm
scared I don't want it to be too poppy
oh my brow bone because I feel like it
can be a little too much and I'm gonna
focus really underneath the brow bone
like underneath my eyebrow instead of
focusing like down here just to give
that pop under the eyebrow right in the
middle there and now that I've got this
open
I see the shade combust I need a little
bit more matte going on over here
I had it open I thought you know what I
really need that shade it's right here
must it's very nice
I'm gonna blend that out all right and I
look is finished we got him alone
we got a move on girlfriend yeah Tati
was in Paris last week Helen says that
is true girlfriend is busy she is busy
all right good morning Heather how are
you all right yes all right so we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna use the
Milani eye tech define two and when brow
eye definer pen we're gonna use the the
liner sign now one thing I learned about
this I did use this for the first time
this week is when I winged it out like
within an hour of me being at work my
friend Mary Lynn came up to me and she
was like Jan you have black all over the
side of your face I was like I do
eyeliner thank you for telling me
because it was bad it was horrible so
I'm never gonna wing this out ever again
with this liner and that's okay because
you don't need a wing every day you
don't need a wing every day does not
happen every day you don't have to use
every single product every single day
you know you have to do what makes you
happy what makes you comfortable then
the point on this thing is so good so
good it's so fine perfectly because some
tips are too soft and some tips are too
hard and this one's just perfect
sorry if it's going in and out of focus
it stuff says its own and we try to get
it don't mean if you ain't got that way
do I have to watch what you watch watch
watch wrong I was never meant to be a
singer
never ever but it's so fun you know you
should do what makes you happy and even
though I don't see well it makes me
happy and it seems to make my friends
happy when I sing so I said alright I'm
trying to do this this isn't the way I
typically like all this crossover
business I've got going on it's not the
way I typically do this but because I am
doing this live I can't do it the way I
normally do it which is up close
normally I would go up to my mirror like
this and put it on like this but I can't
see it in the screen right now thanks
for the time check Helen appreciate it
yes I put like my eye shadow up in the
crease I go that's the song that's the
jam alright let me make sure I'm even
here now that this is done let me get a
little closer how am I looking
I'll be looking little tiny wing no baby
wing if you're scared of doing a wing
this is the kind of wing you can start
off with just extend it the tiniest
little bit the tiniest little bit and
that's the way you get going doing a
wing just do a little level Estonia's
little triangle off the edge of your
eyelid and then go a little further the
next time and a little further the next
seven when you get comfortable you know
that we sang I did a story time with my
son my four-year-old and we did Maurice
Sendak books and we did one was Johnny
and we did Pierre and I say the books to
him
all right Kayleigh is here hello
get fit with Kayleigh on periscope yes
my friend Kayleigh all right one thing I
did want to show you because I meant to
put this in my monthly favorites is the
benefit tinted primer that their real
tinted primer because it wasn't going to
be in the top it was going to be
somewhere in the middle because I think
it's kind of mediocre but I just want to
show you because this is a pretty new
product and I haven't showed this
anywhere else so there you go that's how
it's got the little cookies at the end
like the mascara and it is pretty soft
to go on which is very nice it is let's
see it's very soft to go on it doesn't
make your eyelashes feel crunchy and you
want just a very natural tip to your
eyelashes it's perfect now as far as its
ability to add awesomeness to your
mascara it's okay I definitely like my
Lancome sales boost your excellent and
much much better but it's very nice I
mean you can tell the difference let me
see if I can get a little close so you
can see the difference between my lashes
so this side has it with and without so
it's very natural so if you just look
like a like seriously no makeup and you
just want your eyelashes tested this is
this will give you the tiniest bit of
length just the tiniest bit which is
very nice hello Lisa
alright let's go on this side benefit
I wish benefit would do more products I
feel like they just keep reinventing the
same old products over and over again
and releasing kits of the same products
over and over again I mean they released
so many products like this one but it's
still like there's nothing like
innovative you know it's like new like
yes you know I'm waiting for benefit to
have their big bang
in fact they just haven't had it yet
their packaging is so stinking super
cute yes that says benefit bores me to
no end I mean it's like I want them to
be amazing and I feel like they can be
amazing they just need more poof and
pizzazz like I need a new thing I know
what that new thing is but if they paid
me I would think about it I'm just I'm
totally kidding now Ben event has no
interest in me at all all right we're
gonna do the Maybelline New York lash
sensational luscious mascara we're gonna
do that over top you know like yeah get
like you know I know he's they're good
tight with mani and Patrick maybe mani
and Patrick to help them come up with
something cool you know maybe they
enlisted the right people to come up
with like awesome ideas and steal some
of these drugstore formulas these
drugstore formulas are better than iron
formulas pretty good pretty good
and then who is that Monica says I wish
benefit would put more product in their
products I like like they're all tiny
yeah they do have a lot of tummies gimme
brow lisa says she loves the gimme brow
I like the gimme brow I don't love to
give me brow but I like it
amanda says she finally bought her first
urban decay products that's cool
hopefully you like them I had to walk
past the Gwen Stefani blush palette and
go no I am NOT looking at it I'm nots
watching it I'm not going near it cuz I
don't need it I want it so bad but at
some point you just have to say no not
doing it but I do want it really bad
all right look at that oh my gosh so
this is one coat with the benefit you
see you can see hopefully you guys can
see it because it looks really washed
out to me over here Shanna says she
loves coralista lisa says are you going
to scope today probably not I would
probably not be on periscope today I
might start doing a little bit of
snapchat though because I feel like I'm
missing a boat on snapchat I feel like I
need to do more snap chatting I'm Jen
Lowe's reviews on there I have very
little content on there just a tiny bit
but I want to do more on snapchat
there's just so many people on snapchat
and I need to not fight it and just do
it just do it
all right mascaras done I just want to
do a little tad bit more on there but
probably no periscope today this is kind
of my periscope for the day because it's
just like what I do in Paris good all
right so we've got 17 minutes left we
need to get rockin here Kristin says yes
the snapchat I need you so if you're not
following me on snapchat know that the
snapchat content is going to be
increasing soon who is that Oh nanny
says benefit used to make an awesome zip
concealer they don't make it anymore oh
no Sarah says she loves the rocket to
her blush which i swatched but I don't
own it
Christa so she needs start doing
snapchat too and how one says one thing
about snapchat is you you can use it
when you can and not be so
time-sensitive yes and that's what I
like about it so I'm really looking
forward to using it more all right so
another thing hi Gina yup you're pretty
late that's okay we got 15 minutes left
Gina you're not too late my friend Gina
hi Gina mom
all right two-faced little black book of
bronzers I found this at my local
Nordstrom Rack for $25 oh I had to get
it I had to get it had to get it
so yes oh my gosh the reason why I had
to get this is because I felt like I
wanted this for comparison so then I had
I had me so that
but sorrow the drugstore bronzer I could
say this is a dupe for the dark
chocolate Soleil bronzer you know what I
mean which I didn't own chocolate so
we're gonna go ahead and start with pink
leopard which I am in love with they
never would have bought this in a
million years never and we're gonna put
that right there
just all over the blush area I never
would've bought this and I love the
shade and the lasting power is so good
so so good so if you can find this at
your Nordstrom Rack oh my gosh I've
never even seen to you facing horse
around I didn't even know that Nordstrom
sold to face look where did this even
come from
look what Oh a man is that she finally
got the notification oh no notifications
finally went out that makes me sad
YouTube failed you to fail all right so
that's the bronzer we're using for
contour I really want to show you in
action because I talk about it all the
time
the elf contour palette I want to show
it to you in action because this thing
is so good so good six bucks for gulfs
website I'm going to use this Yves pearl
fan brush but you can use any kind of
contour brush I don't feel like if you
use some kind of fancy schmancy brush a
little bit of product on there okay
there's a mirror for not yeah and we're
gonna just kind of go right to the top
of the ear and we're gonna go down to
the corner of the mouth the focusing
most of the product closer to the ear
can you guys see that is it for an
everyday look I don't put a ton of
contour on hopefully you can see that I
don't know if you can I can't see it it
doesn't look like I can see it like that
you guys can see it because I don't know
I think it's the webcam and I'm focusing
the product back toward the ear I think
that's where a lot of people mess up one
contour where I used to mess upon
contour was focusing the product evenly
throughout but you really want to focus
closer to the ear I don't know if you
guys can sing but this thing is amazing
it's so good I feel like I'm washed out
move I'm in the back a little bit you
can see it right there
I feel like I need to overdo it a little
bit just so you can see it this is
totally worth the six dollar purchase
totally worth it
you don't feel like you need to over
contour for the daytime you know alright
so now I'm going to blend it up just a
little bit with this Real Techniques
brush just a little bit and then the the
leopard really handled my highlight I
don't know if you can see it but there's
tell me a highlight going on I feel like
I want a more though like maybe I want a
little more highlight I'm a highlight
junkie I love me some highlight man love
I just wanted to like BAM like that's
something I will do instagram-worthy if
I will pop my highlight like nobody's
business
alright we're just gonna do a little bit
of more highlight we're gonna use this
just came back I want to show you if you
were looking at this this sold out on
sephora's website over the holidays and
now it's back at $65 but I really really
feel like it's worth it if you want to
invest in some good contouring products
it's really really nice I'm the only
thing is is if these cool shapes tend to
money on you you're not going to want it
but um oh raised here high right but
it's a really nice product yeah I'm
these eyeshadows are so nice they're so
nice I'm gonna use a cabin light powder
me is that same fan brush and we use a
candle light powder and put that on the
tops of my cheekbones and that's all I
ever highlight I don't go crazy and do
you like the crazy highlighting that a
lot of people do I just like comp it on
the top of the cheekbones and being done
with it so there you go so this is
everyday calmness this isn't like for
filming you love my hair thank you so
much I appreciate that
alright um let's do lips now this is
where we have to make a choice of what
we're gonna do for lips because I am
terrible at picking my lip color I'm
horrible at I'm absolutely horrible at
it so I got all these amore lip creams
all of these I got number one which is
adorable I got number 25 which is of the
lore I got number 26 which is fling and
I got number 12 which is loved and I got
number
which is precious so we need to figure
out what shade I'm going to wear today
and I think I'm going to veto this one
and this one because I think I want to
go cooler today since my eye shadow look
as cooler know if you guys can see the
shades there I feel like that's not true
to color at all hate that that they're
not true to color you flip them on their
side so you can see love for Valentine's
that you think let's try it well love
the only thing love is kind of warm tone
and I wanted to go cool toned so you
know I'm gonna do I'm gonna try precious
and see how it goes red for Valentine's
Day but see then I'm doing a little I
don't know I think I want to do pink for
Valentine's Day you don't want to go
pink I don't know I'm not feeling the
red and also I don't wear red on every
day I wear a Pink's on me every day so
I'm trying to do like a um you know like
a look what I would wear every day so
I'm gonna try this one and I am NOT a
lipliner person I do not use lip liners
these I'm lazy I just do that and
thankfully my lips match up pretty
nicely so I can just kinda like that
this should be the product I mess over
here a little bit got a new liquid
lipstick no this is I really like the
way that looks by the way we're looking
pretty good I do think it's a little too
pink it's a little too much house
scaring me a little bit so we're gonna
do what I always do when it's a little
too much and I'm going to use Bofors
Angeles this is my saving lipstick if
you buy nothing else from Oprah for your
entire life
Bofur Angeles is amazing okay it is so
good so good and the reason why it's so
good is watched this is what I do I'll
pop it
mom yeah blender
I have instant ombre lips no matter what
and see now I feel like that saved my
lip color it's not quite as bright as it
would have been yes love it now this is
the thing the Milani lip liquid
lipsticks are so drive on me I hate the
way they feel I absolutely hate the way
they feel so I wanted to use a lip balm
under top it's gonna grab a random lip
balm and I'm gonna throw it over top
because I cannot stand the way they feel
and that kind of kills the ombre a
little bit but it's still there you can
see it's still there the the over ones
are not drying they're more like a
mousse II texture but these are very
very drying on me like I feel horrible
so I like the way that it looks the
other thing is is I always whenever I
look at myself when I'm all finished I
always look at my lower lashline and go
I need a little something-something on
my lower lashline so we're gonna go
ahead and do that right now I think I'm
going to use go back into the righteous
man by each sheet which is the green and
pop that on my lower lashline really
quickly and then our look will be
finished and then we can just hang out
for a few minutes and just I can swatch
things if you want me to swatch things
like if you know that I own something
and you want to see a swatch of it then
I'm open source watching things for you
or if you want an opinion on something
I'm just gonna look at the chat window
and do whatever you guys want to do Oh
Thank You Astrid says your lips look so
good thank you so much Shannon says I
bought Angeles a few weeks ago and
that's awesome all of my two dark shades
were wearable now yeah oh I know it's
amazing I wish that Oprah would market
it like that and I don't know if this is
dark enough because on my lower lashline
I feel like I need something a little
darker so this is what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna pop in - nope I can't it's not
dark enough either and that's to warm I
can't use that we're gonna go back into
the Milani and I'm going to use this
matte brown on the bottom here
and I mix that in with the black don't
be afraid of black black is just a
darkening color don't think that you're
gonna end up with goth eyes if you use
some black it's not a big deal
beauty blogger 101 I did my eyeliner a
little bit earlier the way that I do
eyeliner is I stick as close as I can to
the upper lash line and then throw a
wing if you're just starting off with a
wing you want to just do a small wing at
first the smallest little wing you can
do and then slowly over time as you get
more comfortable extend it there we go
and whenever I do my lower lashline I
only go a little by only go part way and
that's just a personal preference I'm
not sure like trending lines like what
the deal is with that but I don't like
my my line liner going all the way
across it is way too much way too much
so that is the finished look how are you
looking I feel like I need to like spin
you around a bit
I'm gonna take my webcam off so excuse
me if it's jiggling I'm gonna try to go
slow but I need a different lighting see
there we go it's like almost like a
GoPro alright so that's the finished
look and I can't see myself right now
all I can see is the camera lens but I
wanted to show a different angle in the
light so you can sting to see how it's
looking as far as them but I look and
again I am NOT a makeup artist this is
just me being a mom and a teacher
playing with makeup so okay so now I'm
gonna spin you back around trying to I
don't wanna make anybody sick and I'm
gonna clip you back on there we go okay
alright so I'm very happy with this look
I think it came out great thank you for
getting ready with me we've got five
minutes so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to oh I'm going to show you a
little bit of my room so right there you
see that chair that's that's where I
film once I've been makeup so that chair
right there and my script is still
sitting there from filming and then
there's my light so I take another light
and I set it up the light that I have
over in this corner to light the front
here and I set it up so that it's
shining that way and you recognize over
here this is
my stuff were where I film my other
videos so just so you know a little bit
of background a little bit a little bit
and then this is just enough left over I
still have this sitting out from my my
favorites video you know I think
sometimes stay out a little longer than
they should so let's see Gina says oh
it's the window behind you it keeps
refocusing every time you move so it's
blurry today catch you later love you
love you too Gina yeah that might be it
but I don't have any curtains there's
like nothing that I can do so you know I
need to get curtains for that window um
Joshua
hello Joshua welcome to the live chat do
you like makeup that would be awesome if
you did Beauty vlogger 101 says how did
you start your channel I really need
subs okay I you don't need subs don't
don't think about that don't think about
that that's the number one mistake that
people make is their life I need more
subscribers now you know no you know you
need to put out good content that's what
needs to happen you need to focus on
what you can control you can't control
your number of subscribers well you
can't control your content so you need
to focus on putting out awesome stuff
and putting it out consistently if you
put out awesome stuff consistently the
subscribers will come but you can't
control them you will burn out if you
focus on your numbers don't do it that's
my number one advice don't do that
shop miss a I saw a question show up and
say I've never tried anything from shop
miss a so the question was how did I
start my channel how did I start my
channel I've got my video camera and I
made a video and and it's really just as
simple as that when it comes down to it
I mean if YouTube is not something that
people that ever you know people can't
just do you know you just get a video
camera and just go there's lots of tips
and tricks I've done a few videos on
tips and tricks on how to start a
YouTube channel and and different advice
that I have for you but you know it's
really not difficult to start what is
difficult like you're saying is getting
an audience but you just have to just
keep going I remember Melissa Melissa
Raymond and I'm Melissa Autry that I'm
gonna be collaborating with she gave me
great advice in the beginning she I was
I remember talking to her I had about a
thousand subscribers and she had about
four
maybe and I emailed her is the first I
might ever talk to her and she said you
know she's like just give it a year
she's a give it a year let your audience
grow naturally just push it out for a
year and see where you are and
reevaluate and I thought that was really
great advice and I'm so glad that I
followed that you know that you you
really have you can't expect your
channel to blow up instantly with like
three videos you can't expect to have
more than 20 views within three videos
so you know you just you just have to
keep going you can't give up alright so
I'm gonna read some other other things
I'm Gina says I wasn't going to comment
again but yes Jen could comment you
focus on some you're not in it for the
right reasons and you'll never be happy
it's just you can't focus on things you
can't control and you really need to
think about can I control this yes I can
control it or no my cat if you can't
control it then do what you got to do if
you can't control you've gotta let it go
you gotta go it go
Mandy says she doesn't like Melissa
Audrey oh I like Melissa she's a very
nice person she's a really really nice
person but everyone has their own
opinions every time they're in their PJs
but I love Melissa let's see a beauty
vlogger 101 okay I love you advice I've
oh thank you oh good I'm so glad Kelly
says I still don't know how you manage
to do these shows every Sunday with your
kids hobby and being a teacher when I
taught everything happened on Sunday and
I just have to make time and and doing
all this you in your life in general you
make priorities of what's important and
there are certain things that become
priorities and certain things that don't
and I have made YouTube a priority I
have decided that is going that's very
important now today I said mommy will
you play slam watch with me and I'm
sitting here thinking about how much
editing I had to do and I put my editing
down I played slam which with my son
because I needed to make that a priority
you know I mean you just have to decide
what's most important so number one
priority for me it's my family my
husband is a huge help he's taking care
of my kids right now well he's take care
of Lila him and Lila went to go run
together in a park that's not so far
from here because Lila is I'm working on
running that's like her new thing is
being a runner little johnny is hanging
on the iPad because that's what he loves
to do but after this
John is getting off the iPad and we're
spending time together then we're having
a family day so it's it's one of those
things where you know you have to put in
order like in the mo what's most
important what you have to do so you

Burrell and Ogun says I love your
channel and I love you but how old are
you sorry I was just wondering you look
really young and for you oh thank you so
much I'm 37 years old
37 and a half technically I'll be 38 in
June middle beginning of June which I
don't feel 37 at all not at all
Tracy says hey Jen how do you feel about
the amount of repetition on makeup
YouTube channels is all the same product
same look same halls with the same
products I don't know I've been really
noticing it recently okay this is what
you do you're noticing the same the same
the same the same you want you want to
subscribe from those people that are
doing the same the same the same thing
if you're bored you want subscribe if
you're bored with me feel free to
unsubscribe I don't want anybody
subscribe it's bored you know what I
mean like you have to find channels that
excite you and you may circle back to
those old channels that you loved once
but you and another thing I've noticed
is that the people with the best ideas a
lot of times have a hundred thousand
subscribers or less it's those big
channels that I feel like sometimes fall
flat it's not always true there's
definitely some unique content and
bigger channels like toffee from lamp my
fruit for example I never get bored with
her videos man I I can't I'd never get
bored there always should always got
something new so like um you know
channels like Cassie from thrift pick a
redhead PhD who was here earlier I don't
know if she's still here but such a
unique contents you know just so many
really good
channels that aren't huge channels but
are really rocking the content and are
unique and there's there's a lot of
unique content out there it's just
finding it and and a lot of people do do
the same videos over and over again and
and don't wanna do anything fresh and
new I try to avoid that but sometimes
people don't like my fresh new concepts
a lot of people love routine and they
love you know seeing the same things
over and over again which is totally
fine but you know I don't know I just
feel like you have to find channels that
you really love really really love Amana
says gender Tamara was really my
favorite right now I am your just so
down to earth and fun to watch thank you
so much to me because I do put my heart
and soul into this channel and I feel
like it is a representation of me
Christa says stephanie nicole is very
smart very true another excellent
youtube channel especially if you like
liquid lipsticks that girl is your girl
she is your girl I don't understand
there's a comments as I want to learn
the way painted cat please I don't
really know what that means
I'm sorry Patricia Anna pretty
colour-pop ultra stained swatches on
every channel yes because they just said
on all their promo stuff I saw a dream
it's Giuliana's first and I love her
they just sent her all their promo stuff
I don't get from my stuff from
colour-pop that's why I don't have one
but I would have put one out there I'll
tell you if it said it to me I would
have put it out I promise you it would
have been on my channel to Caucasus you
have kids yes I have two kids I have a 7
year old and a 4 year old a second girl
4 year old boy and then Stephanie says
Jen you are doing something very unique
in terms of growing community I try
really hard and I think that's really
important to me to have this be a
community of people because on my own I
feel like I'm so much weaker than I am
with a group people like you know that I
think it's a Chinese story where they
talked about the stick and then the
bundle of sticks
do you know time now I'm pretty sure
it's Chinese origin where you know they
have the maybe the ruler who takes a
twig and snaps it and says this is how
you are alone and then takes a bundle
sticks and tries to break it and you
can't and that's the way I feel like our
community here is is that we are a
bundle
like together you can't break us like
you can't we have so much knowledge and
we help each other so much here that
it's just you know there's no stopping
us when we work together but me by
myself I feel like it's nothing compared
to the way that I am with you guys so
I'm gonna go ahead and go let me see oh
I just showed you my baby sister your
channel and she won't get my laptop back
that's how amazing you are sorry for
being okay I just love you so much and
Leslie says I love the community Jenna
you've got great community of wonderful
people and people are wonderful that's
the thing people are wonderful and we
have like very few we like to have no
drama like knock on wood we have like no
drama in our community like on the West
makeup app once I make a Facebook page
once it make a forum on once it make
up.com no drama it's just really nice
people
awesome and in the comments here you
know you mean like everybody is super
nice and it's so great I love it so I'm
just looking forward to a community
growing even more so I'm gonna go ahead
and go because it is 11:05 or five
minutes past we're 5 minutes past the
time but I want to spend some
Valentine's Day time with my family so I
was even pausing before I say goodbye I
took off my throat so I want to thank
you guys so much for joining me today
that was a lot of fun getting ready
together I definitely leave some
comments down below of some suggestions
of things you'd like to see in chat in
the future definitely make sure that
there are ideas of things that we can
carry over for a complete our the
history of makeup was a suggestion made
by someone in the community by Keiji so
anybody that has any suggestions for
that I would appreciate it because you
know you go through topics pretty
quickly I'm sure so any suggestion that
we leave those in the comments down
below the video once a trend or
