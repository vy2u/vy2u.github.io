out loud so we can all learn together
and grow in this land of knowledge of
makeup awesomeness and not so
awesomeness so we can all save each
other money so that's why i love these
chances because it isn't just about me
it's about everybody it's about you know
all of us working together to to learn
about makeup so we learn more that way
when we work together instead of one
person spouting out all of the
information so i'm just going to take a
second and say hi to people that are
here um barbara says I always watch the
reruns but this would be the first time
I get to watch live yay hello Barbara
and New Hampshire hi Jennifer good
morning I'm doing pretty well I got an
extra hours sleep last night which is
sweet which means i got five hours
instead of four which is like yay makes
me happy hello andy kitty one good to
see you good morning to Sammy good
morning to Leanne got some coffee and
leftover Eminem it's perfect perfect
I've just got my coffee John came up and
gave me a Rolo earlier he's like mommy I
saved you this rule oh my four-year-old
and I was like I love you so much right
now like if no idea so I already had my
role oh I had my breakfast which was
leftover sushi and I had some got some
coffee so we're ready to go good morning
to Elena in Delaware good morning tool
is in Oregon my girl Liz everybody's
eating candy this morning good morning
to Leslie good morning to Tabitha um
Sammy says what's for breakfast i'm
hungry having a smoothie for now yeah i
had sushi i had cold sushi and it was in
amazing um mesa i'm gonna say may so
good mornings anyone know when a live
chat is supposed to start it is now a
said 10 a.m. thank you so much Sammy for
clarifying good morning too deep on
India hello tifa so good to see you my
friend steph good morning i am in an
eastern time zone so thank you very much
for clarifying tabatha ah let's see
candy hangover for everybody let's say
on in a minute lots of good mornings you
know i'm gonna do i'm just gonna say
good morning to everybody because i want
to go ahead and jump in to the
discussion so good morning to everybody
i'm sorry if i didn't get this saying
your chit your name emily and re i'm so
glad this is your first time here i'm so
happy that you're here and morally and
I'm definitely feeling that candy
hangover hi to Krista so good to see you
at my monthly obsessions calm so good to
see you my dear good morning to Tyler
Tina says she doesn't have any candy no
kids and no trick or treating our area
Oh see then you go today that's what you
do is you get the candy sales today my
husband and my kids just left to go to
the halloween store to go get fifty
percent of Halloween decorations for
next year because they wanted to be epic
next year lash did it this if you were
on if you're on my periscope you saw our
decorations out front that John did but
he wants it to be even better so what
two notes high-end is a just a price
point well for that for the purpose of
this show it is just the price point I'm
technically high-end is like Burberry
you know YSL Kevin a quan when you get
to that kind of ridiculous price point
like your but we're gonna we're going to
clarify hi and that's why have it in
quotation marks for the purposes of this
video high-end is going to be anything
that's more expensive than don't think
you would get it support anything you
would get on the prestige section at
Ulta so this goes is as inexpensive as
like benefit you know the rock two-faced
like those kinds of price range urban
decay we're going to call that high-end
for the purpose of this video because
you know there are I would say the
majority of people in the country that
is expensive you know like most people
in our country do not get door and all
of that so I feel like if I only focused
on those products number 1 i'd have like
six products to talk
and number two most people it wouldn't
apply to so we're going to call high and
anything that is more expensive than
drugstore sephora ulta prestige when you
go into the department stores and you go
to the counters we're gonna say Mac as
high-end all of that so oh no blurry let
me see how's that is that better you can
go ahead and see if you can change your
quality um I don't know mm my connection
is strong I don't know why it would be
blurry that's so weird I don't know
hopefully it's nothing on my ends cuz I
don't know how to fix if it is anyone
else having ish okay audio is fine too
but the oh man yucky oh man small to and
out of focus no way let's see if I can
change the settings see mine says it
goes up to 720 HD so see if you can
change your quality pictures less blurry
cuz mine goes up to 720p for quality so
if you click on that and if it doesn't
fix okay it looks like seems like that's
working for some people alright thank
you to those of you who are being so
patient for the conversation here uh
Angie's so good to have you here first
time yes thank you steph for doing the M
refresh and yes thank you so much
alright so let's go ahead and start
jumping into some products now what I
did this time because I didn't have an
extra hours of sleep I got everything
set up and see I got a bunch of things
behind me for us to talk about these are
some of my high end products and I think
here we might start with like just
talking about kind of the way we put on
our face so let me say it doesn't come a
description box that he's put on a wish
lifts yes summer I'm with you alright so
prime or wise I feel like it's very rare
for me to find a primer like a face
primers specifically that I feel like is
worth paying extra for like like this
one this is the cover FX illuminating
primer it's a nice primer but for me
personally with my normal skin I don't
see a lot of difference with primer with
face primer um you know I see a little
bit of a difference but I don't feel
like it's enough to spend a lot of money
like if somebody was getting started and
makeup
I would tell them unless you have like
super oily skin or super dry skin i
would say skip the face primer I don't
know is that just me like am I the only
one I don't know I'm curious to see
what's going to happen and chat over
here but face primer I'm just not
feeling it i use it like i feel like
with dry skin you know you get one of
those moisturizing face primers and it
helps and I think that's nice and I feel
like with oily skin you know you get
like a silicone based primer and that
can help I do like this cover FX primer
but I don't know if like it's worth the
price you know what I mean the
difference is worth the price even
though I do enjoy it if that makes sense
so for face problems I'm like well for
see Jackie says a primer is a must for
her and nikki says that she likes the
hourglass primer she has to deluxe
samples and can't lie probably gonna
purchase a full-size JJ says the pore
filler for her nose but no other so poor
fillers I can totally understand that
totally get um Tyler says she's super
picky about primers because she has
super dry skin and then Krista is
agreeing with Nikki with the hourglass
primer actually says she has very dry
skin without a primer for foundation
doesn't stay so it seems like we're kind
of on the same thing that normal skin we
may not need it as much we're only
talking about the photo of the Polish
toys oily skin primer and she loves it
I'm it's going really really fast so I'm
gonna do as many as I can um Tyler
saying she loves the it cosmetics serum
primer works great for dry skin nikki
says some iridescent or something and it
is just amazing tabs Tabitha this is
different Tabitha Tabitha says there's
two Tabitha's now Tabitha yes she has to
make up for ever power but she doesn't
know how she feels about it see that's
the way I feel about a lot of primers
you know like I have this one you see
say no more arguing oh man this is the
Smashbox photo finish pore minimizing
primer I personally really like this I
feel like that it fills in pores like
John bought this my husband John bought
this when he was playing around with
makeup and he has bigger pores than I do
and he we were trying it on our hands to
see like how it work and this stuff
really did work but I've heard a lot of
people complain that they don't like
this primer so I don't oh no as far as I
primer though I'm going to go ahead and
skip down because I wish I've read every
single comment this would take forever
on amazed it says I don't wear prime in
those days I don't see much need for it
yeah i mean i feel like the makeup
industry tries to convince us that we
need every single product that they sell
in their line and i feel like with
primers normal skin people don't
necessarily need primers you know what i
mean like it seems like the oily skin
girls and the dry skin girls really feel
like they need it but us normal skin
girls are not really digging it and he
says when i use primers i find my
foundation moves around i don't know how
much to apply but the general rule that
I learned from Wayne Goss is you put on
as little as possible to cover a very
thin layer of your skin for face primer
indicating one says she likes face
primer but Nick's is good enough for her
alright I'm going to go ahead and move
over Tyler says I want to try to hide a
hangover RX primer it's next to try on
our list Lee Anne says she's beginning
using the covergirl outlast Rimmel stay
matte primers both are working pretty
well for her little et zone alright
let's go ahead and move on to I primers
now the eye primer that I pulled out was
the Urban Decay primer potion now this I
feel like does make my eyeshadow last
longer if you have oily lids I feel like
I shadow primer is kind of important for
you at least from people that I've heard
that have oily lids that eyeshadow
primer is like an absolute must I've
also heard that for people with dry skin
that they feel like they need an
eyeshadow primer to make the products
stick for me personally I do feel like
that I primer is something that makes my
eyeshadow last longer but if I'm was
just starting off in makeup what I say
that I primer is a must for me I would
say no just because like you know if
you're working an 8-hour day your
eyeshadows gonna fade during day it's
really not something that I feel like
you have to wear you know what I mean
unless you have only skin or dry skin
like we were single especially oily lids
now the one thing though that I feel
like is a must to have at least for me
is a prep that is an eye primer that
mutes out discoloration in my eyelids um
you know I just read a comment let's say
lists as the Smashbox primer waters
great for normal skin it makes your
makeup less a long time awesome and then
Christine wants to know if I have
an opinion on the lorac i shadow primer
I feel like it doesn't do anything for
me that's just me though but anyway so
the urban decay
I feel like does work I feel like it's
definitely worth it for people that have
problem eyelids the anti-aging one a
fizzy pop is saying the anti-aging one I
agree i like the anti-aging one better
than the original that's just me
personally I feel like if I use it
consistently I do see less wrinkles in
my eyelids and I know you think that
you're looking at me like girlfriend you
don't have any wrinkles but my eyelids
are definitely not as fun I am 37 so I
eyelids are not as taut as they used to
be and they they definitely need like
the anti-aging thing it definitely works
but what I was saying about the
discoloration I feel like like Max paint
pot and parently I feel like this is
totally worth the hype every bit of the
height that max Paint Pot apparently
gets its really really nice to mute out
discoloration in my eyelids now as far
as somebody with that I saw I have an
old swatch from yesterday excuse that as
far as someone with a deeper skin tone I
would imagine this would also work well
just because it's nice to have like a
neutral base to start almost like the
way a lot of people use them the next
pencil in milk I would imagine this will
kind of do the same thing for a deeper
skin tone just to kind of give a little
bit of a lighter base to really lay
those colors on top but I definitely
definitely love this a lot Leslie says
she needs to try the Urban Decay I
program or oily lids eyeshadow creases
bad the other thing is the Too Faced
shadow insurance I found performs for me
exactly the same as the Urban Decay
primer potion it would just be which
packaging in which company you like
better that's my personal experience
with it Tina says she doesn't like the
lorac I primer at all but I've heard
some people on it does work for Angie
says she likes the Urban Decay primer
and Eden which has I believe like a
yellowing kind of tinge to it Yesenia
says she likes the Milani one and
there's really great eye primers from
the drugstore that's a great point
gesenia um so yeah um you said you said
you know that the Milani there's lots of
great drugs for options and we did
drugstore options last week so if you're
curious about some awesome drugstore
options that are just as good as a
high-end ones definitely check out the
chat from West last week Alyssa's Jen
you're not 37 whatever you're doing keep
doing yet better in your late 20s thank
you so much I'm 37 sometimes I think
I've miscounted I'm like I got
yeah 1978 yeah I'm 37 man like how did
that happen I don't know some people
that talking about anti-aging now I get
on know anything about anti-aging it's
like dude yes I do yes I do all right um
Oh Tyler benefit Air Patrol who did I
watch review on she hated oh you know
what was it was um Oh what's her name um
hot and flashy I forget what her real
name is but hot and flashy did a review
on the benefit Air Patrol and she hated
it she said was horrible and if you're
not following if you're um you know
especially if you are my age and older
if you're not following hot and flashy
on YouTube you have to she is fabulous
for that over especially that over 40
makeup lover out there absolutely
amazing um Elena says gin which one
creases the least I can't find one that
is a question for the chat because my
eyeshadows very very rarely crease
sometimes cream shadows will crease on
me but powder eye shadows never crease
on me so Barbara says she graduated in
78 it was a good year um so definitely
if you have oily lids and shadows crease
on you please please please tag do at
Elena a la I n/a and her last name is
wessel w/e ze l can you at her so give
her some angie from hot flashy thank you
give her some advice on primers that do
not crease and do me a favor to those of
you that are in here that are giving
these great suggestions if you take a
moment the chat window disappears after
the chat is over so if you had like a
gem that you shared come back after the
chat is over and put it into the comment
section down below so we don't lose your
we don't lose your great information
there you sent this thing says Jen I bet
you don't spend a lot of time in the Sun
number one beauty secret I used to I
used to when I wasn't up and through
college and then I was like wait a
second I think this is a bad idea and I
stopped spending time aside but anyway
alright so now we need to move on
because it is 10 15 and we're going to
move into foundations and face powders
alright so foundations
is run at you I was going well three
these were than three I was going to
recommend to you guys for higher-end
foundations this is Estee Lauder Double
Wear I use this in the what's on my face
video that went up live today on what's
up in makeup com this is Estee Lauder
Double Wear has been around forever it's
famous for a reason it's absolutely
amazing if you want a more full coverage
foundation highly recommend my shake is
fresco 01 and then also then brand new
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
really really love this a lot my
sister-in-law just bought this she heard
a lot of hype about and I told her how
amazing was so she just bought it she
really likes a lot it's a really really
nice foundation in the packaging is just
gorgeous totally totally worth it and
then this year the hourglass immaculate
liquid powder foundation this is
actually my favorite foundation that
I've ever used I just love the way that
my skin looks after i use it meant
remember please keep in mind that i have
normal skin the double where is is kind
of in between met it's definitely not
dewey but it's not mad either like it's
kind of like a skin looking finish and I
feel like that's what these two really
give you with that skin looking finish
um the the kat von d locket i believe is
more full coverage violetta than the
then estee lauder double wear that was
her question um yo if um KJ if you go to
school if you have a sephora hopefully
help us afford near you go in and ask
them for a sample of the Born This Way
is what I'm hoping that you'll be able
to do but my memory serves me you don't
have a Sephora near you um I wish I
could give you some oh I wish I good um
Oh Michelle I'm so glad that you made it
jenny says she loves the girl on a
lingerie depot and that's her holy grail
high-end foundation and I've heard
wonderful things about that foundation
if I had a million dollars I would go
there is saying it says that make it
forever Ultra HD you was totally worth
the hype we on Sonia was brave enough to
wait in line for that at a generation
beauty I'm very proud of her I did not
wait in line for I wasn't away two hours
for touches my feet were killing me my
foot still pay him for waiting you know
stand around generation beauty I just
couldn't do it so good for you i'm so
glad that you want got it and that you
really liked it
it was worth it you do have us afore
great KJ go and get a sample girlfriend
go when I say hey have them color match
you get a sample and try and see what
you think but yeah I really love the
hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation because I really do feel like
it dries down to a powder finish and I
really like that because it helps me
skip a step everyone's why an amazing
setting powder anyway just because it
feels weird like not having a setting
powder but I love this I wish it was
just a little bit closer to my skin tone
it's not quite my skin tone it's a
little little little this much too dark
so um Shannon says i don't care for a
full coverage either because i don't
want to hide my freckles I love the
Bourjois healthy mix serum nice Shannon
um I you know and honestly like what i
use these i put on like a medium
coverage amount you can build them up to
full coverage you I can still see my
freckles through it so um yes Valerie
says from all-time favorite foundation
is the tart BB tinted moisturizer super
full coverage actually and really
long-lasting nice so if he so if he
wants to know which is better the born
this way or the naked foundation naked
foundation is going to give you a more
sheer coverage so I've heard great
things about the naked foundation I
personally haven't tried it but I know
that this is going to give you more
coverage than that because I've heard
that that definitely is a light to
medium coverage where this is more of a
medium you can build it up close to full
and then Tina says if you're normal to
dry skin the Charlotte Tilbury light
wonder foundation is beautiful see
collect afraid of makeup awesomeness
that's what this is all right so I'm
going to go ahead and put these back and
I'm going to talk about one and I don't
feel like is totally worth the hype
which was the bare skin that bare
minerals bare skin pure brightening
serum foundation I feel like this breaks
up on my skinned are you they and that's
pretty bad for a normal skin person
because I feel like this would break up
on an oily skin person it shouldn't be
breaking up on me you know what I mean
like I get it when you've got wheels on
your skin it would break up a foundation
but I don't know this did not work great
for me I still use it sometimes and I
feel like if i use it with a like I
really make sure I put a good powder
room with it it works but this is not my
favorite it's not my favorite Fort Worth
famous says custom cover drops are her
life right now you know this is the
thing about custom cover drops I got a
sample at sephora and it did not work
because it's not
drop form like I had to figure out how
much to use with my foundation it was
stupid so I think it's one of those
things you just can't get a sample of
you just got to jump in and get it
unless your sample or has like a little
dropper on their nanny says Born This
Way was terrible on her extreme combo
skin both dry and oily areas that is
really good to know thank you so much
for that nanny because I don't have that
so I don't know that so that's really
wonderful Michelle says anyone tried to
you the Y ass all youth fluid it's so so
good that's good to know I don't have
one that's good to know like i know you
know i haven't tried it if anybody's try
to definitely mention that tina says
agree jen on the bare minerals bare skin
i returned it I kept it because I
thought it was going to be okay and it
wasn't beauty haul for 11 says she loves
the viewer air flash foundation but he
uses it only for special events also
sponsors a suspensive um let's see
chelsea says the only high foundation i
tried was the Clinique super balanced
and I really liked it great for dry skin
that's really good to know Krishna says
Jen I feel like with foundations you
really need to get a sample of it you
can ask a hundred girls with their
favorite foundation and you'll get 100
different responses it depends on so
much absolutely because your skin
responds to product differently
depending on how much it sucks up the
product you know moisture wise or you
know it dripping off your skin you know
if you have oily skin i'd totally
totally agree with you but i feel like
there are certain foundations that
seemed to work well for more than just
one skin type that are more versatile
for lots of different skin types and I
feel like definitely the essay loading
Lauder Double Wear I've never heard a
single person say they don't like estee
lauder double wear I challenge anybody
to say they don't like the estee lauder
double wear because I would be shocked
I'd be absolutely shocked so I don't
know I mean unless it's the problem is
that it's too full coverage so Emily and
I already say we like the benefit oxygen
wow it just slid her out it just slid
around even with a primer so you didn't
like it just slid around even with a
primer oh my goodness um you sing it
says Sephora spray dupe for other sports
afore spray is a dupe for the Dior hot
did your air flash that's good to know
you send yeah thank you I mean I do
definitely think um wait a minute I'm
going to confuse I definitely think that
most
foundations are definitely to the
individual person but I do think that
some that some are more likely to work
for more people than others I you know I
traded for this somebody that subscribed
to me on youtube I traded them on Egypt
for this so i traded something i forgot
what i traded for this i didn't pay for
it i gave them use makeup and they gave
me use makeup I know that's weird but it
was pretty much brand new I think she
used it once and she was it wasn't her
skin tone and we ended up trading things
so I didn't pay for it so I honestly
don't know um but anyway two birds okay
anyway alright so it is now 10 23 we
need to move on from foundations health
or powders the only power that I brought
out that I felt like was worth the hype
is the mac mineralized skinfinish I feel
like this is definitely worth the hype I
love this face powder I think it's
awesome I'm really feeling like I
starting to die on me because it's
getting old and I think I need to get a
new one but I really do love this this
powder face powder I love it it's
wonderful do I think that it's so much
better than then drugstore that you need
it no i don't but if you want to buy a
high-end powder this is a good one this
is a good one but i do feel like a lot
of the drugstore powders are just as
good for me and my normal skin the
Rimmel stay matte is a fantastic powder
like I would buy that and this and I
don't know if I'd be able to tell the
difference to be completely honest some
face powders are extremely finely milled
which helps them to kind of blend into
your skin better but I personally
haven't tried a ton of face powder so
that's kind of my least favorite thing
to talk about in the show so i'm not
really i'm sure you guys will have much
better ideas in the chat as far as face
powder but i want to spend it too much
time on face powder um um i don't even
know how to pronounce that art will say
rj says laura geller balance and
brighten evens out my skin without
looking powdery dry skin here and i did
just get that and I am enjoying that
very very much the on the Lord Geller
balance in Brighton Mia said she made a
chat hide me out okay so we're going to
stop on the face powder because we only
have 35 minutes left yeah everyone's
talking about how much they love the
rimmel rimmel stay matte and Tyler
doesn't use face powder girlfriend you
do
do you it's all good don't feel the peer
pressure you give you if it's working
without it then don't use it you do mean
all right let's move on and let's go
into let's see what should we do next
should we do let's stick with the face
and let's do blushes contour bronzer
highlighters um so let's go into blushes
first what did I bring off your blush
the NARS conscience okay I'm gonna get
shot totally gonna get shot face I am
NOT a huge fan of North blushes I'm
really not and maybe it's just the ones
that i have but i don't think they're
worth the hype i have the NARS virtual
domination of help from last year I have
the dual intensity blush and fervor I
returned one of these that I didn't like
at all i knew it wasn't going to use it
but I feel like they take work to put on
they build up but it's like I don't know
man I'm just not I'm not the biggest fan
of NARS blushes I feel like they're
overpriced I don't know like maybe it's
just my skin tone on my skin tight or my
tone or something but I don't enjoy
these like I don't like I like okay I
know that it was great but deep throat I
like I like this one that's the only one
in this palette that I use regularly
Laguna is nice but I wouldn't say like
everybody has to own lagoona or you'll
die you know what I mean like it's a
nice bronzer i mean this is this is a
very famous put one but it's definitely
not for contouring for me I feel like
it's to oranjee for contour for me I
don't know that's why not even showing
up like I can't even get it to swatch on
my skin like and that's not really a
good determination of whether something
works or not whether it's watches on
your skin but it's like there just isn't
enough off to it there is enough pizzazz
the Norse I don't I would not purchase
any more Mars I won't I feel like Mars
as a brand like is not my favorite like
everything i get from NARS I feel like
I'm ending up being let down like I end
up like just like I don't know I don't
know what that is and I feel really bad
because I know a lot of people love NARS
blush um not as an orgasm Tyler said
it's nothing special I have orgasm
too and I don't it's nothing like I said
I mean it's pretty good and then Chris
that says every time I squash them it's
like nothing showing up exactly that's
the way I'm feeling exactly the same
thing Tasha says Oh to shia to she I
think Troy blushes out let me scroll up
because I wanted to see what she said
she said I love to our blushes not sure
about the NARS i only have NARS madly
and I love it okay but that's awesome
i'm glad that that works for you I don't
have that one so i can't speak to that
one chelsea wants to notice anyone have
any recommend recommendations for
blushes for deeper skin tones so at
chelsea jackson for that please please
please ambient blushes the ambient
blushes I got the ambient blush I think
I got a blush yes I got one blush and I
ended up returning because i felt like
it was overpriced for what it was but i
can see why people love them I totally
can see why people love them Nikki to
clinic cheap pop blushes this is the
thing everybody agrees with you Nikki
everybody agrees with you I tried one
and I returned it it wasn't pigmented
enough for me I don't know which one it
was but I got rid of it I didn't like it
and no one agrees with me on this nikki
just don't know that no one agrees with
me everyone agrees with you benefit
blushes are Jenna's favorites um as a
fizzy pop says she loves the cleaning
because they look like flowers I think
he says she loves cola pop I need to try
them again maybe I just got a bum one or
something Betty says good morning Jen
snowing here in Alberta Canada oh my
gosh she likes the urban decay but it's
not her favorite all right let's talk
about some more blushes so did I knock
them out and not blushes here the chart
let's talk about art I love to our
blushes I really really do when I first
start buying tart blushes I wasn't quite
sure because of the building thing also
tart blushes I feel like don't swatch
necessarily very well but man they're
beautiful to build on the chase I got me
this right here that I want to do a
review video on this was from the tart
website and I really really like these
blushes a lot this is one of their
holiday collection for blushes I
personally would recommend this over the
palette that's just me because there's
one shade that doesn't work for you you
could pass it on to a friend and then
just keep the ones that do work for you
also I feel like I'm more likely to
reach for one of these than I am a
pallet that's just me so I really like
the set a lot from Tarte this one is
available now I got this with a gift
hard that tart had given everyone that
got the generation beauty swag bags I
like to put that in there when I don't
pay for something I like to make sure i
tell you i did not pay for this but they
don't know that what I'm telling you
about this they have no idea so is
nothing you doing that but art blushes
are yes definitely let's go ahead let me
see there's any other comments Christmas
says I mean nothing comes off of my
brush I have to build up and build it up
to nothing yes I'm with you Krista I'm
totally with you totally with you KJ
said the set looks nice yeah it is a
really nice set it's very nice all right
um and then mia is saying that she
agrees with the tart blushes and then
Ellen ra says any suggestion on blushes
for fair skin or collection is very
minimal tart blushes really and truly
are really really nice they're very nice
I would recommend the kat von d blushes
but they're now discontinued she's
coming out with the plush duo's if you
haven't seen the show yet she's coming
out with they're like contoured duo's
for blushes cheers to see what that
formula is going to be like but I can't
recommend the kat von d blushes anymore
because in all existing which makes me
super super sad and the bone blushes the
bomb blushes are fabulous you can get
them at kohls holes online or a
hautelook on every three to four months
they're on hautelook they were on in
September so expect them again in
December ish september-october to marry
somebody like December probably December
before the holiday still have the bomb
back on hautelook as what I would have
imagined December or January and then
Angie sang Milani is a good drugstore
blush absolutely and then amy says she
loves her Tarte Amazonian clay blush yes
get it on hautelook because he get a
half price on home look for the bomb who
is that Sierra you have to do it you
have to do it Krista says the Sephora
hombre blush palette is really nice I've
heard great things about the support arm
brave blush palette absolutely um Angie
says she's going to close later to buy
the bone it's really nice I think you're
really going to like it all right let's
get into some highlighters and
contouring stuff that's really important
meetings that so as far as highlighters
if I we recommend any highlighters I
would honestly recommend on the back up
the what is this this formula right here
this formula is the shimmering skin
Perfector pressed I've heard the port is
also nice but I really like the pressed
one is in opal this one is in champagne
pop champagne pop does not last on my
skin but it's beautiful initially if you
don't mind reapplying this I really
really like it a lot um the bomber
always is a 50-percent off-site sale on
cyber monday thank you so much for that
Christos o Krishna says wait till cyber
monday and then go to the bomb com and
get the fifty percent off that is
awesome thank you for us that I forgot
about that but yes I definitely
definitely definitely I do have some
other repairs having Avalanche back
there avalanche I have the liquid ones I
don't like the liquid ones for as much
I'm losing everything not into the trash
not into the Spanish I don't like the
liquid ones quite as much as I like the
the power ones I like the power ones
much much much better and then one thing
I wanted to show you that i'm absolutely
in love with is this one by Oprah now
Oprah is more of like a makeup artist
brands but I'm so in love with this
blush stripes I just had to mention it
just so amazing so amazing like oh my
gosh talk about highlighted for deeper
skin tones like look at this look at
that can you imagine that unlike a super
deep skin tone like how amazing would
that be I keep forgetting to use this on
my eyes I want to use this in I show up
because there's no way this will be a
highlighter on me that would just be a
hot mess on me but just I'd use these
three and i love all three of these oh
oh man isn't totally work that one is
not or that's contour on ax men season
highlights oh here the hourglass ambient
lighting count the original one um
honestly honestly if I were going to
choose between this and the Becca I get
the backup that's just me I look like I
allow the highlighters better than these
I feel like these don't pop as much if
you're looking for a little bit more of
a subtle highlight like if you're at see
if you are looking for a little bit more
of a subtle highlight then you'll
probably like the hourglass better if
you want a pop in highlight you want to
get the backup that's my opinion um I
don't use this as much because I feel
like I can't see it as much I don't know
I like the back of one's better that's
just
that's just me um me and says yes i love
highlighters i love the backup for
highlighters i just got a jack on help
out but i haven't used it yet i think
the colors look weird in that like I
five attracted to that that backup
palette that just came out with a jet
with champagne popping it I'm not
attracted to it for some reason I don't
know why I'm just not Amy says I don't
know if it's good or high-end but I
really enjoy my jewel pilot I enjoy my
jewel apology I can hand out I believe
it's right here but no no highlighting
powder and glow by julep it has some
glitter in it though so I feel like it
gets most of its power from the glitter
but it is very very nice it's a nice
highlight I'm totally with you Angela by
would consider high end for the purposes
of this video Jenny says Jenna's right
regarding subtle but sometimes settles
what you need absolutely Jenny totally
agree totally agree I just personally
prefer a pop and highlight like even for
work I like my highlight to pop I don't
know I like a pop in highlight that's
just a personal preference but so not
everybody likes that though not
everybody likes that fizzy pop says the
Jacqueline palette makes your pores look
huge see that would be a big difference
too because if you have pop &amp;amp; poor's
like you have big pores you don't want
to be glowing like that would the
hourglass probably work much better for
somebody that has um bigger pores
because you don't want your pores be
glowing you know um tabin says the
copper shade me Becca how it can be used
as a blush topper that sounds like a
great idea yeah Mary low Marilyn oh you
can't get through this video without
marilu mary-lou manizer by the bone Mary
Lou's been my Holy Grail forever I'm
Cindy Lou I don't like as much on my
skin tone Sydney lose a little bit more
pinky kind of color I don't like it as
much but just so you know if you don't
want to buy an airy Lou you could also
get lunch money by color pop it's an
exact two bits just a cream formula
instead of the powder formula but it's
an exact do so um you know if you were
looking at that just get this instead
and while you're there get a bunch of
lipsticks to all right it's 1035 I got
to move on the cars for you we're not
going to get through everything ok so
I've mentioned this recently I'm ashamed
I'm ashamed and how much I love these I
feel like contouring powders is one of
those things that might be worth
investing in for high ends there's one
exception with one drugstore exception
but every contouring powder every kind
of bronzer I've ever tried to use for um
oh my gosh I can smell it all the way
over here every time get distracted by
the smell I feel like contouring powder
if you're going to invest in anything
that's high-end and you want to try to
contour you want to learn to contort you
really need to invest in something
that's a little more expensive in my
opinion because I feel like the way that
these perform make it so you can't
really mess it up you know I mean like
and for me who's not a makeup artist I
need something like that I need products
that aren't going to allow me to totally
mess it up this is the burberry earthy
blush and light glow this is a sample
that deluxe I sample that came and it's
burberry box thing that they were
selling at sephora and I'm so thankful
to have this this is the Kevin a quan
and medium both of these are absolutely
phenomenal but here's my big but there's
always a big but always they but if you
don't want to do that the elf contour
palette is pretty much going to give you
the same thing the shade right here um
it's a little bit deeper but this would
be this is this does pretty much the
same thing and kaylee smells my through
my burberry all the way florida totally
agree and and this is the thing is i
don't understand what why it's so
difficult to take a neutral color and
turn it into a contour powder I don't
get why it's so hard like I don't get it
for beginners in contouring exactly
Sierra um and then Kate um Katie Lake
says in my honest opinion nothing
because Kevin the cons contour powder
perfect contour color no red or orange
exactly exactly Annie says she enjoys a
learn Laura Mercier face illuminator
illuminator in indiscretion it's her its
life Sammy says just or the elf palette
on Jen say so I mean it
but I want to get the highlighting 1 i'm
debating about whether i'm gonna get the
highlighting one because i just did a
few orders and i don't know if i can
justify getting it but anyway the
definitely the elf contour palette is
phenomenal it's an exacting for the
smashbox contour palette i have a video
where I swatch everything it's an
executive or contouring I seriously like
I feel like these are phenomenal they're
phenomenal I wish they weren't I wish I
could sit here and say oh my gosh
they're not worth the hype hmm i can
again i'm reading comments now violette
says she has Park Avenue princess from
way back in the day from Tarte i think i
may have to remind away i found it so
dark and i'm not there yeah I didn't
enjoy Park Avenue princess it's orangie
to me I didn't enjoy it I do have it
somewhere in a palette and I don't know
where right now she might be here yep
nope yep right here there's Park Avenue
princess it's like bronze it's bronze
it's definitely not for contouring it's
a bronzer this this would look
ridiculous as a contour in my opinion
it's a it's it's shimmering shimmer all
right content before we move on from
contour I want to talk about to contour
kits I want talk about these two this is
the honest asya contour kit and light
medium and then this is the Kat Von D
shade in line ok ok ok Lake said she had
mentioned the Quan pound it's sold out
online but it's phenomenal $65 you can
find in the stores I've heard great
things about the chemical and contour
palette my friend Lily from Lily
Spurgeon on YouTube she loves the
cabinet the original Kevin tequan
contour palette I know there's a new one
that's supposed to be really good as
well and that it's totally worth it
that's what I've heard nikki says if you
have yellow olive skin Park Avenue
princess is really nice a really nice
bronzer I would imagine that but I think
would be weird for contours because of
the shimmer that's in it alright so if I
had to choose between the two of these
see this is the thing I really would
pick the lorac if I had to choose
between these i would pick the lorac one
and not these that's my opinion I best
up I totally messed up and got the wrong
contour pallets I should have gotten the
rug the lorac one is i swatched in the
store I've heard such amazing things
and I'm crying in my heart that I never
got it but I can't get it because I have
too many stinking contour palettes and I
way to agree the Anastasia one is my
second a second there I'm not the
biggest fan of the Kat Von D shade light
I know that this one's very very popular
but the shades like this one's orangie
this one's more of a bronzer here's your
contour shade this is the only one that
I really use this one's too dark for me
that highlights are really nice like
this is very nice for an under-eye
setting powder I really like it for that
but it's this I don't even know what to
do with this except for use it as an
eyeshadow I mean I'm assuming this is
for deeper skin tones and that's why
it's there and this one I've used as a
highlight but it's really like I feel
like dig in and I feel like it's matt it
just I don't know I don't know I don't
know I know a lot of people love this
that's just a personal thing I mean it's
one of those things okay jay says lorac
colors were orange honored oh no really
well maybe I didn't miss out Valerie
says at sea for me I only have one face
so I don't need an entire palette with a
bunch of contour shades and that's kind
of the way I feel about this one is this
is definitely for deeper skin tones and
that's not gonna work on me and also i
feel like i need a setting spray with
this I've the past couple times I've
mentioned this with friends on YouTube
they said God use it with setting
sprayer also don't go away and I
definitely need to use this for the
setting spray absolutely absolutely
without setting spray the stuff fades
within a couple hours it's gone the
Anastasia what I think performs just a
little bit better but still like get the
elf one is what I'm telling you ten
bucks get the elf one the off one is i
know i know i'm seeing I'm being honest
with you I'm being serious don't have
contour palette again I don't know where
to start a contouring is really not as
bad you just have to use have to
practice is what it comes down to and
learn your face shape you have to learn
your face and how your face works
because everybody's is different and
that's the problem watching tutorials
online for contouring is that
everybody's face shape is different so
what works for somebody like when I
watched like Kathleen lights or
something she's got a heart-shaped face
like it doesn't work for me the way that
she consorts does not work for me so I
had to go to Sephora class to learn that
but I mean the general role as you go
from the top of your ear toward you aim
for
you're like playing pool you know what I
mean like you have to like aim toward
there and then though the closer you get
to your lips the weirder you look so
start at lower like here and then slowly
as you get more comfortable kind of
bring it down a little bit more when you
first start contouring just like contour
to like here and then really just you
want to stop the middle of your eye like
right here I think I'm not even looking
because I can't see myself right now but
like kind of enough and the dimples of
your cheek is where you stop but yes
contouring sometimes worth the hype in
these but I feel like you can get the
elf with these that's my opinion all
right it is 1042 we having backman to I
shadows we have gotten them two
lipsticks we got lots of stuff some we
talked about alright so let's go ahead
oh I meant on my Bobby Brown shimmer
bricks buddy much sugar bricks are
fabulous I got the wrong color I
shouldn't got an apricot but I can't
bear to part with it ever cots really
for deeper skin tones I don't know what
I was thinking almost oh and I want to
have a brow products to I don't know
we're going to get all that let's talk
about eyeshadows next eyeshadow palettes
contouring is faking you're making your
face into an oval you're trying to make
your face or to an oval yeah well you're
trying to get that shadow underneath
your cheekbone to make your cheekbones
pop like so you look thinner you get
that Pompey cheekbone thing going on and
that's why you highlight two is to get
that you um you have to get in tune with
your bone structure absolutely
absolutely I agree and then Helen says
for years they told us not to contour
unless we're being photographs of course
now we're always being photographed
that's a really good point that is such
a good point Helen absolutely all right
let's go ahead and get an eyeshadow i
want to say access are here i start here
with my new baby i love this palette i
love this palette if you are scared of
color I know it looks crazy but if you
want to try color I would recommend this
palette and i'll tell you why these
shades blend so easily into each other
they're really easy to blend like this
is what I look for in an eyeshadow when
I look for an eyeshadow I look for um
that it's pigmented but not
so pigmented that it doesn't move
because some eyeshadows you put them on
and they stick you don't want that
because you want to be able to blend
into the other colors these these bled
really nicely you've also got this
beautiful inner wheel here that helps
you to make them all kind of get
together um these girlfriend girlfriend
amazing um Oh Tabitha we're going to get
into the lorac mega Pro to live got it
right back there we're gonna talk about
in a minute um yes yes yes on this yes
and yes and yes yes um the problem with
a lot of drug store appellants is that
they're difficult to work with they work
but they're not as easy to work with so
I feel like investing in some higher and
eyeshadows maybe something you want to
do if you don't want to fight with a
drugstore palette that's for just a
general that's a very general statement
of course there are specifics that don't
their specific situations where there
are drugs for pallets that wheel were
like high-end shadows but for the most
part I feel like the most drugstore
pallets are difficult to work with
that's me morphy Ashley's talking about
morphy I have a morphing palette coming
in the mail I don't know when it's
getting here I'm hoping on monday i just
got because i couldn't get the 35 or
whatever I just got like a random other
one and then I built my own palette but
anyway let's talk about these since this
was brought up the lorac mega Pro and
then approached him ok I am both I own
this one because I was on my friends
Instagram and she said it was on amazon
and I popped on it and I got it this one
I feel like is totally worth the hype
this thing was amazing it's so fab sold
out it was stupid if you weren't around
buying makeup for this it was the
stupidest launch of a pallet ever like
ever and like they lost so much money
like not producing more of these like I
don't know what the world they were
thinking they need to do a you know mega
Pro Rida redo our edu acts however you
say that word you know what I mean
because this thing is is the most
amazing selection of collars for so many
different skin tones there's so many
looks you can create and it makes me
cry because this isn't available anymore
i'm going to close it up and i'm going
to show you the two is this is the one
that's available for this holiday season
is right here okay with the two and i
talked about this a bit before so if
you're around a lot you've already heard
me save us with the two this is the
thing with the two is that it's a weird
selection of colors the shadows perform
exactly the same but it's a weird
selection of colors violetta so she
returned the mega Pro to God I want the
original mega Pro so bad yeah and this
is the problem with it like why in the
world would you put this is a yellow
tone Matt this is a like a cream Matt
this is a little bit pinky er of a cream
Matt this is a shimmery cream this is a
yellowy I mean what is really the
difference between these two this is a
matte and this isn't and this one you
know they're pretty much the same color
why would you do that why would you do
with that what's wrong with you there's
no taupe in here like which angers me to
no man you have all these choices and
you don't put in a taupe like where's
the neutral transition color like what
is wrong with you lorac for not putting
the taupe in there I who designed this
thing without taupe what's wrong with
you vice force coming up next Angie
we'll talk about that and chocolate bar
palette it's the thing that I would keep
looking at and wanting to get I need to
just suck it up and get it I do you just
suck it up and get it um visi are I've
heard is amazing as well Jenny I've
heard the same thing all right we're off
topic so anyway mega pro two I feel like
this is a good supplemental palette
meaning that if you have already have
like a nice base of eyeshadows and you
want to add to your collection some
really awesome colors exactly Steph
where's the tow man where's the taupe if
you want to add your collection some
really awesome colors I definitely
recommend getting the mega pro two
absolutely but if you only want one
holiday palette this is not it like this
is not for someone that doesn't have a
lot of makeup because it's going to be
annoying to work with that's my opinion
unless you're skilled unless you like
super mad skilled you're gonna have to
post from somewhere else because I don't
see how to use this to make even one
look
by itself without a taupe look I need a
taupe I need it in my life so anyway
that's kind of how i feel about this
busy art is pricey I've never tried it
never tried it oh my gosh like I don't
I'm not gonna say because I'm get myself
in trouble all right now I'm gonna say
all right man emu a got a vis your
palate in like some kind of swag bag oz
watching us fagbag video and he's like
pulling up in could tell he totally has
never even seen it before he's a call
this is a nice pot and he's like he
pulls out another wheezing I got two of
them they give me two of the same
palette and I'm like that's a visitar
palette give it to me man don't don't
don't complain that you got two of them
would give it to me it's amazing like
him oh my gosh like disturb me like no I
understand getting mad about getting to
the same palette but it was a vizio
khalid and every time i seen his yard i
think of that video and how he was so
upset about getting to the exact same
does your palate so cool oh my gosh but
anyway I do love Manny I love Manny in
person Manny in person is such a nice
guy absolutely all right anyway all
right Alexandria hi yes I mixed two
brown J's on top gem for my crease table
that's good to know let me say what are
you talking about Hans Andrea to brown
shades on the top you talk about these
babies up here they're so warm though
they're so warm unless you're warm
challenge I don't know no girlfriend I
don't know if I could pull that off I
can try it I'm gonna try it vice for my
scores coming out all right my school
mice 40 vice 40 voice for mice for I
want to love you I do it's one of those
things where like you ever date a guy
he's like a really nice guy and it's
like man like you're such a nice guy but
there's just something just not there's
just something missing you know what I
mean like he's beautiful he's smart he's
talented in some way but just
something's missing and you're just like
mm-hmm no not really working so that's
the way I feel about the Vice score
that's the way I feel about it I'd want
to get upside down so that the mirror
doesn't glare in your eyes
it's got some beautiful shades but some
of them are not good and some of them oh
and he says I want to cry my vice for
destroyed my life I saw it Annie said
and he like what did you do drop it or
something like stomach and all the pans
fell out like I have a picture of it let
me see I snap a photo of its I couldn't
believe it I had to save it of Annie's
palette let me show you hold on a second
I'm gonna pull it up i'm going to show
you Annie's palette what happened to her
voice for because I think you need to
see this I literally snapped a picture
of it on my phone right here look at
Annie's pilot you see that like what
what it says my jaw dropped so hard I'm
a hahahaha oops or something i started
watching so don't make up junkie 101 was
like let me grab mine I hadn't even
swatch it yet and flipped it to grab the
brush and six of the pans thought in
your hand what's mine have not had that
problem thankfully my soul works mine's
good but you can see how much I've used
it like not I need to use it more I need
to play with it more but yeah exactly
exactly an easy that's how much this is
from the what's up and make up a pie
screencap that to save it in case I
needed it and I'm so glad that I did
because easy access but this is ah
there's some beautiful shades in here
don't get me wrong like I really really
like this one this one's called flame
this one right here I really like that
one a lot but like low leaves like
glitter all over my cheeks by the end of
the day some of them are difficult to
work with like I don't know this is not
one that i would recommend either i'm
going to keep it because i like it
enough to keep it like i like some of
the shades they're fun to play with but
and plus it's beautiful packaging is
beautiful so I'm going to keep it but I
wouldn't recommend this one either yes
Krista says my naked palettes have panza
fall out you know what I have this is my
naked to look that is booty call but
granted I've had this for two years and
it took a year and a half for this one
to start falling out but yes
that worked worth the hype though naked
2 is worth the hype if I can get my
hands on that naked bone I'm getting it
totally get on it totally getting it um

high-end lip product is the two-faced
creme lip my pics I love these things
this one's a naughty new these are my
two favorite shades naughty nude and
pink chocolate are my two favs love
these totally feel like they're worth
the hype I feel like lip products
overall in general for high ends for the
most part are my favorites got an email
about this morning man it was an hour
you guys are killing me dude you're
breaking my heart right now about it
being sold out all right tart rain
forest after dark ribs a great palette
Tina says okay I only try to tart I
shadows from holiday QVC Powell two
years ago did they get better mmm-hmm
not in my opinion all right but anyway
love these love these love these hi my
cutie lipsticks are phenomenal I got
this with you Samuel when we went to the
bite you glad that video should be out
this week that's the shade that I made
and a little bit I love it but I have a
couple other bite Beauty lipsticks and I
love by Beauty lipsticks Urban Decay me
oh my I got this set this is the UM
whatever
what do these call the revolution
lipsticks the island these aren't the
mad ones these are the regular ones the
regular revolution lipsticks this one is
in naked I like that one a lot this one
is an f-bomb it's a really nice bright
shade I like the squirrel huh it doesn't
have a smell so if you don't like smells
this will be a good one um I don't have
I don't ever reach for lip pencils
period this one is called turn on but I
have a bunch of these and I really like
this formula I do like the by beauty and
the Too Faced better though type want to
sound for lipstick to you and me both
girlfriend matte lipsticks I have a few
I have a few more than this but I have a
few mac lipsticks I feel like with mac
lipsticks you have to find the formula
that you like personally I'm a lustre
girl I really like the luster finish
ones I have I had Viva Glam 5 which is a
frost that was by accident I didn't mean
to get this one I traded I don't like
this one I don't like the Frost's I'd
also not a big fan of their mats at all
I don't really like them on the cream
machines I'm not a big fan of I love the
Luster's that's just me personally we're
going to go to into my stairs and Justin
anymore if anybody wants the answer
early that's fine for tart lipsticks
okay tart lipsticks this one I have
recently fall in love with this one is
in Park Avenue princess and I'm really
really loving this it's super super
sheer so if you want like just a really
sheer nuni kind of lipstick this one's
really really good but I don't like
their other lipsticks every other tart
lips like I've ever bought I have not
liked but I really really like this one
jenny says she likes the luster ones too
maybe he says the clinic pop lipsticks
are nice nice to I don't have any of
those Shannon says the cat Mundine
pretty much everything else um but I
find her lipsticks very dry I've never
tried her lipsticks but I will tell you
that the on liquid lipsticks I do like
they are extremely drawing though so you
have to like I keep a lip balm in my
pocket and just apply lip balm over top
which kind of kills some of them at but
I love the colors and i love the staying
power staying power is insane on these
so i really really like these a lot i
did not like the anastasia lip liquid
lipsticks but I've heard that they've
changed their formula and it's better
now but I do not like the ones that i
got from them I like the Kat Von D's
much much better but I don't feel like
these are that much better than the
colour-pop ones i would get the
colour-pop ones over these
that's my opinion I did recently got a
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick and i'm
absolutely in love with it this one is
in the shade Hepburn honey and it smells
smells so good it just smells like
frosting smells amazing just like candy
frosting amazing sugary awesomeness I
haven't ever try to steal a lipstick I
have no idea I know their lip glosses
are very very very very ordinary very
ordinary but that's it firms orders my
lipstick recommendations for high-end I
want to get into mascara since we're
it's eleven o'clock and we're running
out of time thank you very much for
talking to each other about things um
krista says that um audacious lipsticks
are amazing that is good to know for
mascara if I were to recommend any
high-end mascara i would recommend the
Urban Decay perversion I feel like this
one totally lives up to the hype it's
amazing it's fabulous does all those
things in mascaras supposed to do length
and volumizing no flaking no clumping
none of that it's seriously awesome
nikki says honestly I get color pop I
want to get high high-end lip wait I
honestly just the color pop if I want
high-end lipstick I'm 12 want high-end
the myelin which the mid-range are just
meant for me okay sorry took me a second
to read that rusty apple says food candy
lips products are not safe combination
it's not that it has food in it man it
just smells like it I like the way it
smells by the volume Deschanel Valerie
says is her favorite but I real I've
never tried that one but i really really
love this I will say though woman it's
not worth the hype is this new NARS
Bernard this is at the audacious mascara
and Blackman this did not work for me at
all it did absolutely nothing for me I
mean look at this wand it's crazy it's
absolutely crazy like does the little
bristles little rubber bristles or space
so far apart and it just I mean it comes
through my lashes but the formula is not
good to me it's not good to me jenny
says tart lights camera lashes holes or
crow and it's awesome I liked art stuff
like torrid lights camera lashes I think
mascara is kind of like foundation and
that everyone has such different lashes
different things work for them but this
one did not work for me all at all like
I know like it actually made me angry
I know how much this thing costs it's
course it's a walk sample I forget how I
got this I got it with points24 points
or something nikki says she likes the
better than sex and the clinic
high-impact Volume Mascara the better
than sex mascara I felt like it volume
eyes almost too much to the point where
I felt like it was clumping my lashes
together so much it just bothered me but
some people may not bother you know what
I mean Shannon said she hated the NARS
mascara was super wet and clubbed her
lashes horribly um I have the roller
lash I feel like the roller lash for me
with the natural curl that I have in my
lashes was not anything magical it's a
good mascara but it wasn't magical for
me I would not repurchase this
personally but I've heard with people
that really like to hold a curling my
lashes that this works very very well
one thing I also want to show you this
new to me is the it cosmetics mascara I
just got this at generation beauty
really like this one a lot the only
thing about this one is there was one
morning i was getting ready on periscope
and i got some of this in my eye and it
burned my eyes so bad like I must have
gotten a big clump or something in my
eyes I mean I know that's not what
you're supposed to do with it but just
beware if you get this and you actually
get some in your eye hurts really really
really really really bad Liz says I have
to your mascara and I hate it no volume
length at all I got in a hit I got em to
your mascara and I felt the exact same
way about it another thing I wanted to
mention that is worth the hype is a
Lancome CIL's booster XO down mascara
primer this stuff is phenomenal now it
is white though so you want to make sure
that you have a very opaque mascara to
go over top of it or you will be able to
see the white through it so just be
careful with that but it definitely like
you can use this with any mascara you
put it on first and make sure lashes
white it lengthens them volumizes them
you put your black mask over top totally
works totally works it's amazing I've
tried the dior one I don't like that you
are one as much as this one I love this
one it is so amazing so amazing highly
highly highly recommend one thing I
wanted to mention to that's new to me is
this tortoise eyeliner this one I've
been using quite a bit and I've been
practicing with it I love the way it
looks initially I love the way it
applies all of that but I feel like it
flakes off especially if I try to do a
win with it forget it like the wind will
not last like through the day it'll be
gone so it's got it
and minuses if you're not playing on
doing a wing you may really like this
but um if you touch your eyes at all
it's good me going it's going to flick
right off so you know um Gina says she
got the sills loving it at night for a
conditioner oh that's good tonight no k
Lee says little black primer works
doesn't seem to go on but when you add
another layer of whatever on top you can
totally tell it work but it's estee
lauder and not cruelty free I'm let's
say Nellie says I like subversion lash
primer and sir Holy Grail an hour ahead
yes all right let's see before we go was
there anything else that they want to
talk about oh browse some eyebrows a
little bit we talked about brown brown
brown anastasia is known on estancia on
estancia is known for her brow products
let's talk a little bit about those this
one is the dipbrow pomade it's very very
famous if you like Instagram browse this
is great for you um it you Scotty
carefully gotta make sure you spoolie it
out um so you know that's that the brow
powder is also very nice really like
that a lot this one is in brunette dark
brown this one works very very well
filling in my spaces I do not care for
her on the gel what is this was the
Scala clear brow gel smells horrible
smell kills me absolutely kills me and
makes my eyebrows bill crunchy I don't
like that at all I also the UM the I
couldn't find it right before we turn on
the camera but the which caught eyebrow
pencil the brow Wiz the egg is totally
beautiful it's a nice brow pencil but
it's totally totally totally totally one
thing I also wanted to mention as far as
brow products the benefit gimme brow
look at this look at the essence it look
like essence was like dude we can do it
benefit gimme brow um but honestly I
like the essence just as much the only
thing is I have this one is in blonde I
need to get one that's my shade I got
this at generation beauty and I don't
it's the wrong shade but I would do
really like it I feel like it works just
as well as this one I did not like the
Maybelline brow drama look at this thing
unless you have the brows of a giant s
this is not going to be good like look
at that the thing is gigantic I get
product all over my face the Wan kills
it and it smells bad too
so I don't like that one if I were to
get one from the drugstore I would get
the essence one is nice and yes yes
that's one yes um let's say Tina says I
very thick brows I don't have to do much
they clean them up I mainly use the
benefit gimme brow ya better give me
proud does work it's nice but it's got a
nice little brush it's nice but it
doesn't fill in my spaces like I have
spaces like you can see my browser
pretty scarce so I need a pencil or
powder if the lows in and then this
would be like a topper on top tabatha
says steal his own hot look yeah that's
exciting of the check that as soon as we
sign off nikki says I can't remember the
Alpha I'm talking about but it's a white
wine or tube okay oh no um but anyway I
don't owe you love the crunchy wait to
charlatan I don't know what your real
name is I'm assuming it's not to tarla
10 but I don't like crunchy browse it
bothers me all day I'm like this like
crunchy hair like what men have the
crunchy hair like I can't even see a new
ecstatic so anyway Oh eyeliner meeting
talk about eyeliner with all these
things being talked about its 1107 I
gotta get going but I wanted to talk to
you guys about eyeliner the liquid
eyeliners the Stila stay all day is a
really good option also the Kat Von D
tattoo liner and troopers also really
good option but if you want to get a
drugstore option the Jessie's Girl
eyeliner I always talk about all the
time it's amazing Jessie's Girl
cosmetics calm I think it's like 10
bucks totally totally just as good as
the steel and the kat von d so I
wouldn't I wouldn't get these I would
get the the Jessie's Girl one absolutely
and you get more product I think to the
egg cosmetics brow powder I didn't
mention this one either this one is
really not getting any honest on ze one
this one a lot I feel like it's pretty
much the same i think it's a little bit
cheaper for eyeliner pencils i honestly
don't like the Urban Decay glide on eye
pencil as they dripped down my waterline
and get messy so I honestly I would
prefer these see the Sephora ones are
fantastic they're amazing also the ah
mr. right now is from the book are also
amazing these are also a little bit more
expensive the support ones probably the
cheapest out of all of them let's see
I'm going to read some of the things
lezzies talking about Annette says the
starlix pen liner is
some o Tabitha's here there's another
Tabitha um let's see on a minute Maddie
says yes it is still liquid eyeliner oh
my god I still going so fast jenny says
Marc Marc Jacobs eyeliner I'm Katie says
hourglass has a great brow pencil and
then Tina says lorac front of the pro
liner front of the pro liner oh ok
picked up the Jessie's Girl and can't
wait to give it a try let me know what
you think Tina um KJ says eyeliner
inglot only for me nothing else stays on
for you I got this at the gel one I got
the gel one it was ok for me it was ok
it didn't blow me away but that's just
me like you know doesn't mean you know
um everyone saying they love the Jesse's
girl my lab is looking for the darker
really it's not dark enough how oh my
goodness everyone's saying the Marc
Jacobs ones are amazing that's good to
know good morning Boston Barbie doll it
cosmetics brow liner is great according
to Ben and rentals around the clock
didn't run in the water line that's very
good to know fantastic so that I covered
everything that I wanted to cover a lot
of other things that I didn't get to
what the one top of the giorgio armani's
eyes to kill and i got these from my
friend Lily she sent these to me and I
do really like these but I don't think
that they're that much better than the
Loreal infallible I would say get the
Loreal infallible unless you can't find
a dupe shade and you really want to
travel on the eyes to kill but the the
infallible czar just as good in my
opinion but I pretty much talked about
everything I want to talk about and it's
11 10 I gotta get going I'm gonna try to
