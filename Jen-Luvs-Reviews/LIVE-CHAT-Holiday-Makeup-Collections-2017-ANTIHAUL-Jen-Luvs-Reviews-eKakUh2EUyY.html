the what - the makeup live chat it is so
good to be here with you and the
collective bringing of makeup
awesomeness and we are going to collect
and bring it out today with an anti haul
what what not gonna Baja that was not
kimberly-clark worthy at all if you are
not subscribed to kimberly clark you
need to go over and subscribe to her
right now she is amazing she is the one
she is the one who is the inspiration
for anti hauls all over YouTube at least
that's what I believe I guess other
people could have inspired each other at
this point but Kimberly Clark started at
all so definitely make sure you
subscribe to her she is phenomenal and
I'm proud to be acquaintances with
Kimberly so I wouldn't say we're best
buddies but I wish we were I wish we
were closer friends but we have
connected mutual respect and awesomeness
between me and Kimberly so anyway enough
about me
droppin names and how I'm so proud that
I've spoken with her off of youtube
let's go ahead and jump into it actually
no I can't jump into the anti halt
because we have to stay on low to the
collective brain because I want to get
their opinion on what they don't want to
buy too so we're gonna go and say hi to
them and then what I've done is I have
gone on my phone and I have made
shopping carts both at Ulta and Sephora
of things I'm not going to buy last time
I did an anti haul I think there was at
least one thing that I did end up buying
that I said I wasn't going to buy so
this is never an absolute but this is
what I plan on not buying so I've got
carts up here and then I would love to
hear what the people who were here in
live chat had to say about those items
and if you're watching this on the
replay I would love to know what you
think in the comments down below so
let's go ahead and say hello very
quickly because when I invite people
into my home I like to take a moment to
say hi so let's say hello to the first
people that are here AJ is here happy
Sunday all relaxing with mulled wine my
butch made a perfect fall day uh uh
sounds wonderful Steph is here are
wonderful moderator hello Steph
christina is here she's been waiting for
this all day love the live chat thank
you so much Christina Judith is
hello to you hello to Tam hello to
Shirley she likes my thumbnail Thank You
Shirley hello to Aspen yay anti Hollen
Chet I'm on a no buy so hoping get
kimberly-clark inspiration to keep me
from buying yeah that's the goal for
today hello my friend Valerie and the
net and Nicole from yeah your name
Nicole so good to see you here she's
over on the west coast so it's great to
have her people here from the west coast
because usually it's early and people
from the west coast is just too stinkin
early lisa is here good morning good
morning I'm saying good morning good an
evening to you or good afternoon
wherever you happen to be Oh Tabitha is
here from which mom Davis hello hello
Ali is here and Tabitha nerdling phul is
here as well TJ and kelsey and bella boo
pixie is in the house
if I didn't say hello to you hello to
you and welcome so this is what we're
gonna do we're gonna go to my Ulta cart
first and let's talk about some things
some products that came out if you do
not watch my make up new show what's up
and make up then you you might not know
the amount of product that's coming out
right now it's kind of overwhelming
especially October is the month when all
of the holiday stuff comes out it seems
to be slowing just a little bit and it
should slow at this point I think we've
hit the peak in those first few weeks of
October as far as the holiday releases
and when it shouldn't be a steady
trickle until mid-november of these
holiday gift sets and things like that
Oh before I do that no you know what no
I'm gonna reconsider I was gonna go
ahead and through and tell you some
things that I was planning on reviewing
cuz I do have basically what's happening
now is I have pretty much everything
that I'm gonna review at least through
November already set up so I really
don't want to buy a whole lot right now
so this it's kind of you know
inspirational in that that oh no it says
my bag is empty oh no no it says I'm not
signed in mmm Ulta hold on a minute
really it signed me out and I even have
stay signed and clicked technical
difficulties please stand by not gmail
con
komm okay what's my Ulta password I've
tried to change my Ulta password like
nine times because I keep forgetting
what it is
there we go I'm signed in now let me see
it still says my bag is empty are you
kidding me I spent like half an hour
filling up this bag and it's gone I'm so
not happy right now okay well this is
what we're gonna do because Ulta is much
easier to use than Sephora we should be
able to go to the new releases new
arrivals and we'll just go we're just
going to kind of flip through so the
first thing that I'm seeing here is the
lorac mega pro 4 and I have been on the
fence on the fence about getting this
because I do own the other three and
Emily Noelle 83 who is also a very liked
acquaintance of mine we spoken offline
just very very few times she loved it
she absolutely loved it and I've had
lots of requests to review it but I
really don't think I can review it in
the timely manner and I think that's the
only reason why I'm not getting it is I
just don't I don't have time for it I
don't have time to use it I don't have
time to enjoy it and I just feel like it
would be a waste for me to buy this even
though I've heard wonderful wonderful
things about it I'm gonna go ahead and
scroll down and see if there's anybody
talking about this stuff Tony says the
mega pro 4 is pretty amazing let's sing
Alijah already got it
jessica says not getting the mega pro 4
it is on sale at these not to encourage
you to buy it but it is on sale at the
Ulta website for forty four dollars and
twenty-five cents mark down from $59
yeah mommy where's paint where's war
paint says Emily Noel made me want this
and me too I am totally with you I
almost bought it just because of her
review and I held off and I don't think
I'm gonna get it I don't think I'm gonna
get it Shan says I'm not getting a mega
pro 4 because the three owns my heart
the three is good I really love my mega
Pro palette it's just if it's if I can't
review it I'm not gonna get it because
there's no point I have at this point I
am 100% like only buying things
well not 100% 90% only buying things
just to review on the channel because I
have an overload like I if you could see
the floor around me like it's read
Kilis like those of you that are neat
freaks would freak out like at the mess
and clutter that's behind me because I
just haven't had time to organize things
so yeah so I'm not going to buy that
next on the list is the prism palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills I'm actually
testing that for review I'm really
really hoping that I can have that
review up to you before I leave for the
west coast on Friday morning I'm leaving
it like oh my like 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning for my house Friday morning but
I'm hoping to be able to get that review
up for you before I leave
alright the next thing on here I'm just
going to there new releases is the tarte
magic star palette i am not gonna buy
this it looks like this and i actually
already purchased it's right here let me
see if i can grab it hold on oh I got it
I got it
I already purchased this and this I
would really love to do a full review on
because I think it's totally worthy of
it because I find it to be a wonderful
gift I used it today for my eyes and my
lips except for I did add something onto
my lips on top of this but this is the
tarte holiday palette i think this one
is only at sephora i believe but this
this is a great gift for people that
don't have a big collection if you
already have a big collection this is
going to be super repetitive and you
don't need it but like this would be a
great way for my mom to Rio pon makeup
it does have that vanilla scent coming
off of it right now I can totally smell
it but you've got a really nice mix of
shimmers and mattes in here that's what
I have on my eyes today I'm wearing this
blush today I'm wearing this highlight
today I think I used this bronzer as an
eyeshadow as part of my show this one
has some shimmer in it this one is matte
both of these are matte this is a
shimmer and then inside here you have a
mirror you have a lights camera lashes
mascara that's what I'm wearing today I
forgot how much I like this mascara it's
actually very good and then this is the
tardis lip paint in that is what I have
with my lips but I have my lorac gloss
over top of it my pirate gloss that I
love this one doesn't even have a name
on it it doesn't have a name on it I
don't know what shade it is well that's
a bummer
and then it's got an eyeliner and this
is the eyeliner I'm wearing today - this
is the sex kitten liner and actually
enjoyed using this I'm not a big pencil
liner person but I actually really
enjoyed using it so this is
definitely gonna be if I do end up fully
reviewing it this is definitely gonna be
a recommend for gifting purposes to
people with very small collections
people that or if you're just the chart
collector I'm really I really love it
it's it's really great so far I've used
it three or four times this I think the
fourth time I've used it and I've been
enjoying it but because there's no way
I'm buying this like that's kind of
that'd be crazy I'm not buying that this
doesn't look this practical either where
this will be good like again if you
don't have a big collection and you just
want to put it out
you know in your bathroom and you've got
this and you just put it up and then
you're done you've got like your whole
kit here for everything you need Sarah
says Tarte Holly palettes are really
bulky but cute I agree oh I totally
agree Paula says I love Tarte I left
hearts super good products super good
promotions and international shipping I
have grown to really like tart
eyeshadows there was a while I did not
like them I didn't like the original
Tarte lip palette but I they're growing
on me I'm starting to really like them
Oh Kristen is here Kristen from Kristin
game is here hello my friends Chris and
I will call a friend she is amazing if
you not subscribe to Kristin's channel
you totally should Kristin GE hm Kri STI
and not en like I did when I first met
her alright here's the next thing I'm
not gonna buy it
honest ah see Beverly Hills sugar glow
kit and I'm not gonna buy it I have so
many highlighters at this point I have
almost an entire drawer full of highly
refined um stuff like this not that this
is dumb in that the shades are bad or
that you know there's anything wrong
with it but I feel like this looks like
every other globe kit that's out there I
mean maybe there might be some slight
shifts that are different in the shades
but it's like really it's almost like
blushes how many blushes do we need how
many highlighters do we really need i
get beyond my shadow obsession i get the
lipstick obsession but to have like you
know fifty different shades of
highlighter like that's just something i
can't wrap my brain around and its no
hate to people that can they do love
highlighter and love to have 50 shades
of highlighter maybe it's just my skin
tone I don't need it maybe that's it I
don't know but if they didn't have so
much highlighter I might consider it but
I'm just I'm swimming in highlighter I'm
just swimming in it Tony says I want
this year
but only because I've never owned an
aviation locket or highlighter and Tony
I would definitely recommend trying it
then because I do have some honest eyes
you know I've won on a Stadio glow kit I
think it was the first one they came out
with and I really really love it a lot
it's a great highlighter I would
recommend that formula over the Bekaa
just because it it lasts longer on me I
find the Bekaa to be a bit creamier but
the lasting power is not as good for me
as the Anastasio one that's just my
personal preference okay so let's go to
the next thing the next thing on here is
the pretty little planner by Too Faced
which I also purchased already it looks
like this that's the other holiday
palette that I'm planning on reviewing
this one so far unless you really really
like the planner unless you're buying
into the like the planner part of it I
would say you could probably skip it for
the eyeshadows there's nothing
outstanding in there it's again a nice
gift for the right person that would
like the planner with the shadow palette
but you know it's just nothing out you
know a makeup junkie doesn't need that
you know unless you like the planner
that's just that's my opinion so far I
think I've used it twice only though but
both times you know my eye look came out
fine it was fine but nothing that I
would say oh my gosh you have to go get
okay this one I'm on the fence about I'm
not sure if I want this or not this is
the Urban Decay all the stuff is
eyeshadow it's so weird the Urban Decay
new metals palette I'm on the I'm on the
fence on that one I think I want to put
my fingers in it that's what I'm
thinking I want to touch it I want to
feel it I want to rub it I want to see
what the deal is with it and then I will
decide because I'm really on the fence
miss one because I'm hoping this is a
new formula from Urban Decay
I doubt that it completely is but no no
I don't know I don't know oh let's see
some fish out of water hello my friend
I've never jumped on the hallow kits
because I'm so fair so there's never
more than one maybe two shades it'll
work for me I'm considering this one but
I want to swatch to see if I could
perhaps use yeah I understand I totally
understand Tabitha Tabitha which mom
Davis says I don't I don't like the Too
Faced holiday sets by the way happy Sawa
nerely I believe you celebrates Ellen
Mercedes who made that I don't like the
way it's put together this are you talk
about this one right here this is the
Urban Decay new heavy metal palette is
what it's called it's called the heavy
metals metallic eyeshadow palette it's
$55 I'm on the fence on this one I'm not
sure I'm not sure not gonna get the
chart magic star set because I already
bought this and I think that this is a
fantastic thing for me to review this
will probably don't tell my mother but
this will probably end up going to her
at some point because I think that she
would really love this
Jessica says I love watching your videos
thank you so much
AJ says i swatched the Urban Decay
metals it was nice very cool was it at
Ulta okay oh my goodness kitty
celebrates Allen happy soin my daughter
is is Wiccan if you don't know this
might my 9 year old so we celebrate
although Wiccan holidays so I know you
know we know when all of them are so
we're prepping for salad she's inviting
a friend over this year which is very
very different so I'm thankful that her
parents are open to a celebrating
someone with her I think that's pretty
cool because my daughter is very very
excited about having a friend over for
it alright next thing is the Too Faced
we're totally off topic the Too Faced
best year ever
palette set this reminds me so much of
the cafe palette set that they had last
year it looks like this you get three
palettes that cafe palette set was not
good last year as far as the quality it
smelled very interesting but the quality
was not good so I have no interest in
even trying this I'm not going to I'm
not going to even try it this year I'm
letting it go it's just not worth it
Claudette said she loves my sweater
thank you so much my husband bought this
for me because I needed a sweater for
pictures for today that matched the rest
of the family so that's why I have the
sweater but yeah thank you so much you
know it's so funny what did somebody say
about my Oh someone had mentioned
watching a live chat is almost like
trying to have a conversation with
somebody that won't get off the phone
because I go off topic a lot if that
bothers you I'm really sorry
I just you know I'm not gonna be anybody
but me and that's that's what I do so
I'm sorry if you don't like it I have
lots of other stuff on the jail I've
nine other videos that you can
watch that aren't like this it's good
but anyway yeah I'm not gonna buy that
back on topic gia says what about the
tart toasted palette oh right now it's
gonna be a pass for me
the tartlet toasted right now I recently
there's a conversation on our Facebook
group going on about the Charlet toasted
there were a couple of reviews release
that that it's very powdery just at
first glance watching one of those
videos for about how much of her review
did I watch the channel is called Kiki
channel she has a hundred and nine
thousand subscribers and it's called
emergency review tartlet toasted palette
terrible I watched the first five
minutes of it it really doesn't look
that terrible to me but I haven't
watched it with like my review eyes on
completely so I'm not going to judge it
yet but it really doesn't seem like it's
that bad but I definitely want to look
in more to it but I'm probably not gonna
buy it anyway just because I don't have
time to review it if I had time to
review it I would get it
Lisa says my skin looks great thank you
so much I appreciate that
alright let me just move on okay I could
I could go off topic again but in
Mechelen I mean its focus focus Jen okay
next is the snowball mini lipstick set
by Mac and I'm not gonna buy that either
it looks like this I'm not gonna buy
anything from the Mac snowball
collection I actually went to the Mac
website and I put some things in my cart
and then I closed the window but I am
NOT gonna buy it I don't need it I don't
have time to review it it's just it's
beautiful like this is not a good
representation of the packaging of the
snowball collection it's stinking
beautiful like they did a wonderful job
with the packaging for it and it's so
pretty and I really thought about
getting it but I'm not going to buy it
because I don't I can't review it
there's there's no point I shouldn't I
shouldn't own something I can't review I
do overall like MAC lipsticks I don't
think they're not my favorite lipsticks
but I do like them I like them better
than their lip glasses I don't like the
lip glass formula at all I don't prefer
that thick sticky heavy gloss feeling
it's not it's not what I prefer
but the lipsticks I do like it's seventy
dollars and you get how many
up sticks do you get it doesn't even say
hold on a minute
mm-hmm doesn't even say do I literally
physically have to count these 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 lipsticks it looks like
for $70 but they're minis so yeah that's
a lot I feel like that's a lot that's a
lot $70 for 12 lives I see now I have to
get out my calculator and divide that 70
divided by 12 is like 6 bucks a lipstick
for a mini man especially if I'm not
gonna wear all the shades ok this was
something I was going to buy but I'm not
gonna buy it now this is the unicorn
survival kit by two-faced I was going to
buy this and then I ended up buying a
full-size of the unicorn tears the late
melted latex of the unicorn tears I
already have the unicorn tears lipstick
that I love first impression of the
melted latex is I like it
I need to play with it more I really
wanted the highlighter and then I
realized I didn't really need the
highlighter because seriously am I gonna
wear it I mean I bought a couple of the
rainbow highlighters am I ever really
gonna wear those really Jen like what
were you thinking you're never gonna
wear that it's never so there's no point
so there's no point me getting an
iridescent highlighter I'm never going
to wear it I bought the milk makeup
you're a doesn't highlighter stick thing
I haven't worn it once not once because
it's an iridescent highlighter Wow what
were they good were they thinking if you
have a good use for the unicorn
highlighter right milk makeup I would
love to know what you use 1/4 you use it
for anything besides the UM besides as a
highlight like you if you ever use it on
your eyes I've never tried that Shan
says passing on the unicorns yeah
unicorns I seem like they're kind of
like what can we get past the unicorns
we've been we've been there for a while
can you buy the unicorn set at Sephora I
don't know I don't think so though I
think it's only at Ulta it might be a
two-face website though all right next
up let's spend 30 minutes at Ulta and
then we'll spend 30 minutes at Sephora
that sounds good okay so now we've got
the steel of star studded eight stay all
day liquid lipstick set not gonna buy
not gonna buy it no I don't like stealer
liquid lipsticks at all their morning my
least favorite formulas of all time of
the liquid lipsticks I like their lip
glosses are fine and I liked some of
their eyeshadows before but their lip
liquid lipsticks are very drying for me
very drying they crack
they don't wear well they're one of my
least favorite formulas liquid lipstick
ever I know there are people that will
disagree with me on that but I really
don't like them at all at all Blue Ivy
wants a review on milk makeup I have a
few select things from milk makeup but I
haven't tried a lot from them I don't
know if I have enough hello to a Rio Rio
de Janeiro I was supposed to go there
this past summer didn't end up making it
yeah I would I would like to I don't
know if I have enough from milk makeup
to do a full review on them maybe one
day maybe one day I'll keep it in mind
black diamonds in process I hate steel
as liquid lipsticks I am so with you
we're for rose pieces I just bought for
Santa and eyeshadow and lipsticks I hope
you love them that's awesome
Blue Ivy I got you review on milk makeup
I will try maybe one day not anytime
soon I don't have enough I'd have to
purchase a lot more and then I'd have to
try a lot more all right this is the
bluffs Bluffs blush bliss blush palette
by tarte their holiday blush palette not
gonna buy I don't need it I still have
my blush palette from like two years ago
how many times have I used it maybe 10
or 15 from two years ago and these
shades are really bright I feel like
this this might not be good for my skin
tone they're really bright and I guess
you could use a light hand with it but
the shades aren't calling to me I give
him credit for being a little different
but alright here's another thing I'm not
gonna buy I'm not gonna buy any of this
stuff this is the Smashbox drawn in
decked out shadow and highlight palette
set alright looks like this not gonna
buy it I did not like the Smashbox the
shot was it cover shot I think it was
they were calling eyeshadow palettes I
got two of them I returned them both
I have a full review on them did not
like them but they were awful to be
completely honest with you the two that
I got I got a smoky one and I got
another one the smoky one they just all
turned black like they you blended them
and it's like I'll turn black it's like
I understand it supposed to be smoky but
I'm not supposed to look like I just
came out of a fire you know like it just
everything I did like I blend it and
just all turned black and then the other
one just wasn't pigmented enough I
remember right the contour kit in here I
actually really liked the Smashbox
contour kit I know that's a highlight
let me see
three highlight shades okay so it's not
so all I would be would be the
highlighter palette so no nope nope nope
so this set of palettes brings you three
highlight shades and sixteen on trend i
shadow shades it's everything you need
to create makeup looks that range from
holiday parties to everyday chic yeah it
says cover shot palette said oh you get
the ablaze palette which I did not try
and the sultry palette which I did not
try so it's two of the cover shot
palettes that I didn't try but still I
have no interest in that man I'm not
getting any of this it's like everything
noot noot noot noot noot noot knew all
these new arrivals nope nope nope okay
Beca apres-ski glow collection glow face
palette just like I was saying with the
last highlight palette no nope no no no
no no it's pretty though packaging is
beautiful if I wasn't overloaded in this
kind of stuff I would definitely
consider this it's very pretty
it's gorgeous they nailed the packaging
on this it's really pretty but I'm not
gonna buy it
bancini says I bought that set and I
liked it the Smashbox mono oh good oh
I'm so glad marinella says Smashbox
should sell those palettes separately if
you don't need everything they they do
sell the cover shot palettes I don't
know about the highlight palette but the
cover shop towels they do sell
separately Aspin says I have nothing
from Smashbox just haven't seen anything
I can't live without their contour POW
it's really good
I really like their contour palette but
the elf one is an exact dupe it's just
the lasting power isn't quite as good as
the Smashbox but it is a great contour
palette at least I find it to be great
for my skin tone I don't know about
other skin tones and a hi anna anna says
i need to stop buying highlighters and
highlighter palettes i'm so with you
so if you
Aspen's says that a priests key
packaging is killer I totally agree
Allison says what smashbox is one brand
i haven't tried yet yeah i mean i see
them getting more into the influencer
market they had that trip where they
took a bunch of influencers and they all
had smashbox stuff so i know they're
trying to get more out there into like
youtube and everything but I honestly
haven't found much that I like from
Smashbox their eyeshadows I really don't
enjoy like I said I like the contour kit
but I can't think of anything else I've
tried that I've been like yes go
Smashbox you know just not oh the
Smashbox primer the face primer is nice
if you like a silicon based primer it's
very nice okay let's go to the next one
urban decay little liquid vices I
actually like the urban decay liquid
little liquid lipstick formula I only
have one I can't tell you what shade it
is I only have one but I do like it but
do I need these no but I do like it it's
it's not super drying on me I've heard
on other people it flakes I haven't
personally had that problem but you know
if I didn't already have a ton of
lipsticks I might get that maybe it's
$28 though for four of them that's
really expensive I feel like for little
for little guys like that I don't know
what is that 28 divided by four can I do
my math ever since I stopped teaching I
can't do math anymore for eight twelve
sixteen 24 so like six seven dollars a
piece I guess it's fair ish man okay Oh
for cosmetics only holiday globe auto
only offer cosmetics online only holiday
glow palette I haven't tried over
eyeshadows I love their highlighters
love their highlighters I've never tried
a contour powder from them that might be
a contour powder but there's nothing
magical in here I own a lot of over
highlighters I really enjoy them so that
would be the only thing in here that
would make me go yes I need this in my
life I did forty nine dollars seems to
be a very reasonable price for that
because I know they came out with that
highlighter palette it was like one
hundred and twenty five dollars or
something like that for all the
highlighters but this seems this is only
forty nine which seems pretty reasonable
but I don't know yeah I'm not gonna buy
it okay I'm not buying anything I'm done
oh this is when I specifically want to
talk about I'm gonna skip down a little
bit
these buxom sets and I bucks on these
benefit sets what is up with benefit
okay benefit you're watching this
benefit what is up with all of the same
products repackaged in like 30 different
packages throughout the year it's insane
it's insane
I mean they must be selling they must be
selling or else you wouldn't do it but
what what is this what is this it's a
it's a bra it's a hula bronzer it's a
professional and it's a dare real
mascara and they've got a ton of these
little sets that they're just the same
products over and over and over and over
captain however lease is something new
give me something new come on product
development what is happening in your
product development department I'll help
you hire me I'll help you I'll help you
develop products I got lots of ideas up
here but this repeat over and over and
over the same thing how about coming out
with some bronzers that are good for
deep skin tone how about that let's do
that yeah I like some really good
highlighters how would be awesome it fit
so the same things over and over and
over and over again driving me bonkers
all right here's another one Benefit
Cosmetics beauty and the bay or they're
all about San Francisco I believe it's
the same oh no it's not the same this
one has a bronzer a mascara a high brow
pencil which is actually really good and
the high beam little mini high beam that
looks like that I mean the benefit
packaging is gorgeous who is that just
that the benefit packaging is gorgeous
Adriana Adriana I totally agree with you
I like benefit packaging but they got to
stop releasing the same things over and
over again I mean they like I don't get
how they're still selling these same
products over and over and over again
all right here's something new this is
the it cosmetics it girl limited edition
palette looks like this it's very pretty
looks like fat this would be another
thing that I think might be a nice gift
for like my mother
that might be good it's just it looks
like it's just a bunch of neutrals with
a blush in it I didn't hear good things
about the superhero eyeshadows though
and it says that it's got the superhero
eye foundation so I guess it's like
basis and then you put the shadows over
top so that's kind of cool I like that
they're trying to get creative that's
cool but I don't know I I just I don't I
don't need that I'll need that in my
life
okay here we go here's another thing
steal a mermaid magnificent metals
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadow
collection girlfriend or boyfriend
I want these so bad I need I like these
are sold out at Sephora if you're
looking for them they're at Ulta they
have they're the ones that we that I
personally have been waiting for this is
a phenomenal formula if you like glitter
on your eyes these Stila Magnificent
metals are amazing and they have them at
Ulta right now there's three different
ones there's like a purple one a blue
one and like a blue pink blue pink one
I've been waiting for this forever but
they're $24 each
I might get one so aunts I hold the
other two I think I might get this one
the first one I showed you this one
right here this pinky one I might get
that one cuz that that formula is money
it's so good it's so good oh my gosh
Oh saucer jess is here I didn't know if
she was here she always leaves me a
little purple hearts okay cover FX
perfect highlighting palette same thing
same thing we're getting so repetitive
here butter LONDON I want to talk to you
about butter LONDON
you tried butter lemon makeup I haven't
tried butter LONDON makeup there's their
holiday stuff this is called Majesties
medals for peace glaze and eye gloss
collection you guys tried this stuff
because I know nothing about this
i I've only ever tried butter lemon nail
polishes and I was not super impressed
with them so I'm curious about this
stuff I'd love to know what you guys
what you guys think Melissa wants to
know what base for the Stila do you need
glitter glue nope you don't need
anything it is magical you need
nothing it is so good actually I think I
have all look at this in my mess I have
one right here I will show you
girlfriend or boyfriend okay this one is
my newest one this is called diamond
dust it's supposed to be an anti hole
and I'm getting able to spend money this
look at the opacity stuff is sick and
you don't need a glitter glue it will be
like this and it will stay like this and
it stays on my eyes at least for me I
don't need a glitter glue it just looks
like this it's amazing I love it I love
it it does transfer some no that's my
biggest complaint is if you have hooded
eyes you probably it'll probably
transfer pretty bad that's my only thing
I've kidding karma to stuff that's a
really good one and then I have the
ballet ballet baby I think is what it's
called but I lose my breath with these
things they're so awesome they're
awesome
alright let's go ahead and head over to
Sephora and check out their offerings
over there by the way I did do an AWS
tips for shopping at Ulta video and then
tomorrow is gonna be my tips for
shopping at Sephora and I already filmed
it I filmed it today and it's a good one
and I have my car here yes okay
I got to get this off my wrist before I
make a mess everywhere I have a brand
new washcloth down here making a bigger
mess okay my cart saved at Sephora so
I'm very thankful because it's harder to
find things at Sephora okay first thing
we need to talk about the Sephora
everyday must haves kit it looks like
this
these Sephora every a must have kits are
amazing you get the best deals where you
can try so much stuff for such a little
little cost so it's a two hundred $24
value and it's $75 and if you like these
products if you're interested in trying
these products I would highly recommend
looking into this but this is why
I'm not going to buy it let's see what
it contains so it has an Anasazi ax
Beverly Hills brow Wiz and medium brown
that's too light for me and I've already
tried the Anastasio brow Wiz Beauty
Blender original Beauty Blender I
already have a Beauty Blender it's fine
I don't need another one benefit hoola
bronzer I already have it don't need it
Bobby Brown long-wear cream shadow stick
and golden pink I've never tried that
that might be fun to try so that's a
good one
Kat Von D Beauty locket setting powder
again never tried that so that's two
things that I'd be interested in trying
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD microfinish
loose powder I haven't tried that either
but it doesn't excite me like the loose
powders in there don't excite me Marc
Jacobs highlighter gel eye crayon and
blacker I've tried that it's fine not
excited NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil and
Koo Ella not excited about that Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer how many
of us I would be very curious to know
how many people have not tried that
primer in a sample that's been given to
them at Sephora Alta or something
because everywhere okay everywhere so
nobody no nobody needs that okay maybe
somebody needs I shouldn't say nobody
because I'm sure somebody needs it but
definitely not me okay Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara I just got a
sample my Tarte set so no they're too
faced melted matte liquefied long wear
lipstick and sell out what does that
look like I'll have to look at the shade
but I've tried that formula before and I
do like it it's not my favorite but I do
really like it so maybe that's a four
things in here Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray I don't do setting sprays
I don't do spray on my face and the YSL
Touche Claud radiant touch into luminous
ivory I do own one of those they're fine
they're not amazing so that's four
sample sized products in here of things
that I will actually be interested in
using two of them are face powders I am
not paying $75 for four prod for sample
size products and two of them are face
powders so there's no reason why I
should get this and that's kind of the
way that I look at these is you've got
to not look at oh my gosh this is the
great value oh my gosh I'm getting so
much stuff and then just buy it like
really legit look at each item and be
like am I really gonna use this is this
something I really
really want to try because if you can't
find $75 for the stuff in there
there's no point there's no point don't
do it so that's something I'm not gonna
get is there another one in here no okay
so the next thing is the Kota Beauty
desert dusk eyeshadow palette nothing
against hooda nothing against this
palette but I don't have time to review
this I just don't have time I've gotten
a lot of requests to review it I don't
have time I can't get it up in a timely
way I still have the the Lila the lila
palette or Lila however she wants to
pronounce it I would pronounce it Lila
cuz that's my kids name but I've got
them Tasha know Lila palette I've got
the prism palette 2 review I've got you
know the two holiday palettes to review
I I don't I can't I can't review this I
don't I don't have time so I'm gonna
pass on it I've heard that it's better
than the original palette which makes me
really happy that she's listening to
feedback but I I'm not and it's the same
warms over and over again I don't know
how many how much warm we can get I know
some people that's all they wears warms
and that's fantastic but ya know I think
I'm gonna skip that one I think I'm
gonna skip it I'm passing all in on the
desi and Katy stuff too even though they
seem like wonderful people I'm gonna
pass it I it just you know it's I think
it's great that they did a collection
for all people like I feel like they
really took into account neutral lovers
people that you know to get as many
people as possible interested in it like
I think it's great that they did that
but it doesn't excite me and I've heard
they're great I've heard they're
wonderful my eyeballs are like blurring
out for some reason okay bancini says
I'm going to buy the hood that hood a
desert palette I've heard good things
about me about me about it I'm reading
someone else's comment Sheila says
someone please talk me out a mothership
a girlfriend that's in here mother ships
in here let's talk about the mothership
Sheila let's talk you out of it
oh no did I not add it to the bag and
then I add it to my cart I try to oh man
okay well look let's let's good let's
find the mothership where's the
mothership there they are
okay there's three different pallets by
Pat McGrath is really like Pat McGrath
stuff overall there's definitely some
hit and miss things some things that can
be duped with other products I did a
dupe video for her lip kits that came
out
there's deadly some dude stuff but I
think I'm gonna pass on these if I was
gonna get one though I would probably
get sublime this is the one that calls
to me the most it looks like this but
these things are 125 bucks that's a lot
to quote Kathleen like because everyone
likes to talk about Kathleen lights in
here that's expensive that's expensive I
don't know I just can't I it's not it's
not calling to me enough it's not I
don't know I just I can't I can't do it
I can't do it you get 2 4 6 8 10 shadows
for 125 dollars and I know it's Pat
McGrath and they're probably fab but
maybe maybe another time like if she
sold a quad for like 40 bucks or
something maybe I've lived Natasha - no
no prices like maybe sold like a quince
for like 40 or 50 bucks maybe I might
get something like that I don't know but
even that like it makes my stomach sick
think about spending that much money
seems like a little hat I don't know man
I don't think I'm gonna get it though
I'm still not I don't think I'm gonna
get it with that one no it's not on the
anti whole sorry she'll I failed she was
my friend I'm sorry Sheila lie down I
can't give you up I can't give you a
straight up no Melissa says Lila's
better deal for 129 that's true that's
true but it's like Pat McGrath is pretty
good at putting out her line I have to
say I have to say okay let's talk about
something that's an easy pass let's talk
about an easy pass much a Cubs the wild
one iconic eyeshadow palette I think was
makeup struggles I was watching if you
guys are not subscribed to makeup
struggles totally not-safe-for-work
do not watch her channel around kids she
has a disclaimer at the beginning of all
of her videos where it's like I'm gonna
say cuss words if you are not cool with
that
then you don't want to watch this video
makeup struggles amazing she is
hilarious and she makes such great
points and I love her she's like my new
obsession so anyway I think it was her
that was talking
but that's like who said that
zebra-print was in style who told them
that who told them that oh let's just
make a zebra print like that that's a
good thing like zebra print a thing like
like what is that like I I if you love
zebra print I'm not trying to say you're
bad or anything if you love zebra print
but zebra print is not my personal style
it makes me kind of go I think on the
right person the right person can rock
some zebra print I am NOT one of those
people that can rock some zebra print
and the colors in here are not calling
to me I don't know it's just no that's a
no that's enough $99 knowing you got
dollars are you kidding me $99 no no
Marc Jacobs I tell you no I say no to
you I say no to you you get 20 shades
how bigger these pans I have to know it
doesn't say of course it doesn't say
because they're probably like half a
gram each mmm Marc Jacobs no I say no to
you Marc Jacobs all right let's move on
yeah
no thank you no no okay let's move on
okay this is another one that I think
make of struggles talked about this one
- what'd she call this the bird poop
palette I think I'm giving you all the
spoilers for her video I'm sorry
I think I'm pretty I'm gonna be really
upset if it's not makeup struggles if it
was somebody else but I'm pretty sure
she called this the bird poop palette
because it kind of looks like that it's
like ways like plop plop plop plop plop
I think it's kind of cool that they went
out there they went to do something
different the pans are different and I
give them credit for that I give them
credit for for making them a little bit
different that's cool but it's gonna be
a no it's gonna be enough no no $36 I
feel like it looks like a reasonable
price for it you get ten shades it's
probably pretty small though it's
probably only like this big but that's
gonna be enough it's gonna be enough
okay
this I thought was super gimmicky Seimei
tried this I would love to know this is
the G vol she knew our into D Tomas Cara
look at this thing G I am M ah
CKY gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky
oh I don't know what that was but this
is gimmicky like what even is that what
even is that like you you been why do
you need to bend your mascara wand down
why why is that a thing no I don't need
that in my life I don't need that I
don't need a bendy wands for $29 I
shouldn't have done that G I am them i
ck why gimmicky gimmicky what what what
gimmicky I forget all my cheers I wasn't
a cheerleader I was actually a football
manager so I hung out with the football
team without the cheerleaders which was
pretty awesome I must say because we got
to see team stretch and warm-ups and
that was the best part of my day back in
the day in high school I remember my
friends and I my two best girlfriends
and I were all football managers
together and we would sit at team
stretching warm-ups and go the bicycle
when they had their butts up in the air
and we would be like all right next up
anyway holographic highlighting powder
from milk makeup this is kind of like
what I was saying earlier was about be
like iridescent highlighters and the
purple highlighters I feel like they
just look really weird on me man and
they just look weird and purple
highlight is just not my thing and peach
highlight is not my thing either it just
doesn't look good on me it just looks
weird
you know I know I don't know it's a no
how much are those things $30 no okay
Kat Von D everlasting mini liquid
lipsticks set I personally do not like
Kat Von D liquid lipsticks very much I
can suffer through them if it's a
beautiful enough shade these shades are
all pretty deep and vampy I would not
use probably 3/4 of these
at least on the regular I might use them
for filming here and there but I
wouldn't use these on the regulars
because they're kind of deep for my
personal preferences and the formulas
kind of drying for me I don't I don't
dislike them as much as I dislike the
steel up but I don't really like them
very much not a fan not a fan the prism
palette Sarai wants to know I own the
prism palette I'm working on a review
for you for it so that is coming what is
my coloring I am well I was light medium
neutral but recently I've been told I'm
a light neutral I think I'm getting
paler as I get older so neutral I have
neutral undertones
what a beauty 3d highlighter palette
what is going on with the colored
highlighters I feel like Jeffrey star
started something with these color
highlighters like how is this purple a
highlighter like a highlighter is
supposed to bring light to the face it's
supposed to be light that's not light I
don't know I don't think that would even
be light on a deep skin tone that would
be like medium on a deep skin tone you
know what I mean like thinking about
like I'm trying to think of like you
know I'm a tan kind of deep like this
would still not be light on her I don't
think it would be more like a like a
blush II kind of thing on her I probably
look really pretty on her but this is a
no for me a yellow highlighter and
orange highlighter a peach highlighter
and a purple highlighter that is not for
me Blue Ivy wants to know about talk
about the vamp stamp I have never tried
it I may try it in the future I'm gonna
keep my mouth shut I may try it in the
future but I have never tried the vamp
stamp keep my mouth shut
I am so bad keeping my own secrets so
bad at it I need to sit my mouth I'm so
good at keeping other people's secrets
but I'm really really bad at keeping my
own secrets that's that's a secret about
me I can't keep my mouth shut when it
comes to my own things all right anyway
moving on I love it - she seems like a
real sweetheart okay Valerie says I
actually really love colored
highlighters but Valerie I feel like you
are like an out-of-the-box kind of
person you know like I feel like there
are certain people that are like
out-of-the-box thinkers there
out-of-the-box makeup wearers
out-of-the-box dressers like doing your
own thing
no just going for it and I just I can't
I can't do it but I respect you a
hundred percent for for being like that
absolutely tim says so far vamps stamp
is not good so I've seen oh well I'll
have to try it Cynthia says different
cultures like different colors yes I you
know what I do have a great point
Cynthia you know there's so much
variation in people out there that this
is just what I'm not gonna buy it's not
what you shouldn't buy it's what I'm not
gonna buy and I think there's a big
distinction there that I would never
tell other people you know you don't buy
this don't buy this even if I say I
don't think you should buy this I'm not
saying don't buy it yeah I think
everybody has a right to buy what they
want to buy you know what I mean I'm
like you're saying different cultures
different skin tones things like that
you know she'll says Jen do what do you
do you like the hourglass metallic
highlighter palette I need to look up a
picture of that I like the original
hourglass highlighters they're nice and
nice and light blue Ivy says the Brina
loves the vamps sample I love zabrina so
I don't know maybe it's a good thing
maybe I'll try latina is here are latina
and Julio down by the schoolyard I'm so
glad you're here
all right next up let's keep it going
the yso all ours full coverage matte
foundation I have no intention of trying
this it's it's $58 and it's $50 and it's
$58 that's a lot of money for a
foundation and and I you know I just
this is the thing if I wasn't a makeup
reviewer I would stop buying foundation
for the next year I wouldn't I wouldn't
buy any because I have foundations that
I love that I really really really love
that make me so happy that I don't need
anything else like for example for
example the Holika Holika BB cream that
I did for a review for for what the K
it's like 12 bucks on Amazon oh my gosh
I love that stuff I love it I definitely
recommend you check out that review if
you're looking for a light to medium
coverage foundation it has a little bit
of scent to it if you're sensitive to
scents but man that stuff is awesome I
love that so I've got like my staples I
love the older brand found
that's what I'm wearing today I love
that foundation I love a good light to
medium foundation and there's there's
just ones that work really well for me
why do I even need any more foundations
you know what I mean
so it's just I don't know I mean this
was sent out to a lot of influencers I'm
not sure if you saw the boxes of these
giant boxes of all the shades so there's
there isn't a lack of reviews on these
so I don't feel like I need to review it
I haven't gotten requests for it so it's
like mmm $58 no no Jay said so much
alcohol in that foundation which will
age your skin really ah let's look at
the ingredients Oh water cyclo hexa
siloxane denatured alcohol oh that's
definitely a no now oh now it's a hard
no it was a soft no before now AJ it's a
hard no I am NOT buying a foundation
that the third ingredient is alcohol
denatured alcohol there's alcohols that
are good like sido alcoholic those are
good do you Nate your alcohol or alcohol
D Nate you'll see mmm it's okay if it's
a little lower down but the third
ingredient oh heck no oh no and then I
so do i so dick deca cane with de cane
which is the next one that's like a
balancing ingredient so they use that in
a lot of liquid lipsticks so that it's
not so drying it's supposed to like take
away the dehydration so they're trying
to balance the looks like it looks like
they're trying to balance the Danitra
alcohol with the ISO dodecane mm-hmm and
the Rex and some of the other ones I'm
not quite familiar with some of these
things but mmm hard no hard no now all
right that's all I had in my cart and
now I'm bummed because we need more
things to talk about
oh my computer battery's dying hold on a
second I have the charger right here
oh it just fell out okay hold on
it's right here all right there we go
well we plugged in green light green
light go yay oh my gosh Susan says OMG
the ingredients in that YSL are horrible
for you if you care about your long-term
skincare do not use that
Thank You Susan AJ said the same thing
right above you that's so funny it was
like AJ and Susan like no mm-hmm
Bloo idea wants to know if these
comments are available after the video
ends no Tabitha do we have those those
chat notes posted anywhere because I
know Tabitha collects them but I don't
know if she posts them anywhere off to
ask her see if she's see if she's here I
haven't seen her posting in a while she
might just be listening no wait for her
a comment to see if she's keeping them
oh right wants to know what about the
new NYX palettes i swatched them at
generation Beauty and they actually did
see him up pretty nice to have this says
she can okay cool maybe we can post them
on what's up and make up somewhere that
would be good Oh Nicole the the YSL
foundation is the though that all at all
hours full coverage matte foundation the
they did seem really nice the next
pallets at generation Beauty but I don't
think I'm gonna pull the plug on him I
don't think I only gonna get him because
I can't review them and like I would
really love to support like a list
Ashley she's like the big one in there
that I'm like yes you know like I'm
really excited for like the other ones I
don't know was I don't know of them as
much as I know of Alyssa so I'm not
excited about them but but it would be
great to be able to support her but at
the same time I don't really need it and
then $30 a piece so that's kind of a
tipping point for me if they were 20 I
would probably get one but the $30
thing's killing me man like really for
next $30 yeah Tony says the same thing
she says I've heard mixed reviews of the
NYX palettes I'm not paying $30 for
drugstore palette I totally hear it I
totally hear you on that one
AJ says my butch just said drink your
alcohol don't put it on your pretty face
lmao I am with your butch on that one I
love how you call her your butch I'm
with her on that one I'm totally with
her some time I should stay here and
have a glass of wine with you guys I'm
one of these evening chats cuz right now
I just have water in a coffee cup
because I don't like making extra dishes
so I'll make my coffee in the morning
and then I'll just drink water out of
the same cup all day because I don't
like
extra dishes and I don't like drinking
out of like paper cups and things iced
Java says why can't you the next house
it's not that I can't review them it's
that I don't really have time to review

review and by the time I get them out to

seem to be good they seem to be good
Olivia says I will save my $30 to get
some GPS placed out there you go Mimi

you think of it Mimi I'd be curious to
know um Steph wants to know if the Hooda
foundation is any good I don't know they

it's like totally respect I think that's
awesome let's see okay let me Oh sir I
says Gigi did a collab with Maybelline's
$30 I don't say I don't think so yeah I

came out with that for $30 it does seem
like you get a lot in it but um yeah
mm-hmm all right let me see if I can
find some more stuff cause like my cart
I already went through everything and we
still got we're gonna do about five more
minutes or I can just you know what I'll
do I'll just let you guys give me

I'm just gonna read the comments and see
what you guys think I should talk about
whether I'm gonna buy it or not
Kia says GB is placing color drains new
pallets I would love to have those just
because I'm a huge fan of both GPS place
and color drained I there's no doubt in
my mind they're gonna be amazing because
there's both of those brands put out
consistently good eye shadow products
but you know mm-hmm yeah I'm probably
not gonna end up getting either the
woman from Julia's place said she would
send me anything if I contacted her but
I always feel really weird about being
like excuse me hello you said you would
send me something for a read can you
please send me so-and-so new palette
like I always feel weird about that and
brands have told me no really you can
tell me you know if you want me to send
you something I'll send it but I always
feel weird you know like something
doesn't sit right with me on that one
like I feel like if they really want me
to have it they'll send it to me without
me having to be like dude can you send
this to me you know I don't know I just
feel weird about that Valerie says did
you Jen did you hear about in the Julius
place drama with Tim Thalia
I saw that there was some drama but I
have no idea what it was
did not read what it was but I did see
there was some kind of drama I've been
reading the the reddit thread there's a
go beauty chatter thread on reddit that
I read occasionally because it's
interesting to see what people are
talking about when people are excited
about what people are upset about I
prefer that to like the Guru gossiper
kind of section cuz I feel like they're
more likely to be positive over on the
reddit than they are
Gogu Gosper is just about gossip so bar
number says Sephora give me more lip is
there a new one of those I think there
was there's a bold one there's a regular
one again it's just one of those things
where I'm not gonna use them you know
and I'm not going to review them so I'm
not gonna get it you know what I mean
Sarah says what has been the most
exciting holiday item for you Jen woo
that's a great question uh let's see
nothing there's nothing that it's been
I've been like oh my gosh this is the
best thing ever you know even like I'm
trying out the the prism palette I've
used it twice now and I find that it's
it's a little weird it's a little weird
like the the foil shades a little weird
but I'm working with it I'm working with
it I think you know this Tarte palette I
think is really cool as a gift you know
I think that's kind of exciting that
it's just it's a really cool gift but I
can't think of anything oh the kat von d
palette the kat von d palette I've
really been enjoying I just did a review
of the Satan Center ballad by Kat Von D
that one's really exciting I would say
that one I have something I saw the box
sitting over there I'm like yeah
definitely yeah the Kat Von D one there
we go
let's see Melissa says any Mac holiday
you're interested in nothing super
exciting for me except for the pretty
packaging Melissa I feel the exact same
way it's just the packaging I'm
interested in Blue Ivy wants to know if
I have smelled product candy yes it
smells amazing
I do like Prada candy very much the new
Gucci highlight I knew nothing about
that
AJ says genom you seen the Korean
skincare ad set at Sephora I've not seen
the Korean skincare actually no I think
I did see the Korean skincare set and I
looked through it and I already owned a
couple of things it was the same kind of
thing as with the the Sephora favorites
kit one where I was like there wasn't
enough in it to make me want it ash says
Wayne Goss brushes I own a couple of
Wayne Goss brushes and I like them both
very much I would love to get more Wayne
Goss brushes eventually unfortunately
they are out of my price range so I
don't see myself getting them anytime
soon and I am like overloaded with
brushes and honestly I really like my
motor brushes I really like my Real
Techniques brushes I really like my
beauty junkies brushes so it's like I I
feel like you know I don't I don't want
to spend money on like Mac brushes and
Sigma brushes and Wayne Goss brushes
anything over like five dollars ten
dollars a brush I'm like for an
eyeshadow brush I'm like you know maybe
my eyeshadow game would be better if I
bought more expensive brushes but it's
like I cringe I've been talking about if
I've been thinking about getting the Mac
I forget which one it is the one that
Stephanie Nicole swatches her foiled
shadows with the flat one I've thought
about getting that much twenty-five
bucks like 25 bucks for a brush like I
can't even I can't even bring myself to
do it you know but yeah you know one day
I do need to just suck it up and get
that one so that I can use it for
swatches cuz it's for the channel and I
feel like I need a better brush to
swatch foiled shadows you know all right
let's say Lee says I say this to my
husband all the time if you don't remind
them they didn't send it to you and it's
because they forget I think that yeah I
know
I she's talking about the devious place
thing about them not sending it to me
it's okay Jenna says the 242 I think it
is the 242 April says the - 1 - I think
it's I think John is where I think it is
the 242 Julia says Matt Macy's had Mac
brushes 50% off the other day well now
yet tell me Julia where were you where
were you when I needed you Oh Wanda says
what about the Miss glam brushes I tried
two brushes from Miss glam and I was not
impressed they felt very cheap to be
honest with you they're beautiful
they're gorgeous
they feel like a cheap version of a luck
zbrush and I really like my lucky
brushes too that's another brush brand
that I like but Luxy starts to get a
little more expensive for me
Blanca says what's better Real
Techniques remote uh if I had to choose
I would choose Mota some of that is
personal because I have met some people
that work for Mota so I feel like if
that kind of put because they're very
similar they're very very similar in a
lot of ways so it's hard for me to like
they're really like in application wise
I feel like they're pretty pretty
similar they're almost pretty much the
same so something else something has to
push me over one away the other because
it's not the quality it's not the price
so it has to be that I like the people
at Mota and I've never met the people at
Real Techniques so I would probably pick
Mota you know I don't know but they're
both good they're both really good and I
also feel like Mota has a better
selection they have more brushes overall
I believe I do like the Real Techniques
bold metals brushes though I've looked
at that bold metals holiday set and I
was thinking about getting that because
I love the bull of metals brushes I
really like the blush brush from the
bold metals line it's really really good
they're eye shadow brushes are really
good from the bold metals line so I feel
like some well I don't know I don't know
if they're better than the modal ones
but they're good they're really good all
right let's do a couple more comments
and then I'm gonna go ahead and pop off
of here Oh Lindsay says they're Macy's
website it's thought they're on sale
right now are you serious I'm totally
going on there right after this is over
and checking out there Mac stuff oh my
gosh Melissa wants to know if Besame is
doing a holiday collection last I heard
wasn't Besame the one that did the snow
white collection I think I think I think
Damaris says stray I just ordered mug
brushes from Haute look I have the
makeup geek flat the foiled brush from
makeup geek and I feel like that only
works makeup feet for heels I have
trouble with all the other flips I don't
know what it is but I can't get a good
brush swatch with one of those flat
shader brush is I really need to just
get that suck it up and get the Mac one
overall make up ego had a great
experience with though great experience
