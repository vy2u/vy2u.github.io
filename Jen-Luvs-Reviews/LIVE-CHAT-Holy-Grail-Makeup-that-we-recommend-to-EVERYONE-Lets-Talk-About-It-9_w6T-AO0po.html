of a makeup chat I am so excited to see
you well see you in the collective
bringing of makeup awesomeness that is
going to be taking place right over
there
I have old makeup on my face I apologize
for that oh I hate it when that happens
generally go to start watching this
tutorial and then they have old makeup
on their face and it's like get that off
before you start oh my child is throwing
a tantrum oh my God my husband's taking
care of it she's she's stressed action
as a birthday party in 30 minutes and
he's asking me to do something and
that's off topic we were here to talk
about some makeup in here my child
yelling my husband's taking care of it
she's not alone I promise let me Center
you a little bit better all right so I'm
really excited to talk to you today
about Holy Grail formulas and products
now I thought about these as those
picking these products and I was like
you know what I don't want to pick
products and tools and things that I
feel like everybody could own and enjoy
and I didn't pick them lightly like I
really thought about it and I thought
about you know all the conversations
I've had with people in the collective
brain all the things that we've
discussed and the products that seemed
the most popular with everybody I didn't
take an official poll but there are
certain products that keep coming up
over and over and over again as ones
that everybody seems to love so I've got
a selection of them sitting next to me
because opposed idli when I turn around
it freaks people out sometimes so it got
a little table now and we're going to
talk about some of those product but
before we start I know that some of you
um you know want to get right into the
makeup but I do want to say hello to the
collective brain it's really important
to me to say hello to everyone and to
connect with them before we begin so if
you do not like this part you can go
ahead and skip ahead until you see me
show a product and then that's when you
know that we are starting with the
review so I'm gonna go ahead and say
hello to some of the first people that
were here so Orlov hello good morning
good morning to Leanne good morning
tabatha and Nikki and KJ and Stephanie
and fizzy pub she says she doesn't
really have any holy girl she's traced
to see what everyone recommends good
morning to Cal see she can't believe
she's early
good morning Krista and
let's say good morning Lizzy good to
have you here I'm excited that you're
here for the first time as well good
morning to Sammy
good to have you back and KJ says what's
the topic today I didn't get through
though the hole what's up a makeup news
I know because the news is long this
week there's lots of good stuff coming
out the morning - Stephanie Beach singer
who has a YouTube channel be EITS ing er
her first name is Stephanie good morning
- emoji bear and good morning to be bees
Beauty bar so excited to have you here
in good morning - Gina and Jenn and Jan
she says we made it with lots of emojis
yay hello hello and Kelsey she says
what's what's everyone's temps like this
morning 28 degrees here in snowy we
haven't had a flake of snow this year
not a flake in Maryland I don't know
what's going on it's been warm and I
don't think it's warm today I haven't
been outside yet I pretty much just got
up I brushed my hair I brushed my teeth
and I got these products together for
you and I cleaned up my room a little
bit but other than that haven't done
much good morning to summer and and
we're gonna go ahead oh and Stephanie a
good morning Stephanie I'm gonna oh and
Sammy I'm going to go ahead and scroll
down and and if I didn't say hello to
you good morning and hello to you I'm so
happy that you're here let's go ahead
and start talking about some Holy Grail
products now oh um
Christa says that it was pouring there
it was pouring here last night I was
like - John I was like is that rain he's
like that sounds like a plane going by
or something cuz we have an airport not
that far from us I was like I think
that's ringing and we looked outside and
it was pouring like straight pouring
alright so let's go ahead and start with
oh you know what I didn't get out with
primers you know I got everything else
out
I forgot about flavors show me that real
quick I still got my jammy bottoms on I
just changed my shirt see you guys
caught me in my I'm a primer well I was
just my panties I don't want to spend
forever looking for primers my holy
grail I am
right now one that I think that
everybody would love is eaten by urban
decay I really think that this is a
phenomenal eyeshadow primer and the
reason why I think this is a standout
over all other eyeshadow primers oh
thank you gonna love my beauties so the
reason I think this is a Stannah overall
all other eyeshadow primers is because
of the opacity of it the let it's got
that same Urban Decay primer potion
awesomeness but then it's opaque when
you put it on your eye so it doesn't
matter what color your skin tone is so
if you're a deeper skin tone don't worry
about this because what it does is it
gives you that lighter sheet of paper
almost like putting down a white base
like you'll see a lot of tutorials will
they'll put the NYX pencil in milk this
is similar to that but I feel like the
formula is better as far as keeping your
eyeshadow on longer than the NYX pencil
in milk you can always put milk on top
of this but I really really like this a
lot it's a relatively new purchase for
me and I just think that it's fantastic
it's just a really nice place to start
you know it just gives you a great white
sheet of paper to start your drawing on
you know what I mean it's really really
really nice and I haven't find found a
drugstore eye primer that I think would
work for everybody because you know oily
lids dry lids all of that I really feel
like this would work for everybody so if
it doesn't work for you please type it
in the comments below if it does well
just say in general if any of these
products work for you type them in the
comments below if they don't work for
you type it in the comments below but
then tell us why you don't think they
work for you is it because of your skin
type your skin tone what is it about
that product so that we can all learn
from you and the collective brains
makeup awesomeness so we can all just
learn more from each other and really be
a great community okay so the next thing
okay can you get eaten at Ulta you
should be able to I don't see why you
wouldn't be able to be you should be
Lisa says even to her Holy Grail too I'm
sure you just have to use a tiniest
amount you really do just have to use
the tiniest amount and then else he says
she love to try the original primer
potion see the original primer potion
from Urban Decay I feel like is doable I
feel like there you know there's I mean
you get that formula but there isn't
anything that makes it so so so much
better than let's say the Milani one
or you know the one from Coastal Scents
which is really really good you know
nothing really makes it be unique we're
eating I feel like is a standout like
you can't find it anywhere else you know
what I mean I'm speaking of that I
didn't want to mention also give a shout
out to painterly from Mac also soft
ochre I've heard is wonderful it just
depends on what shades would like these
Mac Paint Pots are also really really
good to have that blank sheet of paper
so whatever shade you like to start with
these Mac Paint Pots are really really
good
I had this forever and you can see that
it's starting to crack around the
outside but it's not dried out it still
it feels like clay it's got kind of a
very clay like consistency and that's
what that looks like and I really like
these a lot too I think they're
wonderful okay got a box down here I'm
just gonna drop stuff into the box as I
go so that I know what I've talked about
and what I haven't so all right let me
get some more coffee and I was I've been
reading up cool free mug if you've got
your lots of the make up coffee mug or
any coffee mug we can cheers right now
adore coffee yup Eden is available at
Sephora and Ulta Kristen wants to know
if she needs that she just look that can
I speak she wants know if it helps your
makeup stay longer and yes I do believe
that it does absolutely I do believe
that it does it's a little thicker than
eaten it's got a little more of a
concealer kind of feel like a cream
concealer kind of feel where Eden is
more like a primer kind of feel if that
makes sense
okay primer is my pink Shirley is my jam
Ashley says yes all right let's go ahead
and go into concealer now that we kind
of touched on conceal a little bit
here's a couple of them that I feel like
seem to work for everybody this is the
instant age rewind dark circle eraser
see mister worked for everybody my
biggest critique about this is the
sponge is kind of you gotta throw this
away eventually if you don't use it you
got to throw it away because it's just
it's not hygienic you can't clean it at
all I mean it's just you know but it
works really really really well and
everybody seems to love this thing
another thing that I wanted to mention
is the time bomb by the bomb this was
mine has been my holy grail concealer
for ever and I really
really love this a lot and this one
seems to work for everyone as well it is
more of an oily kind of consistency so
if you have oily under eyes I'm not sure
if this would work as well as somebody
with drier under eyes or normal under
eyes but this does not crease it's just
a fantastic concealer I can't believe I
forgot to get out by bare minerals
powder concealer I'm not gonna waste
time going to flip around and try to
find it but the the bare minerals loose
powder concealer for power concealer is
the best concealer I have ever used if
in life I really really enjoy it a lot
it is so wonderful and I've heard rave
reviews from so many people and I it was
my concealer of the year Kelsey's saying
the la girl concealer is she's like oh
I've heard great things about that too
but I have not tried that I'm gonna go
ahead and look at the collective brain
right now and see what everyone else is
saying is there holy girl concealer
because I know this is a big one for a
lot of people trying to find one
Sabby says I adored the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the NARS creamy
concealer Chelsea says the fit me for
her
Yesenia says la girl hands-down blinky
slurps says elf HD concealer is her
favorite living like Julie fit me
concealer is awesome hello Alexandria
and then Tarte creaseless concealer from
staff Ashley says the NYX one is great I
have to kind of scroll down a little bit
Leanne says the fit me and Taylor says I
don't know why be age rewind turns
splotchy on me oh wow oh my goodness
lisa says oh I lost I think she said it
cosmetics I believe Krista says the
L'Oreal visible lift blur and K says she
loves the benefit erase paste and he
erased paste I think I've said this
before I used to have a friend that had
really bad acne scarring and she swore
by the erase paste it erased her acne
scarring like it erased it like you
could still see the texture of course
but any discoloration was gone with the
benefit here a space for like really
like when you really want to cover
something benefit erase paste Carey says
the oh hi Carrie the Mac Pro Longwear is
her favorite carries an old friend of
mine from way back at the beginning my
channel though she was one of the first
people I ever did
with and she had way more subscribers in
the end time all right so anyway
concealers concealers concealers if I
did not say your favorite concealer and
you have a little girl concealer feel
free leaving in the comments below tell
us why you love it talk about your skin
care your skin type so people know what
is good
we are 12 minutes in so we got to keep
on rockin let's talk about foundation I
do have a couple of foundations now
foundation is one of those things that
is very very hard to find one that's
universal that seems to work for
everybody so this is the best I've got
with my normal skin this is the best
I've got so I had the hourglass
immaculate liquid to powder foundation
this when I got this I was so so
impressed with it I was like yes this is
my foundation for life it is a pump
which is good and then it comes out like
this it is kind of thick which I do like
I like a thicker consistency for
Foundation and why I love this is it's
really got that you see how it's liquid
but then when you blend it in it really
turns into like a powder I put on way
too much I put on like an entire face
worth of worth of foundation here and it
looks better on my face and does on my
hands you know hands and faces sometimes
with different tones but see how it's
completely matte now like it's so cream
to powder and it just dries so flat like
I don't even need a face powder with
this it just dries down so nicely it
feels wonderful on the skin just so so
so enjoyable to you I am going to got a
baby boy so that I can not be covered
and foundations the other one that I
wanted to mention it's my favorite
drugstore formula of face foundation II
kinds of things is the Garnier BB cream
now there was a rumor awhile back that
this was being discontinued but I saw a
huge stock of it at my drugstore the
other day so I don't think it's being
discontinued I've also seen this at Ulta
I don't think it's going anywhere this
is a wonderful wonderful product on this
one is the combination to Lily I do
believe that they have a dry skin
version as well correct me if I'm wrong
please but I do think there's a dry skin
regime as well
and it is wonderful the staying power is
fantastic it you can build this up to
like a medium ish coverage and one thing
like I was watching Jordan delivering
the other day and if you're not
subscribed to Jordan Liberty he's a pro
he's like Wayne Goss you know what I
mean like he's so not a beauty guru he's
a pro and he knows so much like amazing
and he has funny videos - it's not just
like you don't need to subscribe
- I'm not subscribed but follow Jordan
Liberty on Instagram he puts up some of
the best Instagram posts they are
hilarious with all with his models they
like lip sync and dance and it's great
and he's a super nice guy I met him at
UM was it I Matt's last year I think it
was I Matt's last year sometime I met
him and oh my gosh just the nicest guy
yes I'm Matt's last year so sweet but
anyway he was saying about how we really
have gone so far that Instagram route of
that full face of makeup like the daily
makeup is like the way people would
dress up no people would wear this full
face of makeup only if they were going
to a special event and now it's people's
everyday this really full face look you
know and it doesn't have to be like that
because our natural skin is so can be so
beautiful you know and you can just use
a little bit to kind of touch up your
spots that don't then aren't so even and
really make a natural look for most
people so this one here is like that
where it's it's the BB cream it's it's
definitely a layer coverage but it gives
you it lets your natural skin shine
through but evens out your skin tone so
if you have the luxury like I do I'm not
having to do a lot of concealing you
don't don't have to do that don't don't
let Instagram and YouTube convince you
that you need to put on a very thick
face of makeup it's not a hundred
percent necessary you know where we're
really going on a very strange trend
right now but anyway rant over stepping
off the soapbox let's talk more about
prana hooks this is really really good
I'm gonna go ahead and go over the
elective brain and see what they think
about their favorite foundations
somebody says thanks beauty Hall for one
one she's an amazing Instagram channel
to follow she's one of my reporters
she's awesome
let's see Sara says I'm still on the
hunt for
the ground foundations the foundation
the closest yet is the Urban Decay Naked
Skin Foundation the only problems that
it seems to not exactly set i've dry
skin and huge pores stephanie says Wayne
Goss talks about scaling down the makeup
a lot
I'm ringing through the cabinet Quan
book and he says the same thing seems to
be that makeup artists help us stay in
check I hope so I hope so
so if let's see you see there anything
okay red hearted 8:08 says Revlon naked
is the app is amazing that's what she's
been loving lately and Sarah says of BB
Creams I can vote for the dr. jart the
normal one in the silver packaging I
love you too Lisa and then bb's Beauty
bar says Merle Norman foundation is her
yes and Yesenia says anyone with a color
would be okay
anyone with color the best BB cream is
kiss New York aqua BB cream yes kiss New
York aqua BB cream for women of color
Thank You Yesenia for that and then
Stacey says she bought the do or hide
your life BB cream and it's great and
then kanesha says Estee Lauder Double
Wear definitely and Mac waterproof
alright we're gonna go ahead and move on
you know the only Holy Grail face paper
on this in my life is the Rimmel stay
matte I'm like if I ran out of this it
would be like no and I'm running out of
it and I'm feeling that no right now I
really love this stuff like I really
feel like I need this in my life the
only the next closest thing and I know
it's right here somewhat the closest
thing to oh no I would feel as if I ran
out of my mac mineralize skinfinish and
medium but I would probably buy this
first just because of the price point I
don't see a huge difference between
these I mean I feel like this is maybe a
little more finely milled but this is a
fantastic face pattern it's like 3 bucks
go grandma go like really and truly like
something you just don't need to spend a
fortune on you just don't amazing cover
FX setting powder is what I'm Chuck
choocha la Ciccia law says I don't know
sorry if I said that wrong and when I
leaned everybody sang Rimmel stay matte
yes Nicole is here from yay or nay
Nicole nailed your package yesterday
just so you know we have to keep going
cuz it's ten nineteen I have so much to
show you so much to show you
um actually you lake's let's see hold on
Krista says the NYC translucent powder
and the K says I love those dumb
hourglass and then Marlene says she
wants to try the airspun but she doesn't
want the mess and then oh thank you for
appreciating that I I'm sorry for
butchering your name the one that looks
kind of like chocolate chuckle oh I
think it is chuckle uh Leslie says she
also loves benefits hello flawless and
Abby says L'Oreal press True Match is
amazing
Jenna says Laura Mercier adidas says
bourgeoisie bourgeois bushwa healthy mix
powder she loves it and she has normal
to dry skin Ashley says she often uses
the mac mineralize skinfinish as a
powder and then I saw a pores no more
I'm not sure who that was it disappeared
too quick I'm Stephanie says yes
hourglass for life and Helen says I
don't use too much powder but it's
Elizabeth Arden is her favorite and
happy birthday to Evers birthday it is
oh I'm sorry Nikki it says my PC working
is up can anybody see me you know what's
happening nikki is I see your little um
your little wrench and I keep skipping
you accidentally because using young
people put the little act I keep
thinking it's an act and then skip you
so I apologize Nikki I'm skipping Steph
and I'm skipping tab too so it's not I
didn't mean to I will try to make sure I
don't skip you by accident that little
wrench that tells me that she's a
moderator is confusing me so sorry about
that I keep in my brain it was an act
and I was skipping him all right let's
keep moving out on moving out of moving
on all right let's go into blush now I
wasn't gonna mention this one because
they were out of stock but now you can
get them on Kat Von D Beauty calm but I
am Essex
Kat Von D I talked about this in the
show today this is my favorite blush
formula of all time there are a few of
them available like Kat Von D beauty in
the old school section it's an amazing
formula I got quite a few people hooked
on this before they discontinued it I
don't know why nobody talked about these
they're amazing just so-so
just they're buildable and that's what I
love about them they're creamy they're
pigmented but they're buildable when you
put it on your face initially it is not
clown face and then it builds up there's
some things you just want it to go BAM
blush is not one of those things that
you just want to go BAM on your face
because then you just got to you got to
blend it out and you've gotta you know
it's more work you know what I mean it's
just so much more work if a blush isn't
one that slowly builds so you really
want to get something that isn't so
in-your-face but then also isn't not
pigmented so this one is wonderful also
any blush by the ball you can get on
HauteLook
and get a blush by the ball these are
wonderful this one is called Argyle and
it's one of the in skåne blush is this
is my favorite formula blush by the balm
and it's just wonderful this one will
take you to clown face if you apply too
much so you just want to get a really
fluffy brush when you use this so that
you can get a light application at first
but just the lasting power and the
beauty miss is unbelievable unbelievabl
another wonderful formula it's very
famous is the tarte formula of course I
heard a little birdy told me that they
reformulated the wet and wild blushes
which are known for being amazing and
now they are not good and my heart broke
like somebody in the collective brain
told me that she was like they're
terrible the new formula of the color
icon blushes is bad and I was like I've
heard wonderful things about the Milani
blush is I have not personally tried
them it's one of those that I just I see
it in the store and it's like do I need
another blush no I really need to get
some just for comparison though and I
don't I I you know I just haven't gotten
any but that's one that the collective
bringing always talks about is amazing
is the Milani blushes
Mary saying she loves Milani Luminoso
and that's I've heard so much about that
one as well let's go ahead and start
talking about am I going too fast maybe
I'm going too fast I have so many things
I want to show you though so so so many
things the Milani rosebushes everybody's
talking about and everybody and a makeup
color says some elf ones are great KJ
says and then over there going really
fast color pop blushes and Chanel
blushes by Julie Julie says that spring
says Milani equals so good and Pam says
Luminoso forever or like this is this is
these are real people here these are
real people makeup color says NARS
orgasm of course that one's very very
famous I've heard so many people that
love that blush I don't see it as being
a standout blush that like makes me go
oh my gosh I have to have this and I
think it's the NARS formula it's not the
color I think it's the formula that I
think it's just good too good formula
but I feel like there are better
formulas out there than the NARS blush
formula oh my gosh did I just say that
oh that's just my personal but I know a
lot of people really really love them so
don't take me as the ultimate I know all
like a lot of people love NARS blushes
they're just not my personal favorites
but they aren't buildable like we were
saying what we really want in a blush is
something that's buildable but I can't I
don't know like it just doesn't do it
for me for some reason I don't know I
don't know I want to love them more but
there are a lot of people that disagree
with me so please please please don't
take my word as the ultimate and then
Krista says I don't love NARS blushes
when i swatched them nothing shows up oh
we're getting into that chuckle ah we're
getting into that alright since you
brought it up has to be said has to be
said I've showed this before I have a
drawer a stupid drawer of contouring
stuff I just got this one I got two of
these I got this I got this I got this
yes oh my god joint products why this is
Kevin a Quan by the way and I will tell
you that if I had to choose one contour
palette to use the rest of my life it
would be this I'm not kidding I'm not
kidding
oh it actually kind of ties with my
Kevin of guanlin I would have to choose
between these two and I would probably
honestly if I'm truly being honest I
would probably pick Kevin a Quan just
because it makes me feel fancy and
that's the only reason that's the only
reason it's not because it's better
because it makes me feel fancy
this one isn't available anymore though
so that was another reason why I wasn't
really showing that one for quality wise
quality wise elf nailed it on this
palette nailed it
if you I hear some people saying I can't
contour I can't contour saw that it
might be the products you're using it
might not be you it might be the product
you're using I would seriously seriously
recommend getting this one in trying it
it is so wonderful it is the perfect
perfect contour shade right there so
perfect
Yesenia do you have this one because I
need a woman of color to tell me and I I
hope you have this one right there
because I wonder whether this would work
for a woman of color okay do you have
this one because I really need to know
any women of color in here own this den
eh even you don't own that she says
she's not a contour contour person but
I'm telling you the formula of this is
so amazing I'm gonna swatch the cabinet
Quan next to it this is the crema Quan
contour powder this is $40 on its own I
must watch it next to it can you tell
which ones with it I mean I just swatch
them so you know which ones which but
right here that's the Alpha and that's
the cabinet Quan are you kidding me
this is $40 on its own this is six
dollars for the entire palette I
Senya it works for me but I don't know
if darker okay so you said yeah is like
a medium looked like a tan skin tone
she's um you know she's got like a like
a golden tan gorgeousness going on on
her skin tone so yes I mean you can kind
of see what it looks like on my skin
tone of course someone that's really
deep it's you know contouring powders
are going to be really difficult but
done that joke in a long time so I give
myself past but girlfriend amazing
amazing amazing
hi everyone from Melbourne Australia oh
it's like the middle of night there
ellaby welcome welcome welcome
I love the Australia's the Australis AC
onto our cream contour palette thank you
so much for that for our Australian
friends Linda says I love the elf it
works for me Oh feel free since I'm not
scrolling up if you're in the collective
brain right now and I don't see your
comment feel free to type it again
because I'm not scrolling back up scroll
back up but I'm not doing that today
so uh hula oralist says hula hula is a
great bronzer whole is a fantastic
bronzer I would not contour with hoola
it is very warm unless you have a very
warm skin tone and you feel like you can
get away with it but from everything
that I'm learning about contouring you
really want to contour with a neutral to
cool tone no matter what your skin tone
is so beauty all for one one bath says I
love a cat Von D shade + light contour
palette I like my shading like contour
palette I don't love it but I do like it
very much
Taylor says oMG every time I check the
elf contour powders go out of stock but
its back Kristen wants to know if I
tried the elf cream contour the cream
contour no I have not pama loves hoola
is saying it says city color city color
is great but it's one of those that
gives me clown face like that like
really fast but the pigmentation is
amazing and for the price you can
definitely work with some city color and
make some gorgeous looks the cheek
products are fantastic
but city color I've tried some of the
other products and I don't enjoy them
but I vouch for their face products and
either their blushes their bronzers
things like that if you don't know about
City color you can get it a 5
if you happen to have a fight below
that's more of like an East Coast to
central United States thing or the city
color website really really works well
for me but it does take you to clown
face very very very quickly Pam says she
heard the elf highlight palette sucks oh
I don't know I didn't get that when I
was out of stock when I bought my big
huge thing Adina says I love the sleek
palette with the contour shade highlight
and blush such a good product and then
summer says Too Faced Park Avenue
princess princess whatever reason
doesn't work great on me like it's
really warm and weird on my skintone I
don't know it's just weird on me I don't
know but I know a lot of people
absolutely love it absolutely love it
and it's very famous for a reason but
for some reason it just doesn't work for
me I don't know why Ashley says thoughts
on the Smashbox contort it yeah it's an
exact dupe for the elf one exact exact
in the elf video that I did I wouldn't
swatch them off for you video that I did
I showed when I bought this the swatches
of these all just hold them next to each
other for today for the sake of time
they're exact dupes except for with the
elf one you get an extra shade which is
this one down here this lightest shade
their exact tubes exact Gibson formula
exact dupes in lasting power exact dupes
in everything you're chatting right now
Jennifer you're doing it you've got a
girlfriend you've totally got it Zooey
says your Wi-Fi is being stupid Oh No
hopefully it's not every body
hopefully it's not everybody makeup
color says palette contour from makeup
revolution is great wonderful and then
I'm glad you're on the iPad now tired
mom and then Pam says I want the lunatik
palette so bad
stephanie says man y'all are you talking
me into the elf palette real fast it's
really good it's really good
alright let's move on and I want to get
into highlighters and then we're gonna
go into a shadows Holy Grail highlighter
very lou manizer by the balm definite
holy grail status here it's always been
my holy grail I don't see that ever
changing it is it's famous for a reason
it's the most gorgeous highlight and
every
loves Mary Lou everybody loves Mary Lou
butts color cops lunch money okay shoo
I've never seen this is an exact dupe
it's just a different formula so you
have to be willing to deal with that
creamy formula that color pop has but
it's an exact pretty much an exact dupe
I think that Mary Lou is tad tad tad tad
tad bit peachy but on your cheap not
gonna be able to tell the difference
nine episodes
you don't can't tell good I put them
both on you can't tell the difference
they're both awesome they're both
awesome this is another one that is holy
broil status for me and this is the
aluminum blush stripes and I love this
one because it it looks like they
purposely I don't know I didn't tell and
asked them but it looks like they're
purposely designed this from any skin
tones which makes me so so stinkin happy
it's just oh it's got a peachy shade
it's got a cool tone it's got a warm
tone and it's got a shade that looks
good for deep skin tones these less to
over here this one is very shimmery this
one's more subtle or you can just swirl
them all together if you want to I'd
like to use them in the stripes but
they're very very very good indicating
one says hi Jen the color pop equals
Becca opal yes there's one let me show
you that one because we do have one
I do have duck example Becca's opal is
fantastic okay this is champagne pop
hold on let me find home this is my opal
this is my opal this is Becca's opal
okay
people ask me why I have so much makeup
this is why so that I can tell you guys
about it there's Becca's open
yes watch me wisp yes
here's the colour-pop doop Rebekah's
opal there's wisp
so there's Becca's opal and there's wisp
again it's that creamy formula though so
if you don't like that creamy formula
and you want a powder formula you're
gonna have to stick with the Becca but
lasting powers great lasting powers
great definite recommends definite
recommend all right summer says Laura
Laura Mercier's matte radiance is
awesome
Nikki says I love the laura mercier in
oh one it's a must-have for all and then
let's see Jonathan said is she making a
sales pitch no I'm not selling any of
these products just so you know I'm not
sponsored by any of these companies
Lilly says laura geller
laura got one right here
there you go I'm not sure if any of
these products were sent to me I don't
focus on whether they were sent to me
but I didn't I'm not sponsored buying
these companies I'm not being paid by
any of these companies let me show you
this I don't think any of them were sent
to me I mean look I'll take a look
through and make sure none of them were
sent to me I'll let you know if any of
them were sent to me there's lower
dealers gilded honey it's absolutely
gorgeous because I think that's
important for you guys to know if they

Jonathan says you remind me of a school

alright moving on because it is 10:37
Jonathan but Jonathan's being nice so he
can stay all right moving on then the
module get him if he says anything
inappropriate he's fine
here's because he's a boy doesn't mean
it can't be here alright so next up we
want to talk eyes shadow out as three
pallets that I personally picked out as
ones that I feel like everyone was
hiding it I'm trying to hide it from you
I don't think I hid it very well I would
say these two right here the naked the
urban decay original naked or the naked
two I would say pick whichever one calls
to you but these are ones where I feel
like one of these two is going to be
awesome for you no matter what no matter
what I think one of these is gonna be
amazing and I don't think anybody would
disagree with me on that I really don't
I mean the formula is amazing the amount
of looks you can create with these
pallets is amazing and it's wonderful
it's absolutely wonderful my only
complaint about my naked 2 is I lost my
booty call my booty golf fell out all
right so my booty call fell out other
than that I'm very happy with this
palette so yes just the amount of looks
you can create I mean and there's so
many tutorials on YouTube on these
things like so many so I mean if you're
not sure how to use this there's a lot
of help out there for using these things
they're wonderful so just pick one give
it some love you will love it when one
that I would definitely recommend
is of course the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I see a couple of people saying
chocolate bar palette I just got this
few months ago I finally broke down and
got it and I was like you know what I
didn't think I needed it because it's
just another neutral palette but it's
not on and I've said that a bunch of
times just some of the shades in here
are so so stinkin amazing like creme
brulee is probably one of my favorite
eyeshadow shades of all time it's a gold
but it's got pink undertones you know
what I just realized you guys we're on
my regular webcam we're not even on the
good camera I forgot to hook up my
regular at my good web camera oh man oh
well too late now Julie now hopefully
you guys can see everything I apologize
will be back to better quality next week
but I have my microphone on so the
ceiling should be awesome but the camera
sorry about that you guys being with you
be who you want to be says she loves the
electric palette that's what I haven't
been able to get into this is just so
crazy it's so crazy so the star says she
needs a personal makeup shopper that's
what we're doing right now girlfriend
collective brain we're looking you up
take some long notes in the well there
you go I have someone go out and buy
them for you if you can afford it Snape
sunny says excited for the peanut butter
and jelly palette I think that looks
really neat too this your face being
friend jelly but anyway just an amazing
palette if this is calling to you I
definitely recommend getting it as far
as the semi-sweet I've heard that that
one isn't quite as good very rarely do I
hear someone that likes the semi-sweet
better than the original but it's very
good very good and the smell is amazing
the smell is amazing the drugstore
account that I want to recommend to you
is comfort zone by wet and wild this is
was one of my first palettes that I got
from the drugstore where I was like wow
this is from the drugstore what are you
kidding me amazing just really good
quality on this shade down here is one
that a lot of people talk about there's
a matte color that's this color there's
a Kat Von D the shade shifter eyeshadow
we talked about in the show today is
a dupe for this what's close to a dip
it's not exactly the same but how fun is
this color how fun how fun is that
I mean what's drugstore and that's the
might apply to the eyes chew like that's
not just a swatch that's the way it
applies on the eye but oh my gosh
kyla says that the when palette is great
I've heard mixed reviews on the grind
palette I've heard that if you're a
light skin tone it can be amazing if
you're not mmm yes max club thank you so
much and then shades in here are
wonderful this one up here this brow
bone shade it says brow bone but just
what like how is this a drugstore
palette how is this I'm running out of
real estate here how is that a drugstore
shade like are you kidding me are you
kidding me amazing amazing
the beware of the wet wild palettes in
the white packaging that's my biggest
advice to you because they could be very
hitting this the black packaging tends
to be pretty good so there you go there
you go
Steph says I pretty much need to own the
entire Glen collection the big thing
from the Glen collection everybody's
freaking out over at least um X parka
and join Liberty wear this was the blush
palette seem that seems to be the thing
to get I'm also the lipsticks if you
like Reds
alright so moving on it's 1042 oh I just
realized my battery's not plugged in I
don't want you guys because one time I
battery died while I was talking to you
and that was not good so I'm gonna plug
this in real quick I'm so mad about a
camera now alright I've lots of things
to love to talk to you about we only
have 29 plus 18 minutes alright um Beth
says she wants that go in blush palette
om youtube you and me both girlfriend I
probably won't get it because I don't
need it and everyone and their
grandmothers gonna review it and I just
don't like rushing to review something
like I'd rather review a bunch of
different drugstore products that people
may or may not be getting but yes and
then makeup colors too sleek palettes
let's see the wet and wild palette the
name is comfort zone you can find it at
any drugstore they sell them everywhere
it's so good now he says I love the lime
crime Venus grunge and melt cosmetics
for magnetic shades does anyone know
about anymore palettes with red and
crease shades I could probably find some
but it would take me a while so I don't
want to spend a lot of time on it but
definitely if you have some
recommendations for reddish crease
shades and a palette definitely type
them into the comments below or in the
collective braid now all right so let's
go ahead and move on to I want to tell
you my new Holy Grail eyeliner product I
got this like last week so I can't 100%
say Holy Grail because I have to see how
Ages but oh my gosh the brow stylist
definer by L'Oreal oh my goodness this
is an OMG moment I'm gonna do my brows
right now with this thing let me show
you first it's so so thin alright let me
show you this you've got to see this I
have to switch over to them so I can see
myself
watch this well it's just washing button
oh man it's coming it's coming
I'm looking in this terrible camera oh
my goodness oh I love a good mirror I
got my mirror instead so I can see what
in the world I'm doing and that worked
pretty well okay other side it so goes
on so easily I need to get my brows done
really bad that's my goal for tomorrow
is to get my brows done but BAM and this
is like hair that's regrowing in so it's
gonna look really bad but you'll be able
to get the point just oh my goodness
spoolie on the other side this is just
as good as any high-end eyebrow product
that I have ever used it's 10 bucks just
made it to my drugstore and I'm in love
I'm so in love with this eyebrow pencil
it's not too creamy it doesn't get stuck
in the eyebrows it's not too dry where
you feel you have to rub your eye your
eyebrow like L'Oreal knocked it out of
the park with this product out of the
park
so excited yes then we're gonna for a
new brow product definitely recommend
checking that out alright let me go back
to the collective brain uh alright I'm
so excited it's not waxy it's it's like
perfect like I don't know how to
describe it it's just perfect
it doesn't make like you know when you
put something in your brows and it feels
like it's like stick sticky or thick or
it makes your eyebrows feel like they're
gluing together it doesn't do that but
then it doesn't it's not so dry that you
feel like you have to rub it's that
in-between it just applies flawlessly
like a flawless flawless application let
me see okay
I got a little bit of room here I don't
know if you can see that but that's just
the tiny size bit this is dark brown by
the way and it just it's perfect that's
all I have to say about it just perfect
ages though before I give a full full
review sniffs honey says essence jumbo
eye liner pens are awesome and then pink
rose says hey pink rose hi pink rose
says like a BH brow tinted gel
oh okay I've never tried the tinted one
though a regular one is too crunchy for
me I've heard the next one is great - KJ
I have that one but it is the it's the
wrong shade for me so I need to get the
right shade everybody's saying the NYX
is amazing and then the Too Faced
bulletproof nicole says is her favorite
Gina says the anasazi beverly hills
dipbrow oh I would say that one but only
if you are an experienced brow product
user I feel like that was a little
difficult to use but if you can get it
and you like instagrammy brows yes
definitely definitely all right yeah
there's a lot of people that we have a
able to people can participate on mobile
now which is wonderful
hi Ellen and then Brittany says the
first brow product I ever bought was the
Anasazi Beverly Hill brow is and I've
never tried anything else almost
convinced to get the L'Oreal one now I
would recommend when you run out of your
row is to try to Lauri out but get it
from Walmart or someplace where you know
you can return that just in case but I
really think that you're going to love
it I genuinely think
going to love it or else I would not say
that all right let's move on because
we're gonna run out of time
you guys know my holy girl eyeliner you
already know what it is it's the
Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner um this
one I think will forever be my Holy
Grail
it doesn't seep into fine lines unless
all day it's seven bucks on the Jessie's
for a website they sell all kinds of
colors now the colors I feel like aren't
quite as good as the black I feel like
they don't last quite as long as the
black but they're still great they're
still great but they just don't look
like that the product I think dry seems
to dry up a little bit faster at least
in my experience for the for that but
yes we have not done lips yet you have
not Sun lips I got I got a stack of lips
over here but yes Jessie's Girl
absolutely
for drugstore if you're in the drugstore
the Maybelline um Maybelline went out of
my head told you sweat on my head you
ever get that moment where it's like
crickets in your head and it's like
crickets
Maybelline um Kaneesha says I love the
Jordana liquid liner and the black
radiance liquid liner the Judea one was
difficult for me to use and I didn't
feel like it was opaque it was weird I
don't know it didn't work very well for
me I don't know what happened cuz a lot
of people really really loved that um
Kay says the Stila stay all day done
that's a really good one
the the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper is awesome Michelle brand all
the essence gel liner is amazing it's
wonderful definitely recommend that one
totally totally totally the infallible
one I have not tried that one yet um
Stephanie says I just got the laura
mercier cake eyeliner I've never heard
anybody talk about cake eyeliners but
I'm loving it for tightlining my eyes
without taking up lid space on my small
lids and then Brittany says Jessie's
girls so great got a group on that was 2
for 10 and once and then she never went
back so if you can find the Jessie's
Girl ones absolutely alright I got to
keep moving or else rock and get through
all this stuff
okay so let's go ahead and go onto
mascara I have a few for you there's so
many good liquid eyeliners and my seamed
liquid eyeliner is Hanna's holy grail I
think that was Hanna I went by really
really fast
to have this Tabitha which mine Davis
says gel eyeliners are the only liner
that doesn't bother her eyes and then
Carrie says infallible is pretty amazing
it lasts all day and I trust Carrie 100
and a bazillion percent alright so some
mascaras really quickly the essence
mascaras overall I've really been loving
I've heard that these flake on some
people they do not flake on me this is
the last princess I think this is the
waterproof one but I really like it and
then the I heart extreme one this one's
a little more clump video
it's a little more volumizing this one's
a little more lengthening and a little
less company and then this one the
Jordana best lash extreme is another
amazing one looks very very ordinary but
it's not it's amazing this is the third
time I've gotten one so good so good
well the first one Victoria Donnell
descent to me but then I've gotten too
since then so wonderful so wonderful and
these are super super cheap these are
under $5 each for high-end mascaras
we're talking about the perversion by
Urban Decay this one is another one that
I feel like universally people seem to
love and then this one's a new one this
is still a huge extreme lash mascara
this may be one of the best mascaras
I've ever used and it's weird because
seal it doesn't usually blow me away
like ever like I can't remember the last
time I was like yeah you know like this
totally caught me off guard totally
caught me off guard Terri Lee says lash
princesses she loves it thanks to me
recommending it that's so awesome
dawn says the super sizer a lot of
people are loving the covergirl super
sizer
I completely agree I have not tried it
and Christus says the same thing that
the supersize are absolutely
Stephanie says the Maybelline lash
sensational forever and always and I've
seen a couple of people say the better
than sex mascara I found that to be kind
of clumpy on me but it is a nice mascara
it just I don't know it's kind of clumpy
I don't know why the roller lash is
another one that people talk about a lot
the roller lash feels heavy on my
eyelashes for some reason which
really like the performance is good but
it feels happy I don't know but these
are all really really really wonderful
mascaras and honestly I'm not sure if
the price difference is worth it for
these high-end mascaras when you can get
something that's this good for under
five bucks it's another one of those
things you don't have to spend a
ridiculous amount of money to get really
good products it's it's you know when
you buy a car you're you you get what
you pay for you know you get all the
features you get all the bells and
whistles you get the you know GPS system
and then the brakes and this some of
that and the sunroof and then whatever
but for me I don't think that's
necessarily true I don't necessarily
think that the best makeup has to be the
most expensive definitely not it's just
waiting through all the junk to find the
great stuff and this is some of the
great stuff so I've done we've all done
in the collective bringing the waiting
for you and now so there you go melody
says the better than sex doesn't stay on
her lashes and it crumbles off oh wow
and as summer says are there good
cruelty free drugstore mascaras and
honestly I'm not sure of the different
cruelty free drugstore brands that I
don't know off the top of my head or
else I would help oh hello hello and my
favorite people um Helen says eyeshadow
is something I get hi I am but mascara
is drugstore all the way and I feel like
overall eyeshadow seems to perform
better when you buy when you pay more
for it
overall exception you know the
wet-and-wild palettes the this would be
an exception to that rule
definitely okay let's move on cuz where
I got there's so much to tell you so
much to tell you okay so let's go into
lips because I know a lot of people have
been excited about lips okay a few
different products for you one thing I
wanted to show you are the colour-pop
lippie stix now these work really well
for me really really well for me but for
some reason there's some AE on these and
I don't really understand why I don't
get why some people don't like these why
they're perfect for me I'm one that I've
really been loving lately is grunge
that's the one I'm wearing in the show
today and how
really love its brunch I love it and
then I bound in Lumiere those are some
other ones that I really liked me and my
wife and start over here see if I can
get some space for some lips Walter's
okay so we're gonna do Lumiere this is
the kathleenlights one but that has
nothing to do with why I love it I
promise
I don't know Kathleen Kathleen doesn't
know me so there you go and then this is
bound just slightly kind of a brighter
pink and then here's brunch and these
are five bucks each there's garage it's
that new brownie kind of trends I really
like it a lot I love it okay cam says
colour-pop contempo is her favorite so
yes so yes for those accessible I really
love the Revlon these thingies any of
these balmy kinds of things these are
the matte bombs this is my favorite
formula of them except for the original
formula I love the shade adore because I
love those pinky nudes
but um this one is called elusive and
these are just a really nice one on just
a very very nice formula and then this
one is called sultry this one is
probably my most used one of this
formula and they don't feel drying they
feel actually very good on the lips
considering their own matte formula they
feel very very good lasting power is
pretty typical it's not you know stellar
or anything but I really enjoy these if
you're looking for something in the
drugstore all of these are wonderful
this formula and then for higher ends I
wanted to show you the two-faced
two-faced la creme formula is my
favorite this one is a new one in sugar
daddy really like this shade a lot
they're just really creamy and smooth
they just feel really good on the lips
really really good I have some
higher-end lipsticks that I would say
are really really good but the price
point I don't think I don't think
they're worth the price point unless you
just want to feel fancy because you want
to be able to say you have a higher-end
SiC like I do I just want it you know
Iona Charlotte Tilbury lipstick because
it makes me feel fancy it's all
completely placebo effect there I mean
these are just as good you know the
two-faced ones if I try to block out you
know the fanciness of it but I love
these look problems I love these things
so much Pam says the Kat Von D studded
lipsticks are a big favorite of hers and
Savi says the same thing nikki says bite
Beauty has an amazing amazing lipstick
formula that's very very true and Cheryl
says the buxom lipsticks are nice too
Savi says a la creme lipsticks keep
melting Oh No and Gina says the clinic
pop lipsticks she really likes and then
Elodie says yes the of mattes I love
it's going very fast lisa says I have
for Urban Decay lipsticks and never
reach for them I have a bunch of urban
decay lipsticks too and I don't reach
for them either I don't know why I don't
know why I don't just they don't they
don't call to me I don't know why and
then KJ says I want unicorn tears now
that if I showed it unicorn tears is a
really fun shade look it up if you're
curious it's very interesting it's like
a topper they don't advertise it it's a
topper but it's a topper and that summer
says the Too Faced melted fig and
Rainbow or her favorite stuff says
they're stupid expensive but Marc Jacobs
lipsticks they're never sticky unless
forever agreed absolutely agreed nikki
says the clinic pops are really good and
Kay says we need a luxury feeling fancy
chat I didn't have enough fancy stuff I
don't think I have enough really fancy
stuff to do a fancy job blinkie's lerp
says the julep it's whipped lipstick and
then tabatha which mom Davis says Milani
matte lipsticks are great I would see
Andrea says the Urban Decay formula is
um is amazing I do really like it I
don't know why I don't grab for them and
Kaylee says I need that Maybelline touch
of spice you speak up oh it's a good one
it's a good one
as far as glosses my favorite gloss
formula is the NYX butter glosses I have
these things they have just the time a
bit of pigmentation so it's nice for you
know those people that don't like that
heavy lip color and in they smell good
they feel good they laugh the typical
now it's hard
amazing as far as lasting power but
they're very nice they're nice little
glosses and I really like them a lot I
love them a lot oh my goodness are we
all seriously almost at its own UK me
all right
I got a hurry up okay I don't wanna like
not tell you things so I might stay on a
couple extra minutes all right
this is a new purchase for me this is
really really fun and where did I show
this did I show this oh I showed this on
put this Oh

based primer I don't know if you can see
that but it comes out like a silicon
based primer and then when you put it on
top but can you see the gloss on the air
I hopefully can see the gloss and then
when I put that over top hopefully you
can see it turns it matte it's such a
neat neat product really needs and it
doesn't feel mad you still have that
mushy like you know moisturized feeling
really really fun very fun so I'm really
excited to play with this some more I
just I'm so blown away by this so blown
away that hey I did want to talk about
some nail polishes very quickly because
I know some people love nail polishes my
favorite nail polish for know to be
honest with you is julep I love jewel
nail polishes I would never pay $14 for
one so I mean I own so many because I
have a julep subscription shake them up
a little bit I have a jewel subscription
that's why I have so many but they're
seriously my favorite formula and the
reason why they're my favorite formula
is they last on the nails for a really
really long time and my nail polish
chips really really fast on me but julep
nail polishes most of them take a really
long time to chip on me this has been on
my nail since Thursday and there's
there's a couple little chips in the
tips but it's not enough to have to take
it off
and it's Sunday and it looks amazing
like what what and they consistently do
that they're also one to two coat
polishes they dry relatively quickly I
mean it's just and the the more they're
around I feel like they keep improving
the formula like I feel like my newest
julep nail polishes are better formula
than my older julep polishes Tara Lee
says that julep brushes are excellent
they are they are very very nice if you
don't have a jewel of subscription I
definitely would recommend checking into
it because the great thing about a
jeweler subscription is it it's usually
good at keeping track of things or you
have an alarm I woke up like a thing on
your phone where it can run like a
reminder you can skip your bag so if you
don't want to get your box or bag
wherever you want to call it in a month
you can just skip it and it works really
really well to do that because then you
just get it whenever it calls to you and
then you don't get it when it doesn't
call to you what I'm wearing on my lip
my minute lips my nails today is called
thali and it's one of their liquid
holographics and I really love this it's
just so gorgeous in the sunlight it just
glows it's so so so pretty another
sample others you know it's shades that
I kind of picked it out because of the
Pantone color of the year this is
Paulette and it is so beautiful I have
it here on the nail swatch it's right
here it's so beautiful and then this one
is called Jean this one's so pretty
and these have no top coats nothing oh
my goodness till this description is $20
a month I think and you get two to three
nail polishes you get two nail polishes
then you get a skincare or a makeup item
along with it
yes or if you want to try to look nail
polishes once a month they have a
mystery box there's $25 they send you a
bunch of mystery things which i think is
totally worth it the value that you get
in those things are like over $100 and
it cost $25 if you want to try julep I'd
recommend getting one of those mystery
boxes first and see if you like it and
then subscribe to the subscription if
you want to I do have a code you know
how you get those codes you know when
you subscribe to something that you get
referral whatever referral credits the
referral credit system now is totaled
like you get $15 but you can only use
the $15 like one time like you can't add
them up so it's like really annoying so
I don't really like the points like if
you want to click below that's fine if
not don't worry about it like just go to
chew up and sign up so anyway the soft
focus finish is another one that I
really like as far as formula from these
and I have the swatch will go I had it
out hold on I have it I want to show it
to you this is not it this is not it
this is not it this is not it I got out
all my swatch wheels is this it stuck
yes no hmm but it's like a satiny kind
of finish instead of a like a glossy
finish it's like satin
it looks very flat and like um creamy on
the nails so it's very very nice and
this one again is called Janet and I
really like that a lot so julep nail
polishes yes
I'm invited to pick one from the
drugstore that I really like I really
like where are they oh I'm trying to
find one my eyes are falling on one st
is not a huge win for me just so you
know st is not a huge wedding I have a
blue Sally Hansen insta-dry okay I was
trying to find one but for some reason I
can't my eyeballs are not falling on one
Sally Hansen insta-dry I really like the
only thing is selling Hansen is too dry
will crack like crackle after a few days
so just be aware of that
okay Jay says every blue nail polish on
the planet is an addiction
yes so when I met what happened oh um
Zoe is a great formula and Nicki I do
like Zoe abut so he has been hit and
miss for me I feel like julep is more
consistent at least for me personally
krishna says not a fan of the Pantone
colors was hoping for another jewel tone
really like the marsala the marsala made
me happy the gold-digger says loving Zoi
and julep and then Shannon says Essie is
very hit-or-miss for me summer also and
summer horrible agreed agreed and
stephanie says sally hansen complete
salon manicure agreed
another great formula everyone small
that one disappoints me too
but everyone small julep comes out with
one where i'm kind of like but it's very
rare that there's a julep one that I
don't like alright I gotta get going
