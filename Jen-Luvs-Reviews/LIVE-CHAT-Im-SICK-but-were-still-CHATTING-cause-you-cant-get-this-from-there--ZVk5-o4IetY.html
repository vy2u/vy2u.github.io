a makeup chat I'm alone not feeling that
great today last night I took some cold
medicine and not like this but like
maybe 2:30 in the morning I think it's
still like working so my face doesn't
feel as bad as it did but like I've got
that like I'm cold
and then I'm hot and then I'm cold and
then I'm hot like right now I'm hot but
a minute ago I was cold so I'm still
gonna hang out anyway though because I
would miss you if we didn't hang out
today cuz I like hanging out with you
it's fun I have my mic on way down there
but for the past few chats Oh my voice
is cracking for the past few chats the
microphone hasn't worked so I did
something a little bit different and I'm
hoping it works because there's no way
for me to tell if it's working until I
watch something on the replay and
honestly I was gonna test them this week
and I just I was like both my kids are
sick like my daughter is coming out of
it like she hasn't had a fever for 24
hours but she still has a call and my
son's like deep in the middle of it
right now
so but anyway I wanted to chat anyway
and I wanted to say hi to the collective
brain but before we do I do want to do
my disclaimer because every time I don't
do this clamor I have people in the
comments saying I really don't like live
chat I'm really sorry if you don't like
live chat this is the thing I can only
edit so many videos in week my videos
are very labor intensive like every word
you see on the screen every picture that
comes in every cut every fade all of
that takes time so my videos take a long
time to produce and I'm at like max
speed right now on video production so a
way that I can get you extra content is
through live streams basically if a live
stream is happening it's because other
content can't be happening and I've been
doing a live chat for like 4 years and I
love live chat I love talking in the
community and I love sharing extra fun
stuff with you and I do have some fun
stuff that I brought over on the table
with me today to share with you and I
got
yar so you know I figure we just kind of
chat and hang out today and be sick
because you can't catch what I've got
from where you're at so that's a good
thing I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going
to say hello to the people that are here
sorry I'm like itching my eyes like my
eyes are so edgy it's like okay let me
say hello to the people that got here
first scroll all the way up
Teresa mo in the house saucer jazz is
here Teresa thank you for being here and
just thank you for being here liz is
here thank you so much for the
well-wishes latina and Julio down by the
schoolyard are here yay denise is here
Georgia Kate here Sydney and amber I'm
like calling the roll in school all of a
sudden Steph is here and they Dean and
AJ thank you guys so much for being here
Rebecca and Amanda and Michelle the
fabulous Consuelo Julie LR and Georgia
Harris in the house everybody else that
I didn't say hello - hello - welcome to
live chat I'm so thankful that you're
not actually here because I don't want
to get you sick so you know I've got
people kind of freaking out in chat
because the people that are here and
chatted people that like live chats
they're like freaking out some people
just don't like me going back and forth
and talking to the community it's kind
of scattered people like a let's some
people really like a linear format and
live chat is not linear it's like me
popping off all over the place but I
like live chat and I've heard a lot of
people really enjoy listening to this
kind of like a podcast so that's kind of
cool I really like that a lot so let's
go ahead and start off with a brand that
I've been kind of sitting on for a
little while but I wanna I want to talk
to you about a little bit but I haven't
fully listened my voice I haven't fully
tried these yet I kept him in here
because the boxes were like super
cumbersome they were like you know
everything was in their own little boxes
so I put things in here I know that
doesn't look super cool but I had to
learn I have learned since I talked
about that I got these I've learned a
lot about China and Hong Kong and that
there is a huge difference between
regular like I guess it's called
mainland China and Hong Kong
these were made in Hong Kong and this is
called pop star cosmetics they have
these liquid lipsticks the big thing
about the liquid lipstick so far is that
they are really really really bright and
bold shades which is not my personal
taste so I'm I haven't tested them as
much as I've wanted to I need to just
one day when I'm home just put one of
these crazy colors on and just enjoy so
they've got all these shades here the
nudie ones the pinky one well no no I
mean nude because nobody's this color
but the pink ones are probably the
closest to my color they're not even
nudes i don't know why i'm calling them
nudes Yunus and Utah are probably the
closest ones let me swatch them for you
but this is an indie brand I mean
they're they're packaging is really
pretty and I do believe that they are
cruelty free which is super cool let me
swatch these for you of course things
are dropping but this might be good for
people that really like bold colors some
of these other ones I show you but I
realize you know it's so funny because
there's so much to learn out there in
this world and you can't possibly know
everything in this world and that was my
ignorance you know with you know mainly
in China and Hong Kong and trying to
learn the differences between them it's
it's a big difference okay so the first
one is Utah and the second one is Eunice
Utah is a little bit more Eunice is a
little more Mavi I guess you could say
where this one is a little bit more
bright they have where these sold if
your soul wants to know they have a
website I believe it's pop star
cosmetics calm let me go and make sure
that it's there before I say that pop
star cosmetics pop star cosmetics yep
pop star cosmetics calm they have the
velvet matte liquid lipsticks these are
their $18 each and they have all of the
shades there let me swatch some of the
brighter ones for those of you that
really like these like this one is
called a KO this one is a bright bright
red I'll let you know in a minute
whether they dry down
that's a KO and then let's do one of
these other ones this one is like a
corally pink this one is called Kazumi
but these shades are so so so bright I
do want to do a full review on them
though I really like to I'm hoping that
I can squeeze them in and do lip
swatches and stuff they also have these
right here stuff just rolling everywhere
I don't even care right now this is
called mesmerized and let me find the
description on these real quick for you
these are really really pretty I did
wear these on my eyes a couple of times
and they're really beautiful they're on
a second
the mesmerised mousse eyeshadows this
one is English aid hypnotized
they remind me a lot of this steal us
but not quite as glittery they're not
quite as chunky as the steal us
mesmerized mousse eyeshadows and these
are $19 as well they have four different
shades of these I used the shade I
believe and trap on my eyes before but
this hypnotized one is gorgeous I would
think in the tube it would be a little
darker but it's like this beautiful like
deeper champagne and I just put this all
over my lid and it was absolutely
gorgeous oh here we go here's two more
shades so this is entrap and be witch so
this is entrap and they're just they're
really pretty if you want an alternative
something different to those those steal
up shadows but again they're they're
different in that the steal of ones I
feel like are a little a little more
glittery so those are those two right
there the gray one is bewitch and though
like gold or one is called in trap but
yeah they're really really pretty so
yeah those are some highlights they also
have I haven't used this at all this is
called the start whale it's a makeup
remover I haven't used that at all it's
a spray and you spray it on your face
and it's helps you to remove your makeup
which i think is pretty cool because I
always get a lot of whenever I
make up or put on skincare or anything
in uh on live people are like Chad why
are you rubbing your face so much but I
would imagine like you know spraying
something like that um I guess you stuff
to rub it to get it off but I don't know
what I'm thinking I'm sick I blame it on
being sick I've got a big mess on my
floor and everything right off I'll pick
them up in a minute
all right but I can't spend my whole
chat I'm just picking things up I'm
gonna go over to the chat and see what
people are saying how's the lasting
power on the shadows good really good
um they dry down like hard they dried
out hard like right now they're still
drying down let me show you the the
matte liquid lipstick see this one's
been on my hand for a while actually I'm
just gonna put suck it up and put one on
and that way I can give you more
information I'm not gonna put on a crazy
one though I'm just gonna grab is my mic
working by the way mom for 20 love
beauty want stuff my beanies from fat
bit fun yes it is and I love this be
mean okay I can't see what I'm doing I
don't have a mirror I am so not prepared
I'm sorry but do I have any kind of
mirror in this other box did they give
me any kind of Mir no none of these
products have a mirror I'm gonna have to
get up and get a mirror
oh there's one I'm sorry you guys okay
hopefully the mic is working so good
yeah hey I fixed the problem okay let me
put this on and we'll talk about dry
down and everything even though it's
gonna look really weird the dough foots
a typical dough foot I saw toothpaste
right there did you mess okay right now
it feels very comfortable
it doesn't feel sticky in any way but
we'll see what happens
cuz I forgot it's been a minute since I
tried one of these I do want to give you
a full review of these cuz I mean these
first impression reviews are kind of
junk but I don't know it's kind of
pretty this one is the one that's called
Utah I think this would be really pretty
in a spring with like a like almost like
a
like a like a nude eye because it's kind
of a more calm kind of shade I'm talking
about why did I even come on shot I'm
gonna sound like a idiot the whole time
it's all good though
so right now see my lips are not
sticking together look at that bam bam
it's looking good it's looking good
it doesn't fit feels it feels dry it
doesn't feel like crackling dry yet
we're gonna give it some time now now as
far as these eye shadows
oh that's smearing I thought I remember
them drying down really well but that
when I put on more recently but this one
is not like I'm rubbing it a little bits
coming off of my finger but not too much
but I remember them drying down really
well on the eyes I'm gonna end up with
this crazy look all right let's do this
let's just do no you know what I'm not
gonna waste my eyes I have it on my hand
cuz I've got other stuff to show you -
I'm gonna say we'll just do like some
crazy makeup look but like doesn't even
make any sense just to try this stuff
out Amy says if it's a virus it won't
live that long
outside the body well that's good
Cynthia said looks like the pic but wait
looks like the are picking up on the
colors of Utah's national parks of Zion
oh maybe maybe we went to Zion two years
ago we're gonna go this summer again I
think we're gonna try at least I've got
a mix of coffee and water over here
alright so other things I've gotten for
PR this right here I don't know why I'm
so excited about this I think it's like
in my head I think Britney Spears knows
who I am even though I'd know that she
doesn't know who I am I used to be a
huge Britney Spears fan and this showed
up my Britney Spears PR team sent this
to me and I was like what like somehow
having some random connection to Britney
Spears like I don't fangirl that often
but like
fact that her PR team found me I thought
was super super cool this is her new
fragrance it is called summer fantasy I
have think they're I think if one or two
of her other one
in my perfume collection I try not to
buy full-size perfumes because I have a
tun tun tun tun tun of semper vials so I
don't need perfume really but this is
amazing this is absolutely amazing Gina
says ion is from the Bible yes it is
that is very true so this is very sugary
sweet very sugary sweet if you like that
if you like really sugary sweet scent I
think you'll really like it if you like
something that's a little more like you
if you think that sugary sweet scents
are immature you don't want to pop it
but I've been wearing this a lot it's
just it's just very fun and playful and
feminine and I would say it's more it's
very very sweet almost reminds me of
like a bath and body works kind of like
spray you know any mean like it's very
very very sweet so if you like that you
might want to look into that because I
personally sometimes I'm going to move
for that sometimes in the mood for you
know something a little bit more mature
you know as far as the scent goes but
but yeah I really like this a lot I'm
excited about it I don't know I'm
fangirling a little bit alright go back
to the water I didn't get I haven't
gotten a whole ton of PR lately so but I
figured I wouldn't show you stuff at
least says that bottle is huge I know I
know it's huge
I'm never going to go through this whole
thing I don't think to share it with
Lila when she turns 13 Ashley wants to
know if my husband likes us Melanie yeah
he does he definitely does he likes
sweeter since anyway though
hey J it's like a lifetime supply of
perfume I know right
well I've been using it quite a bit I
got it what two weeks ago I'm using
quite a bit and I'm like yeah I'm making
a little dent in it so I'm really really
excited about this because you guys know
I did that video with collab makeup not
with cloud makeup but I did I bought a
bunch of makeup from the collab brand
which was it sold its Ally beauty and
it's drugstore priced it was me
in collaboration with a bunch of
influencers and I was really excited for
it so I bought some things that coffee
break with Danny I had requests
requested I had recommended
sorry guys I'm losing it coffee freak
with Danny had recommended different
things she's no longer with the program
she announced in a video that she's no
longer working with collab I wonder what
happened I don't even know but but I
tried a bunch of things and I liked
everything there were certain things I
liked better than others you can just
type in youtube search Jen loves reviews
collab and you'll find it but there was
only the mascara I didn't I don't I
don't use the mascara anymore because
it's really hard to take off and that
bothers me so you know I don't use that
anymore but everything else I really
liked especially the lipsticks the
lipsticks we're like stand out awesome
so collab sent me PR box which I was
super excited and thankful to see little
cards coming on it shows all their cute
little faces so it's got like Lizzie
from what with Lizzie do and sammich and
who else in your Leisha from ex Park
edge I mean these are people that I've
been watching for years oh geez
of YouTube there's no other people that
I wasn't familiar with before this but
but yeah so there's like the prices and
everything on the back of the card I
feel like this is this is what I wish
that all brands would send with PR is
kind of a breakdown to the products with
all of the names and the prices because
that's really really valuable cuz I
usually have to look all that stuff up
which is super nice Oh Tiffany dawn is
here
check out Tiffany Dawn's YouTube channel
she's awesome
welcome Tiffany dawn okay so Oh Briana
grim is here she says yeah I finally
caught you live yay
happy to have you here my 420 love
beauty says Danny I believe talked about
why did she talk about why she left I
thought she just said she left I don't
know I didn't I don't think I watched
the whole video I'm collab is sold at
Sally Beauty AJ so these I don't know if
this is from like it doesn't say whether
this is part of like a new like their
spring because I know they're supposed
be coming out with another like launch
of stuff so I don't know if this is part
of their first launcher that this is a
second launch but I would love to do a
full video on
as well so the first thing I'm going to
show you is this is the soft spot shear
blush and it's called just for fun is
the shade here this is made by Sally
Beauty so that's the only place you can
get it I bought my stuff when I bought
it was at Sally Beauty online because my
Sally Beauty isn't super close I love
that they have the little sticker on the
outside but I was really surprised
because like I tried the Sally girl
stuff and I was not impressed with the
Sally girl stuff
my stomach started to because I think
it's because of the talking I think it's
messing me up okay we need to block this
burnt mmm I can't do it I don't even
know hide user on this channel there you
go okay
I got the creeper okay so anyway this is
the blush and I'm just gonna do a little
this looks like this was meant for
somebody my skin tone or lighter it's a
very very light but I don't have any
brush cuz I'm just gonna put it on old
school style I used to put on my blush
like this hey if it works and you won't
have any brushes cuz you eating off
ramen noodles that's the way I always
put on my blush when I was in college
doesn't look that bad does it it's very
light though but it's pretty very pretty
but we're gonna do a full hopefully do a
full review I don't like to promise
anything cuz things had things changing
all that rock and Robin says drinks and
peppermint tea I should I don't think I
have any peppermint tea I'd have to make
my husband go get it
Oh Aspen says I can go if I'm feeling
sick it's okay I'm gonna push through it
would be alright we got 36 minutes I'll
be alright
well no 40 41 minutes we'll be alright
I'll be okay I'll make it I'm tough I
got this I went to work like when I was
waiting tables I'd go to work like with
really bad coals and stuff like I
wouldn't go to work like sick sick but
if I could functionally function I would
go to work like I was never one to like
stay home and I would just try to stay
away from people as best as possible
mostly because I needed
[Laughter]
all right this is a multitasking face
brush which I would imagine this would
be good let's see what does it say it's
four it says it's for bronzer blush
highlighter and finishing powder I
probably would I would not use this for
finishing powder it's too small for a
finishing powder for me personally but
you can use it for yeah I could it's
done it's got a really nice dome to it
it's very soft it's very not super dense
I was gonna say it's very dense but it's
not very dense it's little dense denser
than some of the blush brushes I have
but it's really soft what's the price on
this thing this is 1199 that's not bad
for a face brush like this that's not
bad at all
I like that I should have used that with
the blush I'm at like that I'm out of it
okay we got this we got this and put the
packaging over there okay next up I got
another lipstick which I'm really
excited about this is still pretty
comfortable it looks like it's crackling
a little bit like it's not real super
smooth looking if you could see that but
it's it's um it's still pretty
comfortable though like I doesn't feel
like my lips are just you know the
Saharan okay this is called yes ma'am
yeah their lipsticks do not have a scent
see if I can I'm just gonna put it here
that is really pretty
that's really pretty this must be one
they have two different finishes there's
a matte finish and then there's I
believe they call it a satin finish I
think this is one of the satin finish
ones
Monique says your hands are the cheapest
brushes ain't that the truth ain't that
the truth but that's a really pretty
shade it's a little more peachy Susan
says don't forget the but forgo the
power of the hot toddy I don't even know
if I have ingredients for hot toddy I've
heard good things about hot toddies
though all right now we've got liquid
lipstick from collab this is in the
shade blood rush look at that thing oh
my gosh okay the liquid lipstick is six
day of 16 shades eight matte finish
eight set and finish there $10.99 that
the mattes full coverage and the
that is buildable coverage let's put
these next to the pop was it pop pop
star cosmetics to put it next to that
over top of the blush watch I'm actually
very surprised at how comfortable this
pop star cosmetics is I mean it's not
it's similar to like dose of colors
level of comfort where it's dry down so
it's I can feel that it's dry on my lips
but it's not like sucking the life out
of my lips and my lips don't feel like
they're crackling but I wouldn't need a
full wear test a full II recommend it to
you so there's a collab down there it's
really pretty but I really do feel like
they put a lot of heart into this line I
mean I think that they needed to I think
that you know Sally beauty is not known
for their high quality makeup coming
from their brand so I think that they're
like really putting their love into it
trying to get the stuff to be really
awesome which i think is great
yeah these eyeshadows are dried down now
and these pop star ones are dried down I
remember them drying down pretty fast on
the eyes though a little bit of glitter
coming off of my finger there area Susan
says hot Tottie comfy blanket Netflix
couch heaven I have a video needs to go
up tomorrow it's mostly edited though so
hopefully I can finish that without too
much trouble okay this is called collab
oh wait duh did I really just say that
really really Jen Monica says awfully
I've only ever heard of Sally beauty for
like hair products had no idea they were
doing makeup - yeah they've been doing
makeup for a while but they did had that
Sally girl brand and it was not good it
was not good
okay glitter and go lip pigment a lip
pigment really ooh what in the world I
was not expecting that
okay so mesmerizing sparkling lip
pigment powder to wear alone with your
favorite collab lip color
it's no way dude okay that is really
messy though I am NOT a fan of this
packaging okay let's put my try to put
my see I'm trying to put my whole finger
over the top I wish that they had made
the opening smaller the opening should
be smaller because some people their
finger may not go all the way over and
like my finger is barely reaching the
edges and I'm scared that it's gonna
slip out like how is this supposed to be
functionally supposed to come out you
know
GG's tried everybody's talking about the
tart drama I want to try to stay away
from the tart drama today I talked about
it so much on Twitter yesterday if you
want to know anything about how I'm
feeling about the tart drama go look and
see all my stuff I posted yesterday on
the Twitter's that's where it goes down
is the Twitter man you're not on Twitter
it's like the hidden I'm gonna put this
on over top and I'm gonna put this lip
pigment stuff on top of it it's like the
hidden social media it's seriously like
the best place to connect with people
because there aren't that many people on
it
all right that's really super hydrating
my lips feel like all gunky now too much
all right Robin wants to know what a
q-tip work for that maybe oh no my
q-tips are kind of far away let's try to
put this on whoa that's pretty icy now I
feel like I got to get some more with
this packaging is no good Aspen says Jen
is awesome on Twitter seriously everyone
should follow
it's like Jen unfiltered on Twitter I
started putting on Twitter unlisted
videos like bloopers and stuff that's
really pretty and it's um it's not super
chunky glitter can you guys see that Oh
Gina says what tart drama girl girl so
much tart drama with the shape tape
foundation so much going on
lots and lots hopefully you guys can see
that let me get a little closer because
it looks like it's definitely not
representing true to color on screen on
screen this is so much deeper than what
you're seeing I mean in real life it's
so much deeper than what you're seeing
it looks really really really weird on
camera it is like a completely different
color to me then on the camera I need to
get a different camera because the color
is it's like it looks like dirt like
what you're seeing looks like absolute
dirt it doesn't look like that at all
for me like the the color representation
is way off I that is just debts
convinced me I need to get a new webcam
you
you are not you're seeing like peach
this is not peach this is like a like a
berry color oh my gosh yeah that makes
me no happy no happy Jen not happy makes
me not happy not no happy can I even
speak alright where is my I got to wipe
this off because this doesn't it looks
like dirt to you it doesn't look like
that to me it looks so much better in
real life than it does on the camera
alright hold on a second I'm gonna
unplug my microphone real quick and go
get something to wipe this off all right
sorry if it's loud for a second I'm
gonna set the microphone down
okay I'm coming back okay
hopefully that's better it looks like a
berry to Lorraine well maybe it's just
um maybe it's just the way that looks on
my my replay I don't know but it looked
really weird yes I have Falkor on my
back yes I do
my Falkor is so old it was the first big
tattoo my husband did on me
I have Falkor on my back and then I've
got this is the owl from the neverending
story and I never enjoy this is never
any story this is the owl from labyrinth
you know in the beginning of the movie
how it's got the big owl that flies
through this is the owl we got it off
the box from from which call it from the
movie like from the DVD box or whatever
the owl and then Falkor they're really
old though
they're like all faded and everything
because they're they're really old and I
didn't take good care of them like all
the color is completely out of the owl
these things used to be gorgeous it used
to be so gorgeous and I didn't take good
care of them so I've got lots of tattoos
are all over my back Falkor is from a
movie called the neverending story you
have to you have to google it I can't
explain the whole neverending story
because it's just it's a lot to explain
but it's so good it's so good it was
movie I watched when I was a kid so
anyway because I love stories Susan said
Jan you're cool quotient just went up
Thanks I know people look at this and
like P if you've never seen a
neverending story and you see this
tattoo it's like what even is that it's
like a dog but it's like not a dog and
there's a kid on its back like what even
is that can you not says how are you
sick I don't know I have two kids that
are sick so you know anyway so we've got
I shadow palette I want to get a dark
crystal tattoo that's part of my plan I
wanted to get um Keira from the Dark
Crystal tattooed somewhere some kind of
cat Keira tattoo
I also wanted to get the little worm
from labyrinth I said I knew so he is a
luck dragon Vicki that's true alright
let's watch this one okay so watch this
one
Tracy says we're having coffee together
yes and we're sick together yeah I wish
you weren't sick with me my fingers just
dug into that look how pretty that is
this seriously like I have the purple
one I think I might like I think I'm
gonna like this one better than the
purple one that I bought the purple one
that I bought was good but it wasn't
great look how pretty that is in the
swatches we're definitely gonna have to
I'm just wiping it on my sweatpants oh
by some Nordic says I love Dark Crystal
I got the worm the worm on a tee oh cool
all right let me see hold on a minute
what did I just watch I don't even
remember once you what did I just watch
I don't even know what I just do okay I
think I swatch the first four so let's
do the second for I did him in like the
quads oh my gosh
he's serious well that one's kind of
weak that last ones but look at this one
so pretty Erin says you've totally
inspired an entire sleeve for me that
one is gorgeous this one's beautiful
this one's weak that last one that cream
shade at least in the swatch on the eye
it may be different again these are not
full reviews I don't know maybe it just
matches my skin tone blue says arriving
late hi from Japan hello hello hello
hello Sean is just getting here - what's
up Shauna Susan wants to know what
release I'm most looking forward to
coming up honestly like I was really
looking forward to the shape take
foundation I was I was my stomach just
started turning a little bit oh my gosh
come on Jen no more coffee drink water
I'm glad that medicine I took is still
working because I might nose fog was
gonna fall off last night all right
Stella says oh my god and eye shadow
swatch sleeve mine blown there you go
that'd be fun no I don't know I'm like
that'd be interesting because you like
an eyeshadow swatch Li but it wouldn't
like be metallic or anything like this
I'd be interesting Joanne says any
thoughts on the star palette by Natasha
- no no not really
Natasha - no no I feel like she still
makes things for makeup artists mostly
at least it feels like that kind of like
visi art and like the way that the setup
is sometimes I feel like is not like my
preference where I like having like the
complete palette thing where I could
just grab one palette and use it that's
just me
lavender roses Jim what about Princess
Bride I love that movie especially as a
kid she says he's rolling down the hill
yeah at the okay so this is a
highlighter it's called porosity and
when we talk about The Princess Bride on
my tattoo so my whole back was supposed
to be tattooed this was years and years
and years old at this point but I was
gonna get Cinderella's castle in the
middle like a castle in the middle and
then over on a hillside over on the side
was going to be the silhouette of Wesley
and Buttercup over on the side you know
how they're like sitting there like kind
of holding each other and like he's
standing there and then like she's got
her leg long hair going down and they're
like looking at each other like profile
why that was what was gonna be this is
not a good swatch cuz it's mixing with
the lipstick let me see if I can find
another spot here okay hmm okay
switching hands we're gonna put it over
here this is a liquid highlighter it's
really pretty but yeah so that was gonna
be on my back - I was trying to fit
everything in so there you go scientists
and makeup says I can't use just one
palette I always end up using three or
four palettes and you know what I feel
like my looks come out prettier when I
use different palettes when I get when I
can like confine myself to one palette I
feel like I'm not like my looks aren't
as pretty
but yeah that's really really pretty
it's like a champagne liquid highlighter
so if you like liquid highlighters this
one is let me see how much of this what
is going on I thought my whole thing was
I was losing the whole thing for a
second its $14.99 it comes in four
shades this one's called porosity okay
more water more water alright we've got
three more things from collab this is
the works wow effect all in one mascara
I'm a little scared to try this because
like I said the other mascara that I got
which I think was the length anyone it's
got a green stripe on it that one was
really difficult to remove but we're
gonna give this one a try this one is
just called the works what does it do
all-in-one effect mascara comes in three
shades it's $12.99 which is a little bit
pricey for a drugstore mascara I like my
drugstore mascaras to be like eight
bucks like ten bucks max for drugstore
mascara oh the last unicorn see my bliss
suit sewing it's a child of the eighties
here and so yes that'll last unicorn
I should fit the last unicorn in there
somewhere because I did watch that a lot
as a kid that one's a little creepy
though like I always had trouble with
the last unicorn it's a little creepy
like a creepy lady that's in it she's
really creepy but the last unicorn was
pretty amazing the one tattoo that I
have that no one's gonna get that I
don't show anybody because it's like
really close to my butt is the see
prints and the fire child it was an
anime cartoon that my dad rented for me
that I was obsessed with and then my dad
copied it for me so that I could keep it
because back then you had to like copy
the movies and it was like hard to find
to buy so he like copied it so I had
like a bootleg copy of I had a bootleg
copy of see prints and fire child and I
loved that movie it's like a Romeo and
Juliet story but like an anime thing and
it's really good I won't tell you the
whole story but it's really good if you
can ever get
and get your hands on so I have the C
prints unlike my butt like my hip my
butt so anyway let's show this mascara
this is why people don't like live chat
if I go off on tangents this wand I
really like I like ones like that where
it's like bubbled out on one side and
flat on the other side if you like gives
you options
you know Michelle says Jen somebody
obsessed with this hat and glasses look
on me oh thank you I like it too it was
like more like okay I brushed my hair my
hair looks flat and terrible let's just
bloody beating on but I'm excited to try
this formula let me see if it has like a
terrible sense sometimes mascaras have
terrible strong scent it just smells
like a mascara but it's not real strong
Kris says mama Fortuna was the creepy
witch on the last unicorn amazing novel
I haven't seen that movie in years I
should watch it again okay so we've got
two more products and they're both
liners so this is the bold face liner
waterproof eye lining a pencil and this
is six shades and they're $8.99 so let's
just kind of put it here feels very
creamy it's very black and I must know
if I watch any anime no I don't watch
any anime anymore
I had a neighbor when I was in college
when I lived by myself I had this little
bottom floor single bedroom apartment I
paid five fifty five a month for this
little apartment it was what I was
living in when I met John and my
neighbor across the hall was really into
anime so he got me watching a couple of
things but I had honestly I haven't
watched many things since I moved out
from there you know 15 years ago or
whatever Diana says I love the smell of
fresh mascara that is too funny
I'm not a big fan on that one but you
know everyone has their things that they
like and that's what makes the world go
around Jamie Jamie says The Last Unicorn
is on Netflix really gene is talking
about grease greased lightning I didn't
realize how dirty that movie was when I
was a kid Nicole is talking about The
Breakfast Club yes this is very creamy
it's very black the eyeliner let's go
back to makeup for a second oh it's not
smudging look at this
expecting it to be super smudgy look at
that that's so weird it's like not
smudging Wow but yeah you ever if you
watch the grease as an adult and realize
how dirty that movie is
oh it says twist I'm like going like
this and it says twist twist Jen it says
right there okay this is the killer coal
self sharpening I pencil and put that
one right next to it man these are so
creamy weird science oh my gosh I used
to watch that when I was a kid to which
I had no business watching I mean they
take a shower with her I had no business
watching these movies as a child but
that was a really good movie - I used to
watch that movie over and over and that
one and what was it was it real science
it had um Val Kilmer in it was it called
real science I think is what it was
called that one was really good - I just
remember like a giant vat of popcorn
it's like weird I don't even remember
anything else about that Steph says I've
always been disturbed by the fact that
Danny and Sandy don't land the car at
the end of grease like they just go
flying into the sky like nothing that's
a really good point Nicole hey yay or
nay Nicole yea or nay Nicole by the way
you need to go check out her channel her
channel is doing really really well
right now she's got some great videos up
you should go check out yay or nay
Nicole she's my good good good friend
and I'm so excited that her channel is
doing very well right now real genius
Thank You Elise thank you real science
real genius yes but I don't remember
anything about that movie other than
like this giant vat of popcorn thank you
everybody saying yet Oh cauliflower is
here too you should check out her
channel 2ch Oly flower she's very real
down to earth channel by the way I know
this is off topic but I'm just off topic
all over the place like most chats let's
see if this one yeah this one's not
really smudging either so if you like
smudgy eyeliners these are not for you
but if you like ones that dry down
they're creamy and then they just stay
so we
I'm working on a video where it's gonna
be a video accomplishing remember the
one that I did for people under was it
under 20000 subscribers I'm doing one
for people they're under like 5000
subscribers because if you don't know
the YouTube algorithm has chain and
algorithm the YouTube rules have changed
no more water and in order to be
monetized you have to have 4,000 hours
of watch time and you have to have at
least a thousand subscribers so I asked
my Twitter for people to post their
channels so that I could you know check
out some channels and I found some
really good Channel so I'm working on a
video for that hopefully I'll feel
better and be able to film I do have two
videos that I've already filmed that I
just need to edit so that would be like
Friday's video if I can film it if I'm
not feeling too terrible the other
recommendation was cauliflower ch Oly
and then flour just really good and it's
so funny because when I watch channels
that have a smaller sub count it really
reminds me a lot of the way YouTube used
to be where it's like they're hanging
out with like a buddy you know and just
chat and make up you know and it just
it's been so enjoyable watching some of
these smaller youtube channels and just
taking it back you know taking it back
old school before it was everything was
all polished and perfect all the time
you know it's just something something
real about the core of YouTube when we
were all just with our crappy cameras
just sitting there like just talking and
just putting our heart out there you
know and now like you have to be so
careful with every single little thing
you say and you have to be so perfect if
the perfect lighting and perfect
background and perfect everything like
it's just it's lost that of course a
middle point I feel like I'm gonna puke
it's lost that that broadcast yourself
feel you know which was all YouTube was
was broadcast herself and now it's like
hire a crew in an editor and broadcast
instead of broadcasting yourself
you know like no one can really be
themselves I feel like anymore because
you have to be what people want you to
be in order to have some kind of modicum
of success on YouTube and it's just like
you know it's these these channels have
really opened my eyes to a lot because I
you know you know that there's good
channels out there that are you know
have lower subscriber counts but you
don't really realize until you start
digging so definitely keep an eye out
for that video if it doesn't come out
this week if I'm too sick to film it'll
definitely be the next week because I
already have picked ten channels to
highlight so if you're watching this on
the replay I've already picked my ten
channels that I'm gonna highlight but I
do want to do it again in the future so
for that particular video I'm gonna open
up the comments and just say just post
your channels everybody just post your
channels on that video so we can all
find new channels so yeah I'm really
excited about that video but I've
already picked the ten Channel so I
don't want to like make people think
like I I I'm deaf I'm definitely gonna
be checking out more smaller channels
just I want to focus on the ones that
I've got and I want to make sure because
I haven't checked out a lot of videos
from the channels I'm gonna talk to you
guys about so I want to spend more time
on their channels watching more of their
content to make sure that I'm
recommending somebody that's good for
you because like I've seen like the
backlash of you know when somebody
associates with someone and it turns out
their cruddy person and it's like but I
only met them one time and you know
thinking that we're like best friends or
something you know like I don't know I
want to make sure we've got some really
good people I mean there's no real way
to know after watching couples some of
these videos what kind of person they
are but I want to do more research into
these people make sure I'm giving you
some good channels to watch so but
anyway that was all the stuff I want to
show you that's all the PR stuff that I
got
but yeah I'm like really excited about
some of this stuff I want to bring some
of this stuff back most likely a lot of
this is oh wait no I had one more thing
I wanted to show you but most likely a
lot of stuff hopefully will come back at
least in favorites and fails if not in a
full video review it's just like I was
saying my videos are so labor-intensive
I have to make sure I'm really picking
and choosing what I'm dedicating my time
to for a full video you know what I mean
if I could just throw videos up like I
used to back in you know 20 2006 and you
know I could have put up a lot more
content but Susan says make up struggles
is awesome yeah she was in my video for
for losing it for channels under 20,000
she was in that she was in that
recommendation along with Georgia Harris
who I don't know if she's still here but
George and I have been talking a lot
offline online but off of YouTube and
she's amazing
maybe says everyone tell Jen to go rests
okay I can do it it's it's 14 minutes
I've got this thank you so much Mimi but
I can do it I can do it lemon water in
your bottle I should go put some lemon
water I do have some lemon juice
downstairs okay this is one that I
really want to do a full video on
because I think these are super cool
this is a brand called Lou Bella and
they sent these to me for you they asked
if they could send them to me and I
don't normally review things like this
but these things were so cool so there's
a bunch of brands like this on Amazon
they do sell on Amazon and what it is is
it's like a little makeup kit so they
have three different sizes they sent me
all the sizes but I'm just going to show
you the smallest one just because the
other ones are really big this is the
smallest one so you can adjust these
right here you can take these out and
adjust where you want to put the little
things it's almost like my husband look
like he's like it looks kind like a
camera case and then here is where you
could store like an eyeshadow palette
and the zipper but I want to like
measure up like what you can fit in each
one before I do a full review and then
here is where you put your brushes so I
really like this I mean this is really
crunchy and cheap feeling but um but
this feels like like legit down here
Shelby says I've fallen in love with
jewelry to Harris I can watch her vids
all the time I know I really like her
too she just seems like an awesome
person you know what do you mean like
when you start talking to people
Michelle says yes real lemon Jen I don't
think I have a real lemon I think I just
have to fake lemon not fake lemon juice
but lemon juice Oh crystal is here it's
crystal that's another one oh I love her
channel what she's so good sometimes I
feel like crystal doesn't like me very
much even though I know she
guys she's just to the point man she
doesn't mess around
it's Krystal with an exclamation point
she's so soft and sweet and like
beautiful and her makeup looks are sick
they're so good they're like nice
beautiful looks they're not like
instagrammy sharp like you know bold
craziness they're like these beautiful
soft gorgeous looks it's crystal c ry s
tal there's no age crystal but she has
got some sass in her oh my gosh like I
wouldn't want to mess with her I would
be scared if she yelled at me I love
Krystal though when Krystal isn't happy
with me I get really really sad good I
just respect her so much so much respect
to her okay so anyway there we go right
here so these these pull out and then
you can put your brushes in and so far I
mean I just got it so far it seems
really nice I mean this is like hardcore
this is by a brand called Lou Bella
Liu Bei lelei and none of these are
sponsored by the way these are just you
know if I feel like there's something
like these I saw these and I was like I
think people would have really liked
these I'm just gonna hold it up the
other sizes this is the small and then
this is the like I said I want to do a
full video this is the medium so you can
see like kind of how big that is
hopefully it's all in frame and then
this one is the large and I was thinking
like when I had a really lived in a
really tiny off this is the large
they've got handles at the top like that
this one's got a pocket in the back
which is kind of cool like for like if
you are makeup artist and you were you
know we're putting like directions to
where you were going or something like
that like right here would be super cool
yeah that's the large but I was gonna
fill this up with makeup anyway I was
thinking like when I was living it'll
really like the house that I we had
bought before we moved here we had a
really really small bathroom and I had a
lot of trouble doing my makeup in the
bathroom because my bathroom is just so
small but if I could have taken my
makeup put it in something like this
that would like like almost how people
do like everyday makeup drawers I think
cauliflower does them but everyday
makeup drawers like I could put like
mine
make up in this and carry it into the
bathroom so that I wouldn't have to like
you know cuz I usually just put it in I
used to put it in like in like a bag and
I felt like you know I couldn't find
what I wanted but I feel like something
like this I could find what I wanted a
lot easier so so that was kind of why
those caught my eye and almost like yeah
like I don't usually talk about stuff
like that but Michelle says is it it's
to slip into us onto a suitcase handle
yes you know what I think you're right
it is to slip onto a suitcase handle oh
you're right it's not a pocket in the
back you're right it goes all the way
through thank you so much for saying
that yes Jenny Liu Bei Oh a it's not a
pocket it's a it's a suitcase thing yeah
Lana says the same thing thank you for
saying that because I don't want to put
out information that's not right but
that would've been cool if it was like
ugh if it was like a pocket on the back
but it's not I don't know I personally
wouldn't put these outside of a suitcase
that wouldn't scare me I mean I guess it
would probably be fine but like my
makeup my makeup I'd be scared that it
would get all beat up Oh Julie says
Jessica Braun does the everyday makeup
drawer that is very true crystal says I
need a sarcasm button so people can see
I'm saying things tongue-in-cheek I know
crystal I know and you've told me this
but I still like you know like crystal
doesn't like me it's just because I have
so much respect for you and I think
that's why I take it personal but you
know I adore you okay Jennifer says that
case would be awesome for me I'm going
to look it up cool man and like like I
said I do want to do like a full like
what can you fit into these things video
Tish says I never knew what that thing
what that thing was for I always wonder
why they made pockets without a bottom
derp yeah this was like this one doesn't
have it I think it's only on the big one
no it's on the it's on the medium as
well but it's not on the small Joann
says it looks like that could be a great
carry-on case for makeup when you have
to fly yes the only thing is is with
carry-on though you can't you can't
bring liquids so you'd have to just be
really careful and make sure you only
put your power
in their MSA case Spain says I have an
everyday makeup mess does that count yes
it does yes it does Nicole says I try to
carry my pallets on my Rolly bag he
asked me to whenever I have any powder
products I do try to carry those on
that's a really good point
you know crystal says well bond in
person one of these days that will be
amazing to like sit down with crystal
and like have a cup of coffee or a cup
of tea or something with crystal like
that would be amazing I would love that
Vanessa wants to know if it comes in
other colors I don't think so
I think it just comes in the brown and
it's like we call it like a vegan lather
but it really doesn't really look much
like leather in person it looks more
like a mix between like leather and
canvas it's like a shiny canvas I
wouldn't say this looks like a vegan
leather like the way that I've seen
vegan leather before where it honestly
to me doesn't look very leather like
it's more it's more I canvas II like
shiny canvas Jenny says what's the name
of the makeup case loo Bella
Liu Bei lla that's got the little logo
there so what else is going on
oh the medium is 39 77 yeah I'll have to
come back and try to put some of this
stuff in the video description
I always forget especially like today
like I don't know I think I just want to
like go into a whole I just want to like
curl up I brought my blanket in here
just in case in case I started getting
cold actually I think I'm gonna put it
on even though I'm under these lights
usually I'm like sweating on to these
lights but I'm more like this is my
Iceland blanket it's got pictures from
our trip to Iceland but I never finished
the vlogs I don't know if you can see
it's got our pictures I'm just gonna put
it on my lap it's so soft my husband
bought it for me
decorated shed say canvas might want
might a hold up better than the cheap
vinyl imitation leather yeah that's true
that's a good point and it won't scratch
as easily either like I feel like the
the real vegan leather stuff will
scratch really easily and leave marks
where this doesn't it's there so that's
not going to happen it
look like something that can be
scratched and damaged very easily so
Linda says the price is not that bad
yeah I didn't think so either I thought
they looked pretty affordable affordable
I hate that word why did I just use that
word
they look pretty they looked less
expensive see I even catch myself
sometimes they look less expensive than
other similar products yes there we go
and you put the prices up smallish 2977
medium is thirty nine seventy seven in
the largest forty nine seventy seven
which i think is very reasonable for
what you get Michelle says vegan leather
it's pleather right it is kind of Julie
says she just stressed subscribe to its
crystal you should cuz honestly I adore
I really love her videos she's no
nonsense man she just tells it like it
is and I love that I love it Tiffany
says makeup should be on Carrie
um wait makeup should only be Carrie I'm
not sure what you're trying to say
Tiffany I'm sorry
thorry says I hope you don't have a
fever I don't know I can never tell him
myself with my kids I just have to kiss
their heads and I know that they they
why am i drinking coffee I need drink
water I just kissed their heads and I
know that they have a fever like I can
tell again like I can tell their tempter
like my friend my best friend Mary Lynn
she does that with her pool like she
just she sticks her hand in her pool and
she knows what temperature it is and I'm
with my kids like I can kiss their heads
and I know what their temperature is
cauliflower just subscribed to Nicole
and Krystal yeah
really good stuff really good stuff
there's so many good people on YouTube
that just get buried in the madness I
mean there's really like when I first
started on YouTube in 2012 well first
its first started this channel in 2012
like it was hard to get subscribers I
think now it's even harder even if you
have a legit good channel it's really
hard to get people to even see your
stuff you know even if you're even if
your channel you have good watch time
your subscribers love you you get lots
of engagement like you still won't pump
you don't still don't bump up to the top
like it's it's really the stock is is
just against you as far as getting out
there and the thing is is is if I feel
like I find a channel that I think that
you're gonna enjoy and get something
from I want to be able to share that
with you because you know that's what
that's what my channel I want it to be
about is giving you information that
will help make your life better you know
whether it's about products whether it's
other channels to watch things like that

someone to Tabitha was not happy with I
don't know if you weren't happy with
them or not but Julie says I still think
that a monthly who's who for for YouTube
for you would be great series I think so
too I don't want to commit to like a
specific amount of time just because I
don't know I don't like to commit to
things because if something falls
through then I feel really bad like I'm
just not good at that stuff so Nicole
says Eric opinion the vlog is the best I
agree I agree but yeah I hate I hate I
like I took me it forever to commit to a
schedule of Monday Wednesday and Friday
for like other uploads other than what's
it been makeup like it was hard for me
to commit to just doing what's at the
makeup every Sunday for a mile but I
think definitely occasionally I should
do videos like that even if they're not
monthly like just when I feel like I
need to do that so I mean I spent hours
watching these channels and just really
enjoyed it all right Samantha March yes
oh I love Samantha she is so beautiful
and so sweet and she's got books she's
an author she writes books
Samantha March I don't know if you knew
that or not but Samantha marks writes
books and supposedly they're amazing if
you search for Samantha March on Amazon
you should be able to find her books
just super cool Oh Joanne wanted me to
spell early she's spelling dr. Dre is
DRA why not dr. Dre like
the singer or dr. Dre the psychologist
guy there's lots of dr. Dre's alright
I'm gonna pop off here I'm gonna go curl
up with my Iceland blanket and I'm gonna
switch from coffee to tea and I hope you
guys are doing well one beauty attic

channels out there man there's so much
to watch on YouTube so much good stuff
