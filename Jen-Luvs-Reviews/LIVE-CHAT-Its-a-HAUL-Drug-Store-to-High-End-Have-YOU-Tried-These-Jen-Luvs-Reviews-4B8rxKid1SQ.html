the woods if it makeup chat four hours
of sleep edition so it was another rough
night last night with was MP meka but we
did it it was up on time so I'm happy it
all is good I've got my coffee real
coffee in the cup and we're gonna chat
today about some makeup I've got a bunch
of stuff that I want to show you I feel
like I'm acting a little off today I'm
just feeling like not my stuff today I'm
going so yeah we got some stuff over
here and I want to show you what that
stuff is you know just I don't know it's
not like me today but I do have a lot of
stuff that I want to show you except
that I've gotten recently some orders
from friends sending them to me things
like that and I want to get your
opinions on this stuff and I want to
know from you all what you are
interested in seeing on the channel
because at this point I kind of have a
little bit of an overload and I wanted I
want to review like most of this stuff
but I don't know who never would be able
to review all of it so that's why I
really want to show it to you and I also
want to get kind of your opinions if
you've tried these products where if
you're interested a member you know just
kind of get to get my feelers out of the
community about these products and also
I want to show it to you cuz they're new
in case you want to buy them I can
swatch things for you and stuff give you
some idea of the quality of it I have a
lot of things that I've been trying so I
can show you and give you some kind of
mini reviews on some of the stuff I've
been trying so hopefully that'll be
helpful to you I don't want this just to
be all about me and gathering
information for me I also want to give
you some info about some of these
products as well so got stuff from elf
from wet-and-wild from Revlon Too Faced
Kat Von D Smashbox a bunch of different
brands over here so let's go ahead and
get started but before we do we're gonna
take a moment to say hello to the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
also known as the people who are here in
live chat if you work you're watching
this on the replay thank you so much for
being here on the replay you can go
ahead and be part of the collective
brain by leaving their thoughts and
comments about the stuff down in the
comment section down below
live chat is at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time
every Sunday
that I can do it and we are not going to
have a chav a chat in next week but the
following week I won't be here I'm gonna
be a generation moody in New York and
then the next week would be the 5:00
p.m. shot that's the plan we try to do a
5:00 p.m. Eastern Time chat the last
Sunday of the month is the effort made
and this will probably be the last five
PM chat for a while because after this
we have Halloween we have Thanksgiving
and we have Christmas and Hanukkah and
all of that all of those the holidays
the winter holidays so it probably won't
be another five Kim schatzel
January's and we make a conscious effort
to get to five Kim chat this coming
month so let's go ahead and take a
second and say hello to the people that
are here alive I feel like it's nice to
when you invite someone in your house to
say if we look to them if you are not
used to live chat or not where I talk to
people I understand some people don't
like the way that I go back and forth
I'm really sorry
this may not be the best video for you
but if you like to learn from other
people other than just one person then
this is a great place for you I promise
you it is worth it my the people in the
collective brain are stinking amazing
they're incredibly intelligent people
they have a lot of knowledge about
makeup and I think that you will benefit
from learning from them so let's start
off with AJ AJ is here a brand new
reporter she's amazing
said good morning from the shores of
Lake Michigan my butch build it built in
time for me to watch what well oh wait
I'm so confused
she built in time for me to watch a live
chat when she planned our surprise
weekend away
oh she's built in time for you you guys
are away oh right there Shay Ann is here
good morning my friend Christina is here
she slept late last night but made sure
she had her alarm on for live chat oh
I'm happy you're here Alysia is here
home lowly - good to see you again Mimi
is here christina is here from Alberta
Canada Sarah is here for her first live
chat divinity is here I'm excited for
you to be here as well Banshee muses
here welcome back Sarah hello to you
from where land Oh stay safe if you know
anybody in
in the affected areas or in the affected
areas please stay safe I'm thinking
about you and sending as much positive
energy as I can you like Megan a good
morning to you my friend Megan is a
reporter extraordinaire she's sticking
amazing
she's one of our Facebook admins she
does a lot of work for what's gonna make
up she is incredible my friend Nancy is
here good morning to you my friend
latina and Julio what's up oh my
goodness they save the team on Julio
down in Florida please they say Shan
said is asking about Orlando Mimi said
anyone divisive we're event yesterday I
did I've got stuff to show you and
speaking of that i'ma show you right now
what's up I didn't say hello to you this
morning hello to you thank you for being
here so we're gonna go ahead we're hold
off on this stuff I got a for sale for
just a moment we're gonna start with the
elf the drugstore stuff that I have
first and then we'll work our way up to
the Sephora brand product so first thing
I want to show you are these elf
palettes I haven't tried elf eyeshadow
palette in a really long time and I
wanted to try them this one is the
sculpting silk eyeshadow and very
pleased I have to say I don't think the
quality has improved very much since um
since the last time I bought them I
think it is improved a little bit do a
little bit of small just watching but
like this shade is so weak and it's like
I can see somebody picking up this
eyeshadow palette and then like why is
my makeup not looking very good what's
going on it's not you my friend it's the
pilot I mean it's just like you look in
the pan at this purple and you see this
pink come out of it and it's like what
is going on so I've used this twice now
I think use I don't use it only one time
only like almost alone and mixed in a
little bit but then I use this kind of
like accent colors to see if I could use
it all and it's really not very good
this one is a little bit better but it's
not good either this one is the neutral
nudes and in my opinion if you it
doesn't matter the price point if you
can't get it to work for you and it's
giving you a subpar look it's not even
worth the money but the three dollars or
whatever for if you can't get a decent
look out of it that lasts through the
day there are so many affordable makeup
brands
are amazing that you can get at the
drugstore and at you know at more
expensive stores any brands things like
that so I definitely don't want to
encourage people to invest in products
even if they're inexpensive that don't
work I think that's really important but
this one's a little bit better like this
sheets no come on I thought that one was
better but it's not yeah they're just
really just powdering this mats pretty
good so you can get some good swatches
off of it and I feel like that's pretty
representative of my experience on the
eye there's definitely some really good
elf products these just happen to not be
some of them I'm not knocking out
there's definitely some good health
products out there I just wanna make
sure I'm clear on that let's see what
you guys are saying in the collective
bringing about these products Riley says
I love the matte from that palette yes
that is much better definitely divinity
says there are $10 cults are not bad I
agree I think if you're going to go for
an alpha eyeshadow palette just take
like the Bullock at the ten dollar one
if you can
Tony says for me all I really use from
ELF are their brushes and their eyebrow
pencil yeah their brushes are really go
Tony I've never tried their eyebrow pen
so I'll have to check that out
Carrie says hi Jen finally got to join
you for the first time I was up all
night doing homework since nice treat
for me um all Carrie I was up all night
with new girlfriend I was up all night
with you bitch Jimmy says oh I shadows
have never worked for me yeah I did a
review the last night up I chose was
probably three years ago something like
that it was when I actually had a
background you know like the backgrounds
that the people have now where it's with
a ball background but it wasn't lit and
it had like a print on it
like I was trying I was ahead of my time
though with one of those backgrounds
because I had like a really small house
but anyway it's been that long since
I've tried else on shadows so I wanted
to give another try and unfortunately
people talk to me let's go into the wet
and wild stuff I got some stuff in the
wet and wild mermaid collection you
always I left the lip products over
there we put this one down how much for
later I got some stuff to say about that
product ok got some stuff from the
mermaid collection the highlighter is
very very nice I do have a wet and wild
boar bar which is like the unicorn of
what
while it makeup it's like super hard to
find this reminds me of it I like the
you know the bulbar just a little bit
more I feel like there's a little bit
more consistency to the product with
this one I feel like doesn't go on quite
as like you can kind of it's not it's a
little this one's a little more sheer
that's the word I'm looking for this
one's a little bit more sheer but it's
still very nice and it gives a nice glow
to the skin I have to tell you i
swatched yesterday the new Tarte
highlighter that's coming outside the
rain forest legacy highlighter and the
way it felt really reminded me of this
this wet and wild however it did not it
felt super powdery though like even
powdery other than this and this feel
that gets dot a little bit of a little
bit of substance to it you know like
they've got something holding it
together it's a little creamier whether
the one just seemed like it was super
powdery I was very surprised but yeah
I'm really enjoying this the only thing
is it does have a very strong gold shift
so if you don't like a gold shift on
your cheeks you might want to pass on
this if you have a deeper skin tone so
probably look better on you than it does
on someone with a lighter skin tone
it's really just it's very gold in the
shift so you just have to be prepared
for that you can also use this as an eye
shadow though yeah a dress if it looks
very yellow it is it is it's it's very
yellow but if you have a nice warm skin
tone you can probably get away with it
for me it's good I do like it and I have
worn it and I have enjoyed it but Angela
agrees with Tony about that I've got the
brow pencils 8ly says would rather see a
real bathroom than a backdrop yeah I
don't know I think that everybody is
kind of leaning toward those backdrops
I'm not gonna get one
I like my background I worked hard for
this background trying to get it to look
nice and you know I'm not gonna I feel
like no no I just don't want to go with
the cowl on that one yeah I don't want
to do it just because I know it does
look really good and if I didn't have a
background that I liked I would probably
do it look I was at my old house I'd
probably do it but not like that
Jen says
shear is good when you don't want to
blink length well this thing's gonna
blink blink about or what you think that
whatever whatever you do this is gonna
bling-bling
is a little bit more sheer it is than
the goldwater no but I totally see your
point completely
scrappy casa says I'd use of his eye
shadow which i think is a great idea
Definitely Maybe says she prefers a
homey background as well and Debbie
likes my background well thank you and
Tamsin she likes a mix of both I think
it does look beautiful those backgrounds
with the solid color with the light
behind it looks gorgeous I totally agree
I kind of had that kind of thing going
for what's the make up just a little bit
I have a white wall with a light shining
on white wall which I like more city
says Chen you're so natural I love it
well we're hanging out with friends you
know we're just chilling you guys are in
my house now next thing I wanted to show
you I appreciate it next thing I want to
show you is the wet and wild these are
the eye shadows this is the metallic
liquid a shadow I have not swear IDs yet
and I'm excited too they look amazing I
think these would be definitely for
people that really like a darker look I
mean they didn't have I don't think it
had any layer ones where I wish that
they have had some lighter ones we
swatch both of them they are a little
bit watery or than I expected them to be
they're not like the steel glitters but
they're similar so if you were looking
for something like the cielo glitters in
the darker shade then this may be
something you want to look at the purple
one definitely has a black base to it
though so keep that in mind I'm Stefan
chucking against glasses or like the new
ones I just got oh yeah it would give me
glasses twins but anyway yeah so this
they're they're they look like they're
nice but there's definitely you know
they're gonna create a dark look Sammy
says Jen you're one of the coolest
people ever oh thank you
Tammy says at the moment of 37 years I
have to be careful with highlighters not
trying to emphasize those fine lines I
see my highlight subtle do you thing no
I'm I'm older than you are I like my
bling
but it's whatever makes you comfortable
whatever makes you proper whatever makes
you happy
Amy says you have great skin you could
do a video on your daily skincare
routine I actually did recently I talked
about my when I was using ordinary and
then in about a month I'm gonna show you
all the stuff from best and who knew
that I've been using basically I've just
use mostly best in beauty I have a few
other products for them that I've been
using recently that I want to show you
but thank you and some of its genetics
to what my aunt is like got the most
amazing skin like she's in her sixties
and she looks so she's in her forties
like she's my mom looks really great too
so as far as looking really young my dad
goes to so I think that I mean some of
its genetics I think some of it is taken
from me skin Julia says I should just
keep it natural all right so just got
these these are the Revlon youth effects
filling wear foundation and the youth
effects filling blur concealer I've used
these twice now so far I had this break
up on me once but I think it was because
I was using the best damn Beauty oil and
I don't think it agreed so I think I'm
gonna switch over to the best damn
Beauty moisturizer yeah the first time I
use the oil the second time I did I use
just the primer I didn't even more
strive before i musics I'm trying
different things but it did break up on
me with the oils so if you have oily
skin this might break up on you I don't
know I have to shave 220 natural beige
and then for this one I got light this I
don't have an opinion on yet I don't
feel like I was paying attention enough
so you know Terri Lynn wants to know
what my favorite drugstore mascara is
right now I would say drugstore wise I
would go answer this for me flash
princess my stares amazing Jordana best
lash extreme is amazing I also like the
L'Oreal mascaras the um the voluminous
mascara excuse me new voluminous mascara
and the UH the pink one the lash
paradise are also really good we're
gonna get into mascara and then I almost
can't even hold my tongue because I'm so
mad at this you know what we're done
with with drugstore stuff did anybody
else want to say Oh Megan want to say
something about the foundation and then
I'll tell you about the mascara that I
haven't really mad at right now I hated
that foundation I wore it to a funeral
it came off from my tears I had streets
on my face I look terrible on this
Kristen game I haven't seen her in years
in person and I want to hug her when I
hang out with Christine who Santa swore
oh hello Christina Christina from
Christina and cosmetics hello good to
see you she's watching while she gets
ready for Santa and I got something
cooking as far as uh you know on
Instagram on Instagram you got something
cooking so stay tuned just as the
foundation breaks up on her oily skin oh
good to know
Mary says totally great about having
good jeans on 49 and my daughter just
turned 31 people think we're sisters
my mom doesn't look great either I love
it yeah I mean I think that some people
they tout their skincare routine as
being like the ultimate and everyone
will look like them if they just need
this thing fair routine when I do think
the genetics does play a role in it and
also you know how much sun exposure
you've had in your life and things like
that who that makes a big difference
Oh Julie's gonna be a charity all I'm so
excited I can't wait to meet your Julie
mixture clapping and say hi and getting
hugs on take pictures and stuff um
Stephanie wants to know if I've ever met
Emily Noelle I have never met her
Kristen is good friends with her but I
have never met her I would love to wear
today though because she is literally my
YouTube idol from the beginning of my
channel like I love her I absolutely
adore her Kristen was one of my youtube
idols - she's a benefit it's just a
fantastic review work you're not
subscribed to Chris thinking you should
go do that
geh M is for laughing very thorough very
you know she really tests things and
really gets down in the nitty-gritty
which I love all right let's get into
this not scared I think Peck please
please for the love jumpin Jehoshaphat's
this is the Urban Decay troublemaker
mascara I want to find someone that was
not sent this that loves this I'm gonna
just be just straight out and say that
oh my gosh somebody please tell me that
you love this
this is one of the worst mascaras I've
ever tried
it smells like chemicals and like white
fish it smells terrible and it doesn't
work Ellen Kristen it doesn't work it is
the one is super pokey it reminds me of
that norwich mascara with the NARS
audacious mascara I think is what it was
called but this I'm waiting for somebody
to tell me that they actually like this
instead I knew you were to talk about
this Nikki muscare oh my gosh Nancy
Nancy sent it to me and I always feel
bad when I don't like somebody Nancy
talking who can answer send me but this
is the thing I didn't warn you about it
so I think it's totally worth it smells
terrible when I first opened it it was
like a wall of horrible smell now I
can't smell it unless I let get it close
to my face and then I can smell like
when I put it here I can smell it
Felicia says when is Jen meeting me work
September 23rd I believe somewhere in
that weekend it's the Saturday Sunday
there it smells horrible and the wand
does not work it's very pokey it doesn't
feel like it pokes my eyes but it
remembers me and remembers me it reminds
the art of that NARS mascara it does
absolutely nothing I mean I have very
nothing passionate I have very um you
know like sparse you know you know not a
whole lot of lashes so maybe somebody
thank you first time to clean there
sorry I'm off topic Oh didn't get much
sleep um when it goes through the lashes
it definitely colors them but I feel
like it clumps might very few lashes
together if you want to try okay master
that's good
try the perversion conversion is really
really good I don't know what this is
but it's sting and terrible step this is
the to new troublemaker mascara I can't
even like I'm shocked because I've seen
such positive reviews of this and it
bothers me actually bothers me cuz I'm
like looking at me I guess everyone has
like their own opinions about things and
maybe it just worked completely
differently maybe I've got a bum tube I
mean there's all kinds of things that
you know that could be happening I don't
know but packaging is gorgeous
this one the worst mascaras had ever
tried it's horrible so if anybody I
haven't seen anybody
they've tried it yet but yeah this is
the second when they say it's expert I
didn't you test that part I didn't do
that no I didn't do that but I don't
even know if I want to that's the thing
it's like why would I even wear that
like no one's no one's gonna want to be
like that with me but that one looks
terrible you know I mean like it's just
my husband look at my eyelashes and go
nope alright let's move on let's do what
I did want to show you these are back
adjust our price range real quick these
are deep ofse not the the glitters hold
on a second I'll be right back
good morning and so these right here
these are lip paints and these are from
a brand called tattoo junkie I believe
can't find where it says it here we go
tattoo junkie and what you're supposed
to do is you're supposed to take these
you put them on and then you use these
like metallic or glitter stoppers and
put them over top I can tell you right
now these are very very drying so if
drawing is not your thing you definitely
don't want these but I do like the
effects of these so I think I might keep
like them for these but um Oh No Julie
lovely your your comic got flagged he
says he wants to have sex with this fish
smelling face that's what I'm saying
that's exactly what I'm saying
um but anyway so this this sugar one the
sugar lip effects is very gritty and if
he gets a new teeth lips and I have
tried this one yet this one is the I
don't know they omit the labeling is
really bad I don't know which one goes
with which at this point because I've
been using them but I have what ever
skinny-dipped and makes and they're just
okay so far I'm thinking about doing the
full review of these
but I don't know they yeah Christmas set
the tattoo junkie dried out her look so
bad that's what I'm saying
it's exactly what I'm saying Steph
didn't like the last paradise why not
you didn't like it I find it to be a
little clumpy is that why that might be
why daniel said man even like the
troublemaker either I thought he did
like it taught me anything like it
no no maybe i spaced out in the middle
of you didn't watch the whole thing I
didn't watch part of his review I don't
know if I watched the whole thing
vana says I love him you do these live
chats oh he is here from a dreamcatcher
hello my friends Kristine's my friends
my friend or two people my friend
Christine says I forget was branded as
my favorite mascara right now has the
voluminous butterfly I think that's
L'Oreal that's a really good one too but
yeah those are super drying so just be
aware okay back in a high-end land let's
talk about what I got at the I have to
support that yesterday so I did a whole
live stream yesterday on this I'm not
gonna do too much on this today because
I spoke about it yesterday but this is
the toothpaste planner thingy you take
this off and the planner is like it
feels very targeted you know like when
you get something look at Office Depot
or Target or something like that it's
very much like that looks like this and
then it's got the planner and it says
don't let today be a waste of makeup and
it's got a calendars and places to write
note some things I show it more in the
livestream video and then this is the
palette and what we did in the video is
we talked about the color selection in
here and how it whether or not it was
similar or the same as previous Too
Faced holiday colors so if you're
curious about that definite check out
that livestream I don't want to spend a
whole lot of time we've said so much
left that I want to to talk to you about
but yeah and then also comes with be
better than sex mascara and then this
melted matte this is the melted matte in
the shade I forgot sell out and it
smells like butter which is weird but I
haven't tried it yet on my lips but I'll
let you know if there's anything
interesting I want to tell you bout that
I'm sure I'll come back and tell you at
some point maybe he says the thought of
fish that in it they'll be making me gag
oh my gosh it smells terrible horrible
oh my gosh
and I don't want to say a fancy beauty
review please I have one thing for fenty
beauty for you today and we can show
that next because you mentioned it this
is the only thing I got from Fenty
beauty yesterday because I wasn't sure
he was gonna sell out so I ordered stuff
online I got the foundation and I got
one of the cheap products and then
that's all I got but I didn't want to
show this to you this is the lip gloss
it's a universal gloss let me swatch it
on my hands the wand is very fat and
very soft but I'm gonna swatch it like
right here so you can see the the color
if the color is nothing magical but it's
not a color that I've ever you know that
you've never seen before there is a
little bit no I mean there is a little
bit of shimmer in it it's kind of cool I
don't know if you can see that let me
see if you can see I don't think you can
see it there's a tiny bit of shimmer in
there very very tiny but it's not
glitter like it's not like one of those
like look at chunk of glitter it's gonna
stay I knew that so let's go ahead and
come down look what let me show you what
it looks like I put it on last night it
smells amazing it smells like a cherries
to me like cherry scented candy
it is not sticky at all and but it's
it's a very nude gloss I mean it's going
to be universal because it's going to
show the color of your lips through it
you know that's that's why it's
universal and I think that if she's only
gonna come out with lip rod one lip
product I think that was smart of her to
do something that's very sheer because
that way you know it is gonna be
universal for everybody
it feels very kind of heavy on the lips
a little bit heavy but it doesn't feel
sticky at all and it doesn't feel overly
oily either
it feels very smooth this is um this is
Rihanna's brand yes I don't know she
owns the brand know if she's just like
you know the person I know I think she
might just be like partnering with it is
when I heard I was um Jackie I was
talking something like that on her
Twitter I didn't quite get this
happening but yeah so so this is just I
mean it right now from first impressions
from putting on last night I'm putting
it on today it doesn't seem to be
anything amazing I mean the packaging is
gorgeous the wand is wonderful the smell
is amazing it is strong though so if
you're sensitive to scents you don't
want to get this but I mean it's pretty
if you're a big gloss person with my
friend Laura for mrs. little Lynn she
loves glosses the she loves this but
it's Emily not like a super unique kind
of thing at least so far from my first
impression of it I'm just having worn it
just now and then last night but it is
pretty V said something what have you
say she said the trophy white huh
took trophy white huh the trophy white
highlight honestly confuses me a bit
like super bold I haven't seen anyone
that I agree it looks good on but I a
super good highlight is not my thing
I feel like trophy wife looks best on
tan - deep skin tones I think it looks
odd on like skin tones I personally
don't like the way that it looks I saw
it on a couple of people that have light
skin tones and I did not enjoy the way
that it looked there's there was one
verse that limits to the fancy beauty on
because there was one I swear it look
like Cheetos even like at least for like
from my perspective thinking about what
I like and makeup they look like
straight-up Cheetos to me
I don't even know about that mmm let me
get into the support a crow put so I can
tell you what it is but yeah so my fancy
beauty review there it will be one but
it's gonna be a while it's gonna be a
long Wow because I have a bunch of stuff
that I'm still I want to review first
and also I am gone yet so it's gonna be
at least two weeks at least let me look
fancy but it's seriously it look like
Cheetos I don't know if it was the
trophy wife or not is this
that's the blotting papers hold on do
you guys know what I'm talking about
mango chilli maybe maybe that was it oh
that no trophy wife maybe it was trophy
wife I don't know but somebody swatch it
and I was like terrible it was like
orange you notice that some people look
like they're orange with this foundation
I've heard oxidize is really bad I don't
know if I got the right shade or not but
I might have to just go back to Sephora
and have them shave match me and return
it because chilli mangoes it must be the
chili mango thing is everybody say chili
mango yeah it's just yeah yeah it's it's
a beauty CJ it is is it expensive it's
like uh no I think it's reasonable for
Sephora price brands it's not like Marc
Jacobs level you know it's it's in there
price-wise I haven't check price per
gram I'll have to let you know about
that yeah that's my initial thoughts on
fenty i I really am disappointed at some
of the reviews that have come out
already you know I I'm disappointed in
that you know giving such strong
recommendations for things that they've
just tried it bothers me to be honest
and you know I I don't I wish people
would try products that thing people
just want the instant gratification of
knowing whether product is good or not
but you can't do that that's it's not
possible you know you want to push the
video out yeah everybody wants to know
yeah get your opinion out but at least
say that it's a first impression you
know at least call it what it is and it
just
no it just bothers me because I feel
like people are gonna go out based on a
first impression and they're gonna spend
their hard-earned money on something and
it's based on a very shallow review I
don't know that's just my personal
preferences Megan says Jen check the
group I made a post last night about a
rep from Fendi talking about how it
doesn't oxidize she says foundations a
toxic oxidized turn brown or green I've
never heard of a foundation turning blue
before that is weird Megan okay we'll
walk to check that out yeah she died
versus a chili mango is a blush it's
probably the one that I saw squash all
right let's go on to the next thing
another disappointment so far much
disappointment but it's it's slightly
disappointment but I want candy banana
pudding young the thing that's
disappointing me is the scent I love
banana scent and this does not smell
like bananas at all it smells like sweet
makeup it doesn't it doesn't even smell
anything like bananas like I don't know
anybody could say that this smell like
bananas it's not it's not close mm-hmm I
only use it once and I don't think I'll
use it correctly so I don't have like a
a review on that yet I'm working on it
but I'm really disappointed it doesn't
smell like bananas and then I have this
this is the I want candy pilot I was
thinking about not opening these and
just returning them so they can be
resold but then some people in the
community were saying how good this
pilot was keep it I'll try and honestly
I'm going it twice on my eyes I've
really liked the looks for Too Faced
looks like these do not compare to like
my dubious place and my colored ring and
Natasha been known on all those like the
ones that I really really like in the
busy arts but they're not they don't
compare to that but I am getting some
nice looks out of it and I really like
the toppers are the knot toppers the
underneath the base coats the base
things melissa says I met candy
yesterday also oh it's so awesome it
does not smell like Nilla wafers don't
snowing anything except for makeup miss
Morgan no no it's not my way there's no
away for small news now that was fun
good but yeah I'm very exciting process
me is these three shades here because I
feel like candy took to face out of the
box
face is stuck in this box you know for
most of their palettes especially like
their holiday palettes like they're
stuck in this rut you know they get
something and then they play it to death
I mean the peaches are played to death I
hope they move on from the peaches and
go on to the strawberries at this point
I think the pictures have been
overplayed at this point but she took
them out of their box with these three
shades here and we really like this we
appreciate a lot it's awesome I didn't
look like this this one right here and I
did a look with this one right here I
haven't done anything with this one yet
so where he was coming on this I
definitely want to review it you know
I'm hoping people will still be able to
get to get it by the time I can review
it let me see what the communities
saying um yeah I'm not gonna I don't
want to talk smack about other youtubers
specifically but I'm reading your
comments and I get young Holly says not
real into the fruit scented makeup
unless it's a lip smacker that cost
there you go Shelby says transformers
yeah she and II did call them
transformers I don't know if I would
call them transformers cuz I think I'm a
transformer I think of something that's
gonna like a holographic my holographic
but it like an iridescent lipgloss or
like two base unicorn tears like that I
think of as a transformer well I feel
like I feel like these are we weren't
like a base that gives a little more
umph a little more pizazz to the shadows
I'm not that completely transforms them
maybe the whipped cream does the other
two I don't know so much
aybe above I hoped you faced abandoned
fruit in general and just makes good
quality makeup I think that it should be
both I think it should be both alright
so the next thing I got at the sale was
the treasure box collector set for me
tart and I did show this on snapchat if
you're not following that snapchat
I think it's Jen love je and Lu Zhi if
not try gem those reviews on snapchat I
mean snap snapping a lot I'm mostly on
Twitter and snapchat lately Twitter is
Jen loves reviews on there all the time
so anyway so this is the new Tarte
palette for the holidays and I really
like this concept I think this is a
great idea for a gift for someone that
doesn't own a lot of makeup because you
literally get everything in there not
everything can say you literally get
everything but you get everything you
need as far as outer products for the
face
and then you get this little thing here
it says hidden treasures and inside you
have mascara you have a nude lip paint
and then you have a pencil eyeliner this
is the sex kitten eyeliner that I've
never tried and then you get a ton of
eyeshadows the eyeshadows in here go
from a light day look to like a more
smoky look down here I haven't even
touched these yet ooh formula seems like
they use the good formula formula for
this that one feels pretty little pretty
little pretty there yeah use the good
formula not the holiday crap formula
yeah yeah
price for the torte I think was $59 $59
so you get are missing one two three
four five six so forth 624 I shadow to
get this giant highlighter two blushes
to bronzers and then the mascara the lip
and the eyeliner I mean just whew I'm
glad they use the good formula it looks
like I'm excited sometimes they just put
the junk formula on these things you
know
Shawna it's 50 I think it's $59 but yeah
I mean nice let's do this highlighter
look like it's it's going for this baby
this could be like a deal-breaker but
people that don't want to super bright
highlighter this is not a super popping
highlighter it looks like it'll be a pop
but not crazy pop yeah that's nice very
cool and it looks like they've
definitely take into consideration
deeper skin tones and over here this one
has some shimmer in it though this one's
matte these two are matte you see they
have names on them anywhere on anywhere
our names on that anywhere I don't think
there's names on anywhere no I think
they just put some colors in here it
just says hi eyeliner blush bronzer
highlighter lipstick oh no they're our
names so
the see if I can find we have names on
other names on the eighth note house
let's to know what the oh no there are
names there's names for the eyeshadows
utopia cloud9 Bazaar all trinket tales
world scenic what's the names on the
blushes tickets like anything
Israel eyes shadowy variants one on the
second okay perk Amazonian clay Brett
blush and perk which is another blush
navigate is a bronzer and excursion is
the other bronzer and then the
wanderlust Amazonian clay highlighter so
that is the one that I think no I was
gonna say I thought that was the one
that was in the store but that one's not
it's the that's a rainforest of the sea
one and then sex kitten eyeliner and
then the lights camera lashes board one
mascara and the grant artist clicked on
that lip thing okay so now we know in
case you guys know those shade needs I
don't know those but yeah I mean it
looks amazing I definitely need to prove
it I just watched it for the first time
just now so I can't give you anything
but Alyssa says that's one bulb into
palette yes but if this is your entire
makeup collection like this is something
I would get for my mom because this is
something she can just put in a drawer
and this is this is like all she would
oh okay I gotta give her stuff but you
should those three shouldn't like to
have a ton of stuff you know but if this
is like adding to your collection and
just be nice every once a while I can
angry meaning Shawna let's see I shadow
blush highlighter bronzer and lipstick
made in the USA eyeliner made in China
mascara manufactured in Italy assembled
in Taiwan distributed from New York so
they are either so the eyeliner wasn't
even in China
Mercedes says my birthday is in November
and I will be right with Jen yeah that's
awesome because I smell it Cindy wants
to know okay I'll take that got me smell
it well spend some time with this one
this is one that um it should be coming
out hopefully support soon
it has a little bit of that vanilla
scent but is not overpowering it's not
overpowering let me see if it says that
it's got yeah vanilla it's got the
vanilla in it but it doesn't smell super
strong like when I opened up the tarts
Pro palette for the first time we let
that walk of scent I didn't smell that
from this it wasn't super strong but it
might very you know they they may be
stronger in some and others but I
definitely smell it too much but it
definitely has the scent definitely has
the second proceeding says birthday gift
choices at Sephora moisturizer or twit
pain and blush so obviously I went with
Tarte nice nice I won't talk to I did
Tony says that's why the shadows are the
right formula because they're they hurt
people's complaints about the
irregularities and made them here yeah I
mean I think that's really smart
oh yes Enya says generation Beauty use
code GB spanky $90 $99 tickets $69 off
yes and I think that all of the
influencers have they're all the FCE
creators all have their so I think
there's a GP here we all and a GB Cindy
I think they all have their own so from
one for $99 we shouldn't put that in the
show I forgot about that
thank you you setting it for that yeah
intro to make up rose absolutely okay so
let's talk about some of this other
stuff cuz we've got 20 minutes left this
I also picked up just as an impulse buy
this is the Kat Von D everlasting
glimmer Dale liquid lipstick they were
all really bold shades that were
completely out of my comfort zone except
for this one this one is in the shade
thunderstruck and it's the mute you know
swatch it here for you and then we'll
put it on the lips so I haven't even put
it on my lips yet will put on the lips
and I'll wipe it off because I know it's
gonna freak me out a little bit it's
very orange in my lights it looked more
champagne in the store but it looks more
peachy orange here here okay let's try
it on and we have a mirror all right
it's right I guess I should wipe off
Rihanna
by Rihanna let's like wall before you
put on the cap on alright I'm still
wearing my pajamas
I didn't I didn't have time when I slept
in as late as I possibly could today all
right
it's a pink and white suit this off my
hand oh my goodness these wet-and-wild
are not coming off all right let's dip
in real good dipping it real good Oh
so what insane
it's definitely sheared well they say
you can use it as a topper and that's
what I was playing on use it before
anyway it's kind of weird weird press it
says you Jen you never trust its store
lighting you are so right that was
really weird on me right now but it's
cool there's no like real I was hoping
those gonna be like a little bit of a
ship to it elissa mixing the song see it
was fun which make sure you wait until
the end of what's that makeup today
there's a little law surprise there it's
drying gallon I want to see how it feels
as it dries down it's getting a little
more stiff as it drives down mer city
says the Hurricanes got me freaking out
Stacy please
I was in a 100 mile an hour hurricane in
in Orlando we're not were there but like
just outside I waited near one year and
it was scary and it's done it was only
100 compared to some of the winds that
people are getting Maddie says I don't
care for that lip but you do you Jen and
the thing is is right now it doesn't
look good because of what I'm wearing
but I think that with the right outfit
or if I use it as a topper it could
definitely work there is a little bit of
a stick to it
it's coming off on my lips I'm saying we
put on the stand it's not coming off so
that's good that's not coming off but
it's definitely weird you know what it
reminds me how his 1970s like it reminds
me of like Goldie Hawn on that show when
they did the 70s and she's dancing and
she's where
can't be closed and she laughed really
obnoxiously what was that show called
that's what it reminds me of something
she would have worn like that nude 1970s
nude color
who's that thing I can't remember
it's know what's going I know somebody's
gonna know I'm gonna try to take this
off but it does feel a little bit heavy
but not so it was TV show it feels a
little bit heavy but it's not terrible
laughing Thank You April I never
actually watched laughing but I watched
reruns of laughing nice if I can get it
off this is gonna be a challenge oh my
gosh it glitter all over my chin now
this is not a good idea
oh I've got some Bioderma drying down
bashang shiny yes
well because that literate that's a view
shared they're not that 70s show like a
real 70s show if Goldie Hawn Polly palm
was like in her 20s oh my god the must
don't was beat with this don't go a
popping in and out of doors alley
exactly Austin Powers that's a classic
whoa all right Lisa I got more than
socks I look ridiculous I do have a few
more things that show you you got 15
minutes can I have a few more things
yeah I have a lot to show you actually
still oh my gosh I have like glitter
mustache I might have to like actually
wash my face at some point let's try one
more dip because I don't wanna spend
forever washing like like waiting on my
face I don't want to show you you can't
do that on television oh my gosh that
show was my addiction my grandma had
cable we didn't have cable
we have money for cable but my grandma
did so whenever whenever my grandma's
house I got to watch you cancer down
television I would always go straight to
the television set see when it came on
and for a while there was no like TV
Guide look if you want to buy a TV Guide
in order to know what
what time so I'm just randomly every
half an hour go to the totally set and
check and see if you can't do that
intelligence is on I had a crush on sari
with an a asked asked her or something
like I can't remember what his name was
but I had a huge crush on one of the
characters on that show you know it's
like oh my god I said then the Tina says
Julio had to leave he works at the
church and there is this homeless man
that needs shelter and he's going to
look for me oh my god Julio stayed safe
oh my gosh don't tell me this okay let
me show you a couple more things I know
I might still have some glitter going on
on my face but it's like I don't want to
spend forever like and off you guys are
just gonna have to bear with me on that
one so another thing Nancy was kind
enough to send me a couple of things
from ooshpa me which was so nice of her
well there's the eyeliner thing so I
haven't tried this one yet but I tried
the eyeliner and now I don't see the
eyeliner wheel that I really like the
eyeliner wheel the eyeliner it was cool
it's not pokey like I saw them people do
reviews of the Mack one and it looked
like it was pokey and this was not poke
it's very smooth somewhere I just think
that oh there it is it was underneath my
mirror so let me show you the wheel it's
not like product on it because I was
using it but it's very smooth I know the
Sabrina did a review of these but I
didn't um I didn't watch her review yet
I need to get another another gel liner
because I went to use my genius placed
liners and they had dried out one of
them wasn't closed all the way but the
other one was and it was dry so
disappointed so Julio is a good man but
yeah so this seems really really cool
it's definitely not for doing wings
though I don't think I think that would
be really hard to do a wing but it's
it's not pointy enough for the flip you
know it's it's one length and that's
what makes it hard to do the way you can
do like a little wing and then finish it
up with um with a pen but this is going
to be more or with this you can finish
it up with uh with this brush here but
um yeah but I really like this so far
I'm really enjoying it and then this is
the ice Stamper I have tried to shut it
Sabrina did a full of you and I plan on
doing or you to if I can get to it you
open it up and show you so the idea with
this is we're supposed to be able to
make that triangle on the outside of
your eye like super easy I want to show
you like the dimension of it
Emily says her two-year-old lost my
glasses thank you
what's so nice so so you're supposed to
kind of do this with it it's very hard
it's very stiff and then you've got this
one here which you can find under like
this the Sandia wants me to review the
NYX elements palettes I want them all to
I want them all to I'm hoping mix will
send them to me I'll be using I don't
know if they would go but yeah so this
is this big if you got a little tiny
eyes this might not work this big but I
would like to review them I had my eyes
on the Alyssa actually what I'm just
gonna say adore her how you love her ten
point it says Sabrina's another
underrated channel totally agree lovely
Sabrina so yeah so that's the woosh
Beauty stuff I don't have anybody else's
tried it but I would love to know I've
heard they're expensive yeah they're
like 20 or $30 apiece these oh you might
talk about the NYX palettes the other
$30 each
I know I know but that's why I think
it's important to have some really good
solid reviews on down so you know
whether it's worth it or not yeah look
Tamm says jenna ever want to get rid of
that sweater I love you can and I'll pay
the shipping oh this is my jealous son
sweater I got this when I was in
Yellowstone two years ago but if I ever
decide Tam's one straight to go straight
to you so anyway yeah these are and
these are pricey too which I was
surprised because they don't seem to be
of like super high quality you know what
I mean like they're not like fancy or
anything like they're they seem like
they probably you know only cost me of
two dollars to make but they're quite
expensive I get the innovation is what
you're paying for
one thing I wanted to show you that I've
been trying to death if it's that me
that I really like a lot that I was very
surprised by Monique wants me to
acknowledge all September birthdays if
you have a birthday in September I wish
you a happy happiness birthday you've
had a birthday in August or in July or
June or any month before that happy
birthday to you too because it totally
missed it and they're amazing and you
deserve a happy birthday and I hope you
had a good one
so if you have a birthday in September
how does that how do they do that are
you good
Oh Christina's leaving bye Christine I
am NOT I have to go I have to make
breakfast for my kiddo to get to the gym
Oh girlfriend rock it out at the gym
rock it out of the gym get a girl all
right so anyway benefit had sent this to
me and I hadn't tried it at first
actually really like this this is the
highbrow is a highlighting crayon
there's something about the texture of
this and the way that it blends out that
it's just beautiful it's really nice
it's nice if I can gather when I arms
face on this side I don't know if you
can see it but it's very opaque and even
though it looks like it's like similar
in my skin tone I thinks it just working
for many skin tones I don't think that's
totally gonna do it justice it looks
much better on the eyes but it's just a
way to to really highlight the brow bone
enjoin this I'm surprised at how much I
enjoy it because I tried products like
this before and just kind of a month but
this one I owe people one is this fake
sincerity frightly well I am sincere
though I know it sounded a little you
know I know it sounded like that I
didn't mean like that I do wish
everybody a very happy birthday
I remember anything a lot of sleep
either I hope nobody took that as me
being like yeah right don't have a hug
you know I mean like I'm just being I'm
just trying to be silly
maybe I failed but just so you know I do
really truly wish you a happy birthday
is it um next thing Nancy was kind
enough to send me as well these are the
Smashbox ombre lipsticks so the idea
behind these is they've got three colors
and you are supposed to kind of draw
them on and it's supposed to give you an
automatic ombre lip the big problem with
these that I've noticed
is when you apply like this side makes
sense but this side you have to kind of
go like this and go like backwards so I
almost wish that they had made them flat
so that they wouldn't be all mom you
know what I mean I'm liking the purple
one better than the nude because you can
see the ombre better but it's really
pretty let me do a little swatch on the
side of my hand so you can see the
colors white and that's the way it ends
up on your lips but as soon as you kind
of move your your lips together they do
blend but I think it looks nice I really
like the way this one look this one is a
little bit mushy err as far as this is
the new one it's a little mushy err as
far as the nice if I can find a better
place to swatch the colors aren't is
different so this one I feel it blends a
little bit better together
dreama says yeah I'm not feeling those
lipsticks what are they thinking
sometimes I wonder yeah I think it's one
of those things that they're trying to
do something different and unique but I
feel like doing an actual ombre lip is
not that word like I have a tutorial of
how I do my ombre lips if you're curious
how I want to do them but you know you
want to do something different you want
people are always trying something
different and no one else is done and I
think that they did a nice job of trying
but I don't know I don't know if it's
worth the price for them they're very
hydrating they feel really good on the
lips they're very nice lipstick I didn't
I didn't wear the purple one for very
long so I can't tell you as far as
laughing how long the purple one but the
nude one the last powerless decent it
faded very nicely but you know typical
lipstick where nothing amazing shabby
box says that when I hasn't wanted some
of those two lipstick lip definite put
out that right
that's one of those brands I never know
how to put out then they have some too
nice very cool good to know April says
looks like the 90s but the dark lip
liner nude lips well it's and ends up
blending together pretty well so it ends
up not looking so ends up not looking so
like you know with the dark and the
light you know I mean what does cat you
are they are so
they can awkward to apply pretty but you
need to clean up around the lip yes
totally agree and that was hard too
because they be played is smeared so you
have to be really careful how you clean
up then says YouTube unsubscribe - oh no
no I had a lot of people tell me you've
been unsubscribing people refresh my
subscriptions didn't see you so I
subscribed again I am so glad you're
back
thank you so much for coming back
appreciate it what else okay this is the
last thing that man seen except that I
have not tried yet this just came in the
mail this is the glossy a router and I
would love to know more opinions on this
I have tried it Nancy loves it
and I haven't tried it and I'm so
excited to try this this whoa I know
nothing about this because I don't I
don't watch those fancy-schmancy these
two reviews we're a little bit of a like
a powdery sex like I know it's hard to
it doesn't smell especially makeup II
that's not the right thing but like a
fresh light powder not a baby powder but
it's close in that family but lighter
than that not as strong of a specific
baby powder scent but similar to that in
the same family as baby powder so look
it's got this cushion in here yeah I've
never seen this product I've never seen
it and I know that's terrible that I've
never seen it but I've never seen it
before but Nancy swears by it so weird
it's got like a trampoline in the middle
of it Jamie said they almost ordered it
yesterday nice what are the ingredients
in the router let's look let me put this
on my hand work like that I just want to
give away appeals Hills they're soft and
I think it's a translucent so if you're
deeper I think this one will probably
work as far as from my first impression
okay let's see ingredients mica silica
boron nitride Kaelyn
so nothing not crazy the silica is gonna
give it that slip mica is the pigment
boron nitride I forget what that does
Halen
there's diamond powder in this holy moly
hmm oh I wonder what that's out there's
no shine in it so it's not like a shine
like a 19-5 thing he says Jenny watch
Lee Anne says she recently bought it
reviewed it wasn't sent for PR I will
have to I used to be subscribed to Lee
Anne and then he got unsubscribed I
don't know why she seems very nice
I just wasn't finding myself watching
your videos Emily says I really really
want to try that water I'm so happy
you're trying it Jen oh good I'm so glad
see this is why I wanted to show you
because I'm not anything about this
sounds like what you're saccharin no
that's just two-faced bad but yeah I
mean it's good to know because I don't
know anything about this I don't watch
reviews on it like oh no Nancy says
that's the suspensive with Diamonds I
know but it's got diamond powder in it
that's crazy
dimethicone yeah and a couple of
pigments but there really aren't a lot
of ingredients in this and there are a
couple ingredients that I'm not like off
the top of my head familiar with like
I've seen him before but off the top of
my head I don't know what they are but
it is a mica based product mica and
silica so okay good to know that
everybody's interested in this so I
won't have to try that thank you for
that I appreciate it with that I think
that was everything I wanted to show you
we made it through everything and I've
got three minutes left
yeah everybody really wants to hear
about the welder okay cool awesome
thanks Nance it's a review it I really I
mean I didn't even realize it was like a
theme maybe you press it enough you'll
get a diamond maybe just keep bouncing
my finger on the trampoline play me play
me I don't want to waste too much
product cuz that's plenty Jackie I know
gave it a great review awesome Jackie I
know I know everyone has their favorite
youtubers and stuff like I don't know
how much it is because Nancy bought it I
have no idea no I think it's responsive
though because it could also yeah let's
hook it up Wow $22 that's it well that
was more than that
$22 of that right it's only $22 I
thought it was like a $50 product or
something that's cool that's great
look it's not like obnoxiously expensive
that's cool there are three colors yes
the welder has a light a medium and a
deep and I don't think that um it lets
me flip over anymore to show you but
there's a light a medium and a deep okay
cool
nice and there is a brush um you know
what I left the brush downstairs it does
come with a brush and it said it's not a
powder it's router for non Dewey days
water will cut shine blur the appearance
of course set makeup look like skin
router won't leave a chalky film cake
into fine lines flatten skin texture or
announce its presence in photographs no
camera flash back in three sheer glowy
adaptable shades because no skin tone is
HD white pear wood angelically soft
router brush for an all-over targeted
application so I did she did get the the
router brush for me so you say seven
dollars if you get it with the router
brush and the router brush is got a
little spinning planet oh the brushes
looks like it's $35 whoa okay so the
brush is 35 and it's 22 plus 35 so
that's 52 minus the seven is 45 so 45
for the powder and the brush which I
mean it's expensive but it's not like it
doesn't seem like it's seriously super
overpriced mine is the white one I'm
assuming I would imagine because it's
pretty light
it doesn't say Oh light medium is what
it says light medium so what else what
else we want to talk about before we go
I got just like one minute one to two
minutes left Harry Bailey says thank you
for always being so thorough honest and
down-to-earth and relatable and we're
taking your time to do all this food
reviewers you'll always be my top three
favorite and trusts of youtubers I'm
gonna let you in on a little secret
yes I do things for you guys but I also
do it because I love it you know like
it's it's a yeah I want to put effort in
you know
to give you guys a great review and I
want to put effort into you know make
sure that you guys are taking care of
but I also do it because I love
researching ingredients I love dougie
digging deepen and being thorough
like it makes me happy to do it so part
of it is selfish that I love it
the other piece that she just said was
about being like down-to-earth in the
neighborhood I think some people really
do take themselves way too seriously
like overall I've met like my first
celebrities that I that I met were like
when I was like 20 years old and I was
always a person I never asked for
autographs
I never took pictures with them you know
or at least well that's not never
yes ain't never but it wasn't like a big
for me once it pictures with celebrities
because I really feel like you know
we're all just people and that's not
gonna change like I'm never gonna change
in that way because I it's so deeply
ingrained in me do not think that some
people are better than others and it
annoys me to no end when people have
that superiority complex because they're
really beautiful or they have a big
following or you have a high paying job
or you know whatever it is
it drives me bonkers and it is like in
my soul how much I hate that so you can
count on the fact that I am never going
to be like a step up like ever it
doesn't matter what size channel I have
it doesn't matter anything like I want
I'm always gonna be me because I don't
take it that seriously I don't feel like
what happens to me on social media is me
you know what I mean like that the
outside things like how many followers
you have does not impact who you are as
a person it doesn't make you a better
person it just means that a lot of
people happen to enjoy what you're doing
which is great but that doesn't make you
better
you know like I'm that's so engrained in
the night mmm-hmm drives me bonkers so
anyway so that was what I wanted to say
about that Nega premise says hello my
friend you are very down to earth and I
always appreciate that in you that's why
I'll always support you thank you so
much
and you ever feel like for some reason
done lifting off the ground just tell me
tell me what girl you need to bring it
back down I don't think
happen but never say never but please
bring me back down because I never want
to be like that
Aska says Jem we're all dying to know
what your hug your mom did yes sir my
mom lost the cooking contest yesterday I
talked about that in my livestream my
mom lost it was a mushroom festival in
Kennett Square Pennsylvania my mom lost
she forgot it and a garnish ingredient
but the last contest she was in she
rocked it and she knew everybody waved
she won so and then she's got one coming
up it's an oyster cook-off in Maryland
and then she's got the national food
championship she's going to so she's got

hugs no there's video evidence that I've
met indie Kitty one Jen hot mess mom I
know you're just wonderful I love
watching me thank you so much yeah I was
sad she didn't win because she made a
mistake and I think that's the hardest
loss is when you know you could have
done something to make it better and you
didn't for whatever reason so it kind of
stinks but there's so many other
contests she's always in cooking
contests all the time
ask me says that's a case so awesome for
her to even enter and put herself out
there yeah I mean she and that's her
thing if she enters cooking contest my
