the what's up and make up a weekly chat
I hope that you were doing well I can
tell that already my face is lagging
from my voice what okay if you're
watching this on the replay today we're
going to be talking about alters 21 days
of beauty but I cannot let it continue
like this because it looks horrible so
give me a second to see if I can fix the
the output because the the lag is
outrageous and I would really like to
continue to use this camera if I can
because it looks terrible
I have got it on medium so all I can do
is change it down to slow but then it's
gonna look
probably the quality is gonna go way
down this is terrible
okay so that looks like it's better for
me I'm hoping that it's better for you
good for me as it was for you so I don't
see that anybody is in like oh yeah
there are people here in live chat yay
welcome
so today I've got my handy dandy Ulta 21
days of beauty catalog here and let me
just to make sure I'm not an idiot I'm
gonna rip my address off the back
because I don't want anybody that me to
accidentally go oh look at the book and
then like my addresses like right there
um cuz it's livestream and I can't edit
it so I've got the 21 days of beauty
calendar in the front and if you don't
know about 21 days of beauty does it
what twice a year once a year twice a
year where every day they have different
sales it's almost like the Sephora
weekly Wow
but for a month are you not a much for
three weeks and it's pretty nice because
usually they have some really good stuff
on sale so let me go ahead and say hello
to the people in the collective brain
that are here thank you so much for
being here let me go ahead and scroll
down good morning - Julie good morning -
Liz morning Teresa and Becky and Mimi
and the gold digger in the house chris
is here at amber and days with Daisy
Abby is here good morning to you BMAC
Tian is here Monica
beauty 420 so happy to see you nerdling
full my tabatha hello to you good
morning everybody good morning wrench
wenches those are my moderate my chat if
you should calm chat moderators thank
you so much for being here chat
moderators I appreciate you you keep it
nice and calm good morning to our
fabulous reporter AJ thank you so much
for being here Holly is here and Aaron
and the Kennedy is here and if I did not
say hello to you good morning to you I
appreciate you okay so I'm gonna take a
sip of coffee because I need it and
we're just gonna start with today and
we're to go through everything and we're
give recommendations but it isn't just
about my recommendations because I
haven't tried everything and I'm only
one person it's about the communities
recommendations so let's talk about
today today we have the Tarte lights
camera lashes foreign one mascara for
ten dollars and the philosophy the micro
delivery exfoliating wash for $14 that
looks like a gigantic bottle look at
that that's crazy
okay so this is what I have to say about
this and then we'll talk about the talk
to the collective brain so the Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara is a really
nice mascara personally I wouldn't pay
full price for it unless I really just
wanted to invest in a in a mascara that
was high-end specifically but for ten
dollars I would definitely say lights
camera lashes is a great thing to get it
looks like I'm lagging again my wagon
again oh my gosh this camera I'm trying
to make it better quality you guys
hopefully it's going through okay so yes
I would say definitely for ten dollars
I think lights camera lashes is
definitely definitely worth it for
philosophy for philosophy skin care I
have found I don't know this particular
product but I have found overall with
the philosophy skin care products that
they're just not the ingredients just
aren't great I mean you'll have like the
typical based kinds of things like
glycerin and stuff like that you have a
lot of fragrance of course with
philosophy they dumped a ton of
fragrance in there and just not a lot of
great stuff especially with you know
with cleansers there's only so much
skincare you can put in the cleanser
really with a cleanser from my
experience and from my you know
search and everything what you're
looking for is something that's not
going to make your skin feel dry and
crackled out it's not gonna throw your
pH out of balance too bad but as far as
like really good like the stuff you
would look for in a serum it doesn't
really matter so much that they're in
cleanser you know what I mean so a
philosophy cleanser I might not hate on
as much as I would hate on not hate on
but not be a biggest fan of maybe some
of their other skincare stuff it's just
not but 14 dollars I mean if you're
looking for one if you I would
definitely recommend going in store and
smelling it because they're fragrant
that their stuff tends to be very highly
fragranced so Lisa says nice nail polish
collection thank you I have had most of
these nail polishes for five years plus
because I used to do a lot more nail
stuff on my channel than I do now
Oh Nicky Murphy in the house was hi
Nicky Murphy go check out her YouTube
channel if you're looking for a new
channel to check out and let's see what
the collective brain says about some of
these products I'm going to scroll up a
little bit let's see I need to get this
full screen so I can see there we go
okay let's see Banshee Muse says I have
a sample of the Tarte mascara but I
haven't tried it yet but nothing for me
today on sale you should try it and let
me know what you think Rosanna says
lights camera lashes is my Holy Grail
but I'd only get it on sale tabatha says
week one of the sales in the deals
section of today's show that's true and
what's up in makeup today we do if you
look in the time stamps if you want to
see all of our deals you can always go
to the time stamps and you will find all
of the 21 days of beauty deals there
that is very true hi Justin how are you
oh it's so good to see you thank you so
much for being here I know I've seen you
around Twitter we've had some some chats
Philomena says I really like the mascara
and the price is comparable to L'Oreal
yes I think definitely with Esopus price
I totally agree Nicki's looking for
super chat I have turned off the super
chat but thank you Nicki I have turned
it off I don't know if it will ever come
back they did talk about four super chat
bringing it back for charity things we
just something that I would consider
doing but the the cut that they take out
is absolutely insane for for charity
donation so I don't think I'll do it
unless there's something specific where
I can say it's for charity and they
don't take so much out Nikki says I want
a super chat where is it Jen oh thank
you Nikki no it's okay I'm we're good
we're solid thank you I was looking for
people saying anything about the
philosophy product okay so Melissa says
I think the philosophy cleanser is a
great daily exfoliator thank you so much
for that Melissa cuz I've never tried it
anything else about philosophy
there are Jen says there's other online
ads I don't know if there's other online
ads I didn't look on altas website today
but I do know that there are some hot
buys here on the next page that
hopefully we'll have a chance to talk
about okay let's move on to tomorrow
tomorrow on March 9th we've got the
Benefit Cosmetics 24 hour brow Center
and the it cosmetics bye bye pores
pressed anti-aging finishing powder
I would definitely a hundred percent a
hundred percent pick up the benefit
24-hour brow setter unless there's
something in the ingredients you're
allergic to I mean it's just it's so
good it's so good I actually brought it
over here because I had to show you this
is my favorite brow gel and the reason
why is because I'm kind of picky about
my brow gels if you don't know this
about me oh I should tell you the
benefit that tart so yeah one of the
prices Sara says like come on Jen okay
March 18th which is today the Tarte
lights camera lashes is ten dollars and
then the philosophy is $14 for today the
brow the benefit 24-hour brow Center is
$12 definitely recommend for this and
then the it cosmetics press is 1450 and
the regular price they're basically 50%
off but this is my favorite brow gel and
the reason why is I'm very picky about
textures on my face I don't like things
to be sticky or a gear or gloopy or hard
or anything and this is a great brow gel
because it's clear which I personally
like and also it it doesn't feel crunchy
in my brows but it still holds my brows
really really nicely I do have to tell
you this was sent to me in PR by benefit
no obligation to review but this I mean
you'll if you watch my I did do an
entire video
on the benefit brow products and you'll
see that there were some of them that I
definitely disliked in the benefit brown
line it isn't just because they sent to
me in PR because you'll see that in that
whole video when you see a comprehensive
thing but this is definitely one of my
favorite benefit brow products of all
time and one of my favorite brow gels of
all time definitely recommend this one
yet cosmetics bye-bye pores press now
with me I don't have very large pores so
I can't really speak to the getting rid
of the pores thing I can't I can't speak
to that I believe if I remember
correctly with this product it does
leave it does have a white color to it
so I'm not really sure whether that
would work for everybody because some
people their skin tone doesn't react as
well to a white toned product it can
make skin look ashy it can not look very
nice for me it does blend into my skin
very nicely but I don't know for
everyone on that one I would love to you
know the collective brains opinion on
the it cosmetics bye bye pores pressed
and if you're watching us on the replay
please leave comments in the in the
comments section so that we can learn
from you on your experience with some of
these products as well let's the EMA
says I'm not picky about my brow gel so
I don't think I can justify even $12
with my essence make me brow is it is
less than five dollars and I think that
that is very smart of you because I am
very picky but the essence one it's too
crunchy for me I can't take it I can't
do it I can't even do the anasazi wanna
I don't even like the ontology one
Heather says bye-bye pores powder I had
a sample and loved it then waiting to
restock ever since running out really
hides my pores thank you so much for
that I appreciate it Jane says I
switched the it cosmetics pressed powder
in Alta yesterday and it looked chalky
and had I switched i swatched is what
she meant the ax cos medics pressed
powder and all tsta and looked chalky
and heavy and it does in the swatch but
it does for me it blends out and I
thought you can't see a white cast or
anything it I don't know about photo
friendly I didn't take any photos but
yeah I'm curious to hear more
information about that from you all the
old sub releases hi Felicia
now Alta brow gel gets crunchy too yes
it does yes it does
yes I Bobby how are you Bobby thinks I
would love the colour-pop brow gel I've
never tried their brow gel good to know
honest says love the size of that mug
Jen you might as well be drinking it
straight from the carafe I know right I
love it too Steph says waiting for the
colour-pop one to come in I through the
color pop brow products in my order of
the spring collection nice you haven't
tried I tried a brow pencil from them a
long time ago the one that they first
came out with and I did not enjoy it all
right I need to keep going we're 11
minutes in and we're only two days in
all right March 20th which is Sunday
Monday Tuesday they don't have the names
on here the days of the week on here we
have the pure four in one pressed
mineral powder and then we have the
Clinique 3-step skin care starter kit so
that's right here and the pure up form
one pressed mineral powder is 1475 and
the Clinique is nine seventy five and
that was when I was also high I didn't
have a lot of time this morning so I
didn't have time to get the two products
out but the pure is one that I was able
to find quickly this is a really nice
powder I do like it just the same as my
Milani though so I can't like say that
this is something I think is worth
investing in at least for me and my my
experience I really like the Milani
press powder so money's well cuber even
a 1475 but if you were curious about
this I mean this gets rave rave rave
reviews but I mean it doesn't do
anything magical for me it does work
though it works fine it's a very nice
and oh I think this was set to me by
Pierre - boom sorry this was sent to me
by pure but they only sent me one
package and I didn't like a lot of it
this was probably one my favorite things
that I tried though out of the stuff
that they sent there are some things
they didn't really like but this is
definitely one of my favorites but again
it's comparable to some of my lower
priced products Emma says I have really
fair skin so I'm worried that Milani
would have a light enough shape for me I
believe they have a translucent one that
might be good for you okay so someone
asked the Clinique three-step skin care
kit I haven't tried much Clinic skin
care it says it's in French oh my gosh
it's so tiny
I can't even tell some kind of look I
can't even read this okay this is what
we're gonna do we're gonna cheat I'm
gonna take a picture of it with my phone
and then I'm gonna zoom it in this is
what I do all the time with ingredients
when I can't see as I'll take a picture
of it like that and then I'll zoom in
and see if I oh I can't read that can
you read that because I can't read that
Jamie says Clinique is great for young
skin nice yeah it's all blurry I have no
idea I'm sorry I don't know it's a
three-step skincare starter kit I can't
tell you anything about it because I
can't read it clarifying something I
have no idea I'm sorry
Sandra says the Clinique yellow
moisturizer has mineral oil thank you so
much for letting us know that Sarah says
Sarah Anne says Wayne Goss says he loved
the clinic three-step system great while
a I think Wayne Goss is fabulous
busy bee wants to know what I think
about Dermalogica x' micro foley ants i
haven't looked at the ingredients of it
and i don't believe i've tried that one
so i wish i had i don't like to say
things if i'm not 100% sure Sylvia says
Clinique has a lot of alcohol in there
face wash and toner i was using it for
the longest time ah definitely watch out
for alcohol or alcohol d mate those are
the bad ones een a tea with a period
next to it the abbreviation of denatured
alcohol those are the two you want to
stay away from when it comes to alcohol
because when you just it says alcohol
it's denatured alcohol there are some
good alcohols you don't need to worry
about C Dulce Tirol those are fine
there's nothing wrong with those those
are have functions within products that
we don't dry out your skin but denatured
alcohol will so definitely keep your eye
out for those all right I can't tell you
more about that so let's move on to
March 21st
bancini says I love the clinic acne
facial wash face wash nice mr. Ashton
says I cannot use the basic Clinic
3-step kit now though too harsh for me I
do like the anti gravity eye cream nice
Jen says Clinic toner is like pure
alcohol mmm and Joanne doesn't like the
Clinique three-step program she has oily
skin and it made her skin super dry
never again
okay Oh Monica says she's interested in
the Sephora news because she's pending
in the litigation the one about the pay
wow I mean I personally feel like if you
didn't see the news show today this is a
little off topic but didn't you see the
news show today there's a group of
Sephora employees that are suing Sephora
because it was a requirement for them to
touch up their makeup during the day and
to make sure they're wearing makeup
before and I don't know if I feel like
people should be compensated for putting
makeup on before work but if you're
required during the day to touch up your
makeup and that's part of your job I do
feel like anything that's a job
requirement you should be paid for but
coming to work with makeup on if that's
part of the requirement because it is
makeup place I don't know if that's
something that should be compensated for
but during the day I definitely with
touch-ups I think that that's smart too
- not smart but I think that's important
to be paid for that that's my opinion
anyway but good luck on that I hope that
it works out for you but I also didn't
ever work there so I don't know what
it's like to work that I've heard some
bad things about working at Sephora
actually mmm alright so let's move on to
March 21st Smashbox photo finish primer
water now sixteen dollars Proactiv
emergency blemish relief and skin
smoothing exfoliator is ten to twenty
dollars I guess depending on the
products these Smashbox photo finish
primer water that's been okay for me I
don't like to spray things in my face as
you know but it's worked just as well
for me as fix+ with spraying it on
shadows to make them more bold and I
have used it as a setting spray before
and it seems to work fine
it works good it's sixteen dollars I
think is a good price I don't think I
would ever pay thirty two dollars for a
primer water ever I think that that's
insane I think Smashbox is very much
overpriced for a lot of their stuff I
don't find Smashbox tough overall to be
of the best quality there are some
things I really like from Smashbox but I
can't even like $32 it seems outrageous
but for sixteen dollars I mean it does
compared to mac's fix+ so at least in my
you know for my uses for spraying it on
eyeshadow so I would say sixteen dollars
that's a good deal I would say to jump
that if you need something like that but
I don't think if you already own fix+ if
you already own the mist and fix if you
already own you know one of these other
you know setting sprays you don't
necessarily need it but if you only have
like actually I don't know the alcohol
content in the Smashbox I'm not sure I
was gonna say if you only have like the
L'Oreal or something that has a really
high level of alcohol you might want to
try the Smashbox but I don't know the
level of alcohol in the Smashbox
Stephanie says I wish the primer Iser
that's I wish that was the primer Iser
it's on sale yeah I don't know Steph
says the primer water doesn't really
stop oil but it it pits a nice fresh it
puts a nice finish to my foundation nice
let's see Marisa says I don't like it as
a primer but it's good as a setting
spray for my Olli skin nice there you go
yeah I mean I think that like primer
primer water honestly like I don't see
much difference with between primer
water and said like primer sprays and
setting sprays I know that there's
differences between like finishing
powder and setting powder but as far as
the sprays it seems like they're just
throwing everything in you know so I
just use them interchangeably and if
that's wrong and then I guess I'm wrong
but I do I use primer waters and setting
sprays interchangeably they don't seem
to be it doesn't seem to make any
difference for me you know I don't know
maybe I'm wrong weights my action says I
wouldn't pay $32 but I'm happy to get it
for 16 there you go that's kind of way I
feel about it I've had some people
talking about the Proactiv there was
somebody that said I missed it who it
was but they said that the Proactiv is
fabulous I have no experience with
proactive as you know my skin doesn't
have a whole lot of problems and things
so I don't I've never tried Proactiv I
have no experience with that Julie says
did you see the Gen nude matte liquid
lip colors a hot by 13 dollars at Ulta
for the duration of 21 days I did not
see that I'll still look and see if some
of the newer shades are there because I
already have so many of the first line
of them the first run of them
oh yay Sammy's here hi Valerie Gagne was
a new rose water spray and I really like
it and it's eight bucks nice Justin says
I like it to set the face and bring down
a powdery look and then dab over with a
velour puff it can be get tricky using
it as a primer if you sat direct your
face too much nice thank you so much for
that Justin appreciate that Nancy says
hi Nancy Nancy says Proactiv worked for
my kids for three months then stopped
working Oh
lash love Proactiv is very strong and
drying okay Diane says on the email I
got from Ulta regarding their 21 days of
beauty diamond and platinum guests for a
beauty steal ship free through April 7th
okay that is good to know thank you for
that Diana I appreciate it Amy B says
the Bremen did a video on the
differences and I'll get them backwards
if I try to describe them one is no
alcohol that melt everything
with alcohol is the with alcohol is the
final step to add longevity nice thank
you so much for that it will have to
check out Sabrina's video on it because
Sabrina is amazing I love me some
Sabrina so that's just my ignorance on
sprays because I don't use oh you the
mama faith so you know when you don't
use something you don't have as much
knowledge about it and I don't
personally use them unless I'm in a
pinch jessica says her published choice
works way better than proactive good to
know Julie says that the the
bareMinerals has 30 shades available and
nice off to check it out I mean like I
need another lip product like I need a
hole in the head
but I'll still check it out though and
see if anything stands out to me thank
you so much for that alright let's move
on to March 22nd the buxom full-on lip
creams are $10 each in the Clarisonic
Mia is $119 right here so as far as the
buxom z' i think the buxom lip creams
are one of those things that you either
really like or you really don't and I
think one of the things that you're
gonna have to really like is that minty
feeling the buxom lip creams white
Russian is the most famous shade if
you're looking for an iconic buxom lip
cream to try white Russian is the one
that's the one that used to be really
really popular everybody used to talk
about White Russian all the time
and that I do really enjoy White Russian
a lot it's a little bit thicker of a
gloss and it's got a cooling minty kind
of feel on the lips it's not plumping it
doesn't hurt or anything but it
definitely has a cooling feel so if you
don't like that you're not going to like
the bucks on lip creams they're not
sticky from what I remember they're not
very sticky I don't remember them being
sticky at home I do remember them
feeling a little bit thick though Jenna
says dolly is my fave yeah Dolly's a
really good one too
totally agree totally agree hello Laura
black diamonds and pearls loves the
buxom glosses Elise says hi Elise I just
had to get rid of my bucks a mudslide oh
that's just a good one too after not
even six months because the set went
south yeah that's not good and they do
have a scent to them they do oh man
thank you for being here Elise Elise
isn't one of another one of our reporter
extraordinaires
Krista says not sure if anyone mentioned
since I'm late but if you look online
all the deals are listed including
online only in platinum and diamond
diamond deals Thank You Krista I
appreciate you Jenny says I like dolly
more than White Russian good to know
okay Justin's talking about Clarisonic
so let's move on to Clarisonic he says
Clarisonic has changed my life in
capital letters gets everything out
especially if you struggle with deep
gunk and or black and blackheads highly
recommend and getting it from QVC is
always a steal on easy pay great to know
Justin thank you so much and I bought my
husband a Clarisonic I guess it was
maybe a year or two ago he used it for
like a month and then stopped using it
that's the only experience that I know
of Clarisonic is that my husband got
bored with it really quickly but he he
doesn't do the whole routine skin care
routines he doesn't really do all of
that so snot puppy fabulous name I
prefer the foreo to the Clarisonic good
to know justice as I wish Clarisonic had
a body attachment for the Mia -
anonymous vlogger I think the sales
start at 12 a.m. Central Time I do
believe it's 12 a.m. sometime midnight
yes hi Grady how are you my friends I
feel like I'm too pale for white rush in
such a bummer but what you can do Grady
well actually what you should do is buy
a shade that you think is better for you
but if you
wants it should do right White Russian
you can always use it as a lipstick
topper I've done that a lot and remember
they're not super opaque either they're
they're just like a light wash of color
too but you're right I mean me it might
it might wash you out it might randy
says why can't we get these men on their
skin routines I know I know I thought it
was just my man
[Laughter]
yeah weights my action says I use white
Russians to top or that's what I've used
it for in the past I don't think I own
it anymore
Cassie says I feel it's not as good this
time around as usual a lot of repeats
from prior 21 days yeah there's
definitely some repeats in here all
right I agree with you
all right March 23rd so this I believe
is Friday Urban Decay shadow singles $10
each exuberance zillions performance
peel AP 25 now 38 50 regular $77 I know
nothing about that product but Urban
Decay single eyeshadows I do really
enjoy them I find $20 to be outrageous
for a single eyeshadow outrageous unless
it is something that is so unique and so
out of the box that it's worth it
because you literally cannot find
anything anywhere close to it would I
ever consider spending $20 on a single
eyeshadow I think that's absolutely
insane but $10 $10 I could say I'm like
I might I might buy a couple at $10 if
there was something that stood out I
think that's a lot more reasonable so
Urban Decay single shadows are very nice
and what I would do if you had the time
was pop by Sephora and do some swatches
swatches and see what you think of the
colors and then buy medalta Beauty
because you can't I don't think you can
swatch them at mood well I don't know
some old us you can swatch and some of
them you can't but if you can't swatch
them some of them are pretty ordinary or
look up swatches I mean like Tim Talia
swatches if they I think like every
Urban Decay eyeshadow that's ever
existed I think Tim tell you guys a
swatch of it so you can look at that as
well that might be a little more
functional than going over to Sephora
and swatching if your altar doesn't have
swatches of the singles for Urban Decay
mr. Ashton says they did not say that
moons us were omitted moved us there's a
little weird for me there are more like
toppers I don't like toppers I'm not the
biggest topper fan so they're not my
favorites and I get a lot of fallout
from those out of Fallout Erica says the
exudes Pele is awesome that's great
because I have never even heard of this
product I have no idea what it is
I know nothing about it this is why we
need to do this video in the collective
brain because there's things I don't
know about mama bear says Tim Talia has
swatches of everything and the deets
I agree she's amazing I don't know how
she does it kg says moon dust irritated
my eyes no I mean it's it's real fluffy
Thom Talia is amazing I agree
iris loves life says buying 10 single
eyeshadows would be akin to a PMG
palette exactly exactly a Pat McGrath
palette exactly AJ says Urban Decay
singles that are in palettes are
different
I love T's in Naked 2 but hate the
single interesting cuz I've heard the
opposite about a lot of the singles that
the singles are better than the palette
but I mean it might vary by by single -
maybe they mess with some of the
formulas because packing it into the
palettes is sometimes different than
packing it into the packaging for a
single so sometimes they have to mess
with the formula a little bit so you're
not necessarily getting the exact same
formula in a single as you do in the
Anna palette so Mike's anonymous blogger
says my mom loved the exhuming spiel
well there you go
Jessica says does anyone know any good
acid products for keratosis pilaris i
Chen s says a lot of urban decay has
bismuth oxychloride I can't use it and
use their eye or powder products yeah
and that's one of those that it's it's I
just started talking about it because
people in the collective brain told me
about it and I didn't realize because it
wasn't coming up as a red flag on ewg I
didn't realize you know that people were
having trouble with it but it's
something about the crystalline
microstructure of bismuth oxychloride
that it basically it just scratches some
people's skin because it's like little
crystals almost like the the micro
structure of it so it can irritate
people's skin
and that's my thought went if you've
ever seen Noddy who did a review of the
box and crayons that I did a review of I
think he's allergic to bismuth
oxychloride
I do that's what that's what I dr. Jen
that's sarcastic dr. Jen by the way that
I'm not being literal that's what dr.
Jen would would recommend is him to
check out bismuth oxychloride because
there's a lot of it than those box of
crayons I chose Lisa finds the Urban
Decay has too much fallout interesting
don't you know Portland adventure reader
says good to know about urban decay
eyeshadow Jen s they always hurt my eyes
Wow okay all right so let's move on to
March 4th our 24th March 24th okay so
we've got quite a few things what looks
like it's mo it's teyla and philosophy
so we've got the Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner for $11
you've got some philosophy purity cloths
30 count micellar water makeup remover
claws for seventeen fifty two eleven
dollars and then Benefit Cosmetics free
brow wax regular $21 okay so oh so the
purity clause or the my solar water
they're 1750 to eleven dollars so
there's two purity products in the shape
so you got the Stila we've got to purity
products and then the brow wax for free
this Stila okay Stila stay all day I
used to love this I remember going from
my sister-in-law's birthday and going to
Ulta we walked over we'd spent the day
together and I bought her Stila stay all
day for her birthday and she was so
happy and she loved this thing and then
the more I use it the more I found it to
be a little bit runny compared to like
the the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper compared to the NYX well now now
compared to the next epic ink I hadn't
tried it back then the Jessie's Girl
liquid eyeliner there are so many of
them that don't get a little liquidy on
me like the Sela does the steel I feel
like when I first get it is fabulous but
then I feel like the more the older it
gets it starts like oozing into my fine
lines in my eye so I have to use a brush
like a liner brush to kind of smooth out
the oozes when and then it's fine then
it's fine it's very very black it
all day on me unless I H the sides of my
eyes then it's really easy to get the
the liner off if I go like this by
accident but overall I mean it's a it's
a good liner but I eleven dollars I
think that might be worth trying if
you're interested it might be worth
trying but I honestly like the NYX epic
Inc better I have to say 1750 for a box
of cloths I think I said that wrong okay
750 its 750 for the purity clause 30
count and then the micellar water looks
like it's 11 dollars that's what my
guess is I am I used to use makeup
remover cloths all the time that was my
thing I used to get the big huge box of
the ones at Costco they were like a blue
package that they were supposed to be
like the Neutrogena ones but they were
the the Costco brand I love those things
but my problem with that is is that I
feel like it says on there that you're
supposed to just you can just wipe your
makeup off and go but you're leaving all
of those chemicals on your face for lack
of a better word I know there's probably
a better word than that but like there's
there's a lot of times there's alcohol
in those and I personally don't feel
like it's a great idea to leave that
stuff on your face because unless
there's some serious skin benefits in
the in the cleansing cloth which usually
there isn't I don't like cleansing claws
I don't think that they're they're
convenient but they don't there's a lot
of rubbing involved a lot of times
because you're the cloth doesn't
necessarily have enough liquid on it
sometimes depending on the cloth where
you have to rub I makeup
some people will use like an oil based
cleanser first and then a cleansing
cloth but they're just not my favorite
way to take makeup off and to clean my
face my personal preference is to use an
oil based cleanser and then a foaming
cleanser afterward the double cleanse
method is my favorite way so I mean a
lot today aren't I I apologize for my
arms but yeah so I don't I did it again
I don't really like cleansing claws in
general and that's just my personal
opinion you have a hundred percent right
to disagree with me and love your
cleansing cloths i we can disagree on it
and I will still love you it's okay
my pack says Cleansing Cloths
tend to cause spread of bacteria I did
not know that I don't know anything
about that I I don't know that a lot of
people are saying the double cleanse
method yeah I mean it works great for me
and sometimes like if I don't wear
makeup I'll just do the I'll just do the
foaming cleanser if I don't wear makeup
I usually only use the oil-based
cleanser if I wore makeup that's just me
okay so that's my opinion on that and
then my solar water I do enjoy my solar
waters I think micellar waters are great
but I don't know the alcohol content in
it that would be the only thing that
would keep me away also the the
fragrance content if that's something
that bothers you then you may want to
look for philosophy with with them which
call it with alcohol contact with
fragrance and alcohol content with flat
with all philosophy products let's see
what the let's see what the collective
brain is saying Stacy says I like the
old a cleansing cloths that are dry that
you wet and then they soap up followed
by micellar water nice wings ballerina
OSHA time at the persona palette we'll
get to that I have an opinion on that
christina is here from Chris Anna and
cosmetics hello Chris Anna Ellen is here
I use a cleansing cloth but then follow
it with the micellar water there you go
so that seems to be a maybe that's why
they pair them together it seems like
that's something that a lot of people
here are doing Clubman cloths dry my
skin Sylvia says aqua siren I always
wash my wash after using a cleansing
cloth I wash my face is probably what
she meant yeah but it says on there no
need to wash off so for years I did not
I did not wash it off
IV double cleanses Chrissy hates
cleansing claws black diamonds and
pearls I use wipes if I'm lazy and
taking a nap but I always double cleanse
nice
yeah persona palette we'll talk about
for Sona palette I don't think I have
that within easy reach I think that's
over in my drawer over there okay so a
benefit brow bar I personally love the
benefit brow bar if you can get a
benefit brow wax for free I would
definitely recommend going over and
getting your brows done I definitely try
to call ahead make an appointment and
and try to get your brow wax there
because I love get my I mean this may be
just mine cuz everybody's DIF like
saying you know go to so-and-so place
and get your hair cut but you live in
this state
person lives in the state so there's
different people doing it but I've had
nothing but positive experiences at the
benefit brow bar at Ulta I can't say the
same for their hair I had some terrible
experiences with their hair place the
hair doing whenever my hair look really
really bad it was because I was going to
alter right after my red one out and my
hair was super brassy I had some
terrible experiences with the Ulta hair
salon but I've had great experience with
the brow the brow bar brow bar has been
great so definitely recommend checking
that out if you are looking for a new
place to get your brows done especially
for free but I found that it made my
brows last longer because what they do
that's different than like a you know
just go to a random nail shop a is that
they they really spend a lot of time
perfecting your brows where when I go to
nail shop a they just take the wax they
rip it off take the wax rip it off take
the wax here rip it off okay by you know
ten dollars and it's like okay but at
benefit the benefit brow bar they really
take their time which I very much like
so let's go ahead and move on to march
25th which is next Sunday we still have
oh good so maybe we'll be able to get
through one more week I don't think were
gonna be able to get through the whole
thing or you know what let's go ahead
and skip over to the the Hot Buys
because these are on sale everyday let's
talk about that I'm going to skip over
to this page here because we want to
know what's happening right now and then
if we have time we'll go back to the
other page here and maybe we'll do
another one of these maybe we'll do
another one of these next week that
might be a good idea and then we'll I
don't know we might have to have two
topics because I don't think we can fill
up a whole hour on just that so we've
got oh maybe we can talk about what you
guys bought I don't know
all right tart Ready Set radiant skin
mist is now $15 I've never tried that so
I can't really speak to that what does
the collective brain think of that the
tart
ReadySet radiant skin mist I don't know
anything about that the lorac Pro matte
and satin lip colors those are I like
lorac lip colors I feel like lorac lip
colors are very underrated very
underrated I don't know why no one talks
about lorac lip colors $11 each def
might be worth picking up one or two and
trying them out Julia says don't forget
online sales are not in the paper and
that's definitely something I should
look up today I will go online if we
have time and we'll look it
we'll look it up Oh Emma Emma Hall Pack
one says the Bratz free browses with a
$50 purchase that oh I did not see that
oh because it's got little they tricked
me with the Stars
you know how they got the Stars and you
got to follow the stars but the start oh
it says while quantities last no rain
checks every V view with $50 benefit
cosmetics product or service purchase oh

say Java says curse you asterisks I
agree I agree
Oh Jess is here hi Jess Jen says she's
talking to Jess - big mascot about to
investigators I love two big mascaras
I've bought one a long time no Krista
says hi Krista she says the chart skin
mist is okay it makes my skin sticky I
think it's more like a fixed plaster
Smashbox primer water than an urban
decay setting spray see girl you know so
much more about the stuff than I do I
can't even for five minutes I can't do
it on my face Bonnie says the chart
setting spray makes you very glowy and
do be probably great for dry skin but
not for me personally with my oily skin
good to know Michelle i'ma show she's
another contributor to our
Hunter's group tarp mist was man good to
know thank you so much for that I
appreciate it
okay Oh a couple people hi Mimi a couple
people asking about the lorac Pro 3 is
that in here
the lorac pro 3 did I don't think I have
the lorac pro 3 I think that was the
goldish one i have the one which is the
black the two which is the blue the
three i don't think i own that one i
think that's the one that i don't have I
don't have that one yeah I can't speak
to it but I like the lorac Pro formula
overall very much
hey girl hi okay so let's talk about the
malli beauty shaped shimmer shape and
glow I'm really surprised they even
still oh no not malli I was thinking of
something else
I was thinking of Fiona Styles for some
reason Maui is one of those brands like
I don't even know how they still exist
because their products really aren't
very good in my experience like my Maui
stuff just not good they do have a
parent company so I think the parent
company must be keeping them alive but
they were I felt like their stuff was a
lot better when Molly was running it I
feel like even like now things are just
crash and burn with Nally products I've
never tried this product particularly
though you show you what it looks like I
haven't tried that but I haven't I don't
know what's going on with Molly they
need they need a whole revamp Claudia
says I like the Mallee shadow sticks
I've had good luck with the Mallee
shadow sticks I'm with you but that's
one of the few products that I don't
really like that I that I do like that's
one of the few products that I do like
Monica wants to know about the pure
mystery bags oh my gosh girl the pure
mystery bags turned out to be it's again
Gupta house okay the the supposedly it
was five My Little Pony glosses and then
a highlighter palette everybody got the
same thing from what I heard it was all
of my little pony glosses and all these
women who don't want my little pony
stuff some women love my little pony but
some women don't want my little pony
that I saw it might have been men - I
didn't see any men the only people I saw
were women they're like I am 45 years
old I do not want my little pony
stuck with hope he's my little pony lip
toppers I'm sure they were a man that
were upset as well but I'm glad I didn't
get it because that's not cute in my
opinion I would have been upset too
yeah I heard but that's that's that's
the that's the the the risk you take
with those mystery bags it's it's it's
like a lot slot machine you know you
don't know what you're gonna get you
know so butter LONDON blazing blush
Julie I've never tried these but butter
LONDON I've had bad luck with their
cosmetics but I've never tried this
product so I don't know their nail
polish doesn't really Wow me either so I
don't know Emma says going Scoob a bunch
of my little pony glosses sounds like it
didn't sell too well yeah and that's
what a lot of these mystery boxes are
there things that didn't sell well the
only mystery boxes that I have
absolutely loved where I was like yes
are the julep ones and the bareMinerals
ones those have been wonderful for me
the other ones like I got a two-faced
one there's a live stream one on my
channel somewhere I'm what mm-hmm
I ended up giving away almost all of it
Julie says mystery bags are like a box
of chocolates you up but at least with
chocolate you kind of have an idea
you're going to get something with
chocolate which is always a good thing
kind of new here says the butter LONDON
eye glosses are fun to play with nice
Emily says lipstick Queen thoughts I
really love I saw that Frog Prince is
there I love my front Prince lipstick I
think it's a beautiful Bobby pink shade
it's gorgeous
i I don't like all lipstick I think
lipstick Queen is extremely overpriced
so if you can get lipstick Queen at a
discount I definitely recommend it
especially that April 4th Frog Prince
for 1250 that's a really nice lipstick
it's a it's a nice wash of color to that
Jordan the fade down on it is really
really good I love my Frog Prince
lipstick personally don't get the lip
gloss though lip gloss you'll end up
with green glitter on your lips for like
hours it doesn't go away and the color
goes away and then you're stuck with all
the green glitter well I did a full
review of that stuff a long time ago
very long time ago but you can check the
channel for that if you want to if
you're curious NES Ellis about the
butter LONDON
glaze and blush eg Lee's because I don't
know anything about that
let's see Monica says butter LONDON i
swatched oh oh she take she took it away
fine Monica I won't read it then
Michelle says butter glosses don't work
for crepey or mature eyes good to know
amb says medieval lipstick clean is so
pretty nice
Azra butter LONDON shadows are
underrated and the newer lipstick
formulas beautiful and has a magnet cap
nice I love the magnet caps the face
says not all boxes of chocolate are
created the same that is very true
there's some junk chocolate out there I
you're right I stand you're always right
with Bay I'm always right
I've known Lupe for years years Lupe how
long have I known you my online friend
how long have I known you a long time
Naomi says old to stop calling carrying
her butter LONDON a carrying butter
LONDON her store interesting CJ says
let's be honest makeup is all overpriced
well I don't think but yeah I mean the
mark-up is pretty crazy ok so the next
one is the lipstick Queen oh wait no the
laura geller
a new york spackle collection my aunt
swears by the spackle the original
spackle I find it to be ok it's a it's a
nice primer it works for me I haven't
tried the Mist but I do like the regular
spackle
it isn't as silicon E as let's say a
Smashbox it seeps into the skin a little
bit better than that but it does I do
believe it does have some silicon in it
but it isn't quite as slippy I like the
spackle but I've never tried the spackle
mist they're on sale from $13 to $19 and
this is every day and then the lipstick
wheat st. sheer lipstick and Center bold
lipstick $14 each that's tempting for me
that's tempting for me I don't own those
but that's tempting for me because I do
really like their lipstick formula
japonesque who Midori metallic eye
pencil trio and Velvet Touch
trio I've never tried japonesque eye
pencils they're $12 each I thought
japonesque was like a drugstore price am
i wrong there
there usually it says regular $20 each I
thought japonesque was less expensive
than that Oh No
yeah lipstick queen is very expensive
Ezra says ugh I hate spackle breaks at
my foundation like cottage cheese good
to know it's never done that to me but
we all have different skin so thank you
for saying that because there are
probably people that are just like you
Naomi said let me get my catalog out of
the recycling Randy Randy and Cindy
Baker I used to use that spackle I can't
remember it was good but this spray is
the spray is high I'm not sure what that
means the spray is high sorry mr. Ashton
says they are pretty Jen those two
lipstick queen colors don't tell me that
tell me that you don't mean me by that
ma do I need them no Oh Amanda and Julie
are both saying japanesse has always
been expensive it's in the drugstore
section but also but they're not cheap
well maybe that's why I thought that
they were less expensive hmm Judy says
Jen can you comment on Ulta brand deals
to 50% off eye products this week okay
Ulta is definitely Ulta brand is
definitely a broad a brand that's very
hit-or-miss for me I did have a full
video on the Ulta brand if you search
gemelas reviews an Ulta brand review
you'll be able to find it and see some
of that stuff
the problem with Ulta brand is they are
constantly getting rid of things and
getting new things in so it's really
hard to keep up with them because
they're they're constantly changing it's
like I buy something and then three
weeks later you can't even get it
anymore like I got their color-changing
drops and I really really loved them and
I was gonna do a review of them and then
they were gone and they didn't sell them
anymore so it's like well I guess I
can't review them now what a waste you
know I still use them but I really like
them same thing with a foiled eyeshadow
palette I got from Ulta brand absolutely
loved it
as soon as I went to go review it couple
weeks after I bought it you couldn't
even buy it anymore so that's my big
issue with all two brand and that I
can't even really speak to the things
that are there now because they're
constantly change
over their products it drives me bonkers
makes me really mad but if you can find
your shade or if you're willing to use
color change and drops the foundation is
very very good the matte foundation it's
really really good if you can find their
foiled eyeshadows I don't know the full
shadow pout that I have by Ulta brand is
really really good but those are the
only ones that I can even like because
they get rid of stuff drives me nuts
ambe's to the Ulta brand eyeshadow
primers fantastic yes exactly the nude
matte one it is almost an exact dupe for
the Urban Decay primer potion and Eden
the nude matte one it is a little bit
less opaque than the Urban Decay one but
you can use them interchangeably there
it's very good the eyeshadow primer
totally agree Valerie says they're
hydrating primer is so nice but it's $18
is all too brand cruelty free I don't
want to say that it is but I don't know
I don't know I think that's something we
would have to google figure it out when
they say I'm gonna google it right now
because I have to know now Ulta brand
makeup crew

okay let me go back over to you Katie
says yes and they've started to mention
some products being vegan that's awesome
Thank You Katie
hi Katie how are you okay so we just
left off with japanesse let's go to the
pure miracle mist now ten dollars I
don't know anything about that product
what's up with all the setting sprays
man all setting sprays and the Primus
sprays and all that stuff oh I don't
like that stuff
bareMinerals Jen nude statement matte
liquid lip color I love my Jen nudes the
thing about the genuine this is if
you've never heard me talk about Jen
nudes I'll give you my quick rundown on
the barrels Jen use they smell like
pudding like chocolate pudding they
smell amazing they do not dry down they
they always have a lip sticky kind of
like a very moist lipstick II kind of
feel on the lips not very moist but
they've got like a when you rub your
lips together you can feel the product
like almost like if you have like a lip
balm or a lipstick on it you can feel
them the your lips kind of slipping
a little bit but the lipstick is very
opaque it goes on beautifully the wear
down of most of them there's one shade
called cookie that I
like that I feel it goes on patchy but
other than cookie I really really like
all of my genuine liquid lipsticks just
because of the the wear down of them is
very very even the color application is
beautiful they smell amazing in my
opinion if you're looking for something
different the the em cosmetics ones are
almost nearly formula dupes they're
almost exactly the same in formula if
you ever want to try em cosmetics if
you're curious about that but the bare
minerals ones they're they're my
favorite comfortable liquid lipstick
they do not make your lips feel dry
they're actually quite hydrating they
feel very good but again that you're not
going to get the dry down that you would
with them more drying liquid lipstick so
that's just me that's that's the way I
feel about it
oh we've got a lot of people thing about
the persona palette we never talked
about the persona palette we're even is
that and even see it in here but hold on
a minute
let me let me finish this and then we'll
go to the persona so because I'm out of
order here so a Benefit Cosmetics
professional matte rescue I have not
tried the matte rescue I do like the
original professional works great and
then the julep when pencil-neck gel
long-lasting gel eyeliner nine dollars
each I think is a great price for those
I do like the julep gel liners I like
them more for not in the eye but on top
of the eye I like them as like top above
my lash liner I find it on the lower
lash line I do find that it does kind of
seep down and give me like that raccoon
I think which I don't like so depending
on what you are going for if you want
like a nice pencil liner for above your
lash line then definitely but not if
you're trying to tight line or if you're
trying to go on your lower lash line
unless you're planning on putting it
like on the outside of your lower lash
line kind of thing and then the Smashbox
always on gel liners I don't have much
experience with those if I do I don't
remember they're $10 each they've gotten
a lot of the same kind of stuff it seems
like it's a lot of eyeliners and setting
sprays and primer mists and stuff like
that interesting okay so let's talk
about the persona palette so the persona
palette is flippin fantastic for more
calm looks definitely if you're looking
for big punchy pops of color you're not
going to get
from persona palette but if you're
looking for a long all-day wear of a
nice more wearable calm I shadow look
for someone palette is fantastic it's
really really good it's over in my thing
way over there and actually let me go
get it because I feel bad let me go get
it because I know exactly where it is
it's just far away let me take my
microphone off one I'll be right back
I can't find it I'm so mad I thought I
knew where it was but it's not there the
only other place it could be is up there
I'm so mad sorry

from Becca on deeper skin and doesn't
seem as moisturizing thank you so much

much for being here I appreciate it
so if maybe what we'll do is next week
we'll come back through and we'll go
through then we'll do this again but for
next week and the following week and
we'll just focus on those two weeks
because I felt like I learned a lot from
this conversation if you're watching
this on the replay definitely leave your
thoughts in the comments below so we can
all learn from you and the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness and let's
all work together on this because we
want to make sure we work together and
make sure we're buying the stuff that's
worth our time were there money we're
skipping the things that are terrible
that we don't need to be buying
and the best way to do that is to work
together Julie says look at page three
why am I looking at page three one two
three first time ever by over 15 fan
favorite brands buy three get one free
mix-and-match free item must be of equal
lesser value to the lowest priced item
includes promotional value blah blah
blah okay so it looks like it doesn't
say the list of the names though of the
brands you guys see this so I see on
here Smashbox I see Tarte I see Stila
buy three get one free Mario Badescu
benefit butter LONDON Clarins

wonderful week this week on the channel
