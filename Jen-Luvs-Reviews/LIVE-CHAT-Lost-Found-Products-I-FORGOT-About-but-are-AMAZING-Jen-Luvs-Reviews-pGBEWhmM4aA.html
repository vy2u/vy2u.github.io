up and makeup chat it is so good to see
you I'm excited about today's topic I
always have trouble figuring out what I
want to chat about because I guess it
was maybe two years ago I've been doing
this live chat at least three years
maybe even four years I've been doing a
lot of chat every Sunday and it's like
it's hard to think of new things and I
look actually to you know my friends
channels for inspiration and last week
Lauren my beauty who is more of an
acquaintance of mine I don't know her
very well but she had inspired the chat
for last week and flipping through
channels flipping new channels and I
couldn't just couldn't find anything and
I was like you know what I have so many
products that I have kind of lost in my
collection even though they're really
good for one reason or another and I
want to talk about kind of why I feel
like these products are kind of getting
pushed to the back I mean of course you
know I do a review makeup so a lot of
the things that I'm using on the daily
are things that I'm working on for a
review but I'm not always reviewing
let's say a foundation or a concealer or
something like that
I'm not always reviewing you know those
kinds of things but like eyeshadow and
stuff like that I'm like constantly on
the grind like on the grind like that's
hard to do I'm constantly testing on new
eyeshadow palettes a lot of eyeshadow
palettes don't get used but there's one
bit like I haven't been using it Oh even
though they're really really good so I
wanted to highlight some of those
products for you today I do want to I
get a lot of comments about my voice and
how my voice changes from video to video
I'm very tired today so I've got the
tired voice I don't have a lot of energy
today I'm just gonna lay that out there
so I can feel it in my like whole body
that I'm like on a level that's like
down here I've got my coffee though I've
got my coffee I've got my movie mug if
you know where movie is from you've got
to let me know that you know where this
is from because this mug is very close
to my heart I was in the deleted scene
naturally it seems but I was in like the
extra scenes for this movie if you look
very closely if you know what this movie
is and you go into the extras on the DVD
there is like a Q&amp;amp;A section or whatever
and I'm any audience in the front row in
a pink sweater for this movie so if you
know what this is
not many people probably will and that's
okay I still love you even if you don't
know what it is but anyway alright
before we get going this is a live chat
so I am going to be talking to the
people in the community and I personally
love that because I get input from
people that are in the community this is
not this this chat isn't about me and
well it is about me but it's not all
about me it's about the community and
having a discussion and talking about oh
my gosh some people actually know oh my
gosh the other thing they know what it
is I'm not gonna spoil it though but you
get a serious like Internet cookie I'm
gonna give you a cookie if you knew what
that was from Oh somebody's saying it's
a low-volume is it just because I'm
talking quiet or is it yeah there's so
many people that know what it is I can't
even believe that I'm shocked I'm
absolutely shocked but um but anyway oh
my gosh see that's how I'm so
scatterbrained
so anyway I'm gonna be talking to people
from the community some people don't
like that that's perfectly okay and I'm
sorry if you don't like that I'm really
sorry but I feel like I learn a lot from
people in the community and I feel like
other people in the community do enjoy
videos like this so if you don't like it
I've got really great videos coming up
this week but I'm very excited about so
hopefully you'll enjoy those a little
bit more oh and I also want to let you
know if it's a little dark behind me I
broke my back light I broke the bulbs
they're broken they shattered everywhere
so I need to get new light bulbs they're
like big giant like swirly bulbs that I
need to go to the hardware store again
so alright some people are saying the
volume is fine so that's good some
people are saying Julie says she can't
hear it hmm okay let me see if I can
mess with the volume just a little bit
because I want people to be able to hear
the volume is all the way up let me see
advanced audio properties I don't want
to mess it up
it says max volume mic volume is at 100
I can turn it up to like 110 does that
help
maybe that'll help a little bit I'm just
talking a little bit quieter today so
maybe if I turn it up to like 115
hopefully that helps some I don't know
if that makes a big difference or not
but keep me up so Erica says she still
having trouble with the volume - yikes
see I don't know does it sound like the
mic is on or do you do does it sound
like the mica is honored you hear a lot
of
and Weiss when you turn your head it
didn't get louder which is strange
because it usually does weird okay this
says her volumes all the way up okay
weird okay try try exiting out and going
back in okay Bobby says big difference
okay alright we're all good now okay my
laughs Mike is definitely plugged in I
tested it before thanks tab I appreciate
it it's definitely plugged in okay
alright alright it seems like
everybody's good okay so let's go ahead
and get started let's start with like
face products first and then we'll work
our way up I didn't get had any primers
I just realized I could have gotten out
primers but I didn't okay so this is the
elf Moisture moisturizing foundation
stick and this is this was my Holy Grail
foundation for like three or four months
and I kind of stopped using it and I
don't know why because it's stinking
amazing this I was trying when I was
trying a lot of stick foundations and I
wish I'd done this video but I actually
ended up returning the hourglass stick
foundation I think I have the honest
Asya one around somewhere I didn't like
either one of those but I really liked
this one this is amazing my biggest
critique of this is there aren't that
many shades and it sometimes it's hard
to find like it kind of goes in and out
like at one point I thought it was
getting discontinued but then now then
it came back and oh good Kelly says that
she came back out when I gotten in and
now it's fixed good okay oh I forgot to
say hello is Julie oh my gosh I did
forget to say hellos Thank You Julie for
reminding me I'm gonna go ahead and say
hellos real quick because I know it
means a lot some people all right
Christina is here good morning from
Alberta Canada
she is currently healing from a
tonsillectomy so this live chat is a
great distraction all big hugs gentle
hugs gentle hugs Mon 420 Beauty good
morning to you welcome back
hello to Julie hello to Rachel and
Banshee news and Lisa and Erin and Julie
m and Jess with her purple hearts and j9
and Angelo Angeles oh I like that and
Shelby and pooja and Sandra and Abby and
Elise welcome Elise Hanna Karen J minx
29 Missa two zero two zero nine zero
Consuelo and Linda and Charlotte and
anybody else that I did not say hello to
good morning to you okay let's go ahead
and
hello to everybody oh my gosh so good to
have you guys here
so let me go ahead and keep going with
this so this is a medium it can be built
up to more of a full coverage foundation
it just looks really beautiful on the
skin it is my favorite elf product of
all time by far because I feel like it
truly mimics higher end product if not
better and you can put it down to more
of a lighter coverage if you want just
by kind of putting some streaks on it
it's really really a nice product I
really like this a lot so if you can get
your hands on this I definitely
definitely recommend it alright moving
on to face powder this is a face powder
that I keep neglecting and I don't know
why this is the photo bomb by the balm
this is a really really good powder
foundation I like this for not only kind
of mattify my face it doesn't do like a
super matte it's more of like a satin
matte kind of finish it's not like flat
and matte but it beefs up the coverage
of my foundation so like if I'm wearing
a lighter BB cream or foundation it's
like it just doesn't seem like it has
enough coverage but I don't want to take
on more foundation this is a great way
to add more coverage without taking more
more product on that's like a cream
product so I really really like this I
feel like it helps my it helps my makeup
stay on longer as well it increases the
longevity of my makeup and I really like
this a lot this was sent to me by the
balm though by the way I always want to
make sure I tell you when something was
sent to me that it didn't pay for but
I've pretty much the entire the balm
collection of two videos on my the balm
collection I have an old one and then I
didn't updated one if you're curious
about products from the balm I've pretty
much tried everything pretty much almost
everything almost everything so this is
definitely a recommend Melissa wants to
know you have a Holy Grail video for
this year yes I am going to do a favor
my favorites and fails this month is
going to be for 2017 the worst products
I tried this year all the way up to the
best products I tried this year we're
going to work on that next week if not
the following week it just kind of
depends what I can fit in this week my
big priorities week is getting that
Anasazi Beverly Hills versus the blah I
always forgot what it's called the shop
hush
shop hush I always have to say shop hush
and then eventually it gets to me oh
here they are here's a couple of things
what does it call bad habit bad habit so
I that's my number one priorities
getting that out too as soon as possible
but Phineas taking me forever when you
see it and you see all the little things
I put in it you'll know why it's taking
me forever to do it all right next thing
it's kind of a weird one
these are shadow shield shadow shields I
did an a what the K I used to do this
Korean beauty series called what the K
it was so fun I love that series I was
sad when I had to discontinue it it was
kind of one of those things I kind of
had to cancel the series just because I
don't like television when something
isn't getting a lot of use you have to
cancel it and put something else in its
place that's kind of what happened with
what the K people that loved what the K
have been asking me so much to bring it
back and I do want to bring back some of
them because I really do love it
I absolutely love it Oh Joanne says elf
has free international shipping and some
stuff on sale less than half price right
now oh that's awesome and Deana says hi
from Maryland hello neighbor
so anyway shadow shields actually ended
up seeing that video and they sent me
real shadow shield because I
accidentally bought the fake dupe
version of the shadow shields and I
didn't mean to so yeah Jeana wants to
know why is it so important to share
something was sent to you and your
subscribers really clear like does it
make them mad if you don't seriously
wonder not intending to mean let me
finish with shadow shields and then I'll
talk about that so shadow shields is
these are really good for catching
fallout under your eyes so what you do
is you have these stickers here so you
peel this off on the back see if I can
show you so you peel that off and then
you stick it under your eyes my big
complain about shadow shields is they're
very very very sticky so when you put
them on what I do is I only take off
this layer I keep this one on and it
kind of here I'll do it right now I'll
just do this one because they're not
they're not very expensive you can get a
whole box I think for like eight bucks
or something like that and then they
have the mini boxes they saw I think I
saw them at Walmart but these boxes
aren't very expensive so what you do is
you put them like this and you line them
up underneath your eye and you'll feel
it as soon as you put it on that it's
very very sticky so you see how gentle I
was putting that on and then it catches
all the fallout see I
don't need to put take the tape off of
this side because it kind of creates
this little wall here which is very very
nice and then when I pull it off it can
see it pulls if I don't push it on very
hard it doesn't pull it my undereyes but
if I press it on like it will pull at my
skin I don't know if it's gonna show my
hand since my hand skin is very tough
but it it really pulls at the under-eye
skin so just be careful how much you
press on this or what you can do is do
what I just didn't kind of take a little
bit of the stick you off and then press
it on as hard as you want and it won't
stick as hard so that's that's an option
as well but these are really really
great and I always forget to use them
and I don't know why okay so as far as
the disclaimer thing I think it's very
important to tell people when something
was sent to me because number one for a
lot of people it's very difficult to
separate when a brand sends them
something it's difficult for them to
separate their own feelings like this
was a gift and you know we're all we're
all taught from very small children that
when someone gives you a gift you say
thank you very much and you don't say
anything negative that's what I teach my
children you know we just went to
Hanukkah at my brothers and before we
went I said if you get a gift and you
are not crazy about it you do not tell
them you don't like it you do not tell
them you know that your you have already
have it you say thank you very much and
that's all you say you know you don't
lie but you don't say you know oh this
is the worst present ever so we're
taught that from a very young age
because it's rude when someone gives you
a gift to be like I don't even like this
can you imagine so I think when
influencers get PR at least for me when
I first start getting PR it was
difficult for me because I wanted to
maintain a relationship with the brand's
at this point I I care about the brands
of course you know I mean that I care
about the people and their feelings
they're real people but at the same time
you know it's almost like being a movie
reviewer the movie reviewers who get
free movie tickets they don't feel the
need to be you know say oh this movie
was great because I got a free movie
ticket and that's kind of the way that I
feel about this and if a brand doesn't
ever send me PR again I don't care
I get do not care because I can get PR
from someone else or I can buy stuff it
doesn't matter to me so a lot of people
really care about when things are
closed brightly so when something was
given to them so I feel the need to make
sure I tell you when something was sent
to me I think that it's important I
don't know if all of my subscribers care
but I know that some people do so
therefore I try to do it I try to I try
to always tell if something was sent to
me because maybe some people don't
realize that I don't care if a brand
ever sends me anything ever again
because if they're if they don't value
my honesty and then I don't want to work
with them anyway you know what I mean
like why would I want to work with
somebody that doesn't value that I'm
being honest about their products I'm
just trying to help you know they don't
want to take my advice behind I don't
have a reviewer on this channel there's
a couple of brands that I feel like I
don't see I don't want to talk trash
about different brands but they're like
I was thinking this morning I was
picking out products and it's like I
don't even want to use this product
because I feel like every time I met
this brand like okay I'll just say so
like I have nothing against is you a
personally okay but every time I've met
them in an event I feel like they have
no interest in talking I mean like they
brush me off
same thing with cover effects not cover
effects not cover effects nude sticks
even though I really like their pencils
they I feel like nude sticks that has no
interest in talking to me none of that I
get the same vibe from jouer and maybe
it's just a vibe maybe it's not real
maybe it's all my head but those are two
brands you a and nudes nudes sticks I
want to make sure I say the right brands
I just don't feel like they're
interested in anything I have to do so I
don't really care about reviewing their
products very much that's why you never
sees you am i Pro on my channel was it
pure pure sent me something one sent me
a box once but I've gotten that same
vibe from pure even though they did send
me a box once but I didn't really care
for the products that I tried so I
haven't pushed working with pure because
I just haven't really liked a lot of
their stuff
I haven't been digging it and they don't
seem to be digging on me so it's like
whatever
Lexi says I've heard conflicting but
this is not what this video is about I
apologize I very quickly things about
Too Faced I've never I've met some
people that work for Too Faced that have
been very nice but I've never met
anybody in like higher-ups of two-faced
so I can't really speak to that they've
never sent me an EP or anything they do
send my friend Erica over at Beauty in
the vlog by the way we are so off topic
and
apologize but beauty in the vlog is a
podcast my friend Erica runs for beauty
creators we just did another interview
was a couple days ago so look out in the
beginning of January for an interview
with me and Erica on beauty and the
beauty in the vlog podcast it's really
really good I think it came out great
Erica and I now were first interviewed
me we weren't friends now we're friends
and now I feel like we were just flow in
the whole time it was amazing okay so
back to the actual topic I'm gonna put a
timestamp in the video description so
now where we at 1549 when I actually go
back on topic oh my gosh I'm so sorry it
is if you were watching on the replay
I'm very sorry okay does the only time I
get to talk to you guys though I love
you guys Yolanda wanna know the
foundation I mentioned in the beginning
it's the elf moisturizing foundation
stick it is so fab so fab I love it okay
we talked about the photo bomb and
talked about the shadow shields so let's
talk about this okay this is the Besame
brightening vanilla powder in
translucent this seriously was my Holy
Grail loose powder before I got the the
one from Laura Mercier that was sent to
me from from Influenster I think I got
the Laura Mercier one but I know I
didn't pay for it this I paid for this
smells like vanilla it smells so good oh
my gosh it just smells it smells amazing
like to put on your face like in the
morning I love scents I'm a very sensory
person either I love something because
of the senses or I hate it because don't
like the way it feels but this feels
really good it's very finely milled you
don't it's a very small container so I
mean it's it's that's gonna be there
good it we're bad let me see I don't
know it's a point to one ounces which
seems like it's pretty small for a
translucent powder but I really like
this stuff it comes with the powder
puffs in here and also it's got a little
cap here to keep the powder in and I
really love this stuff but I forget to
use it I was using it all the time for a
while and then I just kind of forgot
about it once I got the once I got the
the Laura Mercier one I had been using
the bare minerals one which I really
like I really like them all kind of
evenly the bare minerals one the Laura
Mercier setting powder this one and
the two-faced peach perfect one and
those are kind of my favorites right now
but this is the best ma is the name of
the brand if you've never heard of it
it's BES AM II it's like be same the way
that it's spelled sarah says that the
elf foundation is discontinued see
that's what I thought this is what
happened with elf foundation is that
they they stopped selling it and then it
kept popping up and then they stopped
selling it and it kept popping up and
they kept I mean it was like going back
and forth for a while so I wouldn't put
it past them to bring it back again if
you don't see it right now Anna says Jen
can you please recommend a foundation
powder for dry skin the best place to
ask questions about specific needs is
our Facebook group our Facebook group is
facebook.com slash group slash whatsapp
and makeup because I have normal skin I
and I'm not a cosmetologist or a
dermatologist or anything like that
I don't feel comfortable recommending
recommending things for specific skin
types I don't feel like that's my
expertise but there are lots of people
over there that probably have your skin
type and I bet you within a few hours
you'll have tons of comments about that
particular thing that you are looking
for because there's about 27,000 people
over there at this point and everybody
screamed so it's not like we've just let
everybody in
we're very specific about who we let in
as far as we don't let people in that
don't look like they're interested in
makeup in any way
Oh Lynne says she loves the group oh I'm
so glad yet people are so helpful and so
nice we do have a lot of rules over
there so make sure you read the rules if
you join just mostly just be nice don't
get Butthead that's the major rule don't
be a Butthead if somebody's being a but
had reported to the admins and will take
care of it oh they'll take care of it I
think I've got piece of glitter on my
eye that's why I keep wiping my eye I
don't know all right let's move on so
next thing we'll talk about blush this
is the cargo swimmable swim bubbles
blush in los cabos oh my gosh these
blushes are so good
carbo is a brand where pretty much
everything I've ever tried from them has
been terrible like there is an eyeshadow
palette that I really liked it's like a
4 5 pan eyeshadow palette so can you
draw a pouch I ship out that I got a
long time ago that I love and I love
these blushes everything else I've hated
I've gotten a couple more eyeshadow
palette from them they were terrible I
don't know what is going on with cargo
but the quality has just been awful but
these
those are really really good let me
swatch this for you it is one of those
that builds really nicely so you can see
there's hardly any color there right but
then if I go again I don't know if you
can see the difference I know I went
fast
I'll try not to go so fast I have
trouble showing you guys things on
camera cuz there's a delay
I felt so bad in my Too Faced video that
two faced and the Tarte video that you
guys couldn't see the swatches I felt
awful but these are amazing the lasting
powers fantastic and they're very
buildable hopefully you could tell the
difference between the building I know I
could tell it here but everything I'm
seriously everything else
I don't like from cargo but I really
like these someone asked the name of the
group again it is called what's up in
makeup so I seriously have got to get
this thing off my eyeball if you search
for what's it been makeup in the groups
you should find it or you can go to
facebook.com slash group slash what's
been makeup alright moving on to another
cheek product that I really liked I got
this last year this is from Mac this is
the Nutcracker sweet sweet peach face
compact and this is two two and at dusk
and I love this
I used it like three times and then I
forgot to use it it's so pretty
it's so so pretty I wanted to get the
one that had whisper if guilt in it but
it was sold out this blush this one is
really super subtle so if you don't have
very fair skin this one wouldn't have
worked I know this is like way gone
because it's from last year but the
highlight in this is so incredibly
pretty
Nancy says is the blush waterproof it's
supposed to be I don't know if it
actually is I've never tested it for
being waterproof but but yeah I mean
it's it's supposed to be but this is
really really good I want I said who was
somebody said something about Oh Julie
said oh wait somebody had said it I lost
it was Oh Taylor says what advice do you
have for a first-time what's it been
makeup member if you were on the
Facebook group just read the rules I
know they're long I know there's a lot
there but please read the rules because
people don't read the rules all the time
because they see all of them they're
like our riddle rules and then they
break a rule and then they wonder why
people are the admins are like dude you
just broke a rule and they're like
wait what I broke a rule it's like
please don't read them that would be my
biggest advice just be nice to people
if somebody's mean just report it to the
admins don't don't yell don't clap back
because it just makes it 10 times worse
and then we have people saying the group
is a negative place and bla bla bla it's
annoying Katie says I have whisper of
guilt and I wanted this one too I didn't
get the whisper of guilt Wannsee we
wanted the opposite ones alright let's
move on a little bit this is one that
keeps getting lost in my drawer I keep
looking for this and wanting to use it
and that keeps getting lost this was
sent to me by benefit let me make sure
yep I bought all the rest of that stuff
this was sent to me by benefit this is
their highbrow creamy brow highlighting
pencil this is the best brow hylene
pencil I have ever used this is the only
one I've ever used that I really really
like it does have a very strong wood
smell though just so you know
it smells like wood but it works really
well a lot of the brow pen and brow
highlighting crayon things that I've
used are very patchy like you have to
really blend them in order to get them
to look smooth on your skin not this one
this one is absolutely beautiful it does
have a pink undertone just so you know
and then I'll kind of blend it out a
little bit I don't know if you'll be
able to see it hopefully you'll be able
to see it but it's very subtle on my
skin tone but if you're a little deeper
than me I bet this would be absolutely
beautiful it's so so so pretty and it
just oh it's beautiful and I keep
forgetting to use it and it's amazing
and I love it and I just forget but it's
so good it's so good okay um let's see
whatever we want to go okay let's go
brow since we're going brows okay let me
make sure I'm not missing anything
GG oh it's nice GG she says saying hi I
love you guys have a super holiday you
too
alright sorry okay so this is the brow
pal by the balm I've probably had this
for four years something like that it's
a shelf life 12 months ain't nothing
wrong with it to me doesn't smell weird
I'm still gonna use it oh look I just
looked at my face going I was reading
comments
but yeah this stuff is really really
good and I forget to use it all the time
if you want like let's say if you're on
a budget and you're looking for a brow
product stay away from those roll up
pencils the roll up you don't talk about
the roll up crime and the spoiling of
that stay away from those those are a
terrible value this is a great option
not necessarily this one but brow
powders in general are the best way to
get the most bang for your buck on a
brow product because this last first
thing can ever
I always using this every day for like
two years you can see how much I used of
it like nothing nothing I mean you
certainly have it because you don't have
to use a whole lot of it and it works
great this is in the shade dark brown I
don't know how many shades they have but
I know they have quite a few shades of
this it's I'm pretty sure they do and
it's a fantastic brow product it sinks
right down to the to the skin some brow
products will kind of sit on top of the
hair is and look really weird this does
not do that it's really really nice and
I love it it's very good but again I
forget to use it I actually like this
one better than the Anastasio brow
product the brow powder I like it better
Taylor says how do I make it look like
real hair on my brows with this you just
have to use a very very thin brow brush
that's what I do because I have these
big spaces like you can see in my
eyebrows and I just try to go like this
with you know with the brush but you
have to use a very very very thin brow
brush you're not gonna be able to get
that the Instagram look where they make
it look like hairs you're not gonna be
able get that with a brow powder this is
gonna be more for like filling in rather
than making like individual hairs I've
heard some people of wetting the brush
but I've never tried that personally so
I can't kind of vouch for that but that
might be an option to kind of turn it
into a more of a creamy product by
wetting the brush and dipping it in or
dipping it in and then wetting the brush
is probably a better idea
Jenny says it's on HauteLook fairly
regularly - yes that's true but yeah
this is a great product I really like it
a lot okay let's go - okay this is
something that I'm actually almost out
of but I really like this app it's
probably dead at this point this is the
tarte tardes clay paint liner and i kept
forgetting to use this you can see i've
used a lot of it though and wait the way
that it works is it came with a brush it
was a great brush I don't even know
where it
but it's got this little Bowl here and
what you do is you squeeze out the
product which this is probably all
jammed up because it's old but you
squeeze the product out and you take the
brush and you dip it into the bowl and
you kind of like brush your brush to get
the excess off and then you use it as
eyeliner this was a fantastic eyeliner
it was very very black very easy to use
very smudge proof really really nice and
I love this a lot I mean it's it's
really good and I forgot to use it and
now it's kind of dried out at this point
but it was good it was good
Steph said to Tarte ever respond to your
emails and now they saw I mean responded
my emails about the Amazonian clay I did
get some good responses from the
community though about I had asked a few
chats ago I mentioned that I was
emailing Tarte to find out about the
Amazonian clay and finding out what's
the deal with the Amazonian clay because
it looks like you only have Kalyn in
your products and I don't know you went
on Google Amazonian clay your products
are the only things that come up
I don't think Amazonian clay is real I
think that it's possible they get their
can their Kalyn from the Amazon I don't
know if it has more minerals there's
something in it because it's from the
Amazon I don't know if they actually do
or if it's just Kalyn but you just get
from whatever lab but I'm inclined to
believe that K land is not magical but
maybe it is maybe their Kalyn from the
Amazon is magical but that's all there
is in it and there's Kalyn and like a
lot of products so I don't know I think
it might just be marketing though but
they know they never responded to me
never responded Judith says have you
tried that eyeliner and other colors no
I haven't have you tried it in other
colors because I it's kind of pricey so
I don't know if I would buy more of them
but it was good Jenny says it's not a
thing rachel says it's a conspiracy
mm-hmm probably
okay I shadow let's go into eye shadow
labs because I love eye shadow it's my
favorite okay these are the makeup geek
these are the holographic eyeshadows
holographic no iridescent oh no I forgot
what they were called I can't I can't
remember where they were called but
these are gorgeous
the
packaging on these things are terrible
this was the original packaging I think
she's changed the packaging since then
this is in the shade chameleon weight
sliced watch these for you the packaging
is this glass packaging and well it's
like plastic e and the top does not fit
on correctly the top is beautiful but it
doesn't fit on correctly and the glue it
cracks so I actually had one completely
break and I had to find another
container for it
Packaging was terrible and that's why I
don't open these is because I'm so
scared that I'm going to wreck the
container but I want to squash these for
you because they are in a sane hey Shan
I love eyeshadow to see a girlfriend we
have that in common
oh my gosh these things are so beautiful
they have a dual chrome they're all
maybe they're just called dual Chrome's
probably the probably is called dual
Chrome's I think that's what they're
called hello not confirmed oh no they're
not hollow I don't know why so hollow
and I want to get my towel here it's
right here
OOP oh I'm dropping Thanks dropping a
lip product okay so actually I'll hold
them all up once I get them but but yeah
that's why I don't reach for these is
because of the packaging and I did up
this one's broken
look at this it's done man cuz once this
happens it's done and that's the second
one that's happened me too and adjust
this just happened tire man I'm so mad
I'm gonna have to figure something out
at the end of this video such a bummer
and it's like not coming off on my skin
the way it normally does one minute I
have to look and see what the shade is
but it's definitely not
it seems more powdery than it used to be
like it's drying out I think it is I
think it must be drying out to an extent
look see how it's crumbling it's like
super crumbly but look at my finger in
that cool looking super cool see if I
can kind of disaster control here oh my
gosh okay that's called hologram and
then I have one more sitting here that
I'll show you this one's called mood
ring but I never ever reach for these
because I'm scared I'm going to break
them like I just broke that one
but they're so pretty I think that one's
dried out though like it's not the right
formula it's not the right consistency
so anyway there you go
Herron says call Marlena and tell her
your tale of woe I've talked I've talked
to makeup geek about it not more Elena
but I've talked to their customer
service and they're basically like they
weren't gonna do anything about it
we aren't they pretty how old are these
shadows probably two years old I got him
when they first came out what is that
probably bout two years old what I would
imagine but yeah they're so pretty can
you see him in this spot I don't think
you can see them let me see if I can
pull him back here is that better for
the swatches I hope you can see them I
feel like the light's not shining on
them right so yeah Rachel says I just
need makeup to be pressed report I hate
loose powders and pigments I always
spill them yeah that's where I'm at
right now
I need to make sure I don't spill this
pigment everywhere because this is this
is not cool that was a little better
the last watches that I did a little bit
better oh yeah because there's no way
this is going back together that's
disappointing okay but anyway that's why
I don't use these but they're amazing
the formula was amazing when I bought
them and now they're not I might just
have to throw it away because that one
just doesn't seem right anymore just
angle up to the light okay let me see if
I can get it can you see that it's so
hard cuz it's a 30 minute 30 minute 30
second delay hopefully you can see that
okay I got to move on from that though
because it's making me too sad okay
colour-pop low-key palettes this I think
I got in PR nobody PR I think I got this
at generation Beauty it's still not my
swatches still stink it's still not
showing the one oh my gosh I'm terrible
with this apparently Gina says I don't
have any mug products marlenas a friend
of a friend and I just won't don't want
to go there for some reason gotcha
I met Marlena once she was very nice
when I met her but anyway this color pop
eyeshadow palette it was good was it
great no but it was good I enjoyed using
it I thought it was nice and I never use
it I don't know why cuz it's very
I should totally do it oh here we go a a
Saints a saint a st says can't use
alcohol and creative pressed item
possibly that's a pretty smart idea
that's why I like live chat Ellie up
from grace is here hello hello Tim how
are you yeah Steph says their formula
got way better well that's good to know
I haven't bought anything from them in a
while I don't know why they seems to
have fallen off of social media I guess
they're just not sending out as much PR
I don't know Kayla says I think your
swatches are fine oh no I don't think
that was very good that reminded me of
the terrible swatches I did in this in a
two-faced video I felt so bad watching
that in the replay all right here's one
that you may not have heard of this is
serenity and Scott it's an indie brands
and they did a collaboration with a
youtuber named Samantha Riley Samantha
Riley is very good friends with coffee
break with Danny that's where you may
have seen her before or you may be
subscribe to her Channel I know I am
subscribed to her channel she doesn't
put up a lot of content lately but I do
really like her I've met her multiple
times at different events she's very
nice I had her sign my palette for me
see that
I had sniff assignment out for me which
I thought was very fun his pants really
really good the price point on this is
stupid I don't know how much it is but
it was ridiculous it was like $50 or
something like that for this eyeshadow
palette which is insane because like the
eyeshadow pans are not huge they like
remind me of like the Coastal Scents I
think it might be smaller than the
Coastal Scents hotpots like they're not
big at all it doesn't have a I think
it's had an outer packaging because it
doesn't have like a like a size on it
but the price on these was ridiculous
but these shadows are really pretty let
me see if I can do better on my swatches
here and I love this I remember when I
was at when I bought this I was with
Cassie from thrift thick at IMATS and
she bought one too and she loved it she
put it in her favorites said I can just
how's that yeah it was it's stupid like
I don't even I don't know how expensive
it was I should know I paid I remember
buying it and be like okay I'm buying
this to support Samantha Samantha Riley
is her name not Samantha March but yeah
so I was like I said I'm buying it
support her
I kind of suck it up hmm but they're
really good I mean they're very nice
shadows really nice longevity and just a
great palette it's just the price point
was outrageous I felt like on that but
it was worth it because I got to support
Samantha I'm really big on supporting
youtubers and their ventures I know like
I was watching Stefanie Nicole's video
she'd that long getting ready with me
chitchat and she was talking about how
you know like buying merch and stuff
like that what did she say about it like
that it was she put an analogy and it
was very funny I can't remember what her
analogy was and I don't want to butcher
it but she was basically like kind of
you know I kind of bar with merch I love
buying merch like I bought I bought a
necklace from Mallory Maui Cornelia sent
cornelian s'en chameleons and I forgot
how Sarah last name but I'll put her
channel down below after the videos over
I bought a necklace from her from her
necklace brand from her jewelry brand I
bought a shirt from that Taylor I bought
a shirt from Laura Lee what else I
bought the serenity and Scott palette I
buy I like to support people I like to
buy merch and I like to buy you know
eyeshadow collaboration things from
people that I like so you know oh here
we go show this Naomi says here goes she
said you know Stephanie said she was
gonna put out she might put out a shirt
that says no one wants your merch Pam
which I thought was hilarious I would
buy that shirt that shirt would be mine
if Stephanie came out on that shirt I
would buy it no doubt about it no doubt
[Laughter]
alright next one I haven't used very
much recently is the pastel goth palette
by Kat Von D I love this palette this is
a fantastic eyeshadow palette and I
never use it
I guess maybe in the spring because
right now it's a little loud for like
fall in winter but it's so pretty it's
so pretty I love this eyeshadow palette
and the formula is fantastic I really
enjoyed this I think I did a full review
on this I'm pretty sure but I love this
okay this is one that Stephanie actually
talked about in her video Oh Mallory's
two seven one two thank you for the
numbers I appreciate that
H vanity for the numbers two seven ones
who she's gorgeous gorgeous like epitome
epitome of gorgeous Mallory is like I
can't even handle her she's way too
pretty
all right melt stack stephanie was
talking about the big pallet that you
can put the melts and now which i think
is fantastic and would make me use these
more but these are stupid expensive and
then you get a lot of product but
they're so good they're really good I
forgot which stack this is but this is
there's dark matter which is this one
and nigma and unseen and blur where the
what are the ones that I have these if
you only melt eyeshadows that I own I
think my friend Nancy yes my friend
Anson bought these for me they're
fantastic they're wonderful but I never
reach for them because they always get
shoved in a drawer somewhere and I
forget about them because you can't you
can't do anything with them individually
it's like it's not like there's a top
where I can like set them up somewhere
so that I remember like you have to keep
them together with with this with the
mirror thing or else they get ruined
like it's just that I mean they're cool
packaging but they're just they get lost
so I forgot to use them
Stephanie talked about that in her video
- it is very bulky Christina absolutely
Mon 420 love beauty Jenn quickly what do
you think of items being sold out and
youtubers always having them to review
we actually thought about putting this
in a top news this week for what's the
makeup okay this is its own marketing
okay so like for example
people gave lauralee so much crap for
her palette not selling out she could
have easily had that palette sell out
easily easily all she had to do was set
the threshold and like 5000 pallets sold
out she could have easily done that and
been like success Laura Lee sells out
and the media would have gone crazy and
drama channels wouldn't had anything to
say girlfriend put out the amount of
palette she had she didn't cheat about
it it's a marketing technique you put
out what you think the people will buy
you put on the on the website what you
think the people will buy and then you
sell it out and then you keep the rest
it's all height buts on marketing you
know if it sells out it's a highly
coveted Buhl thing it's not real it's
marketing it's not really selling out I
mean yes probably some things are really
selling
occasionally but a lot of these things
it's all marketing it's not real so just
so you know I don't think it's not real
don't fall for it
we're smarter than that we're not gonna
fall for it that may be so mad when
people were so harsh on Laura about that
and people gonna be harsh on the word
about what they want to be harsh on her
about but that one that one I felt like
was completely unjustified because she
could have totally faked that if she
wanted to but she was being honest about
it which I thought was supercool but she
was honest about it cat's pajamas kind
of boring totally feel that I can
totally see that but she could but she
could have she could have made that
palette sell out easy easy she's had a
Flicka button Nicolas Lucia says it's to
encourage impulse shopping if you think
it might sell it soon you'll spend less
time thinking about yeah it's like you
know it's the whole you know we've been
in the article that I read and they were
talking about you know that that caveman
instinct of you know knowing something
is gonna be gone in a final tool right
now it's gonna be gone and I have to get
it right now or else it's gonna be gone
forever I get to that it's that mindset
you know colour-pop uses it the
reference colour-pop they reference
Kylie cosmetics in it you know that it's
this this in this animalistic thing you
know it's not real it's marketing don't
fall for it so tam says it bothers me
when people say the palette is boring it
that part doesn't bother me because
people I can get that I see that I see
that but it really was good quality I'm
being honest I like that palette I did
and even if I never met her in my entire
life I would still like that palette
even if she didn't never sent to me I
would still like it what I about it
no like I said in the video I wouldn't
have bought it because I already have
all those colors but quality is
fantastic
it's very good she did a great job on
the formula truly lovely says I really
like my Laura Lee palette and I'm a
basic makeup girl yeah there you go see
me - yeah I mean it's a good palette and
I think it was smart of her to do a more
neutral palette when she first started
coming out with stuff instead of
something crazy Christina says I think
her palette is predictable and totally
her sure I get that - I'm with you I'm
with you on that following you all right
speaking of a palette that is
not predictable this is by lunatick
cosmetic labs let's get back into the
topic because I'm off topic again this
palette is so good it's really good and
it's so cute it's got like this little
Ouija board like format here and the
shades are all these like cool tone
purples
well not all Kalu tone but because this
one's a little bit warmer but they're
really cool this makes a beautiful eye
look this reminds me a lot of the mob's
palette by dose of colors but a little
bit more edgy and you've got this really
light shade that I really like this
light shade is beautiful a lot of light
shades I have a lot of trouble with
because they don't come off opaque but
this one is gorgeous and the finger
swatch is very representative rippers
yeah representative of what you'll see
on the eye it's really good like Oh a
lot of times a chaise like this or
chalky and powdery and don't work very
well this one is money it's really good
and I just love the packaging I think
it's adorable
I think the ANSI brought gave this to
one to me to Nancy's my angel by the way
if you've never have never heard me talk
about Nancy my angel so Nancy bought me
this and she bought me the melt stack
but I think everything else on here I
either bought or I got in PR not too
much PR a lot of stuff I bought myself
alright I think we're done with eye
shadow yes we're done with eye shadow
let's move on to lips Tiffany says first
time I wanted your livestreams so great
oh I'm so glad you're enjoying it people
either really like the livestreams or
they hate them look I just wipe it off
my hand and it's still there let me take
labs I'm telling you it's a hidden gem
in indie makeup
I don't ever hardly hear people talk
about lunatic labs they're super fat
they're contour palette is super fab -
so good
Shana says love lunatic I know right
exactly that's what I'm saying Joanne
says how much does that limited palette
Kimberly Clark is using them I have no
idea yeah I know yay Nancy I'm with you
sam says okay Nancy must be millionaire
I don't know I've never asked her I've
never asked her but she's my angel and I
adore her she's fabulous okay another
thing I got for PR these are lipsticks
these are artist Rouge matte lipsticks
by make up forever I own very little for
makeup forever the price point is out of
my price point like it's it's expensive
so I don't buy a lot from them but
I did get these at makeup events I got
the shade this one is m500 these
lipsticks are really really good and I
forget to use them all the time they're
beautiful this one is just like a deep
beautiful berry shade they're very
hydrating and pretty and wonderful
really enjoy them we say they smell yeah
they all smell great they don't smell
terrible but they're good
okay tea sets $34 for the unit lunatic
labs which i think is fair I think it's
a good price for what you get and then
this one is c21 one and this one's more
of like a me shade and I always forget
to use these oh so pretty
so pretty I love these things
I absolutely love these things Christina
says we appreciate you Nancy yeah I know
me too and because Nancy because of
Nancy you guys get to see more stuff too
so they're just really good and you can
see they're like staining my hand a
little bit which is really good because
then they end up you know kind of
wearing on the lips better at least for
me they wear very very nicely Susan says
I love makeup forever but they're
expensive yup totally agree and that's
why I don't buy anything from them but
would you really like these because I
didn't pay for them
would I buy more probably not because I
don't like to pay that much for a
lipstick that's just me personally one
of these fell I'm not gonna reach for it
but these these I would pay for these I
love these are the julep
what are these technically called matte
lip mousse and this is Annie this one's
in the shade bee suit this is my
favorite oh my gosh it's so pretty look
at this cool wands so pretty so pretty
it works really really well it's got
this little ball tip so it makes it
really easy to get up into the Cupid's
bow I just realize my hair looks like
complete doo doo I can't even I can't
even with my hair it's so thin it looks
like I didn't even wash it and I totally
did not today but yesterday yesterday
day before yesterday yeah I didn't wash
it ever mind there's a reason why it
looks like this now off of my showering
habits and onto this yes this is a very
moosie formula it doesn't dry down
completely
it is beautiful very opaque very very
comfortable really love these they
remind me a lot of the bareMinerals Gen
nudes that I really really like but they
are they smell so good they smell like
like the like hot chocolate hot
chocolate no chocolate pudding there's a
difference
chocolate pudding just like the gen news
they're also very similar to D nu M
Cosmetics liquid lipsticks but they're
just they're really beautiful and really
comfortable and I love them
Nancy says stop you look great you all
what you would say that even if I had
hair sticking out of my nose you would
say that no you would tell me if I had
hair sticking out of my nose I knew that
yes the julep lippies are these are
amazing these are really really good I
definitely recommend these I would have
purchased many of these I have another
one down here let me get it oh my gosh
okay
let me get this one okay this is my
second favorite this is B Sue's my
favorite this is Lala I love this one
too it's just it's kind of the same kind
of thing but it's just a little bit
lighter but they have so many shades of
these so this one's a little bit more
cool toned a little lighter it smells so
good
Ivy says julep only selling their own
website or somewhere else they also sell
it alta their their own Altos website I
don't know if they're these are in Ulta
in store but I know they're on the
website I think some stores have jollof
maybe some don't I don't know but um but
yeah I think that's it no wait nope
there's one more thing okay this is I
have a bone to pick with this product
though this is the last one this is the
elf what is this this is the what do
they call it
it's the exfoliating stick or whatever
this one's in the one cherry tart
they've reformulated this and I don't
like it anymore
it's the grains are not big enough
anymore they used to be like really
gritty or you rub it on and it
exfoliates your lips and it's amazing Oh
Stella says juleps on QVC as well you're
absolutely right thank you
so it's like supposed to exfoliate that
your lips I don't feel like it does it
as well as it used to
mmm actually I feels really good now but
I like the chunkies better in the old
formula but it's still nice and I wish I
used it more because I do like it I
don't know if you can see like the grid
on there hopefully you can see it and it
tastes good tastes like cherries
and plastic that's the truth
cherries in plastic so it tastes like
and I feels good it feels hydrating and
oily and then I wipe it off and my lips
are good but I always forget to use it
Christina wants to know if I'm using or
during the beauty lish box ok this is
the thing about the beauty lush Luffy
box it's coming out I think it comes out
was it New Year's Eve that comes out I
forget I forgot to watch um my friends
video she just put a video out on it her
name is going out of my head right the
second Trish Trish what's Trish's
channel called I can't remember
well I can't wear what Trish's channels
called now I have to look it up oh I had
it in front of me I would totally know
but anyway my friend trash put out but
she works for beauty lush or she had had
in the past it's a it she put out a
video about that it's coming out but
anyway it's a mystery box it's like Oh
Steph says 12:26 1226 so it's a mystery
box
I'm losing it and it's like 80 bucks or
something like that with shipping and
you get mystery you dealer stuff and you
can get a lucky box where you get even
more stuff in it it's like Natasha - no
no stuff and stuff like that and it's
really good it's a well no it's not
really good I shouldn't say that it's a
really good opportunity to try things
from Beauty Leche that you wouldn't have
tried before a glittery life thank you
guys so much
see you guys know Trish a glittery life
Elyse knows and jess knows and Michelle
knows thank you so much for that and
Jenny knows I'm glad you guys said I
don't know why I couldn't think of a
name or a channel name oh my gosh okay
let me tell you something okay let me
finish the beauty leash and then I'll
tell you about Trish and why I'm mad at
Too Faced for Trish okay so anyway every
time I got this box and this would be my
fourth box every time I get it I'm
disappointed every time
never fails I always open the box with
my kids it's like a super raw as soon as
I get the box I bring it in wherever I'm
filming and me and the kids we open it
up together like a present and every
time I'm disappointed every single year
so I think I might try it one more year
just do it one more time because it is a
fun video to do and it's a fun thing to
get and I do get things a lot of times
that I
like at the first box I really liked
like I got to try the indie Lee toner
which I loved
stuff like that it exposes me to new
products but like last year I don't
think there was a single thing in there
that I actually genuinely liked like at
all
$75 aspen says she got the Wayne Goss
brush abh Modern Renaissance and lots
more totally worth the money see
that's I don't get boxes like that I get
boxes with you know the Atelier
eyeshadow palette in it which was all
neutrals great quality I mean great but
it's like I'm never going to use that
thing you know like I don't know I
always get stuff I'd never use I think I
might just have too much makeup it's
called the Beauty lish lucky bag but
it's a box so anyway let me tell you why
I'm mad at Too Faced for Trish so I was
watching two faiths Instagram stories
and there's Trish with J Casa and
they're like Thank You J kissa for
stopping by did they tag Trish no they
did not act Trish they add a J kissa of
course but why couldn't they add Trish
how hard is it at Trish so people can
follow Trish if they want to at a
glittery life it's not that hard it made
me so mad made me feel like they're very
elitist they didn't tag her it upset me
Abby says didn't you get and just get a
haka hoto brush Aussie oh yeah and it
was crap it was terrible that was a
terrible brush that was not a good one
it was like one that didn't even say
haka hodo on it I think was Chicka hoto
I don't know one of those photos I
forget which one but yeah it didn't even
say it's a blush brush on it it was like
one I think they were just trying to get
rid of it nobody was buying because I
don't care if it was made in Japan my
hand that thing did not work it was not
a good brush it was like super fluffy
and I couldn't figure out how to get it
to work a bit well like not even close
to his gut look I have some motor
brushes I like better than that one I
think was stupid that was my opinion
anyway I couldn't get it to work
Leslie said oh I got an email about the
lucky bag declined yeah Allison says Too
Faced is having some real leadership
issues I think Too Faced she's just so
high up there they don't care they're
gonna sell product even and they're
gonna sell product it doesn't matter
like they could be the biggest butt
heads on the planet they're still gonna
sell product because their stuffs cute
because they're MCed
they're marketing geniuses alright I'm
almost okay Jared diet
hi Jared aiyah how are you they are
elitist you only matter if you have a s
ton of followers yeah yeah probably yeah
I don't know they sent my friend Erica
PR but I don't sound me peon but that's
okay I don't care they don't have to
send me PR I'll get it anyway
things that I'm interested in anyway
Melissa says that goes back to major
influences need a shout-out small
channels to turn around the community
yeah I mentioned something like that
about we got 7 minutes left and I'm done
so I'm just gonna be off topic from the
rest of the video so if you were
watching to see the things I hadn't used
that part of the video is done so thank
you so much for being here I'm just
gonna go off at the mouth for a bit so
if you want to hang out for me going off
at the mouth then feel free to hang out
but that part of video was gonna be done
so anyway what was I talking about I was
talking about
oh so Twitter so candy Johnson who I
absolutely adore I met her once she gave
me like 4 hugs
she's like the nicest person she's so
nice so nice so she tweeted something
about how to make up community and so
this and so that like blah blah it's so
negative and it's like dude dude look
I'm tired of it I'm tired what Manny
does it to where they go on and they're
like oh they're gonna do so terrible
it's like there's like thousands of
makeup chills thousands ok I've been to
what 7 generation beauties at this point
like so many I go to lick all of them
I'm not going I'm probably not gonna go
to LA though the one that's coming up
I'm probably not gonna go because I'm
just I'm kind of done with it at this
point for right now at least I'll
probably I'll stick to going to New York
but I don't know if I'm gonna go out to
the West Coast ones or not but anyway
I've met so many influencers of so many
different sizes people from like you
know like you know 200 brand new
channels you know brand 50 subscribers
all the way up to people with you know
500 600 thousand scrim people are so
nice overall like people that I've met
are very nice maybe there's just people
that I haven't met because they're just
not nice people but the people that I've
met are super nice very kind awesome
people and like the big creators are
always complaining about how people are
so terrible
it's like um maybe you should expand
your circle a little bit maybe
stop hanging out with people that are
butt heads maybe when you go to these
events maybe bring somebody maybe brings
maybe get to know some other people in
the community and bring somebody it's
nice
bring nice people in and it's not about
me it's about in general like my friend
Julia for example Julia salvia
incredibly talented tutorials so good so
good she just did the collaboration with
pur Lisse when the news that was if you
saw what some make up and curlies she's
so good she's so talented like oh she
does like 400 views sometimes on a video
she spends like hours an hour and she's
so good there's no reason I mean she's
got a bigger Instagram following that
she does on YouTube but I just don't get
it I don't get it there's no reason why
she shouldn't have hundreds of thousands
of subscribers but she's beautiful and
she's in she's sick talented and she's
sick creative I don't get it you know
what I mean and it's just because the
algorithm pushes people down like me you
you have to break through this ceiling
and the only way to break through the
ceiling is like like for example like
going out to collaborate with Stephanie
Nicole like that helps me break through
the ceiling did I break through no I
still didn't break through the ceiling
even after clamoring with Stephanie
Nicole like it's really hard to get
people to see your videos and this is
the thing like it's only for me it's
only about getting your videos in front
of people you know because like for
example like when I went out
collaborated with Stephanie I didn't
know how many how many subscribers I was
gonna get it wasn't about that
it was about doing something fun I love
traveling I love going and meeting
people I would say I've been looking up
to Stephanie for so long like the fact
that I get to go meet her and hang out
with her and film with her that was what
it was about it wasn't about getting
subscribers of course I knew I was gonna
gain some subscribers off of it I didn't
know how many that wasn't what it was
about but what was my point because I
get off on these tangents of things I
know people are going to say what was my
point
oh so oh as far as breaking through the
ceiling of things um you know when I got
all those subscribers I still have the
same percentage of people watching so
when on YouTube you're looking for 8 to
12 percent of your whole subscriber
viewership watching so even if I gain
even after I gained all those
subscribers from Stephanie I still have
that 8 to 12 percent viewer ratios
I know that people from Stephanie are
still watching my videos which is ideal
if you collaborate with someone you get
a bunch of subscribers and nobody
watches it doesn't matter because it's
not about subscribers it's about views
so so my point is is that you know even
though I still get a great ratio of use
to my videos my videos still aren't
being shown to any viewers and I feel
like if more people saw my videos that
more people would watch and they'd be
happy you know what I mean but there are
so many challengers there's literally
hundreds of channels out there that
probably are in the exact same situation
as me if not they are so much more
talented than me and have such better
channels than me and if they're not
getting the attention like it's not just
me it's there's so many of them so I
feel like these bigger influencers have
an opportunity in ten seconds to change
someone's life absolutely change their
life just by saying hey I watch this
channel doesn't matter Betty Sue's
Channel i watch Betty Sue's channel it
was amazing I think you guys should go
check out Betty Sue that's it that's all
it takes and now Betty Sue has all these
people that are your subscribers now
going over and enjoying Betty Sue's
channel and they're happy because now
they get to watch Betty Sue I hear all
the time from Stephanie subscribers oh
my gosh I'm so glad that Stephanie show
me your channel because I love it Betty
Sue has no reason not to have viewers
you know what I mean that's just the way
that I feel I don't know I went off on a
big tangent on that one but that's just
the way that I feel I'm gonna go up and
read a couple of the comments Steph says
this is the staff s tes that I found you
from Steph two weeks ago yeah I'm so
glad Lucinda says that cloud was stuff
was amazing thank you listen I'm one of
my faves I've been friends with not
friends but I guess friends I'll call us
friends Lucinda because if I need
anything I know I could I could I could
talk to you Lucinda I love Lucinda she's
amazing she's my friend in Barbados I
could have met Lucinda once and I missed
her at IMATS I was very sad we missed
each other cuz she lives in Barbados and
I could have met her and that makes me
sad and get to give her a hug rachel
says I also found you through Stephanie
Nicole Sarah Anne says that makes sense
Angela says you did pick up a lot of
subscribers after Stephanie continued
doing as many clouds as possible yeah
I mean and again it's not about that
it's about you know I want people to
enjoy my videos and if people are gonna
enjoy my videos I would love for them to
at least have the opportunity to see who
I am and decide yes or no whether they
want to subscribe but YouTube doesn't
allow that they push the big numbers
people YouTube doesn't really help and
people don't want to subscribe I'm
totally cool with that please don't
subscribe if you don't like my content I
don't want just subscribers floating
around they don't watch that's stupid
daniella says I'm always on the lookout
for influencers with hooded eyes because
I have hood eyes and they're hard to
work with and hooded influencers are so
rare at least that seem that seems the
way to me go over to the Facebook group
and ask them to recommend some good
youtubers with hooded eyes because I'm
sure they have a list brooke says it's
very hard to grow it's almost impossible
unless you know the bigger people it's
very discouraging it is very
discouraging and and the thing is too
though is it can't have like I've
learned this through doing this for five
years and because I've gone through
periods of time where I've been sad
about not growing and things like that
but this is the thing is I've come to a
place where I am at peace because I know
that people that watch my videos doesn't
matter how many of them are there are
the people that watch my videos are
enjoying it and getting something from
it there's gonna be a group of people
that don't like my content and it's
totally cool but I know the people that
are watching my videos are getting
something out of it so as long as you're
helping I mean everybody's an individual
person so as long as you're helping
people does it is it really in the end
the about the number of people you're
helping no you know it's about that
you're helping people so don't get
discouraged it's YouTube is a long long
road as far as growth and growing your
channel and all that it's very long and
you really have to love what you're
doing in order to be able to stick with
it you have to love it and I'm very
thankful that I do love it and like I
mentioned last week I think was last
week some point I was like if if you if
I make no money off of youtube if
YouTube decided to stop paying creators
completely I didn't get a set of my
videos I would still be here I wouldn't
go anywhere because that's not what it's
about
I love making youtube videos I love it
it's my favorite thing it's my hobby
