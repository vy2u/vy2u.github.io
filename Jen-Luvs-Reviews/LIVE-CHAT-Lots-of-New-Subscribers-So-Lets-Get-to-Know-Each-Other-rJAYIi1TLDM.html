hit the button hello my friends welcome
to the lots of makeup chat I'm crossing
my fingers on the sound this week
because it seems like every other chat I
do the sound sounds good and then it
sounds bad and I keep doing the same
thing every single week so I don't even
know why sometimes it works and
sometimes doesn't but I'm still getting
used to the software that YouTube
YouTube makes you use an outside
software in order to do live chat so I'm
still getting used to the software
excited to change a month or so go but
anyway that's not what we're here to
talk about welcome to live chat today
we're gonna do one ask me anything I
don't think I've ever opened up a chat
for and asked me anything it's always
been like you know let's hang out or
whatever like I've never said ask me
anything like specifically so we're
gonna try to keep a family friendly as
much as possible I'm pretty good at
talking in code you know like the whole
when something isn't quite appropriate
but I can kind of like tell the adults
in secret what I'm talking about kind of
thing I'm pretty good at that so if you
guys want to ask me that kind of stuff
to you I don't care I'm seriously like
I've always been very very very open
like it's just I don't have walls and
that's part of my problem on the
internet is they have no walls but I
think that it's it's you know I like
being transparent because it's a lot
easier it's really easy being
transparent because then you have
nothing to hide and no one can ever get
anything on you because you've always
told everybody everything there's never
any tea spilled you know what I mean
so anyway yeah I thought that would just
be fun especially since I have so many
new subscribers and people that may may
not know me very well so I figured we
would just hang out and get to know each
other a little bit and then we'll get
back to like serious makeup talk next
week I meant to go crab I got I bought a
couple of things I meant to go grab but
it's nothing really that exciting so
I'll tell well let me tell you guys know
I'm a supernatural fan family show
supernatural they came out with a new
eyeshadow palette at Hot Topic
of course I had to purchase I bought one
I have it it's like right over there but
I
one and then they just came out with
another one they're really not very good
quality you can get a decent look out of
them but they're really not very good
and then I got a liquid lipstick set
that I haven't even opened yet and it's
got holographic lip gloss in it so I
figured I would try it it might actually
have little hollow flecks in it I don't
know yet but no meant to go get that and
I just remembered I forgot I went to bat
it like two o'clock in the morning so
I'm a little bit like we're like barely
awake so hopefully it works out but
before we go into the questions I want
to go ahead and say hello to the people
that are here and live chats go ahead
and scroll up a little bit and hopefully
the sound is OK oh it's like it breaks
my heart when people say you know your
sound sounds terrible and it's like no I
really don't know well if I can't hear
anything
alright so AJ is here my friend my
friend Superbowl 50 - yeah Super Bowls
today I probably won't be watching much
I'm not a big football person my family
is my family's big Redskins fans but I
grew up with the Super Bowl on all that

school I was really really big into our
high school football team like really
into my like going to games and cheering
them on and I when they lost I like we
went to the playoffs one year no we went

them confused I like them both equally
and I always get them confused I've
never seen either one a concert even
though I wouldn't love to so let's go
ahead and get into some questions Oh
Angie's taking her daughter to ballet oh
my daughter took ballet for a really
short period of time I wanted her to do
ballet but she wanted to dance her own
way and she didn't like ballet cuz she
had to listen to what the teacher wanted
her to dance and she didn't like that so
she quit because she just wanted to
dance but the teacher wanted to do
specific things she's like nope she's
only like three or four hello Gigi how
do you feel after all what honestly how
do you feel after all the positive vibes
in the community after your creators
until
Jiji you know what I this is the thing
about the eye if you don't know I
recently did a video where I shouted out
channels I spent hours looking at
channels that had under 5,000
subscribers most I think they all had
under 3,000 subscribers actually I don't
think any of them had over maybe even
twenty five hundred subscribers and I
put them in a video and you can find it
on my channel but you know I don't think
that people realize how good it feels to
help people I feel like you know some
people they're so into doing their own
thing and trying to stay out of drama
and you know just being on their
streamline of what they're doing for
themselves they don't realize how
amazing it feels to help other people
and you know I feel like I got as much
out of it which was unintended like I
didn't even realize like how like I went
into it you know knowing that I just
wanted to help people because I know how
hard it is to grow a YouTube channel
it's so singing hard I've been doing
this five years finally crossed a
hundred thousand subscribers and I've
always felt like my content has been
overall good you know I've gone through
different you know you know different
stages I've improved my lighting I've
improved my background I've improved you
know different things here and there but
overall my contents relatively the same
you know you know tweak things here in
there but I'm still me I still review
things with my same tone with my same
honesty and I feel like you know there
are so many really good channels when I
started watching these channels and
people were saying they were gonna be
demonetised and I saw how good they were
it's like what is going on that there's
all there's so many good channels out
there and they're completely hidden I
was like this is ridiculous well I guess
I'm just gonna I've always been kind of
a loudmouth so whenever I see like you
know people it's somebody called me a
social justice warrior the other day and
I know that's an insult but I believe in
helping people you know I believe that
if somebody is down you lift them up and
if that's a bad thing then I don't want
to be a good thing like I want to help
people because it's like you know it's
if we all just looked out for each other
can you imagine how awesome this world
would be
so once I did it and then I realized
like I cried like multiple times when
people were telling me oh my gosh my
subscriber numbers just doubled oh my
gosh I just got a thousand subscribers
some of these people that had under a
thousand subscribers now has have 2000
subscribers I mean it's just unreal and
that that takes years and they they gain
them in a couple of days and it wasn't
because of me this is what I was talking
about it's not because of what I did I
mean yes I put them in front of people's
eyes but if people didn't like their
content that's why I put the little
clips of their channels if people didn't
like their content then people wouldn't
go over and subscribe you know so it's
it was their clip that I showed that
brought people over it was them that
brought people over and not me I just
put them in front of people's eyes and
who taught me that and really enforced
that in me I mean I kind of knew that
but what we're really fortunate that was
Stephanie Nicole because when I got a
big wave of subscribers from Stephanie
from during the cloud with Stephanie
Nicole that's what she said to me she
was like Jen you were already awesome
all I had to do was just show them that
you existed and I wish that bigger
creators realized how good it feels to
help people and they don't think that
they realized that that I got just as
much emotionally out of it as they did I
mean I didn't get anything subscriber
wise but that doesn't matter you know
like I I got so much out of it
emotionally I was so happy and it made
me feel good so if you know if we could
just get these bigger creators to
understand that they will get something
out of it even if they don't gain
subscribers they're gonna get it it
makes you feel so good to help somebody
you know what I mean I know I've gone on
and on and on about that for a while but
you know it's just amazing how helping
someone can can really impact you and
and anybody can do it in their daily
lives I mean whether it's returning a
shopping cart for somebody or you know
letting someone with one item in your
growth in their you know in their hands
get in front of you in the grocery line
or you know I don't know like whatever
you know somebody's a dollar short at
the gas station and you give them the
dollar ain't little things like that can
make a huge difference for people and I
just I wish there was more of that in
this world I feel like we're so in it
for ourselves lately as a society so I
don't know that I went on and on and on
for
I'm sorry for how long iris Lovelace
says I found Lauren May beauty through
you oh I love her I think she's great
Christina says I've been into the urban
abandoned Explorer videos I don't know
what that means
urban abandoned Explorer videos lately
and the beauty community can learn a lot
from them they support each other and
work together and not competing at all
the urban abandoned explored videos what
is that
am I gonna fall down a rabbit hole
Christina I think I'm gonna fall down a
rabbit hole
I think somebody says what coffee cat
says Jen love Stephanie Nicole edgy and
honest and this is one thing that she
would kill me if if I you know she knows
things but she is a really nice person
you know she's got this edgy vibe this
sharp you know vibe but she's a really
nice person she's got such a good heart
you know and she doesn't get to show
that in her videos because she's
reviewing products but man is she a good
person I'm just you know putting that
out there she's probably wouldn't be
happy cuz she's gonna ruin her
reputation is what she would say Natasha
says helping somewhere being nice
doesn't mean to cost anything some
people forget that I mean like one thing
that I did I do like I always think of a
grocery store because I always feel like
that is such a like all for me place but
like helping the cashier like I bring my
reusable bags and I go to the end and I
I open up the bags the reusable bags for
the lady at the grocery store the man
that's working the counter you know my
mom's worked in grocery store since I
was in second grade so anything I can do
to help people in the grocery store I
always try to do because it's just it
can be such a thankless job you know
Emily says going back to my question how
do you take your coffee my coffee I do I
milk only no sugar and I like flavored
coffee so I'll go to Starbucks and get
like a sugary coffee every once in a
while but I try not to drink my sugar if
I can help it I'd much rather have a big
old chocolate bar then drink a sugary
drink that's just me Jacqueline says I
love your coffee mug I can't remember
where I even got this from like I've had
it for so long I can't even remember it
it says hi Jen much love from New York
City
I Love New York City you have you have
done a selfless act you're amazing
helping out small youtubers oh thank you
and but you know like I said like I got
so much out of it it was it was you know
it ended up working out that I felt so
good
afterward I would definitely do it again
if nothing else you know helping people
but it made me feel happy you know
Bridgette says what's your top advice
for a smaller youtuber top advice is get
to know your camera guys get for the
comfort level with the camera thing is
one thing when I looked at all these
channels that was the big thing that I
think stands out between people that
have channels that grow and channels
that don't is the the comfort level
because people will look at their
monitor over here and talk like this and
you lose that connection with your
audience if you're not looking at the
camera and it's hard for people to
relate to you if you're not looking at
the camera also you know getting
comfortable and speaking to the camera
like you would anybody else I mean if
I'm you know I've got my phone my pop
socket broke I'm really upset but I'm
gonna I'm gonna do it I see a lot this
is the new palette from Urban Decay it
has nine shadows in it and I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch it for you right now
and I just really like these a lot
they're really really good you know and
it's just like a like this this empty
this emptiness behind the eyes you know
and and that I think people can see and
people don't realize like how much
people can tell like even your
intonation the way that you say words
the way the light behind your eyes it's
like acting to a point where you know if
you're not in it and really they're in
present in the video people are gonna be
able to read it you know you have to be
present and there and talking to the
camera like like like it's an actual
human because there are actual humans
watching you and it's that connection I
feel like that a lot of small youtubers
are missing so that that would be my
biggest thing and it's free you know
just working on that camera presence and
I've told people before because people
asked me to like look at their channel
and give them advice and it takes me a
really long time to do that so I don't
do it all the time because it takes me a
good half an hour or like type
everything up because I
like helping people but you know even
turning the camera you know uploading a
video with no intention of uploading it
you know not uploading recording a video
with no intention of uploading it and
just practicing you know just talking to
the camera and pretending like it's a
friend I think that's a that's a big
thing so Monica loves beauty 420 hello
my friend you are very easy to watch and
listen to I hear what you're saying oh
thank you so much Lisa says I started
watching beauty videos years ago but I
found that more joy since watching the
smaller channels they're real and the
love is still there in the passion still
there absolutely absolutely I agree but
it's so hard to find them that's the
problem is it so hard to find them okay
this is what she needs you guys need to
do what Gigi's doing Gigi is adding me
at Gemma's reviews if you at me I can
see the questions better Peggy says I
really like the fashion book hot mess
mama MD function no problem i'm glad
that you like them I like them too
Shelly says I stopped watching a video
yesterday because she was watching
herself in the monitor the whole time
yeah I mean it's distracting as a viewer
Gigi says do you have an exciting birth
story for one of your kids I pulled my
hip out with Lila they gave me too much
epidural epidural swith both my kids I'd
give it to any woman that can do without
an epidural but I accidentally I I
couldn't feel my legs and I was pulling
my legs back and I said and can I hurt
myself and they said no and I hurt
myself so I sought hip problems because
of that but I wouldn't say that's really
exciting
Lila laughs what's got a cool birth
story too and that she she was born on
April 6th it would have been the 7th if
it was a leap if it wasn't a leap year
that year she was exactly seven pounds
and she was born at exactly 7 o'clock
and she was 21 inches long which is a
multiple of seven and she was conceived
on the weekend of 777 in Las Vegas I was
at a wedding with John in Las Vegas and
that was when she was conceived says
she's our little 777 baby
Jones was pretty my water broke with
John
Lila and I were in the library we're in
the public library picking out books
when my water broke so that's kind of a
funny story let's see Oh everybody's
adding me now yay okay let me go back up
to where Gigi was those what after that
Jacqueline says kind of playing off the
advice question what's the best advice
you've ever received doesn't have to be
about YouTube um oh my gosh so many
things I mean I think man I'd have to
think about that one just because I feel
like I implement so many people's advice
to me like I'm very open to advice so
just in general I think I think my
biggest change from you know being a
child to being an adult was when I
stopped worrying so much about what
other people think I still worry about
what other people think a lot but I
think trying to embrace myself and
realizing that I'm not gonna please
everybody I think I still struggle with
that but I think that that's something
that was really good advice that I still
need to work on to be completely honest
but you know I think that that's the
best piece of advice I think that's
great advice if I could just follow it
all the time then that would be awesome
Alexandria says Jen I recently watched
your old video on how to grow your
channel most of the methods don't apply
anymore could you make an updated one
have you watched the one where it's
about how to it's the truth about
improving your YouTube channel without
spending any money that one's still a
good one how to grow your YouTube
channel I see the thing is is I don't I
don't think there's much you can do at
this point that's the problem Alexandria
like as far as growing YouTube channel I
don't there's there's not much I mean
like other than the things that I
mentioned in that video as far as the
things you can do for free I mean it's
it's really all about being unique and
doing something different because
there's literally thousands of beauty
channels out there and you have to you
know going on with your monthly
favorites you have to why does anybody
care what your monthly favorites are
over this person in this person this
person and hundreds of other people so
you trying to be unique I think is the
most and
thinking that those are the channels you
see growing you know you look at like
used Thomas Halbert as an example
I mean he's blowing up right now Robbie
to Christie blowing up right now and
it's because they have these raw unique
personalities and you know of course
they're lighting and all of that is
perfect but I feel like those are the
channels that are really getting
attention there are the ones that have
something unique to bring to the table
personality wise instead of just with
products or you know smokey eye tutorial
kind of thing so I mean I don't even
think that there's I would even have
enough material for a video about how to
grow your channel because I don't think
that I think it's there isn't really
anything we can do at this point I know
that sounds terrible but all you can do
is try to do something that no one else
is doing and hope that people like it
that's what I did with whatsapp in
makeup dry no people would like it a lot
of people do
Oh Fallon's does just want to say I love
your videos oh thank you so much Maggie
says my tough spot is editing I need to
learn so much yeah I mean Final Cut Pro
X is great that's what I use
Nadine says did you see Emily's video
about her kids picking her makeup so
cute I saw the thumbnail and I want to
watch it so bad I haven't had time to
really watch a ton of videos and I have
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 YouTube screens
tabs open right now of videos that I
like started watching that I want to
watch the rest of I like to have that's
what I do is I open up screens of
YouTube videos and just watch them in
little pieces because I can never sit
and watch an entire YouTube video but
that's definitely one I want to watch
I'm sure that it was incredible grace
wants to know how do you find small
youtubers the best way is like let's say
I want to know about the I don't know
the total temptation mascara so I do
total temptation mascara in the search
and then search by the newest filter by
the new
videos that's the best way because it's
gonna give you the most popular ones by
default but if you search by the newest
you'll be able to find smaller youtubers
that's what I do kitty says I always
talk to the camera as though I'm talking
to my friends cuz quite a few of them
are I pretty much think I'm talking to
smart it's a loop a Smurfette Smurfette
I know right
I talked to Lupe through the camera too
Lupe is a long long time subscriber
she's amazing Gwen says do you work out
how do you promote your body positivity
and your personal and family life I used
to work out I used to do CrossFit I
guess it was like maybe four years ago
something like that I did CrossFit and I
was buff like I looked good I looked
really good and then I realized that I
just didn't like CrossFit it was just
too it was too intense it was too much
competition and I was scared was gonna
hurt myself all the time even though I
had amazing trainers if you don't know
if you file a CrossFit 12 labors
it was the gym that I went to it wasn't
called 12 labors and was called
something else it was like an offshoot
because there's a few different gyms
that are called 12 labors but they go to
the CrossFit Games all the time so one
of the guys that was in the well a guy
and a girl that were in the CrossFit
Games his name is Luke sp he was my main
trainer that taught me how to do
CrossFit and he's like a he's amazing
but he's been in the CrossFit Games
multiple times and he's the nicest guy
and he was the only him and Kristin
Kristin Kristin Kristin Kristin oh my
gosh
I can't even say Krista Krista Giordano
I don't want to say it wrong but Christy
Giordano those two who are who've been
in the CrossFit Games those two were the
ones that taught me how to do it and
they were so inspirational but I was
just so scared to hurt myself that I
wasn't going to follow their directions
accurately but so I quit and then I
started just going to the regular gym
and working out and I have a bum foot so
I was having trouble with my foot
swelling up after the gym so I stopped
going now my foot seems to be better so
I should go back and my husband and I
have talked about with me going back I
am probably in the worst shape I've ever
been in in my life as far as like
cardiovascular and muscle wise I'm not
in good shape but how do I promote body
positivity in my personal and family
life I mostly just
I don't know what do I do I mean we eat
we eat healthy foods with my family and
we talk about you know that the most
important thing with being healthy isn't
the way you look but the way that you
treat your body as far as your eating
and your your exercise and my husband's
a good example of that so that's like
kind of say look at daddy and how much
he exercise don't give him up don't look
at mommy mommy doesn't exercise but we
all eat really healthy overall I can't
say we don't have a box of sugar cereal
down there but for the most part we
pretty healthy so that's kind of how we
and we talk about food a lot and the
purpose of food so hopefully that
answered your question
Elise says would you rather have a small
collection that you love or a large
collection you can explore move for
makeup oh that's a tough one man can I
have a middle ground there cuz right now
I have too much stuff and I don't get to
enjoy the stuff that I have so you know
it's one of those be careful what you
wish for kinds of things where I always
wanted to have a huge collection and now
that I do I'm kind of like I wish it was
smaller you know overall because there
are things I can't part with because I
love it so I end up with all of this
stuff but I never get to use it because
I'm always reviewing new things you know
so somewhere in the happy middle they're
smaller than what I have now but larger
than what I had when I started my
channel there we go you ever want to see
what my original makeup collection was
my very first video on this channel you
can sort my videos by oldest is my
entire makeup collection it fit in a bag
like this Elise I already got Elise's
Thank You Elise kara says where did you
get your glasses frames America's best
contacts and eyeglasses and thereby
guests they're not expensive they're
like cheap cheap the cheapest actually
no I think it might have been like more
expensive for there but they're not like
fancy people glasses Hugo says I like
Jeb because you genuinely love makeup I
do I do it's fun Bobby says my daughter
is getting surgery on Monday she's only
2 all baby
well you know what I mean my kids have
very have not had a lot of bad physical
ailments my daughter cut her neck open a
couple of years ago that was the
scariest thing and I just had to keep
breathing and you know I mean you just
got to breathe through it I guess I mean
I'm definitely not the person with the
most experience on that but I wish you
well and your baby oh my gosh it's
heartbreaking to have to watch your kids
go through things like that I hope
everything goes okay keep me updated
Bobby and let me know how she's doing
okay Jessica wants to know any plans for
more kids nope we're done we are tapping
out tapping out on the kids my husband
got is no longer able to have kids he
made we made that choice to make it so
that he could not have any more kids so
no more kids even though the kids keep
begging and everyone smile get baby
fever and think so we want to try to get
that reversed but no I'm almost 42 so
I'm getting a little old to have kids
and plus there would be such an age
difference I want to go through the baby
phase again man like I love babies but
they're hard babies are not easy Gina
wants to know what do you think of
family vlogs where children are very
present on film I have no problem with
family vlogs I think that it's a choice
that families need to make of whether
they want their kids on camera or not I
think that it's also and how you present
your kids to you know making sure that
you're keeping in mind that there could
be creepy people watching so being
really really aware of you know what
they're wearing making sure they don't
have anything on any clothes that have
their school name on them or anything
like that you know making sure the kids
know you know I would never live stream
with my kids because I would be scared
that they would say something
identifying even though they've been
trained not to you know I've put the
fear of God don't want that one but you
know just being really careful with you
know what you present with your kids and
being very deliberate but I have no
problem with I mean I put my kids in my
videos and stuff so I have no problem
with it
Julie says now you should start tagged
for other youtubers to do the same why
kind of main minded tag a little bit I
didn't make it really a tag I'm
hoping that other youtubers do it
because there's no reason not to you
know there's no reason not to and only
takes a few seconds if they don't want
to make a whole video fine in the
beginning of a video that they're
talking about something else say hey I
you know spend 15 seconds hey by the way
I discovered this channel it's called
you know Melissa loves makeup and I just
made that up Melissa loves makeup and
it's a really good channel you guys
should totally check it out now onto my
topic of blah blah can you imagine if
one of these 4 million subscriber
listening nikkietutorials just throwing
it out because she's got a lot of
subscribers you imagine how many
subscribers that person would get just
from that 10 seconds and I'm talking
about if Nikki really loves Melissa
loves makeup not because Melissa loves
makeup after but because nikki loves
Melissa loves makeup I just made it up
it's not real that I know of you know
what I mean like 10 seconds out of these
people's lives could change someone's
life forever you know it just I don't I
don't get it I don't get why they don't
I don't get it they only CLAB with each
other and that's in every community I
mean you look at like Shane dog well
Shane Dawson been doing better in
collabing with other people but like you
look at all of them Tyler Oakley and all
them they they only collab with big
youtubers and superwoman and all them I
don't get it I don't get it at all
Ivy says have you seen desi Perkins
latest video lots of great filming
anything that's one of my windows I have
up it's the desi Perkins filming an
editing video I'm on the part where
she's talking about the backdrops and
she said they just talked about hanging
the backdrops so that's on my list of
things with my open tabs seem is really
good man I just lost all my questions
there were a bunch of questions and I
lost them Natalie wants to know where I
am in the u.s. I'm sorry if I'm missing
your questions I'm not doing it on
purpose I promise I had somebody
messaged me they said that they thought
I was mad at them cuz I wasn't talking
to them on live chat I'm not mad at
anybody I just I don't see everything I
grew up in the Washington DC area just
outside of Washington see just north and
then now I live in the Baltimore area
just south and I've lived in the
Baltimore area since I went away to
college in 2002 2002
and I went to Towson University six
Espinosa says I'm getting my collection
down to things I love and not just stuff
I have to use it feels so good yeah I
hear ya
Courtney at Phoenix says you can tell
you love you love make up to Jen I do I
have fun I love colors I've always loved
colors most of my memories are in colors
like when I think about my bedroom when
I was in first grade I think of the red
carpet you know I had a bright red 70s
looking shaggy carpet that's what I
think I remember things in color you
know I remember the beige of my
grandmother's kitchen so I just I love
color age vanity says I never returned
makeup that was wrong for me and or I
didn't like wait I never returned makeup
that was wrong for me or I didn't like
for some reason especially if it was a
lower cost I have tons of stuff I can't
wear how do I get over returning makeup
I think being responsible about your
purchases but understanding that the I
mean there's it's just such a
complicated thing because you're talking
about landfill waste with a returning
makeup which of course we want to avoid
but you're also talking about you know
wasting your money on things that you'll
never use so I mean I returned makeup I
just returned some stuff to Sephora the
other day I returned for things to
Sephora but of the things you know if
you think of the things other things
that I bought in those purchases I mean
I kept probably 15 things and returned
for you know I just try really hard to
just keep you know be responsible and
when I'm purchasing and intend to keep
it when I buy it so I mean I don't know
I think that's just something you have
to find within yourself it's hard
because everyone's got their things it's
really hard to give advice on that
because every it's such a personal thing
Natasha says if you tried the lifetime
diamond do glitters yet no I haven't
they're brilliant I get so many
compliments when I wear them no fall
either nice yeah I'm not a big fan of
Lime Crime I was starting to warm up to
them a little bit like because I don't
like to hold things against people as
much as possible and there's if you
don't know lime crime drama if this is
new to you you can use Google lime crime
drama and find the whole story but
a big fan of them it's like every time I
start to like be like me and a lime
crime then I end up like no no longer
this that they make some really weird
choices sometimes just mmm
but I'm not opposed to trying stuff I
don't know I don't want to buy stuff
from Lime Crime though I hate that that
I don't want to buy stuff from like
there's very few brands that I feel like
that about see labor says any tips on
growing a brand new beauty channel I
think I already covered that a little
bit earlier basically I was just saying
make a connection with the camera but I
don't want to repeat but you probably
just got here so hi Libra beauty mostly
making connection with the camera let's
see jula day says hi guys
does someone try the mascara from
benefit I have heard the mascara from
benefit I have a very reliable source my
friend Sandra who I met as a subscriber
on my channel and we've hung out
multiple times
she said it's amazing the benefit
mascara so maybe it's good who knows I
think it's kind of weird they did a
whole trip over a mascara but who knows
maybe it's amazing she says it's amazing
mrs. says my mom had me at third and I
my dad was boarding - it's definitely
possible it's the only possible to do
but I don't I think I'm just done that's
just one small factor is my age the big
factor is I don't I don't want to go
through the baby stage again even though
babies are super cute a scientist and
makeup says I thought I wanted a large
collection but it's really overwhelming
I have to actively tell myself to use
products absolutely absolutely Bridget
says Jen you do not look that old oh
thank you Gina says repeat number two
question company contacts it only wants
a positive you to send products thoughts
I said I will always be honest first and
foremost is it normal that they ask that
now it's not normal but sometimes it
does happen I actually had that happen
very recently where it was a company
that promotes for other companies and
they she might even be watching us the
owner of that company hi I'm gonna email
you back but the way they're wording was
on their page made it sound like two
brands that they were guaranteeing
positive
views so I emailed her back and I said
hey you know just so you know I don't do
that there's gonna there's so many
channels out there and I wish you the
best of luck but I don't do that but she
emailed me back and they changed the
wording on the website and no I they
have an event coming up that they wanted
me to go to so I'm thinking about going
it's local so I'm thinking about going
to that but but yeah I just basically
say no no never I will never do that the
only way I would do a guaranteed
positive review is if the the product
was tried and true I had tried it and it
was already gonna be a positive review
whether they paid me or not that would
be the only way I would do it is if I
genuinely truly felt that way before I
agreed to even do it you know what I
mean but it wouldn't be the money that
would make me do that it would be the
product itself but I've never I look at
that's never happened it probably never
will happen usually I just say no no
thank you
there's so many channels that'll do it
guarantee positive reviews so many
channels you really have to go with your
gut on that stuff wants to know Crayola
palette review yes I'm doing it it's on
the way I ordered it I ordered that and
then I ordered their their color switch
that they have and then I ordered one
more thing that I can't remember but I
order three things from them six
Espinoza says me and my guy are getting
his vasectomy reversed cuz we are going
to have a baby aww
congratulations on your on your efforts
that's awesome let's see a hot mess mama
MD is here hello hello let's see a
street says I love the kale polish nail
polish review bought several colors any
more nail polish reviews and it works no
I rarely do them because they don't seem
to be of high interest you know people
say oh you just do it for the views well
if it's not getting views and I'm
obviously people on the they're
subscribed to me aren't really
interested in it so yeah you know the
views really makes a difference in that
that's what I want to know what people
are liking the nail polish videos don't
don't seem to gather a lot of interest
so I don't really plan on doing a lot of
nail polish videos in the future
there's no that I love julep nail polish
those those are my fave
let's get them on be joined the julep
maven program if you're interested in
those because you will get them way way
cheaper than full price they do really
cool mystery boxes to where you can get
that's where I got a lot of my nail
polish I mean you can see like my big
nail polish rack a lot of those are
julep and it's mostly from being part of
their julep maven program let's see
Julie says I think you should start a
tag for the youtubers to make videos to
raise that the underdog youtubers but
you think I kind of did no one's biting
Chris and Anna's hear from Chris Anna
and cosmetic she says I don't like the
baby stage and just skipped us age five
please I know so I haven't have a little
friend
exactly Kourtney's gonna be 40 this
summer me too will be 40 together
let's see Jennifer says have you guys
ever been on a cruise or any other
members we're thinking about have no
idea where to go I get seasick so I've
always been scared to do a cruise so
I've never been on a cruise cuz I get
motion sickness really easily I get
motion sickness in the car like if I try
to edit in the car like while we're on a
trip I can't do it I get sick if I look
at my phone too much in the car I get
sick especially if my husband's driving
like a nut so I don't I don't do I I've
been scared to go on a cruise and people
tell me you know you can't feel it and
all this stuff but I've just been scared
to do it so we haven't done it we do
mostly road trips
yeah someone said the Crayola palette
yeah it's called the crayon case is the
name of the brand and it looks like a
crayon box Gigi wants to know what type
of videos get the most reviews my
favourites are your reviews and study
making news the most views though chose
that the videos get most views are the
ones that have the most drama it's the
truth I mean anything having to do with
controversy gets the most views and I
could make my entire channel about drama
and me talking smack about things and I
my channel would blow up because I have
so much smack to talk but I don't think
that it's worth it
it's not fun it's not fun to have drama
associated with me it's not worth my
mental health so I only I've learned to
only you know do controversial things of
things that you know I feel like the
majority is gonna agree with me with to
be completely honest well and also
things that I feel like are issues that
I just want to stand up for like the
Tarte thing I got a lot of crap for the
Tarte video I got I think over 300
dislikes on that video the Tarte video I
think some people didn't listen because
some of the comments underneath are like
you know you blah blah blah blah blah
and you should say blah blah blah and
it's like the thing that they're
complaining about is actually what I
said in the video so I don't think they
watched but uh but yeah I mean I think
sometimes I just need to stand up for
things I believe in but as far as
creating unnecessary drama on my channel
it's not a good idea it's not a good
it's not worth it
so those get the most views and then my
review videos on popular on products
that are coming out high-end products
get the most views probably after that
and what's up in makeup
what's up in makeup usually gets a lot
of views the main show and then if
there's a really good headline when I
makeup minute those do pretty well but
overall it's mostly the reviews what's
up and makeup but most of all anything
having to do with drama so but I mean
people love the drama people love the
drama positively catatonic says julep or
epsy they're very very different that's
gonna be a personal preference thing
with julep I like the flexibility of
julep that you get to pick what you want
as long as you blog in during a certain
window you can pick the items that you
want which is great if C you don't get a
choice juleps more expensive if see you
know you get little smaller samples you
don't get full-size where do Opie get
full-size but julep you only get julep
products but julep products overall are
very good so I feel like bang for your
buck julep but if you want to try a
bunch of different brands if see if you
want something less expensive Ipsy but
I've been in julep subscriber forever
forever I also like that you can skip a
month of julep too Lori wants me to talk
about Jeffrey I am NOT talking about
Jeffrey smaller there's no point talking
about Jeffers star oh you talk about
like as far as like drama videos that's
that they'd like I had talked to Tabitha
like it like hurt my heart to put him in
the thumbnail this week but I mean I
want it sits that was what that's what's
happening that's what's relevant you
know so that's what we did I even said
to her I was like it's hurts my heart
but as far as like the things that we
had I mean that was the most thing that
I thought people be most interested in
so that's what I put and I've always
wanted to say o'clock at the house so
I'm like really happy that I got to say
o'clock at the house cuz I do really
like watching rich luxe I know that
there's a lot of you know things
surrounding him people like him or don't
like him but I personally I enjoy
watching rich looks i watch drama
channels I'll admit it I do I'll tell
you that I'll tell you the truth I'm not
gonna hide it from you i watch here for
the tea
i watch rich luxe and I watch Peterman I
don't watch anybody else those are my
three favorites I I do watch drama
channels i I want to know what's
happening and the thing is like I go to
Reddit and I read with what people are
talking about on reddit because I want
to know like what people are interested
in what kind of videos are people
interested in what do they like what are
they not like you know I think that's
important to kind of keep your finger on
the pulse and you know knowing the
mistakes that people are making and
making sure that I don't make those same
mistakes is important to me and the best
place to find that is drama channels so
I do it for a personal reason along with
just being nosy I mean I'm human so
Erica says hi love your channel although
I don't have access to almost none of
the products you mentioned aw
I'm wondering what country you live in
you don't
access to them but I'm glad you're
enjoying the channel I think that's
awesome thank you I appreciate it
Roseanna says here for the tea is so
weirdly therapeutic to watch
I definitely don't find her channel
therapeutic I can say that omen Sanders
how can I forget Sanders I watched
Sanders too Sanders was an old friend of
mine from a long long time ago Sanders
and I haven't talked much in the past
year but Sanders I forgot about Sanders
how can I forget about Sanders he was
the one that started it all he did I was
there for it he started the beauty drama
Channel and yeah he didn't start the
drama channel but he started the beauty
chart with John Channel yeah Sarah hi
Sarah
Sarah says this is why I could never do
a YouTube channel I don't like the drama
yeah it's definitely drama whether you
want it or not
it's there man sometimes very
unintentionally you know Sarah I met on
my road trip Welbeck Oh Natasha says so
so when people so annoying when people
do sucking up reviews because they're
told or want to say stay on a PR list so
many do this unlike you yeah I mean
sometimes especially like there's some
bigger youtubers which I cannot name and
I'm sorry to do that but I'm not gonna
call anybody out because I think that
would be very rude of me to call people
out but if you you know there are
certain people that they only do I mean
like every every single video where they
get something sent to them it's positive
every single one and you know I'm like
watching negative things happen and they
don't say anything about it and it's
like really so that's how it is why
bother watching these videos why bother
if all you're gonna do is just talk
about the pot I mean I get it and they
can do whatever they want in their
channels but it's just not my personal
taste I mean maybe it's personality
maybe they enjoy the person's
personality and that's why they watch
not because they want to get a review
but I'm a very research person I love
research
I love facts I love you know looking
into things and you know finding you
know you know finding out what the truth
is on something
and like I don't I don't I don't watch
youtube videos for the most part I don't
watch them like if they're presenting
information to me I want it to be
factual if they're gonna entertain me
fine but I can't watch someone knowing
they're not giving me factual
information I can't watch a video for
entertainment you know I just I can't I
feel like it messes with my head because
I don't want to remember something you
know that they mentioned something
positive when it's obvious that it's not
good you know what I mean like it
bothers me but everyone has a right to
watch whatever channels they want to
watch it's me says hi Jen good morning
what's your opinion of polish'd choice
skincare products that's one of my
favorite skincare brands I love Paulo's
choice skincare I do I love them a lot
and full disclosure they do
semi-products I'm on their PR list but
but I do really love their products I
feel like I wish that there was a way
for me to test them individually without
the use of other products and that's
this is why I don't really like
reviewing skincare I don't I don't like
reviewing it I just got an offer to do a
couple of sponsored videos for for
another skincare brand a big skincare
brand and I'm thinking about it you know
because I do want to try the products
I'm really genuinely interested in them
they're offering me a really really nice
you know situation there but this the
hard part about reviewing skincare is
that you know everything you're using
interacts with the other things you're
using and in a skincare routine you're
using multiple things so it's really
hard to tell what's causing whatever
results you have so really the best way
to know whether something's you know
working is when it's not working you
know that it's not working you know what
I mean but if something is working it's
hard to know what's causing it to work
so I really I try not to do skincare
reviews I might just do it and just
present the ingredients without like
solid results cuz they're not giving me
a lot of time either to test the
products they're not giving me a
sufficient amount of time to tell you
whether they work or not so I might just
present the information as far as the
ingredients because I've been getting a
lot of requests for you know how to find
products with good ingredients like what
ingredients to look for on the labels so
I might be able to use these products in
that way because they're giving me full
creative control so instead of like
talking about whether it actually works
just focusing on the in green
impart which might be doable but we'll
see we'll see what happens I don't know
its skin care so hard but with polished
choice I have a video where I used a
routine of their resist line and you
could see noticeable differences and now
that I'm like off of all of the things
that have been sent to me I'm going back
to my polished choice that's what I'm
using mostly now I have the toner I have
the exfoliation the the chemical
exfoliator last night it's it's
fantastic stuff the ingredient list is
on point on point I know there are some
people that have had bad experiences
with it but all my experiences the
polished joy stuff has been positive but
I don't have sensitive skin either
Carmen says hi Jen thank you for your
thorough and in-depth skin care reviews
between you and Stephanie Nicole I've
learned so much about what ingredients
are going to give me the best results oh
that's awesome thank you so much for
that I appreciate it
Charlie wants to know if philosophy is
good on the whole no on the whole lot of
philosophy products are not good they
have a lot of a lot of them have alcohol
in them a lot of them are loaded up with
things they don't really do much like
texture ingredients they you'll see
glycerin a lot which is a good
ingredient but then it'll just be a
bunch of like textural you know with to
help with the consistency of it and you
won't see any actual skincare stuff
until way later one thing you can watch
out for that I do is phenoxyethanol is a
very common preservative so look where
the phenoxyethanol is and then anything
after that is probably going to be a
negligible amount of an ingredient and
I've noticed a lot lately especially
with different skincare brands that the
good ingredients are like way at the
bottom after the preservative you know
and that's kind of how I know whether
something's good or not but usually
honestly like in the philosophy products
I've looked at don't have a lot of skin
benefits but I'm not saying that all of
them because I don't look at all of them
I can't say all of them but the ones
that I've looked at and I can't tell you
off the top of my head which ones I've
looked at specifically but yeah I just
check out the ingredient list you know
Google the first five ingredients and
see what you find out I Environmental
Working Group they'll be very careful
because they sometimes have a lot of
scare things in there that are based on
the studies that they base them on or
sometimes a little shaky on how they
would apply to a cosmetic product so
they may like put a 50% concentration on
a rat you know over a period of you know
a month or something and put them under
direct sunlight and that's how they
found out that it was bad you know what
I mean like something that would never
happen in cosmetics so just be careful
with ewg the best site that I've found
is what's it called hone i meant let me
find out what's clucks i always forget
what it's called truth in aging
there we go truth in aging is really
really good that's a fantastic website
for looking up ingredients Gigi says
poor rat I know I know
I agree poor rat absolutely fear next
Courtney says I think Paula's Choice
reviews are useful with a grain of salt
yeah I mean I think we're I think you
might be going with this is that
everybody's individual results vary and
I think that certain lines seem to cause
be the most effective like I personally
love the resist line but I've never
tried any of their other stuff and also
I have normal skin so what my works for
me and my normal skin with my anti-aging
concerns is different than what someone
with oily skin or acne prone skin or dry
skin what their experience would be with
their other lines you know what I mean
so you definitely have to take any skin
care reviews any makeup reviews you have
to kind of take with a grain of salt and
try to apply it to your own situation
Whitney saw it wouldn't you want to know
what you do a video on what skin care
lines you would use right now I the big
ones that I can recommend from personal
experience or polished choice and best
and beauty by Nicole Guerrero those are
my two favorites at this point
everything else I've tried it just kind
of been okay or bad oh I just skipped
down
Seraphina says what age do you think you
should start wearing anti-aging products
I would say as early as possible
you know once you're an adult I'd say
you know even at 20 18 20 it can't hurt
the aerosol says go to your Dharma yeah
I definitely go to a dermatologist
absolutely Oh Carol inherence yeah she's
awesome she's on Twitter she she she was
answering questions for people on my
Twitter which was awesome Arden
Thornberry says do you have any advice
for college students who love makeup I
want to try new stuff but I just can't
afford it college students who love
makeup hmm let's see I would say follow
fair Nicks and look at the indie brands
I think that that's that's a good place
to go because a lot of times you can get
stuff that's really really really really
really good quality for less expensive
than you would pay for the high-end
stuff watch a lot of reviews and just be
really selective about what you're
buying I think that's part of it
Jessica Braun's a great channel for
drugstore products that are really
really good I'm just kind of seeking out
the lower price things that are also
high quality I think that's really the
best thing you can do you know in
college I was definitely on the lift and
noodle diet in college so I totally get
it
I get it
let's see color pop and shop hush hot
mess mama MD says yes that's a good idea
yeah and and hot mess mama MD if you
didn't see my video she has the video on
a lot of videos on the shop lush
products for the dupes it's a great idea
thank you it's me
says Jen what do you think of Beauty
pedia reviews do you find them true to
your own experiences with the product I
really haven't been over there a whole
lot but I think anytime you have a mass
of reviews because honestly I don't I
haven't really looked over there I don't
know much about Beauty pedia I should
look that up and see what in the world
you're talking about I've heard of it
people gonna be like you've never used
Beauty pedia what kind of person are you
let me look and see I've got my eyes on
it I'm looking let's see dude dude dude
it's loading hmm yeah I haven't I
haven't really looked at this site I
mean I think that any reviews you have
to read multiple reviews no matter the
source you know reading multiple reviews
I think is important you know and oh
Beauty PD is by polish choice oh thank
you so much Courtney I appreciate that
I take Polish choice information on
their site with a grain of salt because
they are a retailer any time you have a
retailer telling you that ingredients
are good you have to take it with a
grain of salt because they're of course
going to recommend ingredients that they
use in their products so you know I if I
use yeah she says the same thing Cortney
there you go I didn't realize it was by
polish choice yeah you have to so what I
would do is I would cross-reference
anything you learn from anywhere on
polish choice I would Crawford
cross-reference that with truth and
aging with ewg with you know a bunch of
other sites you know google it find
other places where they talk about it
and cross-reference that information and
see if you can get things that match up
that's what I usually do is I look at a
bunch of different places
that after five says do you think it's
worth starting a beauty channel with all
the saturation does one have a fighting
chance to be successful I think it's
what how you define your success you
know do you define your success as being
at you know nikkietutorials jeffree star
Laura Lee mani mu a level or do you
define your success as growing a
community of people who appreciate the
information that you have to offer and
it's not about the numbers it's not
about the numbers I think should totally
go for it if you're trying to be here
and that's your only goal because you're
trying to make money and you're trying
to be famous I would say don't do it
it's not worth it unless you've got some
kind of like magical idea that makes you
incredibly unique I would say it's not
worth it
but if you just want to create videos
because you love doing it and because
you want to share you know your ideas
and you want to create a community and
communicate with people and express
yourself absolutely do it it's just what
is your what is your goal you know
what's your goal so that's where I'm at
with it but you can't you can't start
your you can't start a YouTube channel
because you're trying to make money I
had somebody contact me they said they
start a YouTube channel because they
needed money and they wanted me to
promote the channel because they need
money I was like no that's not gonna
work because I mean they had one that I
think they might have had one video and
it's not it takes so long to make money
and the thing is you can't even make
money at this point if you start a new
channel right now and you you you can't
even make money so you get a thousand
subscribers in four thousand hours of
video so even if I promoted this person
even if I said hey check out this
channel she needs money she's still not
gonna make any money
she's not gonna four thousand hours of a
thousand subscribers you know especially
the four thousand hours off of just my
shoutout so it's just it's not even
worth it and even when you do get to
that four thousand hours and though the
1000 subscribers then you have to
continue to create content that makes
money you know and it's gonna be slow so
it's just it doesn't even make any sense
Lupe says Jenn please don't do the
ridiculous mixing on my foundations
video I I've seen some of them they're
cute but I'm not doing it I don't really
do the gimmicky
and I guess gimmicky might not be the
nicest war but I don't only do a lot of
those maybe that's why my channel is not
growing because I don't do things like
the glitter you know full face of
glitter challenge and the mixture
foundation is challenging we no shade to
anybody that does them I think you know
they get a lot of use you know if your
audience likes something if your
audience liked something then go for it
you know do it but I don't really do
that stuff so no no worries Lupe I'm not
doing it Michelle says polished choice
doesn't always recommend her line over
others beauty pedia is a separate
component that's great that's awesome
and good for her for for the for the
brand for not for you know not
recommending their line over others
that's cool
but I still take it with a grain of salt
though that's just me I mean I'd rather
be overly skeptical that's just the way
I feel I feel like I'd rather be overly
skeptical then too you know then just
overly trust it's just that's just the
way that I feel but thank you for that
let's be real case says your channel is
growing everyone I've talked to you love
you yeah my channel is growing well I
mean it's not blowing up but it's doing
well I mean I almost doubled subscribers
last year which to me you know shows
that people are enjoying what I'm doing
so I'm happy about that yeah I'm
definitely not complaining in any way
I'm not complaining I hope it doesn't
sound like I'm complaining
cuz I'm not at all at all I'm very happy
so the Eric Staal says I wish you and
Jeffery star could be friends I don't
only see that being a match you know
like you know you see people and it's
like I don't think we get along very
well to be completely honest I just
don't I don't think we would get along
you know we're totally different places
in our lives where we're not you know
we're not of the same mindset on a lot
of things I don't think we would get
along if he if he gave me a shout-out
I'm sure I'd get a lot of subscribers
but I don't think that I could be
friends with him I just don't I don't
think he's my kind of people you know
and this is just from his public persona
I don't know him personally but I can't
really see I can't really see that ever
happening even if it was an option
Gigi wants know if I'll buy the new
Jeffrey star palette no no I'm not gonna
buy that it's not my thing unless the
color scheme isn't my thing either okay
I've been asked this a lot lately it's
actually uh we're an hour in so I'm just
gonna answer this one more kate says
kate evans says at what age do you think
it's appropriate to start wearing makeup
I think that it's a personal choice
between the parent and the child my
daughter doesn't care about makeup she's
not interested in it she has no interest
at all in makeup but I started wearing
makeup at 13 and I feel like it's
whatever the comfort level is with the
parent and the child but I think that's
the intention behind it that's important
why does the child want to wear makeup
are they do they have acne and it makes
them self-conscious and they want to use
some concealer to cover up their acne or
you know in the parent and the child
agree that this is something that's
important to them or is the parent very
much into trying to help the child
embrace who they are acne at all you
know I think it's it's a cultural thing
within the family of where we're going
with it I think if it gives for me
personally with my child if it's
something that she enjoys and has fun
with then I would definitely you know at
twelve thirteen if she want to start
wearing makeup I wouldn't have a problem
with it
but if the point of wearing makeup is to
get the attention of boys that's
something that I have I I would
personally have an issue with with my
child I think that it shouldn't be about
that it should be about self-expression
it should be about you know feeling
happy with yourself and enjoying the way
that it looks on yourself and and if it
makes you happy in your heart to wear
makeup and you look at yourself and feel
like it makes you you know more
confident I have no problem with that at
all
I feel like anywhere under 12 is a
little bit it's kind of pushing it like
when I used to teach we would have some
fourth graders sometimes come in with
full face and makeup we had a couple of
kids that I taught like that which I
thought was a little bit young because I
feel like a full face and makeup at that
age and the way that the girls were I
just I didn't think it was a good idea
but I respect the parents right to allow
their children to wear whatever makeup
they choose it's their kid and they have
a right to do whatever but for me
personally I think
that as long as the mindset is there for
a personal reason and not an external
reason like it's all about something for
themselves and not about trying for
someone else then I feel like you know
1213 I have no problem with it that's
just me personally you know a little bit
of eyeshadow and a little bit of lip
gloss at 13 I was wearing black eyeliner
at 13 I was like a rimming it out you
know is 1991 man Rikki Rockett and
headbangers ball all right I got a pop
off here we got a got a mix I didn't
even breakfast yet make sure my kids are
good we got my daughter's concert today
