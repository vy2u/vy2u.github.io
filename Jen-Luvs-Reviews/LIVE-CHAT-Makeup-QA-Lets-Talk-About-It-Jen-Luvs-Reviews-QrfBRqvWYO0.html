happens with the for black friday on the
twentieth sephora will be releasing all
their black friday deals on their app
there will be a section on the app for
their black friday deals so no one knows
yet but we'll find out in five days um
yes yes yes alright so let me just give
you an update on the pallets that i've
been using i did go a little nuts at the
sephora VIP room sale i especially want
to update you on the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette this is the big woman I want
to I want to tell you guys about I was
thinking but the reason why I did not
purchase this before it was like yeah
it's another neutral palette do I need
another neutral palette no do I need it
for review no I couldn't justify the
purchase every time I walk by this thing
called to me it's a jet by me you need
to buy me and I said no it don't need
you I think I needed this in my life I
I'm really happy that I have this these
shades are not ordinary not boring
they're not the typical eyeshadow
palette they're not um what I was
expecting at all I was expecting you
know like a naked naked asst is a
fantastic palette but it's not like
anything that's so super unique that you
can't get anywhere else I think the
chocolate bar is is super unique I mean
some of these shades of crazy as far as
like this one that I used am I getting
ready with me this is the crème
brûlée creme brulee it has rose gold
on underboob that has rose gold
undertones like what really and then
this one isn't just white it's white
with pink undertones like what what this
one has this is purple with some pink
sparkle in it what I mean this is a
gorgeous rose gold-tone and then you've
got things to balance it out you know
you've got the white chocolate for your
brow bone you can use milk chocolate or
salted caramel and a crease I mean and
if your deeper skin tone you can use
triple fudge in your crease I mean like
what this is now must out for me I feel
like I would recommend this to anybody
beginners experienced makeup users it's
a fun palette and it's not forever to
make it great too don't get me wrong
Nick it's great but naked is it's
amazing but it's not like unique like
that like this is perfect for somebody
that's just starting out make-up
somebody that's um you know they're just
getting used to make up they're just
starting to figure out how it all works
this is perfect if you're looking for
just a solid neutral palette for travel
this is perfect but if you've got a ton
of eyeshadows already and you've got
neutral palette out the wazoo do you
need the Naked palette maybe not I don't
know it's a fantastic palette though
fantastic if you got a stupid glitch and
you may not need this oh I feel like you
need the chocolate bar that's my pink
because it's so unique and amazing um
I'm gonna go ahead and scroll up a bit
and read some of the comments so far oh
let's saged I missed a lot okay here we
go nat says I'm saving so live
vicariously through you hahahaha good
morning Stephanie good to see you hey
Jen are you going back to New York I'm
ass this year i believe tickets are
already up I've not purchased them yet I
was actually just talking to John about
that last night we called back yeah I'm
asked this year and he's like I don't
know you want to that guy Matt sounds
like yeah I think I want to go back to
eye mask but we didn't buy a ticket yet
so long as you're still on sale when I
buy them I'm going to be going that's
the plan alright let's see Chloe ivana
holiday kits in your previous videos
which one is your favorite kind of like
in the UM in the video it really depends
on who you are which one is going to be
best so that's why didn't call it a
favorites because what's favorite for me
isn't this really fair for other people
but i would say my favorite of the
holiday releases
it's gotta be this this is my finger
Holly releases because I don't know
anything like this I own the Urban Decay
the electric palette that's too hard to
blend it's beautiful it's pigmented it's
amazing but it's too hard to blend this
thing is so easy to blend it's amazing
it's so fun i love it i absolutely love
it oh well how many releases i would say
that's my favorite um the sets as far as
things that i like sets the tart brush
set has been really fun to play with I
really been enjoying that a lot
hopefully that answer your question
Chloe I'm hoping all right oh it's
Marlene's birthday happy birthday
Marlene yay I'm not gonna sing to you
cuz I don't sing well and what's gone
early in the morning roomie me trying to
doing anything alright tomorrow hey Jen
you can just call me tani all right
Tammy I got you Tammy got it if I do
that again and call you tomorrow you
just let me know and I'll call you Tammy
you might need to remind me all right
yes chocolate all right crafts and craft
lands 62 forewarning opinion on the
Maybelline blush nudes can you show it
and maybe swatch the purple kind of
light shades love your channel i don't
think i have it out I have to find it so
if you time out for a second I'll get
the bag that I think it's in because I
don't use it because i don't i don't use
it I'm on set let me see if I can find
them really quickly I can find it really
quickly i'll totally knew that I needed
to hear oh ok looks great here you go my
friend this is the Maybelline blush
nudes okay swash the purple cut and kind
of light shades I do have a video with
all these swatch but since you're here
let's say let's do five look all my
things are coming out but you gotta
remember too is the swatches don't
necessarily represent what you're going
to get on the eyes hey
finger swatches okay there you go
there's the let me get one more this is
the top rope seems like you're
interested in the top row right there
there's the top row swatch beautifully
don't they but they end up kind of
powdery and I when you show you in a
brush and just watch that purple with a
brush for you I have an old squash their
excuse me would see how it goes on real
patchy with the brush it's real patchy
it makes a difference makes a big
difference when you put it on with a
brush so it just takes work it's not a
bad palette it just takes work you just
gotta be willing to sit there for a bit
to make your look work but it's not I
mean like I said it's not bad palette
you know it's fine if you don't want to
buy naked 3 and you're willing to work
for it sure go for it man but it's
definitely let me show you so you see
like these over here when I try to blend
them see how this lighter shades are
gone thats that's kind of what I'm
talking about too is that that part is
not good those are these these three
here is three one two three yeah so
that's that's the blush nudes if you
want any more questions about all we got
there because i'm going to scroll down
and go in order so if you have any more
questions about that i'll get to the
more questions about that one but
hopefully that was tell full first time
live yeah ms Higgy i'm glad you're here
that makes me happy and yes nelly it
smells like chocolate yes it does
Marlene I like the earnest look on your
face when you said Jen by me I'll to
watch it back on reflex I don't know
what I look like I can't see myself
right now I'm looking at the netflix add
of some kind of candy something or
another so I I can't I don't know what
I'm looking like right now so all right
um Lindsay Monica I don't know about the
chocolate and I was so happy with the
smell yes oh it does smell good Nikki
the chart contour Palace up on some
foreign tartlet to is now also i want
the contour pot you
we missed that this week Nikki in the in
the show somehow it got missed I had the
picture of it and it wasn't in the
script and I don't know how i ended up
missing it so i'm sad i missed it i was
trying to figure out a way to insert the
picture of it goes thing about adding
like text underneath them like inserting
it with just the text but it was just
messing with the flow and yes the
contour palette is up and i'm sad i
missed it this week let's see steph
tartlet to is not a better not
disappoint mean you just watch it first
I agree I want to swatch first I'm not
planning on buying it but I would
definitely want to swatch it and see
what the deal is with it shantal love
your reaction the chocolate bar palette
that's the way I feel about it alright
let's see Pena on the Maybelline
blushing it's okay got it I already did
that we're good I'll get to you no
worries it's one of those were what I'm
going to do with those of you there
watching commenting I'm just scrolling
down this is what I used to do before we
had like targeted topic chats I'm just
starting the top and I'm scrolling down
so i'll get to your comment hopefully in
the next 45 minutes that would be the
goal to gets everybody's gummint uh Tara
says she loves the chocolate bar the
semi-sweet not so much that's what I
heard too and I'm not going to get the
semi-sweet I'm happy with the original
ok ok just says stop general going to go
online any min if you keep saying that
probably about the chocolate bar palette
alright i skip all the ones that say at
someone else but i'll go you know I'm
assuming that's something that you don't
want me to read and I'll be able to go
faster if I skip those all right
Brittany half the reason I bought the
chocolate bar palette was for the
packaging and that is the smell like
chocolate and the names of the shadows
and the blendabilities fantastic it is
amazing it's absolutely amazing all
right Lorraine says and of course uh
seeing it's made with real cocoa and
smells like chocolate I know right okay
thanks tab she has never been in chat
before it's okay alright Nellie says
come to Philadelphia and live with me
I've got a wonderful house with
wonderful kids and a wonderful husband
so I don't know if that's gonna happen
but I appreciate the offer Katie system
when the chocolate bar shades are
somewhat hard with lots of chunky
glitter you know I haven't gotten to
them yet uh
so I i'm using what three or four times
though zippy with our periscope with me
so you're talking probably about this
Black Forest truffle one and see this
one this white chocolate heaven I mean I
hope chocolate I have any problems with
but maybe these two here are we're
talking about like I haven't I haven't
really delved into those too much so
maybe that's why one thing I was
disappointed with was the gilded ganache
it actually turns gray when you blend it
all the green blends away so I was
really disappointed in that um this
shade is not good it's beautiful gray
but it's not green it's not green at all
once you blend it in so yeah I was not
happy about that okay all right mary
says Jen how are you I'm good thank you
how are you thank you for the gift ideas
I can't ways the kat von d beauty chat
me either i'm in love with maybe a local
palate me too all right Leslie good
morning to you my dear I'd Leslie says
she wants to me vida loca it is fam
Monica says how is the tartlet two
different I have to look I think it's
just different shades I think it's the
same concept but they've just tweaked
the shades a bit is what it looks like
let's see craft lands 624 is it good for
teens I want to get my cousins because
they like lighter shades I talked about
the blush nudes if they're good with
makeup I would say go for it but the
problem thing what I was saying a
problem with it is that they these
lighter shades will blend away and that
they're um you know they're not they're
just difficult to work with but you can
make it work if you're good with makeup
you can totally make it work um let's
see Thank You tabatha for the
clarification on that Stephanie she was
just talking about that what she's heard
about the palette 78 I got that
yesterday with the steven klein nars
cheek pouch oh I'd love to know how that
is amanda says yes the first live chat I
made it to a few minutes late that's
okay Amanda we're happy to have you here
um crafted 64 I like the Maybelline
because elf has parabens yeah and and
that's Evan Lee something to consider
and everyone has our different opinions
on parabens I need to educate myself
more on parabens because some people say
that it's not a big deal because someone
said something up parents are in bananas
or something I don't know I'm not
educated enough to speak about it but
but I know some people are really really
against the parabens and some
people say it's not a big deal so I
don't know Kathy says do you have the
Kat Von D shade and light for eyes if so
do you like it no I did not get that I
got the contour face palette instead so
I was thinking about getting the shin
light for eyes and I ended up passing on
it i was gonna get it the roof sale and
I was like and I don't really need it so
I let it go but I've heard wonderful
things about it wonderful things uh yeah
Chloe I'm glad I helped you i'm so glad
about that you are very welcome for the
birthday wishes Marlene steph says a
somewhat like cocoa puffs you know I
never thought about that song again
little bit little cocoa puffs e I feel
like it smells more like hot chocolate
like like you're gonna make a cup of hot
cocoa I've kind of wearing that but I
kind of see the cocoa puffs kind of see
that I love me some cocoa puffs I on a
cocoa puffs in years alright have a says

holiday palette I was this close I was
like there's no reason for me to have
this palette no reason I can't if I
review it I can review it with an after
I review it it's like what am I going to
do with it

you know I can't really talk about and
watch after the holiday season so I
didn't get it but i'm telling you i
swatched and it seemed really nice so i

tell from swatches how things are gonna
work on the eyes either but it really
seemed nice thanks i want them to use it

Sammy says debating between the cargo
Venice pound and the bomb your hands
pallet looking for help on which way to
go you know I got a cargo pallet once
you long ago that's right here and this
is the cargo northern lights palette you
know I am not happy with this at all
like the the shades are there either
very glittery and leave the sparkle on
my cheeks or they're difficult to work
with this one's getting hard pan like I
I seriously was not happy with this cow
at all some of them are powdery the
white is very powdery here having
trouble with polar here which is a
necessity for me to have some kind of
champagne color and every palate that I
own if I wanted to be workable without
having to grab from other palettes um
and I wasn't impressed and that may be
sad because I do have a cargo pallet
that I love it is sams Bingley loud
you
Oh does it you can hike like me that was
it so if the cargo Venice pound is
anything like that I wouldn't recommend
a cargo pallet if it's anything like
that hopefully you I guess you can't
really swatch it I would look up reviews
and that the in your hands power from
the ball looks amazing I did see it at
where was i I was at UM coals and i
swatched it I mean I own have a thing
zynga mad because I'm a huge the bomb
fan a fun time just watching it and it
seems amazing just because I know it's
amazing because I know of
toran there I own but it's um they're so
distracting though I can't even focus so
anyway um they're very different though
because ones and I showed problem one is
more of like an eye / face palette so
personally I would pick the ball that's
me based on my experiences with things
that's what i would do Sammy but I'm not
saying that the cargo pallet is that I
would look at some reviews on the cargo
pallet and then the ball palette is
gonna be good though it's good Monica oh
and the toilet too is more of a brown
pink all the names are funny thanks
Nikki oh thank you very much Monica for
that all right Nikki so she didn't like
the Maybelline ones shantou says I
started to hit pan on my steal it in the
moment palette I'm gonna close the door
because I'm getting really distracted
don't sound right somebody quiet all
right I can't focus it's like hard for
me to because there's a lot going on
over here um I hate started hip Allen on
the ceiling in the moment pop yet um
yeah in the moment I have in the garden
I don't easy in the garden that much but
I you know what I really like it the
eyes are the window palette those things
are amazing I have eyes are the window
to the spirit and I love it um Monica
said Sammy cargo is a hidden gem it's so
good awesome maybe i just got a dud
palette I don't know Nellie says you
have the tart light of the party and if
so could see some swatches your favorite
shades I do not have tart right of the
party I don't have that one I'm sorry if

want to make sure I put a good solid
review in there I'm thinking about doing
a review of some of the best products I
got in my generation beauty swag bag as
reviews for this because I got some
really good stuff that I'd love to share
with you guys um oh no KJ ran out of
coffee oh no Valerie I want really one
of the new Marc Jacobs foundation as
anyone tried it at combo skin but heard
its really bad for dry spots thought the
only Marc Jacobs foundation hook I Owen
is a one heck of a cream foundation
smother find it right here this is the
one that I own it is the marvelous
mousse foundation it's drying out it's
kind of old I've used the stink out of
it i mean you can see it's like totally
hitting glass on this one I came and say
pan because there's no pan in here but
um it's very this one is pretty full
coverage it's very creamy but I have
normal skin so that's why it's not like
I wish I could tell you as far as for
dry skin how this works so we need to be
the collective rate of makeup
awesomeness on this one and hit at
Valerie Stewart if you have opinions on
the new Marc Jacobs foundation it looks
amazing you talk about the one that's
kind of frosty looking it's like
dome-shaped it's kind of frosty I think
that's the one you're talking about all
right let me take this Brooklyn and you
notice of cooking alright alright let's
see oh thank you kristen i love you too
all right my my chat window scroll down
so i gotta find where i was that to go
up a bit so give me just a second this
thing is very hard to navigate um and
especially since there's so many awesome
comments in here it's hard for me to
find where i was there we go i found it
okay speaking of cargo nikki says kohls
is having double beauty points if you
earn kohls cash i think there is a ten
dollar off fifty dollar coupon on nuvo
cheeks blog thank you so much that nikki
nikki is a wealth of information I don't
know what I would do without Nikki Nikki
gives me so much information like she's
amazing Nikki 6543 on Instagram if you
are interested in an awesome as
Instagram to follow nikki sixx
5 4 3 Nelly what is your favorite BB
cream concealer in the market for a new
one all right BB cream the problem of my
finger BB creams and I think they're all
being discontinued so these are gone if
you can find these ponds BB creams these
things are so fab um the other one this
is a good one I know it's a CC cream but
it's not very full coverage this one you
can still get i believe the Lumia time
for ECC anti-aging correct and cream
this stuff is good I need to go to the
drugstore and get more BB creams because
all of mine are discontinued the other
one that is not a hand in the Garnier BB
cream which i think is also being
discontinued so unfortunately I have
favorites but they're not available
anymore except for this one I believe
this is available and no this is a CC
cream but like I said it's a lighter
coverage um someone to stay away from
this one is terrible this baby this one
right here this covergirl smoothers it
just has no coverage like a tinted
moisturizer so if you want any kind of
coverage this is not going to be good
concealer um oh you were looking for any
BB cream not just drugs for um I have
other BB creams and most of them drugs
or BB creams this is really nice have
been enjoying this cargo one that I got
in my generation beauty swag bag of
roaming is yet it cosmetics one is
amazing a lot of you will really love
the Acosta's one so if you want more
higher-end one higher end one it
cosmetics one is awesome um so that
would be that as far as concealer those
of you that are around a lot no my
favorite concealer right now so I
apologize for the repeat information but
right now the bare minerals multitasking
SPF 20 concealer corrector mine is in
summer bisque this is amazing this is
what we're going to do let me show you
how this works I want to flip around my
phone with you I'm not marry you right
now I could show you the amazingness
that is this i'm just going to use this
wet and wild brush we flip over my
camera view i'm gonna show you how this
concealer works because you should need
to appreciate all right i am wearing
some stuff on my face though today i
don't know if it's gonna work the magic
on a bare face you can really see it but
okay it's not showing up as much because
I think my could my like my uh no no I
didn't really have dark circles and
works i think my foundation covered it
up I'm actually wearing the Garnier BB
cream but you can you can see a little
bit of a difference how this like
totally muted out like this shadow right
here is gone over here you see that I
don't know I got even it out on Annette
we turn this other light because I'm
gonna make sure you're getting an
accurate view of what's happening here
okay you see if you can see it now can
you see the difference I didn't really
have dark circles so it's hard when I
looked at it um at the at the camera
view I realized that my dark circles
really aren't there right now I did get
lots of sleep last night to which
definitely helps as well but like I
don't know if you saw that happen if
you're watching this on replay you'll
have to tell me whether it made a
difference I mean I think it totally
made a difference so anyway this is my
favorite that thing is my favorite
concealer I've ever used it's amazing i
got this in that $30 bare minerals like
mystery kit this is a mini size but i
don't know if i'm an able to live
without this concealer for the rest of
my life I think this is gonna be a
repurchase forever like oh my gosh what
you're seeing what I'm seeing because I
feel like I'm seeing a difference you
know I already have foundation on that I
think cover up most of the discoloration
so all right I'm going to switch back to
the chat room view and hopefully that
you guys got the impression there
hopefully all right so that would be my
favorite concealer right now let's see
Nellie says what about the new chocolate
bonbons Oh kicking myself if she had it
on there for a point perk and I missed
it it was sold out before I got there
and I'm so sad because I had enough
points to get it and I couldn't get it
it looks cool I really feel like that
you're pushing it on the hearts man I
don't know if you guys feel like this
but I feel like to push it on the hearts
it reminds me the way that it's set up
it reminds me of like the like
children's makeup that you can get at
like
Marshalls like in like the kids make up
section you know like how to have like
kids cosmetics and yeah they got the
little eunos glittering little lip
glosses with a little glittering tops
and you know little animal looking
things and you know you got the little
eye shadow palette that shaped like
little hearts like I don't know I I was
with him with the heart blushes I was
with them with that but I feel like
they're pushing it like I feel like it's
almost like a little kid looking not
saying anything about the quality I have
no idea about the quality I've never
seen it I haven't seen any reviews on it
yet but i don't know i think they're
pushing it with the age appropriateness
anything i guess all that matters is
whether it works or not right now the
packaging doesn't matter it's what it
works you're not but I'm curious to see
whether it actually works nikki says
tart only announced at friday late
afternoon we didn't know early oh that's
why okay that's why we missed it we're
talking about the torque contour palette
it wasn't in the show and I'm like oh so
cuz I didn't realize that it wasn't in
the show until i was editing so there
was no way to put it in I didn't know it
exists exciting yet means now Tabitha's
doing all of my Tabitha who's in here
she's nerdling full-on in the chat right
now she does all of my scripting for me
and gets all my pictures healer for me
she's my production manager she's
amazing so I didn't look at the pictures
I need to start looking at the pictures
before I film I'm just really just focus
on reading the script first but I really
need go through and look at all the
pictures first make sure you don't miss
anything to make sure I know what
everything looks like so i just realized
i didn't i didn't pay my nails before
doing this I nails look like horrible
you'll forgive me though so that's my
phone I dropped the ball on that one why
it's not in the show I'll totally take
that one all right um let's say CH cart
on the cart I Harrison says the tart
contour pouch looks so pretty it does
and it looks like it's got nice neutral
contour shades which I feel like is kind
of a necessity for contour me I'm not a
makeup artist but I feel like a warm
contour isn't really a contour it's a
bronzer I don't know I mean Marlena from
makeup geek released those beautiful
contour shades and some of them she said
some of them are warm and some of them
are cool but from
I understand contour shades are supposed
to be neutral because shadows don't have
tom so I was a little confused by that
why they would be warm contour shades
like I don't know and I'll get that like
I don't know maybe I'm ignorant about
maybe I just don't understand and I'm
not trying to say I'm more knowledge
about makeup them more Elena because I
don't I don't I definitely don't but
that confuse me because it went against
what i thought contour shades were
supposed to be i thought that they kind
of had to be neutral because the point
is that you're creating a shadow and
shadow doesn't have a warm or a cool
tone maybe um that's my thoughts I'm too
far away from from any comments on this
so I can't see what you guys are saying
but I'm hoping you're with me I'm
Veronica first time live i'm so glad
that you're here thank you for being
here like Chantal says I'm curious about
the two-faced bon bons palette and I'll
be similar to their other two chocolate
pouts me too Nellie says i love the
chart BB cream for years Thank You
Monica for that collective brain
collective brain Jennifer Jen and ladies
how do you keep your palates free of
germs if you want to keep them for years
like spray it with something girlfriend
I don't do anything i'm not i'm not a
german person like I I don't even think
about it how terrible is that I don't
even because with eyeshadow it's a
powder so it's not like it's getting in
your eye you know I mean it's just
laying on top so as long as you're
cleaning your brushes regularly and kind
of keeping the drops off your brushes
you shouldn't be getting too many germs
in your shadow and then as you wear away
the top layer of shadow you've got fresh
shadow underneath so I personally feel
like with powder products I don't feel
like I have to worry about germs so much
I mean with liquid products like if I'm
using a mascara i religiously throw in
my mascaras every i'll push it to four
months sometimes if i really love a
mascara but like I've got mascaras in
here that I know are expired but I just
keep them for showing purposes for
review purposes I need to have like just
like a place where I put old mascaras to
just just for show because I've
currently have them in my drawer where I
have my current things that's an idea
but yeah with eyeshadow i don't really
worry about powder products um and
collecting germs and that maybe other
people have better ideas if you do have
an idea about um about germs and powder
products Jen
her bro is her name so at Jennifer bro
to give her some information um and then
Sammy saying that she spray us with
alcohol every so often which is kind of
interesting I know you people use
alcohol to repress I shadow so I would
imagine that wouldn't hurt the quality
at all so Sammy that's really good ideas
stuff she says she prays with a little
bit of rubbing alcohol cool um there you
go nikki says the same thing I guess I
don't know is anybody ever gotten an eye
infection from an from I shadow now i'm
all paranoid man oh my gosh everybody's
saying about spring without going now
I'm thinking like I got by naked tues
like three years old now I feel like I
need to use some alcohol on it YouTube's
keeps buffering Leslie hopefully it
fixes it if KJ says the same thing horse
gotta says to face the black bronze or
smells delish little black bronzer
smells delicious they all smell oh my
gosh all right ninety percent off
alcohol not rubbing alcohol okay nice
Sammy thank you for that let's see Annie
says the tartlet in bloom has shimmer
shadows where the original was just mad
right does it is just mad I know he's
just mad I have it just met someone
where are you where are you i'm gonna
find you I don't know where my Charlie
pehle when I have so much things places
in the morning at two cleanups and now
look really disorganized I'm to spend
some time today organizing this room and
organizing my drawers because they're a
mess right now um yeah they're so
awesome aren't they Jennifer like
everybody the in the community is so
amazing collective brain of makeup
awesomeness Brenda says good morning
really enjoy your videos thank you so
much Brenda I appreciate it let's see
Monica I feel like green is a hard eye
shadow to make it would love to know how
big how makers think about the screens i
use our mega eath wet and wild comfort
collett still hard to see yeah we were
talking about where this is coming from
as we were talking about in the
chocolate bar palette that this green
here turns gray when you put it on the
eyes I find the same thing with a lot of
purples that purples will turn gray when
you start blending them out for the
green I will tell you if you want
greens and purples this is amazing this
is amazing it's got everything you need
in it it is so super fun I don't usually
have as much problem with greens as I do
with purples but I have that problem
with purples really bad turning gray on
me one purple that I really really like
is the the single shadow that I have
from bare minerals and it's there like
plummy purple color it's perfect it does
not turn gray at all green shadows I
don't have that much trouble with opted
like really think about that like as far
as my green shadows and what I think I
do have this here this is a lorac Pro
metal this green is very very nice and
clover it blends out to a green it's
like an army green it's beautiful it's
beautiful this one does not gray out
it's like a metallic army green let's
see go with essence pouch for drugs to
are not Maybelline good to know KJ thank
you for that Nelly any favorite cream
blushes I have like one and I think it's
expired you know cream blushes are not
my favorite formula they're really not I
feel like they're more difficult to work
with you know laying them down on power
on the top of powder products sometimes
can have them the texture kind of turned
weird and i always put on my powder
products before i put on my blush so i
always forget to use them but some
really seller on food washes the bobby
brown formula is very very good this
one's fantastic this is in the shade of
blush rose and there's another one here
another second this is a Make Up For
Ever HD blush this is a really nice one
as well this one is more this ones are
more of it like an oil-based formula let
me show you the difference in formulas
okay so this one is more kind of oily
and this one's more like creamy this one
is in the shade 225 I'll swatch a real
quick for you
but you can see even in the swatches I
mean I did deep swatches you wouldn't
put this much on your cheeks but you can
see like this one is a little bit more a
little easier to work with the Bobby
Brown I feel it blends into the cheek a
little better and I feel like the make
up for ever you kind of have to work
with it you see how creamy that is so I
don't know those are both willing lives
you're looking for cream blushes what I
need to wipe that off I think I use my
last tissue hold on a second so am I
making your likes no I do them they
don't wash it away so I had a whole pack
of makeup wipes I had a whole pack of
tissues and I use them all so we're just
going to deal with it we're gonna deal
with this until the show's over but
those two are probably my favorites also
these parts and causes are not bad but i
definitely recommend you swatch these in
the store before you buy them another
anything else cream blush ones on this
doll 10 one is pretty good you can get
these on QVC these are pretty good I
don't like them as much as the arm to
Bobby Brown spelling my finger these are
also pretty knives these are the Stila
convertible colors these are a lot more
subtle at least this one is this one's
in peony this is the only one I've ever
used this one's a little more subtle
this is of course a smaller size and so
is the Bobby Brown coming up three wash
widescreen flushes that's pretty much it
that's pretty much it for cream blushes
let's see so hopefully that was helpful
to you Nelly Stephanie Jenny met Jen Mac
restocked three of the limited edition
fix buffets and roads lavender and juice
whoa I want to get one of those I'm so
mad that i missed those i saw them in
the store i had my hand on one and i
didn't get it the setting spray the fix
plus setting sprays oh my gosh I'm so
sad about that I'm so sad that I missed
them the road see I'm not into rows
maybe I get the lavender I don't forget
what they use do one smelled like I know
I'm saying that wrong but i forgot with
that smelled like craft lands 62 for the
credits on with para diamonds is breast
cancer that's why i liked art most of
their palates have too many shades i
wouldn't use gotcha okay i have to do
more research on that thank you so much
for that information stephanie says the
NARS cheek color is amazing
the new Steven whatever is lasting
steven blood off its so when the only
blush pals I've bought I'm glad I held
off until this one nice good to know
thank you Stephanie for that information
I appreciate you um let's see let's see
Monica is talking about parabens and how
their hormone disruptors is what she's
thinking they might be that just
parabens are just what make the bubbles
yeah I don't know anything about that
nikki says the Kat Von D shade in life
is amazing it's go two hands down that
was the eyeshadow palette we were
talking about Nelly wants to know have
you gotten use out of the settings
braces less and we talked yes I do try
to use my setting spray more I honestly
forget though I forget to use setting
spray but the setting spray did work on
the kat von d contour palette that I
have that I was poo pooing the kat von d
contour palette because it didn't stay
on my face and of course it all fired
his right now it told you that I'm so
disorganized right now I apologize but
y'all know what it looks like the kat
von d contour palette it definitely
works better with a setting spray so i
feel like it fades without a setting
spray ok let me see everybody says
currently sniffs chocolate bat pellet
again it's wonderful it's wonderful
Nellie says the cocoa bronze heard about
to face or her favorite she's always
tempted to eat them ok scrolling down ok
I'm still crawling down because there's
some great conversation going on Seth
says Alta is having cyber fun days this
friday and saturday looks like deals on
urban decay to face lorac benefit next
nice Steph thanks for that heads up
alright craft lands 64 thanks so much
Jen you were so welcome it's not my
birthday it's Monica's birthday but
happy birthday to Monica and I'm so glad
that I was able to help you that makes
me very very happy Kaylee says hearing
about the green not showing up very well
and blending out helps me learn about
makeup and noticing little things like
that thanks everyone for the awesome
knowledge absolutely Kaylee absolutely
my dear Jennifer says I saw an article
on Jen's makeup appt community about old
makeup and it scared me LOL want to make
sure my stuff is safe yeah definitely
and I
like I don't think much as much
attention to it as I should I really
don't I wish I need to pay more
attention to it the only thing I'm
really a stickler one is mascara I need
to be better about my liquid eyeliners
because I feel like my liquid eyeliners
I don't keep track as well when I've
started using them I feel like that's
the same as mascara that liquid eyeliner
should be gone in three months three or
four months Monica says Joe she's
talking to Jenny on it okay Nelly you
have her a cargo it's always a gamble so
it's either amazing or terrible that's
good to know krista says anyone tried
the bhcosmetics carli bybel palette just
ordered and it looks beautiful it does
look beautiful I hope it's good I really
do because I heard that some of them are
not good the only bh cosmetics palette
that i can vouch for is the UM the
galaxy cheek palette it's got amazing
beautiful colors it's a baked palette
and it's amazing um I did try the it
that's heart one and I did not like that
one at all it was very powdery it was
very oh it was horrible it was
absolutely oh I felt sad so I'm really
hoping the carli bybel pellet is good
really hoping and then crowd craft land
624 says that tot he also thinks that
about cargo that it's hit or miss that's
good to know oh no Marlene videos gone
bad signal Nelly oh no were they using
the microwave for a bit ah oh no
hopefully you guys are back oh no I bet
you they were using the microwave again
okay its back okay good oh my gosh but
you guys lost connection I bet you they
were using a microwave again because
when they use the microwave it kills my
internet so I'll have to tell them that
it's affecting this to it affects my
periscope on the town that it affects
the chat to that they're not allowed to
use a microwave while I'm on chat sorry
about that guys oh my gosh I'm so sorry
about that but it's super blurry if you
change your settings hopefully it's not
worried anymore if you change your
settings that should help go to the
little wheel and bump up the quality
there
now he says I should do a makeup
graveyard like tati I should because I
have a ton of pallets that are in the
graveyard right now then I need to give
better homes I know Kristin Kristin
games got a fabulous channel she's
amazing i watch your channel all the
time we've been friends for how long
Kristin two years something like that so
glad marlena things got better I'm so
sorry about that the V VZW rewards
system worth it I don't know VZW that
acronym is escaping me I don't know what
that is sure the dog my dog my dog's
downstairs um I can't show my dog Nicki
I think the BH and other companies put
more work into the collab shadows the
carli bybel palette is better than the
other shadows that's good to know yeah
okay hold on a second I I lost where I
was one in a second I got to go back up
ah sorry I lost where I was this is nice
just having a nice little chat about
whatever you guys want to talk about
after you guys go after the chat ends
can you do me a favor and come back and
put some requests for four sho topics
down in the comments because I'm
starting to run out of ideas so you guys
are amazing i'm sure that you will come
up with some great ideas for current
topics to talk about so you guys can do
that that will be amazing if you have
ideas for chat topics oh I got to go way
up okay hold on a minute
da-da-da-da-da-da-da alright we've got
about 15 minutes left so if you're
typing in a comment now I may not see it
so if i do miss your comment make sure
that you put it down in the comments
below so oh I just see a comment can you
swatch steel as kitten yes I can hear
steel as um and I'm skipping because I
just happened to run past that one steel
is kitten is top left it's this one here
I'll swatch it it's kind of got a little
bit of a pinky tone to it but it's like
a champagne with a tad bit of pink to it
or peach excuse me peach to it not pink
peach it's very nice very nice it's a
very nice highlight to as far as you
know if you can use it as an eyeshadow
or highlight it's very nice all right
let me keep scrolling up because I
missed a lot of comments oh my goodness
I missed a lot of comments holy moly oh
my goodness there we go got it I'm back
okay have you ever tried the Smashbox
photo finish primer water no one haven't
I have tried their setting spray though
and I do like it now he says how do you
suggest storing makeup it's a mess I
accept full train cases on my desk with
full drawers that's what i've been doing
i got these Alex drawers and make it
awesome then what I find is a little
trays they don't fit things right so I
need to find a better way to store
makeup I wish they made like cloth um
like cloth you know makeup storage
things to put inside drawers but then
they would have some kind of plastic to
protect it so that you could clean it
easily you know what I mean so something
that could stretch a little bit so if a
product doesn't quite fit into an
acrylic organizer it'll stretch a little
bit to hold it but it's still
compartmentalized you know what i mean
so it's got raised edges and
compartments but it's made out of some
kind of like puffy imagine like a puffy
claw you know i don't know how to
describe it like um like it's fabric but
it's like stuffed so it's got a
structure to it but it's not um but it's
it's not so structured that it doesn't
Bend why is my son outside the door
making monster noises no idea okay but
yeah I would really like something like
that to exist but it doesn't i think
train cases is a great idea I mean it's
one of those things where you just have
to work with the number of products that
you have and you have to work with um
you know I don't know like the
organization system that works best for
you I mean the drawers work great for me
but again like I'm constantly like
growing things and drawers I need to
start labeling my drawer so I don't keep
throwing things everywhere
KJ says missed out on the tart blush
palette so I saved money but I'm sad is

you recommend a concealer for super dry
under eyes almost 40 skin more to
brighten than to conceal you're gonna
have to ask my girls my girls collect
your brand of makeup awesomeness and
Raina Treadwell are a I'm sorry rainia
are a aranea are a ni a TR e ad wel L
rainia talk about um super dry under
eyes the only one i think i can
recommend from a farmer getting that i
do not have my under eyes where is it it
seems like it would be good the knicks
dark circle corrector concealer this has
a very oily base to it so and imagine
this will be good for moisturizing it
just got very um it feels very
moisturizing I can't say that it's going
to work or be awesome but this one feels
good so definitely look into this one
and see if you can find reviews on it
for people with dry skin this would be
the only one that I can look at oh well
it's like I'm a baby cream and the wrong
drawer that was so 15 minutes ago 20
minutes ago all right keep scrolling
down we got about 8 minutes left um okay
there's ass watching steelers kitten yay
so many people say it breaks apart but
would it break apart if you travel and
put a cotton swab in the compact i would
imagine if it breaks apart you can just
spray it with alcohol and kind of Pat it
back down mine hasn't broken I've had it
for a good year and mine still doing
pretty well I don't use this code as
much as I should it's an amazing palette
this is the eyes are the window to the
spirit palette it's not absolutely
fabulous mine is doing okay mine's doing
okay
uh let's say 20 window shopping at
Sephora
when you bare minerals best concealer
for years and she loves it it is
phenomenal that was the one I'm talking
about for the concealer question I did
do if you watch this on the replay after
this is over this is the concealer I've
been loving the bare minerals
multitasking SPF 20 concealer and my
shade is summer bisque that I use I did
do a little demo on that earlier in the
chat so i don't know about for dry under
eyes because it's a powder so i'm not
really sure about that but it is a
phenomenal concealer um Jenny says I
would say that she thinks she thinks the
Vizier shadows are very nice for mature
skin that's good to know thank you so
much for that Jenny april says I keep
trying that bareminerals bisque and I
think I'm just too fair hmm Monica says
her mom has oily skin and medium skin
tone nikki says her comments are all
wonky not posting her double posting
stars people can't see it I haven't seen
any double post from you Nikki I think
they're coming through okay I think
that's just an issue with with YouTube
Nellie says she has terrible under-eye
circles causes when we were talking
about um concealers and I was doing the
demo I think this was like half an hour
ago that's the only thing I hate about
this is that I'm so behind in the
comments like maybe I should just let it
roll but then I don't want to miss
anything I don't know why they're
continuing the garden a BB cream I have
no idea jenny says if your eyes are
smoothing young and lifted you probably
don't need them because there are lots
of Shadows that will look great on you
and blend beautifully for less money um
probably don't need what them oh it's
killing me i don't know what them is
steph says I have a sultry I soul to
amuse and use it yesterday a holy I
can't say that word on this channel was
it was a beautiful big and expensive
it's okay you can say it stuff I just
can't um sultry music I don't know what
brand that is what brand is that staff
KJ Abby new bareminerals serum concealer
still you getting used to it maybe need
powder good to know now he says
unfortunately I can't see the difference
because I've bad Wi-Fi is playing it oh
oh when I was doing the demo may be
coming back you'll be able to see it
Violetta says she uses her the bare
mineral summer bisque she's as the
blemish concealer videos blurry for
Stephanie to oh my goodness I'm sorry
guys Bonnie bell makeup we were
looking about the bon bons palette by to
face with the little hearts then it
looks kind of like childish like
Claire's at the mall exactly Annie
that's what I'm talking about yes stuff
I'm with you nikki says I can't stand
the hearts at least make it edgy like
Betsey Johnson hearts yeah there you go
that's smart the hearts are too cutesy a
lot of people are agreeing on that I'm
going to try to scroll down a bit
because I want to get get some more
stuff everyone's agreeing about the
hearts being a little childish classic
makeup collection yes I'm with you okay
Annie says surely obsessed watching
demoed the bon bons palette only one she
said was poopy and hard to work with
very good she says she's digging it
alright cool man alright cool kind then
we're talking about contours and how you
know I thought a warm contour kind of
defeated the purpose of a contour that
was more of a bronzer because I thought
contours were supposed to be for first
creating a shadow and shadows don't have
warm tones Kaylee says maybe it's just
people use bronzer concert you up okay
yeah and Charlene esta Charlene
alexandra has said the same thing about
the contour thing all right I'm going to
scroll down everyone's talking about the
cool and warm contour tones Jenny says
Marlena had a good video on warm and
cool tones explained about the tone of
contour against the tone of your
foundation I think it was a good video
so that's good to know that it probably
explains her logic behind doing a cool
and warm contour all right we only got
four minutes left all right i'm gonna
scroll down past the contour
conversation okay talk about sanitizing
products okay i'm just going to keep
scrolling down until we get to something
else maybe there's some new questions
kristin says the green and the sleek

citrusy kind of set I might have to get
it hug me organizing I'm here under my
wrong channel account be right back okay
well hopefully you made it back um Jenny
hello oh wait Jenny says LOL Jenny
you've been here forever why am I saying
hello to you que hay que Violetta I feel
like setting spray doesn't really do
anything for me I feel like it does
sometimes I don't till I notice it is if
a make up considerably fades over the
day if I use a setting spray usually it
makes it not but if a makeup
already is awesome and doesn't need a
setting spray I don't notice any
different like I don't feel like there's
like a level of it stays more when i use
the setting spray if that makes sense
like it's only the ones that are like
completely gone by the end of the day
I'll still see them a bit so lisa says
that she likes setting spray when she
feels powdery there you go let's say
amber says I think a good primer is more
important than a setting spray I'm
totally with you on that at least for me
personally except for those one thing
these things like the kat von d contour
palette I feel like I need a setting
spray to helen says the chocolate
palette got me stuck on to face shadows
if you're pale even the semi-sweet one
rocks that's good to know DNA says
what's your opinion on supergoop setting
spray I've never used it so I don't know
that one I do like super super group CC
cream though it's very nice that's the
only one I can talk to though let's see
lisa says liquid products should be
tossed after three months three months I
thought it was a year mmm I got some
stuff on a throwaway then three months

makes me sad Lisa makes me very sad yes

violetta says I got the ditch duty time
bh palette from hautelook several months

about that one it looked really deep
though like I would need you need to
have a deep skin tone order for it to be
like amazing um I know the microwave
thing when my family use the microwave
