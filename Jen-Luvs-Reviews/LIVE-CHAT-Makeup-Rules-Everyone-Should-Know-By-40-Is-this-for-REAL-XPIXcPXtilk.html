weird and that is that's what's
happening with you gonna be next week to
accomodate for people that can't make it
to the 10:00 a.m. people that are on the
west coast of the US other places in the
world and also people who are doing
things Sunday mornings on the East Coast
so next week should be should be the
5:00 p.m. ship looking at my calendar so
yeah so it's a lot of people ask me what
time we do this and that's what time
also if you have any questions about
when chat is you can always look at the
very end of what's up and make up which
is the make up new show that's on my
channel that goes live right before this
excuse me I don't know what just
happened there you can look at the very
ends if even if you didn't watch the
whole thing if you look at very last
frame like the very last clip for the
last five seconds of the show it always
tells you when live chat is if it's
cancelled things like that it's also in
the video description so that being said
good morning I came across this crazy
article logiss not crazy you have to
tell me whether it's crazy we're gonna
decide together if it's crazy or not it
says 12 make up rules everyone should
know by age 40 and we're gonna go over
those and we're gonna decide whether
those are legit or not and we're gonna
go through and I'm actually gonna put on
a look while we're doing this I'm gonna
put on a look using the rules and we're
gonna decide whether these things are
real or not I do have a link in the
video description to the article it's in
Business Insider it was written by all
Bria
alabanza and I did do a little digging
on her got to her website she does not
look to be 40 she could be you never
know she does not look to be 40 so I'm
not sure where she acquired this
information whether it is from makeup
artist she it she doesn't cite a source
so I'm hoping she isn't authored I mean
she's she's a writer she does freelance
writing so this seems to be a freelance
writing piece so we'll see what's
happening I and even if you're not quite
40 you can definitely chime in
on what you think but before we do
before we do let's go ahead and say
hello to the collective brain that's the
people that are here in the live chat if
you're watching this on the replay you
are also part of the collective brain
and you can chime in in the comments
down below you can also check out what
the collective brain is saying next to
me you can see the live chat scoring
which is super cool okay so I'm gonna go
away up my friend Nancy is here hello
Nancy hello to you Steph hi Stacie and
Joanne and Linda and American AG girl
and our chat moderator Steph hello to
you as well
brontë Bradshaw is here Karen and Mariah
and Monica and Debbie green in the house
and Michelle and Charlie and Missa and
Monica is here grace and Jamie and
Ashley and Kate Evan and Kristina and
Barbara B Mac is here and rose and tisha
thank you so much for being here if I
didn't say hello to you hello to you
welcome to the live chat I did happen to
scroll by someone says their advice is
do not run with scissors I think that's
fantastic advice I didn't see who that
was so I missed it but uh but yeah
a lot of people are like now you're not
turning 40 sometimes I think that I
miscounted I how could I possibly I'll
be almost turning 40 but I am I am I was
born on June 8th of 1978 I remember I
was in a bar that I wasn't supposed to
be in when I was either 19 or 20 I was
not drinking I was working at a
restaurant and just hanging out with
people I was not drinking for the record
I didn't drink when I was 19 I didn't
drink till I was I think I was 20 was
when I had my first drink but um but
anyway I was talking to the bartender
just little anecdote I was talking to
the bartender and he was playing keno
and he said what's your birthday I'll
plug it in for my keno and I said six
eight 78 and he was looked at me like
and this is I've been there probably 30
times at this point you know cuz we used
to go there after work and he looked at
me and he was like 76 because I wasn't I
wasn't allowed to be in there so yeah
that was awkward
I was very awkward I don't even remember
like what happened after that I don't
think he kicked me out though because I
did
drink like it was illegal for me to be
in there but because I didn't drink and
I wasn't a troublemaker I think he let
me stay anyway and just was like don't
tell anybody so anyway let's go ahead
and get into these rules and they I am
gonna go slightly out of order because
they go slightly out of order there's 12
of them let me make sure I didn't miss
anything having to do with primer oh no
here we go so we're gonna skip all the
way to number 11 it says never skimp on
primer by the time you celebrated 40
birthdays urban war you're likely to
have collected some souvenirs like acne
scars and other random uneven spots and
you may also have dry flaking skin
I do have spot oh well if you count my
freckles as being spots I do have spots
but other than my freckles I don't have
any spots but I had a lot of these
freckles it's my whole life so I don't
know if that has to do with aging at
least that's just for me it says primers
are like the spackle you'd use when
repainting a wall that's what we all
want right is in spackle they create a
smooth base that ensures all makeup
stays put it doesn't crack even though i
think laura geller does have a primer
called spackle primers also have
diminish the appearance of pronounced
wrinkles and fine lines which I do have
wrinkles on my forehead I've been using
drunk elephant skin care though so I do
feel like my wrinkles are like as
minimized as they get right now and I do
some fine lines around my eyes I'm also
getting some fine lines on my face which
is really odd it's a strange thing to
look at your face and see wrinkles
starting to appear on the cheeks and not
in places that naturally you know been
like my forehead I get but like having
wrinkles here is is odd to me just
trying to keep hydrated probably don't
drink enough water it says we're loving
the cooler daydream mineral primer SPF
30 a weightless multitasker that blurs
fine lines minimizes pores while also
protecting sun damage which is also
important at any age and that's one
thing I did not do was get my sunscreen
I need to go grab that real quick
because I am going to be definitely
gonna be outside today hold on just a
second
okay sorry if there was a mic drop I
apologize try to be gentle with that
okay
are we good all right so even if you're
not outside you're supposed to wear
sunscreen I am really bad with that but
I do try if I am going out in the Sun I
do try to put on my sunscreen but your
sunscreen every day all day and that is
definitely a fail on my part I'm very
very bad with that I admit it and part
of it is my stubbornness from the way
that I grew up I'm gonna go ahead and
start with the pregnant PG primer
because I did read somewhere and you I
would love to know your thoughts on this
I read somewhere that it's best to put
on your primer then your sunscreen then
your foundation that's what I heard so
that's what I'm gonna do but uh what was
I gonna say I was gonna love to hear
your your opinion on something and then
I forgot what it was having to do oh
with the order of when you put these
things on but yeah I love this I love
this primer I'm a huge fan of it it does
have a very strong scent so if you don't
like sense you really will not like it
I'm very bad oh I was gonna tell you
about my grandmother so my grandmother
used to tease me about being so pale and
I had this like complex thing where I
hated not having color on my face
because she said tease me and then like
my parents were like I mean they're very
very nice people they they used to I
mean we would lather up in baby oil and
lay out in the Sun because you know in
the summer getting a tan was like a
status symbol you know that you had
enough relaxed time in order to go out
and be in the Sun so have this is the oh
this is the jewel no excuses invisible
sunscreen shell by the way I really like
it because it doesn't leave a white cast
it's a gel so um so yeah so I'm not
having a tan was like taboo like you
always wanted to tan in the summer time
and I'll put more sunscreen down my neck
and everything later well I'm just gonna
focus on my face right now so I think
I'm still
stuck mentally in that mindset of that I
still want to have some colors in my
skin during the summertime you know I
know that we've moved past that as a
society and knowing that sunscreen is
much more important than having a tan I
still it's still stuck in my brain it's
totally still stuck in my brain Michelle
and Michelle she says I remember the
baby oil days grease up and baked
absolutely and this is what we used to
do we would go out with SPF six the
first time we went out because we didn't
want to burn then we would move to four
then we would move you two and then we
would move to baby oil once we got our
base Jim I used to go fake tanning when
I was in like 1819
we had a fake tanning place I would go
to down the street from my parents house
I was all into that and then I stopped
that but yeah so so anyway my point is
is I'm really bad with sunscreen and I
need to just make a mental change on
that so as far as this
don't forget the primer I do agree with
that I do feel like but I think like
everybody should be using some kind of
base if you want to help your makeup
last longer especially if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin definitely
using a moisturizer before you put your
makeup on I think that's really
important an oily skin I feel like at
least the oily skin women and and then
that I watch they they tap it on their
oily spots and it helps them to not be
oily through the day so I do think that
that primer has good use so I agree with
that one I think that that one's a good
one
grace says for me primer protects me
from my makeup I'm a really sensitive
gotcha
well that makes sense Gail says I've
been using a super goop unseen sunscreen
as my primer nice Michelle that's
something I don't do is put sunscreen on
my face I need to start making that a
habit being on almost 38 yeah I mean I
think that everybody should be wearing
sunscreen
I think skin cancer is way way scarier
than not having a tan you know but the
thing is is it's hard to like eye on
it's not going to happen to me you know
all of that it gets in your head but it
does it happens to be my mom has skin
cancer and
so I mean she's has had things removed
and stuff like that she's not like in an
advanced stage of it but she's had
things removed and she has to get you
know lots of checks and things so you
know it's important
Danny says I read somewhere that your
some of your dark circles under your
eyes can get worse if you're not putting
SPF under your eye area that makes sense
that makes perfect sense
ms/ms mims I'm gonna say it wrong Ms mem
miss Starr says what is a good
moisturizer for oily skin I don't have
that off the top of my head since I
don't have only skin but I'm sure
members of the collective brain know so
not just the people in chat but I'm sure
people on the replay will be leaving you
advice as well Monica says the eye pkn
poor apple sunscreen is amazing that's
great to know I like this one because it
doesn't have a strong sunscreen scent
but it um and it seeps in the skin
really nicely it doesn't ever ever have
a white cast because it's a gel all
right moving on let's go to the next
makeup rule and I don't really believe
in make up rules overall I think you
should do what makes you happy but I
mean tips and tricks can definitely help
so we're gonna flip all the way back to
I don't think there's one that has to do
with foundation let's look whoops
actually I went too far there's really
good too I wore m15 yesterday and I
think it's borderline in between the two
they're both very different but they
both look good I left my mirror over
there - goodness gracious Jeb hold on
okay I'm back already trying not to blow
out the mic all right let me flip back
to the chat while I put this on I'm just
gonna set this mirror without she bright
that's not gonna work I don't have a
good setup this morning mah mah mah mah
mah mah mah mah and I'm not gonna put on
a lot of foundation I don't like putting
on a lot of foundation in the summer
time I was mentioning in this video how
I see people putting on you know four
palms of foundation and it's like
what are pumps my gosh it's like that
must feel so heavy to have four pumps of
foundation on but I see it needed videos
all the time so I'm really curious how
many pumps of foundation you use because
for me it's like one or two depending on
how much coverage I want if you do not
see the review of this foundation I do
really like it it definitely has like
the fact that it doesn't have any light
shades like actual true like fair shades
kind of sucks but the form itself
I do like but if you want to see the
wear test and everything you can check
that out in that video all right
see I think that looks nice just as like
one layer you know even my skin tone a
little bit without it looking like I'm
wearing a ton of foundation but I don't
have a ton of discoloration either so I
think that makes a huge difference I
don't have hardly any discolorations I
think that makes a huge difference in
how much foundation that we choose to
use you know all right let me skip down
to the bottom and see how many pumps of
foundation people use one and a half for
Amber half to one pump for Sally Megan
says I use about three ish pumps full
coverage Queen I see people using more
than that Stacy one to two pumps
Kimberly says two to three Laura says I
only use one pump maybe two that's where
I'm at
I usually use two but I think one looks
nice Joe says one and a half so a lot of
us are doing this hi Terri Lee Terri Lee
says start with one yeah Christina two
to three yeah so nobody's saying they
use four pumps like I see on YouTube all
the time iris one Ashley one and a half
Danny - Megan one two - max Jenny one
two - yeah I mean so I'm not going crazy
it's not just me all right so there is
one about concealer there is a tip about
concealer and I believe that is tip
number let's go to it tip number six it
says don't go overboard with under-eye
concealer let's face it as you get older
the skin under your
naturally gets thinner and darker but
that isn't an invitation to start piling
on heavy concealer a thick layer of
under-eye concealer is it really likely
to crack and cake which only draws more
attention to the area to avoid applying
too much use a lightweight formula such
as long combs a face earnest waterproof
under-eye concealer and apply it with a
brush which will help distribute the
color evenly and only put concealer into
the darkest areas that truly need
coverage not be on entire under-eye area
or you risk resembling a raccoon use
home remedies for puffy eyes and dark
circles can help to see this one I'm
kind of torn on because if you look at
my eyes I don't really have dark circles
very much like you can see a little bit
like right there so is what they're
telling me just to put a little bit
right here because I feel like with
concealer I feel like a lot of times
people use concealer as an under eye
brightener as well not just concealing
it I know some people will layer two
different products they'll put a
concealer and then do a brightener I do
agree that too much concealer can
definitely cake especially if you've got
fine lines I mean do you see in some of
the tutorial I'm going back to the
tutorials people they go bam bam bam and
they color it in and then they color in
their forehead and then they color in
their chin and then they're putting
concealer here I mean it's like
everywhere I just stick in the shape
tape don't joke with heart shape tape
which is like the biggest concealer ever
and I'm sitting here thinking like oh my
gosh
oh my gosh how in the world I guess cuz
they're younger like they don't get fine
lines and stuff but I definitely agree
about the caking into fine lines but I
don't think you necessarily just need to
put it in like one place like what I
normally do is I'll put it in a triangle
like this but I don't color it in and
then I blend it out that's just me but I
do think a lot of people on YouTube put
all I couldn't see where I mean it looks
gorgeous on them I just can't do that so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna follow
the tip and I'm just gonna put it right
there just a little bit right there and
by the way I am loving this concealer
this is by color pop it's the no filter
concealer I got light 14
oh my gosh I love it it said to put it
on with a brush but I'm gonna just blend
it with a brush this is Mike what I
normally do oh my reflect typing and all
CAPTCHAs got something very important to
say great tip for maturing skin is not
to do your makeup like young youtubers
I'm 24 and never do my makeup like
youtubers yeah I mean I think that you
have to do what you like on your skin
and I think trying out new things is
important I'm still gonna do the
triangle thing though even though I'm
gonna use a little less I'm still gonna
do a little brightening and then what I
like to do with this particular
concealer is Pat it out with my finger
toes but I actually do like that I
actually do like that as far as the
using less thing which I didn't think
that I would like that but I do because
usually I put I do put a little bit more
but it's definitely I don't need more
than that at least for me and it depends
on your level of under eye circles s but
it's not as brightening down there
either it doesn't look as beauty guru
like you know but I do like it I like it
a lot okay let's see what else is
happening Jenny says I'm 20 and that's
way too much concealer I use a bit near
my skin tone and something sheer too
bright and there you go
Elaine says I need to use a corrector
it's an on option for me my dark circles
are so bad I do use a thinner formula
there you go and I think that everybody
has to decide what's best for them and I
definitely think some people would
prefer to use some kind of corrector
which I don't feel like I need the other
thing is is I feel like a lot of these a
lot of these tips can be used for
anybody it's not just for people with
much more mature skin I mean we've got
people you know 20 24 years old in here
talking about using the same thing just
as a color top concealer oxidize
horribly on me oh no mine does not
that's so weird Stacy I use a small
amount of high pigments and concealer
under my eye and set it with some white
powder don't bake I never bake
I can't bake I can't do it brontë a lot
of youtubers have fillers
sounded a little bit unnatural
down there don't let that go though Jay
Nesta says I don't use under eye
concealer creases every time what makes
sense I mean and and maybe using less of
it might help I don't know Jenny says my
favorite concealer is the Tarte aqua
sealer I have not tried that Kerry says
baking for me at 49 no way Sammy my
color pop concealer oxidizes so bad oh
my gosh why is it mine oxidizing like
mine mine does not do that here we're
gonna let one swatch dry and we're gonna
test this concealer I'm gonna just
swatch it on my hand we're gonna leave
it there we're gonna let it sit for a
little while and then I'll but I've put
a fresh swatch next to it and we'll
compare because I need to know this I
need to know this alright let's go to
the next makeup rule the next nekkid
rule is one that I definitely do not
agree with and I might have to break it
but we'll see what you all think say yes
the foundation no.2 powder this is the
first tip as you get older your skin
tends to thin and develop fine lines in
your makeup routine needs to change to
accommodate those nuances the first
order of business is to tops out power
which reliably makes you look older
powder adds way too much texture it
looks cakey and takes a life out of your
skin skin is alive and she'll abdui and
touchable says Cindy Joseph a makeup
artist turned supermodel who founded the
makeup line boom that's the one that's
targeted toward women embracing their
their aging if you feel you must use
foundation don't put powder over it wait
for it to dry and dab moisturizer over
it says Joseph I don't think I'm gonna
be dabbing moisturizer over my face I
don't think that I can take it I already
feel very moisturized I don't think I'm
going to do that but I will be skipping
powder today due to this tip and it
continues and it has a great lightweight
option for smooth coverage is Laura
Mercier's tinted moisturizer after
applying it evenly over your face press
a makeup sponge into any wrinkled areas
where makeup may have settled in and
make sure to choose the right foundation
the color should match or is even before
it's blended see now I'm thinking I
should probably try it I don't know this
just seems like it's too much like I
don't want all that on my face I already
have found the IOD of primer I always
already
found skin sunscreen I already have
Foundation and then to put a moisturizer
over top of it I don't I don't and also
I'm not trying to look glowing to the
gods like with the shiny face I really
don't agree with that one honestly yeah
mayor says don't do it I don't think I
should either Blue Ivy says I do powder
under my under my foundation at my
t-zone okay that's interesting it Karen
says nope nope nope
cherish Etta says I should try it Jen
says I have to use powder I'm oily but
it's about finding Goodwin and using a
light layer I mean I do admit that
sometimes I don't use a powder all over
my face but I always set my concealer so
maybe I don't know but I think using
less concealer and then using a Pat look
I feel really weird not setting my face
like I feel like uh like it's not right
Jessie says I feel like this tip was
relevant five or more years ago but in
the last few years too loose setting
powder game has changed and changed a
lot and there's so many non cakey
options there I a hundred percent agree
with that I am so waiting Jessie I just
thought someone before it disappeared my
skin is crying hearing this I might I'm
crying too right now I don't agree with
this one I don't think I'm gonna do the
moistures I think because I do have to
wear this all day today and I'm gonna be
down at my nephews baseball game and I
don't think I can have moisturizer all
over my face on top of this and I'm
sweating I uh I need to be comfortable
today but if I try it I will leave some
info in the description and if you try
it let me know what you think about it
American AG girl says I feel like my
treasure her foundation would take away
coverage I agree I totally agree Gina I
only use powder where I'm going to use
powder products that's interesting Yael
says Jackie aina uses powder under
foundation see I feel like powder under
foundation would like make the powder
ball up though doesn't it make the
powder like get all goopy underneath the
foundation that just seems weird Megan
says wait moisturizer over foundation
are they on drugs I don't know that's
what that that's what they say is boom
person says it so I'm just gonna let
that I'm gonna just going to let it go
at this I'm gonna
let it go alright let's see what's next
I don't oh here we go this one avoid
sparkles this is tip number seven I'm
skipping around because I am putting on
a full face alright actually then we'll
check the concealer after we read this
one sparkles that set in two wrinkles
are not a glamorous look sparkles are
especially aging on the eyelids because
they magnify and bring attention to
every fine line if you're feeling
festive and really wants to glam it up
limit sparkly shadow to the inner corner
of your eyes and the center of your lids
by now you also want to stop believing
those popular makeup myths which is
another article that they link us to on
that thirteen makeup myths you should
really stop believing and the first one
is your concealer should be lighter than
your skin tone well maybe we'll read
these afterward because I don't know
about that I do like my concealer
lighter than my skin tone so maybe we'll
go back to that because I'll know about
mmm I don't like this one at all
sparkles on aging eyelids magnify and
bring attention to every fine line I
think that it depends on your own
personal eyelids and I think it depends
on what you're comfortable with I
personally love sparkle and shine on my
lids but I also don't have a lot of
wrinkles I don't have a lot of any
clothes in the eyes I'll come in real
close so you can see see I don't have a
lot going on there is I do have some
fine lines don't know if you can see
them aren't here but it's not like a lot
so I'm definitely all about the shine
and sparkles because that means no
highlighter either I don't know
thank ya here we go rare feat absolutely
she said I'll be rockin I'll be eighty
rocket on glitter brow they can fight me
I am video and Sarah says I will Sparkle
till I die
Stacey you know I love my Sparkle and
hot light I am with you even says even
curiouser glitter is my favorite color
I'm with you Jen I hate super light
concealer it never looks right yes super
light doesn't look right but you're from
what I understand you can see they're
supposed to be like a shade lighter not
a lot lighter but like a shade lighter
like mine it's just a little bit lighter
by the way speaking of concealer let's
check and see if they're cut there's a
color difference there ohh-ho-ho you're
right look look at the difference this
is the freshly applying and this is the
dry there is quite a difference but I
guess because I chose lighter I chose a
little bit lighter look it doesn't
really make a difference that's why I
didn't notice it's already oxidizing
it's already changing Wow well that goes
to show if you order this concealer you
should probably order a shade lighter
than what you expected to use because it
is oxidizing totally but I mean
oxidizing isn't necessarily a bad thing
it's just something you have to just
means exposed to air it doesn't mean
it's gone bad it doesn't mean that it's
something bad you just have to take it
that into consideration when you're
picking your shade that you want to go a
little bit lighter because it is going
to darken up a bit on your skin wow you
guys are amazing I didn't even notice I
love you Kara I'm giving you a hug oh
thank you don't look down my shirt
you creepers not you creeper but the
creeper that's watching that I didn't
know was watching okay
but the creeper that's hiding in the
shadows the know where all the sparkles
I want to know right I love my eyes
sparkles yes Jeana says I just
discovered color pops super shot glitter
shadows nice Shirley oh hell no I want
to spar God darn it I'm going to I agree
and I think that it has to do with your
comfort zone you know and what you want
to do one thing oh you know what I
didn't do yet
Brow's does it have anything about brows
I think it might you see because I need
you my brows my brows are looking
Haggard right now that one's lips blush
eyeliner lip stick concealer sparkles oh
there there is a brow one okay
well we'll do we'll hold off on the
shadow for a second but we're gonna do
an all matte look today with a little
bit of glitter in the corner just cuz
they said to but we'll talk a little bit
about brows real quick before we do that
always fill in sparse brows this is tip
number eight eyebrows become thinner due
to natural hair loss as you age so
filling in sparse sections is an
absolute must
brow should always be kept defied well
shaped and fairly full as this looks
youthful and healthy according to Joseph
Plus eyebrows frame your face so without
a nice full shape your face is like
little look heavier rounder and wider
we've gotten great with some results
with the L'Oreal Paris brow stylist prep
and shape Pro kit which comes with
pigment and wax setting powder miniature
tweezers and an angled brush and spoolie
I do agree with this I do feel like
everybody at any age if you want to
enhance your face the filling in brows I
think is a good idea because I feel like
you know what she's saying you know your
brows do shape your face I remember when
I was teaching our librarian she had
blonde hair and you couldn't see her
eyebrows it would almost look like she
had no eyebrows and I mentioned to her
one day have you ever thought about
using just a brow pencil on your brows
cuz you're just talking about makeup or
whatever just having a general
conversation and we were just talking
about her different makeup habits I said
you know do if you thought about it and
she was like yeah I've thought about it
but you don't really know how to do it
and I was like talking her about you
know just using a very very light one
and just filling in where she naturally
has hair but you just can't see it she
came in a few days later with her brows
done and she got so many compliments
because you could actually see her brows
you know and she didn't very lately she
did a really nice job with it and she
was like thank you Jim like she was so
excited and I miss her so much her name
is Colleen and she's so nice and I miss
her but uh but yeah she it made such a
difference it made such a difference
like I said my coffee real quick because
I'm fired
I do apologize for the sipping noises I
did not mean to do that I apologize I
know that really bothers some people did
not mean to do that that was totally an
accident I was just I thought the coffee
was higher it was accident all right
today we're gonna use the toothpaste
chocolate brownie brow pencil this one
is not anything overly stellar but it
works great I'm finding with brow
pencils that I really like a lot of them
and it doesn't really matter which one I
grab for they can all be used
interchangeably I don't find that one
performs better than another I'm just
gonna put on a little bit of brows today
because I'm just hanging out with my
family today so let me skip down I want
to see what everybody's saying about
this brow business brandy I'm familiar
with the product line boom line with the
boom line the expert from this lot
wait I'm familiar with the product line
boom the expert from this is the creator
my mother has most of their products
they're super hydrating nice Michelle
says I'm a victim of the thinner the
brow better generation yes yes and you
over tweeze Tom you're not alone you're
not alone two little angel wings
Michelle dalum I don't think oh she's
time I don't think I did my makeup with
a little sparkle she's talking to
somebody else
hi Celeste she says I forgot my brow
pencil when I was at our camper this
weekend and I it killed me going to work
without my brows filled in oh my gosh
yeah I I seriously like I can't I used
to not be able to fill in my brows but I
definitely agree that I feel like my
brows have gotten sparse or as I've
gotten older it's far sure a word no
more sparse is where I was gonna go and
I'm just doing a little bit of brows
today we're not gonna go crazy oh my
gosh I got the Kat Von D I shot a brow
pen brow pomade oh my gosh that stuff is
intense that's intense
like it's too much for me I can't even
with that stuff like I if it was
convenient for me to return it I would
so return it it is just it's too much I
don't like it at all
that's gonna be my favorites and fails
this month I will tell you that it is
it's too much it's like paint it's like
thick paint and I just can't with that
I'm sure some people would be able to
make some beautiful artistic looks with
it mm all right but speaking of Kat Von
D I do have the 10th anniversary palette
we're gonna play with this today and
we're just gonna do a matte look and
then put a little sparkle I think I'm
gonna do maybe we'll do hmm I need
something more natural today because
again I'm hanging out with my family so
I don't want to look all glam craziness
so we're just going a baseball game and
hanging out of my brother's house so
let's do a little bit of this guy we're
gonna try to try to zip through this eye
look though because I don't oh I forgot
my primer time out time out I don't want
to spend a lot of time doing my eyes I
wish I could like pause do my eyes and
come back look if this were an edited
video Laura says I was only 13 mascara
and concealer is that what your first
thing was that you did was mascara and
concealer this is Urban Decay's Eden by
the way I love this eyeshadow primer
close-up of the palette I will show you
a close-up of the palette I will do that
let me just blend in my concealer here I
mean a concealer my primer real quick
and I will show you close-up I do plan
to do a full review I have the Laura Lee
Los Angeles nudie patootie coming up
next and then I'm hoping that that this
will be my next palette review I'm
hoping uh Michelle yes or no the Kat Von
D 10th anniversary I don't know yet
but it's definitely different than I
expected let me see if I can get it not
to look blown out let's say let's put
this there we go and now it's not
getting those bright lights but yeah I'm
kind of on the fence right now I'm kind
of on the fence a little bit I'm just
gonna try to zip through and I look real
quick I'm not gonna spend a lot of time
doing anything magical I just want a
matte look just going into like the
cream shade that's on the bottom I'm
just gonna throw that in cuz I don't
want to bore you with this part one
thing I don't like is they don't have
the names on here you have to flip over
to find the names and that's annoying so
I just put that one in my crease and
then we'll do a little bit of hmm let's
go with this guy and kind of deepen up
the crease with this color that might be
fun it's like a good olive green it's
kind of fun I'm just gonna slap this on
because I really don't want to spend a
lot of time on this right now because I
want to get back to the tips oh my
mirror everybody always asked about the
mirror I thank you so much for hey
latina hey Julio yeah I everyone asked
me that it is I get it got Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond as the best place to get that
mirror cuz its pricey because you can
use your 20% off coupon but it's really
good it's a great mirror I'm very
thankful to have it alright and then I'm
just gonna pop a color on my lid we're
just gonna do like a two-minute eye look
here let's do let's just do this cream
shade all over the lid and we're gonna
leave it at that
I'm just gonna bomp bomp mom I need a
brush I was gonna try to do it with my
finger and be all gangster like that but
no I can't
I feel like I'm getting ready for work
when I was getting ready for work some
days I would do my makeup and like I was
like five minute makeup challenge kind
of thing and then we're gonna do a
little bit let's do a little bit of gold
sparkle in the inner corner just for fun
cuz that's where she says I can place
that she says I can't put it anywhere
else so we'll do a little gold I will
say one thing about this palette is that
the the the mats are really really good
it's the shimmer is that I'm a little
bit off with there we go we're done
that's the eye look that's what we're
going with today me and Dawn Monica just
ordered a new dose of color shadows nice
nice
Oh mister Ashton's mad at Sephora for
showing stock availability on the 8th
and JCPenney stores for that kat von d
palette and they've been telling me I
could not buy it until those 21st big
issue others got it in different
JCPenney Sephora stores oh gosh well I
hate it when they do that I ordered it
from the Kat Von D website I'm sure I
got mine alright let's go to the next
one let's do the eyeliner one because
this one is like stop applying eyeliner
to your low lashes lining your bottom
lids can make your eyes appear smaller
drag down and overall older the eyes
already start drooping with age so you
don't want to accentuate this process
with lines beneath your eyes joseph
recommends lining only your upper lid
and not too thickly to open up and
brighten your eyes if you must apply
islands your lower lashes stick to the
outer corners and make sure the top and
bottom lines connect okay so I kind of
agree with this one in that I personally
very rarely will go all the way across I
do feel like it makes my eyes look
smaller I don't like the way that it
looks when it's all they crossed but
I've been doing that forever
like since as long as I can remember the
last time I lined my whole lower
waterline was like 1993 like it just
looks I mean I think I might have done
in a couple of videos just trying to do
something different but it's definitely
not my comfort zone I don't really like
the way that it looks on me but it looks
beautiful on other people so I think
this one really depends on your eye
shape I don't think that it's
necessarily an age thing
I think it's an eye shape thing but I do
have friends that are a little older
than me and one of them she she does do
all the way across I'm trying to get her
to break the habit of that because she
has very small eyes and I feel like it
makes your eyes look even smaller so
I've talked to her about that because I
did her makeup once because her makeup
artist didn't show up so I ended up
having to take over which was kind of
interesting and fun so so yeah so I
ended up doing her makeup and we talked
about that but because I do I do think
if you have small eyes I feel like it
makes your eyes look smaller when you
use lower lash line all the way across
Kat says I never go all the way across
the bottom either Jen like you said it
makes eyes look smaller yeah and that's
the way I do usually I'll do a little
bit of black like right here like
literally that much not hardly anything
six crowns and angels weeping I use a
brown line or smudged on the lower lash
line there you go and something a little
bit a little bit less you know it makes
it less harsh when it's brown Monica I
never use a line on my lower lash line I
can just smoke it out with shadow yeah
and I think they're even talking about
shadow though I think they're talking
about shadow as well Michelle it's just
saying no to racoon eyeliner I'm with
you I'd say Jen I'm small eyes but my
eyes look very slanting squinty without
it I have to do it all the way around to
make my eyes look larger interesting
very interesting Jenny sometimes small
arises is the intention with that much
eyeliner yes that's a good point that's
a good point yeah like I'm saying it's
the same thing like I feel like it has
to do with your eye shape
Winona says sound like whoever wrote
this just wants everyone over 30 to just
dry up and go away I don't know maybe I
don't know I don't know her but I am
gonna use this Kat Von D liner and
trooper because I like it a lot I just
bought the anniversary one because I
hadn't used this liner in a little while
and I do still really really like it I
know I think I'm have to go over here
because I can't hold the mirror and do
this at the same time SIA Paula
I'm not doing this on camera Oh who's
texting me hi my brother okay
I just put it I'm not gonna do a wing
today he's my brother
yes it's my brother oh no my nephews
games been canceled because the fields
are too wet oh what a bummer that's such
a bummer well hopefully we'll still get
to hang out with him okay but we're not
gonna do anything on the lower lashline
usually I do do some color on the lower
lash and we're not going to do that
today because apparently I'm not
supposed to be because I'm getting too
old for that Connie says I've only ever
put colored liners on preference you
hear about contouring this and
contouring that and I hate contouring on
me so I skip it like contouring on my
nose I went to a Sephora class
contouring and we talked about
contouring my nose and we basically
everybody agreed that I should
so I do think that the the lower lash
line thing is a personal preference
thing I don't think it has anything to
do with age I think it has to do another
shape I don't I don't know if that one
really belongs in this particular
article but that's just my opinion
okay so let's see what else I what we
haven't talked about okay we got lips
blush we might do the blush one next I
don't want to miss any oh you know we
didn't read this one tip number nine
find the right brow pencil color when
filling in brows don't just grab a
random Brown that seems neutral enough
or you risk looking like a grainy a
granny cartoon with black sharpie marker
brows that's what the Kat Von D will do
to the new guy Kat Von D brow pomade it
will make you look like sharper marquee
sharper marquee sharpie marker pronounce
the fact is that your eyebrow color
gradually fades to gray white or so fair
that the brows are practically invisible
so it's imperative that you choose this
pencil color that matches joseph
recommends going with a brow pencil or
gel with brown undertones we love
anasazi Beverly Hills perfect brow
pencil which comes in eight shades I
think that you need to do what you like
with this one I do try to match my my
brow color to my hair color to my brow
pencil like let me show you me click
back over so I can see what I'm doing
here see how it's like it's very similar
colored but one thing I do like to do
sometimes is I'll use a slightly lighter
one in the inner corner and then use
this one like further down and just use
a lighter one because I just like the
way that that looks but that's more of
like an effect thing I think in general
I think you can't go wrong with matching
your brow hair color you can't go wrong
with that
but I don't see anything wrong with
experiments and with other colors that's
my opinion I again I don't think that
has anything to do with age
I don't Bobby says these rules are nuts
I agree with Bobby he says no pink brows
I think if you want pink brows I think
you should have pink brows I'm totally
with you Michelle says darn sharpie
marker brows are cheaper than micro
bleeding Danny I'm 37
and I found a gray hair my brows
yesterday devastated it happens
girlfriend it happens
Naomi the only opinion I have about brow
color is that reddish Browns look pretty
stamped on unless your hair is naturally
red yeah they can I that's a really good
point Naomi Sally I feel like this hour
goes so quick on watching live thanks
Jen love watching this life if you want
enjoying my morning coffee HP oh thank
you yeah I know we only have 15 minutes
left can you believe it
all right let's do okay let's see what
else I'm missing make sure didn't miss
any other rules but yeah I'm all about
matching your brow color I think that's
just a general thing for everybody you
know okay so let's go back to the blush
one because we're about okay apply blush
in places it occurs naturally many women
apply dark blush or bronzer beneath
their cheekbones in hopes of slimming
their face who does that who applies a
dark blush draping
does anybody here drape that's what
that's called as draping when you apply
blush as a contour who does that I don't
know does that add bronzer I can see
like for contouring but not bronzer I've
got any talk about contouring I don't
know this lady I don't know what's her
name again
Aubrey I don't know what you're talking
about operating however this attempt at
contouring often ends up looking dull
muddy and unnatural instead user blush
instead blush should match your natural
flesh and you should apply it in places
where it would naturally appear not in a
line down your cheekbone or highly
concentrated on to the apples of your
cheeks so you're not supposed to do it
in a line but you're not supposed to do
it here well where are you supposed to
put it then like I don't know I don't
look at myself in the mirror when I'm
like flushed you know I don't know it
says women blush when they're happy so
place your blush where you would
naturally get color when you're having a
good time do you get color in your
cheeks when you're having a good time I
don't I don't I don't do that at least
that I know of Joseph says that would be
where the capillaries are close to the
surface meaning your lips cheeks and
outer outer eye crease area upper
forehead
neck your upper forehead turns pink I've
seen people's necks turn pink but upper
forehead that's interesting the choose
the right shade of blush pinch your
cheeks and pay attention to the color
that emerges see but now I'm wearing
foundation you should fill eyes I'm not
able to see my color that's the shade
you're trying to match Joseph recommends
the boom stick color multitasking stick
a share universal moist moist Universal
color that mimics the shade of our
natural flush okay well hmm
okay I'm curious to see what people are
saying about this Nicky says I've
redness on my cheeks that's where I
place my blush where Maritsa says apply
blush whatever blush is left on the
brush to my forehead in my nose really
interesting Laura says depends what what
kind of good time
Oh kinds of what kind of good time LAN
di get flushed after two glasses of wine
ah it's me no I get flushed when I'm mad
and sweating I get mad I mean not when I
get mad but when I'm when I'm outside
sweating like I see when I come in but I
look at myself that much my father
doesn't look at myself like I don't know
okay but anyway let's let me pinch can
we see my color I might give myself a
bruise trying to see what my color is I
don't know I've got some blushes here
though I kind of feel like like this
color it is like a good color for me
I've always felt like this color this is
everyday minerals and Girl Friday no one
talks about everyday minerals anymore
this blush is probably five years old
and I can't throw it away
because I really like the color is
everyday minerals even still around I
don't even know I have to google it now
I used to be obsessed with it stuff yeah
they're still around I can't believe it
they are still around wow I haven't
heard about them and forever but yeah I
like this color called Girl Friday let
me see what else I have it's similar
this one is good this one is
I must have gotten this in the
subscription box luminous loose blush I
don't know what color this is studio
makeup I must have gotten this in a
subscription box but that one looks
pretty good
what else do I have this one a
love-struck this is a lovestruck blush
by Jake at beauty and this is in sweet
pea pink no no I have to pinch again I'm
bruised myself pinch pinch pinch we live
in Maryland and we have these crab
shirts and they say I pinch it's got a
little crab on it
that's what reminds me of but yeah
that'll work let's see what's this this
is charts ecstatic no one might be a
little too peach so are they saying I
can't use any of these other blushes
like this is too pink I think oh no this
is Argyle by the balm I don't know but
what if your cheeks don't turn pink what
if your skin tone doesn't allow for your
cheeks to turn pink then what do you do
I don't know I mean I guess everybody
kind of turns a little bit pink I don't
know my favorite blushes Katrina are
these the insane blushes by the balm in
my favorites
yeah mama bear my no turn pink yeah I
mean like what do you do do you is this
only for people that that their cheeks
turn yeah pretty magnify my cheeks never
get pink I don't use blush no peachy
bright no pink shoe break capillaries
tap those like stop pinching your cheek
I know I need to stop now you have a
pink cheek I know okay so maybe I should
just pick one let's just go with the in
stain because I really like this like
that's the same color ish I don't know I
kind of like this one this one's kind of
fun I think I'm gonna use this one I
think this one is like the perfect my my
cheeks color now as far as application
yeah I don't think that everybody's
cheeks turned pink
I don't know sorry hey maybe to Live
Love from Scotland love and
love to Scotland I think Rosie said I
would Bruce if I pinch my cheek okay but
this color is really pretty I like this
color where's my blush brush we'll just
use this one this is from that Laura Lee
Murphy set they're my favorite that my
favorite my first morphe brush set this
is the r14 and I'll tell you I like some
of them better than others some of them
I do not like and some of them I really
like now as far as where I would
naturally blush I would imagine like
here like that I guess I'll blend it in
a second I shouldn't put too much
product on but I feel like you know with
blushes a lot of times I like to do
blush that kind of matches my eye look
you know like if I'm wearing a peachy or
I look I like to use a peachy or blush
that's just me though I don't know but I
agree you know we shouldn't be striping
it up our faces and leaving a big stripe
you got to blend blend
mama bear I bronze first and then just
add kind of a sweep of blush where I
want I have a huge smile so my cheeks go
up to my eye so I'm fine with that nice
very cool very cool all right so we're
just gonna do a little bit of that and I
feel like we're good cuz again I'm not
trying to do all clown face
we won't go all the way back usually I
kind of go all the way back but we won't
do that today because Audrey says I
shouldn't so we won't all right I feel
really weird not having any powder on
maybe because it's so hot in here I
think my husband turned off the air
conditioning and open the doors
cuz he's an outdoor guy so he likes to
like let in all of that nature into the
house that's like it so hot Naomi says
okay but your look so far as naturally
pretty
thank you so much Naomi appreciate that
mr. Ashdown Smashbox blush brush nice I
don't often look at that rachel says
blush brush picks I love my motor
brushes honestly my modem I Luxy brush
is Sigma has really good brushes I have
tons of brushes they're like all over
the place actually I have a thing of
these are all clean brushes some of my
favorites in here I'll try to pull some
out this one's not good this one's good
this is from the luck see Jasmine set
but they it's the same brush it's just
different just a different design this
is the 5:22 I loved
kind of all that's in here right now
that I'm like this one's good this is
from Real Techniques this is the one of
their fancy schmancy so it's their blush
brush this is number 300 I really like
this one too but this one's more dense
so this one's really good for blushes
that are less pigmented that build I
really like that these kinds of shapes
or my favorites alright we are running
out of time so let's make sure we get to
the rest of things I'd only there's
anything in here on mascara so I'm just
gonna throw on some mascara we're gonna
do the collab today collab this is a
high rise and same length mascara we're
gonna oh this is the one with the wand I
don't like but it's a nice mascara I
really like the collab mascaras I'm just
gonna pop a little bit of that on while
we're here Oh getting hair my eyeball
why she saw me put a mascara is like
watching paint dry it's most boring
thing ever so I have to make sound
effects to make it more interesting
okay almost there I'm airing because I'm
going back and forth trying to get this
not to clump in my lashes okay I'm just
gonna put a little mascara on I'm not
too worried about you know super
voluminous lashes today okay let's go
back to the tips I think we have just a
couple more couple more let's see okay
oops not there make sure we got
everything so number one was the no
powder and then we're going on to lips I
think lips is kind of all we have left
there's two lip tips okay let's talk
about the highlighter one it's tip
number ten use a pearly not a frosty
highlighter stay far away from frosty or
iridescent highlighter shades as these
light reflecting effects actually
accentuate fine lines and creases they
also care highly unnatural and painted
on just sitting on
top the skin instead of blending into it
for highlight and radiance avoid frost
and use creamy pearl essence instead
Joseph says boomstick is this all is
this like a an ad for boom I think it is
boom sip glimmer is great for this
Joseph also says a multitasking
highlighting section go beyond your
upper cheekbones and onto your eyelids
brow bone cheekbones and even shoulders
clavicles and more okay well I did not
grab out any highlighters let me grab
because I thought it said no
highlighters because I went for the no
shimmery thing going on let's see okay
this one this will work okay so this is
essence is pure nude and this is number
10 be my highlight this is a really nice
pearly highlighter it's very very pretty
and I do not agree with this I think
that you should wear whatever
highlighter it makes you happy and I
don't feel like a lot of us over 40 have
wrinkly cheeks so I don't think that
it's that big of a deal I don't think
it's gonna accentuate like I feel like
wrinkly here is someone that's much
older I'm not I'm not opposed to like
like big bright highlights on people
that are 40 and older that's just me all
now sexy rad radix Roger okay I think we
got it right I prefer shimmery blush to
look do me than a texture infusing
highlighter I'm a younger guy in makeup
can be a useful tip for older gals okay
nice so shimmery blush to look dewy then
a texture infusing highlighter so
instead doing a highlighter a shimmery
blush instead okay see I don't like
doing the shimmer here I like to keep my
shimmer here but I think it has to do
with face shape too
you know I mean it just kind of just
depends on what you like the way that it
looks on your face you know Michelle now
now what if we like a painted on look I
like my mask thank you I'm with you six
crowds and angels weeping hourglass
ambient blush yes the original one is
really good for that pearl look where I
feel like there was a go
that was more intensive is in the silver
packaging that one is more intense a
mantra 87 if you apply a blush and
highlighter under a pigmented finishing
powder it doesn't do that that makes
sense because the finishing powder would
kind of dull it down a little bit that
makes sense it makes perfect sense Jenny
says but I love the charred exposed
highlighters so pretty and gloss and
looking on the skin and I personally I
think that this the that Audrey may not
have access to all of the things that
we've tried I think that this is an ad
for boom that's what it seems like that
anti 8 what not anti-aging but it's like
a celebrate your aging skincare line see
that shine it's so pretty but it's not
overpowering and this is essence man
it's so good what is this like 4 bucks
or something it's really nice but it
definitely like it just looks like it
sets into the skin you know it's really
really pretty but honestly I feel like
there's definitely ways that anybody can
wear a highlight that is poppin and have
it look really good you know like
putting the powder overtop of it to kind
of make it melt into the skin better I
just like there's strategies and things
that might counteract some of these tips
because I don't even know about these
some of these tips all right it is one
hour in and we haven't done lips yet so
maybe we can do this this next one which
was the makeup mist maybe we'll do this
one next week thirteen makeup myths you
should really stop believing I think
that'll be a good one to do next week so
free so as far as the pearly not frosty
highlighter I don't agree but I think
you need to do what it's what's in your
comfort zone and I do feel like some
frosty highlighters do set on top of the
skin I do feel like iridescent
highlighters can sometimes look a little
odd depending on your skin tone but I
feel like like especially the deeper
skin tones I think an iridescent
highlighter can really like cause make
like a really unique cool look feel like
on my skin tone sometimes it looks a
little sickly depending on the undertone
like if it's like a green or undertone
or a blue or undertone it looks a little
weird but on a like a deeper skin tone
it looks gorgeous
so you get
do you and what you like and what works
for your skin tone but I'm definitely
not opposed to frosty highlighters on
anybody it doesn't matter the age I can
see what they're saying as far as
accentuating wrinkles and things but
gotta do you man you gotta do you okay
and then we're just going to do the lip
ones and then we'll be done so we've got
two of them never let your lipstick
migrate this is tip number five your
natural lip line would begin to fade as
you age which makes your lipstick more
apt to bleed and feather yet another
reason to wait you know what maybe the
other one first because it's talking
about dark colored lipsticks okay
this is tip number two and then we'll go
back to that equal number five tip
number two know which colors work best
for your skin tone as you age you
naturally lose definition in your lip so
you want to avoid dark colors like deep
reds purples and browns which makes your
pout look even smaller less highlighted
and less plump choose a color that
blends into your skin tone color palate
Josa suggests so are you telling me
Joseph that a dark lip color is not
going to blend into people's skin tones
do we remember that there are people
with dark skin tones let us remember
this is like huge pet peeve for me a
huge pet peeve I hate this I hate this
right now you get where I'm saying like
I am just it makes me like it's like
it's like a pet peeve it's not like it's
the end of the world but it's like very
inconsiderate in my opinion you can find
the best shoe for yourself if you look
at the color tone of your lips tongue
and gums pink mauve salmon let your
natural palate guide you to the right
colors but some people's lips tongue and
bone you get what I'm saying
I'm not gonna we're looking forward to
the January release of Maybelline Color
sensational NT into matte nudes Oh like
intimate intimate nudes a collection of
creamy matte lip ease and ten warm
neutrals with added honey nectar oils
keep lips hydrated okay so we're gonna
follow the tip but I do feel like a nice
dark lip can look gorgeous on an older
woman I do I think it's just
on the tone Shauna says yes but Jen no
one has red skin I know I know but I
think what I'm talking about is like
women with deeper skin tones their lips
are deeper so that is gonna give them a
naturally deeper color so I'm saying
Monica says that's such crap
Apoc can easily use dark colors I think
everybody can use dark colors I think it
depends on the shade you know I feel
like that there are some shades like
some of these berry Pink's make me look
older I don't like the way a berry pink
looks on me most of the time I prefer
shades like I brought out a couple these
are some of my favorites so depending on
what I'm wearing so for example like
this one
that of course is OCC and it kills me
I've been wearing this a lot lately this
is their lip tar in - I love
I'm communion see my Gong it's the same
color as my gums so this one's a good
one for me I guess this one's really
good too this one is in dusty orchid
shame of course I love shimmery gum but
your solar but then I also love to like
delve into like paint chocolate by Too
Faced see how this is darker but I love
the way this lipstick looks on me I love
it so I mean I think you should do you I
think you should do what makes you
comfortable and definitely look at
yourself and like think about is this
going to make me look a way that I don't
want to look Marissa says hello I
thought we were supposed to check our
nipples I'm not going to show you my
nipples but he's also match but I won't
show you all spare you on that way pink
chocolates when my face too sherry says
oh my gosh alone no one but I mean I
just I feel like you should do what
makes you happy I think that anybody of
any age can wear darker colors I think
red like you're saying reds and purples
and things like that can look beautiful
on people of any age you know but we're
gonna go I just wear this yesterday I
want something a little more comfortable
so let's go with a dusty dusty orchid
shimmer from julep it's the if it's foam
lip crayon cuz I want something really
comfortable to it even though I do love
the occ one no that's kind of pink huh
oh no looks good
what's killing me is not having anything
down here on my lower lashline I don't
like that very much well this is a
pretty and it's super comfortable it's
got this like moisturizing core thing in
there which I really love these are so
comfy it's really good they feel like
lip balms but yeah so that is the
finished look Oh lead and feather you
had another reason to avoid dark colored
lipstick I do think dark colored
lipstick does tend to lead on me more
than others that's just me to avoid this
unfortunate makeup migration be sure to
trace your lips with a clear lip liner
or one the same colors your natural lips
this will create a barrier between your
lips and the surrounding fine lines
helping the color stay put mallies Mally
beauty's lip fence is a great option for
keeping lipsticks squarely on your
kisser check out other the other
inexpensive beauty tricks only stylus
know and then they link to another
article I do think lip liners are great
first let's see if I can find them
quickly okay this one right here is by
Lord and berry it's called silhouette
and it looks like this this one I think
I got in a subscription box but it's
just clear I have that one and then I
believe I have one by NYX somewhere I
thought it was in here but now I don't
see it I thought they were all together
but that's the one that I reach for when
I do do a clear lip liner as far as lip
liners that are closer to my natural
skin I've been using this one this one
is Mac's nice and spicy this is the one
I've been using and put it that's the
one I've been using even though it's not
really my natural lips it's a little bit
darker I feel like it looks nice under
pretty much everything so that's what
I've been doing lately but I really
don't use a lot of lip liner because
it's an extra step and because I use a
lot of colors that are so close to my
natural lip color I don't use a lot of
lip liners I want to know what everybody
else thinks though cast as I swear by
lip liner as I sent as since I got nerve
damage in my face from my wisdom teeth
oh my gosh my lipstick is guaranteed to
escape it just on that on that side wow
that's crazy well that's great that you
found something that works for you
though that's wonderful tabs as clear is
great Cindy rules are made to be broken
do which works for you we all age
differently totally agree totally
totally agree and let's do it speaking
of that let's go to the last tip let me
make sure I got them all one was no
powder two was no witch lip colors work
that's with your skin tone I agree with
that but I don't like the advice
underneath blush place it at the places
that naturally occurs eyeliner to the
lower lashes lipsticks migrating going
overboard with concealer avoiding
sparkles always fill in sparse brows
right brow pencil color pearly not
frosty never skimp on primer remember
that less is more
that's tip number 12 we've all seen the
woman who wears too much makeup if you
look in the mirror and see makeup rather
than
you it may be too much says Joseph
instead of trying to conceal what you
believe are your flaws accent what you
really love without your face instead
your eyelashes eyebrows your color your
lips others rarely see your brown spots
dark circles or uneven skin tones she
adds people see what's attractive so
play up the features you love instead of
trying to hide something you don't like
check your motivation for wearing makeup
is it fear or fun go for fun see you're
telling me go for fun but then you're
telling me I can't have any fun make up
your mind
Joseph advises and they enjoyed the view
I don't know how to say about that
French term I've never heard it spoken
out loud I'm not gonna butcher it taking
joy in living is feel like wearing dark
lipstick I do agree with with you know
enhancing the things that you love about
your own face I agree with but I think
that if you have to do you man and we've
all see the woman who wears too much
makeup really really judgey much judgey
much I don't like that statement at all
mmm Angela says there's such a thing as
too much base makeup never too much eye
shadow lip fun I think you just have to
Jen says I've seen women who look like
clowns but that's your opinion though
that's your opinion though if she wants
if she likes the way that looks I feel
like we should let her and look how she
wants to look you know like I'm all
about doing what makes you happy and it
has nothing to do with outside has to do
with your inner person and what you love
and what you love to do in the way you
love to look and I'm all about that so I
say throw the rules out the window take
what you like from this live stream from
other articles that give you rules take
what you like apply them ditch the rest
and for every person that's going to be
unique you know like I
and everyone has a right to disagree if
you choose to disagree that my opinion
is not the end-all it's just the way
that I personally feel and that's why
we're the collective brain because we
all have different different opinions
Myra says whatever happened to women
empowerment or rather human being
empowerment yeah I mean empowering
people to do what makes them feel
comfortable in their own skin I think
that's what it's all about you know
rules schmules
do what you want you know do what makes
you happy all right I gotta get out of
