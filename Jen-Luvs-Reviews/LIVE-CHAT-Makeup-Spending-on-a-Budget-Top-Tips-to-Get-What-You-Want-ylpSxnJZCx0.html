organized chats things of changing
engine lows reviews land we're doing
things a little bit differently
hopefully people like the changes and
hopefully you'll communicate with me and
let me know what you like what you don't
like I'm still in mind sticking of
things that are changing let me pause my
own voice that would be helpful so
actually on Sandra who did the video
with me where we made the lunch bag and
she's here in chat right now hi Sandra
sorry I didn't return your text earlier
I was trying to get the video live she
had this great idea about doing like
themes for the chat so that we could go
back and reference it later and said it
just kind of being a random free-for-all
of information so that's what we're
going to be doing this week and we'll
see how it goes we'll see how you guys
like it my family is going to be coming
back after chat is over and we're going
out right afterwards so actually going
to the Maryland Renaissance Fair which
I'm really excited about um so I'm all
dolled up and ready to go to the
renaissance fair but I wanted so it's a
little bit different in that way to also
if people are going to come back and
reference this video I figured I might
as well put a little makeup on so anyway
let's go ahead and get into the topic of
today's show let me just say hello to my
friends I see lots and lots of people
that I am so excited to see hi one joy
hi Annette hi Krista hi I think it's min
min ji min ji we're gonna say min ji Hye
KJ hi Shannon Anna kanya Leslie good
morning good morning Jenny good morning
Lee Ann I'm so excited to have you all
here in D kitty one good morning oh yes
Marylin rent renaissance festival is
pretty awesome good morning Valerie and
Robin so good to see you guys and Sandra
good to see you ok so let's go ahead and
get into o beauty haul 411 must follow
on Instagram amazing amazing Instagram
channel so let's go ahead and get into
our topic and I'm curious to see what
you all think about this topic and
whether you have thought of ways to
budget your
that I may not have thought the first
thing that I want to talk to you about
is just kind of setting aside a budget
and knowing how much you're going to
spend at the jump of the month so one
thing that I do is I have an app that I
use hashtag not sponsored this is just
an app that I use that they don't know
that I exist and it's a budgeting app
and it's called it looks like it's just
called spending I don't know but but
basically what it does let me go switch
over to the view so I can make sure that
I can you guys can see what I'm seeing
so like for example i click on let me
show you what the icon looks like so you
know what to look for so it looks like
this and it's a little wallet I'm not
sure what the official name is now that
I'm thinking about it I probably should
have looked that up I thought it would
be right there but it's not so there's a
there's a thing that tracks your
spending so income is here let me go to
a month that actually entered something
in okay so let's go to August so my you
guys are going to see how much I make on
youtube now okay so this is how much I
made in August which was a lot that was
the most I ever made in a month it's in
663 dollars and then I spent ninety nine
dollars and forty-eight cents and then i
categorize everything so I've got my
even type in income you can type in your
expenses and what you bought and then
you can look and see your transaction so
you can see that i got this afford give
me some lip kit I got some stuff from
colour-pop ebates i got a check from
ebates so that was part of my income for
that month nadine west i got six dollars
in commissions so I got two people that
signed up and then my YouTube earnings
was 554 dollars so I didn't make that
much on YouTube that that was just well
but still that's how much I made that
one so I keep track of everything here
and that way I make sure you don't go
over budget my budget is 100 dollars a
month so i made ninety nine dollars and
forty-eight cents i made it so that was
my august budget the timber I was really
bad at really bad at keeping it I've
definitely spent money in September I
just haven't logged it in yet but anyway
my point is is to kind of keep a budget
and make sure that your your kind of
keeping up on it I know that's hard for
some people oh Jenny said she uses it oh
that's so cool good morning cheri TMI
flow Jenna mamama foreign since I had
two major surgeries and two months my
husband is the all
working so besides the free stuff I've
been able to buy any makeup in a while
all good morning Nicki Nicki are now she
is our appt reporter good morning to you
Nikki um yes spending tracker that
sounds right Robin that sounds like what
it is ok so anyway so I di use my app
and that really helps me a lot now the
next thing that I do a lot is I make a
wish list of things that I realistically
can purchase so when I see something
that comes out like I knew I wanted the
lorac mega Pro to I knew I wanted the
the two ba not the two-faced set that
was an impulse buy I knew it wonderful
rock mega pro two I knew that I wanted
the kat von d palette the which called
the rainbow one the media loka palette I
knew I one of those two so i budgeted
those in now this month is not a good
example of me budgeting because anyway
I'm gonna pretend like i was on a budget
this month should I pretend or should I
be real I don't know I should be real
but what the point is it's like what
I've done in the past in past months
because I can't lie like I'm really bad
at lying so it's kind of like I have a
choice of like telling you guys but I
really did this month and what I
probably should have done this month and
we're just going to talk about what I
should have done this month so one thing
that I think is is a killer for me as
impulse buys so like for example I got
this this was a total impulse buy this
was the two-faced a little funky set
thing this thing i bought this on an
impulse buy and then I realized I didn't
have enough money in my budget to buy
the Kat Von tape helmet neck Phylly this
thing is terrible so I'm going to be
taking it back I haven't taken it back
yet but I ended up buying the kat von d
palette anyway but it was like stupid
because i bought it impulsively because
it was so pretty and then I was like now
I can't buy the kat von d palette so
like thinking about the things on your
list oh I want the jem the holograms
palette too oh my gosh me too um oh my
gosh i'm reading about the spectrum
pilot Lee Anne says the two-phase the
Urban Decay spectrum pilot is better
than the vice for that's very
interesting
okay all right I gotta get back to my
I'm getting distracted because i want to
read what you guys are saying so so
thankfully that's terrible so that now i
could buy the kat von d so the point is
is to keep a list of all of the things
that you really truly want and then
compare them in your mind can i get rid
of the kat von d if I by the two-faced
you know soon I'm Sam so that's one
other thing that I personally do let's
go ahead and look at some of the
comments really quickly nerdling volta
Tabitha says go visit the website yes
are what's been makeup website is fab
nikki says I didn't want any I pallets
but I've been seeing the kat von d ones
right now and i want it i know it's hard
it's hard to stay on a budget it really
is Lee Anne says she got this before to
face too and it was ok yeah I'm actually
wearing it today I found a couple of
shades that are really really good at it
then I'll be sad to let go when I return
it but it's not worth the full price of
it let me show you what i'm wearing on
my eyes today i'm wearing this one here
this is called wish list all over my
eyes and this one called cobblestone it
swatches terribly but it actually works
very nicely and then I'm wearing this
one in satin sheets in the inner corner
so those are the three that I used but
like I'd use this pink one here I've
used this one in dreamlike here I've
used quite a few of these and they're
not great they're really not great
quality I mean they blend away oh I use
this purple one down here not good I
mean just look look the only not worth
sixty dollars so all right so yeah so
this is going back to the store Tara
baby said the two face palette is not
great I'm with her I'm totally with her
totally with her um Lee Anne says the
spectrum palette is very pigmented and
no fallout so far that's really good to
know Lee Anne thank you so much for that
ok I'm trying to pronounce your name
minji I'm gonna call you Minji and if
I'm wrong then let me know she says
she's gonna buy the kat von d palette
when she's in the US that's awesome um
Sarah says satin sheets looks like the
buxom shadowed is amazing cool man TMI
float Jensen she said the kat von d is
your favorite brand I'm saying saving to
get something from her but don't know
what to get any suggestions for kat von
d
I you know honestly like right now all
of the things that I've loved from Kat
Von D she's not selling anymore I love
her blushes a lot of the palettes that I
love she's not selling anymore I would
say her liquid eyeliner is amazing i
would definitely budget for that late so
I can get back on topic I would
definitely budget for her liquid eye
liner in trooper it's amazing that's a
really good one let's see oh here we go
anyone sherry says anyone heard the new
Lancome palette I heard it's very
powdery I heard the same thing too I
watched a video by emilynoel83 yesterday
she said that the land calm the the
Paris one was not good audacity one she
said it was terrible which was very
interesting I was surprised about that
now he says hey Jen just wanted to let
you know that I'm still going to month
strong my makeup no by good for you
Valerie well done round of applause for
you wonderful well done alright I'm
going to go ahead and move on to my next
tip okay um and I just when you think
about buying something and possibly
compare that purchase is something
that's on your list and you want that
more the next one is one that you
already know because you watch youtube
videos is to do you research beforehand
and you don't have to be the first
person to buy something I mean I feel
like if you've got a YouTube channel and
you're trying to review things then yeah
I guess so but I mean you guys they
don't have to you know buy things off
you know that our brand brand new you
know definitely try if you can if you
know if you don't think it's going to
sell out wait until you can see some
reviews if you've ever been a makeup
ally makeup ally as a fantastic website
of course youtube reviews what else did
I write down um so 40 reviews are
amazing on their website I feel like
sometimes afford reviews are a little
bit off though for some reason I feel
like sometimes they um like people maybe
don't have as much experience with
makeup like they'll say something that's
like completely off from the purpose of
the product in the review or they'll
review a product based on the shipping
of the product or something and it's
like to that is not helpful that's not
often all so Sephora reviews interpret
with caution but I feel like YouTube
reviews and makeupalley are really great
resources for reviews before you
purchase and I know that takes time
you know but if you find like some great
blog stam Talia is amazing if ever been
to tell talia her website is amazing for
reviews to see swatches and things she
does a grading system wonderful
wonderful blog it's my favorite blog
before i buy something she usually gets
things sent to her for promotion before
they come out so you'll get a chance to
see those products before they're in
stores and see whether she likes it or
not and from what I've seen she's really
on point as far as her reviews like if
she likes something usually if I buy it
I like it too so I definitely definitely
trust her and her reviews Leon says
they're selling the Becca afterglow
palette alta now I saw that on the
what's of the makeup appt this morning I
saw that they're selling it now they
weren't as of yesterday I didn't realize
it was gonna be today or else it
would've been in the show I did mention
in the show but I said it was coming
soon Shannon says sometimes on the
Sephora use people rate at low because
they aren't vib rouge in have to wait
for it which is not a little I totally
agree completely agree um no II an says
that she says she's gay she's not um
that's why I'm getting it she's I guess
about the becca palette and that says
I'm sorry can I ask you guys for a bit
of a help I have a friend that had an
allergic reaction to hair dye what you
suggest okay that's for you guys because
I don't know anything both the mm like
what did you to take care of it
afterward oh my gosh that sounds
horrible that does not sound like fun at
all in that I wish I can help you with
that Cathy says Jen any tips for
budgeting for generation beauty my
budget is going to go out the window
I've been setting aside some money
especially for it how about you you know
what and this is a greatly great to go
back on topic I am I do have a budget um
for generation beauty i also have a
budget that I've set aside for the vib
rouge sale force' for that it's in
october i guess is VIP they do like vib
vib rouge and then they open up to me
and said her set twenty percent off or
they was fifteen percent off i don't
they keep changing it on me and I get
confused they did the for friends and
family for a while and only friends and
family could get it and then last year I
think they opened it up to more people I
think I don't know but anyway every year
in october i have a friend that works at
sephora that gets me discount codes so
um every year I do get something for
that twenty percent off so i've been
i've been budgeting for that and for
generation beauty
I think that it's one of those things to
where you have to decide whether it's
something you you know truly need in
your life something that you just want
to try something that you just want for
your collection um and and really
prioritize and don't let the sales and
the swatches and all that suck you in
because if you're not going to use it or
if it's a duplicate or something you
already have like you're getting you
know let's say I've got two things at
face primer open and rockin do I really
need another face primer no face primers
last forever I don't need any more face
primer so unless I'm doing it
specifically for a review i don't buy
face primer like there's no point so
when I go to generation beauty I am NOT
going to be buying anything like that um
you know I think it's just important to
keep everything in perspective and kind
of keep your makeup collection in your
mind as you're shopping about whether
it's only want or something that you
just want to try or something you really
need and just really saving for those
things you truly truly truly want and
then definitely sticking to a budget I
haven't decided one hundred percent my
budgets going to be for generation be I
think I'm gonna have to get there and
John's gonna be with me so we're gonna
like talk and chat as we go and he's
been spending a lot of money on his new
tattoo studio he's moving tattoo studios
to a bigger place so he has to do a lot
of furnishing and decorating and things
like that so he's been spending a lot of
money lately so that means my spending
needs to be cut down a bit so we'll see
what happens with generation beauty I'm
not really sure I see nikki says I want
the tart palette but the mini blushes
are so cute I know I want the many
blushes so bad but I'm not interested in
that and the melted in the melted lip
products I like them but I wish I could
just get the blushes on their own so I'm
waiting I'm totally waiting leann
compulsive on the holiday stuff yes
absolutely Chantelle I saw the review of
the Kat Von D's new palette on terror
babies channel and she raved about em so
tempted that's what really pushed me
over the edge for that Kat Von D caught
I didn't buy it initially and then for
about a day the me vida loca palette was
sold out on some force website and I was
like well I'm glad I didn't buy it
because sold out and I there's no point
me reviewing it if it's sold out and
then the next day it wasn't sold out
anymore it was like God now I gotta buy
it and it was mostly because of Tara I
mean like I
so like I totally I mean she she I'm
going around in circles bed she does
amazing reviews um and she has tried so
much makeup that she's got a really good
perspective on what's good and what's
not she does do a lot of super high-end
stuff though I haven't seen her do a ton
of drug store stuff but but yeah she's
another channel that I definitely
definitely trust Kyle I'm sorry your
computer keeps freezing that makes me
very very sad indie kitty one gem the
type melted lipsticks will be nice flip
as gifts that's a really good point
maybe I'll put that on my list of things
to get for the vib where the friends and
family vib rouge sailor whatever that
October thingy uh that's because that's
a really really good point Valerie says
another tip maybe don't watch as many
beauty gurus on YouTube with the
expection exception of Jen of course but
it's definitely helped me not to spend
as much yeah I mean it's really really
hard and I think one thing about what's
it been makeup that's really helped me
personally is seeing how much makeup
comes out every week and how much is new
I didn't realize how much new stuff came
out every single weekend it made me
realize I don't need everything that's
new I mean there's there's too much
coming out every week there's no way you
can get everything that's new you know
before what's up in makeup I just would
you know I'd see the thing that was
super hyped on YouTube and I'm say oh do
I want to get that but now I'm realizing
how much makeup comes out every week I
mean it's just ridiculous it's absolute
video so that's actually helped me to
not spend so much JJ says how much she
likes Tara that's awesome i do too
Chantelle says I really need to not buy
any more makeup as I'm eventually moving
to the UK and I can't take everything
with me that's a really good point as
well alright it's 11 17 so I'm going to
go ahead and go to my next tip which is
the cut back where you can and an ad
wait ok cut back where you can add money
to the makeup budget so like for example
I cut back on when I went go to the
grocery store I you typically buy like a
lot of snacks and things and things that
I don't mean so what I did was I took
that money that I usually spend on
snacks and I put it into my makeup
budget you know if you usually go to a
store to get a starbucks or you know
don't get your starbucks that one day
when you're like on
and I could I really want to starbucks
like no I could get some mascara instead
no Starbucks go get some mascara and
you're still on the same level as far as
you're spending you know what I'm saying
like takes up a little from here and put
it over here or when you're you know
maybe you go out to dinner once a week
and maybe cut out that going out to a
fancy dinner and order in instead or
cook a nice dinner instead and then use
that money towards your makeup budget um
you know just kind of transferring money
where you can you know that's another
thing that I do sometimes you know do I
need that chocolate bar or do I need the
new maybelline mascara i buy those
really like crazy chocolate bars the
ones that are like three dollars or four
dollars for one chocolate bar so I'm
trying not to buy those so that i can
add more to my makeup budget for the
holiday season coming up let's look at
some other comments a more scada says a
good way to keep track of makeup is
using OneNote I took pictures of my
makeup so when I'm out I see if I
already have it or something similar and
speaking of that if you use one note i
don't use one note i use this one and
i've talked about this on periscope i
believe but i haven't actually been able
to show you guys what it looks like
where is it where is it where is it
right here under lifestyle it's called
beauty cachet let me flip this around so
I can see Jenna cash envelopes are
helpful when the envelope is empty your
dawn that's a really good point too nice
one ND kitty one fantastic thing is you
need Jen somebody's I'm thinking your
name is Jen but I could totally be wrong
I like knowing people's real names
alright so let's go ahead and I'm just
going to show you this beauty cachet I'm
sorry if you like indie Kitty 1 i'm
really sorry if you're answering my
question and i'm not even watching i
will show you this real quick and then
i'll flip back over so this year I'm
trying to put a lot more products in
here but um as far as sorting my
products and and and keeping track this
is really good for a mascara again
hashtag not sponsored they don't know I
exist um so going to let's see so like
here expired products when I when I get
a new let me start off okay so here's
some of the products that I've gotten
recently since I got the app
and I'll click on one like for example
let's go to this brightening cleanser
DDF brightening cleanser I don't know if
you guys can see that so its ste DF its
I said the ounces it tells what it is I
got it at the Birchbox shop and I have
that there let me show you a mascara
that I have in here so here's the Jacob
UT lash primer it says the date that I
opened it was July twentieth of 2015 and
then i can type in three months later I
can roll into it and say October
twentieth of 2015 is when it expires and
this is another thing too is like I can
go into like fun thinking about buying a
nail polish click on the whim you know
I'm in the store i'm looking at you know
the new a/c collection i can if i was
organized enough if I had the time to do
this i would put all my nail polishes in
here and then kind of match it up and
see if I had any shades similar so this
is another tool to help you to not spend
as much as the kind of keep track of
your product so thank you for bringing
that up so that I could bring up my way
so there's a couple of different apps
I'm sure that there's other stuff is all
about my hashtag not sponsored stuff is
always in on my periscope so we're on if
you haven't been over to periscope
periscope is a lot of fun it's a Twitter
company and that's what we're going to
be doing our informal chats from now on
at least that's my plan from now on what
did I see um I someone whose entire
making flexion fits in a ziploc bag I'm
amazed that there are apps tella that
you're so funny all right um let's see I
see um Andy kitty yeah so my name is Jan
yes sweet I did remember it right I'm so
excited Marlena I would love to live in
the middle of nowhere are you talking
about Tara babies how she lives out
nowhere I'm glad I don't live out in the
only where I wouldn't be able to stand
it I need to live close two things I
forget things at the grocery store too
much like oh man I forgot I have to go
back and get something else um TMI flow
IMC up the cars changed the couch my
husband's pockets in the dryer it all
adds up i stopped counting at $18 wow
that's awesome Kaylee says great idea to
organize it all I have an account for
inventory LOL yes definitely having
lookout for inventory definitely helps
Nikki's also on my periscope a lot she
relates she said it's so fun steph says
yes keep your change banks I've
encounters and use them yup absolutely
chantel come over to periscope it's
really fun it's awesome um it's it's so
easy you know I tried snapchat and I had
the hardest time with snapchat oh my
gosh like I felt like the biggest idiot
I mean I only spent about 15 minutes to
run figure it out for those 15 minutes I
felt pretty dumb periscope is super easy
like really easy to do and it notifies
you like it gives me a little wobble
like when it when somebody's live like
it gives me a little notification
because i have my notification set to be
on so that's really nice so when
somebody you follow goes on you can
click on it and then see what they're
doing which is really really cool
periscope is super easy super easy um
and it's also like it rolls like this
like a chat window it rolls like that so
we can have like informal chats and talk
and stuff it's really cool I love me
some periscope definitely you guys
definitely come over to periscope and
there's lots of people on there another
person that I follow on periscope that's
awesome as raw beauty Christy she does
great periscopes absolutely um let's see
if we like KJ i just bought the Urban
Decay shadow i already had i need to
keep better track oh no I'd pretty sure
that periscopes for Android it's a
Twitter company so I would imagine is
for Android as well Shannon doesn't like
snapchat either um min ji says I says I
have an inventory for my makeup i'm
buying less makeup that's awesome steph
says the machines themselves are a pain
to unload and stuff i work at a banking
that fund on Lotus I can see why they're
getting rid of them oh they sokoine
counting machines that's good to know um
a mirror hall I'm going to say I'm near
a halt what are your thoughts on selling
makeup you don't use any why of tons and
I can't seem to let it go you know I
feel weird about selling it um I don't
feel weird about giving away to a good
home but I always feel weird about
selling it I also feel okay about
trading it but something sets wrong with
me about selling my used makeup I don't
know I know a lot of people do it I'm
not knocking people to do it I think
that's fantastic but I don't know I just
I don't know it just it's weird to me um
i would buy somebody's use makeup though
but i wouldn't sell mine I don't know
what's up with that it's so weird i
don't know but that's my thing my
periscope is just Jen loves reviews its
the same everywhere I'm download reviews
on Instagram on Twitter on periscope I'm
Jen loves reviews everywhere nikki says
the high end makeup companies did some
great behind the scenes from Fashion
Week yeah so I saw that yes and um
Tabitha's periscope is on android glam
bot freaks me out stuff says um let's
say Florrie couldn't figure out snapchat
either that's good to know i'm not the
only one I'm glad you're downloading
periscope now you can join us on our
periscopes I've been doing a morning
getting ready with knees and those have
been really fun and then I cook at night
and everybody helps me with my cooking
nikki has been fantastic with held him
in my cooking like I like showing her my
pot of boiling water and it's like is
this boiling is this does this look like
enough she's like not simmering you got
to keep it on the burner longer you know
what I mean like if you're like cooking
together there was an instance on
periscope just you know because how much
we talk about one topic you know I'm San
but um 1125 I'm just keeping my only
time um I was cooking on periscope and I
was having I had an issue where I had
gotten through the entire meal and it
was time to put the food in the oven and
I realized I didn't turn the oven on and
I was like oh my gosh what I'm going to
do and Nikki and all the other people in
the periscope were like just put it on
the you know put it on the on the
stovetop and it was too spicy for Lila
and they're like add milk and you know
like totally helping me out as I'm
cooking this meal and help me doctor it
off and fix it up it was so awesome like
my meal would not in your live but it's
good if I had been periscoping it and
getting advice from the people that were
watching me so it was pretty awesome um
but anyway I wish I should go back on
topic I'm totally off topic right now
another one that I wanted to talk about
is the devil of subscription boxes and a
mystery boxes you know it's like
gambling it really is it's an addiction
like gambling you know when you pull the
slot machine you don't know what you're
gonna get and and I feel like with if
you're on a budget the biggest devil is
subscription boxes in mystery boxes
because you end up spending ten twenty
thirty forty fifty dollars on mystery
items because
you like that surprise and of possibly
getting this amazing deal where you may
get a box full of all this amazing stuff
or you may get a box junk like you don't
know but then you could have spent that
fifty dollars on the urban decay you
know you know naked 3 palette of smoked
palette or whatever you wanted you know
and it's like man why didn't I just
spend my money on what I really wanted
and it's that mystery you know I've not
knowing what you're going to get but
then you end up like I found with
subscribing to so many subscription
boxes and getting subscription box it
said to me is that really do have a lot
of duplicate products a lot of a lot of
eyeliners like I have so many islanders
I could never in my and two or three
lifetimes go through as many eyeliners
as I have mostly from subscription boxes
and it's just it's not necessary so if I
wasn't doing reviews for YouTube I would
definitely probably unsubscribe to all
of my subscription boxes because I
really don't need them but I keep them
because I always have the intention of
doing subscription box refuse and then I
never knew them so um you know i'll
probably still keep them but it's still
like if i didn't have a channel i would
cancel them all um and then get things
that I truly truly want it so that's
just that's one thing and then the
mystery boxes are really evil Leon says
it's a mystery when you buy makeup to
without swatching and so I think that's
the way yeah absolutely absolutely and
you don't know what you're going to get
you on up with them at your skin tone
off is going to match your personal
preference leslie says the one reason i
haven't done subscription boxes before i
rather buy what I want absolutely Regan
says have been trying to decide if I
want to subscribe to Boxxy tremor use
the money to another product and it's
hard to tell because you see these
people get these amazing subscription
boxes you know like man I wish I had
that but do you want it more than the
mega pro 2 or do you want it more than
the vice for or do you want it more than
that your foundation that you wanted i
mean it's it's you know with it you know
two months of boxy charm will get you a
lot of your really nice product at
sephora so i mean it's it's really you
gotta decide what's best for you and
making that choice is very difficult
sometimes the jewel at mystery boxes oh
my gosh Nikki you are suppression of the
choir on the julep mystery boxes
oh my gosh haha yeah jen says I want all
the boxes for cats and none for pickup I
don't have a cat subscription box yeah i
wanna cat subscription box i should
totally get one oh my god my cats are
the only living thing in my house don't
get subscription boxes i was in my
turtle you my dog gets a subscription
but he know supports coming off a box
and of course i want to get it do i need
it no um nikki says boxing for me is
sucking the last three months from a
nail wraps come on well there-there's
but their scratch nail rouse and
scratching on wraps you're actually
pretty nice but the print it was a
little bit weird don't you think anyway
um I want to talk about the jewel at
mystery boxes because those are evil $25
and usually get over a hundred dollars
worth of stuff but at the same time do I
really need more nail polish no I don't
need more nail but like seriously like
I've got hundreds of bottles of nail
polish why do I need one elbow I don't
know because the color is pretty that's
why I need it because they give you the
little sneak peek of the really pretty
nail posh that's in the box and it's
like who pretty colors Oh like
mesmerized like I can't even focus
anymore like it's like you know like
being like you know like the circle and
those old cartoons where it was like the
black and white ring that would like go
around and around and then you'd see
like the ring going around and like the
cartoons eyes that's why I mutual at
mystery boxes I'm like pretty colors you
know I can stop every time I see one I
feel like I have to get it if I'm
attracted that color and I need to stop
it's terrible speaking of that um let's
say do I want to do that Oh see I have a
video coming out on the i'm not going to
show you because I i filmed a video for
it and it's gonna be up on the on my
youtube channel so i'm not going to show
you but i did I broke down on I got the
bare minerals mystery bag box thing that
video is coming up soon um I should talk
about just 50 male polishes the I'm
having trouble I need to do a nail
polish decluttering video ello anak
Allah wanek ilanic I'm gonna say is your
name I do need to nail polish
decluttering video I need you lots of
decluttering um I know you only live
once Leanne I'm totally
with you but I don't know I don't know
what magpie syndrome is I've never heard
of that oh I know what it is you're
talking about being easily distracted by
things distracted by shiny pretty things
yes exactly Jen unfold me and Chuck all
the company emails in the mailing list
agnott spots oh you're so funny oh
you're hilarious okay but anyway as I
was saying I'm getting distracted by all
the comments over on the side um but I
got the UM the bareMinerals it was
thirty dollars and they said it was
gonna be over a hundred dollars worth of
stuff and I did film a video on it so
I'm looking forward to showing that to
you and sharing that with you we'll see
how it goes we'll see how it goes i
don't want to brown Oh grow in the video
so I won't talk to you about that but
but yeah it was interesting it was very
interesting today we also get the bare
minerals mystery kit the Ted products
for thirty dollars maybe I'm the only
one that got it Shannon says one thing
to help your budget does not get the
emails from the companies that way
you're not tempted to get things because
they're on sale girlfriend that is an
excellent tip Shannon absolutely
shaman's always on my my periscope as
well Anya says remember when illamasqua
had a mystery box I remembered that but
it was right when i first did um when
i'm getting this jacket because i see
these things that are specifically for
me um the first my first started YouTube
one of the first videos i wash my
graveyard girl was her opening up at
illamasqua mystery box and there was
like moldy stuff in it and it was like
all gross so I always had this negative
thing in my head about illamasqua
because that was the first time I ever
heard of illamasqua since then of course
I've you know know that they're not just
like that but um but yeah i did i do
remember hearing about that her wild
idea says you should sell yourself on
poshmark there quite a few youtubers
that do it and then could try some stuff
and save some money I know but I feel
bad because I feel like I know it's like
almost like selling stuff to your
friends you know like I I wouldn't go in
with my makeup to work and be like hey
you know who wants to buy my use makeup
you know and I feel like that you guys
that you are my friends and I would feel
really weird selling you all my used
makeup like I don't know
i I just I don't feel comfortable with
that like I don't know I reckon in this
terrible i would rather it's it in a bag
not use then sell it to people you know
i'd rather donate it then sell it to
people i don't know i still have a whole
bag of stuff that I decluttered that I
need to divvy up and make sure that I I
send out i want to send some stuff out
to a bunch of people um yeah it's hard
to declutter nail polish I'm is gonna be
hard for me because I've got like let's
say 10 shades of red but they're all
slightly different do I need them though
I'm so glad you found me on periscope
yay barley says that was not mold the
girl was not so enjoy my graveyard girl
with the illamasqua um I should do more
training I was on e div for a while and
I really like that but then the mailing
things out I'm terrible appealing things
out um Kyla says you buy one holiday
thing what would it be the mega Pro too
because I have the mega Pro one and I
love it and I want it really bad steph
says I didn't count I must have like a
hundred plus polishes and that's me
getting rid of a bag mm-hmm oh yeah I'm
with you I do like trading I do like
trading Leeanne and I want to trade some
more I do I want to go back on Eid if
it's just mailing things out is
difficult for me um dad says I'm a gamer
my friend wants to buy my old xbox would
be great because i would get money for
but i feel bad i know that's exactly the
way that I feel it's exactly what I feel
caelus is going to do more decluttering
yes I want to the problem is some way
backed up on videos of things I've
committed to do so it's difficult for me
to add in more but I definitely need to
I want to do it hopefully I like we get
settled into fall and winter all gets to
do more decluttering Tyler hi Tyler I've
been listening in a while and I've been
cooking breakfast the budget is so
important i use google docs only allow
myself fifty dollars a month for beauty
about I've been saving it for holiday
stuff see that's really smart good job
Tyler that's awesome chantal says I had
the kat von d palette that i would like
to sell and it's in great condition in
canada there isn't much out here to help
sell trade makeup ah um
um oh I've got feedback coming through
hold on a minute that's because i don't
have my microphone and I don't know if
the microphone is going to work today
because I got you guys up on my chair
then I film with the one that I sit on
for what's up in makeup that's what
you're sitting on right now so let me
see if I can get my microphone plugged
in because that would definitely help if
there's any feedback that's that's an
interesting i do it idea pandora says
jen maybe have a trading section on the
app the only that makes me nervous is if
somebody goes on there and starts
ripping people off i'll feel awfully bad
um I want to feel me onia put this and I
would feel really really bad if somebody
got ripped off from using my website
like I i would feel responsible for it
so i don't know makes me nervous okay
let me plug in this this microphone and
see if that helps say I always forget to
do this for some reason huh okay is that
better can you guys hear me better it's
1136 we're getting to the next half of
the the show here okay I don't know what
PP is Nikki Oh paypal yes okay let me
just make sure that everything's going
well are you guys hearing me better now
is it better hope so okay good awesome
thank you very much tabatha I appreciate
that hon okay so i just have to be
careful not to tap my microphone by
accident the last tip that I was going
to mention this was the last one I had
written down but I love hearing all of
your ideas as well is about sales and
deals like keep an eye on the drugstores
I mean you guys already know that keep
an eye on the drugstores ebates is
amazing I just placed an order at
sephora they have eight because i bought
the UM the kat von d palette and i broke
down and got the vice for because i
wanted to do a comparison video and I
feel like the Vice for and the kat von d
1 or similar in that they both have a
lot of bright colors and things so i
ordered those to Calais and i ordered at
art brush set
and then I'm done I went way over budget
and I'm done and I as soon as I take the
two-faced thing back it'll make it a
little bit better but I'm like forty
dollars over budget at this point but
anyway I use ebates and I got twelve
dollars back I'm using ebates and if you
don't know ebates ebates is amazing i
know people talk about it on youtube all
the time and it sounds super hokey but
it's not it totally worked it's amazing
it's fantastic for the holiday season
because a lot of times they'll even have
with best buy and you know a lot of
technology places you know you'll see a
lot of a lot of big companies will have
% back cashback when you when you do
when you do ebay so that ebates really
is phenomenal and of course i have my
ebates link below but please don't think
that's why I'm mentioning this just go
to ebates calm and sign up it really
really really is amazing I I guess they
get paid through their advertisers and
things like that but ebates is amazing
um and then you can keep an eye out for
that eight percent cash back at Sephora
it's very very helpful Nikki likes
ebates as well the sales always get me
Tyler says only use ebates a few times
but it works posted on all 26 % today
that's awesome I wish they had ebates in
your country two men zhi seen nikki says
she's going about two hundred dollars in
a year on ebates christmas shopping is
the best time of you it use it Lee Anne
says Lee Anne's account 482 dollars from
ebates Wow Robin says ebates is legit
for cash back but they would never send
me my ten dollar gift card for the promo
wise you should email them and find out
why
okay sorry I'm sitting here reading and
Leslie saw by the six percent back from
Ulta on ebates and Akane alikes ebates
teammates is really good um Chantelle
says she's forgetting that you baby you
didn't you can do like a little you can
add it to your bar there's like a thing
where you can add it to your browser a
little teammates button and it'll pop up
when you go to a website where you can
use ebates which is pretty cool that's
what my husband does he's got that on
his but I don't yes tabatha thank you
for reminding about that the top five
article on the website is all about
rebate apps this month and I can many
can be stacked so definitely check out
the what's at the makeup website tabatha
maintains that for me and she's the one
that does all the top fives so
definitely head over to the what's up
and make a website for that thank you so
much for that tabitha lee ann says it
was supposed to be mailed to you did you
give them an address i got mine oh tell
matt the about the gift card I hope so I
hope so kyla says when you get vib rouge
you supposed to get ten percent off i
didn't i didn't i did not get any kind
of discount my night when I went to
ruche no Bruges is not that amazing um
for for Sephora it's it's not that fab
it's okay um but you can get the free
shipping i think it's ten dollars a year
or something for free shipping from
sephora um Anna Kanye says she has the
app on her phone and a button on her
macbook for ebay that's good Grady says
always ebates always made me pretty
skeptical so I hurt so many people and
here give it a legit review I know
because it doesn't seem like it would be
real you got Kyla you got four vib
you've got ten percent I didn't get that
that's really weird man it's really
weird i keep forget about my coffee
because it's behind me usually it's next
to me um weird that's awesome for you
that you got your ten percent that's
cool so those were the different tips
that I had as far as saving money I
would love to hear some more tips from
you guys as far as how you budget your
money I mean I think that really the
biggest thing is definitely prioritizing
and making sure that you're thinking as
you're buying do I want this instead of
this than I already decided that I want
it and and not doing those impulse buys
and really trying to keep yourself under
control and saying you know what I do
have self-control and I can do this and
I can control myself because sometimes
it's really hard to control yourself
when there's something that you really
really really want and you got that card
in your hand you know if you just hand
that card in you can have that thing
that you want you know what I'm sayin
like that's my biggest thing is I know
that I can hand a card and get what I
want but is that the smart thing to do
and it's sometimes it's just a matter of
picking that thing up putting it down
and walking away and I remember when
Sandra and I went out shopping we Sandra
that was in here I don't know she's
still here I haven't seen her type in a
while Sandra died were shopping and she
was trying to get me to buy some stuff
at Mac and I was like I'm not doing it
man I'm not doing and it was really hard
because she showed me all the school
stuff she's a huge mac fan and I don't
own a lot of mac and it was like it was
so hard it was so hard to walk away but
I had to just be like look I don't need
this and I had to walk away it was hard
cuz friends can give you some peer
pressure you know as far as buying
things friends can totally give you peer
pressure and you got it's just sometimes
be like no it's ya know um Pandora says
I just went platinum adulta too i have
got another great deals half off the
Urban Decay strategy shadows the other
week yeah I'm not a platinum at Ulta um
I spend all my money at Sephora but now
after the vib the the Rouge the point
scandal thing that I'm not as pressed
over my support points as I used to be
so I'm more open to shopping at Ulta
than I was I was trying to put all my
eggs in one basket you know anything so
that I could get the most awesomeness
but now it's like I'm realizing ulta
points really are probably better than
sephora points so now I'm feel like I
need to make that switch but then
there's some things that's afore you
can't get it Alta so it's hard to
completely make the switch and I like
the exclusive things that are exclusive
to sephora better than the things that
are exclusive to Alta like I would
choose kat von d / lorac overall you
know I would cheat just that I don't
know man it's hard it's hard because I'd
rather stock up all the points at one
location instead of splitting them
between two if I could know most bang
for your buck but it's hard
it's definitely hard to do that nangi
says my friends aren't into makeup so I
don't really have that problem the other
way around here yeah I hear you on that
I don't have close friends that I see
all the time all my all my friends that
are bad influences on me as far as
makeup are people that I've met on my
app ends on YouTube jen says when i get
my income raise i'm going to keep drug
drug store all year and i was thinking a
sinking fun for christmas presents jen
if you have a cash envelope might work i
am totally with you all that cash
envelope that is really really really
smart on Akane I Gemma best step is keep
watching you because you really keep me
grounded oh thank you you are so awesome
i'm trying on trying Leon says djemba
can you can get that hot new holiday
stuff first I know I am oh I'm getting a
holiday stuff I already did it's on the
way ah tion sell one hundred eighty
dollars from vib rouge I'm getting
closer I didn't think I was gonna make
it but I might at this point oh she
hadn't you were so sweet Florrie says a
platinum through 2016 how much do you
have to spend to be platinum it's at
Ulta I don't even know Sandra says I for
myself to cut back on the negev spending
trying to use up stuff which is really
what we should be doing is trying to use
up what we have before we buy more but
it's so hard when you see something
that's so pretty and it comes down to a
collection I mean some people collect
you know action figures and some people
collect video games and you know
everyone's got things that they collect
and a lot of us we just collect makeup
that's just our thing you know so I
don't think we should beat ourselves up
for having a collection as long as it's
done within reason in that it's not
stopping us from buying things that we
need because we're going over budget you
know it's not stopping us from from from
paying our bills and things because
we're going over budget or making us
feel uncomfortable or stressed out
because we don't have the money to pay
for things that we truly need because
we're spending too much on our Beauty
habit I mean I think that's where it
crosses a line but I think a lot of us
you know it's okay to have a makeup
collection there's nothing wrong with it
as long as it's not hurting you and your
life or causing stress in your life
because of the spending so that's just
my opinion video games is your vice
video games you know I haven't been in a
video gives a long time but when I was
me and I've really enjoyed them when I
was I really enjoyed the back of the day
Nintendo mmm huge Nintendo fan the
original I don't have any time to uh to
play video games anymore I wish I did
the kids want a video game system but I
haven't broken down got on one I agree
with you Chantal I'm totally with you as
far as you know that everybody collects
different things kaylee says the kat von
d palette has neutral colors you can't
beat that many colored with neutrals
yeah it does look really beautiful I
missed what Tabitha said polishes in
college my weakness weakness for you and
me both you and me both what's four
hundred dollars what did I miss four
hundred dollars I loved Atari man
pitfall was my jam pitfall and Frogger
were my Atari jams right there hi I'm
totally with you Leon we had pong did
you have pong we had pong I was really
little when we had pong but we had palm
put some video games all right yes oh I
know it right Cassandra says and have
you looked at all that two-faced
released I know all the stuff to face
released this week on their website so
much amazing stuff I hope it doesn't
have the same fallout issues I mean

could put my fingers in it Valerie says
she's trying to buy more books I'm
losing its going kind of fast now I'm
losing it yeah shantal says Frogger pong
and all of them Kaylee says as long as
it's being used to that's true
absolutely pitfall I'm telling you
pitfall was amazing it was like the only
game I could beat my big brother at was
pitfall that was it um yup I know I know
yup and then I remember the first Sega
Genesis i remember playing that and that
was really fun because graphics were
amazing like they look like real people

play it over my friends house
like I was like amazed by the graphics
of Sega Genesis like it's like wow Alice
says thank you elk you think she's like
she loves my makeup thank you so much i
tried something different i feel like my
under eyes are a little bit too late
like it's kind of freaking me out a
little bit i used something from the
bare minerals kit under my eyes and it
just feels like it's a little too fake
looking but I don't know I'm getting
used to it che gaw all right anyway all
right we've got about 12 minutes left
we're gonna leave it open to whatever
you all want to talk about for the last
12 minutes if you want to keep talking
about budget that's fine or we can
switch the subject it's totally up to
you guys whatever y'all want to talk

Qbert KJ say your brows wrong fleek I'm
too old to say that oh thank you you

different with my brows today as i put
on my regular brow powder and then i use
the benefit gimme brow over top and i
really like the way it came out I always
Nick left the brow gel always neglect
the brow gel I need to Scott neglecting
the brown gel I think it makes a huge
difference you know I put on the brow
powder and I can neglect the jail all
right Reagan says I'm trying to build my
makeup collection so far just have to to
face palace and don't know where to
start with everything else you go with
what you are inspired by that would be
my best advice is look and see what
you're inspired by you've got your
couple of pallets now where you want to
go next you want to go with lips you
want to go with blushes
you know they're there are definitely
some amazing lip products out there that
are high ends or even it's drugstore
amazing lip products and then blushes
bronzers contour there's so many other
places you can go highlights are really
fun to play with you know just they
wouldn't go what inspires you look at
your face look at your features see what
you love and kind of try to enhance that
Jen says my eyes look so pretty thank
you so much i miss what Cassandra said
let me go back up riska Sanders comment
Cassandra says would you review the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
versus the NYC smooth skin lost face
powder and translucent it's the only
drug store translucent finishing powder
that I could find without this tell face
here let me I'm going to take a picture
of your comments you look oh it's on
selfie mode all right let me take a
picture of it and that way I don't
forget all right Cassandra it's noted I
am so backed up with videos right now

committed to there's a company called
madam glam it sent me some things that I
promised I would make a video on also
perfectly posh my friend Jenny sent me

long ago but I didn't I would have saved
me a lot of money if i didn't i should
have just got in a box and just done um
k lee says you just have one I have
browse automatically I may not have
gotten into makeup l haha so funny
Chantelle Jen let us know how the red up
keeps him what you use yes i will i'll
keep you posted well you'll see it fade
um Nikki was showing me how she had her
hair done exactly the same way like a
year or two ago looked really pretty on
her i think didn't Nikki say you did it
yourself like that's pretty amazing if
you did it yourself I think you said you
did um oh who said they gotta run Jenny
bye Jenny thank you so much for being
here I appreciate you being here um yeah
so I'm really happy with it I think that
it's fun and different and I thought it
would be cool to go to generation beauty
with some crazy hair but that would be
be fun and it's not so crazy that I
can't get away with it at work so Leanne
says Benefit Cosmetics a virtual BB
cream eyelid primer anyone try this I
want to get get it but is 28 bucks and I
don't want to buy a primer that
expensive not know it's worth it you
know I'm really curious about it too i
haven't seen any reviews on it you guys
seen any reviews on that i haven't
searched for it but nothing's popped up
in my feed i'm really surprised because
benefit always hides up their stuff like
crazy and i have not seen any reviews on
it um kaylee hair stuff is hard for me
to get into my hair is curly I stick to
oils and style would I go but no idea
yeah nikki says no no I up kept it
myself I'm not that brave yeah you did
the no poo uh-huh yup nikki says she did
the no poo thing with her hair forever
and it worked out really well but I'm
totally scared of doing that like that
freaks me out I don't know okay KJ says
Danny reviewed it and she loves it and
tati reviewed it to tati like it
so I haven't seen it um Kyle I said my
mom did it when my boobs roots came in
use a red oh the red from the Treach eat
a chocolate bar that's another palette I
really wish that I had gotten when it
was brand new um okay coffee break with
Danny did the review of the UM the Air
Patrol okay anybody else besides a Danny
do the review we tied y'all to watch off
to watch Dottie's chop my hair off and
end up getting compliments on it so I
guess I did a good job okay that's
awesome I'm sure you did if you're
getting lots of compliments um baking
soda and apple cider vinegar I'm scared
man I'm so scared did tati like it I
didn't see anybody tell me whether tati
like the vit like the the BB primer
thing or not Italy an yer so funny you
know we're on the same page girlfriend
you know we're on the same page um all
right we got five minutes left what do
you guys want to talk about 45 minutes
without five minutes left but i do want
to I mean I you know what I found
actually I'm gonna tell you something
you know what I saw on the store the
other day I was in Alta and it's I'm
sure it's been out forever but it was a
benefit product and it was something
about lemon it was like a lemon under I
like um like a setting powder or
something it was like lemon something I
can't even remember what it is but oh my
gosh it looked amazing and I almost got
it but then I didn't end up getting
because it's like what do I need to need
this for I think this thing's probably
been out forever and I didn't even
realize there was something about lemons
and it looked really interesting all
right when I've heard you know let ya
the lemonade exactly kyla exactly that's
what I'm talking about the lemonade
thing yeah I'm Nikki I'm surprised that
Emily no L didn't review that BB primer
either um but yeah I really like to try
that product but I wanted to do some
research research on it so you know as
not to go over my budget going back on
time um else missing what was I talking
about before the lemonade I got
distracted
Sean by the BB prime are trying to find
it o ND kitty one Jen says do the no poo
during the summer when you have time to
let your hair a ja Scotty did a review
okay yes um keightley we were talking
about the benefit the Air Patrol BTW i
primer thing is what she um which he
tried and liked Kyla says i was told i'm
posting too much he you're not posting
too much do what you want girlfriend
Tyler says benefit lemonade crees my
lids but it's okay under the eyes that's
good to know no poo is when you don't
wash your hair you just put the stuff in
your hair and it cleans your butt Wales
out of your hair without washing it and
it helps your color stay and longer more
sky said I need to head out I have a
great week see y'all next week hopefully
a wake up on time haha right where is
gonna good to see you maybe i'll see you

anxious to get that on the to face brush
set that i ordered it looks super cool
hopefully it's awesome one thing that's
really cool about where I live is I'm
really close to sephora so if i take
something back it's really not too far
out of the way to do it it's who i'm
sorry i didn't mean to scratch the
microphone it's it's not too far the way
to do it so that'll be good if something
doesn't work for me oh the when lawsuit

what makes me want it but um I use my
moisturizer with SPF and put all over my
lids she doesn't think she needs it yeah

as well I'm gonna watch it next she's
amazing I can trust her opinion
absolutely and she is a friend of what's
up and make up Lily Lily Spurgeon who's
one of my good friends she actually
emailed makeup and beauty blog she email
karen and got permission for us to use
her images and things on on the show and
i really appreciate that from karen
because we've gotten a lot of no's from
people a lot of really popular blogs
they've told me they do not want me
using their pictures which is makes me
really sad because it's kind of a
cross-promotional thing but I mean I
totally understand they have a right to
their content but I was really happy
that Karen was allowing me to use her
stuff so karen has a big thumbs up for
makeup and beauty blog from me deepam
