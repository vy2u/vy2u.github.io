what's of a makeup chat I am hoping that
this is working every single time I
start it's like is it actually working
or not I have no idea and it takes a
good 30 seconds to a minute for me to
realize whether it's working or not so
good morning to everyone i'm going to
assume that it is working thank you for
being here thank you to the collective
rating of makeup awesomeness also known
as the people who are in the what's of a
pickup chat this morning good morning to
you all I'm going to take morning to
individually in just a second but we are
going to tell you what we're going to be
talking about today I'm starting to kind
of run out of topics we've talked about
a lot of topics in the what's with
makeup chat we've had 52 topics this
year probably not that many we probably
had about 48 topics because we do this
almost every week um and it's getting
closer to the end of the year and it's
hard to think of new things to talk
about so I was looking around and I try
to figure out what we're gonna chat
about and I said well maybe we can just
talk about what I have and give you guys
some time to to kind of just ask me
questions about products that i have i
can show you things that i have you can
swash things and i have and just kind of
have a big old swash party and
discussion about makeup in general
instead of having like a specific topic
so you know I've got all my contouring
stuff I've got home flushes about my
eyeshadow palettes I've got liquid
lipsticks I've got regular lipsticks
about similar shadows I've got I mean
anything you could possibly want to talk
about I have something from that
category primers and you know I mean
everything nail polish and brushes and I
think I would just leave it up to the
collective brain to decide which topics
you're going to talk about today any
questions you may have already sweating
this is mia to good son good thing you
guys can't smell me i did put on
deodorant this morning but i have not
showered yet so so far so good deodorant
is working well okay i'm glad you guys
don't have smell-o-vision I'll tell you
that alright so let's go ahead and Oh
Helen saying you should do a live
decluttering you know I thought about do
at this money but the pressure is so
hard on a live declutter because like
one thing that I can do is like when I'm
actually filming a declutter is I can
make a choice and then I can always edit
that choice out if I decide I want to
keep it but if it's live if I say it's
gone it's gone and there's nothing I can
do to bring it back you know because I
like to stick by my word when I was able
to do something so before we go anywhere
else and I we are going to be doing
questions in just a second I want to say
hello to the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness the chat does go pretty
quickly collect a break so if you are
you ask me something I don't see it feel
free to wait a minute and then ask again
because i don't see everything so let's
go ahead and say hello and good morning

are you kidding me I need to break up on
my my highlighters and blushes from work
out I love their highlighters and
blushes i also like their lips lip
glosses the whipped lip products is your
billing I don't they still make them but
they're really nice if they do um and to
be slick oh that's a good idea a good
dealing to kies here good morning and
karen is here gilded money exactly karen
little hammer 05 is here working on
homemade christmas gifts while watching
what isn't that nice good morning to
Tabitha muah Amanda good morning to
she's separating her Christmas tree Lee
as Liz's in the house and Aspen is here
and Briana and long hammer 05 says 14
degrees in Wisconsin goodness gracious
reading mom is in the house
Rihanna thank you for being here Helen
and Deidre and saucer Jess than 1 i'm
going to go ahead and scroll all the way
down to the bottom and let's see this
era says jen you should wear your pjs
most of us probably are if i had cute
PJs i would totally wear my PJs but i
don't have cute PJs i wear a tank top
and shorts or a tank top and sweatpants
and it's not cute maybe I should ask my
husband for some cute pajamas for
Christmas all right carolyn says you
ever get overwhelmed by your collection
feel like you can't keep up since um the
companies are always coming out new
stuff yes I feel overwhelming but my
collection all the time and it's like
totally the dumbest problem to have and
I agree with this that having too much
makeup is a problem but it's like one
thing that I personally have you know
I'm not happy with some tonics is that
I'm possibly trying new things so
there's products that I've bought that I
really really love that I don't get to
use as often as I want because I'm
trying something new and it taking me a
good week to try something new to get an
opinion on it so it like upsets me that
I can't go back and try and use some of
the products that I've been enjoying
life have I use the two-phase this one
the Nicki tutorials called I'm looking
at this I have not used this once since
I reviewed it and it's not like it's a
fantastic color by any means but it's
like I'm hooking it like I don't use
this I want to use that and it's a shame
but the thing is is I do feel the needs
of people out of it because then when
somebody you know when the two days
comes out with a new palette or somebody
else can go 20 palette and I see that
it's similar to the Nicki tutorials I
can break this out and I can swatch it
so it's important for me to keep stuff
like this even if i'm not using it
regularly but at the same time it's kind
of sad you know and when I feel the most
overwhelmed is when there's a mess going
on um there you go to Tabitha says we
have pjs in a cafepress job and it's
funny because I did buy when we first
came out with a cafepress shop which is
on cafepress / download reviews i bought
the pajamas and then my dog ate the
pants they were really nice pass though
I wasn't the shirt was a little bit like
it wasn't as soft as i would have liked
but the pants were awesome and I
doggie so I'm the fancy my hope that we
purchased Christmas says you could try
doing a look of the week thing so that
you could use your favorite products I
should I should and puts their some days
to that I actually don't do um I don't
wear makeup every day like yesterday I
didn't wear makeup so Kathy says do you
like the master pilot by Mario I did not
buy it because they were suppose to be
super limited edition and it's kind of
pointless for me to get something super
limited edition if I'm not playing on
reviewing it and it was one of those
things where it wasn't I wanted time my
schedule to review what I had other
things other things listed speeding up
reviews I did buy two of the new
Smashbox many pallets after tati
reviewed them I bought two of them to
review because there's the thing at the
Smashbox I shadows I have issues with
Smashbox at ism that they don't usually
work for me but tati raved about these
things so hard that I really wanted to
try them so those are coming for video
uhhh let's see measure Emma I'm going to
say says what's what's your favorite
category in your collection my favorite
category my collection is my eyeshadows
absolutely I love my eyeshadows the
pallets and the symbols I love my
eyeshadows I love colors colors make
them happy Sierra says I started being a
lot more selective with my makeup
purchases but i'm not a youtuber doing
the reason what not yeah and i and i
would be more selective but i am
actually really selective with my
purchases I'm very selective I try to
only get things that I know i'm going to
review I try not to get things that I'm
not going to review but like I broke
down and for example to face was having
a sale on the sketch markers so I got
four of them do I need these know but I
just I really I wanted to try the colors
i tried the black and i really like the
idea of having more colors for different
folks because i want to get more into
more artsy eyeshadow so this would be
great tools for doing more artsy looks
more fun things i also broke down and
got some ouzo polishes that's what i'm
wearing on my nails today on my gosh
moon love the one that I'm wearing on my
nails today is where did it go is it
this one that's
this one this one is in the shade idina
and this is what I'm wearing I'll say
these with forty dollars each one black
friday or cyber monday so i couldn't
resist so i do buy things that i don't
really need for review but it's rare
it's rare lillehammer 05 says jen how
about that for a top of discussing the
first makeup products you use brands
colors if you remember etc and then see
if they're still around and what you
think of them now that is a great idea
that is like a mental note thing I want
to do a whole one on that but since I'm
I didn't say I was going to talk about
that this time I'm gonna stick with what
i said i was going to do but that is a
fantastic idea because i do actually
have a video of my entire makeup
collection it was my first very very
first video and it's just a handheld
video of me showing what i have in my
makeup flexion and it was a bad that's
big and that was my entire nigga flexion
home started this channel so amy wants
to know well I've been doing a collab in
2017 I have no collabs plan for 2017 but
there are some people i would love to
collab with in 2017 i just haven't made
moves to try to collab as far as clouds
with brands no not as of now i would not
say that i wouldn't collab with a brand
but honestly like I were to club with a
brand I'm more interested in helping the
brand's rather than putting my name on
something like I'd rather if you called
something else you know the rainbow
palette or something and then I just
help them develop it but it doesn't say
Jen loves were he's all over it you know
like you know what I mean like I
wouldn't want to be part of the
marketing of it I would want to help
develop it though that's just me sarah
says what I pixie dust is amazing I
agree lisa says what's your favorite
highlight palette all right if it's one
is out all right let's get some out best
nail polish brand julep is my favorite
followed by Zoya I like Alex
not as organized as I buzz contour
palette okay so I don't have a lot of
highlight pellets that are specifically
for highlighting most of my palettes
that I have or highlight and contour
together what breed is my dog my dog is
a Britney there cut that you could might
be fight him under Brittany spaniels but
he's a Britney he's kind of close to the
spangles what he's not this highlight
palette by elf is amazing let's watch
just watching this fun and it feels
really smooth when you put your fingers
in this it feels high-end um there's
that and it's just such a nice
highlighting palette the lasting power
is not fantastic on it let me try to
blend it out a little that you wouldn't
put it on that strength on your face
somebody get a little bit of shine off
of that for you so much favorite bronzer
I didn't have a favorite bronzer but I
would tell you if I had to pick one I
would say the butter bronzer by
physicians formula that's the only
bronzer I've ever truly enjoyed so
there's my that's the elf would it's
very nice and then I'll put next with
the hourglass both of these are really
good for texture and skin because
they're they don't have a from space
kind of look they just kind of brighten
up wherever you want to front me without
adding too much sparkle and shine
additional eyes I got to the dog hair on
me get off dog hair hate when that
happens alright so down here these three
are the hourglass so you can tell there
really isn't that much difference in the
finish between the Alps up here and the
hourglass down here and we're talking a
huge price difference there so they're
all very very very nice I really like
them and again these just bring light to
the face they're not from space let
glowy highlighters um Chris anna says
she has to Springer Spaniels oh that's
awesome is that Christina Han Christiana
and cosmetics
I hope so i'm trying out her liquid
lipstick she was kind enough to send me
a liquid lipsticks for Santa and
cosmetic if you never checked them out
I'm the middle of testing for liquid
lipsticks favorite blush and highlight
my favorite blushes or let's say
highlights the barrel essence matter
hold on I wish these doors female
out really really quickly that's the way
I feel right now very low very I can't
find her she's missing okay so all right
i'll look at there in a second talk
about blush and then i'll look back in
there so I'm gonna keep you waiting to
block my favorite blush is my favorite
formula
really good
shade it's just whatever they're amazing
I'm hoping that the chat did not freeze
it looks like it's frozen oh please go
start saying that it's frozen but it
looks frozen to me okay there we go okay
I pause no worries I paused while was
frozen okay so I didn't say anything I
didn't miss anything okay so anyway this
is the model code blush and amaretto
sunset I got this in a substitute in a
subscription box I think I got this a
boxy charm maybe this is really really
really good I didn't say anything about
was frozen i noticed it was frozen so no
worries so the instinct washes by the
bomb in case we missed that the insane
blushes by the bomb this isn't
houndstooth I also really like the one
who pinstripe this is the best blush
formula on Pacific planet as far as
highlights I tend not fine mary-lou
manizer by the bomb it's here somewhere
and I just couldn't find it quickly
another one I've really been enjoying
surprisingly that did not get great
reviews my friend Nancy sent this to me
this is the Pat McGrath gold gold
highlight it was part of a 003
collection really like this a lot I'm
surprised how much I like this whenever
I wanted a crazy from space highlighter
this is what I grabbed for it's just
really fun you know it's very creative
and fun and I love it and I'm surprised
how much I love this because it got
terrible reviews but I don't know ok I
hope it I like it something asked about
the colour-pop highlighters hello pop hi
leaders are really nice they don't last
a really long time on my skin that's the
only thing there is a dupe for that goes
opal which i think is called whisk and
then there's a dupe for her that I can't
remember off the top of my head what
it's called but there's a dupe for that
but they don't last as long on my face
as as mary-lou manizer does it's about
the same as back as opal the becca
highlighters don't last forever on so
you know Briana says do you use the
darker or lighter shade of the butter
broad i use legs bronzer and i don't
like the smell of this one and people
say they love the smell of this I don't
like this
like the best because when I was a child
school and whenever we would get ready
to go to the beach we would put on
slather on our son commotion Udall oh
and decrees we would slather on our
suntan lotion hopefully unfreezes and
then there were so many mosquitoes there
like I was always scared that the
mosquitoes were going to go after my arm
they were going to go after me like
wearing the suntan lotion so when I
schnapps it's like totally a
psychological thing that I know is just
in my head but this seriously makes me
think of going to the beach when I ya
know the difference I don't like the
smell bit but I love the product of
products fantastic if you like the smell
sup makes the other highlights the wet
while gold bar hopefully they bring this
back for max what is it max
was it all whisper of gilts max was her
guilt I swap sit next to whisper of
guilt when I was in Los Angeles my
friend Erica via the end the vlog
excellent podcast ice watch it next to
the whisper of guilt and it was exactly
the same so if you can find what and
wild bulb are definitely recommend
lasting power is very very good letter
says mosquitoes great i'm wearing it
today i hope i don't get attacked
hopefully there's no mosquitoes this
time of year that would be terrible and
it was really just that island just had
a mosquito infestation they're
surrounded by marshlands and there was
they used to spray the streets and try
to get the mosquitoes gone but a serious
mosquito infestation but it was a great
childhood to spend there I love going up
with just love to see all right so
anyway so those are my three favorite
highlighters I know stupid Wi-Fi I'm
about to switch over my Wi-Fi I have a
product that i've been trying to reveal
i'll show it to you because I feel
really bad it's company sent us to me a
long time ago if you remember that
you're going to see everything behind
you but this is called a high mirror and
this is a smart near and they've been
trying to I've been trying to review
this for over a month and I can't get it
to connect and it has something to do
with the way my Wi-Fi is set up so I'm
working on that so hopefully when i
change the Wi-Fi for the high near
hopefully it will work there but yeah
this is a really really cool product if
i can get it to work i haven't tried it
so i can't review it but like it tracks
your skin care so when you believe
that's what it's supposed to do when you
are i'll put the link if you're watching
some replay i'll put the link down in
the description below but again i can't
vouch what I've never tried it because I
it doesn't work with my particular Wi-Fi
settings but it tracks your skin care
over time so it like it takes a picture
of you and then it tracks where all your
big bazaar where your blemishes are when
you're just clinician is where your fine
lines are it tracks all of that and then
after that they attract them time to see
what your skincare is actually working
or not it also tells you the weather
when you turn it on it plays your
Spotify
so it's not a lot of really cool
features but I only been able to use it
yet so hopefully in the next couple of
days I'll be able to get this going and
hopefully that will also help the Wi-Fi
on the chat so um so yeah this is going
to be a sponsored video just so you know
so I guess this now is this chad
sponsored like this i guess because i
just talked about it but it is a sponsor
video but i'm not going to review it
until I tried it they know you know you
guys know me respond to videos i'm not
going to uh and it says oh h no oxy I
don't want for that my sub tract I think
it's just one of those things and he had
$175 something like that yeah I think
it's like 175 if it works I think it'll
be worth it yeah and there's this
privacy cat Tabitha spot there just
privacy things so you can go like this
and open includes the mirror so if you
suck and make sure that you close the
camera when you're not using if you try
to make sure you close it because that
to be no it's not very nice to have that
open when you're not wanting it open so
the other thing is it doesn't if you
plug into a wall so if you have it
unplugged then you know that it's not
transmitting anything so alright
favorite eyeshadow palette let's go back
to other thing but it works Christie I
think it'll be worth it if it works but
we'll sing favorite eyeshadow palette of
all time by the chief in chocolate bar
palette we get that get my couple of my
face I'm getting a few whoa don't fall
don't fall no breaking no breaking I'm
getting a feel I have a few
okay we'll just get these okay favorite
probably if I had to pick one or a
product of the two faced chocolate bar
palette I just really loved the color
selection in here I think that's really
fun to play with I like that there's a
variation of light medium and deep some
tones in here I feel like the
pigmentation on most of these is really
really good this purple raised out for
me but other than that I really really
like it there's it's just a fun
eyeshadow how to play but it's very easy
to use and it smells really good and I
love this product I really really love
it and then the naked2 was the one that
made me want to do makeup make gave the
confidence and makeup I've never used
eyeshadow except for life little Revlon
quads and like things like that and then
I got this and it was like oh like I've
said this before I think I've even told
that joke before but if that's exactly
what happened when i use this I don't
have a booty call anyone a beautiful
fell out but I do love this eyeshadow
palette um I don't use it as much as I
wish I could but whenever I know I need
something I reach for that another one
that i would recommend that i really
like a lot are these buxom build your
own eyeshadow palettes oh my gosh the
quality on these my shadows is
fantastic and boxing is a brand that
doesn't get a lot of love their own i
believe by their sexual / bare minerals
and pretty sure they are the ones that
own box on but oh my gosh you got cds at
this mint green and this one right here
allow my lavish is my fav we put this
gold too they are so look how pretty you
see that shift my to my nail polish with
that oh right there right there oh my
gosh love it love it love it so these
are wonderful definitely recommend use
they seem a little pricey because he
should be flipping by each individual
shadow I think they're like 45 dollars
for one of these but totally worth it if
you fall in love with the shade it's a
really really good quality another one
that I love it's not available anymore
with the kat von d me people Roca
palette it was available last Christmas
oh my gosh this is one of my favorite I
tract health of all time and you
wouldn't think so with all these bright
colors but what she did that was genius
was she
this wheel in the middle of all these
mutual shapes so you can really balance
out these bright colors with these
neutrals and create some gorgeous looks
this is one of those pallets where I
wish I could play with it more often
because it's it's it's it's a genius
design as far as the shade selection I
feel like it's huge though sip only ruin
really rude but it's really good the kat
von d metal matt is also a really good
one but honestly you look by to pick
between this one and the metal matt i
would pick this one because i feel like
the lasting power on this one is better
than the metal mad but I mean it's both
good they're both really good yeah Ponzi
she's had one miss for me as far as I
show Pelton that was not last Christmas
for the Christmas before the one that
was spiky that one was no good for me no
bueno no bueno the one before that I
actually have on this one right here I
still keep this out for the occasional
use this was the spellbinding I shadow
book this was her first ah shadow
palette that she believes for the
holidays and I still I wish I could play
with this one more but this was
wonderful too I haven't I haven't used
this in years probably hears that I was
talking in the two-faced two-faced tart
pro tardis pro palette video about the
kat von z has a blue-green like weather
duochrome is to cut the blue green it's
also right here this one's a little more
brown not blue green well my brown green
like the mac one but uh moose wash that
one for you pick up in here this you can
see it this one's a little more brown
than green it's a little warmer but the
way that she did this and put that back
I want to fast the way she did this was
she did it in quads so you've got your
six squads to play with but then of
course should we go back and forth it
was just really smart design very fun so
that was the first one she released yeah
I would say those are my favorites I
definitely have other ones I really
really liked like the Too Faced
chocolate bon bons palette I really
really liked a lot um me see what else
the bones new dude I wish I got to use
that more the lorac pro 2 palette I
really like actually Catherine says
heparin down and check out her YouTube
channel she says what is your non
thinking pal that you use and can just
put on something like but mean I don't
have to think in order to do it that
would be that you face let you guys can
make it to by urban decay this one is
mine on thinking palette as you just go
not after that 70 says somehow i own
nothing from kat von d you need to jump
on it because it's good stuff it's
really good stuff she's pretty
consistent and poor quality Jenny t says
that used to happen all the time and it
doesn't now I'm not sure what that was
in reference to other says can't wait to
get a peek of that pastel palette by kat
von z yet oh my god so awesome I can't
wait to see it to what's on the inside
she just sneaked it this week Tracy says
would you ever hit pan on an item have
you ever hit pan on anything no I've
never had been no I don't need a pan I
don't because I'm constantly doing new
reviews and stuff so now i don't have
been the closest probably the hitting
pan i am is totally on the Naked 2 i'm
getting really close to bird birds
getting down there suspects a little bit
lower but I only hit pan and and i wish
i could i want to be able to use some of
these pelts in order to hit fan but yeah
i don't think i'd hit pan on like face
powders i'll hit panel knows i'll run
out of eyeshadow primer of a certain
eyeshadow primer of course i promote
first I prefer my mascaras I run out of
brow products I'll go through a whole
brow product I'll go through skincare
like that well finish them but as far as
I shadows and stuff I don't really do
that what make a product do you go
through the most quickly great I answer
that fantastic i'm moving to nancy says
if you get the box Natalie sent you yes
I need to respond to you Nancy on that I
think there are a few ND brand I shadows
about a velvet 59 and and in it and a
bucks and help move through you go to 30
um yes I need to collect my thoughts
Nancy before I say anything to the whole
crew Tracy says I'm loving
AVH Renaissance and Mario I took a
chance on ebay with the Mario and it was
real in under fifty dollars ooh that's
like gambling that's like straight-up
gambler must rolling the dice I am so
happy you want on that one that's
exciting Carrie Lee says did you guys

top someone's face you get the option to
go right to their channel ooh that's
cool to click on in terry Lee napkins

Heather says I hit pan on two shades
from the monahon assess holidays so say
wow already you must be love it on that
that's a new palette that's exciting all
right let's see what else have we talked
about yet if the Olivia says I'm hit
three pans when I'm not around saw Scott
man you guys are awesome Lucy says Jen
can stop buying nigga I can't
unfortunately we see that I wouldn't
have a job anymore because my job is to
review makeup that's what I do for a
living so unfortunately I can't stop
buying it but you know I don't know
that's just what I do that's my job now
so rihanna says Olivia what I shut it
open Julie's choose talking home Olivia
Julie says what's your favorite lipstick
brand liquid lipsticks my favorite
liquid lipsticks are the bear narrows
the gem nudes they're amazing the oprah
liquid lipsticks absolutely amazing um
what else those are pretty much it but I
like them but I want to practice that
cannot that's it but i want to say after
that because i already said which one
that i like them more wiki formula i
don't care as much about lasting power I
care more about comfort that's just me
personally that's the way that I roll on
those kinds of products let's say once
that for regular lipsticks I really let
the bite you you lipsticks a lot I like
the covergirl covergirl we bought ahead
for the party girl huh whoa hold up grab
some lipsticks
maybelline have their own label name
another one is that I want to mention is
the bones a liquid lipsticks really
really been enjoying those those are
very very nice they have there are a
little bit more lasting power a little
more drawing than the than the Oprah's
and the bareMinerals ones but they last
longer so can have that little trade-off
for the bone runs the four drugstore
I've had to bring out touch of spice
this is Maybelline such a spice this is
my faves and if lynn is here my friend
Lynn toward the community she came to my
husband's tattoo studio and got tattooed
she bought such a spice because of him
she didn't like it which made me feel
really sad that you didn't like it but
pretty much everybody loves such as
spies pretty much and then I do actually
really like this marc jacobs lipstick
it's very gel like and creamy this is in
the shade eat cake me swatch these for
you ok so there's eat cake but I
honestly I don't feel like lipsticks not
liquid lipsticks but lipsticks
necessarily are the most important thing
to invest in as there's touch of spice I
feel like you can get some really nice
lipsticks of a drugstore I'm not a big
lipstick person i'm more of a liquid
lipstick person so you know i will
invest in more expensive liquid
lipsticks but regular lipsticks I'll
just get Brad shades from the drugstore
for the most part what else did I want
to say that thought there was something
else in my head and then I lost it
um-hmm had it and I lost it when I'm I
had asked this as i just bought touch of
spice for my lipstick obsessed daughter
she was so excited to have the gen
favorite oh that's awesome that's very
cool Chloe says I've aided the
Maybelline creamy matte lipsticks
they're my favorites Martha says I tried
to use a palette consistently so I could
hit pan especially since there are so
many new pallets yeah I totally feel
young person says if you tried the Urban
Decay by this lipsticks I tried them
they were nice I thought they were nice
oh yes that's what I was gonna say
Stephanie Stephanie a says Jen to face
look ram that is exactly what I was
going to say when I was like I what we
know just about to sell off it I love
that you face look creme lip sticks
they're very very nice they're very
hydrating they feel really good on the
lips lasting Howard good for them for a
lipstick they're good really like them
um oh hey what's up Ilana she says bite
beauty lab has a lab in New York City
where you can make your own custom lip
color and i went there and i have a
video on it and who search for bite uni
lab you'll find the ascenian eyes video
yesenia cuevas on youtube she's linked
under that video she's one of the
moderators on our facebook page or when
he admins on my facebook page but you
said he and I went to the bite Beauty
lab in New York and we had a great time
so you can see us go through the entire
process of getting our lipsticks but
they're really expensive ruin really
expensive so I think there were like
fifty dollars lipstick something stupid
forty dollars I think at the time they
were like 40 but I think they're closer
to 50 now Gabriela says what makeup
trend you dislike the most this is me
being judgey I'm just telling you I have
no experience with this but baking I
feel like is very specific to younger
people because I've heard very negative
things about baking if you have any kind
of texture on your skin than you kind of
find how is wrinkle that it accentuates
all of that but I personally never tried
it like my friend Sandra who's also in
the community we talked about filming a
video together of trying baking as women
in our late 30s early 40s you know I'm
seeing how it works for us but that
one's probably the one I'm the least bit
with at least fog of um now we froze it
again no the end when were on periscope
everybody goes Elsa what's your favorite
foundation Stacy wants to say both
drugstore and high-end ELISA baking is
overrated yes stephanie says am
relatively young 28 bacon looks awful on
me darling says baby is for drag queens
I don't know I think that I seem looking
beautiful on lots of different people
especially on Instagram you know
I was you sitting here I didn't know you
said you was here somebody's talking to
you Sonya I didn't know she was here
sometimes she makes it and sometimes she
doesn't what's baking Hackney wants to
know and then I'll go get my foundation
baking is when you take a powder like
that like a loose powder and you pack it
on to your face so that it's super
bright and then you leave it there for a
certain amount of time I don't know how
long's I've never done it and then you
kind of rush it away and it's supposed
to really give you like a long-lasting
Matt kind of look awesome jen i'm from
argentina loving my men of renaissance
how it hit pan on three already Thank
You Barbie Thank You Barbie all for
sharing that that's amazing so many of
you hit here there is your cydia she is
here I finished one of my bikie
lipsticks from that video oh and you
have over 300 look since it's such a
good one such a good one I look
beautiful on you and you'll be able to
see for building that lipstick anyway
let me go get some foundations you got
some good one ok
okay I got a bunch this is this is a
drawer that's not so packed for BB
creams I like the Barney a BB cream a
lot this is in light medium and then the
r-mo BB cream at nine and one of skin
perfecting super makeup this is a really
good one my shade is like medium as well
I like both of these a lot lasting power
is good coverage is right but you can
but it's not enough coverage to even out
my skin tone without making you feel
like I have too much on with these are
like nice shopping day kinds of face
evening out coughs so i really like
these two as far as drugstore foundation
my favorite one is the elf moisturizing
foundation stick that i believe you has
been discontinued you can still find it
sporadically different places I'm
praying that elf brings us back because
it's so signal good look I would use
this over and over the hourglass one I
would use it over the Anasazi one ostavi
one does not have very good coverage at
all but this one is fantastic I really
love this hopefully he'll be able to
find it if you're looking for the
moisturizing foundation stick by L this
one is in the shade natural is my shitty
there another drug store that I really
like is the Maybelline matte and
poreless but be careful I've said this a
million times be careful if you have dry
skin some people drive streisand don't
really like this so if you have normal
to oily skin which is what it's
recommended for I recommend this one my
shade is number 120 it matches my skin
tone perfectly as far as high-end the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I do
really like it but it doesn't make you
look like you're born this way it
definitely is a little bit more thicker
coverage it's a little bit more um not
cake face but it's a little more opaque
so I use this a lot for filming it looks
really really nice for filming it's
beautiful for that this shape is vanilla
and I just really really like this
foundation lasting power is amazing
on this if you want a little more felt
like sometimes I'll view like one of
these Beauty creams and I want just a
little more coverage and I'll top that
with a two-phase cocoa powder foundation
smells like cocoa this is something i'm
about to get paying off and see it it's
coming but it smells really really good
and it's just a really nice way to bump
up the coverage of your foundation my
shave is light medium and another one I
really like is the hourglass immaculate
liquid to powder foundation this is
probably my favorite I and foundation
this is one you can build up the cover
so you can start off with like a light
to medium coverage and you can build it
up to closer to full I don't think it
gets all the way up to full because then
you're going to pick a face but it's a
really nice foundation this is probably
almost gone I'll be sad when this runs
out so it's really really good Irish
Rose said is that our bless the
foundation good for dry skin that's a
great question for the collective brain
of makeup awesomeness I'm honestly not
sure I can tell you though and it does
feel hydrating when I put it on it
definitely feels not dry when you put it
on like it doesn't feel like it's
pulling on the skin it's definitely a
more moist hydrating formula same with
the the on starz you want I feel the
Anasazi one is a little more moist emne
hourglass like coming from my memory but
um but yeah it's it's a nice it's a nice
one I would imagine it might be good but
I'll have to keep an eye on the
collective brain for that and missing a
lot in the chat and it seems like
there's a lot of good things so I'm
going to scroll up a little bit carolyn
says I disliked the two face foundation
it was taking and that's definitely what
I'm but I would definitely want to say I
did not find this to be cakey
specifically Carolyn but I do find it to
be more full coverage so yes I can see
why some people might find it KQ
depending on what you're used to like if
you're used to wearing beauty creams and
stuff and you get this this is going to
be too much it's going to be overkill
for you I totally agree Carolyn thank
you so much for bringing that up I
appreciate it Aspen says matte and
poreless oxide is like crazy on my oily
skin that is great to know Thank You
Aspen and then she Gary says I like Marc
Jacobs genius jail or on 70 top moda
oh where is it where to go a bit you see
that my lost it alright I'm back okay so
Nancy was kind enough to send this to me
as well and I have really been enjoying
this but I'm not quite ready to review
this is the shade beige light and the
remarkable foundation by marc jacobs i'm
still testing it it's a 10 bit darker on
me what I can deal with it I can bring
it down a little bit and it's fine but I
really really like this so far and I'm
hoping that the screen is not frozen no
it's not okay good and I've really been
enjoying this I haven't tried the genius
shell this is the remarkable I don't
know one hundred percent whether this is
worth the price or not again I'm still
testing but i do own this just wanted to
mention how all right let me go down a
little bit here steph says I do the
Wayne Goss foundation technique I Prime
and I put a little bit of foundation on
and really set it into the skin makes it
poreless not a thank you steph if you
are not subscribed Wayne Goss oh my gosh

mineral foundation but not always and
not usually during the working yes and
another a good mineral foundation
missing no I don't have any mineral
foundations except for the Mary Kay one
but I do really like the Mary Kay one I
want to get the mineral foundation from
bareMinerals but I don't own that yet
let's see Sarah says what's your ride or
die brand your favorite brand of all
time minus to face mine here's to be to
play Sarah and to face that's been
letting me down lately speaking of that
I do have a real full review of the
white chocolate chip palette that i'm
finishing up right now I'm doing the
film swatches last night on editing the
swatches I have to edit the routine
analysis and then it's done so I'm
hoping middle up tomorrow or Tuesday but
that's my next video coming up is the
two guys white chocolate chip palette
but they've been letting me down lately
so I can't say to face anymore now it's
the ball the bomb has always been one
month
brands but I feel like they're the most
consistent as far as quality so the bomb
is now my rider diagram but used to be
two-faced latina says my husband Willie
I would like to invite you in the family
over for breakfast this morning he would
like to know you to know that you
totally rock that no makeup lucky also
loved your hair oh well tell julio i
said hi and i'm sure he hears the Julio

head but holla coolio hello have a
wonderful breakfast I wish I could be
there if you're a nice person okay
Briana says I really didn't like the
two-faced foundation I really wanted to
like it brianna i would love to know why
you didn't like it I don't do like it I
have to say I have to tell you what I
think I like it so it definitely doesn't
make you look for in this way though
I'll tell you that um Steph says if an
oh I lost it man i miss you send me says
what about the it cosmetics BB cream I
had the ACOG netic CC cream it's the
wrong shape for me I need to get the
right shade so far I like it except for
that it's just not the right shade so I
have trouble um I have trouble trying it
by itself because I can't it's too
yellow it's very yellowing I think I
have a medium by accident because I
think that was what was given to me a
generation who you let me do it so call
again only this time I need to just just
suck it up and buy a new one in the
right shade um fisa says in which video
just waiting us talk about the technique
oh I don't know hmm that stuff about
that one amy says a news barrels for 10
years but I like it the its celebration
foundation better than tastes good to
know Cindy said oh you guys are talking
to each other in a second the Ann says I
love the bomb but it's expensive in
canada um they do have the sales
hopefully the sales are are effective in
canada definitely wait for the sales
because they do do that fifty percent
off sale I don't know something you hope

fifty percent of sales they just had one

the spring they usually have them about
every four months or so he says yeah not
feeling the love for the to face anymore
i love chat but he won our new pay has
been letting me down to urban decay for
me has been more consistent lately than
two faced as as far as the you see Kat
Von D Kat Von D has been very consistent
for me as well i would say Kat Von D is
it like a ninety percent for me where
the bomb is at weapon nine five percent
more two faces at like a seventy five
eighty percent accuracy for me that's
just me estimating my old teacher brave
seventy-five percent accuracy on Capri
much right now the teacher brains give
them in Gemma's dreama says that
chocolate chip outs are so tiny they are
time you'd wife I think oh it's right
here day is they are they are small um
that's why they're a chip I guess that's
kind of the arm heal behind it there a
chip but but I'm going to I'll go into
the full review this week you'll see it
but yeah they are kind of tiny i'll show
you next to my iphone 6 so that's it
next to my iphone 6 you're so you can
get a visual of how big it if they're
pretty small let's see what else oh I
used to love to face but never even

on more shades for their face products
as being shrewd tart pro to go is great
karen says and fisa says color drain has
amazing liquid lipsticks Irish Rose
wants to know if the toothpaste peach
palette is worth it let me get it for
you okay I do have a full review on it's
called the smelly pilot smackdown it's
one of the most popular videos where I
compare the peach palette with the
chocolate bar palette at me peanut
butter and jelly palette and the
chocolate bonbons and I compare them all
so you can see which one is right for
you so that might be something you want
to check out but as far as you guys know
this is coming out this week
re-releasing again um I like the way it
smells it smells like peach candy to me
I do enjoy the snow I know some people
don't enjoy it smell I personally really
like it it is very strong though just
warn you but I do enjoy it you know what
you have to do is okay number one thing
is if you have my skin tone or later
there's really not a lot of variation
for lid color for us you got this some
light stuff over here but if you want to
go light to dark there really isn't a
lot of let go I feel like this palette
is best for people medium to deep skin
tones because you're going to have a lot
more wiggle room a lot more play space
over here in these deeper colors as far
as people lighter skin tones of course
you can put a darker shade on your lid
if you choose to but there's nowhere
really to go without looking like you
got punched in the eye as far as making
it even deeper so that's part of why
look like for example if I have a medium
skin tone I can put like this green on
my or a deeper Sigma i think is green
all over my lid
and then deepen it up with some of these
deeper shades over here and it'll be
beautiful but if I have a lighter skin
tone and I put this on my lid and then I
deepen it up over here it's just going
to look duck it's just going to look
dark but you're gonna have more
separation color if you have a medium to
deeper skin tone so I feel like that's
really the best people for this palette
or people with medium to eat the skin
tones but that being said you really can
just use one of these colors over here
if you are the letter skin tone you can
use one of these colors over here just
all the time you just don't have as many
choices but I do like the color
selection the color selection is very
nice and I don't feel like the colors
money together I wish like for example
this cobbler and caramelized they're
very similar in shame so I wish that
they had included something a little bit
different I mean they're different but
on the eye they really pretty much look
the same so I wish that they had
included a little more variation in some
of these I mean even this one we put
these back and I'll put this one peach
pit so cobbler caramelize and Peach Pit
put these back were on that I can't get
that off okay we'll just put a move with
you so do you see how they're all
similar we're not the thing but they're
similar so I feel like I wish they had
given us a little more variation there
as far as tone but I mean it's a nice
palette it really you just have to
decide whether this shade collection
calls to you though they call to you it
does totally get it if it doesn't skip
it Jenny says i love the peach pop but
you're right about not using my using
multi deep colors in a look just look
dark or light skin tones exactly exactly
so you know just keep that in mind you
have to decide for yourself whether it's
something you want to go with I you know
I'm really excited about my friend Erica
that I talked about earlier erica vieira
whose podcast is beauty and the vlog who
can download it on iTunes so the most
popular beauty podcast on all of on of
YouTube and she introduced me to or
should just interviewed coffee break
with Dan we should just reviewed Sanders
Kennedy and after all she just can be
she knows all kinds of people so anyway
so she went to the peach party you guys
know if you saw on Instagram that fit to
face had that big huge party for the
release of their peach products well
we've got these big goodie bags of all
of the peach products so she got in
highlighting palette and she said it's
awesome so that's really the only thing
I'm super excited about from the peach
collection is the highlight palette I'm
gonna have a hard time not purchasing
the highlight power the blush just looks
nice to me but i don't think i'm going
to purchase it it's really that
highlight palette calling me it's
calling to you saying fine so we'll see
whether it actually gets caught or not I
don't know because I bought too much
stuff quickly especially the Smashbox
palette I was like boom when I bought
the two Smashbox palettes I was like
cringing like do I really do these but i
really want to review them i blame it on
top to talk to me to buy it so I'm
Boston Barbie doll says I love her
podcast it's so good it's so but I
actually have an interview on there she
and her give me on April I believe she
and review thing about building
community on YouTube so it's pretty
great there you go Thank You Tyra for
putting in the chat is called Beauty and
the vlog and her name is erica vieira
bri ka v IE ra yes definitely recommend
heather says I may get the peach Duke
for the makeup revolution instead that
is definitely an option definitely an
option Donna says and we're turning the
new Smashbox palette oh no well I can
always return it if I don't like it Oh
Aspen says makeup revolution neutrals
and neutrals has tons of Duke colors for
the peach palette I really enjoyed and
the price without the peach craziness
nice very good Armin says I'm so site
excited for that palette yes Jen april
says I'm dying to know everyone's
opinion on Beverly releasing the face
palette oh my goodness well let me show
you i have it hold on he get it so if
you guys don't know this this palette by
jacqueline hell did that get a better
face palette um this was supposed to be
when it's a tradition and everybody died
over it everybody wanted it it was in
stores though for quite a long time even
though it was limited edition it wasn't
stores for a while I picked this up when
I was in my road trip this summer
and I do really really like it a lot but
what people are getting upset about is
they did rerelease it for a short here
you time and then it's sold out again I
haven't heard that it's coming back for
a third time but people get really upset
like why did somebody say something you
learn in addition and then they
rerelease it kind of like the peach
palate was supposed to be one in
addition and then there be releasing it
I don't know if the peach products is
going to be permanent or not if they're
smart they'll make it for a minute but
at the same time it's like I can see
what people are coming from when you
rush and Russian Russian Russian rush to
try to get something and then it's
limited edition and you get it and then
it comes back permanent it's like well
why did I even rush to get it like I can
see that side but they're more people
get to enjoy it too so I see that side
as well so i don't know i mean this
immediate anon space palette i really
like it i don't feel like the lasting
power spray on passive on it but i do
really let the shades on the beautiful
swatch for you on the arm doing will do
underside for swatches so this one is
champagne pop this one is Prosecco pop
and then we'll do these tubes only have
all we can do this to you all of them
okay so there's that and i'll put them
on the inside so those are the two
highlighters and then these are the
washes i know that's not the best watch
as ever but that's the Jacqueline whole
one so these are the two highlights of
amusing the cheek products you like this
one's a little crazy I never reach for
this one it's a look place it reminds me
of like I'm your shade you know like
what noise does sometimes but they don't
use those crazy shade there go like what
do you do whatever you do that but
what's nice is to mix this with one of
these and that's really nice also mixing
mixing any of the blushes with the
highlights really is a beautiful glow so
but yeah
mmm Jenny says I'm not returning the
chip pallets but one shade in wait I'm
not return the chip palace but one shade
in a look only the muddy they might be
horribly end off them with OTP shadows
out um arwen says i love the blushes in
that palette april says it gives you a
by now sensation you do and then it
comes back anyway yeah exactly Russian
Russian rush to get it and then you're
like well I could just bleed it Gabriela
says I was extremely disappointed with
that palette and the blushes look like
clown makeup on my medium skin and it's
just too glittery I can totally see that
and totally see that carowinds Amanda
about something I don't know Jimmy says
I did about the product so I understand
that being upset over bringing it back
personally I'm glad they brought it back
because i missed it the first time and i
was able to get it this time Tracy says
would you consider filming and they make
up tutorial using the products I hate
video sometimes youtubers seem to be
picky seem too picky with products but
when all the makeup issues together it
really makes a difference I haven't
thought about doing that one I've seen
that that exists but I have not thought
about doing that a lot of times honestly
I get rid of products that i don't like
they end up either given being given to
someone else but feel it feel like the
usable or they end up in the trash or
they end up return so i don't know if i
have a lot of products that i think i'd
have to look through my collection and
see if i have enough to make a video out
of it melts tax melts tax you're nice i
have to say it I think the river price
but they're very very nice you say me
says I never used my peach palette i
bought it for my collection and I think
that's another reason to buy the peach
palette is if you are collector and we
specifically want this as part of your
collection some people collect you know
miniature classic cars some people
collect action figures maybe collect off
shot it cuts totally valid thing to
collect I personally would rather
collect eyeshadow palettes them the
little model classic cars that's just me
not the same price maybe a little less
for the yacht look for the eyeshadow
palette some guy brianna says Jen
remember you saying that you wanted to
try more indie brands what brands are
you wanting to try
oh my gosh so many um what is it cake
there's one that's like bakery beauty
bakery looks amazing card rain um
there's a bunch of bunk just look
awesome I want to try more so those are
the true that popped on the top of my
head let's see those are the true that
popped right right at the front of my my
brain but there's definitely other ones
but I have been trying a lot of I went I
went etsy crazy and i bought from six
different at sea brands so I'm looking
forward to filming that video I'm still
in like the later section of testing for
that stuff Gina says my husband has a
Hot Wheels collection much cheaper
sometimes police said yeah just look at
Tara Tara tar babies collection it blows
my mind every to my watcher I know can
you imagine can you imagine yeah I need
more makeup geek in my life I don't have
enough makeup eat um yeah tara has those
big like utility cases for her makeup
look and she's constantly doing halls of
like 15 thought so she does probably too
old in a month unless 15 products that
she gets like and not cheap Ra'zac
expensive product but that's why i love
tar there because tara has such an a
perspective because she's tried so much
makeup she has such a great perspective
on what's good and what's not just tried
everything from Tom Ford down to like
wet and wild and you know like the
